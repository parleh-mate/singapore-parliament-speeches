And indeed this privilege  of\r\n\r\nspeech  is  empowered  in the  Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\n(Privileges,  Immunities and  Powers)  Ordinance  of\r\n\r\n1962.  In fact, in the evidence given by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson himself on the 26th June, he admitted that\r\n\r\nthere could be no breach of privilege. I quote  from\r\n\r\npage C24 of the Report, col. 23, questions 52 to 54:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'52.

Mr Rajah: That is what I was trying to get at.\r\n\r\nIf anything is to arise out of this, it is under the\r\n\r\nhead  of  abuse  of privilege and not  a  breach  of\r\n\r\nprivilege?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: I think that is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;54. Mr Rajah: You will accept that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Marshall: I think so, yes.

The  position  of\r\n\r\nMembers  during  a debate in the Assembly  has  been\r\n\r\nvery  succinctly and aptly described by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer  Park in the Minutes of  Evidence  - page\r\n\r\nC32,  col. 40, question 120. This is what the Member\r\n\r\nfor Farrer Park said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'120. Mr Rajah: There is this one aspect that is\r\n\r\nworrying  me.  It  seems to  me,  listening  to  Mr\r\n\r\nMarshall,  that it is a question of strong  language\r\n\r\nbordering on whatever he feels it is. Now,  on  that\r\n\r\naspect,  Mr David Marshall, if I enter a boxing  ring,  I\r\n\r\nexpect  to be hit and hit hard with the gloves;  and\r\n\r\nif  I enter the political arena, I expect to be  hit\r\n\r\nhard,  I  must not be over squeamish. Now I am  just\r\n\r\nwondering,  Mr David Marshall,  whether,  we  all  being\r\n\r\npoliticians,  we hit hard sometimes and  if  someone\r\n\r\nhits us equally hard, should we object?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real complaint by the Member for Anson can be\r\n\r\nseen in his reply.

The\r\n\r\nstatements also contain comments which are  critical\r\n\r\nof  and  express opinions in regard to the political\r\n\r\nconduct and activities of Mr David Marshall at that\r\n\r\ntime. The denials made by Mr David Marshall do not,\r\n\r\nin  the view of your Committee, take the matter  any\r\n\r\nfurther.  They  merely served to and did  excite  an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  political arguments, a great  deal  of\r\n\r\nwhich  was  irrelevant  to  the  issue  before  your\r\n\r\nCommittee.  As the contending arguments put  forward\r\n\r\ncan  be  honestly  maintained on either  side,  your\r\n\r\nCommittee consider that it cannot be said  that  the\r\n\r\nstatements complained of are false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. Your Committee, therefore, find that the claim\r\n\r\nby  Mr David Marshall that in making the statements\r\n\r\ncomplained  of, Dr Goh Keng Swee was guilty  of  an\r\n\r\nabuse of privilege cannot be sustained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. Your Committee note that the language used by\r\n\r\nDr  Goh Keng Swee was couched in intemperate terms,\r\n\r\nbut,  having  regard to the heat of the moment,  and\r\n\r\nthe  undoubted provocation accorded to Dr Goh  Keng\r\n\r\nSwee  as  a Member of the Government when Mr  David\r\n\r\nMarshall  criticised the Government for the  use  of\r\n\r\nmilitary forces\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"in a highly provocative manner\", your Committee\r\n\r\nmake no recommendation in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.

I am merely seeking to draw attention and\r\n\r\nto  give thanks to those who saw the point and  gave\r\n\r\nassistance  in a matter of some importance  to  this\r\n\r\nHouse. If you will bear with me, I will not be long,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying that in Singapore the requirement for\r\n\r\na  supporter  to  sign the motion  paper  means,  in\r\n\r\neffect,   that  an  independent  Member  or   single\r\n\r\nrepresentative  of his Party in the Assembly  is  in\r\n\r\nthe acutely difficult position of having to hawk his\r\n\r\nmotion  around to other Opposition Parties, pleading\r\n\r\nfor  a  supporter, and very often, Sir - I mean, there\r\n\r\nis no secret about this - I found that though a motion\r\n\r\nhas  the  goodwill, support, and sympathy  of  other\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Opposition side, nevertheless,  for\r\n\r\nparty reasons or for other reasons,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport  has not been forthcoming in actual fact  in\r\n\r\nthe   concrete   form  of  a  signatures,   I   must\r\n\r\nnevertheless express my indebtedness to the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  as well as to the independent  Member  for\r\n\r\nJoo  Chiat  for  having come to my  assistance  very\r\n\r\noften  in  the  past in order to  bring  matters  of\r\n\r\nnational moment before this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am indebted to the Member for Hong Lim who,\r\n\r\nbecoming conscious of the unfairness of the existing\r\n\r\nprovisions, was good enough to bring the  matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of this House in  his  motion  and\r\n\r\nthereby started the machinery in the Standing Orders\r\n\r\nCommittee.  Sir, the Report of the  Committee  is  a\r\n\r\ncompromise between the suggestion of the Member for\r\n\r\nHong  Lim and the existing position. If adopted,  it\r\n\r\nmeans  that  in future an independent Member,  or  a\r\n\r\nsingle  representative  of his  Party,  may  have  a\r\n\r\nmotion tabled, and may in this Assembly rise to move\r\n\r\nit,  and  it is only at that stage that the  Speaker\r\n\r\nwill  require that the Member signified  support  in\r\n\r\nprinciple. This is a considerable improvement to the\r\n\r\nexisting  position, and I would like  to  take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity. Mr Speaker, of expressing appreciation\r\n\r\nfor a very helpful provision, not only to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Hong  Lim  who initiated it, but  also  to  the\r\n\r\nconstructive efforts of the Member for Cairnhill who\r\n\r\nshowed   considerable  conciliatory  abilities   and\r\n\r\ncontributed to a solution at a stage when it  seemed\r\n\r\nthat  the  adamant P.A.P. intransigence would  prove\r\n\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I say, with respect, that\r\n\r\nI  am  indebted for the very considerable assistance\r\n\r\nand guidance given by you in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to support this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson   is   very  profuse  with  his  thanks   this\r\n\r\nafternoon.

To refresh the minds of Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse. Sir, perhaps - I do not have with me a copy  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government statement - but I will read  out  what\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times reported in its Sunday edition  on\r\n\r\nthe 10th of June, 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Government has information also that these\r\n\r\npersons  will  at this meeting form an  organisation\r\n\r\nsimilar   to   the  1956  civil  rights  convention\r\n\r\ncommittee  in  order to promote further  agitation,\"\r\n\r\nthe statement said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it added: \"Their move is in fact a repetition\r\n\r\nof  the  history leading up to the riots of  October\r\n\r\n1956.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, in the statement, the Government went\r\n\r\nto  the  absurd extent of suggesting that the  Civil\r\n\r\nRights  Convention  in  1956  was  organised  by   a\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  11 members and that the Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee which called these meetings at the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Motor Workshop Employees Union  was  also\r\n\r\ncomposed of 11 men and that, therefore, riots  would\r\n\r\nfollow. Sir, this is utter stupidity and shows  that\r\n\r\neven  logic has departed from Government propaganda.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  this suggestion, that because  there\r\n\r\nwas  rioting in 1956 there will be rioting in  1962,\r\n\r\nmust  be examined and answered at the outset. And  I\r\n\r\npropose  to do this before I recount all the  events\r\n\r\nthat  led  up  to the meetings and the circumstances\r\n\r\nunder which the meetings were banned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government suggestion meant that the\r\n\r\npurpose of the Trade Unions Working Committee was to\r\n\r\nincite rioting. Firstly, Sir, one cannot assume that\r\n\r\nthe  riots  in  1956 were the result  of  the  Civil\r\n\r\nRights  Convention, and one cannot assume  that  the\r\n\r\n1956  riots  were  caused by the organisers  of  the\r\n\r\nconvention. As a matter of fact, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  made  suggestions to this  effect  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  in  1956  when he sought  to  move  a  motion\r\n\r\ncondemning the Government for its arrest of  people\r\n\r\nwho  were closely associated with the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  his  political life. Secondly. Sir, it would  be\r\n\r\nwrong  to  assume that there will be riots if  these\r\n\r\nmeetings of the trade unions and civic organisations\r\n\r\nare  permitted. I fail to understand how the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership could be so absurd in their reasoning. To\r\n\r\nsay  that there were riots in 1956 because there was\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Rights Convention and, therefore,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  riots in 1962 if the Trade Unions  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee  were allowed to organise a convention  is\r\n\r\nas  absurd as to say that because Mr Harry Lee  was\r\n\r\nin  Fraser's Hill playing golf in 1956 and there was\r\n\r\na  riot in Singapore, there will be another riot  in\r\n\r\n1962  should Mr Harry Lee run to Fraser's  Hill  to\r\n\r\nplay golf --- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wonder who Mr Harry Lee is. He is a\r\n\r\nstranger in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Harry Lee, prior to 1959, Sir, was the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the People's Action  Party.  He\r\n\r\nhappens  to  be the Prime Minister of the Government\r\n\r\nand,  to keep in line. Sir, I should substitute \"the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister\" for \"Mr Harry Lee\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, are the P.A.P. so desperate that they have\r\n\r\nlost all sense of logic? It is not necessary for  me\r\n\r\nto   illustrate  further  their  muddled   thinking.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is interesting to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nthis  House to one aspect in the comparison  of  the\r\n\r\nCivil Rights Convention and the present Trade Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee. It is that the Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\nnow  not the legal adviser to this Committee  or  to\r\n\r\nthe unions which attended\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  meeting  called  by  this  Committee.  Sir,  if\r\n\r\nnothing else, this fact may yet show that there will\r\n\r\nbe no rioting in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me stress that a study of the\r\n\r\nevents in the past has shown that whenever there was\r\n\r\nrioting,  it was preceded by police provocation.  If\r\n\r\nthere  were  no  provocation,  there  would  be   no\r\n\r\nrioting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government banned these two meetings which\r\n\r\nwere  called in the premises of the Singapore  Motor\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees Union to discuss  matters  of\r\n\r\nnational  importance. The first meeting, Sir,  which\r\n\r\nhad  been scheduled for 9th June, 1962, was to  have\r\n\r\nbeen  attended  by representatives of trade  unions,\r\n\r\nrural  dwellers,  University students,  professional\r\n\r\norganisations  and  other civic  organisations.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  meeting, Sir, which had been  scheduled  for\r\n\r\n16th  June,  1962,  was  to have  been  attended  by\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  trade unions  only.  Sir,  both\r\n\r\nthese  meetings were convened by the Singapore Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Working  Committee, a Committee  of  liaison\r\n\r\nofficers  of  about 40 trade unions  representing  a\r\n\r\ntotal membership of more than 100,000 workers.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Committee  was appointed  on  5th  June  at  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  held  by representatives of over  40  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  This Committee was appointed in the context\r\n\r\nof  a  situation wherein the civil rights of workers\r\n\r\nand  of our people as a whole were being shamelessly\r\n\r\nthreatened by a discredited Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5th of June meeting was called to discuss the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   attitude   to   the   National    Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations  organised by these trade unions.  This\r\n\r\nmeeting,  Sir, also discussed briefly the Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.  It is interesting, Mr Speaker, to note  that\r\n\r\nthe Government took no action whatsoever to ban this\r\n\r\nmeeting  nor did any riots result from  it,  and  it\r\n\r\nalso  took  no  action  whatsoever  against  similar\r\n\r\nmeetings in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that sometime in May these\r\n\r\nvery    unions    had   enthusiastically    accepted\r\n\r\ninvitations  from the Government to  participate  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government-sponsored National Day celebrations.\r\n\r\nHowever, a few days later,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  unions  announced  their  withdrawal  from  the\r\n\r\ncelebrations  at  the Padang. This was  because  the\r\n\r\nunions  became  aware  of  the  P.A.P.  Government's\r\n\r\nintention   to   make  use  of  the   National   Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations as political propaganda in  support  of\r\n\r\ntheir infamous merger proposals. The Government  was\r\n\r\nplanning  to interpret the turn-up at the Padang  as\r\n\r\nindicative of mass popular approval of the  P.A.P.'s\r\n\r\nplan  to shackle the people of Singapore with  their\r\n\r\nmerger   plot.   Sir,  this  is  the  characteristic\r\n\r\nbehaviour of the P.A.P., dishonestly distorting  the\r\n\r\npeople's     wishes    and    expressions.     These\r\n\r\ncharacteristics of the P.A.P. leaders, Sir, have now\r\n\r\nsuccessfully invaded and entrenched themselves among\r\n\r\nthe  laws  of  the country. And, Sir,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill as an outstanding example which  has\r\n\r\nmanaged to pass through this House in spite  of  the\r\n\r\noverwhelming opposition to it amongst our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to frustrate this dishonest scheme of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P., the trade unions decided to observe the\r\n\r\nNational Day with separate celebrations. A rally  of\r\n\r\nworkers was organised to be held on 3rd June at  the\r\n\r\nHappy  World Stadium. An application was made for  a\r\n\r\npermit; a permit was given subject to ten conditions\r\n\r\nwhich  included  a  ban on the display  of  national\r\n\r\nemblems.  Sir,I do not `want to read  out  the  ten\r\n\r\nconditions,  but I do want to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nMembers of this House to a few of these conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The condition that prohibited the display of\r\n\r\nnational emblems was condition No. 6, which reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Persons attending must not display national\r\n\r\nemblems.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sorry, Sir, this is not from the Straits Times. This\r\n\r\nhappens   to  be  from  the  only  English  language\r\n\r\nnewspaper which contains the truth, and that is  the\r\n\r\nPlebeian. And I must recommend it to this  House  to\r\n\r\nread. This is the Plebeian, a fortnightly paper  for\r\n\r\nthe  common man. And it happens to be the  organ  of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the condition which I read out just now is\r\n\r\ninteresting  because  this was  supposed  to  be  in\r\n\r\nconnection   with  the  National  Day  celebrations.\r\n\r\nNational  Day  celebrations are  celebrations  which\r\n\r\ntrade  unions want to observe, and yet  one  of  the\r\n\r\nconditions was that they should not display national\r\n\r\nemblems. One other condition that I want to draw the\r\n\r\nattention of this House to is condition No. 2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No processions are formed either proceeding to\r\n\r\njoin  the  assembly or leaving the assembly  on  the\r\n\r\ntermination of the meeting.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  here \"procession\" does not necessarily mean  a\r\n\r\nprocession  where  banners  are  carried  and  where\r\n\r\nhundreds of people march. A procession can  mean,  I\r\n\r\nam told, five people walking together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the conditions were difficult\r\n\r\nconditions to be strictly observed, the trade unions\r\n\r\nwere  prepared to go on with the rally. But  at  the\r\n\r\nvery  last moment, the Government issued a statement\r\n\r\nsaying  that  if  any  of  the  ten  conditions  was\r\n\r\nbreached - any  of the ten conditions was breached - the\r\n\r\nregistration of the trade union concerned  would  be\r\n\r\ncancelled.  As  I said, it is almost  impossible  to\r\n\r\nensure that none of the conditions is breached,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, the two conditions that I read out. It is difficult - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have followed the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  carefully. This is in relation to  something\r\n\r\nthat  happened on 3rd June. It does not seem  to  be\r\n\r\ntouched upon by the motion which deplores the action\r\n\r\nof  the Government in preventing workers, etc., from\r\n\r\nexercising their civic rights in discussing  matters\r\n\r\nof  national importance affecting all of  them,  and\r\n\r\ncondemns the Government for using its. Police  Force\r\n\r\non  9th  and  16th  June - preventing representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  exercising  their civic rights  in  discussing\r\n\r\nmatters  of national importance. I do not  know  how\r\n\r\nthis ties up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, I appear to be dwelling on\r\n\r\nthis,  but what I, in fact, seek to do is to briefly\r\n\r\nset out the circumstances under which the Committee\r\n\r\nwhich convened the meetings on the 9th and 16th was\r\n\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did anticipate that. But I\r\n\r\nthink  the Member is going into too much detail.  If\r\n\r\nhe  is  just leading up to that point, then  he  can\r\n\r\ntouch on these incidents very briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Very well, I will not go into further\r\n\r\ndetails.  It was clear from the conditions and  from\r\n\r\nthe  Press  statement that the  Government  in  its\r\n\r\ndesperation  would use any excuse to deregister  the\r\n\r\nunions. In the face of this threat, the unions  were\r\n\r\nnot able to celebrate National Day and the rally was\r\n\r\ncancelled. Following this, on 5th June, the 40 trade\r\n\r\nunions   met  and  discussed  the  whole  situation,\r\n\r\nincluding  the  threat posed to the people  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers by the Referendum Bill. At this meeting  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions  Working Committee  was  appointed  to\r\n\r\nconvene a delegates' meeting of various trade unions\r\n\r\nand  civic  organisations. As  I  have  pointed  out\r\n\r\nearlier on, the Government took no action whatsoever\r\n\r\nto ban the meeting held on the 5th of June as it had\r\n\r\ntaken  no  action whatsoever to ban similar meetings\r\n\r\nin  the past. Accordingly, the Committee convened  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  of  about 100 organisations to  consider  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration on the Referendum Bill. Here I must  say\r\n\r\nbriefly  that we must not lose sight of  the  threat\r\n\r\nposed by the Referendum Bill which naturally aroused\r\n\r\napprehension among the workers who were  represented\r\n\r\nby these organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P., burdened with the guilt of its\r\n\r\ntreachery  to  the people, was bent on checking  the\r\n\r\nexpression  of all popular views of the  people  and\r\n\r\nthe  organisations. Burdened with this guilt, it was\r\n\r\nalso looking for any excuse to remove from the scene\r\n\r\nany  organisation that opposed and exposed its  evil\r\n\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 9th June, in the 7 p.m. news of Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore,  a  special announcement of a  Government\r\n\r\nstatement   was   made.  In  this   statement,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment threatened these organisations. And if  I\r\n\r\nmay  briefly read what the Sunday Times of 10th June\r\n\r\nhas to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'An hour before the meeting was to be held [you\r\n\r\nwill  note, Sir, just one hour - in fact, it was  less\r\n\r\nthan  one  hour; they could have very well  informed\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  very much earlier] in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMotor Workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union  in Bukit Timah Road,  the  Police\r\n\r\nissued  this  warning to the organisers,  \"Call  off\r\n\r\nthis illegal assembly or face immediate action.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  this  Government statement was  put  over  the\r\n\r\nradio  as  a special announcement and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  scores of police and Special Branch  officers\r\n\r\nwere  sent  to  the premises of the  Motor  Workshop\r\n\r\nEmployees'  Union where the meeting was to  be  held\r\n\r\nand  the  members of the Committee were each  served\r\n\r\nwith  a  letter  which said that the meeting  was  a\r\n\r\npublic assembly and, as such, illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an account of what happened from here onwards\r\n\r\nis  given in the Memorandum of Appeal to all Members\r\n\r\nof  this House sent by the Working Committee of  the\r\n\r\n40 trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the members of the Committee were\r\n\r\nadvised  and  were fully aware that the meeting  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  public assembly and that it was well  within\r\n\r\ntheir  rights  to  proceed with  the  meeting,  they\r\n\r\ncalled it off because they knew the intention of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Sir, the Government have  been  looking\r\n\r\nfor  some  excuse to provoke violence  and  step  up\r\n\r\ntheir  repressive  measures. In  the  face  of  open\r\n\r\nprovocation  by  an  unreasonable  Government,   the\r\n\r\nunions  on their part showed extreme reasonableness.\r\n\r\nThey  showed  the same restraint and  reasonableness\r\n\r\nthey    had   exercised   on   previous   occasions,\r\n\r\nparticularly in the case of calling off the National\r\n\r\nDay celebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following this disgraceful Government attitude\r\n\r\nof  denying free discussion on the unfair Referendum\r\n\r\nBill,  of  denying the democratic  rights  of,  free\r\n\r\nassociation and free communication, the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee proceeded to convene a meeting  of\r\n\r\nthe  40  odd unions in order to report on the  grave\r\n\r\nsituation  that  had arisen. In  other  words,  they\r\n\r\nmerely convened a meeting of the same people who had\r\n\r\nappointed them to report back. This was the meeting,\r\n\r\nSir,  which was convened for Saturday, 16th June.  A\r\n\r\nmeeting of union representatives of this nature  was\r\n\r\nnot  unusual in Singapore. There are precedents. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  had never interfered with such  meetings\r\n\r\nin  the  past. It is needless to say that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthemselves,   including  people  like   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,   the  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture, the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health, etc., had convened similar\r\n\r\nmeetings  in  the past. In fact, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nused  to  be a regular speaker in these meetings  in\r\n\r\nthe   years  prior  to  1959.  However,   Sir,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  once again was determined to deny  these\r\n\r\norganisations  the  right to  discuss  matters  that\r\n\r\naffected all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of 16th June, the Committee's\r\n\r\nChairman  and the Secretary were informed  that  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  would be unlawful - only this  time  by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies and not by the Acting  Deputy\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Police. Sir, once again, the  unions\r\n\r\ncancelled the meeting. The primary consideration for\r\n\r\nthe  cancellation of the meeting was to prevent  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  from  having an  opportunity  to  incite\r\n\r\nviolence.  I must say that at the second meeting  on\r\n\r\nthe  16th, there were more policemen than there were\r\n\r\nin  fact  at the first meeting. Sir, in calling  off\r\n\r\nthis  meeting, once again the unions showed  extreme\r\n\r\nrestraint  and reasonableness in the face of  direct\r\n\r\nprovocation. Sir, one could not truthfully say  that\r\n\r\nthe  unions wanted to create trouble. Had the unions\r\n\r\nwanted  to create trouble, had the unions wanted  to\r\n\r\nincite  violence  - as  the  Government  suggest  the\r\n\r\nobvious  thing  to  do  was to  carry  on  with  the\r\n\r\nmeetings. Sir, if the objective of the unions was to\r\n\r\ncreate  tension and violence, obviously they  should\r\n\r\nhave continued with their plans for the National Day\r\n\r\ncelebrations   for   example.   They   should   have\r\n\r\ndeliberately  defied the Government conditions,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  the  one banning the display  of  national\r\n\r\nemblems, and invited Police action. Sir, even though\r\n\r\nthe  unions and their leaders had repeatedly  shown\r\n\r\ntheir  reasonableness, the Government accusation  is\r\n\r\nthat they are subversive elements and that they want\r\n\r\nto provoke violence. The facts clearly show that the\r\n\r\nact of provocation was on the part of the Government\r\n\r\neven  to  the  extent of sending police officers  to\r\n\r\nchallenge the Secretary of the Trade Unions Working\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee to go on with the meeting. Sir, if Members\r\n\r\nof this House will read the memorandum that has been\r\n\r\nsent,  they  will find the exact words used  in  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  the  Secretary of  the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee. The facts show beyond doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  unions have been tolerant. The leaders of these\r\n\r\nunions   who   are   accused  of   being   dangerous\r\n\r\nadventurers have shown restraint and they have  been\r\n\r\nextremely  responsible, The repeated  cancelling  of\r\n\r\nlegitimate  meetings - meetings that conform  to  the\r\n\r\nrules  and regulations of the unions, meetings  that\r\n\r\nwere  legally  constituted, meetings that  were  not\r\n\r\nuncommon in the history of the Singapore trade union\r\n\r\nmovement   - cannot   be   said   to   be   acts   of\r\n\r\nunreasonableness. Sir, these are not actions of  men\r\n\r\nwho  want  trouble  or  want  to  be  provoked  into\r\n\r\ntrouble.  As  I have said, there are precedents  for\r\n\r\nsimilar meetings. These are known to some Members of\r\n\r\nthe  House.  As  I  have said,  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself  has  been associated with such meetings  in\r\n\r\nthe  past  and, Sir, only recently after  his  world\r\n\r\ntour,  in early June this year - I believe it was  on\r\n\r\nthe  1st  of  June  this year  - the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\naddressed   a   meeting   of   some   trade    union\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  on Malaysia at the Headquarters  of\r\n\r\nthe  St.  John Ambulance Brigade. Sir, the convenors\r\n\r\nof  these meetings had no doubt whatsoever that  the\r\n\r\nunions   were   acting  within  the   constitutional\r\n\r\nauthority    of    their    respective    registered\r\n\r\norganisations. The Government, in disallowing  these\r\n\r\nmeetings,  merely  said that they  would  constitute\r\n\r\npublic  assembly. Sir, in a letter dated  9th  June,\r\n\r\n1962,  the  Acting  Deputy  Commissioner  of  Police\r\n\r\nstated  that  the  Singapore  Trade  Unions  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee was organising a public assembly, I should\r\n\r\nlike to read this letter which is, in fact, attached\r\n\r\nto  the Memorandum of Appeal to all Members of  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It is dated 9th June and the first paragraph\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It has come to my notice that you and certain\r\n\r\nother persons calling yourselves the Singapore Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Working  Committee have organised  a  public\r\n\r\nassembly to be held in the premises of the Singapore\r\n\r\nMotor Workshop Employees' Union.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  he  also  suggested in this  letter  that  the\r\n\r\npromotion of that meeting would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe an offence, but he did not quote any relevant law\r\n\r\nto substantiate this suggestion. Paragraph 2 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have ascertained that you have not applied for\r\n\r\nand  obtained a permit or licence to hold or conduct\r\n\r\nsuch  assembly; and I am therefore to warn you  that\r\n\r\nyou and your colleagues on the Working Committee and\r\n\r\nany  other persons responsible for the promotion  of\r\n\r\nsuch  assembly will be committing an offence if  you\r\n\r\nhold such assembly as planned by you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  when  pressed  for  further  explanation,  the\r\n\r\nActing  Deputy Commissioner of Police stated in  his\r\n\r\nletter of 14th June, 1962, that these meetings would\r\n\r\nbe  public  meetings in that they  came  within  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"public entertainment\" in the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I refer to the letter dated 14th June\r\n\r\naddressed  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee. The second paragraph, after  the\r\n\r\nfirst line, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am advised that addresses, debates and\r\n\r\ndiscussions at any place to which the public or  any\r\n\r\nclass of the public has access would come within the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"public entertainment\" in the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance, 1958.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  he further stated - though very vaguely  in  his\r\n\r\nletter - that  there  were  provisions  in  the  Minor\r\n\r\nOffences Ordinance which could also be applied.  But\r\n\r\nhe  did  not  quote any particular sections  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance. This was on the 14th. Subsequently,  Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  16th June, 1962, the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\nstated in his letter that these meetings would be in\r\n\r\ncontravention of the Societies Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say quite categorically that the issue\r\n\r\ninvolved  is  essentially  a  political  issue.  The\r\n\r\ndenial  of free association and free expression  is,\r\n\r\nin fact, a denial of a fundamental democratic right.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  an  issue which involves  merely  legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities.   Sir,  we  are   aware   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  seeking to hide  behind  some  silly\r\n\r\nlegal technicalities. This, Sir, is the tragedy of a\r\n\r\nshameless Government which does not have the decency\r\n\r\nto  allow  the  people their basic  rights.  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nGovernment  which  makes unfair laws  has  no  moral\r\n\r\nright  and  no  justification to use those  laws  to\r\n\r\ndeprive our people and their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlegitimate  organisations freedom of expression.  In\r\n\r\nshort,  a Government which is capable of shamelessly\r\n\r\nmaking  a law like the National Referendum Bill  has\r\n\r\nno   moral  right  to  justify  its  act  by  unfair\r\n\r\ninterpretation of unjust laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, on the legal aspect of the\r\n\r\nissue, the position is quite clear as far as we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. The Government has sought deliberately to\r\n\r\ngive an unfair interpretation to the laws concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Government's interpretation, Sir, is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe  legal  opinion  given  by  a  leading  firm  of\r\n\r\nadvocates and solicitors has been attached - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nT. T.

He  adopts  that\r\n\r\nopinion  as his own. He can just say, \"I am  advised\r\n\r\nthat this is the law\" and that is the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> That is exactly what I am going to do,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I was saying just now  that  the\r\n\r\ninterpretation the Government has given to  the  law\r\n\r\nis,  in  my view, ridiculous. Sir, I wish  to  quote\r\n\r\nhere  what  I am advised to be the legal opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe  interpretation of the relevant Ordinances. Sir,\r\n\r\nfor our purposes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An unlawful society is any club, company-,\r\n\r\npartnership  or association of ten or  more  persons\r\n\r\nthat is not registered.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  am  reading from page 2 - somewhere in the middle\r\n\r\nof the page:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The hundred persons together with the nine do not\r\n\r\nconstitute   a   society  because  they   have   not\r\n\r\nconstituted themselves in any way.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hundred persons referred to the persons who\r\n\r\nattended  the  meeting and the  nine  to  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Working  Committee. Sir,  the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee originally had 11 members. When it\r\n\r\nwas  pointed out by the Registrar that  it  was  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  have eleven members, two were  knocked\r\n\r\noff and the Committee was composed of nine members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They do not have any organisational attributes of\r\n\r\na  club,  company,  partnership or  association  but\r\n\r\nremain  merely  delegates attending a  meeting.  Any\r\n\r\nother construction of section 12 will again lead  to\r\n\r\nthe  most absurd result. Every person attending  the\r\n\r\nforum  organised  by  the  University  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nStudents' Union on 19th June would have committed an\r\n\r\noffence.   When   Radio  Singapore  invited   eleven\r\n\r\nnewspapers  or news agencies to send representatives\r\n\r\nto  attend  a  meeting  and submit  questions  to  a\r\n\r\npolitical  figure, and they did attend,  they  would\r\n\r\nconstitute an unlawful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsociety.  So  would  a  Press  conference  similarly\r\n\r\nattended.  Occasions such as these occur  frequently\r\n\r\nwithout anyone being prosecuted under the Ordinance.\r\n\r\nThis  leads me to believe that the proposed  meeting\r\n\r\nwould  not  be an unlawful society whether  of  nine\r\n\r\npersons or of 109 persons.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to add here that it is common\r\n\r\nknowledge  that there are hundreds and  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nsocial gatherings every day in Singapore where  more\r\n\r\nthan  nine people attend. The Prime Minister himself\r\n\r\ncalls   Press   conferences  of  more  than   eleven\r\n\r\nreporters. Sir, a strict application of the law will\r\n\r\nsimply  mean that all these gatherings are  unlawful\r\n\r\nassemblies and that before they could meet they must\r\n\r\nget a police permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1956, the Prime Minister was the legal\r\n\r\nadviser  to many trade unions in Singapore.  He  was\r\n\r\nassociated  with  meetings of a  similar  nature  in\r\n\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I warned them often that it\r\n\r\nwas illegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nwould like to rise on a point of elucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.

What\r\n\r\nhe  does is to tell an intending criminal that  what\r\n\r\nhe  is  doing  is running the risk of violating  the\r\n\r\nlaw. If the criminal wants to carry on with it,  the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser does not thereby become a criminal. He\r\n\r\nhas advised against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> If the Prime Minister is a little\r\n\r\npatient,  I will come in due course to what  he  has\r\n\r\njust  said.

Sir, as a  legal  adviser,  he\r\n\r\nadmits  that it was his responsibility to  see  that\r\n\r\nthese organisations that he advised conformed to the\r\n\r\nlaws  of  the  country. The fact that he  associated\r\n\r\nhimself with such meetings and the fact that he  did\r\n\r\nnot tell the unions - this we have ascertained, and  I\r\n\r\nshall, Mr Speaker, Sir, in due course, refer  to  a\r\n\r\nparticular  meeting, and then find out  whether  the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  advised  against   that   meeting.\r\n\r\nHowever,  even  if  the  Prime  Minister - even   for\r\n\r\npurposes of argument - advised the unions to take  out\r\n\r\na  permit,  and,  in  fact, the unions  took  out  a\r\n\r\npermit - the police gave the permit - surely now that he\r\n\r\nis the Prime Minister of the State of Singapore, why\r\n\r\ndoes he not want to give the unions a permit to hold\r\n\r\nthis  meeting?  Sir, I am not saying for  a  moment,\r\n\r\nneither  are  the unions of Singapore saying  for  a\r\n\r\nmoment,  that  we want to carry on holding  meetings\r\n\r\nwithout police permits. Sir, never mind about  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  Political parties which are represented  in\r\n\r\nthis  House  were denied police permits  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  only last week. I shall deal with it  in  a\r\n\r\nshort while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that the Prime Minister is not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  suggest that he participated in  unlawful\r\n\r\nmeetings and advised on their promotion knowing  the\r\n\r\nmeetings to have been unlawful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 the Prime Minister was the legal adviser\r\n\r\nto  many unions which took part in the Civil  Rights\r\n\r\nConvention. Sir, my understanding is that  he  never\r\n\r\nwarned them that it was against the law to hold such\r\n\r\na convention. He never warned that trade unions were\r\n\r\ncontravening   the   Trade   Unions   Ordinance   in\r\n\r\nparticipating  at the convention, as the  Government\r\n\r\nstatement  suggested, when banning the two  meetings\r\n\r\ncalled  by  the Trade Unions Working Committee  last\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my simple mind, the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nconduct  in 1956 must have been necessarily  due  to\r\n\r\none of the following three reasons: (1) He did not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  the law; (2) he knew the law and he knew  that\r\n\r\nthe  meetings were perfectly legal; and (3) that  he\r\n\r\nknew the law and he knew that it was not lawful  but\r\n\r\nin  fact  he - wanted the Unions to get into  trouble\r\n\r\nand thus he did not advise against it. Sir, I cannot\r\n\r\nthink  that  the  Prime Minister,  who  was  then  a\r\n\r\nprominent  lawyer, would have acted on the  grounds\r\n\r\nof  the  last  reason because that would  have  been\r\n\r\nunethical.  It cannot be suggested that he  did  not\r\n\r\nknow the law - that is reason No. (1) - for that would\r\n\r\nbe  an  insult  to his intelligence. Therefore,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the logical conclusion that I can come\r\n\r\nto  is  that the Prime Minister knew the law and  he\r\n\r\nknew  that it was perfectly lawful for trade  unions\r\n\r\nto participate in such conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion before the House rightly condemns\r\n\r\nthe Government for using its police force on the 9th\r\n\r\nand  16th of June to intimidate and prevent meetings\r\n\r\nthat  were  to be held in the premises of the  Motor\r\n\r\nShop  Employees Union. The Government objective  was\r\n\r\nclearly  to  prevent  the unions  from  holding  any\r\n\r\ndiscussion  on the Referendum Bill, no  matter  what\r\n\r\nthe  consequences were. The Government, in using the\r\n\r\npolice  force,  was  consciously trying  to  provoke\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Sir, an atmosphere of tension was  created\r\n\r\nby  the  deliberate presence of uniformed  policemen\r\n\r\nand  Special  Branch officers. Sir, riot  vans  were\r\n\r\nkept  waiting.  The scene was set by the  Government\r\n\r\nitself  to create an explosive situation.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention to provoke trouble is clearly\r\n\r\nseen  by the fact that it was only at the very  last\r\n\r\nmoment  that  they sought to inform  the  organisers\r\n\r\nthat  the  meeting  of  the 9th  of  June  would  be\r\n\r\nunlawful.  It was only in the words of  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, one hour before the meeting was scheduled  to\r\n\r\nstart  that  the  Government  announcement  of   the\r\n\r\nbanning of the meeting was made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we have a Government that is prepared\r\n\r\nto  go  to any limit to continue its political life.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  is  prepared  to  pass  unfair  and\r\n\r\nundemocratic  laws  which are in conflict  with  the\r\n\r\nfundamentals  of democracy. The P.A.P. leaders  who\r\n\r\ncall themselves democrats,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho profess to be champions of  democracy,\r\n\r\nare today by their very actions, destroying the very\r\n\r\nfoundations of a democratic society. Sir, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nseeks  to  use  this  Assembly  and  the  Government\r\n\r\nmachinery  to ensure the continuity of its political\r\n\r\nlife.  Today, to the Government, the value  of  this\r\n\r\nlegislature  is  only  to the extent  that  it  will\r\n\r\nenable  them  to make unfair laws. Today,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is seeking to bring about a police  State\r\n\r\nwhere the people will be denied the right to express\r\n\r\ntheir  legitimate grievances, where the people  will\r\n\r\nbe  denied  their basic right to organise themselves\r\n\r\nagainst  traitors.  Sir, this  is  not  the  way  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  We are at the moment seeing a systematic\r\n\r\nsuppression of popular expression of discontent. The\r\n\r\npeople  must  be  given peaceful and  constitutional\r\n\r\navenues of expression. This is being denied today by\r\n\r\nan  unfair  Government even to Opposition  political\r\n\r\nParties.  As  I  briefly mentioned earlier  on,  the\r\n\r\nCouncil of Joint Action was denied the right to hold\r\n\r\na  convention.  The parliamentary democratic  system\r\n\r\nwhich the P.A.P. leaders profess to defend is at the\r\n\r\ncross-roads  today.  The  people  have  watched  the\r\n\r\nsystem  being abused, and the P.A.P. leaders are  to\r\n\r\nblame themselves for this exposure of the system. It\r\n\r\nis  not  the people they call Communists.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\ndamage  done  already  is  considerable.  From   now\r\n\r\nonwards,  the people will be more vigilant  and  any\r\n\r\nfurther abuse will necessarily result in our  people\r\n\r\nlosing  all  faith  in  this  system,  and  in   all\r\n\r\nconstitutional means of expressing their  grievances\r\n\r\nand  by  necessity, they may turn to  other  perhaps\r\n\r\nmore painful means of expressing themselves. If such\r\n\r\na  development takes place, the P.A.P. will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  responsible. Today, Sir, there is no fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference  between the S.P.A., which also  help  to\r\n\r\nshow  the  abuse  that can be use  made  of  of  the\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democratic  system,  and  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  fundamental  difference  between  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  and the P.A.P.  Government  of\r\n\r\ntoday.  Sir, it is very clear now to everybody  that\r\n\r\nthey  both  say the same things, they  do  the  same\r\n\r\nthings and they vote\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  same way. The Prime Minister, Sir, at one  time\r\n\r\ndenounced  the  undemocratic acts  of  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment. But today, he indulges in the  same  act\r\n\r\nof denying our people civil liberties - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And much worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> And much worse, and this time he gets the\r\n\r\nactive support of the people that he denounced prior\r\n\r\nto  1959,  the S.P.A., and he gets this  support  in\r\n\r\nthis  very  House. The very political  life  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  depends on the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A., the people who were denounced by the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nthen  as  a reactionary anti-democratic force.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P.  Government  today  survives  with  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the S.P.A. which was already rejected  by\r\n\r\nthe people in 1959 for its anti-democratic acts, and\r\n\r\nit  is only a matter of time before the people  give\r\n\r\ntheir  verdict on the P.A.P. Today, Sir,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's difference with the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nis  not  in  the  principle of  arresting  political\r\n\r\nopponents without trial. But the difference is  only\r\n\r\nin  the  timing  of the arrest and the circumstances\r\n\r\nunder  which  the arrest should be made.  Sir,  only\r\n\r\nrecently the position was different in that he  used\r\n\r\nto  tell  us that the Tunku would know how  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith naughty boys - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is true, you know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But today he further shifted and\r\n\r\nindicated his stand along different lines - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No. Do not -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I do not have the quotes with me.\r\n\r\nBut  if the Prime Minister likes them, I shall  look\r\n\r\nthem up - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Please do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> - and bring them to the attention of this\r\n\r\nHouse.

There  is  no  fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference.

This does not mean, as the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  in the habit of saying,  that  we  are\r\n\r\nafraid.  On democracy there is only one authority  I\r\n\r\ncan quote, and that is the Prime Minister himself. I\r\n\r\njust want to quote two very brief passages. It is in\r\n\r\ncol.  726, Hansard, Vol. 1, of 21st September, 1955.\r\n\r\nSir, today  we are told that all these undemocratic\r\n\r\nacts  are necessary to fight the Communists  and  to\r\n\r\nfight   his   political  opponents  who  are   anti-democratic. Sir, I quote from col. 726:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we are to survive as a free democracy, then we\r\n\r\nmust  be prepared, in principle, to concede  to  our\r\n\r\nenemies - even  those  who do  not  subscribe  to  our\r\n\r\nviews - as  much constitutional right as  you  concede\r\n\r\nyourself.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of this motion, they hold\r\n\r\nmeetings of trade union representatives at which the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister propagates Malaysia. But trade unions\r\n\r\nwhich  do not subscribe to that, which refuse to  be\r\n\r\ntools  of  the  P.A.P.,  are  not  allowed  to  hold\r\n\r\nmeetings  to  discuss  matters  that  affect   their\r\n\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one other short quotation of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  in  col. 831 of 12th October, 1955.  These\r\n\r\nwere   the   days  when  he  was  a  different   man\r\n\r\naltogether:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If we believe in freedom, then we must concede\r\n\r\nthat same freedom even to those who do not honour it\r\n\r\nin  the  way  we do. Further, if we want freedom  to\r\n\r\nsurvive in this part of the world, then we must live\r\n\r\nit  and not just talk it. If you want the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to fight for democracy and freedom, it  is\r\n\r\nno  use telling them. \"Ah but one day we shall  have\r\n\r\nthis freedom, when we have destroyed Communism, when\r\n\r\nwe  have  destroyed the P.A.P.,  and  when  we  have\r\n\r\ndestroyed any force which threatens to bring about a\r\n\r\nsocial revolution.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, here the P.A.P. means the P.A.P. of 1955 and\r\n\r\nnot the P.A.P. of the present day. Those are the two\r\n\r\nquotations  of our Prime Minister who claims  to  be\r\n\r\nthe only man who can save democracy - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We never said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b>- and parliamentary democracy in this\r\n\r\npart  of the world. I am glad he says he never  did,\r\n\r\nand if he never did, and he does not believe that he\r\n\r\nis  the  only champion, then let him at  least  help\r\n\r\nothers  who believe that democracy can only tick  if\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople are given participation in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister has forgotten his earlier\r\n\r\npronouncements. This clearly indicates that  he  has\r\n\r\nchanged  his views and his beliefs. I must say  that\r\n\r\nall  traitors  will sooner or later settle  accounts\r\n\r\nwith the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the legal aspects under the Minor Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  the Societies Ordinance and  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainment  Ordinance are clear. But  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas also threatened the unions with the Trade Unions\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  The unions have been told  that  holding\r\n\r\ndiscussions  on the Referendum Bill is  inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith  the objects of a trade union. We are asked  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that civil rights are matters  of  interest\r\n\r\nonly  to  organisations like the United  Nations.  I\r\n\r\nshall  quote again the Government statement on this.\r\n\r\nThis is a statement of the Government issued on  the\r\n\r\n9th of June and published on the 10th of June in the\r\n\r\nSunday Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"It is the view of the Government that the\r\n\r\nprotection of civil rights is within the province of\r\n\r\norganisations    such   as   the   United    Nations\r\n\r\nAssociations  and not of trade unions and  societies\r\n\r\nconstituted  and  recognised for entirely  different\r\n\r\npurposes,\".'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are seriously asked to believe by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that  civil liberties are  matters  that\r\n\r\nonly  concern organisations like the United  Nations\r\n\r\nAssociations. The trade unions have been  threatened\r\n\r\nthat  their registrations will be cancelled if  they\r\n\r\ncarry  on activities of this nature. The P.A.P.,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   now   says  that  protesting   against   the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill  is politics. We believe  that  the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill affects every aspect of our people's\r\n\r\nlife.  We maintain that the Fascist features of  the\r\n\r\nBill are matters infringing the civic rights of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens and workers. More than 90 per cent  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation  are  composed  of  workers   and   their\r\n\r\ndependants.  It  is the business of the  unions  who\r\n\r\nrepresent the workers to safeguard the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe workers in every respect. In the constitution of\r\n\r\nalmost  all  the  trade unions, the object  is  very\r\n\r\nwidely  stated as generally to promote the material,\r\n\r\nsocial and educational welfare of the members in any\r\n\r\nlawful manner as the union may deem necessary. I  am\r\n\r\nadvised that the legal opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  the  definition of this object is such  that  it\r\n\r\nincludes  a  variety of things; it includes  matters\r\n\r\nthat affect the workers, whether in their industrial\r\n\r\nrelations or in their intercourse in society. I must\r\n\r\nsay here that not only trade unions that are branded\r\n\r\nas  Communist  front organisations, but  also  other\r\n\r\norganisations  like  the  University  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union,  the University Law  Society,  the\r\n\r\nMedical  and  Dental  Surgeons Union,  the  National\r\n\r\nJournalists Union, have all expressed their contempt\r\n\r\nfor  the  undemocratic features  of  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.  Sir,  the Government's reply to the  students\r\n\r\nwas   to   publicly  ridicule  them.  This  is   the\r\n\r\nreflection  of the respect the P.A.P. has  for  the\r\n\r\nviews  of  our people, be they students or  workers.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. has, in fact, stirred up a hornet's nest\r\n\r\nand  is  now trying desperately to cover it up  with\r\n\r\nrepressive  measures. People are not  going  to  let\r\n\r\nthem get away with it so easily. It is silly for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to chide the University students. Let  us\r\n\r\ngive  them more credit for their intelligence.  They\r\n\r\nare  not children. They are grown-ups. Let us remind\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister who, in fact, himself at a  talk\r\n\r\ngiven to the Polytechnic students sometime back said\r\n\r\nthat  in  Asia  it  is the young  that  decides  the\r\n\r\ndestiny of a country. Perhaps he has also forgotten - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He has forgotten this also. But, Sir,\r\n\r\neven  if  we  were  to  assume that  discussing  the\r\n\r\nFascist undemocratic aspects of the Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nis  taking  part in politics, even  if  we  were  to\r\n\r\nconcede  this  point, let me quote what  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders said about trade unions and politics. Let me\r\n\r\nquote  the Prime Minister first. I refer to col.  60\r\n\r\nof Vol. 1, of Hansard, 27th April, 1955:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Next, may I, after being somewhat uncomplimentary\r\n\r\non   the   Emergency  Regulations, compliment   his\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour for the prompt  assertion  and\r\n\r\ncategorical  statement that trade unions  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  take  part  in  politics?  Some   other\r\n\r\ngentleman who thought trade unions should  not  take\r\n\r\npart  in  politics but should form organizations  as\r\n\r\nthey  do  in America has now been put into premature\r\n\r\nretirement and I think that is just as well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  himself  and  for the public  which  he  never\r\n\r\nserved.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the Prime Minister. Let me quote a few\r\n\r\nmore examples of the P.A.P. thinking on trade unions\r\n\r\nand   politics.   Let  me  quote  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Culture in col. 450 of\r\n\r\nHansard, Vol. 11, No. 7 of 13th August, 1959:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Sir, previously it was a popular thing for trade\r\n\r\nunion  leaders to say that trade unions should  keep\r\n\r\naway  from  polities. But the workers never  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  believed that unions could be kept  away  from\r\n\r\npolitics.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote the Member for River Valley in col.\r\n\r\n465, of Vol. 11 again:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the past, trade union leaders have always been\r\n\r\nwarned to keep away from politics. But genuine trade\r\n\r\nunion leaders,-'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>mark the words, Sir, \"genuine trade union leaders\" - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`from their own experience, know that sometime or\r\n\r\nother  they  have to seek the support of politicians\r\n\r\nto achieve results. Those leaders who do not believe\r\n\r\nthat  politics  is  part of trade  unionism  usually\r\n\r\nperish.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That came from the Member for River Valley. And  let\r\n\r\nme  quote,  Sir, the Prime Minister's  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary - in col. 467:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Member for the Southern Islands has advised\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Labour and Law to exercise care  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  labour movement will not be  involved  in\r\n\r\npolities.  I  wonder, because, if  one  follows  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement or political developments closely, I\r\n\r\nthink the one cannot be separated from the other.  I\r\n\r\nthink the labour movement must be closely related to\r\n\r\npolitical developments because, if any action by the\r\n\r\nlabour  movement  fails,  then  they  will  have  no\r\n\r\nalternative   but   to   fight   through   political\r\n\r\nchannels.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And,  Sir, if one were to have the time to sit  down\r\n\r\nand  read  the  Hansard, he can  find  more  quotes.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, all this talk of trade unions  being\r\n\r\ntold  that  civil liberties are matters of  interest\r\n\r\nonly  to  the United Nations is nothing but a  bluff\r\n\r\ndeliberately made to try and mislead the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the P.A.P. has conceded that the\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill is not democratic, but has tried  to\r\n\r\njustify  this  by  saying  that  these  undemocratic\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  the Bill are necessary  to  fight  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  Sir,  I have already  quoted  what  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister's  views were on  theories  of  this\r\n\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders are probably aware\r\n\r\nthemselves  that many of their acts are contrary  to\r\n\r\ndemocratic  practice. But they try to justify  their\r\n\r\nactions  by saying that this is how one should  deal\r\n\r\nwith  the Communists. Sir, the Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas  expressed his theory that one must on  occasion\r\n\r\ndepart  from  democracy in order to  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nCommunists. Sir, I must remind the House  that  this\r\n\r\nis  exactly  what  Hitler did. As we  know,  Germany\r\n\r\nended up with a Fascist regime under the Nazis  with\r\n\r\nso-called National Socialism led by Hitler  himself.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a curious thing - National Socialist.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  National  Socialists  in  Great  Britain  today\r\n\r\nopenly  preach Fascism. I am grateful to the  Sunday\r\n\r\nMail   for   having  published  a  very  interesting\r\n\r\narticle,  and  if you have noted it  carefully,  the\r\n\r\nSunday  Mail also carried a picture of the  National\r\n\r\nSocialist  symbol which very closely  resembles  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Which you were proud of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> I must say, Mr Speaker, Sir, I was not\r\n\r\none of them who decided whether we wanted the symbol\r\n\r\nor not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today the P.A.P. leadership in Singapore claim\r\n\r\nto  be  national  Socialists and  practise  Fascism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it  would not be out of place,  as  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  stated  that  even the  national  socialist\r\n\r\nmovement in other parts of the world, one way or the\r\n\r\nother,   preaches  Fascism.  Sir,   today   we   are\r\n\r\nwitnessing   in  Singapore  McCarthyism.   This   is\r\n\r\nprecisely  the  bankrupt  philosophy  of  the  anti-Communists.  We  saw it once before being  put  into\r\n\r\npractice by the Lim Yew Hock Government and  we  all\r\n\r\nknow what has become of the Member for Cairnhill and\r\n\r\nhis very close colleague, Mr Chew Swee Kee. Sir, if\r\n\r\nthe past is any indication of the future, then it is\r\n\r\nsafe  to assume that the Prime Minister perhaps will\r\n\r\nend  up as a tin miner in some remote corner of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  provided,  of  course,   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government will accommodate him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, anti-Communism is a negative philosophy and\r\n\r\nour  Prime  Minister himself has said this  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse many times. The P.A.P. has been forced by  the\r\n\r\npersonal ambitions of some of its leaders  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  become a reactionary force. As the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Bras  Basah  said  recently,  the  P.A.P. has\r\n\r\ndeparted  from  its  original  aim  of  building   a\r\n\r\nsocialist  Malaya. Now the P.A.P. leaders know  that\r\n\r\ntheir  actions are undemocratic. But they still  try\r\n\r\nto stifle public opinion. Because the P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nare  afraid,  they  are taking repressive  measures.\r\n\r\nThis is the tragedy of renegades. When bogus working\r\n\r\nclass  leaders  realise  that  they  have  lost  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the people through their own folly,  they\r\n\r\nindulge in repression. As the days go by they become\r\n\r\nmore  desperate because they feel the anger  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  mounting and so they have a number of police\r\n\r\nescorts day and night to protect themselves from the\r\n\r\npeople.  Sir,  the more desperate they  become,  the\r\n\r\nmore  repressive  they  are in  their  actions.  The\r\n\r\ndegree  of  desperation  is  an  indication  of  the\r\n\r\nmeasure  of their weakness. It is also, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir,   an   indication  of  the  strength   of   the\r\n\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. leaders are politically bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAfter  the  life of this Assembly, with  or  without\r\n\r\nmerger, the P.A.P. will disintegrate. There will be\r\n\r\nno  more spoils. Some of the leaders may attempt  to\r\n\r\nset  up iron or tin mines, if with nothing else,  at\r\n\r\nleast  with P.A.P. funds which have been accumulated\r\n\r\nfrom  contributes  from P.A.P. Assemblymen  for  the\r\n\r\nlast three years. I am told, Sir, that they have  in\r\n\r\nthe kitty something like half a million dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

If the government  of\r\n\r\nthe  day  cannot  give the people  their  basic  and\r\n\r\nfundamental  rights  for free  expression  and  free\r\n\r\nassociation, then the consequences will be that  the\r\n\r\npeople will lose faith in the democratic system.

I do not think  we\r\n\r\nshall see again for a very long time the events that\r\n\r\nare  taking place. I was only commenting  the  other\r\n\r\nday   to  the  Member  for  Thomson:  how  different\r\n\r\neverybody  wants  to appear from  his  normal  role.\r\n\r\nEverybody  wants  to look something  different  from\r\n\r\nwhat he actually is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Thought projection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Sir. Physical evidence.\r\n\r\nOnly the other day his Secretary-General, who was  a\r\n\r\ngreat    representative   of   the   workers,    the\r\n\r\nproletariat, came to the C.P.A. Room with  a  polka-dotted  silken  scarf and a coat, looking  something\r\n\r\nquite  different.

What are they?  Rural  dwellers  are\r\n\r\npeasants.  It is the combination of the workers  and\r\n\r\nthe  peasants  that brought about the revolution  in\r\n\r\nChina.

True, Sir, these\r\n\r\nare  words  of extravagance. What are the facts?  On\r\n\r\nthe  9th June a meeting was planned at the Shop  and\r\n\r\nFactory  Workers Union, 4th branch, Bukit  Timah.  I\r\n\r\nknow the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npremises well and so does the Member for Thomson. In\r\n\r\nfact, I used to look after those premises since  the\r\n\r\nowner  went back to China, one Mr Lim Chin Kok.  He\r\n\r\nwas  the nominal owner. Now the unions are not  even\r\n\r\npaying  rent. One of these days the Public  Trustee,\r\n\r\non behalf of the owner, will have to enforce payment\r\n\r\nof  rent.  These are things which will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nsettled.   These  are  proper  accounts,   financial\r\n\r\naccounts, and will have to be settled. That was  the\r\n\r\nscene  where  the actual combat took place.  I  went\r\n\r\ninto  those  premises immediately after  the  combat\r\n\r\ntook  place  to  try and salvage the  property  that\r\n\r\nbelonged to the members of the union. There was real\r\n\r\ncombat - broken glass, broken windows, 300-odd  chaps\r\n\r\nstaged  a last-ditch stand against tear gas,  broken\r\n\r\nbricks,  glass,  mortar, cupboards, tables.  200-odd\r\n\r\npeople  were  sent  to  gaol for  that  incident  in\r\n\r\nOctober.  That was real combat. That took  place  in\r\n\r\n1956,  six years ago. The Member for Thomson is  not\r\n\r\nunaware. He once entered the premises with me  while\r\n\r\nthe tear gas was still strong in the premises. Maybe\r\n\r\nhe has forgotten it. That place has history. That is\r\n\r\nwhy they went back to the 4th branch at Bukit Timah.\r\n\r\nTo revive old memories. Commemorate old events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> You had your meetings there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Five-one-three: what the\r\n\r\nChinese  call \"Wu I-san\". The Chinese, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nhave  got a good mnemonic system to help the memory.\r\n\r\nFive-one-three,  and it evokes Five  for  May,  one-three  for 13. There were innocent students at  King\r\n\r\nGeorge  V  Park being beaten up by brutal policemen.\r\n\r\nThis incident that took place in the 4th Branch  was\r\n\r\nfollowing on 9:1:8. 9:1:8 was the 18th of September,\r\n\r\n1956,   when  the  purge  started.  That   was   the\r\n\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, what happened this time? They were going\r\n\r\nto  reform  a front organisation. I knew  the  Human\r\n\r\nRights  Convention  well. I watched  it  with  great\r\n\r\ninterest   and   I  saw  it  being  perverted   with\r\n\r\nconsiderable effectiveness. The same group of  chaps\r\n\r\nappeared  under different guises each time  -  Jamit\r\n\r\nSingh, Harbour Board Staff Association, turns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  as  Chairman or Committee member of Human Rights\r\n\r\nConvention.  The  same  group  of  chaps,  the  same\r\n\r\nhandful  of  people running around  under  different\r\n\r\nnames  and  aliases,  and giving  an  impression  of\r\n\r\nmassive solidarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, we decided that history is not only\r\n\r\nunlikely  to repeat itself as in 1955-1956,  but  we\r\n\r\nwill ensure that it does not repeat itself, and that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be none of this formation  of  Peasants\r\n\r\nWorkers  National Bourgeoisie Alliance, all  in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Communist Party. Let each union carry on\r\n\r\nits  work;  let  each  society discuss  whatever  it\r\n\r\nwants,  even if it is Communist-dominated,  for  the\r\n\r\ntime  being.  So be it. But let them not  seek  more\r\n\r\ntrouble  for  the  community by ganging  up.  So  we\r\n\r\npointed  out  to  them what the law  was  in  polite\r\n\r\nlanguage, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will read out  to  you\r\n\r\nthe  letter of the 9th of June: The Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  was informed on the 8th of June that  there\r\n\r\nwas  going  to be a meeting on the 9th  of  June.  A\r\n\r\ndecision  had to be taken whether or not  a  meeting\r\n\r\nwhich was known to be illegal was allowed to go  on.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a meeting to have a cup of tea,  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate  a  wedding  or  to  enjoy  music  - Johann\r\n\r\nStrauss  or  Bach.  This was  the  beginning  of  an\r\n\r\nadventure, of a campaign, a convention. You  do  not\r\n\r\ncome   together  to  celebrate  a   wedding   at   a\r\n\r\nconvention.   Conventions  are  meant  for   certain\r\n\r\nspecific  purposes over a period of  time,  and  the\r\n\r\nsame  men - I will read the details which are better\r\n\r\nknown to my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs - first   formed   this  convention   and   collected\r\n\r\nthemselves  together  as a Committee  of  Eleven  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate  May Day. Then they reformed, changed  the\r\n\r\nname,   carried  on  the  Association  to  celebrate\r\n\r\nNational  Day. Then they carried on.  Now  they  say\r\n\r\n\"Campaign   against  Referendum\".  Campaign   merely\r\n\r\nagainst merger - that is what it is all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, this was the letter written by what the\r\n\r\nMember  for Thomson calls a \"Fascist Police  Force\".\r\n\r\n\"Dear   Sir,\"   it  begins,  and  ends   up   \"Yours\r\n\r\nfaithfully,\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It has come to my notice that you and certain\r\n\r\nother person calling ourselves the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\nSingapore   Trade  Unions  Working  Committee   have\r\n\r\norganised  a  public assembly  to  be  held  in  the\r\n\r\npremises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees'\r\n\r\nUnion. 87 Bukit Timah Road, at 7.30 p.m. on the  9th\r\n\r\nof  June, 1962.

There were no riot squads, no riot\r\n\r\nvans, no beating of heads. That is not the way  this\r\n\r\nGovernment governs. We do not believe in a  show  of\r\n\r\nforce.  We do not think it is necessary. We  believe\r\n\r\nit  is  easier  to  play the game according  to  the\r\n\r\nrules. If they by-pass the rules, so be it. But  let\r\n\r\nus  inform  them of the rules. They need  a  permit.\r\n\r\nThey  have  not  a  permit.  We  inform  them.  They\r\n\r\ndisperse. Then they issue truculent statements.  Let\r\n\r\nme   just  quote  you  passages  of  this  truculent\r\n\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The fascist hand of the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nshowed  itself more clearly once mote when it barred\r\n\r\nthe holding of a meeting to discuss the grave threat\r\n\r\nto  democracy  that  is embodied in  the  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A threat to democracy, Sir? What are we talking\r\n\r\nabout?  A  Bill for which we allowed from its  first\r\n\r\nintroduction in January - seven months of  gestation.\r\n\r\nAmendments   we   moved   to   counter   their   own\r\n\r\nunprecedented,  evil-intended amendments.  We  never\r\n\r\ndid anything undemocratic in that Bill, contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe   Constitution.   Nobody   is   prevented   from\r\n\r\nexpressing what he wishes in any referendum, but  we\r\n\r\nare  making  it unprofitable for them to do  foolish\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they dispersed. Meanwhile, they issued\r\n\r\nprovocative  statements:  \"We  want   to   see   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police. We demand an  explanation.\"\r\n\r\nWell,  Sir,  authority is always open  to  challenge\r\n\r\n- and  in  a  democratic society with an  independent\r\n\r\njudiciary, which even the Member for Anson  has  not\r\n\r\ndared  allege to be otherwise than independent - there\r\n\r\nare  ways  and  means of challenging authority.  But\r\n\r\ntruculent statements demanding interviews  with  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Police. Is that the  constitutional\r\n\r\nway out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Commissioner, on the instructions of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, was told to be polite.  So  he  wrote\r\n\r\nthem  a  letter. On the 14th of June he  said  in  a\r\n\r\nletter:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would assure you that I have obtained legal\r\n\r\nadvice  on this matter. I am advised that addresses,\r\n\r\ndebates  and discussions at any place in  which  the\r\n\r\npublic  or any class of the public has access  would\r\n\r\ncome within the definition of \"public entertainment\"\r\n\r\nin  the  Public Entertainments Ordinance, 1958.  The\r\n\r\nexception  in  respect  of  meetings  of  registered\r\n\r\nsocieties  and registered trade unions only  applies\r\n\r\nwhere  persons who are not members are excluded.  In\r\n\r\nmy  opinion, therefore, a licence under  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance, 1958, is required, and  if\r\n\r\nno such licence is obtained, the Police will have to\r\n\r\ntake   action  under  the  powers  given   in   that\r\n\r\nOrdinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on in paragraph 5 to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But if the persons who attend the proposed meeting\r\n\r\nconstitute themselves into an association of ten  or\r\n\r\nmore   persons,   they   would  constitute,   unless\r\n\r\nregistered, an unlawful society, and action  may  be\r\n\r\ntaken under the Societies Ordinance. Any society  or\r\n\r\ntrade  union which attends the meeting or sends  its\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  will be subject to  the  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations  relating to the society or trade  union\r\n\r\nand  to  the over-riding provisions of the Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and the Trade Unions Ordinance.  Where  a\r\n\r\nsociety  is used for purposes incompatible with  the\r\n\r\nobjects or rules of the society, action may be taken\r\n\r\nagainst the society under the Societies Ordinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Similarly a trade union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, Sir. They were then called up by the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Societies, by  which  time  they  had\r\n\r\ndiscovered  that their Committee of  Eleven  was  an\r\n\r\nunlawful  association. They had written  in  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  to  say  that they were  a  Committee  of\r\n\r\nEleven Trade Unions Working Committee, so-and-so was\r\n\r\nthe  President,  so-and-so was  the  Secretary,  and\r\n\r\nthese were their objects. But now they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiscarded two Committee members: saying from  eleven\r\n\r\nthey were now nine. The Member for Thomson said  now\r\n\r\nthey were within the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they decided to go on with it on the 16th, and\r\n\r\nthis  was after the letter had been sent to them  on\r\n\r\nthe  14th. On the 15th we got information that  they\r\n\r\nwere  going to go on with the meeting regardless  of\r\n\r\nthe consequences. So on the 16th we decided that the\r\n\r\npoint  at  issue  must be taken, namely  association\r\n\r\nitself.  There  were  many  contraventions  of  many\r\n\r\nOrdinances - the Public Entertainments Ordinance, the\r\n\r\nMinor  Offences Ordinance, and so on  - that  require\r\n\r\npenalties;  this,  that  and  the  other.  But   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  decided, after discussion, that the  point\r\n\r\nat  issue must be taken, because the thing was going\r\n\r\nto  repeat  itself. If they could not  succeed  this\r\n\r\nway, they were going to try some other way. And  the\r\n\r\npoint at issue is association for purposes which  we\r\n\r\nconsider incompatible with good law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter was sent on the 16th:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I refer to the report in today's Straits Times of\r\n\r\na proposed meeting of delegates from 40 trade unions\r\n\r\nto be held tonight at 7.30 under the auspices of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Trade Unions Working Committee,  of  which\r\n\r\nyou are Chairman. I would refer to our interview  in\r\n\r\nmy  office on the 15th of June, 1962, with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  activities of your Committee, when you informed\r\n\r\nme  that  the membership of your Committee had  been\r\n\r\nreduced from eleven to nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear from the report of the proposal to\r\n\r\nhold   tonight's  meeting  that  you  are  under   a\r\n\r\nmisapprehension as to the law.

Sir, the photograph shows the\r\n\r\nSecretary of this Convention - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister tabled a copy of the photograph and handed copies to Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The Ministry of Culture is\r\n\r\nquite in the open. All the Press were there. If\r\n\r\nthere were any broken heads, broken glasses, they\r\n\r\nwould have seen it. This was the 16th at 7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nThere was Mr Ghouse, the Secretary. Now who is the\r\n\r\naggressor there, Sir? The man he was talking to was\r\n\r\na police officer, representing the Registrar of\r\n\r\nSocieties, who was asked to execute his duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we wanted to be difficult, Mr Ghouse\r\n\r\nshould  be  in  for  an offence for  intimidating  a\r\n\r\npolice   officer,   using  violent   and   truculent\r\n\r\nlanguage.  I  do  not think there is  any  point  or\r\n\r\npurpose  in  my  going  to  answer  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson's allegations - they are futile and  tedious.\r\n\r\nThey  want to make out of this Government the  image\r\n\r\nthat  they were able to make of the last Government.\r\n\r\nBut  we have the advantage of having seen how it was\r\n\r\ndone  the  last  time, why it was wrong,  where  the\r\n\r\nmistakes were made, and we do not intend that  these\r\n\r\nmistakes   be   repeated.  Therefore,  when   police\r\n\r\nofficers go down, they are given strict instructions\r\n\r\n- to be polite, always firm but always polite, always\r\n\r\nwithin  the law. I would say, if there is any doubt,\r\n\r\nI  have  a whole series of photographs - a record  of\r\n\r\nthe  events that evening that will leave  nobody  in\r\n\r\nany  doubt  as to who was the violent and aggressive\r\n\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just read out some of the incidents that\r\n\r\ntook  place - this was the 16th. This was  between  7\r\n\r\nand 8.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\nattended   together   with   Ministry   of   Culture\r\n\r\nphotographers. Then Mr Ho Piau - I know Mr Ho  Piau,\r\n\r\nSir,  he  is not a friend of mine, but I have  known\r\n\r\nhim  for a long time - a very hot tempered young man,\r\n\r\nexcusable   because  he  is  not  mature,   a   very\r\n\r\naggressive chap. He wants to impress the world  that\r\n\r\nhe  is a great fighter for human rights and workers'\r\n\r\nrights  and on with the revolution. Well  he  turned\r\n\r\nup,  very aggressive, and he was given a copy of the\r\n\r\nletter. He raised his voice and said, \"I don't  want\r\n\r\nthe letter,\" The police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nofficer  explained to hint that it was only for  his\r\n\r\nown good that he should read the letter. He refused.\r\n\r\nThen Mr Dominic Puthucheary came on the scene. Sir,\r\n\r\nhe  is  another young man - a brash young  man - and  he\r\n\r\nwants  to prove to the world and to himself that  he\r\n\r\nis  a brave man. He stood with me and the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  and said, \"What now?\" Hands  on  hips,\r\n\r\ngesticulating  while he was pointing his  finger  at\r\n\r\nme,  nearly thumping me on the chest. And  this  was\r\n\r\nthe  way he behaved to the police officer. He  said,\r\n\r\n\"The  Police  should not force the  letters  on  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives.\" The officer told him that they not\r\n\r\nforcing  letters on the representatives.  They  were\r\n\r\nonly doing their duty by letting, those who went  in\r\n\r\nknow  that  they  were going to  participate  in  an\r\n\r\nillegal meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Dominic Puthucheary closed the iron gate, and\r\n\r\nasked  for  the representative of the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nSocieties to come in. Now, Sir, who is the aggressor\r\n\r\nin all this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The representative of the Registrar of Societies\r\n\r\nhad  been given strict instructions not to allow any\r\n\r\nincidents  to  be construed as provocation.  He  had\r\n\r\ndone his duty and informed everybody present of  the\r\n\r\nposition  by  distributing  these  letters  in   all\r\n\r\nlanguages  for the convenience of those  who  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  friends  do  the  translation  for  them.  The\r\n\r\nletters were distributed in all languages. They then\r\n\r\nmet and they called off the meeting, quite sensibly,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir.  The whole  procedure  had  been\r\n\r\nobserved.  Everybody had been properly  informed  of\r\n\r\nthe position. Had they proceeded, the law would have\r\n\r\ntaken  its course. So they decided that they  should\r\n\r\nabide by the law. But not till they had gone to  see\r\n\r\na lawyer and he had written his learned opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to be my own lawyer, and I would\r\n\r\nlike  to read only one passage of the comments  from\r\n\r\nthe S.A.G.'s Chambers on this lawyer's letter. I  do\r\n\r\nnot want to bore the House. I think I will just read\r\n\r\ntwo   short  paragraphs  which  will  set  out   the\r\n\r\nabsurdity of the proposition which the Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee have put to this lawyer. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  it  was  for a  fee,  but  obviously,\r\n\r\naccording  to the explanatory note, the accompanying\r\n\r\nadvice must have been a professional piece of  work.\r\n\r\nAnd  on the advice and the instructions of the facts\r\n\r\nfrom his clients, he gave this advice,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  this is what the Government's Legal Department,\r\n\r\nthe S.A.G.'s Chambers, had to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`One does not usually come across a committee\r\n\r\nwithout  some  form of organisation  for  which  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  is  responsible. The word \"committee\"  is\r\n\r\ndefined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as \"a  body\r\n\r\nof  persons  appointed or elected for  some  special\r\n\r\nbusiness or function\"'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Trade Unions Working Committee; Hussein\r\n\r\nJahidin,  President;  Mr  Ghouse,  Secretary.  Both\r\n\r\ngentlemen  are  known to me, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  Mr\r\n\r\nGhouse is particularly, I think, known to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Joo  Chiat.  Sir, if such a  committee  invites\r\n\r\ndelegates  from 40 unions or a hundred  associations\r\n\r\nto attend a meeting or convention to protest against\r\n\r\nthis,  that or the other, and continues to  meet  as\r\n\r\nsuch, what else is the body of persons attending it,\r\n\r\nexcept an association of more than ten persons,  for\r\n\r\nthat object? The point may be technical, but it is a\r\n\r\nvalid  point  in  law. Guests at a tea  party  or  a\r\n\r\nmusical recital are a different kettle of fish. That\r\n\r\nis,  if  they really were not foregathered to admire\r\n\r\nfolk  dancing - genuine  old  Chinese  classical  folk\r\n\r\ndancing, an exposition of the Chinese guitar  or  of\r\n\r\nthe flute - that is a different kettle of fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They usually meet on one occasion only. The team\r\n\r\nvaries  from time to time. Invitees need not attend.\r\n\r\nTheir common purpose is a social one and the thought\r\n\r\ninvolved is the pursuit of an object as used in  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"society\". They sip their tea;  listen\r\n\r\nor  not to music or speeches, as they think fit, and\r\n\r\nthey  do  not indulge in debates or pass resolutions\r\n\r\nfor  or  against  any common course  of  action.  De\r\n\r\nminimis  non  curat lex. My Latin  has  always  been\r\n\r\nweak,   Mr  Speaker  Sir,  and  needs  a   bit   of\r\n\r\ntranslation. It says, according to the lexicon, \"the\r\n\r\nlaw cares not for trifles of that nature\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting of delegates of 40 unions or a hundred or\r\n\r\nmore  sponsoring bodies with a sponsoring  committee\r\n\r\nis,  in  my  opinion,  over the borderline  dividing\r\n\r\ntrifles   from   ponderables  into  the   realm   of\r\n\r\n\"association\".  I am unable to see  the  analogy  of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives at a Press conference. The latter is\r\n\r\na meeting of persons who do not always know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none   another  and  each  Press  representative   is\r\n\r\nentirely  on  his  own pursuing the  policy  of  his\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  He does not particularly care  what  his\r\n\r\nrival  thinks. His interests lie only  in  what  the\r\n\r\nV.I.P. concerned thinks. Nor is there any committee\r\n\r\nof any kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the legal position. I say it is quite\r\n\r\nsimple.   There  are  constitutional   methods   for\r\n\r\nestablishing  the position. There  are  people  with\r\n\r\nmany  friends  in the law. The Trade Unions  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee  there  is  also  this  Council  of  Joint\r\n\r\nAction,  I see now, strong enough to take  over  the\r\n\r\nwork  of this Trade Unions Working Committee. It  is\r\n\r\nthe  same  idea. You cannot revive the Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee.  Even the  Lib-Socs.  too.  They\r\n\r\nsuffered - it does not matter. I mean it is a  little\r\n\r\nawkward and embarrassing to have to use labels which\r\n\r\nyou  once  condemned as reactionary,  wicked,  vile,\r\n\r\ndiscarded  by  the people; but whatever  the  people\r\n\r\ndiscard,  the Communists never hesitate to use.  And\r\n\r\nso this Council of Joint Action - all their boys, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir. Nobody in his right mind watching  the\r\n\r\nproceedings   will  not  know  and  will   not   but\r\n\r\nacknowledge  it. Party Rakyat - it is  the  same  old\r\n\r\ngang.  The  Barisan Sosialis, the Party Rakyat,  the\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party. The Member for Anson knows full well\r\n\r\nwhat  happened in Kuala Lumpur. It is on the  record\r\n\r\nabout  his Party being captured. It is on the record\r\n\r\npublicly  about what the Minister for Law  has  said\r\n\r\npublicly. [Interruption] Publicly. Well, he has  his\r\n\r\nremedies.  Mr Speaker, if lies are told  about  him\r\n\r\nwhich  bring  him into ridicule and contempt.  As  I\r\n\r\nhave said, these remedies should be pursued. We must\r\n\r\ndo  things constitutionally. A lie cannot be  killed\r\n\r\nby  a  counter lie. A lie has got to be nailed.  And\r\n\r\nthe newly-formed U.P.P. and the Barisan Sosialis - ah,\r\n\r\nsorry -  Lib-Socs. 120 votes in Anson. That will  do.\r\n\r\nIt   does   not  matter.  People  discard  it:   the\r\n\r\nCommunists can use it. Our line is quite simple. Let\r\n\r\nus go strictly according to the rules of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not put off by all these threats that people\r\n\r\nmay  turn to other methods. What other methods? What\r\n\r\nare  these  innuendoes meant for - to frighten  us  in\r\n\r\nthis Chamber?

They\r\n\r\nface an entirely different situation from l955-l956.\r\n\r\nI  welcome  the  Member for Thomson's  interjection,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  clarified the air. Had the matter  just\r\n\r\nrested with your stout defence of the rights of this\r\n\r\nChamber,  not having people throwing imputations  at\r\n\r\neach  other, a lingering suspicion might  remain  in\r\n\r\nthe  mind  of everybody that the P.A.P. has  salted\r\n\r\naway  half  a  million dollars.  Somehow,  there  is\r\n\r\nsomething  shady  about it.

So  did\r\n\r\nlots of other people. We are not going to perish and\r\n\r\nfold up and buy tin mines and vanish. No. We will be\r\n\r\nhere  long after the others have gone. Do not worry.\r\n\r\nI  have  told  Members of the Barisan Sosialis  that\r\n\r\nthey  have got enough on their plate to worry  about\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Never worry about others, because  they\r\n\r\nare  in  no  position to waste their time about  the\r\n\r\ngood  or  bad  fortunes of other people.  They  have\r\n\r\nenough  troubles  coming upon them.  The  wheel  of\r\n\r\nfortune  - Nemesis  is  inevitable.  That  is   their\r\n\r\nproblem.  But  our  problem is this:  to  prevent  a\r\n\r\nrepetition  of  the  events  of  1955-l956,  by  any\r\n\r\nvariation whatsoever. This is a stalemate for  them.\r\n\r\nThey  are not fighting a Government that is corrupt.\r\n\r\nBy  their  own  admission it is not.  They  are  not\r\n\r\nfighting  a  Government that is  ignorant  of  their\r\n\r\ntactics. They are not fighting a Government that  is\r\n\r\nweak  and vacillating. Nobody is going to be reduced\r\n\r\nto  a  whimpering pulp of a man. Nobody - not anybody\r\n\r\non  this side.

We  have  better\r\n\r\nweapons than that. The photographer with his  camera\r\n\r\nis  a  much more valuable defender of democracy than\r\n\r\nthe  soldier or the policeman with a gun. The  radio\r\n\r\nreporter  with  his tape recorder  makes  a  greater\r\n\r\ncontribution to truth than all the mass of lies that\r\n\r\nthey can pour in their weekly diatribe.

I  only hope that all these foolish  things\r\n\r\nthey  say from time to time, as what the Member  for\r\n\r\nThomson  has  said  today  about  turning  to  other\r\n\r\nmethods; the Member for Queenstown shaking his  hand\r\n\r\nwith uncontrollable rage; the Chairman of this Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Working  Committee,  Inche  Hussein  Jahidin,\r\n\r\nsaying  in a Press statement - was it yesterday?  - in\r\n\r\nvirulent   language,  \"If  the  people   face   this\r\n\r\ncontinual  repression, they will turn to other  less\r\n\r\ndemocratic means.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let them apprise themselves of this.

The Prime Minister has not fully replied to\r\n\r\nthe points raised by the Member for Thomson. He said\r\n\r\nthe  Government  is  run  on democratic  lines.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, all of us have said many things  about\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  system and our Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nmentioned the democratic system in practically every\r\n\r\nspeech he has made in this House. I was very pleased\r\n\r\nto hear him saying that the democratic system should\r\n\r\nnot be destroyed. But what are the facts? The people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  should enjoy democratic rights.  Have\r\n\r\nthey  enjoyed  these  rights? In  fact,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  have  not allowed them  to  enjoy  their\r\n\r\ndemocratic rights even under peaceful conditions and\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  allow  the  trade  unions  and  other\r\n\r\norganisations to express their views, is  there  any\r\n\r\nso-called  free  competition  with  other  political\r\n\r\nParties?  They  must  toe the line  of  the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\notherwise they cannot express any views at all.  The\r\n\r\nPrime Minister means that all political Parties  and\r\n\r\norganisations  should toe the  line  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nActually  all  political Parties  and  organisations\r\n\r\nshould be allowed to express their views freely.  We\r\n\r\nhave  a very good example in the Referendum Bill  to\r\n\r\nshow  that  the Government have destroyed  democracy\r\n\r\nand not the unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Prime Minister said that\r\n\r\nthese trade unions wanted to organise a united front\r\n\r\non  the  same  lines as the Civil Rights  Convention\r\n\r\norganised in 1956. We can draw this conclusion  from\r\n\r\nhis speech.

In\r\n\r\n1956,  the  Civil Rights Convention  was  formed  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard the fundamental democratic rights  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  under  the previous Government.  I  remember\r\n\r\nthat  at  that time this Convention held a  one-week\r\n\r\nmeeting  to  protest  against the  Government.  This\r\n\r\nmovement  not only gained support from  the  various\r\n\r\norganisations, unions and from all classes of people\r\n\r\nbut also from the various organisations supported\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Perhaps the Member could step a little\r\n\r\nfurther  back,  because he is  coming  through  very\r\n\r\nloudly.

The  Prime Minister  has  forgotten  a\r\n\r\nlesson   he  has  learned.  In  1956,  he   strongly\r\n\r\ncondemned the Government. At various conventions and\r\n\r\nmeetings,  he spoke out strongly against colonialism\r\n\r\nand  that is why some people took him to be a leader\r\n\r\nwho  would fight for the rights of the masses. As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the Prime Minister's activities in  those\r\n\r\ndays,  he is the Prime Minister of Singapore  today.\r\n\r\nBut  strangely  enough when the Prime  Minister  was\r\n\r\nsitting  on  this  side of the  House  in  1956,  he\r\n\r\nstrongly  condemned the undemocratic  activities  of\r\n\r\nthe  then  Government and today when he  is  sitting\r\n\r\nopposite  on  the Government Bench  he  should  turn\r\n\r\nround to heap abuses on those who helped him in  the\r\n\r\npast  to  become  Prime Minister. I refer  to  those\r\n\r\ntrade  union  leaders and the leaders of  rural  and\r\n\r\ncultural  organisations who are now accused  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister as stooges of the Communists.

The leaders  and\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the various organisations  have\r\n\r\nbeen  elected to discuss various pertinent questions\r\n\r\nand  these organisations have been registered  under\r\n\r\nthe   Trade   Unions  Ordinance  and  the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance. That is why these organisations, which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been properly registered, cannot be accused  of\r\n\r\ncarrying out illegal or subversive activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation given by the Government is merely\r\n\r\nto  hide  their  fear  that  more  people  and  more\r\n\r\norganisations  will  come  forward  to  show   their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  with the National Referendum  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  is merely hoping  to  suppress  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore and to prevent them from  being\r\n\r\nunited  against this undemocratic Bill. That is  why\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  given  by the  Government  can  be\r\n\r\nacceptable  only to the Government Benches  and  the\r\n\r\nS.P.A.  The  people of Singapore - can never  accept\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  given by the Government  and  they\r\n\r\ncannot  approve  the attitude of the Government.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister says that the democratic  system\r\n\r\nexists only by peaceful democratic competition, then\r\n\r\nlet  the Government show that it has this democratic\r\n\r\nattitude  and  put  it into practice,  and  let  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  the full right of free expression  and\r\n\r\nthe right of free assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the motion moved by the Member for\r\n\r\nThomson  should  be accepted by the Government,  and\r\n\r\nthe Government should rectify its past mistakes,  so\r\n\r\nas  to  allow  the  organisations  in  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nexercise  their  democratic right to  express  their\r\n\r\nviews  to the Government. Only in this way  can  you\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  democratic system is operated  under\r\n\r\nfree  and  democratic competition. If the Government\r\n\r\nbelieves  in  this,  then the motion  moved  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Thomson  should  be  accepted  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the importance of\r\n\r\nthis motion is inadequately enunciated, although  it\r\n\r\nfumbles  at  what  it means. The importance  of  the\r\n\r\nmotion  is not in the \"undemocratic actions\"  - there\r\n\r\nhave been many - but it is in the illegal action, the\r\n\r\nunconstitutional action of the Government.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to make my position clear. The Workers'  Party\r\n\r\nwas  invited by this group to the meeting on the 9th\r\n\r\nof  June.

I  trust  this  is  not   a\r\n\r\nrepetition of the Tommy Koh story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I go on then to the important\r\n\r\nconstitutional aspects of the motion before  you?  I\r\n\r\nwish these aspects could have been clarified in  the\r\n\r\nonly  place  which  is really appropriate  for  such\r\n\r\nissues,  that is a court of law, instead of  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical  atmosphere  of  political  bias  in   the\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would draw your attention to the first letter of the Acting Deputy Commissioner,\r\n\r\ndated  the  9th of June. In that one he  tells  them\r\n\r\nthat they have organised a \"public assembly\", and it\r\n\r\nis  exclusively on the ground that it  is  a  public\r\n\r\nassembly  without  a  permit that  he  considers  it\r\n\r\nillegal,  and  consequently  sends  his  police   to\r\n\r\nprevent the commission of an offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public assemblies without licence are made offences\r\n\r\nunder  two  Ordinances. One is  the  Minor  Offences\r\n\r\nOrdinance. There, under the provisions of section  5\r\n\r\nthere have been rules made, rules that are known  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minor Offences Assemblies and Processions Rules\r\n\r\nof  1960, being Supplement No. 28 of the 13th of May\r\n\r\nand gazetted as S 134. Under Rule 2, Sir, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No assembly or procession consisting of five or\r\n\r\nmore persons shall take place in any public road  or\r\n\r\nin  any  public  place, or place of  public  resort,\r\n\r\nexcept  in  accordance with a  permit  issued  under\r\n\r\nthese  rules  and in compliance with the  conditions\r\n\r\nand restrictions endorsed on such permit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You notice, Sir, the words after \"shall take place\r\n\r\nin  any  public road\" - we take it, Sir, there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion  about  this - \"or in any public  place,  or\r\n\r\nplace of public resort\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will turn to section 5 (6) of the Minor\r\n\r\nOffences Ordinance, Chapter 117:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`By amendment of Ordinance 24 of 1959, \"public\r\n\r\nplace\"  is defined as a building, park, garden,  sea\r\n\r\nbeach  or  other place to which the public  for  the\r\n\r\ntime being has access.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not suggested and has not been suggested by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister that the premises  of  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion  are  a place to which the general public  has\r\n\r\naccess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second definition \"place of public resort\",\r\n\r\nmeans  an  approved place as defined in  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance, and there it is, \"a  place\r\n\r\nto  which  the public or a class of the  public  has\r\n\r\naccess  and  for  purposes  of  entertainment  which\r\n\r\nrequires  licensing.\" That is Ordinance  No.  40  of\r\n\r\n1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on the reading of that letter of the 9th of\r\n\r\nJune,  it is apparent that a meeting in the  private\r\n\r\npremises  of a trade union of persons who are  there\r\n\r\nby  special invitation cannot possibly be deemed  to\r\n\r\nhe a public assembly. This the Commissioner seems to\r\n\r\nhave  noticed  when  a protest was  registered,  the\r\n\r\nprotest  being  the letter of the Committee  of  the\r\n\r\n11th  of  June in which they asked for the  specific\r\n\r\nprovision  of the law whereunder they had  offended.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  we have the letter of the 14th  of  June,\r\n\r\nSir.   Here   he  says,  \"Addresses,  debates   and\r\n\r\ndiscussions at any place to which the public or  any\r\n\r\nclass  of  the public has access, would come  within\r\n\r\nthe  definition of `public entertainment'.\" That  is\r\n\r\nso.  But again, he must have known, because he  does\r\n\r\nnot suggest it here, that it is not the public or  a\r\n\r\nclass of public that has access. The meeting was not\r\n\r\nopen  to,  say, all members of the Indian community,\r\n\r\nor  all  persons who have passed the Chinese  Middle\r\n\r\nIII  School Examination, or anything like that,  and\r\n\r\nhe leaves it at that, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come then to the next one, paragraph 3: \"Conduct\r\n\r\nof  Assemblies  and Places of Public Resort.\"  Well,\r\n\r\nthat  is repetitive, because that would be the  same\r\n\r\nas   public  assembly  which  is  under  the  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance. Again in this  case,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  suggestion that the  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  or  any  part of the public, as  such,  were\r\n\r\nbeing invited. I want you to notice this, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nwhereas - if I may pause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a  moment  the  action  of  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nrefusing a licence to hold a national convention  in\r\n\r\nthe   Badminton  Hall  was  undemocratic,   it   was\r\n\r\nnevertheless  constitutional because  the  Badminton\r\n\r\nHall  was  a  place of public resort  to  which  the\r\n\r\npublic  were  being  invited, and consequently,  the\r\n\r\norganisers  required a licence. The  licence  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  given  if the Government  sought  to  be\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  but in law they were not  compelled  to\r\n\r\ngive it and they could refrain from giving it, as in\r\n\r\nfact  they  refused to give it. So their  action  in\r\n\r\nrefusing  a  licence  to  the  organisers   of   the\r\n\r\nBadminton Hall meeting was undemocratic, in my view,\r\n\r\nbut it was by no means illegal. Here, I seek to draw\r\n\r\nthe  distinction  between what is  undemocratic  but\r\n\r\nlegal  and  what is in fact illegal because  I  have\r\n\r\nsought to show so far, Sir, that this meeting of 9th\r\n\r\nJune  did  not  come within the terms of  \"place  of\r\n\r\npublic  resort\"  or \"public place\" under  the  Minor\r\n\r\nOffences    Ordinance   or    under    the    Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments Ordinance, 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then comes, Sir, paragraph 4 - he seeks to put\r\n\r\neverything  in to catch them if he can, \"If  persons\r\n\r\nwho   attend   the   proposed   meeting   constitute\r\n\r\nthemselves  into  an  association  of  10  or   more\r\n\r\npersons, they would constitute an unlawful society.\"\r\n\r\nNotice  the \"if\", Sir. Sir, if five of us decide  to\r\n\r\ncall  a  national anti-nuclear meeting and  we  send\r\n\r\ninvitations  to  named  organisations  to  send  two\r\n\r\nrepresentatives each to a private home,  no  licence\r\n\r\nis  required, because that is not a public  assembly\r\n\r\nand  there  is no association of 10 or more  persons\r\n\r\nfor  a  specific purpose. Those who are  coming  are\r\n\r\ncoming  to listen. If it is then decided to  form  a\r\n\r\nsociety,   then   you  make  your  application   for\r\n\r\nregistration of the society. But until a decision is\r\n\r\nmade, Sir, there is no question of an association in\r\n\r\nlaw  of  10 or more persons. A tenuous argument  was\r\n\r\nsought  to  be  introduced at this juncture  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  who suggested that  the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthere were 9 members did not itself remove the group\r\n\r\nfrom  the  need  from registration. It  was  put  in\r\n\r\nextraordinary language in the letter of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistrar of Societies, in his letter of the 16th of\r\n\r\nJune where he alleges that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have been advised by the Law Officers\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  the fact that the  number  of  the\r\n\r\npersons forming your Committee does not exceed 9, any\r\n\r\nmeeting  comprising  10  persons  or  more  in  all,\r\n\r\nwhatever its nature or object, will be a meeting  of\r\n\r\na  society  within  the meaning  of  the  Societies'\r\n\r\nOrdinance.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know no lawyer, no matter how beardless he\r\n\r\nmay  be  or  how  wet  around the  ears,  who  could\r\n\r\npossibly  justify that extraordinary proposition.  A\r\n\r\nsociety begins to be a society only if there  is  an\r\n\r\norganised  association of 10 or more persons  for  a\r\n\r\nspecific  object. In this case there were 9  persons\r\n\r\nand   they   were   calling   a   meeting   inviting\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  to make certain representations  to\r\n\r\nthem. I repeat, Mr Speaker, it is unfortunate  that\r\n\r\nthis  matter  is not adumbrated in court  where  the\r\n\r\nposition   could  be  clearly  considered   in   the\r\n\r\nimpartial  atmosphere  of a  court  of  justice  and\r\n\r\ndecided  upon,  because it  is  a  matter  of  major\r\n\r\nconstitutional import that the Government should not\r\n\r\nseek to act illegally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, we have finally paragraph 5. In that\r\n\r\nparagraph  of the letter of 14th June  it  does  not\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the meeting is illegal  but  it  is  a\r\n\r\nclear-cut  threat.  If you hold  the  meeting,  your\r\n\r\nregistration as a union may be cancelled.  It  means\r\n\r\nnothing else. It is clear intimidation, You can call\r\n\r\nit  a warning if you like, but in the context of the\r\n\r\nletter  as  a  whole, I would suggest, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nthat  it is in fact intimidation. I can but say that\r\n\r\nI regret, In the light of the letter of the union of\r\n\r\nthe  11th of June, that the Government did  not  see\r\n\r\nfit  to arrest one of the persons. They signed their\r\n\r\nnames,  they were quite frank about who  they  were.\r\n\r\nThey   did  not  arrest  one  of  the  persons   for\r\n\r\nattempting to organise an illegal meeting  and  then\r\n\r\nhave  the  issue clarified in a court  of  law.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  said  that the  unions  have  their\r\n\r\nremedies.  Mr  Speaker,  I  confess  they  have  my\r\n\r\nsympathy  in this matter. They were told  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  acting  illegally; they had the police  around\r\n\r\nthem.  If  they held a meeting prima fade they  were\r\n\r\nacting  in  an  illegal fashion, I admire  them  for\r\n\r\ntheir    restraint   and   their   urge    to    act\r\n\r\nconstitutionally,  that though  they  believed  they\r\n\r\nwere  right, legally entitled to hold that  meeting,\r\n\r\nnevertheless they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefrained  from  doing so. I  will  say,  Sir,  they\r\n\r\ndeserve  credit for doing so, although it  may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  a more useful approach if one of them at least\r\n\r\nhad risked being arrested so that the issue could be\r\n\r\nclarified  in  a court of law. They  have  no  other\r\n\r\nmeans,   Sir,  at  that  juncture.  You   know   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  of seeking to bring any action  for  a\r\n\r\ndeclaration of right against the Government and  the\r\n\r\ntremendous  technicalities involved, the delays  and\r\n\r\nthe  expense,  Mr Speaker. I would suggest  to  you\r\n\r\nthat,  apart from the lurid bedtime stories we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  listening to, purely on the legal  aspects  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem  as  it  is  presented  to  us  in  the\r\n\r\ndocuments  before us, the Government  does  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave  acted in an illegal fashion and to have abused\r\n\r\nits powers of using the police in a manner for which\r\n\r\nthe  law does not provide. If the Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\nright  in his tale, then it is a question of seeking\r\n\r\nadditional powers to meet unusual circumstances. But\r\n\r\nI  do say this, that in the context of the law as it\r\n\r\nstood on the 9th of June and on the 16th of June, on\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  it,  the Government  does  seem,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, to have acted illegally and knowingly so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the\r\n\r\nmost  sickening acts which show also how  debased  a\r\n\r\ntraitor can be when he betrayed his comrades and his\r\n\r\nParty is the reference to the P.A.P. symbol tonight.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, in comparing the P.A.P. emblem  to\r\n\r\nthe   Fascist   Party  in  Britain,   we   see   how\r\n\r\ntreacherous, how disloyal and how dishonourable  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis Assemblymen have become since  they\r\n\r\nbetrayed  their Party.

They\r\n\r\nare made for the purpose of affording and protecting\r\n\r\ncertain  fundamental rights and civil  liberties  to\r\n\r\nthe greatest number of people. However, these rights\r\n\r\nand  liberties can only be enjoyed if there is peace\r\n\r\nand  good  order. Therefore, the first task  of  any\r\n\r\nState  is  to  maintain law and  order  through  its\r\n\r\npolice force, if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before the House seeks ostensibly to\r\n\r\ncondemn the Government for depriving representatives\r\n\r\nof certain organisations from exercising their civic\r\n\r\nrights   in  calling  meetings  to  discuss  certain\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in fact, what the motion seeks is\r\n\r\nnot the protection of civil rights but the right  of\r\n\r\nthe Communists and their stooges to flout the law as\r\n\r\nand  when  they like in carrying out their nefarious\r\n\r\nactivities  to  undermine and destroy  democracy  by\r\n\r\nfomenting  chaos and disorder in the name  of  human\r\n\r\nrights and civil liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the legal aspect of the\r\n\r\nproposed  meetings  called by  the  so-called  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  Working Committee. I propose to be brief  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect because the various points  have  been\r\n\r\ntouched on by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the first meeting was scheduled\r\n\r\nto  be  held  on  9th  June at the  Singapore  Motor\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees Union at 87  Bukit  Timah  Road.\r\n\r\nThis  was to be a meeting attended by allegedly  one\r\n\r\nhundred   organisations,  ranging  from  old   boys'\r\n\r\nassociations,    rural    organisations,     musical\r\n\r\nassociations to trade unions and political  parties,\r\n\r\nall   of  which  have  different  objects  and  were\r\n\r\nconstituted in a different manner. At this  meeting,\r\n\r\nthe organisations intended to form\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  body  similar to the 1956 Civil Rights Convention\r\n\r\nCommittee  in  order  to promote  further  agitation\r\n\r\nagainst  merger and Malaysia. No permit was  applied\r\n\r\nfor  such  a  public assembly. The  organisers  were\r\n\r\ntherefore  informed  that such a  meeting  would  be\r\n\r\nillegal  and  unconstitutional  and  that  if   they\r\n\r\nproceeded with it, they would lay themselves open to\r\n\r\naction  under  the law. Further, they were  informed\r\n\r\nover the radio that if the meeting was held and  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of the meeting was carried out, the persons\r\n\r\nconcerned  would be acting outside the constitutions\r\n\r\nof  the  unions and other organisations they claimed\r\n\r\nto represent. They called off the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further explanations on points of law were\r\n\r\nfurnished by the police to Inche Hussein Jahidin and\r\n\r\nSalahudin  Ghouse  calling themselves  Chairman  and\r\n\r\nSecretary  of  the Singapore Trade  Unions'  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee on 14th June, 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffice it to say, the proposed meeting on 9th\r\n\r\nJune,  if carried out, would have violated the Minor\r\n\r\nOffences   Ordinance  (Chapter  117),   the   Public\r\n\r\nEntertainments  Ordinance,  No.  40  of  1958,   the\r\n\r\nSocieties  Ordinance, (Chapter 228)  and  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Ordinance (Chapter 154).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organisers sought to by-pass the law by\r\n\r\nreducing   the   so-called  Trade   Unions   Working\r\n\r\nCommittee from 11 to 9 presumably on the bright idea\r\n\r\nof  a  lawyer's clerk - [Interruption] - since  turned\r\n\r\nprofessional trade unionist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Ha, ha!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Mr Ong Pang Boon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a further\r\n\r\nmeeting  was called for on 16th June in the name  of\r\n\r\nthis  Committee now reduced in size. The  organisers\r\n\r\nwere again informed by the Registrar of Societies on\r\n\r\n16th  June  that irrespective of the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of persons forming the Trade Unions  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee   does  not  exceed  nine,   any   meeting\r\n\r\ncomprising 10 persons or more in all, whatsoever its\r\n\r\nnature  or  object would be a meeting of  a  society\r\n\r\nwithin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  meaning  of  the Societies Ordinance  and  that\r\n\r\nunless  such society was registered - which  was  not\r\n\r\ndone  in  this case - it would be an unlawful  society\r\n\r\nand  attendance at any meeting of such a society  or\r\n\r\nmembership thereof would be an offence under section\r\n\r\n12  of the Societies Ordinance. A statement to  this\r\n\r\neffect was issued by Government the same day.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot propose to go any further into the legal aspects\r\n\r\nof  this  case. The Assembly is hardly a  place  for\r\n\r\nlegal argument. Suffice it to say, if the organisers\r\n\r\nof  the  proposed unlawful meetings are dissatisfied\r\n\r\nwith  our  interpretation of the law, they can  seek\r\n\r\nthe assistance of their legal advisers to have their\r\n\r\ngrievances redressed in a court of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is alleged in the House that the police\r\n\r\nhave  acted in a provocative and intimidatory manner\r\n\r\nin  preventing the two meetings from being held. How\r\n\r\ndid  the  police intimidate these tough and seasoned\r\n\r\nprofessional trade unionists?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there were no riot vans outside\r\n\r\nthe  premises of the proposed meeting, and according\r\n\r\nto  the  memorandum of appeal to the Assemblymen  by\r\n\r\nthese trade unions, the intimidation was carried out\r\n\r\nby  the  use  of flash-camera. Camera, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  not  bayonets.  The  Member  for  Anson  loves\r\n\r\ncameras. He likes his picture to be flashed all over\r\n\r\nthe  place. No doubt, the Member for Queenstown,  or\r\n\r\nfor  that  matter  the Member for  Nee  Soon,  feels\r\n\r\nlikewise.  Those of us who are not  up  to  mischief\r\n\r\nhave   no  anxiety  about  cameras,  but  the   pro-Communists  and their sympathisers have  an  intense\r\n\r\ndislike  for the camera, because their faces  cannot\r\n\r\nbear  close scrutiny. They have to operate behind  a\r\n\r\nfront provided by innocent people. No doubt, some of\r\n\r\nthe  persons  invited to attend these  two  proposed\r\n\r\nmeetings belong to this category of persons who fear\r\n\r\nexposure in front of a camera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen how the student agitators hid their\r\n\r\nfaces behind handkerchiefs during the Secondary Four\r\n\r\nExamination  Boycott. We have  also  seen  the  Work\r\n\r\nBrigade strikers dropping parangs and iron rods  and\r\n\r\nscattering  before a camera during the  strike  last\r\n\r\nyear.  We  can therefore understand why they  should\r\n\r\nmake a hue and cry about a camera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is already far too\r\n\r\nmuch work for the police to do in the maintenance of\r\n\r\nlaw  and  order  without having  to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nadditional   deliberate  acts  of  law-breaking   by\r\n\r\ncertain   professional  trade  unionists.  In   this\r\n\r\ninstance,  if  there  were  no  professional   trade\r\n\r\nunionists  going about organising unlawful  meetings\r\n\r\nwith  a view to wrecking merger and Malaysia,  there\r\n\r\nwould be no need for the presence of police officers\r\n\r\nnear  the  premises of the Singapore Motor  Workshop\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union. The police have more worthy  tasks\r\n\r\nto  perform than to prevent unlawful meetings called\r\n\r\nby  persons  who were well aware that such  meetings\r\n\r\nwere unlawful. In spite of the first refusal on  9th\r\n\r\nJune,  the  so-called Trade Unions Working Committee\r\n\r\ndeliberately  called for a second  meeting  on  16th\r\n\r\nJune  which  necessitated  the  presence  of  police\r\n\r\nofficers a second time to warn the convenors of  the\r\n\r\nlegal  consequences.  Without  the  deliberate   and\r\n\r\nprovocative act of the professional trade unionists,\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  no need for police  officers  with\r\n\r\ncameras around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us deal with the purpose or the motive of\r\n\r\nthe two proposed meetings to be held at the premises\r\n\r\nof  the Singapore Motor Workshop Employees Union  at 87 Bukit Timah Road. Ostensibly the meetings were to\r\n\r\nbe  called  to discuss certain so-called undesirable\r\n\r\nfeatures  of the Referendum Bill. However, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  proposed meetings were called to form a  united\r\n\r\nfront  of students, old boys' associations, workers'\r\n\r\nunions,  rural organisations and other people  under\r\n\r\nthe  leadership of the Communists and their  stooges\r\n\r\nto  carry out various forms of agitation not against\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum Bill itself, but against merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia. They hoped that in involving large numbers\r\n\r\nof  different organisations and people - many of whom\r\n\r\nwere  innocent, though gullible - they would be  able\r\n\r\nto  create  an impression of popular dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nand  also  to  provide a protective cover  for  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  A recent parallel to this  attempt  was\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Rights Convention in 1956, the activities\r\n\r\nof   which   eventually  culminated  in  riots   and\r\n\r\nsufferings to untold numbers of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I compare the pattern of the activities of\r\n\r\nthe two organisations, I should like to give a brief\r\n\r\nbackground  of  this so-called Trade Unions  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called Trade Unions Working Committee was\r\n\r\noriginally  known as The Singapore Trade Unions  May\r\n\r\nDay  Joint  Celebrations  Committee  elected  at   a\r\n\r\nmeeting of representatives of trade unions belonging\r\n\r\nto the pro-Communist \r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group held on 18th March,  1962,  at  the\r\n\r\npremises  of the Singapore Motor Workshop  Employees\r\n\r\nUnion.  The  Committee then consisted of 11  persons\r\n\r\nwith  Tan  Teck Wah as Chairman, Foo  Yong  Fong  as\r\n\r\nSecretary, Chan Saye Jame as Treasurer and  8  other\r\n\r\nmembers  comprising Dominic Puthucheary, S.  Ghouse,\r\n\r\nChang Yuen Tong, Chan Yin Ann, Visva Lingam, Chen Ee\r\n\r\nFong,  Goh Chong Kwee and Hussein Jahidin. This  11-man Committee was responsible for organising the May\r\n\r\nDay celebrations by the pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\nof    trade   unions,   student   bodies,   cultural\r\n\r\norganisations,   political   parties    and    rural\r\n\r\norganisations. On the conviction of Foo Yong Fong in\r\n\r\nan  assault case, Mr Tan Siew Chwee took  over  the\r\n\r\npost  of Secretary in this Committee. After the  May\r\n\r\nDay celebrations on 19th May. 1962, the name of this\r\n\r\n11-man   Singapore  Trade  Unions  May   Day   Joint\r\n\r\nCelebrations   Committee  was   changed   into   the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Trade   Unions   National   Day    Joint\r\n\r\nCelebrations Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from a Joint Committee formed with the purpose\r\n\r\nof   organising   the  May  Day  Celebrations,   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  went on to other anti-national activities\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  calling  of a separate  National  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration, the effect of which, of course, was  to\r\n\r\npromote   disunity  of  the  people.  However,   the\r\n\r\nseparate  National Day celebration  called  by  this\r\n\r\nCommittee was cancelled because the organisers  were\r\n\r\nwarned  that  should they pursue their intention  to\r\n\r\norganise  processions,  the organisations  concerned\r\n\r\nwere likely to be considered for de-registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was said just now that the separate National Day\r\n\r\ncelebration  - to be more correct,  it  should  be  a\r\n\r\nprotest meeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  cancelled  by  the  anti-nationalists  iii  the\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. unions  because  of  the  threat  of   de-registration if any of the 10 conditions attached to\r\n\r\nthe permit was breached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Communist stooges in the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  cannot  be  expected  to   speak\r\n\r\nhonestly. These 10 conditions were comprehensive and\r\n\r\nintended  to  cover all kinds of occasions  and  all\r\n\r\nforeseeable   types  of  meetings.  Although   these\r\n\r\nnormal conditions are attached to every permit as a\r\n\r\nmatter  of routine, this does not mean that all  the\r\n\r\nconditions   are  applicable  generally.   In   this\r\n\r\nparticular  instance  about  the  proposed   protest\r\n\r\nmeeting  on National Day at the Happy World Stadium,\r\n\r\nthe   Government  was  specifically  interested   in\r\n\r\ncondition  3,  i.e., there should be no processions.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, all the police were committed  on\r\n\r\nNational  Day  at the Padang where the occasion  was\r\n\r\ncelebrated  by  people  from all  sections  and  all\r\n\r\nstrata of society, unlike the one at the Happy World\r\n\r\nStadium.  If  the  pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  their front  organisations  were\r\n\r\nallowed  to  defy  the law and stage  demonstrations\r\n\r\nalong  the streets of Singapore with hardly a police\r\n\r\nofficer  around even to look after the traffic,  the\r\n\r\nsituation would be very delicate indeed. Hence,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  issued a warning to the organisers  that\r\n\r\nif  they persisted in carrying out their procession,\r\n\r\nthey might be required to show cause why their union\r\n\r\nregistration should not be cancelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his speech just now the Member for Thomson\r\n\r\nattempted  to  create the impression that  the  pro-Communist  S.A.T.U. group of trade unions  were  all\r\n\r\nreasonable  and law-abiding, whereas the  Government\r\n\r\nwas inciting violence. Mr Speaker, Sir, who are the\r\n\r\npeople  the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen are  trying\r\n\r\nto  fool?  These  two meetings of the  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee had to be called off not  because\r\n\r\nthe  pro-Communists were reasonable and law-abiding,\r\n\r\nbut  because, may I suggest, firstly, they  realised\r\n\r\nthese proposed meetings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwere  unlawful; secondly, they were trying  to  find\r\n\r\nout  to what extent the Government were prepared  to\r\n\r\ngo; thirdly, they were still hoping that there might\r\n\r\nbe  a  possible  hitch in the Cobbold Commission  on\r\n\r\nMalaysia;  and  finally,  the  higher-ups  of  their\r\n\r\ncommand  have not yet made up their minds to  resort\r\n\r\nto  more  violent means of struggle, or, to use  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the  Member for Thomson, \"a more  painful\r\n\r\nform of expression\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, Mr Speaker, Sir, this so-called\r\n\r\nTrade  Unions Working Committee was originally known\r\n\r\nas   the  Singapore  Trade  Unions  May  Day   Joint\r\n\r\nCelebration Committee, re-named the Singapore  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions  National  Day  Joint Celebration  Committee.\r\n\r\nThen on 31st May, 1962, this 11-man Committee was renamed  again  and styled itself the Singapore  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Working Committee with a re-shuffle of posts.\r\n\r\nHussein   Jahidin  now  became  the   Chairman   and\r\n\r\nSalahudin Ghouse became the Secretary. It was in the\r\n\r\nname   of  this  so-called  Singapore  Trade  Unions\r\n\r\nWorking  Committee that a meeting  of  trade  unions\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  the  pro-Communist  S.A.T.U. group,\r\n\r\nstudent  bodies,  cultural organisations,  political\r\n\r\nParties  and peasants' organisations was  called  on\r\n\r\n9th  June, 1962, ostensibly to discuss the  National\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill. Here then we see how a  Committee,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  originally formed with  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\norganising a May Day celebration, was turned to good\r\n\r\nuse  by  the  Communist stooges  into  a  weapon  of\r\n\r\npolitical agitation against merger and Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the proposed meetings called by this\r\n\r\nso-called  Trade  Unions Working  Committee  was  to\r\n\r\nbuild a Communist-led united front of students,  old\r\n\r\nboys'    associations,   workers'   unions,    rural\r\n\r\norganisations and other cultural organisations on  a\r\n\r\ncommon  platform  of opposition  to  Government  and\r\n\r\nmerger  and  Malaysia. This move  by  the  Communist\r\n\r\nstooges  is,  in fact, a repetition of  the  history\r\n\r\nleading up to the riots of October 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House will recall that on 28th September. 1956,\r\n\r\nthere  was held at the Hokkien Association  premises\r\n\r\nin Telok\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAyer  Street  a similar meeting which styled  itself\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Civil Rights Convention. Inche Hussein\r\n\r\nJahidin  was the front man of that meeting  and  was\r\n\r\nelected  to  the Civil Rights Convention  Committee.\r\n\r\nThe   workings  and  agitation  of  this   Committee\r\n\r\neventually  ended  in the riots of  1956.  The  1956\r\n\r\nCommittee, which also comprised 11 persons like  the\r\n\r\npresent  one, also drew its members from a so-called\r\n\r\nTrade Unions Working Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House may be aware that the attempt at forming\r\n\r\na  united front by the 11-man so-called Trade Unions\r\n\r\nWorking Committee having failed, the Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir  stooges  attempted  another  one,  this  time\r\n\r\ncalling   itself   the  Council  of   Joint   Action\r\n\r\ncomprising  five  political  Parties  - the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis, the Workers' Party, the Partai Rakyat, the\r\n\r\nUnited Democratic Party, and the Liberal Socialists.\r\n\r\nThis so-called Council of Joint Action - a name which\r\n\r\neven  the  Member  for Anson felt  rather  squeamish\r\n\r\nabout  - then  picked  up where the  so-called  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Working Committee had left off, and attempted\r\n\r\nto  revive  the united front by calling a convention\r\n\r\nof civic organisations to be held on 6th July at the\r\n\r\nBadminton  Hall. Now having refused  the  Communists\r\n\r\nand  their stooges their meeting for a united  front\r\n\r\norganisation   through  the  Trade  Unions   Working\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the  Government  has  no  intention   of\r\n\r\nallowing  the Communists the use of the  Council  of\r\n\r\nJoint  Action  to  start  another  convention.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  no  intention of  allowing  diverse\r\n\r\norganisations  constituted  for  different  purposes\r\n\r\nfrom  coagulating  and  perverting  themselves  into\r\n\r\nTrade   Unions   Working  Committee,  Civil   Rights\r\n\r\nConvention, Council of Joint Action, etc.  Attracted\r\n\r\nto the latest \"Council of Joint Action\" are a number\r\n\r\nof  persons who are being used with their  knowledge\r\n\r\nto  provide a cover of respectability the Communists\r\n\r\nneed  for carrying out their present work. If  these\r\n\r\npeople   continue   consciously  and   publicly   to\r\n\r\nassociate  themselves as co-sponsors of a  Communist\r\n\r\nUnited Front campaign after their attention has been\r\n\r\ndrawn to the probable consequences of such a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunist united front campaign, then they  will  be\r\n\r\nheld  responsible  equally with the  Communists  and\r\n\r\ntheir associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, however, to make it clear to the House that\r\n\r\nthe  Government is not against political Parties  or\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  holding meetings for which  they  are\r\n\r\nproperly  constituted. The Government  has  recently\r\n\r\napproved  permits to the Singapore Rural  Residents'\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  the  Singapore  Country   People's\r\n\r\nAssociation  to  hold their annual general  meetings\r\n\r\nand  celebrations;  and  the Singapore  Bus  Workers\r\n\r\nUnion   and   the  Wood  Workers  Union   to   stage\r\n\r\ncelebrations  and  concerts  to  commemorate   their\r\n\r\nanniversaries.  In  these meetings,  bitter  attacks\r\n\r\nwere   made   against  the  Referendum   Bill.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has also approved permits to the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty,  the Barisan Sosialis and the United People's\r\n\r\nParty  to hold public meetings, specially to  attack\r\n\r\nthe  Referendum Bill. Therefore, the charge that the\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   denying  the  people   and   their\r\n\r\norganisations  their fundamental  democratic  rights\r\n\r\nand civil liberties is utter nonsense.

They make use of their\r\n\r\nstooges  to  stand  in  the front  line  while  they\r\n\r\nthemselves  remain in the background. The Communists\r\n\r\nset up front organisations in the name of democratic\r\n\r\ninstitutions   fighting  for  civil   rights.   They\r\n\r\ninfiltrate into trade unions, student organisations,\r\n\r\ncultural organisations, political Parties and  every\r\n\r\npossible  institution and organisation  to  make  it\r\n\r\nlook  as  though these organisations  are  genuinely\r\n\r\nexpressing their opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the very naive and the uninitiated will tag\r\n\r\nalong  with  them  in  their insidious  campaign  to\r\n\r\npoison and pollute the atmosphere around us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the events which have taken place\r\n\r\nin Singapore and Malaya since the termination of the\r\n\r\nSecond  World War are still fresh in our  minds.  To\r\n\r\nthe  casual  observer who recalls them in isolation,\r\n\r\nthese  events may not reveal much. But to those  who\r\n\r\ntake the trouble to follow and understand them,  the\r\n\r\nnefarious activities of the Communists will  clearly\r\n\r\nshow  a  familiar pattern not unlike those found  in\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where armed insurrection and violence have failed,\r\n\r\nas   in  the  case  of  Burma,  Indonesia  and   the\r\n\r\nPhilippines, the Communists change their tactics and\r\n\r\nstrategy to that of subtle infiltration into legally\r\n\r\nconstituted  organisations.  Where  they  are   held\r\n\r\nsuspect  and cannot function by themselves, they  go\r\n\r\ninto alliance with men who have \"respectability\"  in\r\n\r\nthe  public eye. In such alliances they exploit  the\r\n\r\ngenuine grievances of political leaders, student and\r\n\r\ncultural  leaders, and never fail to feign  sympathy\r\n\r\nand   support  for  these  leaders.  Outwardly  they\r\n\r\nsubscribe to democratic principles and lend  support\r\n\r\nto  any overt expression of dissatisfaction with so-called  threats to the democratic system.  In  their\r\n\r\nminds   they   have   the   utmost   contempt    for\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy. But, of course,  they  are\r\n\r\nthe  most  articulate  in  their  pronouncements  in\r\n\r\nsupport of parliamentary democracy. They do not even\r\n\r\nhesitate to out-do and out-bid innocent democrats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the call for greater democratic rights and wider\r\n\r\ncivil liberties. To the Communists this phase of the\r\n\r\nactivities  is understood as the \"minimum struggle\",\r\n\r\nthe maximum struggle being to oust their allies when\r\n\r\nthey have gained enough strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it is today when we are on the threshold of\r\n\r\nmerger and Malaysia. They know what they will be  in\r\n\r\nfor   and  they  know  what  will  happen  to  their\r\n\r\nCommunist  activities in Singapore with  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They accuse the Government, Mr Speaker, Sir, in\r\n\r\nthe  memorandum  to Assemblymen of  playing  up  the\r\n\r\nCommunist  bogey. Mr Speaker, Sir,  a  bogey  is  a\r\n\r\nghost.  But  the Communists are neither  bogeys  nor\r\n\r\nghosts.  They exist in our midst. And we  know  they\r\n\r\nexist.  If the Communists were bogeys, then  Stalin,\r\n\r\nMao,  Ho  Chih Minh, Chin Peng, Aidit and all  their\r\n\r\nfollowers were also bogeys. If they were bogeys, the\r\n\r\nM.C.P. could not have started their violent  revolt\r\n\r\nin 1948. If Chin Peng was a bogey, he would not have\r\n\r\ndemanded,  as  one of the conditions  to  surrender,\r\n\r\nthat the Communist Party of Malaya be legalised. The\r\n\r\nHouse  is  aware  that  a  Commission  is  currently\r\n\r\nsitting to inquire into the Communist activities  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools. We shall see  whether  Communist\r\n\r\nactivities in schools are facts or bogeys. No,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthey  existed  then and they are still in  existence\r\n\r\ntoday. The only difference being that today they  do\r\n\r\nnot  carry the Communist flag, and they do not  wear\r\n\r\nthe  symbol  of the hammer and the sickle  on  their\r\n\r\nshirts.  They have hidden these emblems of Communism\r\n\r\nin  their pockets for reasons of security - their own\r\n\r\nsecurity and safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1948 they helped to set up the All-Malaya\r\n\r\nCouncil of Joint Action which organised a hartal  to\r\n\r\noppose  the  first  Federation of Malaya  Agreement.\r\n\r\nUnder the then prevailing circumstances, they wanted\r\n\r\na united Malaya with Singapore. Now they do not want\r\n\r\na  united  Malaya.  In 1956 they set  up  the  Civil\r\n\r\nRights  Convention.  Today they  are  attempting  to\r\n\r\nrevive  it  to  carry  out  their  anti-merger   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  campaign. In 1957 they  formed  the  Anti-Yellow Culture Council. Now, unfortunately for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem, they are unable to form a similar organisation\r\n\r\nsimply  because they cannot find support for such  a\r\n\r\nbody because the Government has done all it could to\r\n\r\nstamp  out yellow culture. Likewise, they find  that\r\n\r\nthe  people are satisfied with the education  policy\r\n\r\ngiving  equal treatment to all streams of education.\r\n\r\nSo they cannot successfully mount opposition against\r\n\r\nthe Government in this field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, can we allow the pattern\r\n\r\nof  events we learned so bitterly in the past to  be\r\n\r\nrepeated?  One reason why the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nstooges have failed last year and this year is  that\r\n\r\nnow  the  people are already aware of the facts  and\r\n\r\nthe  truth. The people are aware that the  so-called\r\n\r\nundemocratic   action  which  the   Government   was\r\n\r\nsupposed   to  have  taken  at  the  Motor  Workshop\r\n\r\nEmployees  Union is nothing more than a reminder  to\r\n\r\nthe  organisers not to break the law. The organisers\r\n\r\nknew  very  well  that an assembly  of  10  or  more\r\n\r\npersons  not belonging to the same registered  trade\r\n\r\nunion  or  other organisations would  constitute  an\r\n\r\nunlawful assembly and that they would have  to  face\r\n\r\naction  as stipulated in the law. After they  failed\r\n\r\nin  this  first attempt to defy the law, these  same\r\n\r\nmischief-makers next set about forcing their beliefs\r\n\r\nthrough the so-called \"Council of Joint Action\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is determined to\r\n\r\navoid  the  mistakes of past years. It  will  expose\r\n\r\nevery attempt by the Communists to build up a united\r\n\r\nfront of legal organisations. It will be failing  in\r\n\r\nits  duty  if  it  allows the Communists  and  their\r\n\r\nstooges  to  have their way in wrecking  merger  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The people hope the Government  does  not\r\n\r\nlet  them  down  this time and at any  time  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  The  stakes  are  too  big,  for   we   are\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the lives of  1.7  million  people\r\n\r\nwhose  happiness depends not on what the  Communists\r\n\r\nsay  and  do, but on what is even  more  vital  and\r\n\r\ngreater, and that is that their future in  Malaysia\r\n\r\nmust be secure and their prosperity ensured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nfully support this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotion.  In  this motion the Member for Thomson  has\r\n\r\nstated  very clearly our point of view.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson  has  also spoken very clearly  from  the\r\n\r\npoint  of  view  of  law.  Therefore, there  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity for me to repeat what they have said.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, in a speech which  lasted\r\n\r\nabout  one  hour, mentioned Communists,  Communists,\r\n\r\nmore than 100 times. But he did not produce any  new\r\n\r\nand fresh arguments. He was repeating the pet phrase\r\n\r\nwhich  is  used by the P.A.P., that is, \"Communists,\r\n\r\nCommunists\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Minister for Home Affairs in his one-hour speech said one sentence which was very\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  me. He said that the  Civil  Rights\r\n\r\nConvention  of 1956 is the same as the present  one.\r\n\r\nThe  1956 and 1962 Civil Rights Conventions are  the\r\n\r\nsame  because their purpose is the same, that is  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard and protect the fundamental rights of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  But we have to carefully study the sentence\r\n\r\nspoken  by  him.  Let  us recall  the  Civil  Rights\r\n\r\nConvention  of 1956. The present Prime Minister  was\r\n\r\nthe  legal  adviser to that Civil Rights  Convention\r\n\r\nthen  and the organisers are also the same group  of\r\n\r\norganisers of the present Convention. In  the  short\r\n\r\nperiod of six years, on the question of safeguarding\r\n\r\nthe  people's fundamental rights under the same  law\r\n\r\nin the same country and by the same group of people,\r\n\r\nthe Civil Rights Convention in 1962 is now termed as\r\n\r\nCommunist-inspired. Why should it be  like  this?  I\r\n\r\nhave  tried my best but I cannot find any difference\r\n\r\nbetween the present Civil Rights Convention and  the\r\n\r\none  in  1956.  There might be only one  difference:\r\n\r\nthat  is,  Mr  Lee Kuan Yew was in  the  Opposition\r\n\r\nParty,  but  today  he  is  the  Prime  Minister  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. This is the only difference. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  during the adjournment for tea after the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  had finished his speech, I told  him  that\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister of today is a person who  after\r\n\r\ncrossing a river demolishes the bridge. I also  told\r\n\r\nhim  that  as soon as he catches a fish  he  forgets\r\n\r\nabout  the fishing net. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  sort\r\n\r\nof person will be drowned in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nend.  When discussing the National Referendum  Bill,\r\n\r\none  thing  interested me very much. The Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill \"presented\" a pair of gloves to the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister which was stained with blood and filth. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has always said that he  will  never\r\n\r\nuse  the dirty and bloody gloves of the Lim Yew Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but today the Member for Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\npresented  these gloves to the Prime  Minister,  and\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister  is now  making  use  of  these\r\n\r\nbloodstained gloves. But there is one difference  in\r\n\r\nthis  pair of gloves, and that is that although this\r\n\r\npair  of  gloves was made in Britain, the  brand  is\r\n\r\ndifferent.  This  pair  of  dirty  and  bloodstained\r\n\r\ngloves has got the brand of Lee Kuan Yew. Therefore,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, in debating this  question,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. are not able to produce any new arguments  on\r\n\r\nthis  matter.  What they are doing  is  to  use  the\r\n\r\npretext of \"Communists, Communists\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope my last\r\n\r\nsentence  will  be remembered by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nand  his Back Benchers. Whatever we do, we must  not\r\n\r\ndemolish the bridge after having crossed the  river;\r\n\r\nand we must not forget the fishing net after we have\r\n\r\ncaught the fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Fung Yin Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Fung Yin Ching (Stamford)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this  motion before  us  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious  motion.

This\r\n\r\nsentence  was  obtained from the debate.  Today  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister does not want the people to  discuss\r\n\r\nthings  concerning their rights. From the speech  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs as well as that of the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, we know that they dare not face  the\r\n\r\nquestions,  but they try their best  to  smear,  and\r\n\r\nthey  push  all  the unsolved questions  on  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  as  if the Communists have  become  the\r\n\r\nlife-savers  of the P.A.P.

At the same time,  it\r\n\r\nis also known for political opportunism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say three things about the speech of the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister.  Just  now he  has  said  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Party has been used as stooges  by\r\n\r\nthe  Communists. But I think this is ridiculous.  Do\r\n\r\nyou  say  that  if  we  are  going  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nfundamental rights of the people, we are being  used\r\n\r\nas  stooges by the Communists?

We have rights and we have faith.  We  have\r\n\r\nfound  out the position in which these organisations\r\n\r\nconcerned have been put. They have been deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the struggle against colonialism, in\r\n\r\nconstitutional progress, and in the reunification of\r\n\r\nthe  two  territories, these democratic  rights  are\r\n\r\nmost  important. What little democracy we have  been\r\n\r\nenjoying  are  the results of our struggles  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  All  the suppressed peoples of the world  and\r\n\r\nthose  colonised and suppressed countries have stood\r\n\r\nup   bravely,  struggling  to  secure  the  people's\r\n\r\ndemocratic  rights and to secure their  welfare  and\r\n\r\ntheir  future.  These have been  the  objectives  of\r\n\r\nthese peoples. This is something the cunning British\r\n\r\ncolonialists cannot stop.

I\r\n\r\nthink  he  asked, \"Are we to allow  the  pattern  of\r\n\r\nevents  we  learned so bitterly in the  past  to  be\r\n\r\nrepeated?\" He posed that question in the House.  But\r\n\r\nI  do  not know whom he meant by\"we\". Surely it  was\r\n\r\nnot the P.A.P. who learned the pattern of events. It\r\n\r\nwas the P.A.P. who formed the pattern of events. But\r\n\r\nif  the  Government now, having been a party to  the\r\n\r\npattern  of  events  in the past that  have  brought\r\n\r\nmisery and hardship to the people of Singapore,  are\r\n\r\nprepared to learn the mistake of their ways and  are\r\n\r\nnow  willing  to nail their erstwhile  friends  with\r\n\r\nwhom  they  had worked together, there is no  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  we, as a responsible Opposition, should do what\r\n\r\nhe  did  when he was in the Opposition. We  did  our\r\n\r\nbest  to  contain the Communists.  We  did  what  we\r\n\r\nthought  was right for the good of the country.  But\r\n\r\nit  was  he who led in the formation of that pattern\r\n\r\nof  events which is now unfolding itself. But  there\r\n\r\nis one difference in this pattern of events, Sir, In\r\n\r\n1956 it was I who stood on the other side facing the\r\n\r\nCommunists, aided and abetted by the P.A.P. Today it\r\n\r\nis  the P.A.P. Government that has to face the  same\r\n\r\nCommunist  threat. But I can assure  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that the S.P.A. will at no time  aid  and\r\n\r\nabet the Communists to overthrow the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I heard from the Member for Havelock that I\r\n\r\nhave  presented  a  pair  of  gloves  to  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  If he is so anxious to know what  I  have\r\n\r\npresented to the Prime Minister, may I tell him that\r\n\r\nthrough  my actions against the Communists  in  1956\r\n\r\nand 1957 I presented to him the government under the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution?  I  am happy  that  after  having\r\n\r\nreceived the present of being in the government,  he\r\n\r\nis now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving a dose of the medicine which he gave  to  me\r\n\r\nwhen I was in the Government. My hope is that having\r\n\r\nto  swallow this bitter pill, the P.A.P. will really\r\n\r\nmean  business when they say that the  interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore should be protected.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to do it in the way that they think is  right.\r\n\r\nEvents  will prove whether they are right or whether\r\n\r\nthey are wrong. But I would like to say that I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Prime Minister that this pattern of events\r\n\r\nis  really coming to the forefront. There have  been\r\n\r\nindications in the past few days, and in fact in the\r\n\r\npast few months, that the Communists are mounting  a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to damage merger, or what is more  correct\r\n\r\nto  say,  closer association with the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. They are, in this attempt, adopting the same\r\n\r\ntactics that they adopted during my time. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  was with them the  other  time,  now\r\n\r\nknows  that the best way to meet them is to do  what\r\n\r\nhe  has  been  doing. Since this is a fight  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  against the Communists, it is  our  duty\r\n\r\nnot   to  make  the  job  more  difficult  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  since it is  a  retracing  of  the\r\n\r\npattern  of events that took place in 1956 and  1957\r\n\r\nwhen  the  P.A.P. was in the lead, the  S.P.A. will\r\n\r\nabstain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.25 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, we long ago expected that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis and their fellow travellers  wanted\r\n\r\nto  smear our stand. We believe that everyone  knows\r\n\r\nthat  when  we of the P.A.P. will not go  with  them\r\n\r\ninto a blind alley they will resort to certain means\r\n\r\nto  try  to  topple the P.A.P. In a short  space  of\r\n\r\ntime, the people have seen clearly their motives and\r\n\r\nactions.  They  have been trying  to  use  the  word\r\n\r\n\"democracy\" to cover their viciousness.  They  hoped\r\n\r\nthat the Government would make use of the police  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the students and to have conflicts  with\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  They hoped that the Government  would\r\n\r\nmake  things unpleasant. But the P.A.P. in all these\r\n\r\nthings  have  made preparations. We associated  with\r\n\r\nthem  for  some time.

That is why when we parted ways with them,\r\n\r\nwe prepared steps in anticipation of what they would\r\n\r\ndo.  Although  in the past one year there  was  such\r\n\r\nconfusion  in  Singapore, the Government  peacefully\r\n\r\npassed through the unnecessary turmoil and confusion\r\n\r\ncreated  by  them.

It  is  because  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis want to resort to their ways to condemn the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. that they have brought up a motion  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. They realise clearly that the P.A.P. have all\r\n\r\nalong adopted the correct stand. If we want to  seek\r\n\r\npolitical rights, we must do it through peaceful and\r\n\r\nconstitutional means in accordance with  the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the  people. Have they now forgotten  about  all\r\n\r\nthis? They have been guilty of double talking.  They\r\n\r\nshould know that the P.A.P. will not act contrary to\r\n\r\ntheir principles. We will struggle for the interests\r\n\r\nof   the  people  under  our  Party  banner  and  in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  our principles. They  have  talked\r\n\r\nabout forgetting the net after catching the fish and\r\n\r\ndestroying the bridge after crossing a river. Now  I\r\n\r\nthrow back all these phrases to them.

Any  dirty\r\n\r\ngovernment  can interpret the law to  suit  its  own\r\n\r\nconvenience.  I  have  had the personal  experience,\r\n\r\nSir, of being charged by this P.A.P.

It is not that we really broke  the\r\n\r\nlaw, Sir. The law says that you are not supposed  to\r\n\r\ncause   violence;  you  are  not  supposed   to   be\r\n\r\ndisorderly.  There  is no suggestion  whatsoever  in\r\n\r\nthis particular case that there was any commotion or\r\n\r\nany  disorder.

Everybody  in  town  is  against   the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Bill, and if you do not allow  people  a\r\n\r\nfree  means  of expression to condemn the Government\r\n\r\nfor  its  dishonesty  and dictatorship,  what  other\r\n\r\nopportunities  are  left  for  the  people  to  give\r\n\r\nexpression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  their feelings against the Government?

Because on the\r\n\r\n26th of October, 1956, there was a violent scene  on\r\n\r\nthe premises of the Motor Workshop Employees' Union,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  mean that every meeting held in the  Motor\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees' Union will necessarily  end  in\r\n\r\nviolence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I pointed out earlier on that if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had no intention of wanting  to  provoke\r\n\r\nviolence, they could have informed the convenors and\r\n\r\nthe  organisers well before 7 p.m. on the  night  of\r\n\r\nJune  1962. No, they chose the last moment. Why  did\r\n\r\nthey  want to choose the last moment to inform  that\r\n\r\nthe  meeting was banned? The news was flashed in the\r\n\r\n7  p.m. news  over  Radio Singapore.  If  they  had\r\n\r\ninformed  the convenors earlier in the day,  morning\r\n\r\nor in the early afternoon, there would not have been\r\n\r\nanybody going to the premises of the Singapore Motor\r\n\r\nWorkshop  Employees'  Union. As  I  said,  no,  they\r\n\r\nthought fit only to inform at the last moment.  They\r\n\r\nknew that delegates would be coming to the premises.\r\n\r\nThey knew that when they discovered the meeting  was\r\n\r\nbeing  banned wrongly, they would be  in  a  fit  of\r\n\r\ntemper. To make matters worse, they had their police\r\n\r\nforce to indulge in very provocative acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs said there were\r\n\r\nno riot vans. I am sure if he checks up his records,\r\n\r\nhe  will find that riot vans were parked near by the\r\n\r\npremises of the Union. And if they want photographs,\r\n\r\nwe   ourselves   are  quite  prepared   to   produce\r\n\r\nphotographs to show where the riot vans were  parked\r\n\r\nand who were the chaps who were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nguarding  them.  Incidentally, Mr  Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  reminds me - once the Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nsaid if we were to produce a picture showing the use\r\n\r\nof police on the workers, he would give us $50,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Business Houses Employees' Union\r\n\r\nhas  published a very good picture - in fact,  a  few\r\n\r\ngood  pictures - of police assault on the workers  in\r\n\r\ntheir  organ  called the Baybuck,  and  nothing  has\r\n\r\nhappened.  I  do  not see the Minister  for  Culture\r\n\r\nmaking  any  suggestion that he  is  happy  that  we\r\n\r\npublished these pictures. But, in any case, now,  if\r\n\r\nthey are doubtful, if they think we are dishonest in\r\n\r\nsaying  that  there  were riot vans,  we  are  quite\r\n\r\nprepared to produce pictures to show that there were\r\n\r\nriot  vans. The Minister for Home Affairs said  that\r\n\r\nall  that  happened was police photographers  taking\r\n\r\nphotographs.  He  thought fit to make  fun  of  some\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House. Sir, I do not think  anybody\r\n\r\nwho  attended  the meeting at the premises  of  this\r\n\r\nUnion  on  the  9th and 16th were  afraid  of  being\r\n\r\nphotographed. I am personally not camera shy.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite certain that nobody was afraid of being caught\r\n\r\nby  a  camera.  But the manner in which  the  police\r\n\r\nphotographer was acting was itself a provocation.  I\r\n\r\nhave  the  advantage  over  the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  because I was there myself. I know how  the\r\n\r\npolice   photographer  behaved  himself.  Sir,   the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Home  Affairs  suggested  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trade  Unions Working  Committee  reduced\r\n\r\nitself  to  having  nine members from  the  original\r\n\r\neleven on the advice of a lawyer's clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Who was the lawyer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> K.

Byrne!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, I must say that if the Committee was\r\n\r\nreduced  in  number, it was not on the advice  of  a\r\n\r\nlawyer's clerk, but it was on the suggestion made by\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of Societies himself.  Incidentally,\r\n\r\nagain  on  a  number of occasions, both  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside  this House, we have heard expressions  from\r\n\r\nthe Government which seem to disclose an attitude of\r\n\r\ncontempt and snobbery in regard to lawyers'  clerks.\r\n\r\nI wonder, on such occasions, what the feelings of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmy  good friend, the Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, who was for a very long time a\r\n\r\nlawyer's clerk in the legal firm of Lee & Lee,  are?\r\n\r\nSir,  all  the legal aspects of the issue - I  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  very  much  to say about them - have  been  very\r\n\r\nadequately  dealt with by the Member  for  Anson.  I\r\n\r\ncannot do any better even if I tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> He is a humbug.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> But I can assure the Ministers and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Members, particularly the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  who is very anxious to know who gave the  legal\r\n\r\nopinion,  that  whatever legal  opinion  the  40-odd\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  took,  whatever  legal  opinion   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Trade Unions Working Committee took,  was\r\n\r\nnot  from what they call a lawyer's clerk. They were\r\n\r\ntaken  from  a  very leading firm of  advocates  and\r\n\r\nsolicitors in Singapore. As the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nclearly put forward the case, it has been made clear\r\n\r\nto   us   that   the  Government  not   only   acted\r\n\r\nundemocratically in denying the unions the right  to\r\n\r\nhold meetings, but also acted unconstitutionally. It\r\n\r\nis  our view that the Government not only sought  to\r\n\r\ndeny  the  people  the  fundamental  right  to  hold\r\n\r\ndiscussions,   the   fundamental   right   of   free\r\n\r\nassociation  and  free communication,  but  it  also\r\n\r\nsought  to  act  unconstitutionally and  beyond  the\r\n\r\nlimits of its powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House divided: Ayes, 17; Noes, 21; Absent, 5;\r\n\r\nAbstentions, 6; Paired, 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Ayes.
