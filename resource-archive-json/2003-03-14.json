Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nwith  your  permission, I would like to  take  the  three\r\n\r\nitems, (d), (e) and (f), together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mission statement of the Ministry of Defence is\r\n\r\n\"to  enhance Singapore's peace and security,  and  should\r\n\r\ndeterrence  and  diplomacy fail, to secure  a  swift  and\r\n\r\ndecisive victory over the aggressor\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defence budget for 2003 is over $8 billion and\r\n\r\nfor  2002 it was also over $8 billion. This is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   It  is the largest budget compared to  the  next\r\n\r\nMinistry, which I believe is that of Education, having  a\r\n\r\nbudget  of about $6.5 billion.  All of us would  like  to\r\n\r\nsee  this money being available for use for good deeds  - I  am  not saying that the Defence Ministry is not one  - including  for poor people and retrenched workers  during\r\n\r\nthis time of retrenchment and slow\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  in  Singapore.  But this is not to  be.   We  are\r\n\r\naware  that  the  defence of a country is  important  and\r\n\r\nmoney  is required for this.  However, I ask the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Defence:  do we need to spend so much? Can the sum not\r\n\r\nbe  reduced  during these difficult times?  Would  it  be\r\n\r\ndangerously and critically insecure for Singapore if  the\r\n\r\nbudget  is reduced, even reduced drastically, and if  so,\r\n\r\nwhy?   Please give us the reasons why this sum cannot  be\r\n\r\nreduced. We are all aware of the need to have a deterrent\r\n\r\nforce,  fully ready for the worst scenario.  However,  we\r\n\r\nhave never had a war on major conflict since independence\r\n\r\nin  1965. The last was in the 1960s during the Indonesian\r\n\r\nConfrontation.  It has been 40 years since then,  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  had  peace all along, both in Singapore,  Indonesia\r\n\r\nand Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it that we are always concerned about, if at\r\n\r\nall, Malaysia and Indonesia.  I take it that there is  no\r\n\r\nreal  or perceived threat from any other external forces,\r\n\r\nno  other  ASEAN  country or any other  foreign  country,\r\n\r\nexcept  perhaps in today's context, terrorists, depending\r\n\r\non  how we define this term. There is so much talk  about\r\n\r\nwar and terrorism these days.  It is all gloom and, added\r\n\r\nto  that, the economic gloom. Why is there so little talk\r\n\r\nof   peace  and  harmony  by  our  leaders  and  all  the\r\n\r\ninternational statesmen and spiritual leaders -  if  they\r\n\r\nare  speaking about good and peace for the world?  Please\r\n\r\ngive it all the prime time airing.  And I urge the press,\r\n\r\nradio and television to report them, instead of months of\r\n\r\nBush  and  Saddam conflict.  It may not even  be  US-Iraq\r\n\r\nconflict,  mind  you, and Prime Minister  Tony  Blair  of\r\n\r\nEngland, and it may not even be England that wants to  go\r\n\r\nto war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, in my view, all countries should have a\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Peace, and not Ministry  of  Defence.   And\r\n\r\nMinisters all over the world should make it their primary\r\n\r\nobjective   to  reduce  conflict,  reduce   build-up   of\r\n\r\narmaments,  nuclear weapons or any form of arms  build-up\r\n\r\nand  accessories,  including war planes,  warships,  army\r\n\r\ntanks, artillery and a whole host of weaponry.  And  that\r\n\r\nis what causes the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  in defence budget, is it not?  And who benefits\r\n\r\neconomically  -  the big corporations,  manufacturers  of\r\n\r\narmaments,  builders of planes, ships, etc,  USA,  France\r\n\r\nand  the big powers?  I am not sure whether Singapore  is\r\n\r\ninvolved.  If so, let us reflect and search our souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the increase in military personnel in the\r\n\r\nArmy, Air Force and Navy and support administrative staff\r\n\r\ngoes   to  increase  the  budget.   Hopefully,  all   the\r\n\r\ncomputerisation   would  reduce  the  cost   but,   then,\r\n\r\ncomputerisation is expensive too.  My guess  is  that  we\r\n\r\nfear  aggression  from Malaysia and  Indonesia;  Malaysia\r\n\r\nfears  Singapore,  and  Indonesia and  perhaps  Thailand;\r\n\r\nIndonesia   fears   Singapore,   Malaysia   and   perhaps\r\n\r\nAustralia.   We  all fear each other in our  minds.   Are\r\n\r\nthese fears real or perceived?  Are all the three or four\r\n\r\ncountries that I have talked about and their top military\r\n\r\ngenerals  and Defence Ministers theorising  a  lot?   Are\r\n\r\nthey being realistic?  Am I being realistic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably since the 1960s, after our independence in\r\n\r\n1965,  which  has been about 37 years, the generals  have\r\n\r\nbeen  harbouring this fear, I believe.  In  a  sense,  it\r\n\r\nmakes them all relevant and feel important.  There should\r\n\r\nbe  a  new thinking by political, military, and spiritual\r\n\r\nleaders, and our citizens should play a greater  role  in\r\n\r\nbeing critical of people who talk about war and conflict.\r\n\r\nThey  must  justify  their actions  and  remove  all  the\r\n\r\nsecrecy  which does not help at all for either Singapore,\r\n\r\nMalaysia or Indonesia.  Individually, all of us are peace\r\n\r\nloving.    Our  Ministers,  military  generals,   defence\r\n\r\nofficials  and  citizens all want peace  and  harmony,  a\r\n\r\ndecent  job and a happy family.  That is all we ask  for.\r\n\r\nThat must be the same with Malaysia and Indonesia, is  it\r\n\r\nnot, and USA, UK and Iraq or any country for that matter?\r\n\r\nBut  when individual human beings take on important roles\r\n\r\nin   the  institution  of  government,  things  strangely\r\n\r\nchange.   How come?  Please review all our positions  and\r\n\r\nsearch  our  souls  to  do good for Singapore  and  other\r\n\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge our Ministry of Defence to initiate\r\n\r\nthis process of creating a Ministry of Peace, and for the\r\n\r\nUnited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNations  and the rest of the world to seriously  consider\r\n\r\nand  come  up with workable solutions.  And through  this\r\n\r\nprocess, defence budgets could be drastically reduced and\r\n\r\nmade  available to other Ministries and for the  good  of\r\n\r\nour people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, MINDEF has\r\n\r\nalways maintained parallel diplomatic communication links\r\n\r\nwith  all  major defence forces all over  the  world,  in\r\n\r\nparticular  with  our neighbouring countries.   And  such\r\n\r\nexcellent diplomatic relation has stood the test of  time\r\n\r\neven  during crisis, even with countries such as Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to ask the Minister for Defence\r\n\r\nis:   what  additional  steps  MINDEF  has  in  place  to\r\n\r\nincrease   greater  defence  cooperation  and  diplomatic\r\n\r\ncommunication   with   the   various   defence    forces,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those involving our strategic partners  and\r\n\r\nthe neighbouring countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong Chit Chung, you can take both\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, earlier on, Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan asked whether he was realistic. The  answer\r\n\r\nclearly is no.  It reminds me of Neville Chamberlain, the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of England in the late 1930s.  He met  up\r\n\r\nwith Hitler and he came back to England and waved a piece\r\n\r\nof paper and said, \"Peace at hand\", and immediately after\r\n\r\nthat,  Hitler invaded France and other parts  of  Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd Chamberlain lived in shame in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot take peace for granted. To have peace,\r\n\r\nyou must be prepared for war and you must be prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake  your  defences seriously so that  with  deterrence,\r\n\r\npeace will prevail.  But if you let down your guard,  you\r\n\r\nwould have no peace at all because people would take  you\r\n\r\nfor an easy ride. And this is what we in Singapore should\r\n\r\nnot  do.  So we should not be saying out in public  about\r\n\r\nplaying  down  our  defences because then,  we  would  be\r\n\r\ndefenceless.   To  have peace, you must be  prepared  for\r\n\r\nwar,  and with deterrence, war will never occur. That  is\r\n\r\nour best bet for our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at the new strategic landscape in\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia, we can see that all the more  we  should\r\n\r\ngive  special attention and priority to defence.  We face\r\n\r\nnot  only  conventional threats, but also  low  intensity\r\n\r\nconflicts and operations, terrorist attacks and  threats.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  Sir,  the SAF has concentrated on  conventional\r\n\r\nthreats  and operations.  Is the SAF able, in  these  new\r\n\r\ncircumstances, to adapt and reorientate itself to take on\r\n\r\nboth  conventional threats and low intensity  operations?\r\n\r\nWe  want to know whether the SAF is trained well  and  is\r\n\r\nready  for it for the new tasks ahead.  We know that  the\r\n\r\nSAF  trains  rigorously here in Singapore as well  as  in\r\n\r\nmany  overseas  countries but some, Sir,  are  still  are\r\n\r\nunaware  of  the operational readiness and capability  of\r\n\r\nour armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, at an informal dialogue session in my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  a lady asked me whether SAF  soldiers  are\r\n\r\ngood  in  shooting  - she goes down  to  the  basic,  ie,\r\n\r\nshooting,  although  defences and new technology  involve\r\n\r\nmore  than  that - and whether in real combat, our  NSmen\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to take on the regular soldiers of  other\r\n\r\narmed  forces.   She also wanted to know  how  our  NSmen\r\n\r\nfare,  in  comparison with other armed forces,  in  joint\r\n\r\nexercises.   I  assured her, based on my knowledge,  that\r\n\r\nall  is  well and our troops are well-equipped and  well-trained  for their tasks.  But it is better to hear  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister, from the horse's mouth, so to speak, on the\r\n\r\nstate of readiness of our armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bali bombings of 12th October 2002 have\r\n\r\nsuggested that regional terrorist organisations are  both\r\n\r\nwilling  and well able to mount sophisticated attacks  on\r\n\r\nsoft  targets  in the region.  It is therefore  incumbent\r\n\r\nupon  governments  in the region to do  their  utmost  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   every  potential  target   within   their\r\n\r\nterritories is hardened so as to deter terrorist  attack.\r\n\r\nEvery  attack that succeeds will only play into the hands\r\n\r\nof  the  terrorists  as it would send  off  a  signal  to\r\n\r\nforeign investors that South-east Asia is not safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If foreign investors pull out, the region, which is\r\n\r\nstill recovering from the financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncrisis  of  1997/1998,  will be in even  deeper  trouble.\r\n\r\nUnemployment   will  continue  to  be  a   big   problem,\r\n\r\nespecially in the less well-off countries, and this would\r\n\r\nonly  prod more restless, embittered young men  into  the\r\n\r\narms of the extremists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, while it is certainly important to expand\r\n\r\nsufficient resources on tightening border and immigration\r\n\r\ncontrols,   cutting  terrorist  funding   and   improving\r\n\r\nintelligence  flow  and exchanges  between  domestic  and\r\n\r\nfriendly  foreign  agencies,  it  is  more  important,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, to deal with the root cause of terrorism in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also clear that the governments in the region\r\n\r\nmust take care not to engage in any policy behaviour that\r\n\r\ninadvertently  sends out the message  that  a  particular\r\n\r\nreligion,   in  this  case,  Islam,  is  being  targeted.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  some people may become vulnerable to  radical\r\n\r\nappeals  suggesting that they have to  take  up  arms  to\r\n\r\ndefend  their  faith.  Eradicating the radical  terrorist\r\n\r\nthreat  will  require  more  than  just  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nmeasures.  A coordinated strategy integrating enforcement\r\n\r\nmeasures,   as   well   as   economic,   political    and\r\n\r\nideologically elements, therefore, is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of countering terrorism, the Bali\r\n\r\nbombings  have prodded the Indonesian Government  to  get\r\n\r\noff the fence with respect to groups like the JI.  It can\r\n\r\nno  longer  pretend that the problem with terrorism  does\r\n\r\nnot  exist  in  Indonesia and that  Indonesians  are  not\r\n\r\ninvolved with the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the attacks in the United States on 11th\r\n\r\nSeptember 2001, efforts have been increased to coordinate\r\n\r\nregional  and international actions against terrorism  in\r\n\r\nSouth-east   Asia.   ASEAN   has   announced    increased\r\n\r\ncooperation   at  its  annual  Ministerial   Meeting   in\r\n\r\nJuly/August  2002.   During these  meetings,  the  United\r\n\r\nStates also signed an anti-terrorism agreement with ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers on 30th July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I wish to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nwe have adequate intelligence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooperation on terrorism with our neighbours.  I wish  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether the backbone of JI in the region\r\n\r\nhas  been  broken,  and how successful  is  our  national\r\n\r\nsecurity secretariat in its work in countering terrorism.\r\n\r\nFurther, I wish to ask the Minister whether SAF  is  able\r\n\r\nto  deal  with terrorist attacks, including chemical  and\r\n\r\nbiological attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the SAF has participated in\r\n\r\nvarious UN peace-keeping missions.  Recently, such peace-keeping missions have become larger and larger in  scale.\r\n\r\nThe  biggest  mission  so far is to Timor-Leste  or  East\r\n\r\nTimor.  Sir, I had the opportunity to visit our troops at\r\n\r\nour  peace-keeping mission in Timor-Leste.   I  must  say\r\n\r\nthat I am impressed with the enthusiasm and commitment of\r\n\r\nour  soldiers and airmen.  However, there are reports  of\r\n\r\noutbreaks  of  violence  there. Although  this  does  not\r\n\r\npresage  a  general breakdown of the new state,  it  does\r\n\r\nremind us that the road to building a viable nation state\r\n\r\nis  an  arduous one.  In any case, peace-keeping missions\r\n\r\nare  temporary and that sometime in the near  future,  we\r\n\r\nshould complete our mission in Timor-Leste and bring back\r\n\r\nour  troops.  I would therefore ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthere  are  any other plans in the future of sending  any\r\n\r\nother  mission  under  US  auspices,  and  what  are  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  the  SAF and Singapore of  such  UN  peace-keeping missions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not here.

The\r\n\r\ncomments and views expressed by the hon. Members  reflect\r\n\r\nhow   well   Singaporeans  realise  that   our   security\r\n\r\nenvironment is a difficult and uncertain one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From global developments, to the regional situation,\r\n\r\nto our homeland, there\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  forces  at  work  which could have  a  destabilising\r\n\r\neffect   on  Singapore's  security.   At  this  time   of\r\n\r\ngeopolitical  flux,  we  must  put  enough   effort   and\r\n\r\nresources into enhancing our defence, if we do  not  want\r\n\r\nto put Singapore's security at risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a general expectation that there will\r\n\r\nsoon  be  a war in Iraq. Such a war will not only  change\r\n\r\nthe  face of the Middle East, but it will also have  far-reaching ramifications for the whole world.  For us,  one\r\n\r\ncore issue is that weapons of mass destruction should not\r\n\r\nbe allowed to proliferate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar danger looms in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\nHere,  it  is  not  just the prospect of a  nuclear-armed\r\n\r\nNorth  Korea  but the impact of this on the  geopolitical\r\n\r\nlandscape  in the whole Asia-Pacific region, as  the  US,\r\n\r\nChina  and  Japan respond to developments in  the  Korean\r\n\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These geopolitical developments at the global level\r\n\r\nwill   have   consequences  for  the  regional   security\r\n\r\nenvironment and Singapore's strategic interests. We  have\r\n\r\nlimited influence on the policies and actions of the  big\r\n\r\npowers.   But  we can enhance our security by  developing\r\n\r\ncooperative  and  mutually beneficial relationships  with\r\n\r\nthose  countries  which share common strategic  interests\r\n\r\nwith  Singapore,  as well as by drawing  the  heavyweight\r\n\r\ncountries  into  playing a more active  and  constructive\r\n\r\nrole in multi-lateral forums which can help stabilise the\r\n\r\nregional  security  environment, eg, the  ASEAN  Regional\r\n\r\nForum (ARF).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our region, serious political and economic\r\n\r\nchallenges which have beset some countries have yet to be\r\n\r\nresolved.   Economic problems will take some time  to  be\r\n\r\nsorted  out,  as  domestic  factors  are  compounded   by\r\n\r\nexternal  factors such as the US economy and  a  possible\r\n\r\nwar in the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Political stability will depend, to some extent, on\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not socio-economic conditions  improve.   So\r\n\r\nlong   as   political  and  economic  conditions   remain\r\n\r\ndifficult, there is an increased risk of low intensity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconflicts erupting, with consequent destabilising effects\r\n\r\non the rest of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prospect of elections and leadership transitions\r\n\r\ncould  also  have an impact on political  stability.   In\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   there  will  be  a  more  heated   political\r\n\r\natmosphere, as parties and presidential aspirants  jostle\r\n\r\nin  the  run-up to the elections next year.  In Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthere has also been talk of early general elections,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  general expectation of a leadership transition\r\n\r\nthis October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to emphasise that Singapore wants good\r\n\r\nrelations with all our neighbours.  But we should not  be\r\n\r\nsurprised if, at a time of political changes and economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  there  are those who find  it  politically\r\n\r\nadvantageous to raise the Singapore bogey.  We  have  had\r\n\r\nsome  taste  of  this recently, with  attempts  to  paint\r\n\r\nSingapore as unreasonable and greedy, accompanied by wild\r\n\r\nallegations in a media campaign to whip up anti-Singapore\r\n\r\nfeelings.  Even the word \"war\" and the threat of war have\r\n\r\nbeen bandied about irresponsibly by some politicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past year-and-a-half, we have also faced\r\n\r\nthe real and present threat of terrorism in our homeland.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans know how serious the threat is.  The  arrest\r\n\r\nof  the Jemaah Islamiyah members has dealt a serious blow\r\n\r\nto the network in Singapore, but terrorism is an enemy we\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to underestimate.  The Al Qaeda  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen destroyed.  Nor has the Al Qaeda given up its war of\r\n\r\nterror.   We  will  have to grapple with  the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism for years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, there are many challenges and\r\n\r\nuncertainties in our security environment.  It is against\r\n\r\nthis  background that we have to consider our budget  for\r\n\r\ndefence,  a subject raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung,  Mr  Sin\r\n\r\nBoon  Ann, Mr Ravindran and Mr Low Thia Khiang.  In these\r\n\r\ndifficult times, Members are naturally concerned that the\r\n\r\nfunds  allocated  for defence are spent wisely  and  with\r\n\r\ncare  to  ensure that we get the maximum value for  every\r\n\r\ndollar  spent on defence.  I want to assure Members  that\r\n\r\nthe Government and the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefence  are  very  conscious of the need  to  scrutinise\r\n\r\ncarefully  every area of our defence spending  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no wastage or unnecessary expenditure  of\r\n\r\nour hard-earned funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word about transparency of defence spending, a\r\n\r\nsubject raised by Mr Low Thia Khiang yesterday.   By  its\r\n\r\nvery  nature, defence procurement and SAF operations  are\r\n\r\nnot  subjects  which  can  be opened  for  discussion  in\r\n\r\npublic.  Doing so will compromise our security.  And  for\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  MINDEF  has always  kept  details  of  its\r\n\r\nspending  secret, and this is the practice in many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  This policy has worked and there is no reason\r\n\r\nto change it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the context of the security environment,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have outlined, adequate spending on defence  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  optional  priority for the Government.   Nor  is\r\n\r\nadequate  spending on defence just a desirable objective.\r\n\r\nFor  Singapore,  adequate  spending  on  defence  is   an\r\n\r\nabsolute necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security is the basic foundation on which we sustain\r\n\r\nour  nationhood  and  build Singapore's  future.  Without\r\n\r\nsecurity,  there  can  be  no  economic  development   or\r\n\r\npolitical   stability.   There   will   be   no   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments,  for  who  will want  to  put  money  in  an\r\n\r\ninsecure  small  country.  And, most critically  of  all,\r\n\r\nwithout security, Singaporeans will have no confidence in\r\n\r\nour  future.   Simply put, without a strong and  credible\r\n\r\nSAF, there is no Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this light that I listened with\r\n\r\nastonishment to Mr Chandra Mohan's thoughts  on  defence,\r\n\r\nmilitary  spending  and  global peace  and  harmony.   Mr\r\n\r\nChandra  Mohan argues essentially that the less we  spend\r\n\r\non  the  military, the greater could be  the  chances  of\r\n\r\npeace.   Sir, the real world is quite different from  the\r\n\r\nrosy picture drawn by Mr Chandra Mohan.  The fact of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  is, no matter how much we may wish it to  be  so,\r\n\r\nless   military  spending  does  not  mean  more   peace.\r\n\r\nAdequate  defence  spending is the insurance  premium  we\r\n\r\nhave to pay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  peace.  We have to invest in defence so that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot need to go to war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing more tempting to a potential\r\n\r\naggressor  than a soft and easy target.  If we are  weak,\r\n\r\nthose  who want to impose their will on us may be tempted\r\n\r\nto go beyond spouting the rhetoric of war to actually try\r\n\r\nto  use military force to subjugate us or prevent us from\r\n\r\npursuing  our national interests.  If we want  peace,  we\r\n\r\nhave to prepare for war.  This is the basis of our policy\r\n\r\nof   deterrence.   We  best  avoid  war  not  by   merely\r\n\r\nadvocating love and peace but by deterring those who  may\r\n\r\nhave  aggressive  designs  on our  security,  territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity  and national interests.  Potential  aggressors\r\n\r\nmust  know  that  the  cost of any  military  adventurism\r\n\r\nagainst Singapore would be too high for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me make one point clear. Singapore is not\r\n\r\nlooking  for  a  fight with anyone. We have  put  a  high\r\n\r\npriority   on   developing   cooperation   and   mutually\r\n\r\nbeneficial relations with the countries around  us.   And\r\n\r\nwe  have every interest in seeing our neighbours do well,\r\n\r\nbecause  an economically thriving and politically  stable\r\n\r\nregion  is  important for Singapore's  own  security  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore desires friendly and cooperative relations\r\n\r\nwith   all  countries  in  our  region.   But  such  good\r\n\r\nrelations must be based on the fundamental principle that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a sovereign nation with our  own  national\r\n\r\ninterests to safeguard and to promote.  Having a credible\r\n\r\ndefence  capability ensures that we will  not  be  pushed\r\n\r\naround.  The SAF gives us the space to pursue Singapore's\r\n\r\nown best interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF has been systematically built up over\r\n\r\nmore than three decades.  Developing a defence capability\r\n\r\ntakes  careful,  long-term planning and  investment.   It\r\n\r\nrequires  a  strong  and steady commitment.   It  is  not\r\n\r\npossible to build up significant defence capabilities  at\r\n\r\nshort   notice.    We   cannot   develop   our   military\r\n\r\ncapabilities  in  a coherent manner and  plan  and  spend\r\n\r\nprudently if we adopt a feast-and-famine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach, where we spend only in good years and cut  back\r\n\r\ndrastically in bad years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security threats can appear much more quickly than\r\n\r\nit  takes  to develop the capability to deal  with  them.\r\n\r\nThe  steady  commitment  of the Singapore  Government  to\r\n\r\ndeveloping our defence capability, and the support  which\r\n\r\nSingaporeans give to this, have not escaped the notice of\r\n\r\nothers.   It  is  as much our military  hardware  as  the\r\n\r\ncommitment  of the Government and our people to  ensuring\r\n\r\nSingapore's security that underpin our deterrence policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, deterrence is one pillar of our defence policy.\r\n\r\nThe  second pillar is diplomacy, a subject raised  by  Dr\r\n\r\nOng  Chit  Chung  and  Mr Ravindran.   Singapore  desires\r\n\r\nfriendship   and   cooperation  with   other   countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly those which share common strategic interests\r\n\r\nwith  us.  MINDEF therefore puts significant efforts into\r\n\r\ndeveloping defence relations.  This pays off in terms  of\r\n\r\nenhancing our security in a number of ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have interactions with armed forces and defence\r\n\r\nestablishments in our own region and all over the  world.\r\n\r\nThese include military exercises, military-to-military as\r\n\r\nwell  as  policy discussions, interaction  programmes  at\r\n\r\nvarious levels, and cross-attendance of military training\r\n\r\ncourses.   The  SAF has access to training facilities  in\r\n\r\nabout  a dozen countries.  At the multilateral level,  we\r\n\r\nconduct land, naval and air exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these interactions not only help to develop\r\n\r\nfriendship and mutual understanding and confidence,  they\r\n\r\nalso   offer   benefits  in  terms  of  the  professional\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our servicemen, including  our  National\r\n\r\nServicemen who participate in these exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training and exercising with advanced militaries,\r\n\r\nfor example, the various services of the US armed forces,\r\n\r\nallow the SAF to benchmark itself against the best in the\r\n\r\nworld.   The fact that advanced armed forces are keen  to\r\n\r\nexpand the scope and complexity of their military\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercises  with the SAF, reflects their high  regard  for\r\n\r\nthe  professionalism  of the SAF.  Our  cooperation  with\r\n\r\nforeign  armed  forces also allows for collaborations  in\r\n\r\ndefence    technology,   and   we   have   had   fruitful\r\n\r\ncollaborations  with countries such as  the  US,  France,\r\n\r\nSweden and Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked whether MINDEF has\r\n\r\nenough  resources  to  tackle both conventional  military\r\n\r\nthreats and low intensity conflicts or LICs.  He has also\r\n\r\nasked about our efforts to combat terrorism.  Dr Ong  has\r\n\r\nzeroed in on the critical issue of security, and that is,\r\n\r\nthe  spectrum of threats, and potential threats that face\r\n\r\nSingapore,  has  expanded.  This is one important  reason\r\n\r\nwhy we are seeking an increased budget for defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 11th September 2001, MINDEF and our other\r\n\r\nsecurity agencies, as well as non-security agencies which\r\n\r\nprovide expertise to deal with the wide range of LIC  and\r\n\r\nterrorist  threats,  have been working  hard  to  quickly\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  capabilities to  deal  with  such  threats.\r\n\r\nThese  are  fundamentally different in  nature  from  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  challenges that we have had to  tackle  in  the\r\n\r\npast.  Global catastrophic terrorism, in particular, is a\r\n\r\ncomplex  threat  which impacts on all dimensions  of  our\r\n\r\nnational life.  The target is not just our security,  but\r\n\r\nalso our economy and the fabric of our society.  And  the\r\n\r\nthreat  is constant.  It is sustained.  Our response  has\r\n\r\nto   be  multi-faceted,  and  it  must  be  coherent  and\r\n\r\nintegrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In counter-terrorism, the effort has to be a multi-agency one, not only because of the multi-dimensional\r\n\r\nnature of the threat but also because this allows  us  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  our  limited national resources.  The  National\r\n\r\nSecurity Secretariat, which is an inter-agency department\r\n\r\nlocated  in  MINDEF to coordinate this effort,  has  made\r\n\r\nsignificant  progress in all three areas  of  prevention,\r\n\r\nprotection and consequence management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of prevention, intelligence is critical\r\n\r\nand  we  have  had  good cooperation  with  our  regional\r\n\r\ncountries.   One of the most significant results  yielded\r\n\r\nby this cooperation with our neighbours was the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narrest  of  Mas  Selamet  Kastari,  the  leader  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore JI group.  The JI here has been crippled  after\r\n\r\nthe  arrest  of its members, but the threat of  terrorism\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  eradicated and we  cannot  afford  to  be\r\n\r\ncomplacent.  We have to harden our defences so that we do\r\n\r\nnot  offer  tempting targets.  And all Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nhave to remain alert and vigilant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by saying that we are living in\r\n\r\nuncertain  times.   Singapore is more vulnerable  to  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  the external environment than  most  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   We  now have to grapple with  new  and  more\r\n\r\ncomplex  threats  even  as we  have  to  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  conventional  threats.   The  spectrum  of\r\n\r\nthreats  has  expanded  and  we  must  have  the  defence\r\n\r\ncapabilities to deal with the whole range of  threats  if\r\n\r\nwe  want to ensure Singapore's security.  The demands  on\r\n\r\nour security apparatus have grown significantly.  We have\r\n\r\nto  grapple with more issues.  We have to build  up  more\r\n\r\ncapabilities.  We have to develop more systems.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  conduct more activities.  And we have to  do  all  of\r\n\r\nthese  within  the limits of our manpower, including  our\r\n\r\nNational Service resources.  These heavier demands on our\r\n\r\nsecurity  system  will continue for some  time  to  come,\r\n\r\ngiven  that  the security environment in  our  region  is\r\n\r\nunlikely to improve significantly for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, to reiterate, security is the most\r\n\r\nbasic  requirement for our survival and continued success\r\n\r\nas  a  nation.  The Singapore Armed Forces and our  other\r\n\r\nsecurity agencies must have the hardware and systems, and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  have the commitment  and  resolve  to\r\n\r\nensure Singapore's security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dealt with most of the points raised by\r\n\r\nMembers.   The  other points will be  dealt  with  by  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues in the Defence Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong has already gone on a peace\r\n\r\nmission.

While most of these events happened\r\n\r\nin  other  countries, we often feel their ripple effects,\r\n\r\nespecially  when some of these happened so close  to  our\r\n\r\nhomes.  In a global village, everyone has a role to  play\r\n\r\nin  maintaining  peace and order.  I am pleased  to  note\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is an active participant  in  UN  peace-keeping  missions.  Such missions not  only  provide  our\r\n\r\nservicemen   with   invaluable  opportunities   to   gain\r\n\r\nfrontline  experience and build up confidence, they  also\r\n\r\nensure    Singapore's   presence   and   commitment    to\r\n\r\ninternational and regional peace and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that SAF personnel have been\r\n\r\ninvolved in peace-keeping missions for the past 12 years.\r\n\r\nThis  is  certainly  an impressive track  record,  and  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that in this period, more than 900 personnel,\r\n\r\nif   not  more,  have  been  deployed  in  various  peace\r\n\r\nmissions.  The duration of such missions, as I understand\r\n\r\nit,  is, on average, about a year.  I would like to raise\r\n\r\ntwo concerns that I have in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, is on the issue of the mental health of SAF\r\n\r\npersonnel who have gone for such missions.  Studies of US\r\n\r\nmilitary personnel deployed to peace-keeping missions  in\r\n\r\nplaces  such  as Somalia and Bosnia found  that  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  personnel  were  at risk of post-traumatic  stress\r\n\r\ndisorder (or PTSD), having been exposed to stresses  like\r\n\r\nwitnessing   the  aftermath  of  death  and  destruction,\r\n\r\nobserving sufferings and experiencing stress about peace-keeping  duties.    Sir, my questions are: what  are  the\r\n\r\nprocesses  that these personnel were made to  go  through\r\n\r\nbefore  and  after their peace missions  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntheir  mental  health needs are met?  Have any  of  these\r\n\r\npersonnel shown any signs of PTSD, and, if so,  what  has\r\n\r\nbeen done to assist them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second concern I have, Sir, is with regard to\r\n\r\nthe welfare of families\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof personnel deployed in peace-keeping missions.  Another\r\n\r\nstudy  involving  Australian military personnel  sent  to\r\n\r\npeace-keeping missions highlighted the need for care  and\r\n\r\nconsideration  to be given to families  of  personnel  or\r\n\r\nindividuals on deployment.  Deployment of personnel is  a\r\n\r\nvery stressful time for families.  If personnel return to\r\n\r\ndifficult  family  situations, they  are  potentially  at\r\n\r\ngreater risk of developing chronic trauma symptoms.   The\r\n\r\nstudy  also  found that good social support is  a  strong\r\n\r\nfactor   in   preventing  the  development  of  traumatic\r\n\r\nsymptoms.  My questions in this regard are: what is being\r\n\r\ndone  to  support families of personnel  sent  to  peace-keeping   missions?    How  are  families   assisted   in\r\n\r\nunderstanding and supporting their members who have  gone\r\n\r\nto  these peace-keeping missions to ease transition  when\r\n\r\nthey  return home?  And have such personnel faced  family\r\n\r\nproblems  upon their return from such missions?   If  so,\r\n\r\nwhat is being done to assist them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise the value of such peace-keeping missions\r\n\r\nhave  on  Singapore  as  a country.   I  think  there  is\r\n\r\ntremendous value for these individuals too.  However,  if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  pay  attention to the  above  issues,  these\r\n\r\nbenefits  may be easily challenged with negative  effects\r\n\r\nand  they  may end up being more costly to the personnel,\r\n\r\ntheir families, and Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, you can take both cuts\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, my apologies for the\r\n\r\nmistake earlier and the incursions, which are unintended,\r\n\r\nunlike  the  Malaysians' incursions into our  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters at Pedra Branca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysian vessels continue to intrude into our\r\n\r\nterritorial   waters,  despite  Singapore  and   Malaysia\r\n\r\ncommitting  the issue of Pedra Branca for ruling  at  the\r\n\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask the Minister whether our Navy will\r\n\r\nincrease  its patrols in our territorial waters at  Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca.

We were told that investigations are  still\r\n\r\nin progress.  But much time has passed, and we wonder why\r\n\r\nthere   is   such   a  long  delay  in   completing   the\r\n\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many unanswered questions. For\r\n\r\nexample, how did the accident occur when both crews  were\r\n\r\naware  that  the  ships  were on a  collision  path?   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  the crew of RSS Courageous had  sighted  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  ship on its radar and also through  its  duty\r\n\r\nwatch officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question uppermost in the minds of many is whether\r\n\r\nthe   accident  reflects  and  affects  the   operational\r\n\r\nreadiness  of  the Navy.  Further, what are  the  lessons\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  draw  from this accident,  and  are  these\r\n\r\nlessons  being  followed up and internalised  within  the\r\n\r\nNavy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my opinion, it is best to complete the\r\n\r\ninvestigations speedily.

And  if  it  was  a systemic  error,  would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry give us an assurance that such an incident  will\r\n\r\nnot  happen  again?

The immediate response  of  the\r\n\r\nNavy  in  searching  for the bodies  of  those  who  were\r\n\r\nmissing  and  in  giving much emotional  support  to  the\r\n\r\nfamilies was the correct thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that passage of seaway is an extremely busy\r\n\r\none.

I  recall  that  in\r\n\r\nJanuary,  when this matter was raised in the  House,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  told  us that the Maritime and  Port  Authority\r\n\r\nwould  finish its investigations by the end  of  January.\r\n\r\nBut  until now, we have heard nothing.  We were also told\r\n\r\nthat  the  findings would be made public and that  MINDEF\r\n\r\nwould also conduct its own board of inquiry.  May I  also\r\n\r\nask whether MINDEF's findings would be made public?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>11.45 am\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that investigations of this nature have\r\n\r\nto  be  very  thorough.

This is to help prepare  them\r\n\r\nto  handle any situation that they might face.  They  are\r\n\r\nalso  given  psychological counselling,  both  for  their\r\n\r\nmission  and for their long period of absence from  home.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  MINDEF has a comprehensive support  system\r\n\r\nfor  the  families  of the servicemen.  Liaison  officers\r\n\r\nmake regular home visits and assist the families, and the\r\n\r\nfamilies can also call hotlines when they need assistance\r\n\r\nor  information.

We will continue to  do  so  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   Singapore's   sovereignty   and   territorial\r\n\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures we have in place and the various\r\n\r\ncontingency plans that we have are adequate to deal  with\r\n\r\nviolations of our sovereignty in the waters around  Pedra\r\n\r\nBranca by Malaysian state vessels.  While Malaysian state\r\n\r\nvessels  have  not always complied immediately  with  our\r\n\r\ninstructions to leave,  they do leave eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia and Singapore have signed a Special\r\n\r\nAgreement  on  6th  February to refer  the  Pedra  Branca\r\n\r\ndispute  to  the  International Court of Justice  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  both allow the legal process to take its  course.\r\n\r\nIt  is  unfortunate that Malaysian naval vessels continue\r\n\r\nto  violate  our territorial waters around Pedra  Branca,\r\n\r\neven though the Malaysian government knows full well that\r\n\r\nthis  will  not  advance their case in the  International\r\n\r\nCourt  of Justice.  Such violations could lead to a tense\r\n\r\nsituation  on  the  ground  and  increase  the  risk   of\r\n\r\nunintended incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr Tan\r\n\r\nSoo  Khoon have asked about the collision between the RSS\r\n\r\nCourageous and ANL Indonesia. Sir, MINDEF had convened  a\r\n\r\nBoard   of   Inquiry  into  the  collision  between   RSS\r\n\r\nCourageous  and the merchant vessel, ANL Indonesia.   The\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Inquiry has completed its work and MINDEF  has\r\n\r\nprovided a summary of the Board of Inquiry's findings  to\r\n\r\nthe  Coroner to facilitate the Coroner's Inquiry.  MINDEF\r\n\r\nhas  also  fully  cooperated with the Maritime  and  Port\r\n\r\nAuthority in its investigation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  the accident.  The MPA's investigation report  will\r\n\r\nbe  released in due course.  I do not expect that it will\r\n\r\ntake  very much longer.  That will contain a full account\r\n\r\nof the events leading up to the collision.  Let me assure\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House that MINDEF, the SAF and the  Navy\r\n\r\nare  also  as interested as Members here in finding  out,\r\n\r\ngetting  to  the bottom of this collision, learning  from\r\n\r\nthe lessons and moving on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crew of RSS Courageous has undergone counselling\r\n\r\nand   assessment   to   prepare  them   for   operational\r\n\r\ndeployment.  In addition, RSN has re-examined its  safety\r\n\r\npractices  and  shipboard  safety  procedures  have  been\r\n\r\nreinforced.    The   RSN   has   also   re-examined   its\r\n\r\nprofessional training systems, and steps have been  taken\r\n\r\nto  further enhance the training and qualification system\r\n\r\nfor  Officers of the Watch.  Sir, morale in the RSN  was,\r\n\r\nof  course, affected by this accident.  But the RSN is  a\r\n\r\nstrong family and our people have recovered, learnt  from\r\n\r\nthe  tragic incident and moved on.  They are, after  all,\r\n\r\nfully  aware  of  the  onerous and potentially  dangerous\r\n\r\nnature  of military duty, and they know that they have  a\r\n\r\njob  to  do.   The  men and women of the Navy  are  fully\r\n\r\nprofessional,  and the Navy's operational  readiness  was\r\n\r\nnot affected by this accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the men and women of the SAF dedicate their\r\n\r\nlives  to the service of our nation.  The tragic loss  of\r\n\r\nour  four servicewomen in the collision of RSS Courageous\r\n\r\nis  a sad reminder of how those who serve in the SAF work\r\n\r\nunder  tough  and,  sometimes,  dangerous  conditions  to\r\n\r\nprotect  Singapore's security.  The Navy  plays  a  vital\r\n\r\nrole in the defence of Singapore and will continue to  do\r\n\r\nso  with  full  dedication and the  highest  professional\r\n\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the SAF is a small National\r\n\r\nService  armed  force.

Towards this end, we should spare  no\r\n\r\neffort  in  allowing  our young human  resource  as  much\r\n\r\nopportunity  as  possible  to  strengthen.    Our   fresh\r\n\r\ngraduates today face very severe competition in  the  job\r\n\r\nmarket, reportedly the worst ever in the last five years.\r\n\r\nThe percentage of the fresh graduates not able to find  a\r\n\r\njob  after graduation has grown by close to 10%  year  on\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that while we open our economy and\r\n\r\njob market to foreign talents, we need to remove some  of\r\n\r\nthe measures that blunt the competitive edge of our young\r\n\r\nhuman  resource pool.  Our young graduates are not facing\r\n\r\nonly  competition in the local job market  on  an  uneven\r\n\r\nplaying field, but also worldwide.  The size of China and\r\n\r\nIndia's   populations  allows  them  to  produce   bright\r\n\r\nprofessionals in abundance.  They have an edge  over  our\r\n\r\ngraduates because they join the workforce earlier as they\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  to do national service.  Age to  age,  the\r\n\r\ngraduates  in  these countries would have some  years  of\r\n\r\nworking experience versus our own fresh graduates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of mandatory conscription, we are amongst\r\n\r\nthe  minority in the world.  I had moved this issue  last\r\n\r\nyear  and  am raising it again this year, as the Minister\r\n\r\nhad  responded  last  year that  the  Ministry  would  be\r\n\r\nrelooking into the period of national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the smallness of our population would dictate\r\n\r\nthat  our defence philosophy and strategy are not  solely\r\n\r\ndependent  on size.  Throughout history, there  are  many\r\n\r\nexamples  of  military contests when numeric  superiority\r\n\r\ndoes  not dictate the outcome.  This is especially so  in\r\n\r\nthe  present day where threats are from terrorist groups,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  JI  and  the  Al  Qaeda.   Unlike  conventional\r\n\r\nthreats,  terrorist groups operate in the  dark.   It  is\r\n\r\nalmost similar to that of guerilla warfare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand,  hence,  keeping large armies  is  no  guarantee  of\r\n\r\nstrength or security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am thus asking the Minister for Defence to\r\n\r\nexpeditiously, with the timetable, review the  length  of\r\n\r\nnational   service   for  our  young   and   shorten   it\r\n\r\nappropriately  and deliver a compact training  period  to\r\n\r\ndevelop our defence force instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Ser Miang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, National\r\n\r\nService  is  the duty that our sons undertake with  pride\r\n\r\nand  honour.   It  is an essential part of  our  military\r\n\r\ndefence.   Our  national sportsmen, on  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\ncontribute  to  our  psychological  and  social  defence.\r\n\r\nWhenever they won, and when our national flag was  raised\r\n\r\nand  Majullah  Singapura was played, pride,  passion  and\r\n\r\npatriotism surged through us and we cheered for  them  as\r\n\r\none   people  and  one  nation  regardless  of  race  and\r\n\r\nreligion.  With the understanding and accommodation  made\r\n\r\nby  the Ministry of Defence, it has been possible for our\r\n\r\nnational sportsmen doing NS to train and compete for  our\r\n\r\nnation  without compromising the standard and demands  of\r\n\r\nNational Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12.00 noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would say that national sportsmen doing NS\r\n\r\nhas  a  special role to play in addition to  doing  their\r\n\r\nmilitary service.  Winning for Singapore whilst doing  NS\r\n\r\nnot  only brings pride and joy to our nation, family  and\r\n\r\nto  oneself,  it  also  serves as a  morale  booster  and\r\n\r\ninspiration  to the section, platoon, company,  battalion\r\n\r\nand  to  all NSmen, and inspire them to want to do  their\r\n\r\nbest for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, like Oliver Twist, I am asking for more. I am\r\n\r\nasking  the  Ministry  to  recognise  the  value  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  sportsmen in NS, and allow  them  even  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility for them to excel for Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, reservists have a\r\n\r\nduty to the nation during reserve ICT, which they fulfill\r\n\r\ngladly.  However, as they progress in their careers, they\r\n\r\nalso  face  increasing demands on  their  time  from  the\r\n\r\nfamilies and jobs.  I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nam  glad  that  MINDEF has been moving towards  a  system\r\n\r\nwhereby experienced reservists who have performed well in\r\n\r\ntheir  individual units have been allowed to move towards\r\n\r\nindividualised  training  for upkeep  of  their  military\r\n\r\nskills,  rather  than having to take part in  large-scale\r\n\r\nICT all the time.  This is a move in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reservists go into in-camp training, I am also\r\n\r\nglad  to note that the administration of in-camp training\r\n\r\nhas  been much improved, and the morale of servicemen  is\r\n\r\noften  very  high.   I  had  the  privilege  recently  of\r\n\r\nobserving a live-firing exercise in New Zealand.  Despite\r\n\r\nhaving  had  to put up with cold and windy conditions  in\r\n\r\nthe field, the camaraderie, esprit de corps and morale of\r\n\r\nthe   servicemen  concerned  were  very  high,  as  their\r\n\r\ntechnical  proficiency and standards.  This is  all  very\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also hope that the SAF would do more to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  administration and in-processing  speed  of\r\n\r\nreservists  when  they come for recall  manning,  because\r\n\r\ndespite this being more low key, reservists also have  to\r\n\r\ndrop  everything, get their uniforms and go back to camp.\r\n\r\nThey  answer the call of the nation.  I think it behooves\r\n\r\nthe  organisations  also  to  make  sure  that  they  are\r\n\r\nspeedily in-processed and are able to turn out into their\r\n\r\nfighting units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Although their\r\n\r\nnumbers are relatively small, women have made their  mark\r\n\r\nas  regulars in the SAF.  In the last five years, we have\r\n\r\nat least two female naval officers who commanded ships in\r\n\r\nthe  Navy,  a woman commanding officer in the  artillery,\r\n\r\nand several women who command RSAF squadrons.  Whenever I\r\n\r\nmeet such women officers, I can feel their sense of pride\r\n\r\nin,  first, serving their country and, second, in  rising\r\n\r\nto  their positions in a male-dominated field.  They take\r\n\r\ntheir  professions  and  their cause  of  protecting  the\r\n\r\ncountry very seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they did not make much of their achievements as\r\n\r\nwomen  because,  as far as they are concerned,  they  are\r\n\r\nthere on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  own  merits, and they want to be judged  by  their\r\n\r\nmale  counterparts and the country on the basis of  their\r\n\r\nown abilities, leadership qualities and contributions  to\r\n\r\nSAF.   They  work very hard to prove themselves  on  this\r\n\r\nbasis.   Their attitude is commendable.  But I also  know\r\n\r\nthat  it  has been a challenge for the women regulars  to\r\n\r\novercome   some   biases  and  mindsets   towards   them,\r\n\r\nespecially given this patriarchal society and their male-dominated working environment.  They take this  in  their\r\n\r\nstride, but we need not make it harder for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fewer than one in 10 SAF regulars are women.\r\n\r\nBut  whatever their numbers - as is made clear  with  the\r\n\r\nrecent tragedy of RSS Courageous which took the lives  of\r\n\r\nfour  Navy servicewomen - women face the same dangers  as\r\n\r\nmen  while  on  professional duty.  Hence,  they  deserve\r\n\r\nequal recognition and respect as the men in the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we look at the MINDEF website, we will\r\n\r\nfind   a   video   clip   of   the   Army's   recruitment\r\n\r\nadvertisements, one for men and one for  women,  and  the\r\n\r\ncontrast  between them cannot be greater.  For  the  clip\r\n\r\ntitled  \"Woman Officer\", it shows a sexy woman  strutting\r\n\r\nin  very  short  shorts in a halter top with  an  exposed\r\n\r\nmidriff,  with  a  silky tune playing in the  background.\r\n\r\nShe  gives sultry looks to a man - I think a male officer\r\n\r\n-  and  as  she walks away, these words appear: \"A  whole\r\n\r\nworld  of possibilities - Women in the Army\".  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure  what  it meant but, watching the clip, one  of  the\r\n\r\npossibilities that came readily to mind was  of  a  high-class karaoke hostess.  And, sometimes, looking at it, it\r\n\r\nlooks  more like an advertisement to recruit men than  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  women.  But when we contrast this with the  clip\r\n\r\nfor  men,  it  is studded with purposeful images  of  men\r\n\r\nscanning  maps,  looking vigilant,  serious,  courageous,\r\n\r\nprotecting Singapore, and the word \"Leadership\" appeared,\r\n\r\nand  the  clip ends with the words \"Army 21, the decisive\r\n\r\nforce\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the clip for women regulars, which I\r\n\r\nwould say is quite sexist, demeans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  serious  contribution to the SAF in  securing  the\r\n\r\ninterest of Singapore.

It\r\n\r\ncannot  be  physical  fitness  because,  for  both,   the\r\n\r\ncriteria would be that they must qualify and excel in the\r\n\r\nOfficer  Cadet  School and, for both  scholarships,  they\r\n\r\nmust  have  a strong interest in a military career.

DSO   National    Laboratory\r\n\r\nundertakes secret edge applied defence research,  and  ST\r\n\r\nEngineering has developed strong systems integration  and\r\n\r\nengineering  capabilities, and  they  have  designed  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped  such advanced weapons systems  as  the  Bionix\r\n\r\nInfantry   Fighting  Vehicle,  and  the   Endurance-class\r\n\r\nLanding Ship Tank.  All these taken together constitute a\r\n\r\nsignificant   and   sustainable  advantage   in   defence\r\n\r\ntechnology for our armed forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF, naturally, has also leveraged on the\r\n\r\ncapabilities  of  other organisations in  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nroutinely tap the expertise in Temasek laboratories,  the\r\n\r\nresearch institutes, and the talents in NUS, NTU and  the\r\n\r\npolytechnics  for less sensitive work.   Local  companies\r\n\r\nand start-ups that can offer innovative solutions for the\r\n\r\nSAF operations also receive MINDEF funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked about Singapore's participation in the\r\n\r\nJSF programme.  Our participation in this programme as  a\r\n\r\nsecurity  cooperation participant gives  Singapore  early\r\n\r\naccess to operational and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntechnical  information related to the JSF.  The programme\r\n\r\naims  to  develop an advanced multi-role  new  generation\r\n\r\nstealth  fighter.  The JSF, or F35 as it is  known,  will\r\n\r\nhave  enhanced combat survivability, precision engagement\r\n\r\nand  lower  cost of maintenance.  Singapore is the  first\r\n\r\nAsian country to join the JSF programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran also asked about dual-use technology\r\n\r\nand,  where  applicable, would MINDEF  and  its  agencies\r\n\r\nexplore such dual-use technology, and the answer is  yes.\r\n\r\nDual-use technology would help reduce the overall cost of\r\n\r\ndefence  procurement, and ST Engineering  routinely  does\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chong Weng Chiew described the poor job market\r\n\r\nwhich Singapore fresh graduates are facing, and the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  our  young  male citizens have had to  do  National\r\n\r\nService  compared  to their counterparts  in  some  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  he  asked if the  length  for  full-time\r\n\r\nNational Servicemen can be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, National Service plays a vital role in\r\n\r\nsafeguarding  the security and sovereignty of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwith National Servicemen forming the backbone of the SAF.\r\n\r\nIt  is  therefore important that National Servicemen  are\r\n\r\nwell  trained, proficient and operationally  ready.   The\r\n\r\nlength of full-time National Service is determined by the\r\n\r\ntime  required  to train our National Servicemen  to  the\r\n\r\nrequired  level  of military proficiency, especially  for\r\n\r\nmilitary commanders.  They are trained not only to handle\r\n\r\ntheir  own  equipment,  but also  to  be  able  to  fight\r\n\r\neffectively   as  an  integrated  force.   Our   National\r\n\r\nServicemen have to operate at the battalion, brigade  and\r\n\r\nup  to  the  division levels.  The use of technology  and\r\n\r\nsophisticated  weapons  systems  has  given  the  SAF   a\r\n\r\ndecisive  capability edge.  But soldiers still require  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  period  of training and  familiarisation  to\r\n\r\noperate these advanced weapons systems proficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has carefully reviewed the length of full-time NS and decided that it would be prudent to maintain\r\n\r\nthe  current NS duration.  The regional security  climate\r\n\r\nremains volatile and uncertain, as many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the  House have pointed  out.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nmaintain our vigilance and ability to respond effectively\r\n\r\nto a wide range of security threats.  Reducing the length\r\n\r\nof NS would impact on the ability of our units to fulfill\r\n\r\ntheir  missions, and we cannot compromise the operational\r\n\r\nreadiness and effectiveness of the SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, MINDEF would not want Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  spend  more time than necessary for NS  duties.   For\r\n\r\nthis  reason,  enlistees who have the required  level  of\r\n\r\nphysical  fitness  do  not have to undergo  the  physical\r\n\r\ntraining phase before Basic Military Training.  Those who\r\n\r\nachieve  at  least  a  Silver Standard  in  the  National\r\n\r\nPhysical Fitness Award (NAPFA) test therefore enjoy a  2-month reduction in full-time NS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises the sacrifices that NSmen have\r\n\r\nmade  in  order  to  protect Singapore.   Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done various things  to  recognise  such\r\n\r\ncontributions by our NSmen, and these included  a  higher\r\n\r\nallocation    for   New   Singapore   Shares,    Economic\r\n\r\nRestructuring Shares, tax reliefs, as well  as  the  many\r\n\r\nSAFRA  clubs that are provided for the benefit  of  NSmen\r\n\r\nand their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support by Members in this House, as Dr Warren\r\n\r\nLee  has  pointed  out, the fact that ICT  has  improved,\r\n\r\nmorale  and  standards are high.  Such  recognition  that\r\n\r\nMembers of the House give to our National Servicemen is a\r\n\r\nlaudable one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>12.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Ser Miang asked about sportsmen in National\r\n\r\nService.  National Service is the responsibility  of  all\r\n\r\nable-bodied  male  Singaporeans, including  athletes,  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   our  nation  and  to  protect  our  families.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  MINDEF  recognises  that  enlistment   for\r\n\r\nNational  Service  can  cause  some  disruptions  to   an\r\n\r\nathlete's sports training programmes.  Hence, efforts are\r\n\r\ntaken  to minimise the impact of National Service on  the\r\n\r\nsports training of our top athletes and, at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame time, to ensure that they are adequately trained for\r\n\r\nthe  defence of the nation.  That is the primary  purpose\r\n\r\nof National Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF allows a small number of the top national\r\n\r\nsportsmen  to  train  in their respective  sports,  while\r\n\r\nundergoing   their  full-time  National   Service.    The\r\n\r\nsportsmen  must  first  complete  their  Basic   Military\r\n\r\nTraining,  Military  Leadership or  Vocational  Training.\r\n\r\nThereafter,  they would be deployed to serve in  military\r\n\r\nunits  and  they are eligible to be granted  time-off  to\r\n\r\nundergo  sports  training  and  competitions.   Full-time\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen  representing  Singapore  in   major\r\n\r\ninternational  or regional competitions  may  be  granted\r\n\r\nunrecorded leave or even disruption from National Service\r\n\r\nto participate in these events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question that always arises is how much further\r\n\r\nwe  can  do and how much more flexible MINDEF can be.  We\r\n\r\nhave also, in some instances, allowed officials, who have\r\n\r\naccompanied  such sportsmen, time-off  to  take  on  such\r\n\r\nduties.  However, it is always debatable as to the  level\r\n\r\nof  proficiency and competency of a particular sportsman.\r\n\r\nMany  claim to be a lot more able than they actually are.\r\n\r\nBearing  in  mind  that the main purpose  of  NS  is  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of the nation and military training, MINDEF  has\r\n\r\nto be selective as to who we allow such unrecorded leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Warren Lee commented on our mobilisation\r\n\r\nexercises and the fact that many of our NSmen have  full-time  careers to attend to and whether or not MINDEF  can\r\n\r\nbe  more  efficient in the In-and-Out processing of  such\r\n\r\nNSmen  when  they  come  back  for  ICT  or  mobilisation\r\n\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF recognises that a large part of such\r\n\r\ninefficiency today lies in manual processing  of  In-and-Out  processing.   MINDEF has been leveraging  on  IT  to\r\n\r\nimprove  NS  administration  in  general.   MIW.com,   an\r\n\r\nInternet  website  is  one such initiative.   It  enables\r\n\r\nNSmen  to carry out a variety of transactions with MINDEF\r\n\r\nelectronically,  such  as make-up  pay  claims,  overseas\r\n\r\nnotification and IPPT booking.  Electronic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntransactions  will  be extended to  as  many  aspects  of\r\n\r\nNational Service administration as possible.  In  respect\r\n\r\nof  call-up administration, MINDEF has been conducting  a\r\n\r\ntrial  to  administer  in/out processing  electronically.\r\n\r\nThis  will reduce processing time by up to 50%.  Once  it\r\n\r\nis  proven, the electronic in/out processing system would\r\n\r\nbe extended to all call-ups and mobilisation  exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has commented about service women in the\r\n\r\nSAF.   Indeed, service women in the SAF have  made  their\r\n\r\nmark.   They  have done well, and continue  to  do  well.\r\n\r\nMINDEF  provides  opportunities to both male  and  female\r\n\r\nmilitary  personnel in recruitment, training, advancement\r\n\r\nand,  wherever possible, deployment.  Women compete  with\r\n\r\nmen   for   scholarships,  academic  awards  and   career\r\n\r\nadvancement.   Women  have a role  in  the  SAF.   MINDEF\r\n\r\nrecognises the value that they bring to the SAF and, over\r\n\r\nthe  last  five years, we have between 2-6 service  women\r\n\r\nholding  appointments as Commanding Officers of  the  SAF\r\n\r\nunits  at  any  point  in  time.   Women  contribute   to\r\n\r\nincreasing the operational readiness of the SAF.  The SAF\r\n\r\nhas   often   depicted   its   service   women   in   its\r\n\r\nadvertisements,  posters and pamphlets.  These  publicity\r\n\r\nmaterials  raise  the overall profile  of  women  in  the\r\n\r\nservice  and  help the SAF to attract women to  join  the\r\n\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng pointed out to a certain advertisement on the\r\n\r\narmy  website  and  observed that it  may  be  sexist  in\r\n\r\nnature.  We will take a look at the website again and  if\r\n\r\nit  is so, we would make the necessary corrections.   The\r\n\r\nSAF   will  continue  to  give  its  service  women   due\r\n\r\nrecognition  and  to  educate the public  on  the  career\r\n\r\nopportunities and the significant role that women play in\r\n\r\nthe SAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Sir, I agree with my parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues that everybody's contribution matters  in  the\r\n\r\ntotal  defence of a nation, whether male or female, young\r\n\r\nor  old, and whatever roles we might play.  In a conflict\r\n\r\nthat  we are increasingly going to be seeing in the world\r\n\r\nof  tomorrow,  there may be no frontline as  such.

The lack of a front in the new types  of\r\n\r\nwarfare  means that Singapore's approach of having  total\r\n\r\ndefence is absolutely correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call upon our Government to review how we\r\n\r\ncan  improve  the  roles of the Civil  Defence  Executive\r\n\r\nCommittees and their volunteers in our heartlands to  see\r\n\r\nhow they can be better trained and how their roles can be\r\n\r\nbetter  integrated  with the roles of  our  active  civil\r\n\r\ndefence  forces, as well as the SAF forces  charged  with\r\n\r\nthe  protection of our homeland. I wonder  whether  there\r\n\r\nare  also  plans  for a larger level and a  larger  scale\r\n\r\nexercises  in the same way that the SAF built  itself  up\r\n\r\nfrom small, medium and, now, large unit exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, as I was\r\n\r\nthinking  through  what  to say  on  this  cut  on  total\r\n\r\ndefence,  I  had written down that, given  the  realities\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  and Singaporeans have  to  confront  and\r\n\r\ngrapple  with today, the message and importance of  total\r\n\r\ndefence  stands  out.  And this is  in  contrast  to  the\r\n\r\nearlier years of total defence where nobody would quarrel\r\n\r\nwith the need or comprehensiveness or far-sightedness  of\r\n\r\nthe approach but perhaps neither would many be taking  it\r\n\r\nvery  seriously  because the threat scenarios  then  were\r\n\r\nless acute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having listened to some of the views expressed\r\n\r\nby  my parliamentary colleagues on the subject of defence\r\n\r\nand  the  need  for defence, or even the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nscaling  back defence in this situation, I think  I  have\r\n\r\ntaken  too  much  for granted. What I thought  was  self-evident, that we have to have strong defence, is  not  so\r\n\r\nself-evident  after all.  I think we have to  be  careful\r\n\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are Lion City. And as any lion or lioness that\r\n\r\nhas  to  defend the interest of the pride would know,  we\r\n\r\nhave  got to be fast, we have got to be good in order  to\r\n\r\ndefend our territory because the wildebeest, the gazelle,\r\n\r\nthe  buffaloes  would  not just  walk  into  your  mouth.\r\n\r\nNeither would other prides just leave your\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nterritory  to you.  And many a weak lion would  lose  its\r\n\r\nlunch  to hyenas and sometimes, if you are sick, you  end\r\n\r\nup  as the hyena's lunch.  That is a fact of life.   Even\r\n\r\nif  some of us find the imagery of a lion too aggressive,\r\n\r\nor  too  carnivorous, and hope that we can have something\r\n\r\nmore  vegetarian,  I  would  say  that  the  defence   of\r\n\r\nSingapore must at least be that of a rhinoceros.  We must\r\n\r\nnever,  never  let it become that of a  sloth,  or  worse\r\n\r\nstill, a dodo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think that it is time that we stepped up\r\n\r\ntotal defence education and the practice of total defence\r\n\r\nbecause the circumstances are now upon us and we have  to\r\n\r\ntake  things  seriously.  Not only the Defence  Ministry,\r\n\r\nnot   only  the  Home  Affairs  Ministry,  not  only  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but our people, all of us.  This is a  window\r\n\r\nof  opportunity because these circumstances do cause more\r\n\r\npeople  to  take this message seriously.  To do  this,  I\r\n\r\nurge  MINDEF to engage, not only the usual channels  like\r\n\r\nadvertisements  and  exhibitions,  but  to   engage   the\r\n\r\nresources   of  the  CDCs,  the  IRCCs,  the   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations, the unions - all channels.  Because  these\r\n\r\nchannels  tap  into  different  networks  and  they  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  credibility  with different  segments  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  Tap  on  this,  think  about  how   we   can\r\n\r\noperationalise total defence better given this window  of\r\n\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like MINDEF to think about how to tap\r\n\r\non  all  the different languages - all the four  language\r\n\r\nmediums  -  in order to do this, and not just  place  too\r\n\r\nheavy  a weightage, for example, on English.

But,  Sir,\r\n\r\ntotal  defence, as the name would suggest,  requires  not\r\n\r\nonly  a comprehensive approach that addresses all aspects\r\n\r\nof defence.

Are Singaporeans ready for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  bomb  to  go  off?   What  about  the  threats  of\r\n\r\nbiological  weapons, anthrax?  Do they know what  to  do?\r\n\r\nAlso, one quarter of our residents of the population  are\r\n\r\nforeigners.

Given the\r\n\r\ndiversity of the different target groups - professionals,\r\n\r\nelderly,  youths, foreign workers, etc - how will  MINDEF\r\n\r\nensure  that these groups are effectively and efficiently\r\n\r\nreached   out  to?   Given  the  threat  from   religious\r\n\r\nextremists  lurking at the doorsteps and threatening  our\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion,  does  the  National  Education  Office\r\n\r\nintend  to  work  with  the  IRCCs  in  reaching  out  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans?

Although   the\r\n\r\nrelevance  of military and civil defence has always  been\r\n\r\nmore  readily grasped and appreciated, the importance  of\r\n\r\nthe other three elements of total defence, namely, in the\r\n\r\neconomic, social and psychological defence has not always\r\n\r\nbeen that clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many Singaporeans, social and psychological\r\n\r\ndefence  took on added significance after the  events  of\r\n\r\nSeptember  11th and the uncovering of the JI  network  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It showed that our security and stability and\r\n\r\nour  strength  as a nation also depends on religious  and\r\n\r\nracial  harmony,  the  points  reiterated  by  all  three\r\r\n\r\nMembers  of Parliament, the bonding among our people  and\r\n\r\nSingapore's commitment and loyalty to the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current economic difficulties also remind all of\r\n\r\nus of the important contribution of a strong economy will\r\n\r\nmake  towards  the  overall strength of  our  nation  and\r\n\r\nimportance of economic defence.  Sir, the central  notion\r\n\r\nin the concept of total defence is rightly pointed out by\r\n\r\nDr  Maliki  that every Singaporean has a contribution  to\r\n\r\nour  nation's defence.  Over the past year  or  so,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  would have realised that we  have  to  pull\r\n\r\ntogether\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  each  do  our part, because everyone's  contribution\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is particularly relevant in the context of\r\n\r\nthe  unique  nature of the threat of global  catastrophic\r\n\r\nterrorism.  Terrorists may target our homeland  and  this\r\n\r\nthreat  could come at any time from anywhere.  Our people\r\n\r\nmust  be alert and vigilant, and help to be the eyes  and\r\n\r\nears  of  the  community in looking  out  for  suspicious\r\n\r\nactivities.  Singaporeans can also  do  more  to  prepare\r\n\r\nourselves  so  that  they  are  equipped  to  respond  to\r\n\r\nemergencies.   We have a responsibility to ourselves,  to\r\n\r\nour families, to our community and to our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF's Central National Education Office has\r\n\r\nbeen  working  closely with all agencies,  including  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education, MITA, the Civil Service  College,\r\n\r\nthe  People's  Association and the CDC to bring  National\r\n\r\nEducation  programmes  to  different  segments   of   our\r\n\r\nsociety.   Dr  Maliki urged that more could  be  done  to\r\n\r\ncement  the  link between the total defence agencies  and\r\n\r\nthe CDCs.  This has been done and, of course, more can be\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key objectives are to develop national\r\n\r\ncohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in our\r\n\r\nfuture.   This  is  about  building  passion,  pride  and\r\n\r\ncommitment among Singaporeans.  So, National Education is\r\n\r\na long-term process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked about the indicators of the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of our National Education efforts.  Sir, this is\r\n\r\ndifficult to measure because it concerns the \"heartware\".\r\n\r\nBut  there  are  some proxy indicators  from  the  survey\r\n\r\nresults  which prove encouraging.  For instance, the  MOE\r\n\r\nconducted  a survey amongst students, and from  the  year\r\n\r\n1997 to 2001, there had been a steady improvement in such\r\n\r\nindicators, as the sense of belonging, confidence in  our\r\n\r\nfuture and tolerance for racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans also generally acknowledge the\r\n\r\nimportance  of National Education and its objectives.   A\r\n\r\nsurvey  by the Central National Education Office revealed\r\n\r\nthat 77% thought so.  Different agencies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  actively  promoting the concept  of  total  defence.\r\n\r\nTheir  routine  publications like this booklet  on  total\r\n\r\ndefence which I can pass on to the Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, key Ministers in the Cabinet make milestone\r\n\r\nspeeches  on  total defence.  Last year, at  the  Temasek\r\n\r\nseminar,  the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister,\r\n\r\nDr  Tony Tan, made his speech on total defence making  it\r\n\r\nrelevant,  a speech which is worth reading,  and  I  will\r\n\r\ncirculate it to the three Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki also asked how we could involve the 1\r\n\r\nmillion non-Singaporeans living in Singapore.  The  media\r\n\r\nhas  relayed the importance of total defence to different\r\n\r\nsegments   of   the   population,  including   the   non-Singaporeans living among us, and they are also aware  of\r\n\r\ntotal  defence.   In  addition, we also  invite  them  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in some of the activities.  Every year, there\r\n\r\nis  a  Total Defence Day which is held on 15th  February,\r\n\r\nand they are invited to take part in this event.  We also\r\n\r\nhave civil defence exercises.  The exercises are open  to\r\n\r\nall  residents living within the community.   So  if  you\r\n\r\nlive  within certain blocks of HDB flats, everybody there\r\n\r\nis  invited to join in the exercise, whether  you  are  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean, PR and even non-PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, thank you for raising the important\r\n\r\ntopic of total defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong, would you like to withdraw\r\n\r\nyour amendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to thank the DPM,\r\n\r\nMinisters  and Senior Parliamentary Secretary  for  their\r\n\r\ngood and full answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $7,728,000,000 for Head J ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $524,000,000 for Head J ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head P - Ministry of Home Affairs.\r\n\r\nItem No. 1, 180 minutes.

Members just now speaking\r\n\r\non  total defence and having listened to the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  Defence  Minister,  Dr  Tony  Tan,  saying\r\n\r\nearlier  that  we  cannot  underestimate  the  threat  of\r\n\r\nterrorism,  it  strikes me that when  we  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of home front security, it involves  more  than\r\n\r\njust one Ministry but several.  In terms of terrorism and\r\n\r\nhome  front  security, this House had debated this  issue\r\n\r\nvery exhaustively on the White Paper just two months ago,\r\n\r\nand yet when we speak to our people when we meet them  in\r\n\r\nblock visits or other functions, we are surprised and, in\r\n\r\na  way,  disappointed  that the  message  of  home  front\r\n\r\nsecurity has not really sunk in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising in a way because many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   are  now  juggling  with  bread-and-butter\r\n\r\nissues,   with   the   poor   economic   situation    and\r\n\r\nunemployment,  and  they  are more  worried  about  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood, and not about other issues, but I think it is\r\n\r\nvery  important  to  emphasise that home  front  security\r\n\r\nshould  be one of the priorities in every citizen's  list\r\n\r\nof priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of people have we met? What sort of\r\n\r\nattitudes  do  we encounter when we talk  to  them  about\r\n\r\nterrorism and home front security?  There is a  range  of\r\n\r\nattitudes. Some say that it is not their business.   They\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the  security forces   -   the  tidak  apa\r\n\r\nattitude  or  the bo chap attitude.  Some  say  they  are\r\n\r\nconcerned but they do not know very much about it.  These\r\n\r\nare  the uninformed people.  Much fewer say that they are\r\n\r\ninterested.   They have been trying to learn  more  about\r\n\r\nit,  but they actually do not know what to do.  They have\r\n\r\nreceived some booklets from the Home Affairs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  telling  them what to do  in  emergencies  but,\r\n\r\nreally,  they have no time to read.  And, in  any  event,\r\n\r\nsometimes  they do not understand the language which  is,\r\n\r\nat the moment, in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we do have a big problem in hand. Singaporeans\r\n\r\nhave,  very  rightly, thought that they are living  in  a\r\n\r\nvery peaceful and stable country, and our security forces\r\n\r\nmust  take  the credit for it.  But we are suffering  the\r\n\r\nfruits  of our own success, because many have decided  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the security forces to deal with  homeland\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this scenario, I regret to say that I have to\r\n\r\nraise  once  more  with the Minister  how  to  bring  the\r\n\r\nreality of the terrorist threat home to the people.  What\r\n\r\nhas  the  Ministry got to do to prepare and  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  be  more aware and vigilant about  terrorism?\r\n\r\nGiven the current situation where people are more worried\r\n\r\nabout  jobs than security, what should we do in order  to\r\n\r\nbe  pro-active in creating some awareness of the problems\r\n\r\nfaced  by countering terrorism?  In particular,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the Minister whether there could  be  some\r\n\r\nactivity-based programmes in school and grassroots levels\r\n\r\nto  involve the public, not just to inform them about the\r\n\r\nsecurity  threat but to involve them in basic  skills  on\r\n\r\nwhat  to do in emergency situations  -  situations  which\r\n\r\nwere  indicated  earlier by some Members  of  this  House\r\n\r\nconcerning  biological or bio-hazard attacks and  so  on,\r\n\r\nwhat  should  the people be doing. Should  we  have  more\r\n\r\nroadshows?   Should we have more campaigns to  alert  the\r\n\r\npeople on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin, could you wind up your\r\n\r\nspeech, please?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

The JI conspiracy in Singapore has also given us\r\n\r\nsome   very  disturbing  thoughts.   I  think  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enhance our security  awareness.   Here,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to raise three points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Changi Airport. Our Changi Airport is a\r\n\r\ntransport hub for Asia.  Millions of local travellers  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  tourists  pass through the airport  each  year.\r\n\r\nRecently,  I travelled overseas and I can feel  that  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  check  at our airport is very  stringent.   The\r\n\r\nonly  thing is that the time between the arrival  of  our\r\n\r\nluggage and until it is checked by the security personnel\r\n\r\ncould  provide  an opportunity for the terrorists  to  do\r\n\r\nsomething if they so desire.  Can something be done about\r\n\r\nit?   Can  we  just check the luggage the  moment  it  is\r\n\r\nbrought  into the airport?  Can we also  step  up  patrol\r\n\r\nwithin  the  terminal buildings, so that  any  unattended\r\n\r\nluggage could be removed for security sake?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, MRT stations. The MRT has become the\r\n\r\nmost  favoured  mode of transportation  for  our  people,\r\n\r\nyoung and old.  Can there be patrols in the MRT stations,\r\n\r\nparticularly those in the busy central business district?\r\n\r\nWe  could even engage private security companies to  step\r\n\r\nup patrol in the MRT stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on cruises. Many of our people\r\n\r\nare  now  going on cruises, and every cruise ship carries\r\n\r\nthousands  of  passengers on each trip.  Should  we  also\r\n\r\nstep up our security measures on the cruises?  Otherwise,\r\n\r\nif  anything is to happen, it will bring heavy casualties\r\n\r\nto our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, homeland\r\n\r\nsecurity requires multi-agency cooperation.  The  US  may\r\n\r\nhave  swung to one extreme with a whole behemoth  in  the\r\n\r\nform of Department of Homeland Security.  I am not asking\r\n\r\nfor  this,  as  we have to adapt what we  have  today  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  suit  our own local  requirements.   As  a\r\n\r\nnation, we have always been better organised, allowing us\r\n\r\nto  pull ahead with limited resources.  The formation  of\r\n\r\nthe ICA is encouraging.

However,  now\r\n\r\nthat the internal and external threats have changed, what\r\n\r\nhad  worked  for  us previously needs to be  re-examined.\r\n\r\nThere  are  lots of capabilities, both in  expertise  and\r\n\r\ntechnologies,  residing in many agencies, like  the  MPA,\r\n\r\nLTA,  MINDEF and the Police Force, etc.  Let us focus  on\r\n\r\nthe  integration of these capabilities and expertise,  so\r\n\r\nas  to effectively combat the new threats.

The   recent\r\n\r\neducational programmes on how Singaporeans should  manage\r\n\r\nin  the  event of a crisis as well as visits to the  bomb\r\n\r\nshelters  and  exhibits of our security capabilities  are\r\n\r\nvery  encouraging.  Nonetheless, we know  that  terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks  can come in many forms.  The terrorists  can  be\r\n\r\nboth  ingenious in their methods and persistent in  their\r\n\r\nobjectives.    The   acquisition  of  weapons   of   mass\r\n\r\ndestruction  is  regarded as  an  act  of  piety  by  the\r\n\r\nterrorists,  and  they  could  very  well  already   have\r\n\r\nchemical  and biological capabilities.

The compact living is already  a  great\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  those  maintaining our homeland  security.\r\n\r\nThe  September 11th 2001 and October 12th 2002  tragedies\r\n\r\nwere clear warnings to the world - that there is no place\r\n\r\nin the world that is safe from possible terrorist attack.\r\n\r\nThis  has led the security authorities all over the world\r\n\r\nto  review  their security policies and strategies.   For\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the arrests of Jemaah Islamiyah  members  are\r\n\r\nclear  indications that terrorist threat to our  homeland\r\n\r\nsecurity is a serious and real issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from this, there are also the possible\r\n\r\nimplications  arising  from  an  attack  on   Iraq.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  there  is  also  a  common  phenomenon   about\r\n\r\npossible  increase of criminal activities  following  the\r\n\r\neconomic  slowdown.  Figures available  have  shown  that\r\n\r\nthere  has been an increase in property-related offences.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of  first-time offenders  arrested  too  has\r\n\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this background, I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether he could update the House  on  the\r\n\r\nlatest  measures  taken to ensure  homeland  security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Realising that there is a limit to  what  the\r\n\r\nPolice  could  do, the programme known as  the  Community\r\n\r\nSecurity  and Safety Programme was launched to  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  community's involvement in ensuring the  safety  and\r\n\r\nsecurity of our neighbourhood.

I represent\r\n\r\nsome  of  these workers.  The workers were  reluctant  to\r\n\r\nprovide  some  of the information.  They  were  reluctant\r\n\r\nbecause of a lack of awareness of the seriousness of  the\r\n\r\nissue  at stake.

There,  the  inspection  and  security\r\n\r\nfunctions of three departments (Justice,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasury  and  Agriculture)  are  reorganised  into   two\r\n\r\nbureaus - one bureau to deal with border protection;  the\r\n\r\nother  to  deal with immigration and customs enforcement.\r\n\r\nHere,  the  immigration  and  customs  functions  at  our\r\n\r\nborders are being amalgamated under the authority of  the\r\n\r\nICA.  Several issues arise here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what would this move entail? Would customs\r\n\r\nofficers now also have to cover immigration security  and\r\n\r\nvice  versa?  While multi-tasking may be good, would  not\r\n\r\nspecialisation  and focus be more important  in  security\r\n\r\nmatters?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, would this transformation process\r\n\r\nadversely  affect  the  efficiency  and  morale  of   our\r\n\r\nimmigration and customs officers, at least in  the  short\r\n\r\nterm?  And how are these issues being handled?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, how would the formation of the ICA affect\r\n\r\nthe  tens  of  thousands of people who cross our  borders\r\n\r\nevery  day?   While enhancing security  is  vital,  would\r\n\r\nthere  be greater inconvenience?  We do have to  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind that Singapore's openness is key to our survival and\r\n\r\ngrowth,  and  therefore it is imperative that  we  ensure\r\n\r\nsmooth legitimate traffic flow across our borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, perhaps, most importantly, how would the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of the ICA actually enhance  our  borders'\r\n\r\nsecurity?  I request the Minister to give details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</b> Sir, the Internal Security\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  established  in  February   1966.    Its\r\n\r\npredecessors  were  the Ministry of Interior  Defence  in\r\n\r\n1965,  after  becoming  independent  from  Malaysia;  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Branch in 1948; and after World War I  in  1919,\r\n\r\nthe  British colonial government in Singapore  called  it\r\n\r\nthe  Special Branch.  That was how the Internal  Security\r\n\r\nDepartment transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISD has over the years become more sophisticated and\r\n\r\nprofessional.   They have ensured safety for  our  nation\r\n\r\nthrough   information   gathering   and   detention    of\r\n\r\nundesirable  persons.   However, Sir,  Singaporeans  know\r\n\r\nvery  little  about the ISD, and Singaporeans,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nfear the ISD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRightly  or  wrongly, intellectuals and some  politicians\r\n\r\nwould be fearful of them if they are seen or perceived to\r\n\r\nbe  anti-government or have views that are controversial.\r\n\r\nISD  should,  like  the CPIB, as I have  suggested,  give\r\n\r\nannual  reports  to  Parliament so  that  there  is  more\r\n\r\ntransparency in what they are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of reporting lines, I believe the ISD is\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Ministry of Home Affairs.   Does  the  ISD\r\n\r\nreport  to  the Minister for Home Affairs and  any  other\r\n\r\npersons?   Does  it report to any Ministry  or  Minister?\r\n\r\nWho  gets information about ISD, besides the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs?  What is the level of cooperation  between\r\n\r\nthe  ISD  and  equivalent agencies  in  ASEAN  countries,\r\n\r\nespecially  Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines?   Do\r\n\r\nwe  cooperate fully with the Special Branch of the ISD in\r\n\r\nMalaysia?   Do we have full cooperation between  our  ISD\r\n\r\nand international agencies of an equivalent nature?  What\r\n\r\nis  the  budget of ISD and how transparent  are  we  with\r\n\r\nregard  to this matter?  How much is really spent and  on\r\n\r\nwhat?  Can the Minister give some sort of a breakdown  on\r\n\r\nthe  activities  and the amounts spent  on  each  sector?\r\n\r\nAgain,  on the efficacy of the ISD, what is the yardstick\r\n\r\nto  measure  the  efficacy of the ISD,  since  all  other\r\n\r\nMinistries are being questioned?  Perhaps the  ISD  could\r\n\r\nreveal some of the information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of espionage, Sir, how many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  non-Singaporeans  have  been  detained\r\n\r\nunder  the Internal Security Act in the years 2000, 2001,\r\n\r\n2002  and currently, and for what reasons?  And how  many\r\n\r\nof  them  are  non-Singaporeans - Malaysians, Indonesians\r\n\r\nand from other ASEAN countries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11th September 2001 was, Sir, a sad and tragic day\r\n\r\nfor  the USA and the world at large.  Singapore faces its\r\n\r\nown  problems.  Fifteen persons were detained in December\r\n\r\n2001  - and it was reported - for their participation  in\r\n\r\nterrorist-related activities.  Thirteen of them,  we  are\r\n\r\ntold, are cell members of the clandestine organisation  - Jemaah  Islamiyah (JI).  Unfortunately, this  has  raised\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem of Muslims somehow being connected to this group,\r\n\r\nrightly or wrongly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask, Sir, based on ISD's collection\r\n\r\nof  information, what is the feel on the  ground  amongst\r\n\r\nMuslims and non-Muslims in Singapore?  Are they concerned\r\n\r\nand disillusioned by all this?  Do Muslims feel that they\r\n\r\nare  being discriminated against by the Government and/or\r\n\r\nother citizens?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, Singapore is facing its greatest security challenge\r\n\r\nsince  the  communist threat in the 1950s and 1960s.   If\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  war  in Iraq, then this  will  add  another\r\n\r\ndimension to Singapore's security environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I had said previously in this House, during the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the  Jemaah Islamiyah  (JI)  White  Paper  in\r\n\r\nJanuary, the Government has done and will continue to  do\r\n\r\nwhatever  it  can  to  secure our  borders,  to  step  up\r\n\r\nsecurity  at  our  land,  air  and  sea  checkpoints,  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the security of likely targets, to control the\r\n\r\nspread of extremist ideology and promote social cohesion.\r\n\r\nSo  far,  we have been successful, but we cannot let  our\r\n\r\nguard down, because we remain a target.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From intelligence sources, we are aware that the\r\n\r\nJemaah  Islamiyah  planning  by  Hambali  for  the   Bali\r\n\r\nbombings started as early as February 2002.  In fact, two\r\n\r\nbombing  attacks  were planned.  One was  for  an  attack\r\n\r\nagainst Western interests in Indonesia, which the  Jemaah\r\n\r\nIslamiyah later narrowed down to Bali.  The other  attack\r\n\r\nwas  against Singapore.  However, by mid-2002, the senior\r\n\r\nJI  operative  assigned to stage the attack on  Singapore\r\n\r\nreported to Hambali that he could not get the job done in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The target hardening measures  that  we  had\r\n\r\ntaken and the disruption of the local JI network made  it\r\n\r\ndifficult for him and he reported that he could not  find\r\n\r\nlocal  helpers or \"kaki tangan\" to assist him.   He  then\r\n\r\nleft  to  join  the other JI operatives in Indonesia  and\r\n\r\nwent  on to stage the Bali attack which happened on  12th\r\n\r\nOctober last year.  We are lucky this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have succeeded this time in pre-empting an attack\r\n\r\nagainst  us.   But no one can guarantee that a  terrorist\r\n\r\nattack  will not happen here.  Our approach  must  be  to\r\n\r\nmake  it extremely difficult to carry out their evil acts\r\n\r\nwhile,  at the same time, be prepared and ready  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the repercussions if such an attack does happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to inform\r\n\r\nthe  House of several new initiatives which we introduced\r\n\r\nrecently,  or  which would be launched soon.   We  firmly\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it  is  better  to  deny  terrorists   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  carry  out  their  operations  than   to\r\n\r\nmitigate  the  consequences of their  actions.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  we have been cooperating with our regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational counterparts, with good results.   And  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of the ISD, which Mr Chandra Mohan referred  to,\r\n\r\nhave  played  a great role in securing this  cooperation.\r\n\r\nAviation  security  will also be  enhanced  through   new\r\n\r\ninitiatives,  such as the formation of the  Air  Marshall\r\n\r\nUnit.    The   Police  Coast  Guard  will   upgrade   the\r\n\r\nsurveillance  capabilities and acquire newer  and  better\r\n\r\npatrol boats to strengthen our maritime security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng may be happy to know that post-September 11, we have enhanced the checks on arriving\r\n\r\npersons  and  their  belongings  at  our  land  and   sea\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  to 100%.  All pieces of luggage through  the\r\n\r\nAirport are also checked.  So Mr Ang and other travellers\r\n\r\nneed  not  worry  that,  if they go  to  Changi  Airport,\r\n\r\nluggage  would  be compromised.  The only exceptions  are\r\n\r\nthe  checks  on  cars  and goods  vehicles  at  Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint  and  the checks on motorcycles  at  Tuas  and\r\n\r\nWoodlands Checkpoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the escalation of threats in the Middle\r\n\r\nEast,  we  will be enhancing our checks further  to  100%\r\n\r\neven   at   Woodlands  Checkpoint  for   all   cars   and\r\n\r\nmotorcyclists  during the peak hours.   This  means  that\r\n\r\nevery  car and motorcycle entering Singapore at Woodlands\r\n\r\nCheckpoint  would have their boot and utility box  opened\r\n\r\nup for inspection.  It would also mean that all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncargoes arriving on lorries and container trucks will  be\r\n\r\nsubjected to a certain degree of checks.  This would take\r\n\r\neffect  today.   There may be some inconveniences  during\r\n\r\nthe peak hours and traffic jams will build up.  But it is\r\n\r\na  balance we have to make, and we need to make, for  the\r\n\r\nsake  of  our security and a small price to pay  for  the\r\n\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To strengthen our border security, we have formed a\r\n\r\nnew  agency,  the Immigration and Checkpoints  Authority,\r\n\r\nwhich   merges  the  border  control  functions  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Immigration and Registration and  the  Customs\r\n\r\nand  Excise Department into one single entity.  This will\r\n\r\nbe  formed  in  two weeks' time on 1st April.   Mr  Ahmad\r\n\r\nKhalis  asked  what  would  be the  implications  of  the\r\n\r\nformation  of  ICA  on border control operations  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  the public and the staff.  Firstly,  ICA  will\r\n\r\nprovide  an  integrated command over all aspects  of  our\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  operations.   This  would  enable  all   the\r\n\r\nagencies  operating at the checkpoints to share  critical\r\n\r\nintelligence  in  a  timely manner and  work  closely  to\r\n\r\ncoordinate  the  enforcement actions.   Over  the  medium\r\n\r\nterm,   a   study  to  re-engineer  operations   at   the\r\n\r\ncheckpoints  to  further  streamline  the  functions  and\r\n\r\ntighten coordination between the various agencies will be\r\n\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April, in the short term, there is no\r\n\r\nchange  to  what the officers do.  But a study  would  be\r\n\r\nembarked  to see how we can streamline and make  it  more\r\n\r\nseamless  and,  at  the  same  time,  better  deploy  the\r\n\r\nofficers.  So there will be multi-tasking.  Officers will\r\n\r\nbe  trained  to do the respective tasks.  In addition  to\r\n\r\nthat, they may also be reassigned from time to time.  All\r\n\r\nthis  will be transparent to the public.  In other words,\r\n\r\nas  far  as  the public is concerned, they  will  not  be\r\n\r\naffected  by  any  of  the changes.   There  will  be  no\r\n\r\ndegradation  in  the  level of service  provided  to  the\r\n\r\npublic   on  1st  April  when  ICA  is  formed  formally.\r\n\r\nInconvenience to travellers at land checkpoints  is  not,\r\n\r\nand will not be, due to the reorganisation.  It is due to\r\n\r\nthe   stepped-up  security  measures  that  I  have  just\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Ho Geok Choo expressed concern about the\r\n\r\ndetection,  utilisation and smuggling of  biological  and\r\n\r\nchemical agents, and whether we are equipped to deal with\r\n\r\nthis   threat.   The  threat  of  terrorists  using  non-conventional  means,  such  as  chemical  and  biological\r\n\r\nagents, is a very real one.  The recent uncovering  of  a\r\n\r\nplot to carry out a ricin attack in the United Kingdom is\r\n\r\njust  one  example.   Yet,  many  of  the  chemicals  and\r\n\r\nprecursors  necessary to produce bombs  as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nchemicals   and   biological  agents   have   legitimate,\r\n\r\ncommercial and medical uses.  In order to deny terrorists\r\n\r\naccess  to  dual-use materials which can  also  form  the\r\n\r\ningredients for bombs and other non-conventional weapons,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  will be coordinating a national  system  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the import, storage, transport and use  of  such\r\n\r\nmaterials.   Given  the diverse and wide  range  of  such\r\n\r\nchemicals,  the  full  measures  will  take  a  while  to\r\n\r\nimplement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to reduce the likelihood of terrorist\r\n\r\nattacks  using vehicles transporting hazardous materials,\r\n\r\nall  drivers  driving such vehicles that  transport  such\r\n\r\nmaterials  into and within Singapore will be required  to\r\n\r\nobtain   a  Hazardous  Material  (Hazmat)  Transportation\r\n\r\nDriver's  licence with effect from 1st April  this  year.\r\n\r\nThis  will  enable us to better control and monitor  such\r\n\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, since the sarin attack in Tokyo in\r\n\r\n1995,  we  have  built up the capability  to  respond  to\r\n\r\nbiological  and  chemical  threats  and  are  continually\r\n\r\nimproving  upon  it.  The Singapore Civil  Defence  Force\r\n\r\n(SCDF)  is  trained and equipped to carry out  detection,\r\n\r\nmitigation  and decontamination of these.  We  have  seen\r\n\r\nsome  of these being exercised from time to time  in  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Together with other relevant agencies, we  have\r\n\r\nplans   to   conduct  chemical  and  biological  response\r\n\r\noperations and equip ourselves to deal with these.  These\r\n\r\nplans are reviewed and exercised from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Wee Siew Kim has commented that more needs to be\r\n\r\ndone  to  leverage on technology to enhance our  security\r\n\r\nand to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nform  inter-agency cooperation groups.  We have and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so.  There are several inter-agency groups\r\n\r\nfocusing on different issues.  The Home Team has employed\r\n\r\nvarious biometrics, explosive detection, gamma ray, X-ray\r\n\r\nand other techniques to further augment existing security\r\n\r\nmeasures.   Radiographic scanners and biometric  systems,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  are already in use at some  of  our  entry\r\n\r\npoints  and  will  be used for the Hazmat  Transportation\r\n\r\nDrivers' Permit scheme when it is launched.  We have also\r\n\r\nbegun  pilot  trials for two days at  Parliament  for  an\r\n\r\nunder  carriage surveillance system.  Some of you  coming\r\n\r\nto  Parliament during the first two days will notice that\r\n\r\nthere  is  something on the ground.  That  is  the  under\r\n\r\nvehicle  surveillance system which we  are  testing  out.\r\n\r\nThis   system  is  specially  designed  to  examine   the\r\n\r\nundercarriages  of  vehicles with greater  accuracy  than\r\n\r\nconventional techniques like using hands to manipulate  a\r\n\r\nmirror.   Home  Team  departments are constantly  on  the\r\n\r\nlookout for new and emerging technologies that will  help\r\n\r\nenhance our security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung and Mr Nithiah Nandan have asked\r\n\r\nabout  efforts  to  raise the community's  awareness  and\r\n\r\ninvolvement  in the homefront security issues.   I  fully\r\n\r\nagree that there is a need to educate our people to prime\r\n\r\nthem  to take practical steps in exercising vigilance  to\r\n\r\nprepare themselves.  For those who are unconcerned  about\r\n\r\nsuch  a threat, or totally unaware that this is a serious\r\n\r\nthreat,  I  think they will be a liability to themselves.\r\n\r\nThey  will then not be able to protect themselves  should\r\n\r\nthey  see  something suspicious.  How can  we  bring  the\r\n\r\nmessage  clearly  to  the people?   We  can  have  public\r\n\r\neducation  programme  which  we  will  do,  and  I   will\r\n\r\nelaborate  afterwards,  but  the  only  way  to  heighten\r\n\r\nsecurity awareness and put people to the shock is to have\r\n\r\na  bomb  exploding in Singapore.  I do not think  anybody\r\n\r\nwants  that  to happen, before they wake  up  to  such  a\r\n\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in raising public awareness, we have launched\r\n\r\nthe   National  Security  Awareness  programme  on  Total\r\n\r\nDefence Day on 15th February.  This programme\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naims to educate and raise the awareness of the public  on\r\n\r\ncounter-terrorism  issues.  The Singapore  Civil  Defence\r\n\r\nForce  recently  distributed an emergency  handbook,  not\r\n\r\njust  in  one  language, but also in other  languages  as\r\n\r\nwell,  except  that the first issue on English  came  out\r\n\r\nearlier.   The  Chinese  and the other  version  are  now\r\n\r\navailable.   The  handbook tells the public  what  to  do\r\n\r\nduring emergency situations and a million copies of  this\r\n\r\nhave been given to a million households.  The Police  has\r\n\r\nalso  launched  a  pamphlet outlining the  measures  that\r\n\r\nresidents,  as well as the managements of buildings,  can\r\n\r\ntake  to help the Police prevent terrorism, and what they\r\n\r\nshould  do in the event of a security threat.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat the MRT operators will also look into the suggestion\r\n\r\nby  Mr  Ang about hiring guards, etc, and tighten up  the\r\n\r\nsecurity at our MRT stations.  But the Police and the MRT\r\n\r\nauthorities  as well as the operators have  been  working\r\n\r\nclosely to step up security at our MRT stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complementing this effort in raising public security\r\n\r\nawareness  is  a  web-based portal called  the  Emergency\r\n\r\nPreparedness   Information  Centre  (EPIC),   which   was\r\n\r\nlaunched  on  22nd  February.  EPIC not  only  keeps  the\r\n\r\npublic  informed on current developments during a crisis,\r\n\r\nor   National  Emergency,  it  also  provides  them  with\r\n\r\ninformation  on how to respond to various  scenarios.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  public will take an interest and go and  visit\r\n\r\nthe site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To raise public awareness on security issues, we\r\n\r\nhave  also  expanded  the Community Safety  and  Security\r\n\r\nProgramme (CSSP).  The Singapore Civil Defence Force  has\r\n\r\nconducted an Exercise Community Spirit activities to give\r\n\r\nthe  public an opportunity to learn about how  to  handle\r\n\r\nemergency,  and these are done not just in our grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations but will also be done at our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman asked what more can be done about CSSP.\r\n\r\nOur  Community Safety and Security Programme,  which  was\r\n\r\ntraditionally focused on local security and safety issues\r\n\r\nfor  grassroots  organisations, schools  and  workplaces,\r\n\r\nwill also be expanded to cover issues, such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  training in emergency preparedness skills,  community\r\n\r\nvigilance  and  education  on preventive  measures.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in  Sembawang GRC, the Woodlands Civil  Defence\r\n\r\nExecutive Committee has organised many such activities to\r\n\r\ngarner  resident  involvement in the  security  of  their\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Prof. Chin himself has been involved in this.\r\n\r\nSo  he  knows  about it.  Last year, the Singapore  Civil\r\n\r\nDefence  Force  also conducted emergency  and  evacuation\r\n\r\nexercises with the management, tenants and workers of the\r\n\r\nJurong Point Shopping Centre and a large engineering  and\r\n\r\nconstruction firm.  They would do more of such  exercises\r\n\r\nin   the   workplaces.   Through  such  programmes,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment would work hand-in-hand with the community  to\r\n\r\nraise Singaporeans' stake in the security of our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people themselves must take an interest. They\r\n\r\njust  cannot leave it to the Government to do  everything\r\n\r\nfor  them.   If they do not take an interest,  then  they\r\n\r\nwill  have  themselves to blame if something does  happen\r\n\r\ndue to their own neglect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on the White Paper in January this\r\n\r\nyear,  I  also  pointed out the need to  maintain  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  and  religious harmony as part of our  counter-terrorism  strategy.   Steps have  since  been  taken  to\r\n\r\npreserve  this  as  part of our social and  psychological\r\n\r\ndefence.   One such example is the Government's Community\r\n\r\nInvolvement  Programme.   Its  goal  is  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans gain a better understanding of each  other's\r\n\r\nculture and religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as far as race relations are concerned, the\r\n\r\nquestion which Mr Chandra Mohan raised, I think we are in\r\n\r\ngood  shape.   But more, of course, can be  done  by  our\r\n\r\ndifferent  races to reach out to understand  one  another\r\n\r\nand,  at  the same time, to know our neighbours.  Despite\r\n\r\nall  that we have done, I would urge and advise  that  we\r\n\r\nmust   not   be  lulled  into  a  sense  of  complacency.\r\n\r\nIronically,   the  efficiency  of  our  security   forces\r\n\r\nactually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrows  the gauntlet to the terrorists who see  it  as  a\r\n\r\nchallenge.   We  must be ready for such  an  eventuality.\r\n\r\nThe Government has and will continue to work closely with\r\n\r\nthe  community to maintain Singapore as a safe and secure\r\n\r\nbest  home  that it has always been for our people.   But\r\n\r\nthat requires the people's cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will answer Mr Chandra Mohan's question on\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Department.  He has raised several\r\n\r\nquestions, such as to whom does ISD report to, to who  it\r\n\r\nreports  its  findings, what are  the  checks,  and  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans know very little about the ISD.  In fact, he\r\n\r\nsaid that Singaporeans fear the ISD and there should be a\r\n\r\nreport  on the ISD to Parliament, just like some  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, because Singaporeans are quite ignorant\r\n\r\nabout  the  ISA,  and  there being some  doubts  or  even\r\n\r\nquestions whether the ISA has been misused, the  Ministry\r\n\r\ntook  the initiative to publish a booklet.  I am not sure\r\n\r\nwhether  Members themselves have seen this little booklet\r\n\r\ncalled  \"Why  the  ISA?\"  In fact, I had  once  suggested\r\n\r\nhaving this entitled \"Everything you wanted to know about\r\n\r\nthe  ISA  and are afraid to ask\"!  It is a simple booklet\r\n\r\ndescribing what is the ISA, the origin of the  ISA,  what\r\n\r\nare the threats facing us, what are the safeguards of the\r\n\r\nISA,  use of preventive detention and the advisory  board\r\n\r\nand  its  roles.   These are clearly  explained  in  this\r\n\r\nbooklet.   It also gives examples of some previous  cases\r\n\r\nin  regard  to each of the threats.  Members who  want  a\r\n\r\ncopy of it can let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department is one of the\r\n\r\nseveral  departments within the Ministry of Home Affairs.\r\n\r\nThe   Director  of  the  ISD  reports  to  the  Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  on  all matters pertaining to  the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nbudget  and  the financial and human resource  management\r\n\r\nissues.   He reports to the Minister on security matters.\r\n\r\nThe  Department's budget is governed, like all Government\r\n\r\ndepartments,  by  the  general financial  procedures  and\r\n\r\nrules in the public service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIts  operating budget allocation and its intended use are\r\n\r\nsubject  to  scrutiny by and require the support  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance within the larger budget  allocated\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much do we spend on the ISD, Mr Chandra Mohan\r\n\r\nasked.  It is less than 8% of the Ministry's budget.  The\r\n\r\nISD's budget and expenditures are also subject to regular\r\n\r\naudit,  like  other  Government  departments.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  money  that  it has spent,  like  any  other\r\n\r\nGovernment department, is subject to tight scrutiny,  and\r\n\r\nthey have to be justified before funds are approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ISD officers also exercise powers like police\r\n\r\nofficers,  because  they need them  for  law  enforcement\r\n\r\npurposes.   But they observe the same rules  like  police\r\n\r\nofficers.   They have the same standards of  professional\r\n\r\ndiscipline and conduct, and they are held accountable for\r\n\r\ntheir actions.  In other words, ISD officers cannot abuse\r\n\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who gets the information, findings and the products\r\n\r\nof  the ISD's work?  It depends on the subject matter and\r\n\r\nwho  needs to know.  The Department's work comprises many\r\n\r\nsecurity   portfolios  and  programmes,   including   the\r\n\r\nsubjects  of  terrorism, espionage, racial and  religious\r\n\r\nextremism, protective security, as well as educating  the\r\n\r\ncivil    servants   on   security.    Dissemination    of\r\n\r\nintelligence is on a need-to-know basis.  In other words,\r\n\r\nif  you do not need to know, there is no business for you\r\n\r\nto  know, you will not be told, and reports are sent only\r\n\r\nto  those  who need to know.  For example, the Department\r\n\r\ngives   security  and  intelligence  briefings   to   the\r\n\r\nCommittee of Permanent Secretaries, to keep them informed\r\n\r\nof  the  threats and the security issues facing  us.   It\r\n\r\nalso  briefs  me  and  the Prime Minister  and,  in  some\r\n\r\ninstances,  members  of  the  Cabinet  as  well,  on  the\r\n\r\nsubjects  of national security, eg, the Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we work with the regional counterparts? ISD\r\n\r\nhas very close relationships with its counterparts in the\r\n\r\nregion,  as  well  as with the other friendly  countries.\r\n\r\nThey  share and exchange information and they also attend\r\n\r\ncourses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof each other's services.  They keep each other informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we measure the efficacy of ISD? Although\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  aspects  of  its  work  which  can   be\r\n\r\nquantified and we can have quantitative output  measures,\r\n\r\nthe   efficacy   of  the  Internal  Security   Department\r\n\r\nultimately  rests on the qualitative judgment of  whether\r\n\r\nit  is  effective  in  meeting  its  mission  of  keeping\r\n\r\nSingapore and the country safe from security threats.   I\r\n\r\nthink the record speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many people are now detained for espionage\r\n\r\ncases?   As  of today, actually nobody has been detained.\r\n\r\nAll  have  been  released, and one is  on  a  restriction\r\n\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister in charge, I believe that the ISD\r\n\r\nhas acquitted itself very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Prof. Chin, you can take both your\r\n\r\ncuts together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

This increase is  about  49%\r\n\r\nsince  2001.

Miss\r\n\r\nPenny Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Penny Low -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, in the\r\n\r\nrecent  release of crime statistics for the year 2002  by\r\n\r\nthe  police, it was revealed that a significantly  higher\r\n\r\nnumber  of  juveniles were arrested in 2002  compared  to\r\n\r\n2001.   There was in fact an increase of 789 persons,  or\r\n\r\n55.8%.  The three offences committed by juveniles  -  and\r\n\r\nthe police had defined juveniles as persons between seven\r\n\r\nand  15  years of age - registering sharp increases  were\r\n\r\nshop  theft,  as Prof. Chin has mentioned, simple  theft,\r\n\r\nand  rioting.  Shop theft increased by 35%, simple  theft\r\n\r\nby 116.6%, and rioting by 138.7%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is indeed an urgent call to look into the\r\n\r\npossible   causes  of  this  worrying  trend  and,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly, what can we do about it.  I would also  like\r\n\r\nto advocate that resources be committed to embark on such\r\n\r\na  research  on  the cause and effect of this  increasing\r\n\r\ntrend.   An appropriate sampling of the offenders  should\r\n\r\nbe  studied  with the aim of understanding the underlying\r\n\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From media reports, the crimes committed by youths\r\n\r\nappear to be more violent nowadays than before.  This  is\r\n\r\nagain  another  worrying  trend.   For  many  years  now,\r\n\r\nparents  and educators were concerned over the access  of\r\n\r\nour  youths  to  materials which are violent  in  nature.\r\n\r\nThese   include  movies,  TV  programmes  and   cartoons,\r\n\r\nInternet websites, arcade and computer games.  Whilst  we\r\n\r\nmay  have already banned toy weapons, it is very easy for\r\n\r\na child to acquire a formidable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narsenal in a computer game to maim and kill.  The more he\r\n\r\nkills,  the higher the score, and he ascends to the  next\r\n\r\nlevel of the game, if he reaches the predetermined score.\r\n\r\nThe graphics and sound effects are very life-like and are\r\n\r\ndesigned to keep the child, and even adults, hooked  onto\r\n\r\nthe  game.   Apart  from the concern  on  addiction,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the child's threshold for violence may  have\r\n\r\nother ill effects, like violent behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are in the process of reviewing our\r\n\r\ncensorship  regime,  we  should  perhaps  look   at   the\r\n\r\nclassification  of games for different  age  groups,  not\r\n\r\nunlike  the NC16 category we have for movies.  We  should\r\n\r\nlook  at  what the developed countries have done  in  the\r\n\r\narea of alleviating violence in computer games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the adage that the youths of today are the\r\n\r\nleaders of tomorrow still holds true.  We should spare no\r\n\r\nefforts  in  doing  something to arrest  this  increasing\r\n\r\ntrend  of  crimes  amongst  juveniles  and  youths.   The\r\n\r\nproblem is complex and Singapore is not alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, I have been reminded of the story of\r\n\r\ntwo  British juveniles who lured an innocent toddler  and\r\n\r\nstoned  him  viciously and left him to die on  a  railway\r\n\r\ntrack, hit by an on-coming train.  We are far from  that,\r\n\r\nbut we certainly do not want to get there.  The Home Team\r\n\r\ncan  perhaps take the lead.  But the rest of society must\r\n\r\njoin hands.  Perhaps the Minister can comment on what and\r\n\r\nhow the community, family and schools can do to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Identify worrying signs in youths and\r\n\r\njuveniles;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Reach out to help the juveniles and youths;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Network with various agencies, such as the\r\n\r\npolice  and  counsellors to help  identify  our  troubled\r\n\r\nyouths; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) See what else we can do to help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeds we sow today will bear fruits tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore act fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not moving.

For years,  residents  were\r\n\r\nmade   familiar   with   the   bicycle-riding   policemen\r\n\r\npatrolling  their neighbourhoods and the  policemen  were\r\n\r\nseen  as  friends by our heartlanders.  The effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  this programme is public knowledge now.  However, due\r\n\r\nto  the need to be cost-effective, the manpower aspect of\r\n\r\npolice   operations   was   reviewed.    An   island-wide\r\n\r\nreorganisation of neighbourhood policing was carried out,\r\n\r\nand  Neighbourhood Police Centres were set  up.   In  the\r\n\r\nTampines GRC, one such centre is now operating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to what extent has\r\n\r\nthe NPC been successful in providing the effective safety\r\n\r\nand   security  network  in  Singapore,  especially   the\r\n\r\nheartland areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How:</b> Sir, the elderly person is a\r\n\r\nrelatively  easier target for criminals in  any  society.\r\n\r\nThis  is partly because they are generally not physically\r\n\r\nas strong or as fast as younger persons. Their ability to\r\n\r\nput  up  a  successful  struggle or  even  to  accurately\r\n\r\nidentify  the  criminal would also tend to be  less  than\r\n\r\nthat  of younger persons.  The less educated elderly  are\r\n\r\nalso easier targets for cheats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a climate of economic uncertainty or economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, their vulnerability would be increased.  If  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  Police crime figures for last year,  crime\r\n\r\nagainst   the   elderly  has  also  shown  a  significant\r\n\r\nincrease, whether it was robbery or cheating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's population is rapidly aging. What\r\n\r\nthis means is that the total\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of elderly persons and the proportion of  elderly\r\n\r\npersons  in our population would both grow.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nthink that we need to anticipate the implications of this\r\n\r\ntrend  and to take certain steps to address them so  that\r\n\r\nour elderly can enjoy a good quality of life and not have\r\n\r\nto contend with a progressive loss of a sense of security\r\n\r\nand an increasing fear of crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I urge MHA to continue to emphasise all\r\n\r\ncrime  prevention education efforts for the  elderly  and\r\n\r\ntheir  families.   In addition, I also suggest  that  MHA\r\n\r\nconsider  different  ways  of  increasing  the  deterrent\r\n\r\nfactor to deter crimes against the elderly. For instance,\r\n\r\nwe  currently have laws that impose heavier penalties for\r\n\r\naggravated   forms   of  crimes  or   for   crimes   that\r\n\r\nparticularly  put  fear into the victims.   I  urge  that\r\n\r\ncrimes  against the elderly, especially violent  property\r\n\r\ncrimes,  such  as robbery, snatch theft and  cheating  be\r\n\r\nclassified  as an aggravated form of crime that  attracts\r\n\r\nheavier penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, several MPs have raised\r\n\r\nconcerns  over an increase in crime rates in  2002.   The\r\n\r\nnearly  10% increase in total seizable offence  for  2002\r\n\r\nshould  be  seen  in  the context of an  improving  crime\r\n\r\nsituation which has been trending downwards in a positive\r\n\r\ndirection in the last 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crime rate in 2002 was the lowest in the last 15\r\n\r\nyears  with  the exception of 2001. The crime  rate  last\r\n\r\nyear  was  also  lower than that in 1998 when  a  similar\r\n\r\nincrease  in  crime rate was observed.   Efforts  by  the\r\n\r\nPolice last year resulted in 15.4% or 2,917 more arrests.\r\n\r\nThe  number of persons arrested last year was the highest\r\n\r\nnumber in the last 15 years, and the increase of 15.4% is\r\n\r\nproportionately more than the increase in crime  rate  of\r\n\r\nabout 10%.  So we must see the increase in crime rate  in\r\n\r\nits proper context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Singapore remains one of\r\n\r\nthe  safest  cities in the world.  In a recent  worldwide\r\n\r\nsurvey  of  cities in November 2002 conducted  by  Mercer\r\n\r\nHuman  Resource Consultancy, Singapore is jointly  ranked\r\n\r\nthe second safest city in the world, together with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHelsinki, Zurich, Geneva and Bern.  Lumxembourg was named\r\n\r\nthe  world's safest city.  A few of Japan's cities, which\r\n\r\nranked 7th, were the only other Asian country in the  top\r\n\r\n10  positions.  The next highest South-east Asian  cities\r\n\r\nranked  after  Singapore  were  Johore  Bahru  and  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. They were at the 73rd position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin has asked if the competing demands of\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  crime threats have posed a strain  on  our\r\n\r\nHome Team resources and, more importantly, whether we can\r\n\r\nsustain  ourselves,  with  the  need  to  watch  out  for\r\n\r\nsecurity and, at the same time, also deal with crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to combat both crimes and security threats\r\n\r\nafter  911  has certainly stretched not just  the  Police\r\n\r\nresources,  but  also our Home Team resources.   However,\r\n\r\nthe  Police  has coped well so far.  Following  September\r\n\r\n11,   crime   and   security   patrols   were   increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly, as Members would have noted.   The  Police\r\n\r\nwas  able to achieve this by firstly, leveraging on every\r\n\r\navailable  staff, Police NSmen as well as  officers  from\r\n\r\nthe  specialist  units  such as  the  Gurkha  Contingent.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  Police streamlined its response to  non-urgent\r\n\r\ncases  so  that resources can be focused on  more  urgent\r\n\r\nones.  Thirdly,  Police  has  scaled  down  non-essential\r\n\r\nservices, such as handling of the lost and found  reports\r\n\r\nand  rescuing trapped animals, in order to free up scarce\r\n\r\nresources.   Let  me assure Members that  the  Police  is\r\n\r\ngeared  up  to  face the challenges ahead.   Neither  the\r\n\r\nchallenges of security nor crime will be neglected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer examination of the crime situation reveals an\r\n\r\nemerging  pattern of concern in two areas.  One, juvenile\r\n\r\ncrime  and the other crime against the elderly, as  Mayor\r\n\r\nHeng suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On youth crime, 2002 saw a significant increase in\r\n\r\nthe arrest of youth offenders who are categorised between\r\n\r\n7  and 19.  But actually, there are very few that are  at\r\n\r\nthe  younger ages.  This increase was by 49%, from  2,756\r\n\r\nto  4,099  youths  arrested.  As in previous  years,  the\r\n\r\nmajority,  or  68%, of these offenders were arrested  for\r\n\r\ntheft\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  related  offences. For theft,  a  lot  of  them  are\r\n\r\nshoplifting offences.  For shoplifting offences, many  of\r\n\r\nthem  can  be  prevented if the retailers themselves  are\r\n\r\nmore vigilant. 8% of those arrested for simple thefts and\r\n\r\nshop  thefts were repeat offenders, because some of  them\r\n\r\nhave the habit of repeating the offence.  Youths arrested\r\n\r\nfor  public  order  offences,  namely,  serious  assault,\r\n\r\nrioting  and  unlawful assembly, made up another  13%  of\r\n\r\nyouth  offenders arrested last year.  Of these,  5%  were\r\n\r\nrepeat offences.  Although the numbers of youth offenders\r\n\r\narrested  for  theft  and  related  offences  and  public\r\n\r\noffences  were respectively 54% and 60% higher than  that\r\n\r\nin  the year 2001, the overall figure is still lower than\r\n\r\nin 1998.  So again, we must see this in the context of  a\r\n\r\ndeclining  crime situation in the whole of Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe last 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in youth crime is consistent with the\r\n\r\noverall  increase  in crime, and it could  be  due  to  a\r\n\r\nmyriad  of reasons.  We note that this phenomenon is  not\r\n\r\npeculiar only to Singapore but also it is endemic in most\r\n\r\ndeveloped  countries and we have taken measures  to  curb\r\n\r\nthis trend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the causes of the rising crime among the\r\n\r\nyouths?  That  is  a  subject  which  the  Inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Youth  Crime  (IMYC)  chaired  by   Senior\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Assoc.  Prof.\r\n\r\nHo  Peng  Hee,  and comprising the senior representatives\r\n\r\nfrom  the Ministries of Community Development and Sports,\r\n\r\nEducation,   Home  Affairs,  the  Police,   the   Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment, National Youth Council, the National  Council\r\n\r\nof  Social  Services,  and academics,  etc,  could  study\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But already under the Inter-Ministry Committee on\r\n\r\nYouth Crime, there are various programmes introduced. For\r\n\r\nexample,  81  schools initiated the School Community  and\r\n\r\nSafety Programme that was targeted at preventing juvenile\r\n\r\ndelinquency.   Other measures include  the  Police-School\r\n\r\nLiaison System where there is direct liaison between  the\r\n\r\nschools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  the  Police  would  provide  them  with  an  instant\r\n\r\nconnection,  as  well as the Honorary  Volunteer  Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary (School) Scheme.  These are the teachers  or\r\n\r\ndisciplinary   masters  who  become   voluntary   special\r\n\r\nconstables who can put on an uniform and help to  instill\r\n\r\nsome discipline among the young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the school programme failed? Again, the IMYC\r\n\r\ncould  take  a look at that.  My own guess right  now  is\r\n\r\nthat  I do not think so because if you look at the  types\r\n\r\nof  people  who commit youth crimes, they are not  mainly\r\n\r\nour students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To specifically address the rise in theft-related\r\n\r\npublic-order crimes amongst youth offenders,  the  Police\r\n\r\nhas produced and developed an information package on shop\r\n\r\ntheft  and rioting for more than 300 schools and tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   The  Prisons  Visit  Programme  will   be\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  reach out to more youths and  not  just  to\r\n\r\nthose who are involved in gangs.  Over 4,000 students and\r\n\r\nother  youths have attended this Prisons Visit Programme.\r\n\r\nThe students are organised in groups and they go and take\r\n\r\na  look  at  what is inside the prison.  Those  who  went\r\n\r\nthere  would  know what life is like.  I hope  that  they\r\n\r\nwould understand that it is not a comfortable place to be\r\n\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other measures in place to help\r\n\r\narrested  youth  offenders to  remain  crime-free.   This\r\n\r\nincludes   the  Guidance  Programme  and  the  StreetWise\r\n\r\nProgramme   which  comprises  counselling,   supervision,\r\n\r\ndevelopmental  and academic support, an  active  parental\r\n\r\ninvolvement session aimed at keeping our youths away from\r\n\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area of concern is crime against the\r\n\r\nelderly.  We read about this in the papers from time  and\r\n\r\ntime. We are therefore wondering whether indeed this is a\r\n\r\nserious  problem.  Let me put the numbers in perspective.\r\n\r\nIn  2002,  there  were  95  elderly  victims  of  robbery\r\n\r\ncompared  to  80  in  2001.  More than three-quarters  of\r\n\r\nthese  victims  are  females. Cheating involving  elderly\r\n\r\nvictims also rose from 43 to 63 persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mayor Heng Chee How that crimes against\r\n\r\nsuch  vulnerable persons are despicable and the offenders\r\n\r\ndeserve  enhanced punishment.  But I do not think  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  have  a  separate  scheme  of   graduated\r\n\r\npenalties for those who commit crimes against the elderly\r\n\r\nor  any  other  vulnerable groups, such as children,  the\r\n\r\nhandicapped  or  women.  Otherwise, we  start  to  divide\r\n\r\npeople  and punish them according to the age or according\r\n\r\nto  their vulnerability.   In all cases of crimes against\r\n\r\nsuch  vulnerable people, the prosecution can press for  a\r\n\r\ndeterrent  sentence and the courts may  impose  a  higher\r\n\r\nsentence  if  there  are  aggravating  circumstances   or\r\n\r\nfactors.  Indeed, the prosecution, as well as the courts,\r\n\r\nhas done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To educate the elderly on crime prevention, the\r\n\r\nPolice   launched   the   Crime  Prevention   Ambassadors\r\n\r\nProgramme  in  September 2002 to  recruit  active  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  to help the Police to promote crime  prevention\r\n\r\nawareness among the elderly. Police also organised  chit-chat  sessions, exhibitions and media campaigns  targeted\r\n\r\nspecifically at the elderly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also, on several occasions in this House,\r\n\r\nstressed  the importance of the community to join  forces\r\n\r\nwith  the Police to fight against crimes.  Now more  than\r\n\r\never,  the community is needed to safeguard our security.\r\n\r\nResidents and communities must take responsibilities  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own security as well.  The Police officers  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  everywhere.  A significant number in our community do\r\n\r\ntake part in the various activities. Efforts such as  the\r\n\r\nCrime Prevention Ambassadors Programme, which I mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier,  remind  us  of  the  important  role  that  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  can  play  in  combating  crime.  The   public\r\n\r\nassisted in the arrest of 44.6% of all criminals involved\r\n\r\nin  major crimes last year.  When I mentioned this figure\r\n\r\nto visiting Police officers or the Ministers in charge of\r\n\r\nPolice,  they were surprised because, in their countries,\r\n\r\nit is not easy to get the public to help out in arresting\r\n\r\nsuspects.  In our case, I think people know that we run a\r\n\r\nclean  system, the Police can be trusted, and  they  have\r\n\r\nconfidence in the way we do things.  I want to commend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese public-spirited citizens who come forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, the cornerstone of our\r\n\r\ncommunity partnership effort is the Community Safety  and\r\n\r\nSecurity  Programme where members of the local  community\r\n\r\nwork together with the Home Team to tackle local security\r\n\r\nand   safety   issues.   Today,  we   have   nearly   600\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood   Watch  Zones  covering  almost   all   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  implementing  a wide  variety  of  programmes\r\n\r\nranging   from   Citizens-on-Patrol,   crime   prevention\r\n\r\ndiscussions for the elderly, to house visits where  crime\r\n\r\nprevention information is disseminated.  I would want  to\r\n\r\nencourage  all Singaporeans to make themselves  aware  of\r\n\r\nthese  programmes and to take part in them, if they  wish\r\n\r\nto play a more active role in tackling crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman Yusof asked about the Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nPolice  Centre  (NPC)  system of community  policing  and\r\n\r\nwhether   this   has  helped  the  level   of   community\r\n\r\ninvolvement in crime prevention.  I am pleased to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  the transition has  gone  on  smoothly.\r\n\r\nMembers may recall that the Police decided to change  the\r\n\r\nNeighbourhood  Police  Post system to  the  Neighbourhood\r\n\r\nPolice Centre (NPC) system in 1996.  Now, we have  31  of\r\n\r\nthe 32 planned NPCs in operation.  The last one, Sengkang\r\n\r\nNPC, will be due to open in the middle of next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what extent have the Neighbourhood Police Centres\r\n\r\nbeen  successful?   I  would  say  that  they  have  been\r\n\r\neffective  in  keeping our crime rates low.   The  larger\r\n\r\nnumber  of  personnel at each NPC allows  the  Police  to\r\n\r\ndeploy  more  officers  out on patrols,  thus  increasing\r\n\r\npolice   visibility   in   their   neighbourhood.    With\r\n\r\nresources,  such  as fast-response cars,  the  NPCs  also\r\n\r\nrespond  faster  to urgent cases.  They have  established\r\n\r\nstrong     working    relationships    with    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations and other agencies, such as schools, family\r\n\r\nservice  centres and so on in their precincts.   And  the\r\n\r\nresidents  can  raise  any  local  safety  and   security\r\n\r\nconcerns, and our officers\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  work  with  them to design and implement  effective\r\n\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we going to give the CSSPs more resources?\r\n\r\nCSSP, by its definition, is community effort.  The Police\r\n\r\nwill be there to help them, guide them, provide them with\r\n\r\nmuch  knowledge  as possible, give them the  figures  and\r\n\r\ntell   them  what  else  they  can  do  to  help  protect\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Ultimately, the community  themselves  will\r\n\r\nhave to find the resources with the support given by  the\r\n\r\nHome Team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the National Crime Prevention Council.\r\n\r\nThey  also  work very closely with the various industrial\r\n\r\nsectors.   From  time  to time, they hold  meetings  with\r\n\r\nindustry representatives and give them suggestions on how\r\n\r\nto  deal  with certain issues.  The Council also produces\r\n\r\npublications, videos, etc, to help educate the  workforce\r\n\r\nas  well  as  the management, and the Police provide  the\r\n\r\nCouncil with as much support as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the crime rate actually went up last year, but\r\n\r\nit  is well under control.  Let me assure the public  and\r\n\r\nMembers  that the Police is well poised to deal with  the\r\n\r\nsituation  but,  again, as I have  said,  please  do  not\r\n\r\ndepend  on the Police to be everywhere.  The public  must\r\n\r\ndo  their part, if we want Singapore to remain a safe and\r\n\r\nsecure best home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Indranee Rajah is not moving.

Drug  abusers,  last\r\n\r\nyear,  registered a marginal 1% decline.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  the number of new drug abusers had increased,  and\r\n\r\nthis has hit a 5-year record high.  In fact, 911 new drug\r\n\r\nabusers were arrested last year, making it a 16% increase\r\n\r\nover  2001.  The good news is that the number  of  heroin\r\n\r\nabusers  arrested has decreased.  It made up  of  66%  of\r\n\r\nlast  year's  arrests compared to 80% in previous  years.\r\n\r\nOf  the number of new abusers last year, two-thirds  were\r\n\r\nmen aged 30 and above, and more than  half of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem were men in their 20s.  Sir, this is worrying as the\r\n\r\ntrend   seems  to  indicate  that  younger   adults   are\r\n\r\nexperimenting with synthetic drugs, like ice and catamine\r\n\r\nat  nightspots.   Last year, the number  of  ice  abusers\r\n\r\ndoubled  while catamine abusers went up almost 90%.   The\r\n\r\ngeneral  impression  is  that synthetic  drugs  are  non-addictive and harmless.  Doctors, on the other hand, have\r\n\r\nwarned  that  these  drugs may  give  abusers  kicks  and\r\n\r\naltered  sensations,  and  prolonged  abuse  will   cause\r\n\r\nirreversible damage to the organs.  Can the Minister tell\r\n\r\nthis House what is being done to arrest the growing trend\r\n\r\nof  synthetic  drug  abuse?  What  programmes  are  there\r\n\r\navailable to ensure that the harmful effects of synthetic\r\n\r\ndrugs  are  made  known  to   students  and  the  general\r\n\r\npopulation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Sir, the latest figures have\r\n\r\nindicated  a  general  decline in the  numbers  of  those\r\n\r\narrested  for old drug offenders.  These are  people  who\r\n\r\ntake heroin, morphine, marijuana and opium.  We have good\r\n\r\nreasons  to  feel  encouraged  by  the  decline  of  drug\r\n\r\noffenders under this category, congratulate the anti-drug\r\n\r\nagency   and  the  community-based  groups  involved   in\r\n\r\ncounselling and rehabilitation for their fine  work.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, we are deeply concerned with the increase\r\n\r\nin  the  number  of new drug offenders,  including  those\r\n\r\ntaking  ice  and  ketamine, especially among  the  young.\r\n\r\nGiven the tenacity in which the anti-drug agency work,  I\r\n\r\nam  confident  that we can tackle this new  problem  too.\r\n\r\nWhat  kind of cooperation that the Police needs from  the\r\n\r\npeople to make sure that this new effort is successful?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, during my meet-the-people sessions, I have\r\n\r\nseen  less and less drug abuse related cases referred  to\r\n\r\nme.   During  their  monthly  meetings,  members  of  the\r\n\r\nTampines  Anti-Drug  Task Force  Committee  shared  their\r\n\r\nobservations  with me.  They said that  one  of  the  key\r\n\r\nfactors for the declining number of drug offenders is due\r\n\r\nto  the  long-term  detention which was  introduced  some\r\n\r\nyears ago.

Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like to add to the comments that hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  Mr Chandra Mohan, has just mentioned.  Over  the\r\n\r\nyears,  the  Ministry has progressively taken  innovative\r\n\r\nsteps  to  improve the rehabilitation programmes  in  the\r\n\r\nprisons,   reformative   training   centres   and    drug\r\n\r\nrehabilitation centres.  These programmes, if  effective,\r\n\r\nshould  help  to reform the offenders.  These  programmes\r\n\r\ntoo  should also be able to help different categories  of\r\n\r\noffenders  under  the  charge of the Prisons  Department.\r\n\r\nOne  such group are those who commit offences of a sexual\r\n\r\nnature arising from some psychological disorder, offences\r\n\r\nsuch  as  outraging of modesty, exhibitionism and  sexual\r\n\r\nassaults including rape, for example.  In this regard,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask the Minister (1) what has been  done;\r\n\r\nand  (2)  is  enough  being done by  way  of  specialised\r\n\r\ntherapeutic treatment and other rehabilitation programmes\r\n\r\nfor such incarcerated offenders, so that there is minimal\r\n\r\ndanger  and,  ideally, no danger of them repeating  their\r\n\r\noffences  upon discharge from the penal and  correctional\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, former offenders\r\n\r\noften  leave their penal institutions with the desire  to\r\n\r\nturn  over a new leaf.  Many strive to build their  lives\r\n\r\nand  they certainly desire to lead normal lives.  One  of\r\n\r\nthe constant struggles is the stigma that stays with them\r\n\r\nfor a very long time  - the label of being an ex-convict.\r\n\r\nWith  this label, many have difficulties securing  stable\r\n\r\nemployment  simply  because  employers  resist  employing\r\n\r\nthem, sometimes even disregarding the length of time they\r\n\r\nhave  been  able to stay away from crime  or  drugs,  nor\r\n\r\nwhether they have the necessary qualifications to do  the\r\n\r\njob.   Sentencing  them  to  institutions  achieves   the\r\n\r\nobjective  of taking away their freedom from them,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom penalising them for their misbehaviours.  But, often\r\n\r\ntimes,  they do not necessarily gain total freedom,  even\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are released.

Yet, there are those who are\r\n\r\nresilient enough to stick through the odds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many professionals who work with ex-convicts\r\n\r\nwill  testify that expunging the records of those  former\r\n\r\noffenders who have shown their ability to stay away  from\r\n\r\ncrime  for  a period of time will enhance their continued\r\n\r\nrecovery   and   contribution  to  society.    They   are\r\n\r\nresilient.   Expunging their records will  surely  enable\r\n\r\nthem  to  seek  regular  and  stable  employment.   Thus,\r\n\r\nproviding  stability to their lives  and  that  of  their\r\n\r\nfamily  members.   Yesterday, we  heard  that  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice has started employing ex-convicts based on  their\r\n\r\nmerit.   Human  nature will not stop  us  from  having  a\r\n\r\nsecond  thought about the person, no matter how qualified\r\n\r\nhe  is  if we know that he has a criminal record.   I  am\r\n\r\ncertain  their chances of seeking employment, whether  in\r\n\r\nthe  private or public sectors, will be greatly  enhanced\r\n\r\nif their criminal records are expunged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we heard the Minister for Law agreeing on\r\n\r\nthe need to decriminalise some regulatory offences.  This\r\n\r\nis  indeed  laudable.  Last year, the Senior Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  for Home Affairs reported in this House  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry is considering the amendment to the Registration\r\n\r\nof  Criminals  Act,  so  that those  convicted  of  minor\r\n\r\noffences   will  have  their  criminal  records  rendered\r\n\r\nstanched  or expunged after a certain period if  they  do\r\n\r\nnot  re-offend.   Indeed,  this  will  further  help  ex-offenders  find  jobs,  as the  records  will  no  longer\r\n\r\nfeature  in the assessment of an individual's suitability\r\n\r\nfor the job.  I would like to ask the Minister the status\r\n\r\nof  this process.  When can we expect the amendment to be\r\n\r\nintroduced in this House?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as our society develops and matures, we must\r\n\r\nreflect  it  through our willingness to be forgiving  and\r\n\r\ncompassionate.  I look forward to the proposed  amendment\r\n\r\nto  be  introduced  and  for us  to  be  able  to  indeed\r\n\r\nfacilitate  and enhance every Singaporean's potential  to\r\n\r\nthe fullest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir, I will respond to the\r\n\r\nspeeches of Mdm Ho Geok Choo, Encik Yatiman Yusof,  Prof.\r\n\r\nNgiam  and  Dr Maliki, and my colleague, Mr Maidin,  will\r\n\r\nrespond to Mr Chandra Mohan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the drug situation. Both Mdm Ho and Mr\r\n\r\nYatiman  have  expressed  some concerns  about  the  drug\r\n\r\nsituation, in particular, about the synthetic drug  abuse\r\n\r\nsituation, especially amongst the young.  Heroin used  to\r\n\r\nbe  the main drug abuse for more than 30 years.  However,\r\n\r\nthe number of people arrested for abusing heroin has been\r\n\r\nfalling steadily over the past 10 years.  Last year, some\r\n\r\n2,200  heroin abusers were arrested, as compared to 5,300\r\n\r\nin  1992.  So the number has come down quite a  bit.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, synthetic drug abuse has risen in recent\r\n\r\nyears.   About  30% of local drug abusers  arrested  last\r\n\r\nyear   consumed   synthetic  drugs   such   as   ecstasy,\r\n\r\nmethamphetamine  and ketamine.  The number  of  synthetic\r\n\r\ndrug  abusers has more than doubled from 438 in  1999  to\r\n\r\n970 last year.  Amongst young abusers, aged 19 and below,\r\n\r\nsynthetic drug abusers have displaced heroin as the  main\r\n\r\ndrug  of abuse.  And I think this is also the point  made\r\n\r\nby  Mdm  Ho.  61% of young abusers arrested in 2002  were\r\n\r\nsynthetic drug abusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may sound like frightening figures. But I\r\n\r\nthink  I should put these figures in perspective, because\r\n\r\nI  would  like to assure the House that the overall  drug\r\n\r\nsituation is not a bleak one.  Let me cite some  figures.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  total number of drug abusers arrested  has\r\n\r\ndeclined  from  over 6,000 in 1994 to  under  3,500  last\r\n\r\nyear.  Secondly, the number of drug abusers, aged 19  and\r\n\r\nbelow,  has also declined over the years, from a high  of\r\n\r\n679 young abusers arrested in 1993 to 215 last year.   As\r\n\r\na  percentage  of total abusers arrested, the  number  of\r\n\r\nyoung  abusers  arrested for drug  consumption  has  also\r\n\r\nfallen  from more than 11% in 1993 to about 6%  in  2002.\r\n\r\nHence,  the overall drug situation actually has  kept  on\r\n\r\nimproving,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich has been the case for the last six or seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think all that we read points to this new\r\n\r\nthreat  that is emerging.  The absolute numbers  are  not\r\n\r\nlarge.  But in terms of the percentage increase, I  think\r\n\r\nthat  is  a concern.  Hence, MHA takes a serious view  of\r\n\r\nthe  growing  abuse of synthetic drugs and we  will  take\r\n\r\naction  to  nip it in the bud.  As Mdm Ho very succinctly\r\n\r\nputs  it,  synthetic drugs are harmful and possibly  even\r\n\r\nfatal.  I think that is the first misconception that must\r\n\r\nbe  dispelled.   Because anyone thinking of experimenting\r\n\r\nwith  synthetic  drugs  must not delude  themselves  into\r\n\r\nbelieving  that these drugs are harmless or non-addictive\r\n\r\nor  even hip.  They pose similar health and mental  risks\r\n\r\nto the individual as opiate drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MHA takes a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach\r\n\r\nto  tackling the drug problem.  What do I mean by  multi-pronged?  A total integrated approach encompassing strict\r\n\r\nlaws,  vigorous  enforcement, proactive  preventive  drug\r\n\r\neducation, rehabilitation and aftercare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, enforcement. The Central Narcotics Bureau\r\n\r\nconducts   regular   raids  against  drug   abusers   and\r\n\r\ntraffickers.  Last year alone, CNB carried out  51  major\r\n\r\ndrug  raids  and broke up 32 drug trafficking syndicates.\r\n\r\nCNB   also   works  closely  with  its  counterparts   in\r\n\r\nneighbouring   countries  to  exchange  information   and\r\n\r\nconduct  joint operations.  This ensures that  we  tackle\r\n\r\nthe  drug  situation even before it reaches  our  shores.\r\n\r\nCNB  is also active in preventive drug education and  has\r\n\r\nstepped  up efforts on publicising the dangers of abusing\r\n\r\nsynthetic   drugs.    A  host  of  preventive   education\r\n\r\ninitiatives, including talks, competitions and other mass\r\n\r\noutreach  activities, have been organised to  communicate\r\n\r\nthe  anti-drug  message.   In  particular,  the  National\r\n\r\nCouncil Against Drug Abuse, which is chaired by a private\r\n\r\nsector  person  and also supported by a  lot  of  private\r\n\r\nsector  people with different expertise and  backgrounds,\r\n\r\nplays  a  key  role.  And it has been very innovative  in\r\n\r\nmounting programmes that reach out to students and  young\r\n\r\npeople in ways that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill appeal to them, in particular drawing in members  of\r\n\r\nthe  mass media and advertising agencies to put out  very\r\n\r\nstriking  publicity materials warning against the  taking\r\n\r\nof drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third prong, Sir, is rehabilitation. New opiate\r\n\r\nabusers   are  currently  given  a  chance   to   undergo\r\n\r\nrehabilitation at drug rehabilitation centres.  These are\r\n\r\nthe  heroin  abusers.  In contrast,  new  synthetic  drug\r\n\r\nabusers  are  prosecuted in court and, if convicted,  are\r\n\r\nsent to prison.  MHA is now considering whether we should\r\n\r\nalso  send  synthetic drug abusers to drug rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentres.   This  will ensure that such abusers  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity   to   undergo  structured   and   supervised\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.   This  will  help  them   overcome   the\r\n\r\ntemptation to abuse drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman has asked about the effectiveness of the\r\n\r\nlong-term imprisonment scheme.  The scheme was introduced\r\n\r\nin  1998  with  the twin objectives of removing  hardcore\r\n\r\ndrug   addicts  from  society,  to  prevent   them   from\r\n\r\ncontaminating others as well as deterring other  addicts.\r\n\r\nMembers will know that under the scheme, hardcore addicts\r\n\r\nwith three or more convictions are no longer sent to DRCs\r\n\r\nbut  to prison instead.  Sir, since then, more than 4,000\r\n\r\ndrug  offenders  have been admitted to prison  under  the\r\n\r\nscheme.   The  first long-term prisoner was  released  in\r\n\r\nDecember  2001 and to-date, about 650 of them  have  been\r\n\r\nreleased.   Only  19  of  them  have  since  re-offended.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is still too early to gauge the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof the scheme, the initial results are encouraging.  But,\r\n\r\nstill,  in April last year, MHA further strengthened  the\r\n\r\nscheme   by   extending  community-based   rehabilitation\r\n\r\nprogramme to these long-term imprisonment offenders.   So\r\n\r\nfor  the  last few months, they will still get help  from\r\n\r\nvarious  agencies, including half-way  houses.   To-date,\r\n\r\nabout  250 long-term inmates have been emplaced in  half-way houses with a successful completion rate of 98%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is the drug situation. I want to assure\r\n\r\nMembers that we have things under control, but we do  not\r\n\r\nrest on our laurels.  We recognise these new threats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  indeed will take steps to nip them in the bud.  And,\r\n\r\nof  course,  we  will  continue to  remain  vigilant  and\r\n\r\ncontinue  to monitor the global and regional developments\r\n\r\non  the drug scene.  I believe our multi-pronged approach\r\n\r\nhas borne fruits and we will continue to press on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang has asked what more can be\r\n\r\ndone  to  rehabilitate  sex  offenders  incarcerated   in\r\n\r\nprisons,  the  reformative  training  centres   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Boys' Home.  First, Sir, let me assure  Members\r\n\r\nthat  there are existing programmes in these institutions\r\n\r\nto  rehabilitate sexual offenders.  Such  programmes  are\r\n\r\ngenerally successful in preventing sexual offenders  from\r\n\r\nre-offending.  Out of 156 offenders released from prisons\r\n\r\nsince  the year 2000, only seven have recommitted  a  sex\r\n\r\noffence.  So that is a small percentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prisons Department conducts what is called a 3R\r\n\r\ntreatment programme for sex offenders detained in prisons\r\n\r\nand  the  reformative training centres.   This  programme\r\n\r\naims  to  achieve  the  3Rs  of \"respect,  restraint  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility\"   in  the  individuals  through   empathy\r\n\r\ntraining, victim awareness, relapse prevention and  self-monitoring.  The programme is tailored to the  needs  and\r\n\r\nrisk  profile  of  each  individual  sex  offender.   Sex\r\n\r\noffenders also receive assistance in integrating back  to\r\n\r\nsociety  after  their  release.  A  personalised  relapse\r\n\r\nprevention  plan  is  developed  for  each  offender  and\r\n\r\nreinforced  by  follow-up support sessions.   Eleven  sex\r\n\r\noffenders  have completed the programme since its  launch\r\n\r\nlast  year.  Seven of these have since been released from\r\n\r\nprison and so far, none has re-offended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sex offenders detained in the Singapore Boys'\r\n\r\nHome,  the  Ministry of Community Development and  Sports\r\n\r\nconducts  a  customised programme  called  the  \"Positive\r\n\r\nAdolescence   Sexuality  Treatment\"   (or   PAST).    The\r\n\r\nprogramme  aims  to  develop the  skills,  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nawareness  needed to change the youth's sexual  offending\r\n\r\nbehaviour.  Psychological\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncounselling  is  also provided.  Fourteen offenders  have\r\n\r\nundergone  the  programme since its introduction  in  the\r\n\r\nyear 2000, and so far, none has re-offended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the re-offending rate of sex\r\n\r\noffenders  is very low.  I think we are happy about  that\r\n\r\nand  we  want to ensure that it keeps that way.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  we  always do in MHA, we  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nimprove  our existing programmes, in this case,  for  sex\r\n\r\noffenders  and,  where  necessary,  introduce  new  ones.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  if Prof. Ngiam has some ideas on how to  improve\r\n\r\nour programmes, I would be very  happy to hear from him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I agree with Dr Maliki that we should also help\r\n\r\nex-offenders who come out from prison, particularly those\r\n\r\nwho  are genuine, who really want to find a job.   And  I\r\n\r\nthink  many of us in our MPS will come across cases  like\r\n\r\nthat  - constituents who have served their time, who have\r\n\r\nbeen  punished and who really want to get back on  track,\r\n\r\nincluding  getting emplaced in a job.  Hence, MHA,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  announced, has been reviewing the legal  provisions\r\n\r\nto  allow  a person's criminal record to be removed.   We\r\n\r\nare  studying the experience of other countries  such  as\r\n\r\nthe UK and Hong Kong, which currently have provisions  to\r\n\r\nallow  criminal  records to be rendered spent.   Criminal\r\n\r\nrecord that is rendered spent means that the record  only\r\n\r\nsurfaces  for  court sentencing purposes,  but  he  would\r\n\r\nstill have been considered to have a prior conviction for\r\n\r\nemployment purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, what we are considering is the possibility of\r\n\r\nallowing  a  complete removal of a criminal record,  that\r\n\r\nis,  expunging it.   Because, if implemented, this  would\r\n\r\nmean  that the person whose record is completely  removed\r\n\r\nis  deemed  not  to have been convicted  of  the  offence\r\n\r\nrecorded.   To  a  question in an employment  application\r\n\r\nform  as to whether he has a prior conviction record,  he\r\n\r\ncan   then   reply  `no'.   This  will  be   helpful   in\r\n\r\nrehabilitating  ex-offenders who have genuinely  changed.\r\n\r\nOf  course, this is something which is very rarely  done.\r\n\r\nBut  I think this will really help the offender.  Because\r\n\r\nit is not a matter of whether or not his record\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been spent; in other words, whether it will  surface\r\n\r\nin a court proceeding or whether it is taken out from the\r\n\r\nrecord, but rather to a question in an employment form on\r\n\r\nwhether  he has a prior conviction, if he answers  `yes',\r\n\r\nthen  employers  may still be hesitant.   So,  it  is  an\r\n\r\nintricate thing that we want to study, and we are  taking\r\n\r\nsome time because we want to do as much as we can to help\r\n\r\ngenuine  offenders.  We hope to complete  this,  possibly\r\n\r\nwithin the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChandra Mohan has asked for some elaboration on the  main\r\n\r\ninitiatives for rehabilitative programmes in the  prisons\r\n\r\nand  also how and what we do to provide the best possible\r\n\r\nsecond chance in life for ex-prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as he rightly pointed out, the traditional role\r\n\r\nof  our  prison and its systems is to protect our society\r\n\r\nby  putting criminals who pose a threat to society behind\r\n\r\nbars  and,  at  the  same  time, to  deter  any  would-be\r\n\r\ncriminals.    In  recent  years,  however,  the   Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment  has  done  a lot more to  help  prisoners  to\r\n\r\nreform or rehabilitate themselves.  Programmes have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced  over the last few years to help  rehabilitate\r\n\r\nthem  and  reintegrate offenders back into  society.   We\r\n\r\nhave  seen  that these measures have had some measure  of\r\n\r\nsuccess.  For example, the re-offending rate has declined\r\n\r\nsteadily from about 56% in 1995 to about less than 35% in\r\n\r\nthe  year 2000.  And the Prisons Department has pioneered\r\n\r\nthe   concept   of   CARE  (Community  Action   for   the\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  of  Ex-offenders) which  provides  for  a\r\n\r\nstructured  rehabilitation programme for  offenders  that\r\n\r\nbegins  at admission, and continues beyond their release.\r\n\r\nUpon  admission, inmates are individually assessed and  a\r\n\r\npersonalised  treatment  plan  is  drawn  up  for   them.\r\n\r\nInmates  first  undergo a core skills programme  to  help\r\n\r\nthem  cope  with  their  imprisonment.   Modules  covered\r\n\r\ninclude  self-control, issues arising from  imprisonment,\r\n\r\nstress  management, etc.  Each inmate is also assigned  a\r\n\r\nprison  officer  as  his personal  supervisor.   And  the\r\n\r\noffenders then undergo specialised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntreatment   programmes  targeted  at  specific  offending\r\n\r\nbehaviour.    Offenders  who  wish  to   continue   their\r\n\r\neducation can also be sent to the Prison School which was\r\n\r\nestablished  in the year 2000.  The School  runs  courses\r\n\r\nranging  from  skills  training  up  to  'A'  levels  for\r\n\r\noffenders.   And I am happy to report to this House  that\r\n\r\nprisoners enrolled at the School have constantly achieved\r\n\r\ngood results when they sit for 'N', or 'O', levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suitable offenders are also given the opportunity to\r\n\r\nundertake food training during their stay in prison,  and\r\n\r\ntraining ranging from food preparation, hair dressing  or\r\n\r\nIT  skills  is provided to prepare offenders for  a  wide\r\n\r\nvariety  of  jobs available in the Prison,  or  later  on\r\n\r\noutside.   Besides,  inculcating  good  work  ethics  and\r\n\r\ndiscipline,  such vocational training also  enhances  the\r\n\r\nemployability of offenders after their release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to help ease the often difficult transition\r\n\r\nback   into  society,  the  Home  Detection  Scheme   was\r\n\r\nimplemented  sometime in the year 2000 to allow  selected\r\n\r\noffenders to serve the last few months of their  sentence\r\n\r\nat  home with electronic monitoring.  So far, over  2,000\r\n\r\nhave  benefited from this scheme, and the completion rate\r\n\r\nfor the scheme is almost 100%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the help that we give to offenders does not end\r\n\r\nwith  his release from prison.  In the area of aftercare,\r\n\r\nwe  have  brought  together various  agencies  under  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Action for the Rehabilitation of  Ex-offenders\r\n\r\nnetwork  to  provide aftercare counselling and assistance\r\n\r\nto    released    offenders.    The   network    includes\r\n\r\norganisations,   such   as   the   Singapore    Aftercare\r\n\r\nAssociation  and  Singapore  Anti-Narcotics  Association.\r\n\r\nBoth  help  ex-offenders to return to society during  the\r\n\r\npre-release  phase and continue to support the  offenders\r\n\r\nafter   their  release.   We  also  have  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nCorporation   of   Rehabilitative   Enterprise    (SCORE)\r\n\r\nproviding assistance in job placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prisons Department will continue to work\r\n\r\nwith  the  relevant agencies to improve the effectiveness\r\n\r\nof our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrehabilitation system.  We also need the support  of  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  help  in  the  reintegration   of   the\r\n\r\noffenders  into  society.   Much  will  depend   on   the\r\n\r\nwillingness of Singaporeans to give these ex-offenders  a\r\n\r\nsecond chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chandra Mohan also mentioned about the need\r\n\r\nfor  some  research and study to see the implications  of\r\n\r\nall this.

The  first  has to do with  the  very  positive\r\n\r\nresponse towards the new driving licence, which I  regret\r\n\r\nI  do  not have one.  But I have seen them and they  look\r\n\r\nrather attractive.  The question raised by members of the\r\n\r\npublic was whether we could not have that to replace  our\r\n\r\nIC.   Because after all, the driving licence for citizens\r\n\r\nis  the  same as the IC number.  So why can we  not  have\r\n\r\nthat to replace?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question I have is concerning this: Can\r\n\r\nwe  do  more  with this new driving licence because  they\r\n\r\ncomplain  that  they are having too many cards  in  their\r\n\r\nwallets that, sometimes, they look like they are carrying\r\n\r\na  pack  of playing cards, rather than carrying a wallet.\r\n\r\nThe  question is whether the Ministry of Home Affairs can\r\n\r\ncome   up   with  a  multi-purpose  IC  driving  licence,\r\n\r\ncashcard, everything in one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is a matter of some concern, and it\r\n\r\nhas to do with the privacy of information in the registry\r\n\r\nkept  by  the  Government.  In particular,  I  have  been\r\n\r\napproached  by  parents with adopted  children  who  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  concerns  that, if a natural  mother  has  the\r\n\r\nbirth  certificate  number of the child,  would  she,  in\r\n\r\nlater  years,  be able to trace the whereabouts  of  that\r\n\r\nchild  simply  by  giving the number to any  institution,\r\n\r\nlike the hospital or other institutions?  If so, can such\r\n\r\nadopted  children  be  given new numbers  so  that  their\r\n\r\nidentity   would  be  protected?   These  are   the   two\r\n\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Presently, children born\r\n\r\noverseas  of a Singaporean mother and a foreigner  father\r\n\r\nhave  to  apply  for  citizenship  if  they  want  to  be\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   However, if they are born overseas  to  a\r\n\r\nSingaporean father, they are citizens by descent.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to argue this as a gender issue because I  know\r\n\r\nwhere  this would get us in this House.  Instead, I would\r\n\r\noffer  these  three  reasons why we  should  review  this\r\n\r\nArticle  in  the  Constitution, which was  written  in  a\r\n\r\ntotally different era.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, marriage trends. More Singapore women,\r\n\r\nespecially  our graduates, are marrying foreign  men  and\r\n\r\ngoing overseas.  They have babies overseas and would like\r\n\r\ntheir  children to be Singaporeans.  But because  of  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional hurdle, they face bothersome red tape when\r\n\r\nthey  are  trying to do the patriotic thing.  Ironically,\r\n\r\nthere  are  relatively fewer Singaporean  men  who  marry\r\n\r\nforeign  wives and then have babies overseas.  Yet,  they\r\n\r\nare  given  as a right the convenience of citizenship  by\r\n\r\ndescent for their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, demographic. We are facing falling\r\n\r\nfertility rates.  We do not have enough babies to replace\r\n\r\nourselves.   I would think that we should be  looking  at\r\n\r\nall  manner  of legitimate ways to increase our  pool  of\r\n\r\nbabies  and  to enrich our gene pool.  Allowing  children\r\n\r\nborn  to  Singapore  women overseas  to  be  citizens  by\r\n\r\ndescent would seem to qualify as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third reason, globalisation. We live in an\r\n\r\nincreasingly globalised world and our citizens, both  men\r\n\r\nand  women,  travel and work overseas in rising  numbers.\r\n\r\nWhile  Singaporeans are overseas, they tend to feel  more\r\n\r\npatriotic and conscious of being Singaporeans; some  more\r\n\r\nthan  others.   Such  national  consciousness  is  to  be\r\n\r\nencouraged and we should be appealing to it, rather  than\r\n\r\nmaking it that much harder for a group of Singaporeans  - in  this  case, the women - to nurture it and to pass  on\r\n\r\nthe rights of a citizen to their children by descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his previous reply, the Home Affairs Minister\r\n\r\nsaid   that  although  the  Constitution  has  made  this\r\n\r\ndifferentiation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  men  and women for children born  overseas,  the\r\n\r\npractical  effect  is  not  great.   He  said  that  most\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship of children born overseas to\r\n\r\na  Singaporean parent are approved.  But this is  like  a\r\n\r\nfather saying to his son that his children can enjoy  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of becoming part of the family by descent,  and\r\n\r\ntelling  his daughter that her children have to apply  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  part  of  the family.  And then  adding  that  the\r\n\r\npractical  difference  is not great  as  the  application\r\n\r\nwould probably be approved.  I think, to the daughter, it\r\n\r\nwould  make  all  the difference between feeling  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  part of the family or not.  I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinister to review this policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I am not quite sure the Ministry of Home Affairs is\r\n\r\nthe  correct Ministry to address my point.  But since  it\r\n\r\nis  redirected from the Prime Minister's Office  to  this\r\n\r\nMinistry, here it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained recently in the Budget debate, there\r\n\r\nmust  be  greater benefits for our citizens than  foreign\r\n\r\nnationals  working  here.   Singapore  citizenship   must\r\n\r\nentail  greater privilege than just legal status,  rights\r\n\r\nand  responsibilities.  We need to  offer  citizens  more\r\n\r\nthan what non-citizens can get.  Encouraging citizens  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  sense  of emotional rootedness  to  Singapore\r\n\r\ncannot  be  effective  when the  Government  is  actively\r\n\r\nencouraging skilled and semi-skilled foreign workers  and\r\n\r\ntalents  into Singapore to compete with Singaporeans  for\r\n\r\nthat   premium   jobs.   This  is  especially   so   when\r\n\r\nunemployment  is at its highest.  And for male  citizens,\r\n\r\nthey have to give up 21/2 years of their lives to protect\r\n\r\nour  land.   On  top of that, there are a  few  weeks  of\r\n\r\nreservist training every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there must be strong economic and social\r\n\r\nreasons for Singaporeans to be proud to want to remain as\r\n\r\na Singapore citizen.  My proposal is, Sir, over and above\r\n\r\nthe  tax  rebates, the ERS and the New Singapore  Shares,\r\n\r\ncitizens  should  also  get a  few  percentage  lower  in\r\n\r\npersonal  tax rate than non-citizens working  here.   For\r\n\r\nmen with active NS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nliability, they should get another 2% off their  personal\r\n\r\ntax  rate.  This would give stronger meaning to the  idea\r\n\r\nof  citizenship, that citizens have their  privilege  and\r\n\r\nshow   the  Government's  greater  appreciation  of   our\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for social reasons, the Government will do well\r\n\r\nto  go beyond electoral politics to uphold the principles\r\n\r\nand  ideas  enshrined in our National Pledge.  This  will\r\n\r\ngreatly inspire pride in our citizens and give meaning to\r\n\r\nwhat we truly stand for as a society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, Prof. Chin raised two\r\n\r\nquestions.   One  is whether we can combine  the  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  and  other important licences into the  NRIC  so\r\n\r\nthat  it  serves multiple purposes.  Second, whether  new\r\n\r\nregistration numbers can be given to adopted children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform the Member that my Ministry has\r\n\r\nactually  studied whether to combine the driving  licence\r\n\r\nwith  the  NRIC,  prior to introducing  the  new  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  last year.  In fact, we have even gone  further.\r\n\r\nWe have also studied the electronic national registration\r\n\r\nIC  system which will have a chip on the card and it will\r\n\r\nbe able to do multiple services, like what Prof. Chin has\r\n\r\nsuggested  -  cashcard, driving licence, medical  record,\r\n\r\netc.   We looked around and asked many agencies but there\r\n\r\ndoes  not seem to be a demand for this service and it  is\r\n\r\nvery  costly  to  provide such an IC  with  a  chip  that\r\n\r\nperforms  multiple  roles.   That  being  the  case,   we\r\n\r\nabandoned  the project.  But that may not be the  end  of\r\n\r\nit.   We will continue to look at it and see whether,  in\r\n\r\nfuture, there may be a use for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards combining the driving licence with the\r\n\r\nIC,  we actually have gone further than that.  We thought\r\n\r\nof  doing away with the driving licence.  In other words,\r\n\r\nno  need to carry a physical licence - the plastic  card,\r\n\r\nor whatever.  We wanted to consult the people which we do\r\n\r\nfrom  time  to  time.   So  we  had  many  focused  group\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the community, with the residents,  with\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary Singaporeans.  The majority of  them  said,\r\n\r\n\"Please  let  us have the licence.  We like to  keep  the\r\n\r\nlicence.  We rather not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo  without one.\"  They are afraid to leave home  without\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have the NRIC and the new driving licence. We\r\n\r\ndid  not want to combine the new driving licence with the\r\n\r\nNRIC,   because  the  driving  licence  is   subject   to\r\n\r\nrevocation.  If something happens to the driver, he  does\r\n\r\nnot drive cautiously and the court were to debar him from\r\n\r\ndriving, the licence will have to be revoked.  Then  what\r\n\r\nhappens?  We would have to give back his NRIC.  Or if  he\r\n\r\ntakes  up another class of licence, what happens  to  his\r\n\r\nNRIC?   We have to call him back and put another  sticker\r\n\r\nto  it,  or change his NRIC.  So it is a bit complicated.\r\n\r\nOr  even  when his licence is suspended, we have to  take\r\n\r\nback  his  licence  and say, \"Now,  you  don't  have  the\r\n\r\nlicence  for three months.\"  What does he do in  between?\r\n\r\nHere,  he must have something to identify himself  if  he\r\n\r\nneeds  to  go to the authorities or the bank for whatever\r\n\r\nservices.   So we decided to simplify it by  just  having\r\n\r\nthe NRIC as the NRIC and have the new driving licence  as\r\n\r\na  new  driving licence.  Now, it is much more convenient\r\n\r\nfor  people to have the licence.  The new driving licence\r\n\r\nis for a life-time.  Licence holders pay $50 and they can\r\n\r\nkeep the licence for life.  So please do take care of it.\r\n\r\nBecause  if  they  lose  it,  they  have  got  to  pay  a\r\n\r\nreplacement fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question on new registration numbers\r\n\r\nfor  adopted  children, in my view, the existing  system,\r\n\r\nwhile not perfect, minimises the likelihood of an adopted\r\n\r\nchild's identity being divulged.  Although the child born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore retains the same birth registration  number\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is  re-registered after adoption,  he  actually\r\n\r\nreceives   a  new  birth  certificate  that   shows   the\r\n\r\nparticulars  of  his  adoptive parents.   His  new  birth\r\n\r\nrecord after adoption is no longer linked to that of  his\r\n\r\nnatural  parents.  His original birth record  would  form\r\n\r\npart   of  the  adoption  register  which  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImmigration and Registration will not disclose or release\r\n\r\nto anyone.  So, it is a completely new birth certificate,\r\n\r\nwith the adoptive parents' names on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it better to give a new number? Maybe giving a\r\n\r\nnew  number  may make it more difficult for  the  child's\r\n\r\nnatural parents to trace the child.  But the drawback  of\r\n\r\nthis  is  that  the  adopted  child  would  get  a  birth\r\n\r\nregistration  that  is  out of sequence  with  the  birth\r\n\r\nregistration  numbers  of other children,  because  birth\r\n\r\nregistration  numbers  are  assigned  according  to   the\r\n\r\nsequence of birth and registration.  Therefore, we should\r\n\r\nkeep  it  that  way rather than to change  unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  a new number that shows a child registered  much\r\n\r\nlater when he is actually born in the earlier part of the\r\n\r\nyear may give away his identity.  So, we decided that  we\r\n\r\nshould  keep  to  the present system.   This  system  has\r\n\r\nserved us well for a long time and I do not think we need\r\n\r\nto  change it at all.  For 23 years we have not  received\r\n\r\nany adverse comments on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng's reasons for changing the Constitution\r\n\r\nto  treat  women  and men who marry foreigners,  and  for\r\n\r\nwomen who give birth to children overseas, equally  as  a\r\n\r\nSingapore man who marries a foreigner are understandable.\r\n\r\nI  am sympathetic to her reasons.  But when we change the\r\n\r\nConstitution,  it is a serious matter.   There  are  good\r\n\r\nreasons  why  we  have our present  system.   Ours  is  a\r\n\r\npatrilineal society, just as a child follows the father's\r\n\r\nsurname,  citizen by descent is also tied to the father's\r\n\r\nnationality.   But my Ministry has already  undertaken  a\r\n\r\nreview of this, and we are looking at all our citizenship\r\n\r\nlaws  to  ensure that they keep abreast of the times  for\r\n\r\nsome  of  the reasons mentioned by Ms Irene Ng.  But  any\r\n\r\nchange    would   have   significant   and   far-reaching\r\n\r\nconsequences and implications.  We not only have to amend\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution, we have to take into account the other\r\n\r\nimplications.   And  we will make changes  only  after  a\r\n\r\nthorough review.  So, a review is in hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia was wondering whether I am the correct\r\n\r\nperson  or  whether the Ministry of Home Affairs  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  answer his cut.  Even if this  were  to  be\r\n\r\nunder PMO, as he originally intended, I believe the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister will ask me to answer this question.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  citizenship, since anything that  looks  like\r\n\r\ncitizenship matters, it comes under the Ministry of  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs.  So, he will get the same answer, whether it  is\r\n\r\nlisted under PMO or MHA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, Mr Chia talked about social and\r\n\r\neconomic  reasons why people want to become Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nFor social reasons, he suggested that we should give full\r\n\r\nmeaning  to the Pledge.  We do.  All citizens are treated\r\n\r\nequally  as provided for in the Constitution.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  have not made any distinction.  Otherwise, it will be\r\n\r\nin  violation of the Constitution.  For economic reasons,\r\n\r\nI  hope  people  do not become citizens just  because  of\r\n\r\neconomic gains.  That would be the wrong reason to do so.\r\n\r\nThey  come here because it is a good place to  be  in  to\r\n\r\nbring up their children, to work, to make friends and  to\r\n\r\nbuild their ties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his suggestion to grant special tax rates\r\n\r\nfor  citizens versus non-citizens, I am afraid I have  to\r\n\r\ntell   him   that  under  international  law,   eg,   the\r\n\r\nOrganisation  for  Economic Cooperation  and  Development\r\n\r\nModel  Tax  Convention, we cannot have discrimination  on\r\n\r\ntax  on  account  of  nationality.  Violating  this  will\r\n\r\nadversely  affect  the international agreements  that  we\r\n\r\nhave signed.  Instead, we have found other ways of giving\r\n\r\ncitizens  more in return.  We have given them  more  than\r\n\r\nwhat  we  normally  would have given a  non-citizen,  and\r\n\r\nthese  are  in  the form of tax rebates  and  reliefs  to\r\n\r\ncitizens.  For example, for NSmen who have done  National\r\n\r\nService  -  and  that is where we talk about  recognising\r\n\r\npeople  who have contributed to National Service -  they,\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  and  spouses receive  tax  reliefs.  Non-citizens  do  not.   Procreation tax  rebates  of  up  to\r\n\r\n$20,000  per child are only available to the  parents  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  citizens.   The Government  has  also  treated\r\n\r\ncitizens differently in education, health, public housing\r\n\r\nand,  in the last many years, as Mr Steve Chia cited,  we\r\n\r\nhave  given CPF and Medisave top-ups, Singapore  Telecoms\r\n\r\nshares, New\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Shares,  Economic Restructuring  Shares.   And\r\n\r\nNSmen receive more in quantum than non-citizens and  non-NSmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to talk about privileges and to\r\n\r\ncalculate  whether to benefit more or not by  becoming  a\r\n\r\ncitizen.   Instead of asking what benefits a  citizen  is\r\n\r\nentitled to, I think the Member ought to examine  how  he\r\n\r\nand  every other Singaporean can contribute to  home  and\r\n\r\ncountry.   Being  Singaporean is about  having  a  shared\r\n\r\nsense  of  pride and belonging to our country.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  where our family, friends and hopes are.  All of  us,\r\n\r\nas  Singaporeans, we believe in the Singapore way of life\r\n\r\nand  our  shared  values,  ie, our  multi-racial,  multi-religious  society,  meritocracy,  compassion,   justice,\r\n\r\nequality,  hard  work, determination, a safe  and  secure\r\n\r\nbest  home.  Indeed, there is a deep sense  of  emotional\r\n\r\nrootedness amongst Singaporeans that ties them  together.\r\n\r\nAlthough Singapore is a small country, our reputation  is\r\n\r\nexcellent  in  the  world, and this gives  pride  to  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   wherever  they  may  be.  The   Singapore\r\n\r\npassport, for example, is highly valuable, even valued by\r\n\r\nforeigners, because they see this as a reputable country,\r\n\r\nsafe,  secure  and  well-run, and, therefore,  foreigners\r\n\r\ncovet  our  Singapore passports even to  conduct  illegal\r\n\r\nactivities, such as trafficking in people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards National Service, I think Mr Chia must\r\n\r\nnot  undermine  the contributions made  by  our  National\r\n\r\nServicemen.  They have made a sacrifice.  They contribute\r\n\r\nto  Singapore and we must recognise what they  have  done\r\n\r\nthat have ensured our sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, the matter I want\r\n\r\nto raise relates to the Traffic Police.  We heard earlier\r\n\r\ntoday  that  the Minister for Home Affairs has  explained\r\n\r\nthat  the resources of the Home Team are strained because\r\n\r\nof  their  twin  purposes of looking after  security  and\r\n\r\ncrime busting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Police has always stood out, not like a sore\r\n\r\nthumb,  but by itself, because the control of traffic  is\r\n\r\nusually rather different, and police officers trained  in\r\n\r\ntraffic  control  really  do  not  need  other  types  of\r\n\r\ntraining, eg, crime busting and so on, because  it  is  a\r\n\r\ntotally different activity altogether.  In 1998, I raised\r\n\r\nthe  same  issue in the Budget debate, and  I  asked  the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  Traffic Police should  be  in  another\r\n\r\nMinistry, ie, the Ministry of Transport now, or under the\r\n\r\nLTA.   I  should like to know whether there has been  any\r\n\r\nrethinking on this issue, and whether the Home  Team  can\r\n\r\nnow  devote  itself to the needs of security as  well  as\r\n\r\ncrime busting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong is not here.

If  I\r\n\r\ncould just quote, it says in Article 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Subject to clauses (2) and (3) -\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to\r\n\r\nfreedom of speech and expression;\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) all citizens of Singapore have the right to\r\n\r\nassemble peaceably and without arms; and\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) all citizens of Singapore have the right to\r\n\r\nform associations.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nAnd  there  are  some restrictions to that under  Article\r\n\r\n14(2)  and (3), especially on the full licence of freedom\r\n\r\nin terms of what needs to be done in order to protect the\r\n\r\nsecurity of Singapore, public order or morality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many in Singapore do complain that there are many\r\n\r\nrestrictions imposed by the Government although there are\r\n\r\nfundamental  liberties guaranteed by the Constitution  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If  there  are  too  many  restrictions   or\r\n\r\nexceptions  which affect Article 14 of the  Constitution,\r\n\r\nthen  the  citizens may be justified in complaining  that\r\n\r\ntheir fundamental rights have been curtailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask whether the Ministry would\r\n\r\nconsider  taking steps or initiatives - and I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwould  -  to organise a forum, seminar or even a  closed-door  session  to  review the Societies Act  and  related\r\n\r\nstatutes   and  rules  and  regulations,  together   with\r\n\r\ninterested   parties,   such  as  registered   societies,\r\n\r\nespecially  civic and non-governmental organisations,  to\r\n\r\nsee  what needs to be done so that there is a more active\r\n\r\nand   vibrant   civil  society,  and  greater   voluntary\r\n\r\nactivities  in  Singapore.  We ought  to  tap  the  great\r\n\r\nreservoir of energy of voluntarism from them, and I  hope\r\n\r\nwe will certainly want to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the role of the Registrar of Societies also be\r\n\r\nexpanded  to  task him with creating a greater  level  of\r\n\r\nparticipation  on  such matters?  There  needs  to  be  a\r\n\r\nrethinking  on this.  I would like to ask  what  are  the\r\n\r\nduties and roles of the Registrar currently, and what can\r\n\r\nbe done in order to vest him with greater powers to bring\r\n\r\nabout greater interaction by the Registrar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Societies with civic organisations, so that there  is\r\n\r\ngreater  participation by the community  in  governmental\r\n\r\naffairs   too.   How  can  the  Registrar   enhance   the\r\n\r\nactivities  of non-governmental organisations  and  civic\r\n\r\nsocieties in Singapore as a whole?  Perhaps, the Registry\r\n\r\ncould also look at possibilities of financing some of the\r\n\r\ncommon  projects that can be enhanced to  bring  about  a\r\n\r\ngreater image as a caring, people-oriented group to  help\r\n\r\nthe  Government and the community in various projects and\r\n\r\nprovide  some form of meeting place for seminars,  forums\r\n\r\nas   most   civic  groups  and  organisations  lack   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  and  finances  to  do  so.    What   is   the\r\n\r\nexperience of other jurisidictions, as far as NGOs go and\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations in other countries?  I think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to bring about a synergy of the people  through\r\n\r\nthese organisations with the powers that be, so that they\r\n\r\ncan  be  given a chance to do community work and  special\r\n\r\nprojects  as  per  the aims and objects  found  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective constitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of public expressions and speaking\r\n\r\nrights,   Sir,   there  have  been  recent  developments,\r\n\r\nespecially  on  the issue of potential US-Iraq  war.   We\r\n\r\nhave seen a lot of peaceful demonstrations throughout the\r\n\r\nworld  but,  in a sense, Singapore has not  shown  active\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  that area.  Some would  complain  that\r\n\r\nbecause  of the requirement for a police permit, it  does\r\n\r\ncurtail any form of initiation by civil groups to do such\r\n\r\nthings.   It may be argued that it is not necessary  but,\r\n\r\nsometimes, it is important to express one's feelings, not\r\n\r\njust   in   newspapers,  but  in  the  form  of  peaceful\r\n\r\ndemonstrations.  Generally,  Singaporeans  are   peaceful\r\n\r\npeople. There should not be the perceived fear that there\r\n\r\nwould  be  violence and things would go wrong.   Citizens\r\n\r\nmust  be given the right to do these things.  We  have  a\r\n\r\nstrong  police force that can easily contain, if at  all,\r\n\r\nproblems  should arise.  I would encourage the Government\r\n\r\nto be a bit more liberal about these things and certainly\r\n\r\nbe more liberal about the granting of police permits, and\r\n\r\nbetter  still,  why the need for such police  permits  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, in terms of expression, we have the\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner.  I must admit in this regard  that  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  have  not responded very positively.   Perhaps,\r\n\r\nthis  should be reviewed.  Is it because of the  location\r\n\r\nitself and the forms of restrictions imposed on people to\r\n\r\nspeak up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir,  for the opportunity to speak on  this  issue.\r\n\r\nThere  is right now another kind of war that is going  on\r\n\r\nand  has been going on for some time, and I think the sad\r\n\r\nthing about this is not many of us are even aware of  it.\r\n\r\nI  am  referring to the trafficking of people around  the\r\n\r\nworld in this discussion, particularly that of women  and\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of trafficking is tipped to eclipse the\r\n\r\narms  and drug trade as the most lucrative aspect of this\r\n\r\ntrafficking phenomenon is that of sexual exploitation  of\r\n\r\nwomen  and  children.  According to the  United  Nations'\r\n\r\nestimates,  trafficking of just women and children  alone\r\n\r\nright  now  involves about four million  people  a  year,\r\n\r\nbringing in a record profit of US$5-7 million.   Of  this\r\n\r\nconservative  figure, about 250,000 women  and  children,\r\n\r\naccording  to  the latest International Organisation  for\r\n\r\nMigration  Report, come from South-east  Asia.   One  may\r\n\r\nask:   what  has  all  this got  to  do  with  Singapore?\r\n\r\nPlenty, I say, and allow me to express why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Singaporeans are a well-travelled group.\r\n\r\nWe  travel  in the region and beyond.  UN's  figures  for\r\n\r\nchild  sex tourism in Cambodia show that it is coming  up\r\n\r\nto  35%, more than 5,000 young girls from Yunnan province\r\n\r\nare  trafficked and serving in the brothels  in  Bangkok.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  1998/1999 figure, so it is outdated,  but  I\r\n\r\ncould  not find the latest figure.  Some hotels in  Bali,\r\n\r\nPhilippines  and Sri Lanka promote sex with  children  as\r\n\r\npart  of  their  attraction and today, in each  of  these\r\n\r\nrespective countries, 60,000-100,000 children are kept in\r\n\r\nbrothels.   Please  note  that  I  am  not  saying   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  visit these countries to partake  in  these\r\n\r\nactivities.  But what I am saying is that we cannot  rule\r\n\r\nout this possibility either.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also have many foreign workers amongst\r\n\r\nus.  Many have work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermits but there is also still a group among the foreign\r\n\r\nworkers who are illegals, sometimes taking on menial jobs\r\n\r\nor sometimes working here as prostitutes.  Do we know how\r\n\r\nthey landed here?  Do we know whether they came willingly\r\n\r\nor  they  were duped?  Do we know if they are  trafficked\r\n\r\npersons?    But   the  way  to  finding  what   are   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances that brought them here, we do have a little\r\n\r\nbit  of  a hurdle because under the Immigration  Act,  if\r\n\r\nthey are found to be illegal, they can be either caned or\r\n\r\nsent  to  prison  or both.  However,  there  is  still  a\r\n\r\nrecourse  that  some  of them can turn  into  prosecution\r\n\r\nwitnesses  to  haul in the traffickers.  But  what  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  here is that the obstacle is there that we  would\r\n\r\nperhaps   sometimes  not  even  know  whether  they   are\r\n\r\ntrafficked individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and more importantly, as to why Singapore is\r\n\r\ninvolved in this business of trafficking of people around\r\n\r\nthe  world,  the  latest report in the  Sunday  Times  by\r\n\r\nreporter  Arlina  Arshad showed that Singapore  men  have\r\n\r\nbeen  making a beeline for some time for the Riau Islands\r\n\r\nfor  the  Indonesian girls.  And in her story,  she  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that some of them are as young as 12. A Riau Island\r\n\r\nparliamentarian whom I spoke to also confirmed that  many\r\n\r\nof  these  girls are from villages, lured and  forced  to\r\n\r\nstay in brothels, and in the weekly raids that his Police\r\n\r\nforce  is  carrying out, it is a fact that some  of  them\r\n\r\nhave  been  duped into the brothel service  and  some  of\r\n\r\nthese brothels are also businesses run by Singaporeans in\r\n\r\nBatam and Bintan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all joked, cynically, often, I am sure,\r\n\r\nabout the weekend migration of our men to the islands  of\r\n\r\nBatam and Bintan.  But today, I want to be a party-pooper\r\n\r\nand say that this has to stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has ratified the Convention on the Rights\r\n\r\nof  the  Child  whereby Articles 34  and  35  state  that\r\n\r\ngovernments shall take all appropriate action to  protect\r\n\r\nchildren  from sexual exploitation.  We have not ratified\r\n\r\nthe optional protocol dealing with child prostitution yet\r\n\r\nunder this Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Ms Braema, you have to wrap up your\r\n\r\nspeech soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Okay.

The question I\r\n\r\nhave  for the Ministry then is that, since we have signed\r\n\r\nall  these documents, how can the Home Team work with the\r\n\r\nofficials in Indonesia to try and curtail this situation.\r\n\r\nIs  it  also time for us to do what the Australians  have\r\n\r\ndone  to try and bring our citizens a little bit more  in\r\n\r\nline with our own home laws?  My second question is:   is\r\n\r\nit  time  also to review how we look at illegals  because\r\n\r\nthe  world  right  now is trying to  decriminalise  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit, having the understanding that some  of  them\r\n\r\nare  victims  of  trafficking?  Thirdly, we  have  signed\r\n\r\ndifferent Conventions from different Ministries  as  part\r\n\r\nof  our stand.  Do these Conventions harmonise at the end\r\n\r\nof the day and, if so, what is our stand?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in conclusion, Sir, we are living in a\r\n\r\nglobalised   world  which  means  dealing   with   global\r\n\r\nproblems.   It  is my hope that our men do  us  proud  in\r\n\r\nevery  sense of the word and, as a Government, we  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to look the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Guillotine. Please sit down, Ms\r\n\r\nBraema.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, I join the call\r\n\r\nearlier by NMP Mr Chandra Mohan.  I find it strange  that\r\n\r\nwe  need so many permits in Singapore - permit to  speak,\r\n\r\npermit to entertain, permit to march,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermit  to  protest and even a permit to gather.   It  is\r\n\r\nabsurd  if your group has more than five people, you  can\r\n\r\nbe charged for illegal assembly.  Many Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nbe guilty of that offence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules, permits and licences are mental roadblocks\r\n\r\nthat  restrict  the  growth of  a  creative  and  vibrant\r\n\r\nsociety. This point has been well-hammered into the minds\r\n\r\nof the Government and the civil service over the last few\r\n\r\ndays  by  many  MPs.  I do not think I  need  to  go  any\r\n\r\nfurther since the DPM has personally pledged to cut  down\r\n\r\non the number of rules, permits and licences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just hope that the Home Affairs Ministry would\r\n\r\ncooperate fully by removing those unnecessary permits and\r\n\r\nlaws  that are archaic and no longer relevant. Stop using\r\n\r\nthe  standard excuse of public safety and security as the\r\n\r\nawe-inspiring reason to keep these rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe  Government can do better than giving us  a  standard\r\n\r\nreply.  It is time to return more freedom to the citizens\r\n\r\nso  that  they  can  learn to exercise  greater  personal\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first let me respond\r\n\r\nto  Prof. Chin's point.  His point is very specific.   He\r\n\r\nhas  made a renewed call for Traffic Police to be  merged\r\n\r\nwith the Land Transport Authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me inform him that his call has not fallen on\r\n\r\ndeaf  ears  because discussions are now underway  between\r\n\r\nMHA  and the Ministry of Transport and we plan to  effect\r\n\r\nthe transfer by the middle of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, traffic management and control\r\n\r\ntoday  come  under  two agencies,  namely,  LTA  and  the\r\n\r\nTraffic   Police.   This  has  resulted  in   unnecessary\r\n\r\ncoordination issues.  Other than the reason  that  if  we\r\n\r\ntake  away  Traffic Police from MHA agencies,  MHA  would\r\n\r\nthen  be  able  to  concentrate more  on  law  and  order\r\n\r\nproblems,  the  more positive rationale,  and  one  which\r\n\r\nwould  benefit Singaporeans, will be that there  will  be\r\n\r\ngreater synergy if this is done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite a few examples. First, duplication of\r\n\r\ntechnology can be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToday,  LTA locates cameras at the traffic junctions  and\r\n\r\nthe  expressways  and tunnels to monitor  traffic  flows.\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police,  on the other hand, separately  operates\r\n\r\nthe  red  light and speed camera systems for surveillance\r\n\r\nagainst   specific  traffic  offences.   There  is   much\r\n\r\npotential  therefore in streamlining these systems.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  a camera system can be developed for  both  the\r\n\r\nmonitoring  of  traffic  at  major  junctions   and   for\r\n\r\nsurveillance against red light offences.  Duplication  of\r\n\r\nsystems  can  therefore  be avoided,  resulting  in  cost\r\n\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, enforcement can be streamlined. Today,\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  enforces  traffic  violations  such   as\r\n\r\nspeeding.   On  the  other  hand,  LTA  enforces  illegal\r\n\r\nmodifications    to    vehicles.     However,     illegal\r\n\r\nmodifications also compromise road safety.  So  there  is\r\n\r\nsome  overlap  there.  For instance,  a  driver  who  has\r\n\r\ninstalled tinted glass windows may find it hard to see on-coming traffic clearly and thus overtake dangerously.  It\r\n\r\nis  counter-productive  for  Traffic  Police  or  LTA  to\r\n\r\nenforce  against  one  offence, whether  it  is  reckless\r\n\r\ndriving or illegal modification, without also having  the\r\n\r\nauthority   to  enforce  the  other.   Such   gaps   only\r\n\r\ncompromise safety on our roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the setting of rules and the downstream\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  these rules.  For example,  as  part  of\r\n\r\nLTA's measures to encourage usage of public transport, it\r\n\r\nis  an  offence to drive in a bus lane during peak hours.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is Traffic Police's responsibility to process\r\n\r\nthe  summonses, impose demerit points and also attend  to\r\n\r\nappeals   for   such   violations.    This   is   clearly\r\n\r\nundesirable,  as the agency responsible for defining  the\r\n\r\nrules should also enforce the rules to ensure consistency\r\n\r\nfrom   policy   formulation  to  downstream  enforcement.\r\n\r\nHence,  by integrating all traffic issues under a  single\r\n\r\nagency,  the  enlarged LTA will be able to  offer  better\r\n\r\nservice  to all road-users.  LTA will then have a  direct\r\n\r\nhand  in  influencing road-user behaviour, and strengthen\r\n\r\nits  own  mission of creating an excellent land transport\r\n\r\nsystem.  MHA officials and officials from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nTransport have made good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress  at  the  working level  and  we  will  announce\r\n\r\nspecific details of the transfer when these are ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Steve\r\n\r\nChia's  points.  Both Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Steve  Chia\r\n\r\nmade  a  call,  for  example, for more opportunities  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to speak in public.  Mr Steve Chia's  point\r\n\r\nis  that of the number of licences and permits that  must\r\n\r\nbe  applied  for.   First, I want to  say  this.   As  Mr\r\n\r\nChandra   Mohan  himself  has  said,  yes,  we  do   have\r\n\r\nfundamental rights and liberties in the Constitution, and\r\n\r\nhe  has mentioned some of these.  But, at the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe same Articles in the Constitution also set parameters\r\n\r\n-   security, public order, morality.  I think Mr Chandra\r\n\r\nMohan, in his speech, also recognises that Singapore is a\r\n\r\nunique   society,  special  in  a  very   small   country\r\n\r\nphysically, compact, and we are also multi-racial, multi-religious.  Therefore, working the Constitution, we  have\r\n\r\nto  derive  positions which take into  consideration  and\r\n\r\nrecognise the situation in Singapore.  And, indeed, every\r\n\r\ncountry  has  to strike a delicate balance between  these\r\n\r\nfundamental liberties on the one hand, and law and  order\r\n\r\nconcerns  on  the other.  Therefore, it  is  not  just  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of saying why can other countries do it, why  can\r\n\r\nwe  not do it.  Because circumstances are different,  eg,\r\n\r\nour historical experiences are different.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked why can we not have peaceful\r\n\r\ndemonstrations. There is, in fact, contradiction in terms\r\n\r\nthere,  because  large gatherings  of  people  can  start\r\n\r\npeaceful but can turn violent, particularly if it  is  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of  race, religion or politics, where  different\r\n\r\npeople  may have different opinions and different  groups\r\n\r\nmay  gather,  then you will have clashes.   And,  indeed,\r\n\r\neven  in other countries with regard to this latest spate\r\n\r\nof  gatherings on the possibility of a war in Iraq,  some\r\n\r\nof  the demonstrations have turned violent.  So, I  think\r\n\r\nwe have to be careful there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, our position all these years has been clear.\r\n\r\nPolice will not allow public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalks  on matters such as race, religion and politics  to\r\n\r\nbe given in open spaces as they may cause disaffection or\r\n\r\nelicit  mock  response  when  inflammatory  speeches  are\r\n\r\ngiven.   But  meetings can be held indoors or  in  sports\r\n\r\nstadiums where the conditions are different and there  is\r\n\r\nbetter control, and the concerns of law and order can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  taken care of.  The Police also disallows  public\r\n\r\nassemblies if public order may be compromised.  Likewise,\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar  of Societies will refuse registration  of\r\n\r\ngroups  that are prejudicial to public order or  national\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, I think we must give credit where\r\n\r\nit  is due, and this is that the Police and the Registrar\r\n\r\nof  Societies exercise their discretion judiciously under\r\n\r\nthe   Public   Entertainments  and  Meetings   Act,   the\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Offences Act and the Societies Act.  Police\r\n\r\nand the Registrar of Societies administer these Acts even-handedly  and  with  a light touch.   Let  me  cite  some\r\n\r\nfigures.   Over  the  two-year period, 2001-2002,  Police\r\n\r\napproved   1,403  applications  for  public  talks,   and\r\n\r\nrejected only four such applications.  In other words,  a\r\n\r\nhigh  approval  rate of 99.7%.  Of the four applications,\r\n\r\nthree  were  rejected because of law and order  concerns,\r\n\r\nwhile   the  remaining  one  was  rejected  because   the\r\n\r\napplication was made on the eve of the intended event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan must surely appreciate the fact\r\n\r\nthat  rules have been relaxed, and I say this also to  Mr\r\n\r\nSteve Chia who made that point because, over time, Police\r\n\r\nalso   reassesses  changed  conditions  and   where   the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  relaxation  comes  in,  that   can   be\r\n\r\nconsidered.    For   example,   since   September   2000,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can speak at the Speakers'  Corner  without\r\n\r\nthe  need for a public entertainment licence.  That is  a\r\n\r\nmajor  relaxation.   And, indeed, recently,  a  political\r\n\r\nassociation  held an installation art exhibition  at  the\r\n\r\nSpeakers' Corner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan asked how other countries handle\r\n\r\npublic  expressions and what the international  community\r\n\r\nand  media think about us. Like I have said, we  have  to\r\n\r\nformulate  rules  to  fit  Singapore  because,  basically\r\n\r\nessential and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nultimately, it is the safety and security of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthat  really  matter and, of course,  for  investors  and\r\n\r\ntourists who are here.  Here again, I think Singapore has\r\n\r\nscored very well in terms of public safety for many years\r\n\r\nat  international polls.  I think we must  maintain  this\r\n\r\nposition.  In fact, other countries probably look  at  us\r\n\r\nand  wonder how we do it.  So, before we throw  the  baby\r\n\r\nout  with  the  bathwater, let us have a care.   And  for\r\n\r\nthese reasons, Singaporeans enjoy a great sense of safety\r\n\r\nand  security.  Of course, in terms of history  also,  we\r\n\r\nrecall  turbulent times in the past.  Though those  times\r\n\r\nmay  be many years away physically in terms of number  of\r\n\r\nyears,  but  given  the make-up of our  society,  it  can\r\n\r\nresurface if we are not careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan also asked about the Societies Act.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  the Societies Act has been applied  with  a\r\n\r\nlight  touch.   In fact, in MHA, I have said  earlier  on\r\n\r\nwhen I answered earlier questions, we review our Acts and\r\n\r\nmeasures  all  the time to see how they can be  improved.\r\n\r\nAnd,  in  the  same  vein, we have  also  looked  at  the\r\n\r\nSocieties Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rarely has the Registrar had to refuse registration.\r\n\r\nWhen  he  does,  it  is  for  very  good  reasons.    The\r\n\r\nRegistrar, in fact, cites the relevant ground of  refusal\r\n\r\nprovided  under the Act and which clause it comes  under,\r\n\r\neg,  that  the society is likely to be used for  unlawful\r\n\r\npurpose  or for purposes prejudicial to public  peace  or\r\n\r\norder.  So the rejected applicant will know on what basis\r\n\r\nthe  rejection has taken place.  Between 1998  and  2001,\r\n\r\nthe Registrar approved 888 applications and rejected only\r\n\r\n7   applications.   Last  year,  263  applications   were\r\n\r\napproved  and  only  3 applications, from  two  religious\r\n\r\ngroups  and a third group suspected of being involved  in\r\n\r\nsecret  society activities, were rejected.   So,  indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  number of registered societies has grown from  5,377\r\n\r\nin 1999 to 5,642 as at end of last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward and taking a pro-active stance, ROS\r\n\r\nhas  been experimenting since January 2002 with  a  fast-track registration scheme for societies that pose minimal\r\n\r\nlaw and order, safety and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsecurity concerns.  These societies can be registered  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis  of  the  applicant  self-declaring  that  the\r\n\r\nsociety  meets  certain  criteria.   For  instance,   its\r\n\r\nobjects  and  activities  must not  relate  to  politics,\r\n\r\nreligion  and  ethnicity, and it must  not  have  foreign\r\n\r\nconnections.  These are well grounded reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we are considering whether and how we can allow\r\n\r\neligible  societies to be registered automatically.   So,\r\n\r\nwe  are trying to improve all the time.  I think that  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  Mr  Chandra Mohan and  others  like  him\r\n\r\nshould appreciate.  So, there is really no need to hold a\r\n\r\nbig  seminar  where  we  take  feedback  from  everybody,\r\n\r\nbecause we are always open to feedback.  I myself,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  he would know, have also met some groups to discuss\r\n\r\nthe Societies Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan suggested that the Registrar of\r\n\r\nSocieties  should  play a bigger role in  enhancing  and,\r\n\r\nindeed,  even  in financing the activities  of  NGOs  and\r\n\r\ncivil  society groups.  I think he should think carefully\r\n\r\nabout  this  call, because it is really not a wise  move.\r\n\r\nWhy?    Because  these  NGOs  who  seek  help  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  may  lose their credibility.   Civil  society\r\n\r\ngroups  must  make themselves relevant  and  be  able  to\r\n\r\nengage  and  convince  citizens to  identify  with  their\r\n\r\ncauses.   It  is  not true that NGOs find  difficulty  in\r\n\r\ngetting premises to hold meetings and so forth.  Over the\r\n\r\npast few years, civil society in Singapore has grown, and\r\n\r\nNGOs  espousing  various causes have sprung  up.   So,  I\r\n\r\nthink  we should leave them be.  There is space for  them\r\n\r\nto grow.  The ROS is certainly not an instrument to clamp\r\n\r\nthem  down.  And like I have said, from the  figures  and\r\n\r\nfrom  our  approach, in fact, we are  pro-societies.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,   the  Registrar  of  Societies  must  have   the\r\n\r\ndiscretion   to  act  against  societies;   hence,   even\r\n\r\nconstitutionally, law and order and other parameters  are\r\n\r\nset out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Steve Chia has talked about permits. Like I have\r\n\r\nexplained  just now, there is a need for  us  to  control\r\n\r\ngatherings  of  large  people in  Singapore.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for a permit if you want to hold a large\r\n\r\nmeeting in public.  As shown by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfigures given just now, it is not difficult to apply  for\r\n\r\na  permit  and, particularly, in the context  of  meeting\r\n\r\nrooms and sports stadiums, they have been granted before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about licences. Here again, MHA\r\n\r\nadministers this matter with a light touch.  For example,\r\n\r\nPolice, currently, administers licences and permits under\r\n\r\nnine  pieces of legislation.  We have considered  whether\r\n\r\nor  not  such pieces of legislation are necessary and  we\r\n\r\nhave found them to be so.  Let me give you an example  of\r\n\r\nthe  Arms and Explosives Act.  There is a need to control\r\n\r\nthe  importation  and possession of arms and  explosives.\r\n\r\nI  think Mr Chia will agree that we need to continue with\r\n\r\nthis  regime.   Likewise, the Private  Investigation  and\r\n\r\nSecurity Agencies Act, so that anyone who wants to  be  a\r\n\r\nprivate  investigator or security guard will have  to  be\r\n\r\nscreened.   So,  there is every reason why  a  permit  is\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about public activities, which Mr Chia has\r\n\r\nfocused  on?   Let  me say there are 15 types  of  public\r\n\r\nentertainment    licences   catering   to   entertainment\r\n\r\nbusinesses  and  to  those who wish to  organise  ad  hoc\r\n\r\npublic  entertainment.  These licences are, for  example,\r\n\r\nfor   performance  of  public  talks  and  for  operating\r\n\r\nbilliard  saloons and games machines.  If  Mr  Chia  sits\r\n\r\nback  and thinks about it, there is every reason  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  require  these licences, not that  they  are  not\r\n\r\ngranted.   When the conditions are met, they are granted.\r\n\r\nFor example, control over computer games arcades and pubs\r\n\r\nare required, so that on application, Police can look  at\r\n\r\nit  and  see whether, eg, they are in residential  areas,\r\n\r\ntoo  near  to HDB areas, thus posing social concerns  and\r\n\r\npossibly  too  accessible to the young people.   Or,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  whether  or  not  large  outdoor  entertainment\r\n\r\nevents  could be held at a certain place, it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  consider  whether  or not there  will  be  disamenity\r\n\r\ncaused  to  the residents, traffic problems  or  law  and\r\n\r\norder problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure he will appreciate that, over the years,\r\n\r\nhe would have seen MHA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassess the relevancy of licences and, where possible,  we\r\n\r\nhave  done away with some of these licences.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsure whether he was in the House in the year 2000, when I\r\n\r\nmoved  a  Bill  to  amend the Public  Entertainments  and\r\n\r\nMeetings  Act.   Part of the scheme of the  Bill  was  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  an  exemption scheme where certain  activities\r\n\r\nwere  exempted under class exemption.  Hence, under  this\r\n\r\namendment  to  the  Act,  we exempted  10  categories  of\r\n\r\nactivities.  And, indeed, the Speakers' Corner also arose\r\n\r\nfrom  this  exemption.  People who speak at the Speakers'\r\n\r\nCorner will not need to apply for a licence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year, Police implemented a one-stop\r\n\r\npublic  entertainment  licensing centre  (or  OSPEC).   I\r\n\r\nthink  Mr  Chia  is also aware of that,  particularly  in\r\n\r\nhelping   people   who   want  to   start   entertainment\r\n\r\nactivities, pubs, for example.  So OSPEC, in fact,  as  a\r\n\r\none-step centre, has helped to bring down processing time\r\n\r\nto  two weeks. That was about a year-and-a-half ago.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  like I have said, in MHA, we always see  whether\r\n\r\nwe  can  improve  our  processes.  So,  here,  Police  is\r\n\r\ncurrently   looking   at  computerising   its   licensing\r\n\r\noperations.  When the system \"PLUS\" is ready  later  this\r\n\r\nyear,  we  can expect the processing time to  be  further\r\n\r\nreduced  to seven working days for establishment  licence\r\n\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure both Mr Chandra and Mr Steve Chia that\r\n\r\nwhen  licences or permits are imposed, they are for  good\r\n\r\nreasons.  If they are no longer necessary, we will modify\r\n\r\nthem or, in some cases, even remove them, and this is  an\r\n\r\non-going process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi has made several points which are\r\n\r\nnot  quite in line with her topic, because she made quite\r\n\r\ndiverse  points, for example, whether or not we  can  act\r\n\r\nagainst  brothel owners in Bintan and Batam.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nshe  appreciates  that  Bintan  and  Batam  are  out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's criminal jurisdiction.  Certainly,  in  terms\r\n\r\nof what our Police can do, we cannot do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanything.   What,  of  course,  we  can  do  is  we   can\r\n\r\ndiscourage our men from going to visit these  places.   I\r\n\r\nthink, here, families can play a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is whether or not those who come to\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  being  trafficked.   Yes,  indeed,   many\r\n\r\nillegals  come to Singapore; others overstay.  But  those\r\n\r\nillegals who come to Singapore, they come on their own or\r\n\r\nsome  of them are smuggled in.  But that is not the  same\r\n\r\nas  trafficking, because trafficking means that  you  are\r\n\r\nbrought  in against your will.  In the case of foreigners\r\n\r\nwho  enter Singapore illegally, they all come voluntarily\r\n\r\nlooking for a better life.  Some are smuggled in.  As far\r\n\r\nas Singapore is concerned, I think she knows that we take\r\n\r\na  very tough position against all illegals who come,  as\r\n\r\nwell as smugglers or conveyors, as they are called.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  last  year,  about 50 of  such  conveyors  were\r\n\r\narrested   by   us.   We  have,  in  fact,  tough   laws,\r\n\r\nparticularly against such smugglers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for conventions, I think, again, this is a very\r\n\r\nspecific point.  Really, different conventions come under\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministries.  I think the conventions  she  has\r\n\r\nmentioned relating to the children are under the  purview\r\n\r\nof  MCDS.   If she wants to ask a specific question,  she\r\n\r\nshould file a Question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Chia, a short clarification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, first, I would like\r\n\r\nto  thank  the Ministry for the efficiency and  speed  of\r\n\r\napproval.   The  two clarifications I want  to  make  are\r\n\r\nthese.  Where the gathering is five or more people, do we\r\n\r\nneed to apply for a permit?  Because under the law, it is\r\n\r\nconsidered   illegal  assembly.   The   second   question\r\n\r\npertains  to  this.   When  we are  talking  and  meeting\r\n\r\nresidents  at  coffeeshops, and where some topics  become\r\n\r\ninteresting, you can get a crowd around you and the crowd\r\n\r\nsize  can actually increase to quite large, and  in  this\r\n\r\ncase, while we are addressing and talking to them, do  we\r\n\r\nneed to apply for a speaking permit, in a sense?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> On Mr Chia's first point,\r\n\r\nif  somebody  is organising a gathering for  purposes  as\r\n\r\nfollows:   to  demonstrate  support  for  or  against   a\r\n\r\nparticular  view, to publicise a cause or to  commemorate\r\n\r\nor  mark  an event, then it comes under the Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nOffences  Rules, and he will have to apply for a  permit.\r\n\r\nThe  second point is if people gather in coffeeshops,  it\r\n\r\nis  not an unlawful assembly, unless the people have  got\r\n\r\ncriminal  intent and, indeed, go on to commit an offence.\r\n\r\nBecause,  then,  the unlawful assembly provision  in  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  comes in.  So, that is different.   That  is\r\n\r\nanother  provision altogether.  But if people  gather  to\r\n\r\nwatch  a  football  game on TV, say, in  the  S-League  - Woodlands Wellington against Home United - the  law  will\r\n\r\nnot come after them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Could I ask for\r\n\r\nclarification,   please?

We have been grappling with the problem  of\r\n\r\nhigh  relapse rate.  At one time, it was as high as  80%.\r\n\r\nRecently,  it hovered over 60%.  This is still  high,  as\r\n\r\none  out  of  every six addicts returned  to  their  drug\r\n\r\nhabits.   One of the programmes implemented to deal  with\r\n\r\nthe  drug addiction is the Community-based Rehabilitation\r\n\r\n(CBR) Programme The ex-addicts are either home-based  but\r\n\r\ntagged   electronically  or  they  go   through   further\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  at  the  half-way  houses.   The   Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of State for Home Affairs has earlier  reported\r\n\r\nthat  the completion rate for the half-way houses is 98%.\r\n\r\nWhile many complete the programme, I wonder how many have\r\n\r\nrelapsed.  As such, I would like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nis  the  relapse rate for addicts who have undergone  the\r\n\r\nCBR programme since it was implemented.  What other plans\r\n\r\nand  programmes are there in our efforts at reducing  the\r\n\r\nrelapse rate amongst the drug addicts?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the half-way house concept is essentially that\r\n\r\nit  is the half-way mark for ex-drug addicts as they move\r\n\r\nfrom  the institution back home into the arms of society.\r\n\r\nWhen  we  talk  about the Community-based  Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nProgramme,  the  assumption is that we are rehabilitating\r\n\r\nthe  ex-addicts  in the community.  But herein  lies  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  Is the community also being rehabilitated  into\r\n\r\naccepting  these ex-addicts?  I have discussed the  issue\r\n\r\nof  employment  and  how the stigma of  being  an  addict\r\n\r\naffects their potential at seeking employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not too long ago, in fact, just January this\r\n\r\nyear,  we saw how a neighbourhood reacted to the presence\r\n\r\nof  the shelter for ex-addicts called \"The Promised  Land\r\n\r\nMissions\".   They  were  asked  to  leave  because   they\r\n\r\nviolated some URA regulations.  Some in the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nexpressed relief at the group's departure.  But I am glad\r\n\r\nthat there are some others,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlike  Mrs Lisha Holland who countered and remarked, \"Some\r\n\r\nof  the men look a little bit rough with their tattoos on\r\n\r\ntheir  arms.  But if you take time to get to  know  them,\r\n\r\nyou'll   find  that  they  are  nice  people.\"    Another\r\n\r\nneighbour,  Mdm  Ng Chwee Kim, also wrote  and  supported\r\n\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need more people like Mrs Lisha Holland and\r\n\r\nMrs  Ng  in our midst, people who would not judge  others\r\n\r\neasily,  people  who are willing to give second  chances.\r\n\r\nIn  this regard, I would like to ask the Minister if  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  plans  to implement programmes  that  will\r\n\r\nassist  the  community  and the public  in  understanding\r\n\r\nthese  ex-addicts  better  and  thereby  facilitate   the\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  these individuals.  If not,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to consider implementing such programmes.   Such\r\n\r\nacceptance  will  go  a  long  way  in  our  efforts   at\r\n\r\nrehabilitating these addicts and reintegrating them  back\r\n\r\ninto  society and, in the same breath, make  our  society\r\n\r\nmore compassionate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mohamad Maidin B P M:</b> Dr Maliki has asked\r\n\r\nabout    the   effectiveness   of   our   Community-based\r\n\r\nRehabilitation (CBR) Programme.  Sir, this programme  was\r\n\r\nlaunched   sometime  in  1995  and  it   was   aimed   at\r\n\r\nreintegrating  drug offenders detained in our  DRCs  back\r\n\r\ninto  the  community.  Inmates who  are  assessed  to  be\r\n\r\nreceptive  towards the programme are emplaced  either  at\r\n\r\ntheir own homes or at half-way houses at the end of their\r\n\r\ndetention.  Inmates emplaced at home are employed  during\r\n\r\nthe  day  and  must observe curfew hours in the  evening,\r\n\r\nwhile  those  in the half-way houses will attend  various\r\n\r\nrehabilitative  programmes  arranged  by   the   half-way\r\n\r\nhouses.  So far, about 6,000 inmates have benefited  from\r\n\r\nthis programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the results of the CBR programme have been\r\n\r\nencouraging.   The completion rate for  all  the  cohorts\r\n\r\nemplaced  on the programme from 1995 to 2000 has averaged\r\n\r\nabout  82%.   The  recidivism rate of  inmates  who  have\r\n\r\nundergone the programme has also been consistently  lower\r\n\r\nthan those who have not.  For example,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namong  the cohort of drug offenders released in the  year\r\n\r\n2000, the recidivism rate for those who underwent the CBR\r\n\r\nprogramme was 38%, compared to about 60% of those who did\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Members that other inmates in\r\n\r\nthe  DRCs  who may not be suitable for the CBR  programme\r\n\r\nare not forgotten.  They undergo  other programmes within\r\n\r\nthe centre, for example, substance abuse treatment, anger\r\n\r\nmanagement   and   violence  prevention   courses.    The\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  effort, however, does not  end  with  the\r\n\r\ncompletion  of  the CBR programme or the release  of  the\r\n\r\ninmate from our DRC.  Programmes are also put in place to\r\n\r\nhelp the drug offender reintegrate into our society.  And\r\n\r\nthese   include  aftercare  counselling  and   assistance\r\n\r\noffered  by  the  Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative\r\n\r\nEnterprise (SCORE) and the agencies participating in  the\r\n\r\nCommunity  Action for the Rehabilitation of  Ex-offenders\r\n\r\n(CARE) network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the successful rehabilitation of drug\r\n\r\noffenders,  as rightly mentioned by the Member,  requires\r\n\r\nthe support and cooperation of the agencies, the families\r\n\r\nand  friends of the drug offenders as well as society  at\r\n\r\nlarge.  As he has explained, in some incidents where they\r\n\r\nwere not clearly welcomed by some residents, I would like\r\n\r\nto  take  this  opportunity  to  once  again  exhort  all\r\n\r\nconcerned   to   help   our   ex-offenders   successfully\r\n\r\nreintegrate into society and to continue to lead a useful\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to educating our people, Sir, the CNB\r\n\r\nhas  its own preventive education programme reaching  out\r\n\r\nto students in various schools, and I think SANA also has\r\n\r\nits  own  programme to educate the community.  The  other\r\n\r\nprogramme which I mentioned earlier is CARE.  Under CARE,\r\n\r\nthe   various   agencies  believe  that  some   kind   of\r\n\r\ncoordinated  aftercare programme  is  very  good  in  our\r\n\r\neffort to bring the ex-offenders or drug addicts back  to\r\n\r\nsociety.   These programmes, coordinated by  the  Prisons\r\n\r\nDepartment, involving SCORE, National Council  of  Social\r\n\r\nService,   Singapore  Anti-Narcotics   Association,   and\r\n\r\nothers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare   actually   a  network  designed  to  provide   this\r\n\r\nassistance.

I hope  we  can  use\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to let more people understand  how  the\r\n\r\nCARE   network  can  help.

Besides the periodic haze, we have  to  live\r\n\r\nwith  dark  clouds hovering over our region.  The  region\r\n\r\nhas  indeed  not recovered from the 1997 Asian  financial\r\n\r\ncrisis.  Close on its heels came the disaster of 9/11  in\r\n\r\n2001.   Prospects of a double-dip in the US  economy  and\r\n\r\nits  impact  on the region worry many of  us.   With  the\r\n\r\ndecline  in  direct  oil investments in  Southeast  Asia,\r\n\r\ncoupled   with   much  investments  being   diverted   or\r\n\r\nchannelled to China, ASEAN has indeed lost its shine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN seems to be in disarray in the post-Suharto\r\n\r\nera  and  appears unable to find new directions  and  new\r\n\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill  ASEAN  put its acts together and be a force  to  be\r\n\r\nreckoned   with?   The  rising  religious   fervour   and\r\n\r\npolitical extremism in some countries cast doubts on  the\r\n\r\nstability of the region and its ability to move  on  with\r\n\r\neconomic development.  The fallout from the October  2002\r\n\r\nbomb blast in Bali has worsened the economic prospects in\r\n\r\nthe  region by driving away tourists and shaking  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors' confidence in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, at the beginning of 2003, war may break out\r\n\r\nover  Iraq,  and North Korea is playing with  fire,  with\r\n\r\nPresident Kim embarking on brinkmanship.  This is  indeed\r\n\r\na  topsy-turvy world.  There seems to be no good news  or\r\n\r\ngood stories to tell of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are silver linings in the dark\r\n\r\nclouds.   I believe that the Southeast Asian nations  can\r\n\r\nemerge stronger economically and politically, if we focus\r\n\r\non  the problems and set our minds to deal with them.  We\r\n\r\ncan,   for   example,  leverage  on  the  Japan-Singapore\r\n\r\nEconomic Agreement for a New Age Partnership (JSEPA)  and\r\n\r\nthe  proposed China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement.   We  can\r\n\r\nsee that PRC, Japan and the United States of America, the\r\n\r\nthree  big  powers,  are  renewing  their  interests   in\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, there are signs that the US is\r\n\r\nbroadening  its  interest to encompass stronger  economic\r\n\r\nrelations  with Southeast Asia.  Singapore,  among  other\r\n\r\ncountries in the region, continues to have vital national\r\n\r\ninterests   and   supporting   long-term   US   strategic\r\n\r\nengagement  in  Asia  and  in  helping  to  prevent   the\r\n\r\nstabilising   strategic  competition  among   the   major\r\n\r\nregional powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year will be the year of big political changes\r\n\r\nin  the  region.   There will be elections  due  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries.   It  will  be  a  watershed  year.    Various\r\n\r\ngovernments   and   opposition   groups   in    Malaysia,\r\n\r\nPhilippines and Indonesia will be gearing up and shifting\r\n\r\ninto \"campaign mode\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of China is the most important long-term\r\n\r\ntrend in the region.  As China\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrows,  Taiwan remains the other potential flashpoint  in\r\n\r\nthe  Asia  Pacific.  The state of US-China relation  will\r\n\r\nalso be an important factor for regional stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, China is responding to increasing ASEAN\r\n\r\nconcerns that it is an economic challenge to the  region.\r\n\r\nTo  mitigate this fear, Beijing agreed on a framework for\r\n\r\nnegotiating  the  world's largest free  trade  agreement.\r\n\r\nAnd  after  several years of stalemate, China  and  ASEAN\r\n\r\nalso  agreed on a code of conduct on the South China Sea.\r\n\r\nIn  short, there are still some silver linings among  the\r\n\r\ndark clouds surrounding the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, therefore, I wish to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  is his reading of the prospects  for  the\r\n\r\nregion.   Are  we able to continue to have a  balance  of\r\n\r\npower  in  the region, with the big powers in place,  but\r\n\r\nnot  overwhelming  or  overbearing  in  influence?   What\r\n\r\npositive roles can Singapore play in the region,  despite\r\n\r\nour small size?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Madam, the impending\r\n\r\nwar in and on Iraq will have a tremendous effect all over\r\n\r\nthe world.  Many analysts have argued that the length  of\r\n\r\nthe  war  will determine the extent of its effects.   The\r\n\r\nIraqi  crisis  is  indeed a serious acid  test  to  world\r\n\r\npeace.   It  is  even challenging the  integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, in today's Today, Derrick Paulo analyses the\r\n\r\nlack of discourse on Iraq in Singapore.  Anecdotally,  we\r\n\r\nhave  heard many Singaporeans from all backgrounds,  they\r\n\r\nare concerned with the impending war.  Like many all over\r\n\r\nthe  world, I am sure we agree that war must be the  last\r\n\r\nresort.    The  issue  of  Iraq  provides  an   excellent\r\n\r\nopportunity for Singaporeans to understand the complexity\r\n\r\nof  international relations and Singapore's  position  in\r\n\r\nsuch  a  complex  world.  As a small country,  there  are\r\n\r\nfactors  that  have  to be taken into consideration  each\r\n\r\ntime  Singapore  is  challenged to  make  a  decision  on\r\n\r\ninternational  matters.  The Iraq issue  is  not  only  a\r\n\r\nchallenge to Singapore, but to the world over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I have two questions in relation to this\r\n\r\nissue.   One, I would like to ask the Minister  to  share\r\n\r\nwith  the  House  the principles that  guide  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndecision-making process in dealing with such complex  and\r\n\r\ncritical international issues.  Can he cite some previous\r\n\r\nexamples  on  decisions that Singapore has  made  on  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations based on such principles, especially  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  issues in the Middle East?  How is  Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing  viewed  by  the  world  community  based  on   the\r\n\r\nprinciples  we  hold and the decisions we  made  in  such\r\n\r\ninternational matters?  Next, since the war  in  Iraq  is\r\n\r\nimminent  and  should it take place, what are  the  plans\r\n\r\nthat  we have in being part of the United Nations' effort\r\n\r\nin rebuilding post-war Iraq?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, war clouds are looming\r\n\r\nover  Iraq.  There are rumours of war.  Singaporeans must\r\n\r\nbe  mentally  prepared  for the potential  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  fallout on our region in the event  of  war  in\r\n\r\nIraq.   If war breaks out, we can only hope that it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  short one.  Singaporeans must also brace ourselves\r\n\r\nof potential terrorist backlash in the region.  Recently,\r\n\r\nthere was a deadly bomb blast in Davao, Philippines.  The\r\n\r\nremnants of Al Qaeda and JI may seize the war in Iraq  to\r\n\r\ntarget against US and other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Singaporeans must not be swept\r\n\r\nalong  by the political and religious sentiment  about  a\r\n\r\npossible American attack against Iraq.  The drums of  war\r\n\r\nare beating.  But Singaporeans must keep a clear head and\r\n\r\na  brave  heart  and stand united.  We  must  respond  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We  must think and act according  to  our\r\n\r\nnational interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In difficult times, Singaporeans must have the\r\n\r\nopportunity to rally together as a nation, and  must  not\r\n\r\nbe swayed by events beyond our shores, over which we have\r\n\r\nno  control.  We must not be polarised by the war in Iraq\r\n\r\nor   by   the   terrorist  backlash.   After   all,   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, regardless of race, language and  religion,\r\n\r\nare in the same boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have enough challenges within.

What is Singapore's stand on this issue?   Some\r\n\r\nthink that Singapore is too pro-United States of America.\r\n\r\nIs  this  true?  I think not.  What is the likelihood  of\r\n\r\nthe  second  resolution being passed at the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil?   What  if  war broke out without  a  second  UN\r\n\r\nresolution?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, I think none of us here is\r\n\r\nnaive  enough  to  believe that  there  will  be  a  15-0\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  vote  in  favour  of  military  action\r\n\r\nagainst  Iraq.  Every day brings new revelations and  new\r\n\r\nalignments.   Singapore has said that it  hoped  that  US\r\n\r\nwould  act  according  to UN resolutions.   It  has  also\r\n\r\nsignalled to Iraq to comply with these resolutions.  Now,\r\n\r\nit  looks  like both sides are quite prepared  to  go  it\r\n\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand now, the US has made it clear that\r\n\r\nit  will  go  ahead with  its own battle against  Saddam,\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not the UN is with them.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nIraq continues its dangerous cat and mouse game with  the\r\n\r\narms  inspectors.  My question to the Minister  is  this:\r\n\r\nif  the  US  decides to strike out on its own, what  will\r\n\r\nSingapore's response be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have long been allies with the US. To speak\r\n\r\nagainst  any  unilateral action by the US  and  turn  our\r\n\r\nbacks would make us fair weather friends with the US.  At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, Singapore relies on the UN to secure  its\r\n\r\nposition  and  to ensure its survival as a nation  state.\r\n\r\nWe  have always advocated the need to comply with and  to\r\n\r\nact  in  accordance  with  the decisions  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.  If the US were to unilaterally act without  the\r\n\r\nsanction  of the UN Security Council, we would be  caught\r\n\r\nin a conundrum.  Should we break the rule and support the\r\n\r\nUS instead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, although the US has repeatedly\r\n\r\nsaid that it is fighting this war\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst terrorism, it has had to do a lot of work on home\r\n\r\nground  to  make  sure that it does  not  risk  a  Muslim\r\n\r\nuprising  in  its  own  country.   Singapore  is   in   a\r\n\r\npredominantly  Muslim  region.   To  stand  with  the  US\r\n\r\nagainst  the wishes of the UN Security Council  may  mean\r\n\r\nthat  we  run  the risk of alienating our neighbours,  no\r\n\r\nmatter how many clarifications we may make.  We also  run\r\n\r\nthe  risk  of  making ourselves unpopular  with  our  own\r\n\r\nMuslim   population,  if  we  do  not   manage   emotions\r\n\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this war starts, if it does, it can be\r\n\r\nshort and intense or long and bloody.  But whichever  way\r\n\r\nit  turns,  as leaders of a multi-religious  country,  we\r\n\r\nhave  our  work cut out for us.  Over the past  year,  we\r\n\r\nhave seen how fragile our national bonds are, against the\r\n\r\nprimordial  calls  of religion, faith  and  language.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister how else have we prepared\r\n\r\nour  people  now for whatever that lies ahead  of  us  in\r\n\r\nrelation to this Iraqi crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Despite all the flurry in\r\n\r\nthe  UN, it seems clear that US President George Bush has\r\n\r\ndecided  to  go to war against Iraq, with or  without  UN\r\n\r\nsanction, and that the war will be waged soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq is clearly seen by the Bush administration as a\r\n\r\npremier   source  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction   to\r\n\r\nterrorist groups in the future.  And although it poses no\r\n\r\nimminent threat to the US, the US is determined to disarm\r\n\r\nIraq  to  prevent it from becoming one.   What  does  our\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister make of the new doctrine of pre-emptive\r\n\r\nstrike - one which says that if you think a country  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  like you is going to attack you one day,  then\r\n\r\nyou have a legal and legitimate right to attack them now?\r\n\r\nIs  this a legal and legitimate right of the US?  If  so,\r\n\r\nthen  is  it not also legal for Saddam to launch  a  pre-emptive strike to pre-empt the US' pre-emptive strike, if\r\n\r\nit is able to do so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we all have contempt for Saddam Hussein; we\r\n\r\nabhor his brutality.

He  has\r\n\r\nrefused  to abide by the Security Council's demands  that\r\n\r\nhe  disarm.  The idea that ridding Saddam would  help  to\r\n\r\nnurture  a  more progressive Iraq that could spur  reform\r\n\r\nacross  the Arab-Muslim world is seductive.  But none  of\r\n\r\nus  relish the prospect of innocent lives being  lost  in\r\n\r\nthe war.  None of us will welcome the potential damage to\r\n\r\nMuslim opinion, especially in this region, or the blow to\r\n\r\nthe  international coalition against terrorism.  None  of\r\n\r\nus would like to be put in the position to have to choose\r\n\r\nbetween following the international community and the  UN\r\n\r\non  the  one hand, or the US on the other.  There can  be\r\n\r\nserious  consequences if the war were to go ahead without\r\n\r\nUN  sanction: instability across the Middle East, an  end\r\n\r\nto  hope  for  the Palestinians, a boost  for  terrorism,\r\n\r\nEurope  divided,  an  outraged  Southeast  Asia,  and   a\r\n\r\nweakened UN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, our stand on this critical issue would have\r\n\r\nto  be  based on principle and on our national  interest,\r\n\r\nand  not  on  mere expediency or on who our friends  are.\r\n\r\nThe  challenge  to us lies in summoning the  intellectual\r\n\r\nstrength  to  think  independently for ourselves,  rather\r\n\r\nthan   accepting   wholesale,   without   question,   the\r\n\r\nconclusions   and   precepts   presented   and   packaged\r\n\r\nelsewhere.

War can be averted\r\n\r\nif   Iraq  immediately  and  unequivocally  declares  its\r\n\r\ncompliance of UN Resolution 1441 and implements action to\r\n\r\ndestroy  its  arsenal  of weapons  of  mass  destruction,\r\n\r\nincluding biological and chemical weapons.  UN inspectors\r\n\r\ncan  then be given adequate time to check and verify that\r\n\r\nIraq acts in accordance with its declaration, subject  to\r\n\r\nthe satisfaction of the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War should only be fought as a last resort. My\r\n\r\ncolleagues have mentioned this.  We should be given  time\r\n\r\nand  opportunity  to  exhaust  every  avenue  to  achieve\r\n\r\npeaceful  disarmament.  However,  sometimes  we  must  be\r\n\r\nready  to go to war to win peace and stability.  If  Iraq\r\n\r\ncontinues to wilfully ignore UN resolutions after  having\r\n\r\nmore   than   adequate  time  to  consider  the   serious\r\n\r\nimplications  of  its  decision, then  war  is  the  only\r\n\r\neffective  solution left.  But it is better that  war  be\r\n\r\npursued with full UN backing.  We want the United Nations\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  to  be  united.   A  divided  UN  will\r\n\r\nthreaten international law and order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, what would be the position if the impasse\r\n\r\ncontinues  in  the  UN Security Council  and  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  declares  war unilaterally without  UN  sanction?\r\n\r\nThe  UN  Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has  warned  that\r\n\r\nsuch  a  war  will  be short on legitimacy  and  it  will\r\n\r\n\"violate  the world body's charter\".  There can  also  be\r\n\r\nother  consequences.  A war without UN backing can create\r\n\r\nmore  problems  for peace in the Middle East.   It  could\r\n\r\nalso  complicate the war against terrorism.  Worse still,\r\n\r\nit could lead to increased threats of terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, how can we best safeguard\r\n\r\nSingapore's interests?

If China succeeds  in\r\n\r\nrestraining  North  Korea - and we certainly  hope  China\r\n\r\nwould  -  its  already  growing political,  economic  and\r\n\r\nstrategic weight will be further enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, an aerial incident resulted when North\r\n\r\nKorean  fighter planes confronted a US spy plane  in  the\r\n\r\nSea  of  Japan.

Any  miscalculation  might  well   lead   to\r\n\r\nescalation  and  into conflict in the  Korean  peninsula,\r\n\r\nwhere  tensions  are  already  high  over  North  Korea's\r\n\r\ndecision to reactivate its nuclear reactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if war were to break out in the Korean\r\n\r\npeninsula,   it   will  destabilise  the   region,   both\r\n\r\neconomically   and  geo-politically.

I  would like to agree with  him  by  saying\r\n\r\nthat, yes, indeed there has been much bad news.  I cannot\r\n\r\nrecall any other period in recent history when we have to\r\n\r\noperate  in  such  a fluid, unpredictable  and  turbulent\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I will do is to give an overview of how I see\r\n\r\nour  position in the region, how Singapore is positioning\r\n\r\nitself with regard to our neighbours and the major powers\r\n\r\nand  then  point  out  how we see the  overall  strategic\r\n\r\nlandscape  in  which  we have to operate.   Members  have\r\n\r\nspoken about national interests.  I will state how we see\r\n\r\nour  national interests which guide our policies on  many\r\n\r\nforeign  policy issues, including that of Iraq.   Then  I\r\n\r\nwill  respond to the specific questions on Iraq and North\r\n\r\nKorea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, our relations with our ASEAN neighbours\r\n\r\nremain  a  key  focus  of our foreign  policy.   On  25th\r\n\r\nJanuary  2003, I had already spoken at length  about  our\r\n\r\nrelations with Malaysia.  Admittedly, they are not in the\r\n\r\nbest  state.   But  both  sides  have  brought  down  the\r\n\r\ntemperature.   Our relations with other  Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\ncountries are excellent and strengthening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Indonesia, our ties are deep and broad. To\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  Singapore's confidence in  Indonesia,  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  visited Jakarta last  December,  just  two\r\n\r\nmonths after the Bali bombings.  He was the first foreign\r\n\r\nleader  to  do  so.  It was a gesture of  our  consistent\r\n\r\nsupport for President Megawati and her government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh also visited Thailand and Vietnam\r\n\r\nearlier  this year.  Many new initiatives were undertaken\r\n\r\nduring these visits.  President Nathan's state visits\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  Cambodia and Vietnam also underscored our  close  and\r\n\r\nwarm  ties  with those neighbours.  We will  continue  to\r\n\r\nmake  efforts to improve relations with Malaysia and,  at\r\n\r\nthe same time, consolidate our excellent ties with others\r\n\r\nin ASEAN and the rest of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our relations with other countries,\r\n\r\nbeyond  ASEAN, we have strong and healthy relations  with\r\n\r\nall  the  major  powers.   With  the  United  States,  we\r\n\r\nconcluded  a FTA which is now before Congress.   The  US-Singapore FTA is not just important for economic  growth,\r\n\r\nit  also  has importance strategically.  It will  add  an\r\n\r\nimportant  new dimension to our already strong  economic,\r\n\r\nmilitary and political ties with the United States.   And\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister will visit Washington later this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With China, we continue to have excellent relations,\r\n\r\nand  we  have  frequent exchanges  of  visits  by  senior\r\n\r\nleaders  on  both  sides.  President  Hu  Jintao  visited\r\n\r\nSingapore  last year before assuming the top  post.   The\r\n\r\nnew  Chinese  leadership is familiar to  us.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  intends to visit China in the  course  of  this\r\n\r\nyear.   As  China  grows, our relationship  with  it,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  will  assume  even greater  importance,  and  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that China will become an even more  significant\r\n\r\npart  of  the  regional equation.  Our strong  ties  with\r\n\r\nBeijing are therefore, in my view, a plus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Japan, our relationship has been brought to a\r\n\r\nnew  height  with  the conclusion of the  Japan-Singapore\r\n\r\nEconomic Agreement for a New Age Partnership (JSEPA).   I\r\n\r\nvisited   Japan   last  year  and  held   very   fruitful\r\n\r\ndiscussions   with  Japanese  Foreign   Minister   Yoriko\r\n\r\nKawaguchi on matters of mutual concern.  I am glad to say\r\n\r\nthat  Prime Minister Goh will visit Japan in a few weeks'\r\n\r\ntime.   Japan  is  struggling to shake a decade  of  slow\r\n\r\ngrowth.   But  for all its problems, Japan is  still  the\r\n\r\nsecond  largest economy in the world and of  considerable\r\n\r\nimportance  to Singapore and the region.   We  will  work\r\n\r\nclosely with Tokyo to enhance our bilateral relations, as\r\n\r\nwell  as  facilitate Japan's role in  ASEAN.   This  year\r\n\r\nmarks the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30th  Anniversary  of  the  commencement  of  Japan-ASEAN\r\n\r\nrelations.

Our traditional ties with India are strong and  we\r\n\r\nare   adding   to  them  in  many  ways,  including   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  negotiating  a  Comprehensive   Economic\r\n\r\nCooperation Agreement (CECA) with India.  We  share  many\r\n\r\ncommon  strategic interests and our economic relationship\r\n\r\nhas  assumed  greater importance. We have  also  strongly\r\n\r\nsupported  the  convening  of  the  ASEAN-India  Leaders'\r\n\r\nSummit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ties with the European countries are also strong\r\n\r\nand  healthy.

New Zealand is a strong and reliable  friend\r\n\r\nand was our first FTA partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a very truncated account of our relations\r\n\r\nwith  countries in the region and the major powers.  What\r\n\r\nI  want to stress is this:  that our relations with these\r\n\r\ncountries  and the stability of our region and the  state\r\n\r\nof  health  of the region do not occur in a  vacuum.   We\r\n\r\nmust  view  them  in  the broader strategic  context  and\r\n\r\nglobal  developments.  Let me briefly explain the complex\r\n\r\nglobal environment which we are currently operating in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cold War has ended. But a decade after the end\r\n\r\nof  the  Cold  War,  it has become very  clear  that  the\r\n\r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the dangerous\r\n\r\nnuclear confrontation between the superpowers really have\r\n\r\nnot  made  for a more peaceful world. Yes, we  no  longer\r\n\r\nhave  the  eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation  between  the\r\n\r\nworld's  super  powers.  But we live now in  a  new  era,\r\n\r\nwhich sees us facing many different challenges, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnew threats to our physical security, economic well-being\r\n\r\nand social stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The post-Cold War world has proved to be a messy and\r\n\r\ndangerous  place.  Just to name a few major developments,\r\n\r\nthe  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf  War  to\r\n\r\nrestore  Kuwaiti independence; the collapse of  countries\r\n\r\nresulting in political and humanitarian crisis such as in\r\n\r\nSomalia   and  Haiti;  genocidal  violence   in   Rwanda;\r\n\r\npolitical  turmoil,  \"ethnic cleansing\"  and  ultimately,\r\n\r\nNATO  interventions in the Balkans.  The Middle East  was\r\n\r\nand continues to be wrecked by endemic violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if that was the state of affairs after the end\r\n\r\nof  the Cold War, post 9/11, the world has become an even\r\n\r\nmessier  and  more  dangerous place.  9/11  revealed  the\r\n\r\nexistence   of   highly   organised   and   well-financed\r\n\r\ntransnational  terrorist organisations of  global  scope,\r\n\r\nmotivated  by  a  radical and deviant  interpretation  of\r\n\r\nIslam,  determined  to  bring down secular  and  moderate\r\n\r\ngovernments. These governments were predominately  Muslim\r\n\r\ncountries - Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Sudan,  Somalia,\r\n\r\nNigeria,  Pakistan, Malaysia and Indonesia.  Even  we  in\r\n\r\nSingapore were not spared as the JI arrests have shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle against terrorism is clearly not a\r\n\r\nstruggle  against  Islam.  But it is an unfortunate  fact\r\n\r\nthat  it is complicated by the campaign of the terrorists\r\n\r\nto  portray it as a war against Islam. They have targeted\r\n\r\nthe  United States and its friends because the US is  the\r\n\r\nchief   obstacle  to  their  designs.  The  war   against\r\n\r\nterrorism  has  also been complicated by  the  discomfort\r\n\r\nwhich  many  Muslims - and not just Muslims - have  about\r\n\r\nUnited States' policies in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no one can be a bystander in this struggle.\r\n\r\nAnd  terrorism will exist even if there is a solution  to\r\n\r\nthe  Middle  East  problem.   Pretending  to  ignore  the\r\n\r\nproblems will not buy greater safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post 9/11, all countries, including Singapore, have\r\n\r\nhad to reassess the secu-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrity  priorities and strategic interests.  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen  compelled  to  do  so  because  Iraq's  decade-long\r\n\r\nflouting  of UN efforts to disarm it of weapons  of  mass\r\n\r\ndestruction    (WMD)   has   assumed   more   threatening\r\n\r\nproportions.   It  now  poses  an  unacceptable  risk  of\r\n\r\nproliferation.   As Members will know,  North  Korea  has\r\n\r\ntaken advantage of the Iraqi crisis to push forward  with\r\n\r\nits  own  nuclear  weapons  programme,  creating  a  very\r\n\r\ndangerous situation in North Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, one paradoxical aspect of 9/11 has been\r\n\r\nto  stabilise  major power relations in the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nmaking   for   a   more   favourable  overall   strategic\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I refer to relations between China\r\n\r\nand  the  US which have become more stable.  The US-China\r\n\r\nrelationship  is  a  key bilateral relationship  in  East\r\n\r\nAsia.  If  that relationship is stable, it has a  calming\r\n\r\neffect in the entire region.  But when China-US relations\r\n\r\nbecome roiled, the entire region becomes unsettled.  Good\r\n\r\nChina-US  relations therefore are important for a  stable\r\n\r\nstrategic environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, which Dr Ong Chit Chung asked,\r\n\r\nI   would   say  that  another  interesting   post   9/11\r\n\r\ndevelopment  is that China, Japan and the  United  States\r\n\r\nare  renewing their interests in South-east Asia.  So are\r\n\r\nIndia  and Europe. Post 9/11, the major powers have  also\r\n\r\nrediscovered ASEAN's importance in maintaining  stability\r\n\r\nin  our  region  and  that  we  are  assuming  a  greater\r\n\r\nprominence  in  the global anti-terrorism campaign.   The\r\n\r\nmajor  powers are now engaging ASEAN, I would  say,  with\r\n\r\ngreater  enthusiasm, than I have seen a  few  years  ago.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  plus for Singapore; and is a  plus  for  the\r\n\r\nregion as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism and these new challenges require national,\r\n\r\nregional   and  international  responses.  We   have   to\r\n\r\nstructure  our responses within the international  system\r\n\r\nthat is no longer bipolar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I would say that the key geo-political effect of\r\n\r\nthe post-Cold War is a pre-eminence of the United States;\r\n\r\na pre-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neminence on the scale unprecedented in history and multi-dimensional in its scope; not just military but economic,\r\n\r\nfinancial and technological.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not likely that American pre-eminence can be\r\n\r\nseriously  challenged by any country  or  combination  of\r\n\r\ncountries in the foreseeable future.  Like it or not,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  geo-political reality that no international  issue\r\n\r\ntoday can be resolved without the active cooperation,  or\r\n\r\nat least acquiescence, of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the United States is at the forefront of the war\r\n\r\nagainst  terrorism, proliferation, and security challenge\r\n\r\npresented by Iraq and North Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sheer scale of United States' pre-eminence has,\r\n\r\nof course, provoked a degree of international discomfort,\r\n\r\neven  among  United States' close friends and  allies  in\r\n\r\nEurope,  South Korea and Japan. That discomfort  is  seen\r\n\r\nnow being focused on the Iraq issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are Singapore's national interests? We have to\r\n\r\nask this question because in the midst of these confusing\r\n\r\nand  troubling  times, in the midst of  an  international\r\n\r\ndebate  in which seemingly valid points are made  by  all\r\n\r\nsides, I think it is important, as several of the Members\r\n\r\nhave pointed out, that we in Singapore understand what is\r\n\r\nSingapore's  national  interests.   And  I   agree   with\r\n\r\nMembers, Dr Ong Chit Chung and Dr Maliki, that it is  all\r\n\r\nthe  more  important  now for us  not  to  be  swayed  by\r\n\r\nemotions  or the fashion of the moment, but to  carefully\r\n\r\nand  calmly  assess our national interests with  a  clear\r\n\r\nhead.  Let me set out some basic considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, yes, of course, the world may well be\r\n\r\nbetter   off   with   a   more  balanced   structure   of\r\n\r\ninternational power.  There is no doubt about that.  But,\r\n\r\nour  wishing it to be so is not going to make it  happen.\r\n\r\nWould  we be better off if the Cold War was still on  or,\r\n\r\nworse  still, if the Soviet Union had emerged triumphant?\r\n\r\nI do not think so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singapore has for many years emphasised\r\n\r\nthe importance of the United\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStates   in   providing  stability  and   that   is   the\r\n\r\nirreplaceable  foundation for Asia-Pacific  growth  since\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the Second World War.  We have stated  that\r\n\r\nposition  of  ours  even at the  time  when  it  was  not\r\n\r\nfashionable  or  politically  correct  to  do  so.   Why?\r\n\r\nBecause   it  was  in  Singapore's  fundamental  national\r\n\r\ninterests.   A small country like Singapore  can  survive\r\n\r\nand prosper only when there is a stable balance of power.\r\n\r\nAnd  the  United States is an irreplaceable part  of  any\r\n\r\nregional  or international balance.  And it is  not  just\r\n\r\nstatements  that we have made to that effect but,  within\r\n\r\nour  limited means, we have done what we could to provide\r\n\r\naccess  to our facilities to enable the United States  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  its presence in our region.  And we  did  that,\r\n\r\nagain, because it was in our national interest to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, terrorism is a threat to Singapore as it is\r\n\r\nto  all civilised countries. The proliferation of weapons\r\n\r\nof  mass  destruction is a particular threat to  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  like  Singapore  where  a  single  chemical   or\r\n\r\nbiological attack will have a catastrophic effect  on  an\r\n\r\nentire  nation.   A nuclear attack would  also  mean  the\r\n\r\nphysical  end  of Singapore.  And this is  not  something\r\n\r\ntheoretical  or  far-fetched -  only  two  days  ago,  Mr\r\n\r\nMohamad El Baradei said on BBC addressing a conference of\r\n\r\nthe  IAEA  where  he warned of the reports  of  terrorist\r\n\r\nplans   to   build  and  deploy  radiological  dispersion\r\n\r\ndevices,  and he said, given the inadequacies  of  source\r\n\r\ncontrol,  it  is clear that additional security  measures\r\n\r\nare  urgently needed.  So if action is not taken  against\r\n\r\nIraq  or  other countries who possess illegal weapons  of\r\n\r\nmass   destruction,   what  will  be   the   implications\r\n\r\ninternationally?  This is a question that  everyone  must\r\n\r\nask  in  Singapore.  Supposing, after all that  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid  and  done,  in the end, Iraq is not disarmed,  what\r\n\r\nsignal  would  this send to extremist groups  across  the\r\n\r\nworld?  After all, after 9/11, in other words, the  issue\r\n\r\nof weapons of mass destruction proliferation has taken on\r\n\r\nan entirely new and even more threatening dimension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Korea has already taken advantage of the\r\n\r\ninternational pre-occupation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith  Iraq  to push forward with its own nuclear  weapons\r\n\r\nprogramme. Singapore has expressed its deep concern  over\r\n\r\nNorth  Korea's  actions and called upon it to  reconsider\r\n\r\nits actions.  I will come back when I answer the specific\r\n\r\nquestions later on on North Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure Members that Singapore will not flinch\r\n\r\nfrom  doing  what  is necessary to advance  our  national\r\n\r\ninterests.   But we will assess each situation  carefully\r\n\r\nin  the  light  of our own interest, make  our  decisions\r\n\r\nbased  on the facts and our calculations of the long-term\r\n\r\nnational  interest  and good of Singapore.  We  will  not\r\n\r\nhesitate  to  state  our  own views,  even  if  it  means\r\n\r\ndisagreeing  with  other countries, whether  they  are  a\r\n\r\nmajor power or not.  And indeed, we have had occasions to\r\n\r\ndo  so.   But  it is in Singapore's overall  interest  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  best possible relations we can,  not  just\r\n\r\nwith the US, but with all the major powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, I hope, will trust that the Government will\r\n\r\nalways  adopt  a foreign policy based on the  fundamental\r\n\r\nprinciples which I had just elaborated.  We have earned a\r\n\r\nreputation  internationally  as  a  principled  and  fair\r\n\r\ncountry.  That reputation was reaffirmed during our  term\r\n\r\nas a Security Council member in the last two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having made those comments on the strategic overview\r\n\r\nand    having   stated   the   key   national   interests\r\n\r\nconsiderations,  let me now respond to Members  who  have\r\n\r\nasked about our position in Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of our position, which has been stated\r\n\r\npublicly on many occasions can be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the onus is on Iraq to disarm and it is\r\n\r\nimperative that Iraq disarms immediately and comply  with\r\n\r\nall United Nations Security Council Resolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have insisted on this because of the need\r\n\r\nfor all UN members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  scrupulously  comply with UN  Resolutions,  and  also\r\n\r\nbecause  of the grave threat to international  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity caused by the development and spread of  weapons\r\n\r\nof mass destruction (WMD).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that this is not a new position. Our\r\n\r\nposition predates the present diplomatic standoff in  the\r\n\r\nUN.  It is a position we have consistently articulated in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Nations.  In fact, our position  dates  back\r\n\r\nmany   years  to  the  Gulf  War,  when  we  joined   the\r\n\r\ninternational   community  then  in   condemning   Iraq's\r\n\r\naggression  against Kuwait as totally unacceptable  under\r\n\r\ninternational law and the United Nations Charter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put matters in context, the current crisis\r\n\r\nactually  stems  from some important  outstanding  issues\r\n\r\nsince  the  end  of  the Gulf War.  And  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to put matters in context, because we often get\r\n\r\nthe  wrong  picture when there is talk about  a  \"second\"\r\n\r\nResolution  of  the  Security  Council.   In  fact   this\r\n\r\nresolution  would  have been the  18th  of  the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  on Iraq's non-compliance, and the most  critical\r\n\r\nof  these outstanding issues is the disarmament of Iraq's\r\n\r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That critical aspect was central to the post-Gulf\r\n\r\nWar  ceasefire  settlement reached between the  coalition\r\n\r\nforces and Iraq, and is set out in UNSC Resolution 687 of\r\n\r\nApril  1991.  In other words, to put matters in  context,\r\n\r\nwe have to go back to 1991.  In the Security Council last\r\n\r\nyear  (October  2002),  when we  were  a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, we made a statement and we said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Regrettably, Iraq has not complied with many of the\r\n\r\nterms  of  Resolution 687, even though  eleven  and  half\r\n\r\nyears have passed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is not just Resolution 1441 that\r\n\r\nwe  are  talking about.  Iraq has had a deplorable record\r\n\r\nof  complying with UNSC Resolutions.  Next, I want to say\r\n\r\nthat  the  United  Nations Security  Council  unanimously\r\n\r\ndecided  last  year in November 2002 on  Resolution  1441\r\n\r\nthat \"Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its\r\n\r\nobligations   under   relevant   resolutions,   including\r\n\r\nResolution 687\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1991).\"  and  decided \"to give a final  opportunity\"  to\r\n\r\nIraq  to  comply and Iraq was warned that \"it  will  face\r\n\r\nserious   consequences  as  a  result  of  its  continued\r\n\r\nviolations of its obligations\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned just now, we have to take a strong\r\n\r\nstand on the threat posed by WMD, particularly after 9/11\r\n\r\nbecause  the  danger of WMD falling  into  the  hands  of\r\n\r\nterrorists, terrorist organisations or extremist  groups,\r\n\r\nas  I  said,  is not a hypothetical risk.   In  fact,  as\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have  read on this  subject  know,   Saddam\r\n\r\nHussein  actually  used biological and  chemical  weapons\r\n\r\nagainst his own people and the people of Iran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current intense diplomatic efforts show that the\r\n\r\nIraq  issue is a very complex one which necessitates  the\r\n\r\nbalancing   of  several  different  considerations   and,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, not all of them fit neatly together.   The\r\n\r\nUnited  States is facing a difficult time in the Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.   There have been global anti-war protests.   No\r\n\r\none  in  this Chamber or outside this Chamber likes  war.\r\n\r\nBut  let us be clear about the facts and the equities  of\r\n\r\nthe  case.  And if you look at the facts of the case,  it\r\n\r\nis  very clear to us that it is Iraq, not the US and  not\r\n\r\nthe  UN, not the international community, which is in the\r\n\r\ndock.   The onus is on Iraq and if the consequences ensue\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is a use of force, it must  be  because  of\r\n\r\nIraq's failure to comply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like many other countries, Singapore also favours\r\n\r\nthat  there  be a second United Nations Security  Council\r\n\r\nresolution.   And we have called for a UN resolution;  we\r\n\r\nhave  advocated the Council's unity, a point made  by  Mr\r\n\r\nOthman  Haron.   I  do  not  want  to  speculate  on  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood  of  a  second resolution  being  passed.   As\r\n\r\nsomebody mentioned just now, things are changing  day  by\r\n\r\nday, hour to hour and your guess is as good as mine.  The\r\n\r\nSecurity Council members, according to the latest  e-mail\r\n\r\nI  received  from  our  Ambassador, are  still  intensely\r\n\r\ndeliberating over the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what I would like to say here in response\r\n\r\nto Mr Sin Boon Ann is that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  if  there  is  no second resolution,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nautomatically  follow that action against Iraq  is  taken\r\n\r\noutside  international  law or  United  Nations  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil   authorisation.   The  United  Nations  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  Resolution 1441 has clearly pronounced that Iraq\r\n\r\nhas   been   in  material  breach  of  Security   Council\r\n\r\nresolutions for more than 12 years; from UNSC  Resolution\r\n\r\n678  of  1990  right  up to Resolution  1441  last  year.\r\n\r\nSingapore has said so at the UN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effects of the war? Of course, any war in Iraq,\r\n\r\nwith  or  without a second UNSC Resolution, will  have  a\r\n\r\nnegative impact on the world and in our region.  It  will\r\n\r\nresult in loss of lives; it will result in destruction of\r\n\r\nproperties;  it  will affect investment  sentiments,  may\r\n\r\npush up oil prices; and will leave a deep scar surely  on\r\n\r\nthose directly involved in the war for a long time.   And\r\n\r\nI  think  it  will  also be exploited by  extremists  and\r\n\r\nterrorists  for  their own purposes.   We  must  have  no\r\n\r\nillusions on the effects of such a war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, Singapore has taken a consistent position\r\n\r\non  Iraq since Resolution 678 in 1990 and Resolution  687\r\n\r\nin  1991.  Our  understanding of United Nations  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil  Resolution 1441, which was adopted by  consensus\r\n\r\nwhen  we were in the Security Council, was that it  found\r\n\r\nIraq   in   material   breach  of  UN  Security   Council\r\n\r\nresolutions.  It was intended as a final chance for  Iraq\r\n\r\nand  would  have  serious consequences if  Iraq  did  not\r\n\r\ncomply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraq's possession of illegal WMD is, post 9/11, an\r\n\r\nunacceptable threat. If Iraq gets away without disarming,\r\n\r\nit will send a very bad signal to extremist groups across\r\n\r\nthe  world.   The  fact that the Security Council  cannot\r\n\r\nreach consensus on a second resolution cannot be taken as\r\n\r\nan excuse for inaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, our key consideration must be\r\n\r\nour national interest.  The UN can only operate within  a\r\n\r\nstable  international environment and it is  that  stable\r\n\r\nenvironment that Iraq's WMD threatens.  Hence, it  is  in\r\n\r\nour  fundamental national interest to see Iraq  disarmed.\r\n\r\nThis is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  send  the right signal to  extremists  and\r\n\r\nother  states like North Korea that are trying to develop\r\n\r\nWMD,  as  well  as to signal to non-state  players,  like\r\n\r\nterrorists and extremist groups whose threat to the world\r\n\r\nwill be enhanced if they get their hands on WMD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked whether our stand on Iraq\r\n\r\nmakes  us  too pro-United States.  Some Members  told  me\r\n\r\nthis  point  has  also arisen in their dialogue  sessions\r\n\r\nwith  their constituents.  Perhaps I should address  this\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not pro-US; we are not anti-any country.\r\n\r\nWhat then are we?  We are being pro-Singapore.  By that I\r\n\r\nmean  that  when we take positions, we do so  to  advance\r\n\r\nSingapore's   national  interests.   Yes,   we   strongly\r\n\r\nadvocated   United   States'   continued   presence   and\r\n\r\nengagement  in  this  region.   Yes,  we  have  excellent\r\n\r\nbilateral  relations with the United  States.   But  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean  that we are subservient  to  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  or that we agree with everything that the  United\r\n\r\nStates does, or says, or requests, without regard to  our\r\n\r\nown national interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those older colleagues of mine in this House need\r\n\r\nnot  be  reminded  in  this regard  of  the  Michael  Fay\r\n\r\nincident, where on a matter concerning law and order,  we\r\n\r\nstood  for our right to enforce our laws despite  immense\r\n\r\npressure  from  the  US.   There  have  been  many  other\r\n\r\ninstances  over  the  years  where  our  positions   have\r\n\r\ndiffered  from the United States, and where we could  not\r\n\r\ngo along with their requests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give one example and this might also\r\n\r\nanswer  Dr  Maliki's  question  on  whether  I  can  give\r\n\r\nexamples where our positions are based on principles, how\r\n\r\nwe  are viewed and so on.  And the example I will take is\r\n\r\nthe  Palestinian issue which was, and is, still  a  very,\r\n\r\nvery heated and sensitive issue in the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Palestinian issue, we have supported action\r\n\r\nand decisions that could advance the prospects for peace,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe   have  tried  to  play  a  moderating  role  wherever\r\n\r\npossible.   In  March 2001, the United  States  vetoed  a\r\n\r\nUnited  Nations  Security Council resolution  that  would\r\n\r\ncall  for an international observer force to be  sent  to\r\n\r\nhelp   restore   peace   in  the   Palestinian   Occupied\r\n\r\nTerritories.   However, although the  United  States  was\r\n\r\nopposed to this and urged us not to support it, Singapore\r\n\r\nco-sponsored and voted for that draft resolution, because\r\n\r\nwe  felt  that  the  proposal to send  an  impartial  and\r\n\r\nneutral  international presence had merits and  had  wide\r\n\r\nsupport  in the UN as one way to stabilise the  situation\r\n\r\nin  the  occupied territories.  And in the first half  of\r\n\r\n2002  when we were in the Security Council, we were  also\r\n\r\nclosely involved in several initiatives to get Israel  to\r\n\r\ncomply   with  Security  Council   resolutions   and   we\r\n\r\nsupported  calls  for  an  immediate  ceasefire  and  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  Israeli  forces  from  West  Bank  towns,\r\n\r\nincluding Ramallah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our voting records in the UN on the\r\n\r\nPalestinian  issue  are very different  from  the  United\r\n\r\nStates.    Records  published  and  circulated   by   the\r\n\r\nPalestinian  Authority show that Singapore has  voted  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of all the key 17 United Nations resolutions  on\r\n\r\nthe  Palestinian issue.  On this issue also, we  are  not\r\n\r\npro  or  anti  any side; we have maintained a  principled\r\n\r\nstand; we have maintained a constructive stand.  We  have\r\n\r\nsaid that the countries in the region must recognise  the\r\n\r\nright of Israel to exist within secure borders, and  that\r\n\r\nwe  have also said that we must also recognise the  right\r\n\r\nof the Palestinian people to a homeland of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, a quick response on North Korea. I\r\n\r\nsaid  \"quick\" because our position on WMD,  the  risk  of\r\n\r\nproliferation and the linkage with terrorism, also shaped\r\n\r\nour  position  on North Korea. And we are concerned  also\r\n\r\nfor what it portends for the stability of North East Asia\r\n\r\nand  for  Asia.  Therefore, we expressed our concerns  on\r\n\r\nNorth   Korea's  decision  to  reactivate   its   nuclear\r\n\r\nprogramme,  to  cease cooperation with the  IAEA  and  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  from  NPT.   We have said publicly  that  North\r\n\r\nKorea's  decision has grave repercussions on  the  Korean\r\n\r\nPeninsula and for the international\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-proliferation regime.  We have issued  statements  to\r\n\r\nexpress  our  concerns.  We have  urged  North  Korea  to\r\n\r\nreconsider  its decision.  It is a retrograde steps  that\r\n\r\nundermines    KEDO    (Korean    Peninsula    Development\r\n\r\nOrganisation)   and  raises  tensions   on   the   Korean\r\n\r\nPeninsula, which complicates the Asia Pacific's  security\r\n\r\nsituation as a whole.  North Korea's recent missile tests\r\n\r\nhave further aggravated the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is not in the interest of Singapore and other\r\n\r\ncountries  to  see tensions on the Korean Peninsula.   If\r\n\r\nthe   current   tensions  escalate  further,   it   could\r\n\r\ndestabilise  the  strategic balance in  the  Asia-Pacific\r\n\r\nregion,  and possibly trigger a regional arms  race.   We\r\n\r\nhave  encouraged all interested parties, including United\r\n\r\nStates,  South Korea and Japan, China, Russia  and  North\r\n\r\nKorea  to  continue their dialogue in  order  to  restore\r\n\r\nstability in the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One quick clarification, Mr Sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Will the Minister please clarify\r\n\r\nwhether  the past resolutions of the UN Security  Council\r\n\r\non  Iraq  specifically allow the US  to  take  unilateral\r\n\r\naction  in the event of non-compliance by Iraq  on  these\r\n\r\nresolutions?  Secondly, as a matter of international law,\r\n\r\nwould  it  be  right for the US to take  such  unilateral\r\n\r\naction without the specific sanction of the UN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Madam, if the Member is\r\n\r\ninterested,  I could send him a copy of Resolution  1441.\r\n\r\nBut,  as I said, it is not just Resolution 1441.

Somebody mentioned  Kofi  Annan,  UN\r\n\r\nSecretary-General.   Singapore and I have  great  respect\r\n\r\nfor him.  But I think these issues will be debated for  a\r\n\r\nvery  long time and the key point I want to emphasise  is\r\n\r\nthat,  while this debate goes on, the issue is:  if there\r\n\r\nis  a paralysis in the decision-making of the UN Security\r\n\r\nCouncil,  its  international order,  other  interests  of\r\n\r\npeace-loving  countries  who  are  concerned   with   WMD\r\n\r\nterrorists, are these served by inaction as a result of a\r\n\r\nparalysis,  or  they  are served by  ensuring  that  Iraq\r\n\r\ndisarms?  That is the dilemma.  So, we can have this fine\r\n\r\ninternational  debate,  I would have  to  meet  with  the\r\n\r\ninternational lawyers in the Attorney-General's  Chambers\r\n\r\n...it can go on.  This debate has already begun.  You have\r\n\r\nread  both  sides of it but I would say that an  argument\r\n\r\nhas also been made - a very strong argument has also been\r\n\r\nmade  - that the legal basis for any military action  may\r\n\r\nbe  drawn  from  the  framework of all  the  UN  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil's  resolutions.  As I have  said,  while  we  can\r\n\r\nsplit  fine legal hairs, the key policy dilemma, the  key\r\n\r\nlaw and order dilemma for the world and for us is, if war\r\n\r\nbreaks  out,  who has been responsible for  it?   In  our\r\n\r\nview,  it  is  because of the failure of Iraq  to  disarm\r\n\r\npromptly and effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, ASEAN was established\r\n\r\nwith  goodwill  and had many good years of  unprecedented\r\n\r\neconomic   growth.   There  was  internal  cohesion   and\r\n\r\ncollective strength.  However, with the exit of President\r\n\r\nSuharto  and the Asian economic crisis, many  think  that\r\n\r\nASEAN  has  lost  its  direction and momentum.   Internal\r\n\r\ndissension  and  rivalry  have  surfaced.   One   wonders\r\n\r\nwhether  some  ASEAN states can settle their  differences\r\n\r\nand  come  to  terms  with  each  other.   There  is  now\r\n\r\ntiredness  about  ASEAN.  Attention  and  direct  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments have now shifted to China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the Minister is: has ASEAN expanded\r\n\r\ntoo  fast and too soon in terms of membership?  Has ASEAN\r\n\r\neaten  more than it can chew or digest?  I would like  to\r\n\r\nask the Minister what role\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  ASEAN  play  in  the future and  whether  there  are\r\n\r\nmeasures to strengthen ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, can we upgrade or strengthen the ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum so that it will not merely be a talk  shop\r\n\r\nbut   also   a  platform  for  confidence  building   and\r\n\r\npreventive diplomacy?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Madam, there was a time when ASEAN\r\n\r\nwas  a  regional  grouping much envied by  many  for  its\r\n\r\nability  to  demonstrate its cohesiveness  and  unity  in\r\n\r\ncollectively  dealing with the world.  Its success  as  a\r\n\r\npolitical organisation even inspired many to suggest that\r\n\r\nASEAN should move to the next level to become an economic\r\n\r\nunion  to  tap  on its huge market potential  of  half  a\r\n\r\nbillion people.  Many had held the hope that ASEAN  could\r\n\r\nrival China as the next economic powerhouse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sixties and the seventies, ASEAN was seen\r\n\r\nas  a  bastion  of  Southeast Asia's  stand  against  the\r\n\r\nonslaught  of  communism, both  within  and  outside  the\r\n\r\nregion.  As a consequence of the perceived common threat,\r\n\r\nthe  then  members of ASEAN were able to rally  together,\r\n\r\ndespite   real   differences.   This  successful   coming\r\n\r\ntogether  to  deal with common problems, particularly  in\r\n\r\ninternational forums like the United Nations, served as a\r\n\r\nbasis  for  Southeast  Asian nations  to  come  together.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  the common threat of communism has  receded\r\n\r\nand,  in the process, so has the rallying call for  ASEAN\r\n\r\nto  come  together.  Some would argue that not  even  the\r\n\r\ncommon  threat  of  terrorism is able  to  galvanise  the\r\n\r\nregion to the same extent as before.  In fact, the  level\r\n\r\nof intra-regional cooperation that should have come about\r\n\r\nto deal with terrorism could have been better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, ASEAN does not appear to have quite the same\r\n\r\npolish.    Indonesia  continues  to  struggle  with   its\r\n\r\neconomy.   Each country within the grouping  seems  beset\r\n\r\nwith  its  own problems, whether it be rising nationalism\r\n\r\nor rising unemployment.  The low point of ASEAN came with\r\n\r\nthe sacking of the Thai embassy recently\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  an  angry  mob  in Phnom Penh, with  the  authorities\r\n\r\nstanding by and looking like they did nothing to  prevent\r\n\r\nit.   The  question before us today is:  is  ASEAN  still\r\n\r\nrelevant?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that ASEAN has been more successful as a\r\n\r\npolitical  group  than as an economic one,  even  if  the\r\n\r\nincrease in the number of members has made consensus  and\r\n\r\ncollective action more difficult.  To get 10 to agree  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  more  difficult than getting six,  bearing  in\r\n\r\nmind that the 10 members are at very different stages  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and, thus, having rather different  national\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact remains that cross-border economic\r\n\r\ncooperation among member countries could have made better\r\n\r\nprogress.  Many of the proposed projects, including AFTA,\r\n\r\nhave  been very slow to take off and, in any event,  have\r\n\r\nyet to prove the result that we can all cheer about.  The\r\n\r\nissues  look set to continue.  Yet, now more  than  ever,\r\n\r\nthere is great urgency for the countries of ASEAN to  all\r\n\r\npull together in the same direction, particularly in  the\r\n\r\narea  of  economic cooperation, as we see  new  economies\r\n\r\nemerging  in  China and India that are sucking  away  all\r\n\r\npotential direct investments from the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless ASEAN member countries can come together to\r\n\r\nspeed   up  its  economic  cooperation  and  deepen   its\r\n\r\nintegration,  ASEAN, as a regional group, could  well  be\r\n\r\nmarginalised.   I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nthe  belief still exists that ASEAN is relevant and  what\r\n\r\nfurther measures the governments in the regional grouping\r\n\r\nare  taking  to speed up this cooperation and integration\r\n\r\nto deal with the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, ASEAN's role and importance\r\n\r\nin  the  eyes of the world appear to be changing, as  has\r\n\r\nbeen   eloquently  put  by  my  fellow  MPs.   The   vast\r\n\r\ndifferences that exist within ASEAN also appear to impede\r\n\r\nfurther  progress,  especially in the  field  of  perhaps\r\n\r\npolitical opinion.  Singapore has seconded the very  able\r\n\r\nMr Ong Keng Yong to be ASEAN's new Secretary-General.

How can we  ensure  that\r\n\r\nASEAN  will  continue to be one of the preferred  baskets\r\n\r\nwhen major economic powers and players feel that they  do\r\n\r\nnot want to put all their eggs in the North Asian basket?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Lee in his Budget Speech has\r\n\r\nspoken  of  the  need to deepen our economic  integration\r\n\r\nwith  our ASEAN neighbours and make ASEAN more attractive\r\n\r\nto  foreign investors.  May I ask the Minister how we are\r\n\r\nprogressing in the ASEAN-China and ASEAN-India FTAs,  and\r\n\r\nhow  successful have we been in promoting tourism  within\r\n\r\nASEAN?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Madam, in the light of what my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have already asked about ASEAN, I would  just\r\n\r\ncome to the crux of the issue.  I would just like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs as to what really is the\r\n\r\nstate of affairs in ASEAN today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, the raison d'etre of\r\n\r\nASEAN  was to build a region of stability and peace.   It\r\n\r\ntook  a  united stand against the communist threats  from\r\n\r\nthe northern Indo-Chinese countries.  It adopted a common\r\n\r\nresponse  during  the Cambodian conflict  and  played  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in isolating Vietnam at the UN.   The  end\r\n\r\nof  the  Cold  War  and  the  Cambodian  settlement  made\r\n\r\npossible  the enlargement of the Association  to  include\r\n\r\nall 10 Southeast Asian countries and the establishment of\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN Regional Forum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ASEAN today is a pale reflection of its own\r\n\r\nself  and seems almost irrelevant in tackling the  severe\r\n\r\nchallenges facing us today.  As the Foreign Minister  did\r\n\r\nsay  just  now, the world is a messier and more dangerous\r\n\r\nplace   today.    ASEAN  took  a  united  stand   against\r\n\r\nterrorism,  but even then the emphasis was  on  bilateral\r\n\r\ncooperation  than on a concerted regional approach.   And\r\n\r\nnow, the Southeast Asian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncooperation against the US-led war against terrorism  may\r\n\r\nbe   undermined  as  leaders  from  the  different  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  take  different positions on  the  US-led  war\r\n\r\nagainst Iraq, which some in the region see as anti-Islam,\r\n\r\nincluding some ASEAN leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will also find it increasingly hard to stand\r\n\r\nagainst domestic public opinion as resentment against US'\r\n\r\nunilateralist   approach  builds  up.   The   peace   and\r\n\r\nstability in Southeast Asia will encounter some  profound\r\n\r\nchallenges  in  the decades ahead.  The core  reason  for\r\n\r\nthis, in my view, is that the prevailing relationship  of\r\n\r\npower and influence will undergo significant change.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  of this is the rise of China.  The second will  be\r\n\r\nthe  maturation  of Japan into a more normal  and  multi-faceted  player  seeking to compete on more  equal  terms\r\n\r\nwith  China.   And  the  third, but  not  least,  is  the\r\n\r\nhegemony,  and like what the Foreign Minister  said,  the\r\n\r\npre-eminence of the US as the power which sees the  world\r\n\r\nin  black  and white - either you are with us or  against\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US-China-Japan's strategic balance that has long\r\n\r\nunderpinned East Asian growth and stability  is  a  fluid\r\n\r\none,  and  this  has implication on the security  of  our\r\n\r\nregion.   The  competition between the major  powers  for\r\n\r\neconomic,  political and strategic influence in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia   has  started  already  and  can  be  expected   to\r\n\r\nintensify.  You can see this in the FTAs that  China  and\r\n\r\nJapan  are  pursuing  with ASEAN.   Unfortunately,  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncohesion has taken a beating in recent years.  Historical\r\n\r\ntensions and rivalries within the grouping have not  been\r\n\r\naddressed  and  resolved in a substantive way.   Disputes\r\n\r\nbetween neighbours continue to hit the headlines such  as\r\n\r\nthe  quarrels between Cambodia and Thailand, and  between\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN is therefore not as well positioned as it\r\n\r\nmight  have been to cope with the shift in the  strategic\r\n\r\npicture.   What  would  happen  is  that  the  heightened\r\n\r\nuncertainty about the stability of the wider region  will\r\n\r\nlegitimise  the  continued  modernisation  of  the  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.   This  will  fuel  local  rivalries  even  more.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there will also be a significant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifference  among  ASEAN states  in  the  nature  of  the\r\n\r\nbalance  they seek in their relations with major  powers.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that ASEAN has reached a low ebb.  Whether it\r\n\r\nwill  remain  this  way depends, to a  great  extent,  on\r\n\r\nefforts  by  political leaders of all ASEAN countries  to\r\n\r\nsustain the strategic importance of the relations for the\r\n\r\nregion as a whole.  This would mean that they should  try\r\n\r\nto  resolve  whatever issues they face  and  not  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, ASEAN states must also have\r\n\r\nrealistic expectations of each other.  A common complaint\r\n\r\nthat  I  hear  when  I  visit  ASEAN  countries  is  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is not doing enough to pour money  into  their\r\n\r\neconomies  to help them.  They continue to see  Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  selfish rich kid, which should open up its  purse-strings  to  invest in their countries,  never  mind  the\r\n\r\ninvestment  risk  is high, because of  their  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  problems.   Such  high  expectations  from  our\r\n\r\nneighbours  can  fuel  tensions  when  they   feel   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not being helpful.  But, Madam,  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo  is  undergoing great economic uncertainties and,  as\r\n\r\nyou  have  heard  in the recent Budget  debate,  our  own\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  also  clamouring  for  more  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister's views on how\r\n\r\nASEAN can be strengthened, given the circumstances.  And,\r\n\r\nat  the  same  time,  I would like to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  feels that the expectations  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nneighbours have moderated in these difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Madam, I too would like to join\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues in expressing my concerns about the  state\r\n\r\nof affairs in ASEAN and its future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, ASEAN has been perceived by\r\n\r\nmany as an organisation that appears to have lost some of\r\n\r\nits earlier momentum and directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to the Asian financial crisis, ASEAN had been\r\n\r\nan organisation that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowed its members much political and social contact and\r\n\r\nplayed  a  pivotal role in forging regional  cooperation.\r\n\r\nMany  of  ASEAN's economies were regarded as amongst  the\r\n\r\nmost  dynamic  in  the world and full  of  promise.   The\r\n\r\nability  of  its  member states to  engage  in  dialogue,\r\n\r\nconsultation  and confidence building in a  peaceful  and\r\n\r\namicable manner was seen as its most positive point.  Its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  lay  the  foundation for  regional  economic\r\n\r\ncooperation offered much hope for its 500 million people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the economic crisis that engulfed the\r\n\r\nregion  following the onset of the Asian financial crisis\r\n\r\nin  1997 changed all that.  ASEAN's inability to come  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  coordinated or concerted response to tackle  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  only  served to show its weakness at  a  time  of\r\n\r\ngreat crisis.  Instead of working out a unified course of\r\n\r\naction, many ASEAN member countries went about their  own\r\n\r\nway  in dealing with the crisis.  Indonesia and Thailand,\r\n\r\nfor  example, turned to IMF, and Malaysia instituted  its\r\n\r\nown  capital  controls as the way  of  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis.  Now this had the effect  of  reducing\r\n\r\nthe region's appeal to outsiders, particularly, coming at\r\n\r\na  time  when China was becoming more and more attractive\r\n\r\nto foreign investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the much touted ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA)\r\n\r\nwas  met  with some scepticism.  While intra-ASEAN  trade\r\n\r\nhas  increased, there remains significant  bugbears  like\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  refusal  to bring down  tariffs  on  imported\r\n\r\nvehicles  for  a  few  more years  and  the  Philippines'\r\n\r\nreluctance to lower tariffs on petrochemicals.  There has\r\n\r\nalso  been  difficulty  in  drawing  up  procedures   and\r\n\r\nstandards for imports into the various countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the man-in-the-street, ASEAN remains much a\r\n\r\nmystery.   They do not even know what ASEAN means.   Many\r\n\r\ncannot  even name all the 10 member countries.  To  them,\r\n\r\nASEAN is, at most, a talk shop for political leaders  and\r\n\r\nsome  businessmen  that they hear about  or  see  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers from time to time.  Many do not even bother to\r\n\r\nread  articles on ASEAN.  And this, to me,  Madam,  is  a\r\n\r\npity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the man-in-the-street too, ASEAN is far from\r\n\r\nbeing a united force.  All they see is the negative side,\r\n\r\nwhich is reported in the newspapers, like the quarrelling\r\n\r\nneighbours,  for  example,  the  regular  spats   between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia and the border skirmishes  between\r\n\r\nThailand and Myanmar.  A few weeks ago, when a Thai movie\r\n\r\nactress  allegedly  made  some  sensitive  remarks  about\r\n\r\nAngkor  Wat belonging to the Thais, this led to  days  of\r\n\r\nriots  in  Phnom  Penh  as  the  Thai  Embassy  and  Thai\r\n\r\nbusinesses'  premises were attacked  by  Cambodian  mobs.\r\n\r\nAt  a  time when the whole world was worried sick  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  war  would  break out in Iraq,  there  was  this\r\n\r\nsudden  danger  of actually a war occurring  between  two\r\n\r\nmember  countries of ASEAN.  Nobody would  have  imagined\r\n\r\nthat the Thai airforce was already on the alert and ready\r\n\r\nto send its planes into Cambodian territory.  So much for\r\n\r\nregional peace and cooperation.  Fortunately, good  sense\r\n\r\nhas  prevailed.  The matter is now being resolved, to put\r\n\r\nit very diplomatically, through diplomatic channels.  But\r\n\r\nthis   is   an   incident  that  will  leave   scars   on\r\n\r\nrelationship.  And it is not helpful to ASEAN's image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, last year when I spoke on this topic, I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that ASEAN was fast being lost  on  the  radar\r\n\r\nscreen of outsiders.  Many perceived the member countries\r\n\r\nas  simply not trusting one another enough to the  extent\r\n\r\nthat  ASEAN was incapable of negotiating collective deals\r\n\r\nwith  outsiders.   Even Rodolfo Severino,  the  Secretary\r\n\r\nGeneral of ASEAN who stepped down last year, had this  to\r\n\r\nsay, and I quote him:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"People in the region, including those from the\r\n\r\nbusiness  sector,  don't recognise  their  stake  in  the\r\n\r\ndestiny and cohesion of ASEAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, ASEAN, if properly managed again, holds so much\r\n\r\npotential for its people.  ASEAN solidarity is central to\r\n\r\nits  success.  We need to speed up the pace  of  economic\r\n\r\nintegration and trade liberalisation, make sure that  all\r\n\r\nmember states are fully committed to the success of  AFTA\r\n\r\nand to pursue more intra-ASEAN trade.  The possibility of\r\n\r\na China-ASEAN free trade area excites me.  According to a\r\n\r\nreport I read in The Economist ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Tan, can you please wrap up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Yes. --- trade between China and\r\n\r\nASEAN  has grown three-fold in the past decade and  helps\r\n\r\nus to lessen our dependence on America, Europe and Japan,\r\n\r\ncountries which are anyway in the doldrums.  Can you  now\r\n\r\nimagine  the prospects of a China-ASEAN free trade  area,\r\n\r\nof  a  market of more than 1.7 billion people with  goods\r\n\r\nmoving  about  freely?  ASEAN has been rudderless  for  a\r\n\r\nwhile.  And I would like to hear the Minister's views  on\r\n\r\nhow   Singapore   can  contribute  to   closer   regional\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  economic integration and  to  show  the\r\n\r\nworld that ASEAN is back in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, the only\r\n\r\nmultilateral  security institution in East  Asia  is  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Regional  Forum, set up in 1994.  It  provided  an\r\n\r\nimportant forum for dialogue and for confidence  building\r\n\r\nbetween  states.  One critical characteristic of the  ARF\r\n\r\nwas  that  it  was launched by ASEAN for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nengaging  and  influencing the postures  that  the  major\r\n\r\npowers adopted towards Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's participation in the ARF provided the\r\n\r\nopportunity  for difficult issues, such  as  the  dispute\r\n\r\nover  the  Spratlys, to be broached.  In the  year  2000,\r\n\r\nNorth   Korea  joined  the  ARF,  allowing  the   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters  of the US and North Korea to have  a  dialogue\r\n\r\nfor  the first time under the Bush administration in July\r\n\r\n2000.  Notwithstanding these pluses, the ARF has not  met\r\n\r\nup  with promise.  It has been nothing more than a  forum\r\n\r\nfor  dialogue.  It did not contribute meaningfully to the\r\n\r\nresolution of the East Timor conflict.  It does not  have\r\n\r\nany influence on the current escalating nuclear crisis in\r\n\r\nNorth Korea, nor has it contributed to the present debate\r\n\r\nover  a  war against Iraq.  Indeed, it is not clear  that\r\n\r\nthe  Bush  administration views the ARF as essential,  or\r\n\r\neven important, in its own security calculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key challenge of the ARF is to persuade the US not\r\n\r\nto continue with its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunilateralist approach to international relations but  to\r\n\r\noffer support to multilateral cooperation in its security\r\n\r\napproaches in the region.  We need to strengthen the  ARF\r\n\r\nto  take  on the challenges of living in a dangerous  and\r\n\r\nunpredictable world.  After all, the middle  and  smaller\r\n\r\npowers of the region are arguably the most vulnerable  to\r\n\r\nany   serious  deterioration  in  the  regional  security\r\n\r\nenvironment that results from major power rivalry and the\r\n\r\nfree  movement  of  strategic powers.  These  middle  and\r\n\r\nsmaller  powers have the most to gain from some  capacity\r\n\r\nto  shape and influence the security environment and they\r\n\r\nshould  put  deliberate effort to put this capacity  into\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether Singapore,\r\n\r\non  its part, is working towards a stronger ARF and if he\r\n\r\nthinks  that ASEAN, in its weakened state, can remain  in\r\n\r\nthe driver's seat in this process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Second Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Madam, Dr Ong Chit Chung and other Members have\r\n\r\nnoted  the  perceived decline of ASEAN  post-Suharto  and\r\n\r\nasked  about ASEAN's continued relevance and measures  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Jayakumar has said, post-September 11, the\r\n\r\nmajor  powers  have  rediscovered ASEAN's  importance  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining  stability in Southeast Asia  and  countering\r\n\r\nterrorism.   The  US,  China, Japan and  India  are  also\r\n\r\nseeking closer economic cooperation, including free trade\r\n\r\narrangements  with ASEAN.  They recognise  the  strategic\r\n\r\nand  economic  importance of ASEAN as a  stable  regional\r\n\r\ngrouping  and  a  growing market of  500  million  people\r\n\r\nastride the trade route between Europe and East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the\r\n\r\nfall  of Suharto in 1998, it is true that ASEAN has  lost\r\n\r\nmuch  of its lustre as one of the fastest growing regions\r\n\r\nin the world.  In 1997, as short-term portfolio investors\r\n\r\nfled  the  region  and regional currencies  fell  sharply\r\n\r\nagainst the US dollar, Thailand and Indonesia had to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nturn  to  IMF  and  the World Bank for financial  rescue.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  had to introduce capital controls to  stabilise\r\n\r\nits financial and stock markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The region went through a period of economic\r\n\r\ncontraction and political instability in 1998  and  1999.\r\n\r\nIn year 2000, as signs of recovery emerged, unfortunately\r\n\r\nthe  IT  bubble  burst,  hurting  investors  and  denting\r\n\r\nconsumers'  confidence  in  the  major  export   markets.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rise of China has sucked away much foreign\r\n\r\ndirect investment.  Then came September 11 and the  shock\r\n\r\nof global terrorism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these setbacks, ASEAN has gradually regained\r\n\r\nits  footing.   Political stability has improved.   There\r\n\r\nhas  been some economic growth, partly driven by domestic\r\n\r\ndemand  and  by increased revenue from oil exports,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the  global  economic  environment  has  remained\r\n\r\nunfavourable.   However,  the  outlook  has  become  more\r\n\r\nuncertain with the Iraq crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with severe challenges, it is vital that ASEAN\r\n\r\nremains  united  and outward-looking.  During  the  Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis,  ASEAN  strove  to  regain  investors'\r\n\r\ninterest  and  confidence  by accelerating  the  pace  of\r\n\r\neconomic liberalisation through the ASEAN Free Trade Area\r\n\r\n(AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st January 2003, the original six members of\r\n\r\nASEAN  have  lowered  the tariffs  on  all  the  products\r\n\r\ncommitted under AFTA to between 0% and 5%.  This includes\r\n\r\nmore  than  98%  of all tariff lines that  exist  in  the\r\n\r\noriginal six ASEAN countries.  What remains is to  reduce\r\n\r\nnon-tariff   barriers,  prevent   backsliding   in   some\r\n\r\nsensitive  products  such  as automative  components  and\r\n\r\neliminate tariffs further across the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 2002, at the 8th ASEAN Summit in Phnom\r\n\r\nPenh,  PM  Goh proposed the vision of the ASEAN  Economic\r\n\r\nCommunity.  It will provide a tangible end-point  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  economic initiatives within ASEAN, such  as  the\r\n\r\nAFTA, the AIA and the Roadmap for Integration of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASEAN  (RIA).  In many ways, the ASEAN Economic Community\r\n\r\n(AEC)  could  be  regarded as the economic  component  of\r\n\r\nASEAN  Vision 2020.  It envisages the free flow of goods,\r\n\r\nservices, technology and skilled manpower within ASEAN as\r\n\r\nan integrated economic grouping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN officials are studying and defining the AEC\r\n\r\nconcept  for  report  to  the ASEAN  Economic  Ministers'\r\n\r\nMeeting in September.  It would then be presented to  the\r\n\r\nASEAN Leaders' Meeting in Bali in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AEC embraces both economic integration and\r\n\r\neconomic  competitiveness aspects.  While much  has  been\r\n\r\nachieved  to free up the flow of goods and,  to  a  lower\r\n\r\nextent, services within ASEAN, further liberalisation and\r\n\r\nintegration   are   necessary  for   ASEAN   to   compete\r\n\r\neffectively with China as a single market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help ensure that the newer members of ASEAN are\r\n\r\nnot  left  behind,  PM  Goh proposed  in  year  2000  the\r\n\r\nInitiatives for ASEAN Integration (IAI).  Its emphasis is\r\n\r\non  training and capacity building.  It helps to mobilise\r\n\r\nresources  from  within and outside ASEAN  to  close  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment gap among ASEAN members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides enhancing internal cooperation, ASEAN must\r\n\r\nremain   outward-looking.   ASEAN's  combined   strategic\r\n\r\nweight  has  enabled  it to play a  significant  role  in\r\n\r\nregional  initiatives, such as the ASEAN  Regional  Forum\r\n\r\n(ARF),   the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  (APEC)\r\n\r\nForum,  the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) and the Forum  for\r\n\r\nEast   Asia   and  Latin  America  Cooperation  (FEALAC).\r\n\r\nThrough these forums, as well as the dialogue process  of\r\n\r\nASEAN+3   and   ASEAN-Plus,   ASEAN   has   engaged   and\r\n\r\nstrengthened  ties  with  powers  outside   the   region,\r\n\r\nincluding the US, EU, Japan, China, the Republic of Korea\r\n\r\nand India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-September 11, ASEAN's strategic importance has\r\n\r\nincreased.   ASEAN  members  are  cooperating  with   one\r\n\r\nanother and with other countries to combat the global\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreat  of  terrorism.  Security and stability are  vital\r\n\r\nfor   investor  confidence  in  ASEAN,  which  has   good\r\n\r\npotential as an alternative business location to China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aware of ASEAN's strategic importance and economic\r\n\r\npotential, the US, China, Japan and India are seeking  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  economic  ties with  ASEAN  through  FTAs  or\r\n\r\ncloser  economic partnerships.  The ASEAN-China Framework\r\n\r\nAgreement  on  Comprehensive  Economic  Cooperation   was\r\n\r\nsigned  at the 8th ASEAN Summit last year.  The objective\r\n\r\nis  to  create an ASEAN-China Free Trade Area  within  10\r\n\r\nyears.   Not to be outdone, Japan has proposed the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership.  The US came up\r\n\r\nwith its Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative, starting with a\r\n\r\nseries   of  bilateral  trade  and  investment  framework\r\n\r\nagreements.   India, Australia and New Zealand  are  also\r\n\r\nseeking to enhance economic cooperation with ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN continues to provide the framework under which\r\n\r\npeace   has  prevailed  in  the  region.   Despite   some\r\n\r\nbilateral  problems,  such  as  the  Thai-Myanmar  border\r\n\r\ndisputes,   recent  Thai-Cambodian  tensions,   and   our\r\n\r\nproblems  with Malaysia, ASEAN has continued to focus  on\r\n\r\ncommon objectives to enhance cooperation, both internally\r\n\r\nand  with  external  powers.   This  is  one  of  ASEAN's\r\n\r\nstrengths.  ASEAN Ministers and officials meet  regularly\r\n\r\non  a  wide  range of issues and responsibilities.   They\r\n\r\nbuild  up  friendship and understanding in  the  process.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a  conscious  effort to  put  aside  bilateral\r\n\r\nproblems  and move ahead with cooperation for the  common\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continues to place strong emphasis on\r\n\r\nenhancing  our  ties  with other  ASEAN  countries,  both\r\n\r\nbilaterally   and   as  a  group.    Our   fortunes   are\r\n\r\ninextricably linked with those of the region.  Except for\r\n\r\nour  current  difficulties with Malaysia,  our  relations\r\n\r\nwith  ASEAN are excellent.  As a small but more developed\r\n\r\nmember  of ASEAN, we have to manage expectations  of  us.\r\n\r\nWithin  our  capabilities,  we  have  contributed  ideas,\r\n\r\nvision and training resources to help build up ASEAN  and\r\n\r\nmaintain its relevance and focus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than 50% of our technical assistance funds have gone\r\n\r\nto  our  ASEAN  neighbours.  We are one  of  the  biggest\r\n\r\ninvestors in their economies.  We strive to be a reliable\r\n\r\npartner and the business hub of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked whether ASEAN has expanded\r\n\r\ntoo   fast  in  terms  of  membership.   To  answer  this\r\n\r\nquestion,  we  need  to remind ourselves  why  ASEAN  was\r\n\r\nformed.   Founded  in 1967, its primary objectives  were,\r\n\r\nand  still are, firstly, peace and stability in Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia   and,  secondly,  economic  growth  and  prosperity\r\n\r\nthrough mutual cooperation.  With the end of the Cold War\r\n\r\nand  the  resolution of the Cambodian  issue,  the  Indo-Chinese  states of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were  eager\r\n\r\nto  join  ASEAN to enhance their stability and  catch  up\r\n\r\nwith economic development.  Myanmar had opened up and was\r\n\r\nalso  keen  on  ASEAN  membership.   With  the  four  new\r\n\r\nmembers, ASEAN fulfilled the founding vision of ASEAN-10,\r\n\r\na  community of 10 Southeast Asian countries  living  and\r\n\r\ngrowing together in peace, harmony and stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other regional organisations, the expansion of\r\n\r\nASEAN  presents  problems of disparity  and  integration.\r\n\r\nThe  newer and less developed members need assistance  to\r\n\r\nclose  the development gap and more time to open up their\r\n\r\nmarkets    to   foreign   investment   and   competition.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, they have been very positive in wanting  to\r\n\r\ncatch   up  and  integrate  with  ASEAN  and  the  global\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An expanded ASEAN has its advantages. Banding\r\n\r\ntogether  the Southeast Asian countries into a  community\r\n\r\nof  500 million people has provided the critical mass for\r\n\r\nASEAN   to   better  stand  up  to  global  and  regional\r\n\r\ncompetition.  ASEAN-10 also contributes to increasing our\r\n\r\ninfluence and bargaining power vis-a-vis other states and\r\n\r\nregional groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I will now turn to the questions on the ASEAN\r\n\r\nRegional Forum (ARF) raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung  and  Ms\r\n\r\nIrene Ng.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formed in 1994, the ARF was intended to be a forum\r\n\r\nto  build  confidence  and trust in  the  region  through\r\n\r\nconfidence-building measures.  It was never meant to be a\r\n\r\nformal decision-making or problem-solving organisation on\r\n\r\nsecurity  issues.  This is to encourage member countries,\r\n\r\nincluding the major powers, to engage each other  frankly\r\n\r\nand  constructively.  Over the years, the ARF has allowed\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues, such as the South China  Sea  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation  in  East  Timor, to be  discussed  in  a  non-threatening environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, the ARF has initiated discussions on\r\n\r\nthe  implications  of terrorism and considered  practical\r\n\r\nways  in  which the ARF can support international efforts\r\n\r\nto  counter terrorism.  A series of ARF counter-terrorism\r\n\r\nworkshops  have been conducted.  The ARF  itself  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered a confidence-building measure.  Today, the ARF\r\n\r\nremains the only multi-lateral security forum in the Asia\r\n\r\nPacific.   It  has  helped create a more predictable  and\r\n\r\nstable  pattern of relationships among the major  powers,\r\n\r\nand between the major powers and Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the ARF, ASEAN has played the role of\r\n\r\nbringing   together  all  the  diverse   members   in   a\r\n\r\ncomfortable environment.  ASEAN will continue to play its\r\n\r\nrole.  However, we remain aware that the ARF cannot  move\r\n\r\ntoo  fast.  It is important that members feel comfortable\r\n\r\nwith the pace of development.  This will ensure that  the\r\n\r\nARF remains practical and relevant to its members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other aspect about the ARF is that it enables\r\n\r\nquiet   bilateral  discussions  without  the   glare   of\r\n\r\npublicity.   For example, in 1995, the ARF  provided  the\r\n\r\noccasion   for   then-US  Secretary  of   State,   Warren\r\n\r\nChristopher,  and  then-Chinese  Foreign  Minister   Qian\r\n\r\nQichen  to  meet,  following  the  downturn  in  US-China\r\n\r\nrelations  over  the visit of then-Taiwan  President  Lee\r\n\r\nTenghui to Cornell University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that\r\n\r\nwe  are  running slightly behind time and  to  keep  your\r\n\r\nspeeches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshort.

It has its  ups  and  its\r\n\r\ndowns.   It  is  also filled with thrill and  excitement,\r\n\r\nlike  a  roller-coaster ride.  But we have  to  take  all\r\n\r\nthese in our stride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, there are prospects for a change for\r\n\r\nthe  better.  We must not lose heart, but have confidence\r\n\r\nthat  things  will work out.  I am glad, therefore,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Malaysia have committed the  Pedra  Branca\r\n\r\nissue to the International Court of Justice.  This  is  a\r\n\r\nstep in the right direction.  This is an objective way, a\r\n\r\npeaceful way, to deal with an outstanding problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask whether both nations have ratified the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Agreement to commit the issue to  ICJ.   I  also\r\n\r\nwish to ask the Minister what are the next few steps both\r\n\r\nnations have to take to present their case to the ICJ and\r\n\r\nwhen the ICJ is likely to make a ruling on Pedra Branca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the total package approach has been\r\n\r\nabandoned  by  Malaysia,  what is  the  latest  stage  of\r\n\r\nnegotiations  on water and other issues.   How  does  the\r\n\r\nMinister see our relations with Malaysia evolving in  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  years?  Will both countries evolve  a  win-win\r\n\r\nformula to the mutual benefit of both?  What will be  the\r\n\r\nimpact  of  Islamic  influence  and  ascent  of  PAS   on\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia  relations?   I  believe   that   with\r\n\r\ngoodwill  on  both sides of the causeway,  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  can work together for the common  good  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  in  a win-win situation or prosper-thy-neighbour\r\n\r\npolicy.   We should also deepen our bilateral  ties  with\r\n\r\nemphasis  on  people-to-people relationship.   We  should\r\n\r\nhave    more   cultural   exchanges,   student-to-student\r\n\r\ncontacts, and visits by officials and parliamentarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> The outstanding bilateral\r\n\r\nissues between the two countries have yet to be resolved.\r\n\r\nThey include the price of water and its continued supply,\r\n\r\nthe  location  of  Malaysia's  Customs,  Immigration  and\r\n\r\nQuarantine facilities, among other issues.

It is like a plane trying to  take  off\r\n\r\nwith  a broken wing.  It is not much good loading up  the\r\n\r\nplane with good stuff when it cannot get very far on  the\r\n\r\nrunway.   The question is how to build the trust  needed.\r\n\r\nI  would say, slowly.  But there must be an attempt  made\r\n\r\nin  this  direction.  And perhaps we can start  with  the\r\n\r\nsmallest problem that can be resolved first, or embark on\r\n\r\nbilateral   cooperation  projects  that  can  be   easily\r\n\r\nimplemented,  and that will reap real benefits  for  both\r\n\r\nsides.   For example, both countries could jointly embark\r\n\r\non  road  shows  to woo tourists to both countries  as  a\r\n\r\npackage.  With a series of small win-win successes  under\r\n\r\ntheir  belt,  perhaps both countries can then  feel  more\r\n\r\nconfident  of tackling the more complicated  issues  that\r\n\r\nrequire good faith and trust from both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead of the general elections in Malaysia,\r\n\r\nbilateral relations are expected to take another beating,\r\n\r\nas  politicians tend to resort to the well-worn tactic of\r\n\r\nusing  Singapore  as  a bogeyman to whip  up  nationalist\r\n\r\nsentiments.    Whilst   such   swings   complicate    the\r\n\r\nrelationship with Malaysia, Singapore has made  it  clear\r\n\r\nthat it values its relations with Malaysia.  Indeed, even\r\n\r\nat  the  height of the dispute between the two  countries\r\n\r\nover  the outstanding issues in January this year, amidst\r\n\r\ntalk  of  war  in the Malaysian media, our  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs took pains to stress that  their  common\r\n\r\nbilateral interests exceed their differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister how he sees cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two countries being stepped up  for  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Madam,\r\n\r\nSingapore-Malaysia relations are so mired  with  problems\r\n\r\nthat sometimes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\none  wonders whether it is worth all the trouble to  keep\r\n\r\nit   afloat   or  to  believe  that  a  win-win   working\r\n\r\nrelationship  is at all possible.  One can understand  if\r\n\r\nthat  kind  of  feeling  crops up  every  now  and  then,\r\n\r\nespecially lately, but one cannot forget the fact that we\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be neighbours and we need to  make  the\r\n\r\nbest of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our post-independence history is short, but we have\r\n\r\nwitnessed  many  rounds of acrimony, in fact,  Singapore-bashing.   Singapore took all that in her  stride,  until\r\n\r\nrecently,  when Singapore decided to lay bare  the  facts\r\n\r\nonce  and  for  all  to  clear the  air  about  the  many\r\n\r\naccusations  that  were thrown at Singapore  over  water,\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca and the bridge issues, among others.   Even\r\n\r\ntalk  about  war was bandied about irresponsibly.   Well,\r\n\r\nthat was how we saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia saw things differently. In fact, the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  media  had  carried  out  their  campaign   so\r\n\r\nsuccessfully that many, if not most, Malaysians swallowed\r\n\r\ntheir  story hook, line and sinker, much to the detriment\r\n\r\nof people-to-people relationship.  There were exceptions.\r\n\r\nFor example, there were Malaysians who practically called\r\n\r\non  the  Malaysian government to stop the wayang  and  to\r\n\r\nstick  to the facts and principles of the issues at hand,\r\n\r\nlike what Singapore did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are: what are the lessons Singapore\r\n\r\nshould learn from this?  How would the recent spat colour\r\n\r\nthe  way  we  handle bilateral relations?   We  have  our\r\n\r\nperspectives,  and they theirs.  Where  shall  the  twain\r\n\r\nmeet?   Recognising  the  importance  of  the  Singapore-Malaysia  relations,  beyond  water  and  Pedra   Branca,\r\n\r\nespecially  in  the  context of the global  and  regional\r\n\r\nfight  against terrorism, how would MFA go about  mending\r\n\r\nfences and bridging bilateral relations and bringing them\r\n\r\nto an even keel again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, with President Megawati\r\n\r\nin  Jakarta, Singapore-Indonesia relations have  improved\r\n\r\nover time.

This was an important move by a Singapore company,\r\n\r\nemphasising  the  commitment to assist  Indonesia  during\r\n\r\nthese  troubled times.  STT won the bid by paying a hefty\r\n\r\n50%  premium  over the market price.  Yet, anti-Singapore\r\n\r\nsentiment was strong.  Compare this with the situation  a\r\n\r\nmonth  later,  when Indonesia lost the  ICJ  judgment  to\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  resulting  in  the  loss  of  sovereignty  and\r\n\r\ncontrol of Sipadan and Ligitan islands.  Considering  the\r\n\r\nstrong sense of Indonesian nationalism, it was surprising\r\n\r\nthat there was a no big adverse reaction to Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore should mull over this. First, a review\r\n\r\nshould  be  made  of  the  current  state  of  Singapore-Indonesia relations.  Second, such a review should  focus\r\n\r\non  specific  policies that would advance both  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  Indonesian  interests.  And third, while  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService  Exchange  Programme is an excellent  initiative,\r\n\r\nmore  should  be  done  to broaden the  linkages  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Indonesia, particularly in the NGO  sector.\r\n\r\nMuch  of  Singapore's interaction with Indonesia revolves\r\n\r\naround  investment relations.  Yet, the over-emphasis  on\r\n\r\nthis  area  may  inadvertently  bring  with  it  unwanted\r\n\r\nperception   of   Singapore  as  being   overly   profit-orientated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore needs to consider balancing the strong\r\n\r\neconomic emphasis in the relationship with equal emphasis\r\n\r\non building institution and institutional linkages. It is\r\n\r\nthrough  institution, both government and  non-government\r\n\r\norganisations,  that  the next generation  of  Indonesian\r\n\r\nleaders   will   emerge   and  engage   their   Singapore\r\n\r\ncounterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, I would like to echo\r\n\r\nwhat my GPC Chairman said that we need to engage a wider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrange  of  new  players  in  Indonesia  beyond  the   top\r\n\r\nleadership in politics and military sectors in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSingapore's   perceived  obsession  today  with   picking\r\n\r\nwinners  to  nurture  makes  little  sense  in  a   fluid\r\n\r\npolitical   environment  where  the  absence  of   strong\r\n\r\nleadership  would be normal in the short to medium  term.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have to put more emphasis on conducting dialogues\r\n\r\nand  building greater ties with its emerging  leaders  in\r\n\r\nboth NGOs and academia as well as in political parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken part in some dialogues in Jakarta\r\n\r\ninvolving  civil  society  activists,  academics,   young\r\n\r\npoliticians  and the media.

Of  course,  they  might  use   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to score some points.

I would like to thank the Members  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken.   I  do not intend to go into a great explanation\r\n\r\nof  our relations because only on 25th January, I gave  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  statement  of bilateral  relations.   This\r\n\r\nsets  out  the facts of the various issues, the published\r\n\r\ndocuments, and also set out the steps forward. So  may  I\r\n\r\njust   confine  myself  in  responding  through   general\r\n\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung when he said that\r\n\r\nMalaysia-Singapore relations are like a yo-yo.   They  go\r\n\r\nup  and  down.  I think differences are bound  to  emerge\r\n\r\nbetween close neighbours.  But while that may be so,  the\r\n\r\nfact  remains that our countries are closely intertwined.\r\n\r\nThe  areas  of  our  common interests  have  always  been\r\n\r\ngreater  than that of our disagreements. It is  for  that\r\n\r\nreason  that I believe that Malaysia and Singapore should\r\n\r\nnot  allow  specific disagreements to affect the  overall\r\n\r\ntenor  of bilateral relations.  We should try to  address\r\n\r\ndisagreements   in   a  calm  and   mature   way,   using\r\n\r\nnegotiations  where possible, and if it is  not  possible\r\n\r\nthrough  negotiations,  and  if  negotiations  have  been\r\n\r\nexhausted,  then  we should have recourse  to  the  legal\r\n\r\nprocess.   And  we  should continue to cooperate  in  the\r\n\r\nareas which lend themselves to cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this vein, I want to draw attention of Members to\r\n\r\nthe recent comments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah  Badawi  and\r\n\r\nForeign Minister Syed Hamid Albar.  Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nAbdullah Badawi was quoted to say on 3rd March that there\r\n\r\nwas  \"an  inextricable relationship between Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nSingapore. There will be differences of opinion  on  many\r\n\r\nthings.  There will perhaps be periods of tension because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not see things from the same perspective.  But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve that the relationship with Malaysia and Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  not deteriorate to the extent that it will  involve\r\n\r\nus in any kind of conflict\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein on 7th March 2003, Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister Syed Hamid Albar was quoted in Dubai as  saying,\r\n\r\n\"Both countries value peace and stability and that is why\r\n\r\nwe  have  agreed to refer the issue (he was referring  to\r\n\r\nPedra  Branca)  to  the  ICJ.   The  dispute  should  not\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the long-term relations between  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome these sentiments. Differences no doubt\r\n\r\nremain in the bilateral relationship, but so do our inter-linkages  and  the  tremendous  potential  for  bilateral\r\n\r\ncooperation. I think it is a sound approach to try to get\r\n\r\nbeyond  our  disagreements  and  to  focus  on  long-term\r\n\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we are already doing that to some\r\n\r\nextent.    Both  countries  cooperate  in   the   various\r\n\r\ninternational  foras.   In the domestic  security  field,\r\n\r\nthere  is  close  cooperation between  both  sides,  both\r\n\r\npolice forces.  In defence, there are bilateral exchanges\r\n\r\nand  common  exercises.   Our two economies  are  closely\r\n\r\nintertwined.   Malaysia  was  Singapore's   top   trading\r\n\r\npartner  in  2002, while Singapore has always been  among\r\n\r\nMalaysia's  top trading partners.  There are also  strong\r\n\r\nties  between the people of our two countries.  Not  just\r\n\r\npolitical  and official contacts, but cultural,  business\r\n\r\nand  social ones.  These contacts are important  as  they\r\n\r\nnurture  familiarity and mutual understanding.  I believe\r\n\r\nthis  helps  to preserve positive elements  in  bilateral\r\n\r\nties   by  fostering  institutional  and  personal  links\r\n\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked specific questions as to the\r\n\r\nstate   of  the  ratification  process  of  the   Special\r\n\r\nAgreement  that was signed on 6th February.  Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat on 17th February 2003, we informed Malaysia that the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government has ratified the Special  Agreement\r\n\r\nand  that  we  are  ready  to  exchange  instruments   of\r\n\r\nratification  at  a  mutually convenient  date.   We  are\r\n\r\nawaiting  a notification from Malaysia on when  they  are\r\n\r\nready to exchange instruments of ratification.  I am sure\r\n\r\nthis will be done very soon.  And when that is done, that\r\n\r\nwill  be one more step in the process.  I cannot give  an\r\n\r\nexact  date. After ratification, both sides could have  a\r\n\r\njoint letter to the Court (ICJ), and then the Court  will\r\n\r\nget  seized  with  the matter.  Then  there  are  certain\r\n\r\ntimeframes for filing memorials, replies, rejoinders, and\r\n\r\nso  on.  And as to when the Court will actually hand down\r\n\r\nits  decision,  this depends on the workload  before  the\r\n\r\nCourt.  But I must say that I do not see a decision being\r\n\r\nhanded  down earlier than two-and-a-half to three  years'\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to sum up, I hope Members will understand when I\r\n\r\ndo  not  go into great detail but just confine myself  to\r\n\r\nsaying  that  we  seek  a cooperative  relationship  with\r\n\r\nMalaysia based on mutual benefit and mutual respect.   If\r\n\r\nwe  can  put our disagreements aside, and manage them  in\r\n\r\naccordance with internationally recognised conventions on\r\n\r\ndispute  settlements,  I think we can  move  forward  for\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit.   Dr Ong Chit Chung asked  what  is  the\r\n\r\nlatest  state  of affairs on negotiations. There  are  no\r\n\r\nnegotiations at the moment for the reasons  that  I  have\r\n\r\nexplained in my 25th January statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Indonesia, I thank the Members who have spoken.\r\n\r\nLet me say that we have good relations with the Indonesia\r\n\r\nleadership.  There have been many exchanges between  both\r\n\r\nthe  countries.  Prime Minister Goh visited  in  December\r\n\r\n2002 and met with President Megawati and other Indonesian\r\n\r\nleaders and influential policy-makers. As I said earlier,\r\n\r\nour  Prime Minister was the first foreign leader to visit\r\n\r\nJakarta after the Bali bombings.  This was to demonstrate\r\n\r\nour confidence in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with Members who have spoken that\r\n\r\nrelations  between  Singapore  and  Indonesia  should  be\r\n\r\nbroadened.   In  other  words,  it  should  not  be  just\r\n\r\nGovernment-to-Government at the top level. That has never\r\n\r\nbeen   our  approach.   Various  Ministers  have  visited\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  vice-versa.  And we are  also  broadening\r\n\r\ncontacts with people in other sectors. Whenever we go  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  for  example,  we  meet  a  cross-section  of\r\n\r\ninfluential people, whether they are journalists or think-tank  people.  At the last occasion, we have met  with  a\r\n\r\ncross-section of leaders in the Muslim organisations.  We\r\n\r\nalso  have  contacts between officials at  the  MFA-DEPLU\r\n\r\nExchange, which is an annual event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister went to Indonesia, he\r\n\r\nproposed  the Indonesia-Singapore Civil Service  Exchange\r\n\r\nProgramme  (CSEP).   I  think that will  further  enhance\r\n\r\nanother  dimension of our cooperation.  I agree  with  Dr\r\n\r\nWarren Lee and others who have stressed that we must have\r\n\r\npeople-to-people level relations.  And  in  this  regard,\r\n\r\nwhen  Dr  Warren  Lee asked how we can  involve  ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, I should say that they may want to  contact\r\n\r\norganisations like the Singapore International Foundation\r\n\r\n(SIF).  They  have  despatched volunteer  specialists  to\r\n\r\nIndonesia  on  many  community  projects,  including  the\r\n\r\ntraining  of  doctors in hospitals in  various  parts  of\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   Singaporeans  can  get  involved   in   such\r\n\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Ong Chit Chung and Ms Irene Ng. Ms\r\n\r\nIrene  Ng  had  noted  that the  Indonesian  society  has\r\n\r\nbecome  increasingly complex.  It is really going through\r\n\r\na   difficult   transitional  period.   The   change   of\r\n\r\ngovernment in 1998 has ushered in a new Indonesia  and  a\r\n\r\nfar  more  complicated political equation  and  dynamics.\r\n\r\nHere  Dr  Ong Chit Chung had mentioned about the role  of\r\n\r\nreligion and Islamic groups.  It is part of the equation.\r\n\r\nThere  are  now  more power centres which have  influence\r\n\r\nover  overall Indonesian policies.  This change has  made\r\n\r\nthe  conduct of our bilateral relations more complex  and\r\n\r\nthe  challenge for us is to find ways and means to manage\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelationship  and  to  maintain  the  good  relations  we\r\n\r\ncurrently enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Dr Ong and other Members that the\r\n\r\npoints  they have made are uppermost in our minds  as  we\r\n\r\nseek to maintain good relations with an Indonesia that is\r\n\r\nchanging and will continue to change in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Singapore became a member of the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council at the time of great change  and  great\r\n\r\ntragedy  in the world.  Madam, now that Singapore  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger a member of the Security Council, should we  allow\r\n\r\nourselves  to just fade away from the world stage  or  is\r\n\r\nthere still a role for us?  I think that Singapore has  a\r\n\r\ngood  opportunity to show to the world that small  states\r\n\r\ncan make significant contributions to the UN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nsteps  his  Ministry is taking to ensure  that  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains involved in the UN. Are we likely to send more of\r\n\r\nour  men to peace-keeping missions around the world?  Are\r\n\r\nwe  willing to offer aid, be it economic or financial, to\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries around the world?  Will  we  play  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial role in United Nations institutions  such  as\r\n\r\nthe UNESCO and UNICEF?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these efforts would signal our maturity as a\r\n\r\ncountry and allow us to continue to play a useful role in\r\n\r\nthe  world stage.  Just because Singapore is no longer  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  the Security Council does not  mean  that  we\r\n\r\nshould let our efforts and our attention slide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Madam, I would say that Mr Sin Boon\r\n\r\nAnn  has  actually brought up the majority of the  points\r\n\r\nthat  I  was  thinking of.

Our\r\n\r\ninterests  are quite evident, but I am wondering  whether\r\n\r\nwe can be a part of the multilateral process, overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Madam, what I wanted to\r\n\r\nsay on the question of Iraq has actually been answered by\r\n\r\nProf.  Jayakumar quite eloquently.

Because Singapore has played a very important\r\n\r\nrole   in  terms  of its contributions and  influence  in\r\n\r\nmatters pertaining to the United Nations, Law of the  Sea\r\n\r\nConference and the World Environment Summit.   What  will\r\n\r\nMFA do to ensure that our credibility and standing in the\r\n\r\neyes  of the world remain, especially when we face issues\r\n\r\nlike Palestine and Iraq?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Madam, because of our\r\n\r\nposition, I think, increasingly, Singapore will be  asked\r\n\r\nto  perform  a  wider role in the community  of  nations.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, I think we will be called upon  to  provide\r\n\r\nfinancial  aid  or  other forms  of  assistance  to  less\r\n\r\ndeveloped   countries.   Indeed,   for   many   developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  has\r\n\r\nbecome a strategic tool in order to generate goodwill and\r\n\r\nbuild  allies   -   important  bridges  in  international\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.  But we are not in the league of the big  OECD\r\n\r\ncountries when it comes to foreign aid, and our resources\r\n\r\nare finite.  We should, first and foremost, be focused on\r\n\r\ndeveloping   our  own  resources  for  our  own   people.\r\n\r\nHowever,  having a clear idea of our stand on this  issue\r\n\r\nand where we are heading is, I believe, useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nthe following questions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what is our foreign aid policy and how\r\n\r\neffective  have we been?  I define \"foreign aid\"  broadly\r\n\r\nto  include both direct and indirect aid, such as medical\r\n\r\nsupplies, technical expertise, resources general to civic\r\n\r\norganisations, as well as programmes which are  sponsored\r\n\r\nand  run  in  Singapore to help other  countries  develop\r\n\r\ntheir expertise or manpower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how much aid have we provided in the past,\r\n\r\nto which countries and for what purposes?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nthere are any plans to provide aid to the Iraqi people in\r\n\r\nthe  event that a war breaks out.  We will pray very hard\r\n\r\nthat this does not happen but, if it does, then I believe\r\n\r\nthat  we  can help to lessen the sufferings of the  Iraqi\r\n\r\npeople  by  joining  the  UN or other  international  aid\r\n\r\nagencies in their humanitarian efforts to help the people\r\n\r\nand to rebuild Iraq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Raymond Lim, you have seven\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat):</b> Madam, I shall be brief, not\r\n\r\nbecause brevity is necessarily the soul of wit, but  when\r\n\r\nyou  are  the  tail-end speaker for your  Ministry,  time\r\n\r\ntends to be compressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the questions of Mr Sin and Dr\r\n\r\nLee.  The answer is yes.  There is indeed life after  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council.  The Security Council, arguably, is the\r\n\r\nmost  important body in the UN, but many issues that  are\r\n\r\nof  interest to member states are actually taken  outside\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security  Council, in the General  Assembly  and\r\n\r\nother specialised bodies of the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always actively participated in the\r\n\r\nUN,  even before we were in the Security Council, and  we\r\n\r\nintend  to continue to do so.  We do not intend  to  fade\r\n\r\naway.   In the last four years, for instance, even before\r\n\r\nwe   entered  the  UN  Security  Council,  Singapore  had\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  a  series  of  UN  summits  and   world\r\n\r\nconferences on many different issues - issues as  diverse\r\n\r\nas  women,  children, HIV, AIDS and, more recently,  last\r\n\r\nyear, on sustainable development.  We will continue to do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee asked about our engagement with other\r\n\r\ninternational organisations, like the International Civil\r\n\r\nAviation  Organisation (ICAO).  In the case of  ICAO,  we\r\n\r\nhave sought to be elected to its governing council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On how do we support the peaceful settlement of\r\n\r\ndisputes, I think the best way to do that is by  example.\r\n\r\nA good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexample  is  on  the question of Pedra Branca.   We  have\r\n\r\ntaken   the  initiative  to  refer  the  matter  to   the\r\n\r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainul asked how do we maintain credibility in\r\n\r\nthe international community.  I think we will continue to\r\n\r\ndo  what we have always done, and that is, we have always\r\n\r\ntaken  the approach where we are guided by principles  of\r\n\r\ninternational law, by compliance with the United  Nations\r\n\r\nCharter   and  the  United  Nations  Security   Council's\r\n\r\nresolutions.   I  think  it  is  perhaps  reflecting  our\r\n\r\nconsistent  and  principled approach  that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously in the international community.   It  is\r\n\r\nreally out of proportion to our size.  And perhaps  again\r\n\r\nreflecting   this,   Singapore  is   increasingly   being\r\n\r\nrepresented in international bodies.  In the UN, we  have\r\n\r\nUnder  Secretary  Dilip Nair who heads  the  UN  Internal\r\n\r\nAudit  Office and Miss Noeleen Heyzer, the well-respected\r\n\r\nHead of the UN Development Fund for Women.  We now have a\r\n\r\ncandidate,  Mrs  Anamah Tan, for  the  Committee  on  the\r\n\r\nElimination of Discrimination Against Women,  the  treaty\r\n\r\nbody that oversees compliance with the Convention on  the\r\n\r\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,\r\n\r\nto  which  Singapore is a party.  This is  a  prestigious\r\n\r\nbody  and seats are hotly contested.  If we win, it  will\r\n\r\nboost our standing at the United Nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah asked three questions. First, what is\r\n\r\nour  policy on foreign aid?  Like her, I share  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  should play an active  part  in  helping\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries.  She will be pleased to  know  that\r\n\r\nwe have done so under the Singapore Cooperation Programme\r\n\r\n(SCP), which Dr Warren Lee mentioned earlier.  But unlike\r\n\r\ntraditional donor aid programmes, Singapore believes that\r\n\r\nit  can  best contribute by helping developing  countries\r\n\r\nbuild up its human resource and organisational capacities\r\n\r\nthat are critical to sustain growth.  Since its inception\r\n\r\nin 1992, over 23,000 participants from 150 countries have\r\n\r\nparticipated  in  short-term training courses  and  study\r\n\r\nvisits  under  the SCP.  While the main beneficiaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  SCP  have  been  ASEAN countries,  our  geographical\r\n\r\noutreach has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextended   to  developing  countries  in  Africa,   Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica, Middle East, South Pacific and the Caribbean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked what is the figure that we have\r\n\r\ncontributed.   Just  to  give a sense  of  it,  in  2001,\r\n\r\nSingapore  contributed $260 million towards international\r\n\r\ndevelopment assistance.  If we use certain benchmark, for\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  median  official  development  assistance\r\n\r\n(ODA), for the OECD countries, is 0.31% of gross national\r\n\r\nincome.   Singapore's figure comes up  to  0.17%  of  our\r\n\r\ngross national income.  This compares favourably with the\r\n\r\nUnited States, which is 0.11%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her last question: would we provide humanitarian aid\r\n\r\nto Iraq if there is a war?  The answer is yes.  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  likely  to contribute in the same way as we  did  for\r\n\r\nAfghanistan  in  the  form  of technical  assistance  and\r\n\r\nhumanitarian aid.  I think what is important here is how,\r\n\r\nas  a community, Government and the people, we respond to\r\n\r\nsufferings  elsewhere.  And I think Singapore  has  shown\r\n\r\nthrough  our  spontaneous help in the case of Afghanistan\r\n\r\nand  Bali that we have a heart.  I am sure that if  there\r\n\r\nis  a  war  in Iraq, the same humanitarian hand  will  be\r\n\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Madam, I want to thank the\r\n\r\nMinisters  for  their very comprehensive and  interesting\r\n\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Item 2, Dr Tan Cheng Bock is not\r\n\r\nmoving.

Its opening has been\r\n\r\nanxiously  expected by many residents in the North  East,\r\n\r\nwho  will be likely users of the line.  However, they are\r\n\r\nquite  anxious  about the cost of  the  fares.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  explain  why the fare structure  has  not  been\r\n\r\nannounced up to now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary indications are that the fares will be\r\n\r\nhigher  than the SMRT lines.   The rationale  for  having\r\n\r\nsuch  a  different fare structure is that the North  East\r\n\r\nLine,   supposedly,   has   a  higher   operating   cost.\r\n\r\nNaturally, as the line is new and the traffic build-up is\r\n\r\nnot fully completed, there will be a higher per passenger\r\n\r\noperational  cost.  On the contrary, the  SMRT  lines   - East  West  and North South lines  -  have  already  been\r\n\r\nrunning  for 14 years, and traffic and development  build\r\n\r\nup  along  the  lines have been stabilised.   The  strong\r\n\r\nargument,  I  believe, for having a uniform structure  of\r\n\r\nfares, even though there are two operators, is that  both\r\n\r\nlines feed into each other and form an integrated system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original investor of the system is the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  serving the people's needs.  It  is  not  as\r\n\r\nthough the lines are owned by different investors looking\r\n\r\nto  maximise their own different returns.  The North East\r\n\r\nLine is as  much a part of the integrated existing lines,\r\n\r\njust  as the North South Line is integrated with the East\r\n\r\nWest Line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a uniform fare structure does not yield the\r\n\r\nneeded  rates of return in spite of efficiency  criteria,\r\n\r\nthen  some  way of compensation, through feeder  rebates,\r\n\r\ncan  be  devised.   If  we do not do  this,  then  it  is\r\n\r\npatently unfair to the residents of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth East region to pay for the operation of the line  - efficient and built at a huge cost by the Government with\r\n\r\nthe state-of-the-art equipment, which perhaps they do not\r\n\r\nneed, if given a choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to raise is with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  safety  features of the North East Line  system.   I\r\n\r\nraised this point last year and I want to raise it again.\r\n\r\nCould  the Minister assure the House that safety features\r\n\r\nfor this driverless train system will be quite thoroughly\r\n\r\nlooked  into, especially with the supplier of the control\r\n\r\nsystem  as  well  as the rolling stock?  Given  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat, in recent months, there have been quite a number of\r\n\r\naccidents,  we  would like to assure the members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  that  such  a  driverless train  system  will  be\r\n\r\nthoroughly safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Madam, some people say that an\r\n\r\nMRT  station is an MRT station.  But when I  was  at  the\r\n\r\nHougang  MRT North East Line station last month  for  the\r\n\r\nofficial opening of the civil defence shelter, I  saw  an\r\n\r\nMRT station with a difference.  There was a huge art work\r\n\r\nby  our  Singapore artists, decorating the walls and  the\r\n\r\nopen  space  of  the station.  I told  myself,  \"This  is\r\n\r\nreally  arts  everywhere\",  and  it  is  wonderful.   LTA\r\n\r\ndeserves  to be congratulated for doing such an excellent\r\n\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that similar specially presented art\r\n\r\nworks  are found at every station at the North East Line.\r\n\r\nThis  is  great.  By doing so, LTA is not only   able  to\r\n\r\ncreate  the  right  ambience  for  the  station,  project\r\n\r\ndistinct identity for each station, it also showcases the\r\n\r\nworks   of   our  local  artists.   What  is  even   more\r\n\r\ninteresting  is  that  the  art works  were  incorporated\r\n\r\nduring the construction stage.  And by doing so, the  LTA\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  do it at a much lower cost.  I am  sure  the\r\n\r\npublic would appreciate it, provided that it would not be\r\n\r\ncharged to their fare, as emphasised by Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that such art works would have\r\n\r\ntherapeutic value to the tired bodies and stressed  minds\r\n\r\nof  commuters  taking  our trains  when  they  reach  the\r\n\r\nstation to return home.  My question is: will this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso  be a new feature for the Circle Line stations which\r\n\r\nare  still  under  construction?   I  ask  this  question\r\n\r\nbecause  with the budget reduction exercise  carried  out\r\n\r\nnow,  many would think that the Circle Line does not have\r\n\r\nto  have what the North East Line has.  The arts and  the\r\n\r\naesthetics  aspect of the Circle Line may be  sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIf  this happens, it is really sad because if it  is  not\r\n\r\nincorporated at the construction stage, it would be  very\r\n\r\ncostly to have it later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Madam, the 2002 Labour Market\r\n\r\nReport  released on Friday showed that for the  whole  of\r\n\r\n2002,  overall  unemployment rate in  Singapore  averaged\r\n\r\n4.4%.   Translated into numbers, almost 90,000  residents\r\n\r\nwere  unemployed.   Yet, when we  tried  to  match  these\r\n\r\nunemployed  workers  to  jobs, one  of  the  most  common\r\n\r\nreasons cited by them is \"too far\".  So, are they  fussy?\r\n\r\nOr do workers really face transportation problems getting\r\n\r\nto work?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that companies in inaccessible industrial\r\n\r\nestates, such as Tuas, have difficulties finding workers.\r\n\r\nMadam, it takes almost one hour for a worker who stays in\r\n\r\nthe  nearest housing estate to Tuas, ie, Jurong East,  to\r\n\r\nget  to  the Tuas Industrial Park.  So, you will see  how\r\n\r\ndifficult  it  is.   Another  example  is  the  shipyard.\r\n\r\nHence, these companies have resorted to providing private\r\n\r\nbuses  for  their workers.  This adds to business  costs.\r\n\r\nEven  in the instances where the workers bear the  costs,\r\n\r\nthe  private  bus  fares are generally  higher  than  the\r\n\r\npublic transport options.  This will reduce the take-home\r\n\r\npay for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, I would like to make some\r\n\r\nsuggestions for the Minister to consider:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I hope the Ministry consider extending and\r\n\r\nexpanding the MRT network into industrial estates such as\r\n\r\nTuas.  This will shorten the travelling time for workers,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  make them more willing to take  up  jobs  in\r\n\r\nthese areas.  This will also give companies there a boost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand help address the issue of our unemployment situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, would the Ministry also consider building\r\n\r\nadditional stations along the existing MRT network  where\r\n\r\nit  passes by industrial estates?  This was proven to  be\r\n\r\ndoable  with the Dover station added on to the East  West\r\n\r\nLine or Singapore Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</b> Madam, I have three\r\n\r\npoints regarding the public bus system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Public Transport Council (PTC), in\r\n\r\nreleasing  its  Bus  Service  Audit  in  September  2002,\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that there were bus services with  problems\r\n\r\nof overloading and long headways.  The PTC said that this\r\n\r\nwas    unsatisfactory   and   reflected    the    general\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction of commuters in these performance aspects\r\n\r\nand  recognised the need to reduce overcrowding and  long\r\n\r\nwaiting times on some services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote from the report:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We recognise that some existing standards are based\r\n\r\non figures averaged over the survey period, which may not\r\n\r\naccurately  reflect the performance of bus services  from\r\n\r\nthe passengers' viewpoint. Some standards also tend to be\r\n\r\nover prescriptive.  For this reason, the PTC is currently\r\n\r\nreviewing  the  standards with a view  to  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nservice  standards are relevant and closely  reflect  the\r\n\r\npublic's    expectation   for   service    quality    and\r\n\r\naffordability.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That report and its acknowledgement of the\r\n\r\nshortcomings  are an encouraging start.  May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  since  the  publication of  the  report,  what\r\n\r\nprogress has been made in reviewing the standards?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to a report in the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes of 28th February 2003 that LTA had decided to  drop\r\n\r\na  $40.3  million  plan  to provide  commuters  with  bus\r\n\r\narrival  times  via information panels at bus  stops  and\r\n\r\ninterchanges  and over the Internet, just  months  before\r\n\r\nthe project was to have been completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why the project was\r\n\r\naborted at such a late stage and how much had been  spent\r\n\r\non the project before it was aborted?  Why was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe feasibility study on the software and integration not\r\n\r\nconducted  fully  before embarking on such  a  high  cost\r\n\r\nproject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to feeder bus services. The\r\n\r\nPTC's  rules  on door width and platform height  make  it\r\n\r\nvery capital expensive for bus companies, other than  SBS\r\n\r\nTransit and TIBS, to offer feeder bus services.  Now with\r\n\r\nthe  merger of Comfort bus and SBS Transit, in the medium\r\n\r\nterm,  I  do not think there is any other bus company  in\r\n\r\nSingapore that is able or prepared to offer comprehensive\r\n\r\ncommuter feeder bus services for a housing estate.  Other\r\n\r\nrules,  like  not  allowing pick-up  of  passengers  from\r\n\r\npublic  bus stops, serve to protect the incumbent  public\r\n\r\nbus operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being the case, if the incumbent operator is\r\n\r\nnot  willing  to  improve its services for  a  particular\r\n\r\narea, the alternative would be to consider niche services\r\n\r\ndedicated  to  meet  a particular need  of  residents  to\r\n\r\ntravel   from  one  area  to  another  not  directly   or\r\n\r\nadequately served by the existing services.  For example,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  taking  public buses and  having  to  change\r\n\r\nbuses,  residents in a certain precinct may need  and  be\r\n\r\nwilling  to pay for a direct service to a particular  wet\r\n\r\nmarket.    Operators   and   the  supporting   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations will have to be creative to  come  up  with\r\n\r\nvarious service schemes to meet residents' demand.  And I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Ministry  of Transport and  the  PTC  will  be\r\n\r\nunderstanding  and  allow  such  niche  solutions  to  be\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> Madam, can I take the two cuts\r\n\r\ntogether?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</b> The cost of transportation is\r\n\r\nnever  far  from  the forefront of many  people's  minds.\r\n\r\nWhile there is widespread appreciation of the quality  of\r\n\r\nour   system  and  widespread  acknowledgement  that  the\r\n\r\ninvestments in public transportation infrastructure, like\r\n\r\nroads and rail, have made travelling about for both  work\r\n\r\nand play so much more pleasurable,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  must,  however, continue to focus on cost.   Bus  and\r\n\r\nrail  operators are contracted by the authorities to  run\r\n\r\nthe  services.   The  learning on the frontlines  by  the\r\n\r\noperators  would no doubt reveal more efficient  ways  to\r\n\r\nprovide the quality service that we all so desire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Minister to consider having regular\r\n\r\nreviews between the authorities and operators so that the\r\n\r\nlicensed  operation  conditions  have  the  fora  to   be\r\n\r\ncontinuously adjusted to reflect changing conditions, and\r\n\r\nincorporate  such learning experience.  Stipulations  and\r\n\r\nconditions  that  are  proven  over  time  to  be  overly\r\n\r\nstringent  -  kiasu  would be another characterisation  - must  be  gradually relaxed, finding a  new  balance  and\r\n\r\nequilibrium  among  the  factors  of  quality,  cost  and\r\n\r\nsafety.   Such  a partnership between the  authority  and\r\n\r\ntransport operators would, I think, lead to an even  more\r\n\r\ncost-effective transport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the issue of fare transfer\r\n\r\nrebates.  It is my understanding that we have adopted  an\r\n\r\nadministratively efficient system of fare rebates between\r\n\r\nthe  bus and rail operations with a transfer rebate  paid\r\n\r\nfrom  the operator of the first mode of transport to  the\r\n\r\noperator  of  the  follow-on  mode.   This  transfer   is\r\n\r\ntransparent to the travelling public.  Now that there are\r\n\r\nmultiple  rail and bus operators, it may be  timely  that\r\n\r\nthe transfer rebate mechanism be re-examined to assess if\r\n\r\nit  still  provides  adequate equity; and,  secondly,  to\r\n\r\naddress the transfer pricing so that people plying solely\r\n\r\non the shorter feeder services do not end up paying more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister to consider that in fare\r\n\r\npricing,  adequate attention be given such  that  pricing\r\n\r\nshould not only consider full cost recovery but it should\r\n\r\nalso  be  complemented  with measures  to  drive  maximum\r\n\r\nutilisation of the system, especially with new  additions\r\n\r\nlike  the  North  East  Line.  This  may  accelerate  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the  new  towns  and  give  a  boost  to\r\n\r\nbusinesses there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Steve Chia is not here.

During  those  times,  rainy  days  or  holiday\r\n\r\nseasons,   the   demand  for  taxis  far  outstrips   the\r\n\r\navailability  by a factor of perhaps two to three  times.\r\n\r\nIs  it  any  surprise that the customers are disappointed\r\n\r\nand  that they write about it in the press and berate the\r\n\r\nquality of our taxi service here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem has nothing to do, I believe, with the\r\n\r\nquality of taxi service or the cost of taxi fares  -  too\r\n\r\ncheap  or too expensive, as some argued.  It has  nothing\r\n\r\nto  do  with what some people have argued that taxi fares\r\n\r\nin  Singapore are too cheap compared to other  countries.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is argued, by making it higher,  it  will\r\n\r\nsolve  the  problem.  I think it has to do with  devising\r\n\r\nmicro-management tools to incentivise delivery of  output\r\n\r\nat  those  windows of demand.  It has to do with tweaking\r\n\r\nthe system presently to generate relativity of return  by\r\n\r\nprice  and by routes to incentivise the drivers of  taxis\r\n\r\nto position themselves to get better relative returns, in\r\n\r\norder  to  answer  to  those  special  local  demands  at\r\n\r\nshopping  malls or during those special times like  rainy\r\n\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the current system as it is and monitoring\r\n\r\nthe  performance of taxis as it is, based on a high level\r\n\r\nor  macro  level  approach, as under the present  system,\r\n\r\nwill  not deliver the results.  Only the LTA can  provide\r\n\r\nthe  regulatory  tweaks to produce the desired  outcomes.\r\n\r\nMy  question  is: why does the LTA not  want  to  do  it?\r\n\r\nBecause  of our unique CBD with ERP toll system,  traffic\r\n\r\nwithin the city limit is quite unique and has its own set\r\n\r\nof  fees and charges.  The rules which the LTA should set\r\n\r\nmust   overcome  the  current  price  barriers  and   yet\r\n\r\nincentivise the delivery.  Leaving it as it is or raising\r\n\r\ntaxi  fares  without incentivising relativity  of  return\r\n\r\nwill not serve the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Madam, I have three cuts on taxi\r\n\r\nservice.   Since I do not think I have time to cover  all\r\n\r\nthree, I shall just cover the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first cut relates to the quality of our taxi\r\n\r\nservices.    Recently,  under  the  new  taxi   licensing\r\n\r\nframework,  the  Land Transport Authority introduced  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  service (or QOS) standards for  taxis.   The\r\n\r\nfirst five of a total of eight service qualities touch on\r\n\r\nphone  booking.  I am puzzled as to why phone booking  is\r\n\r\nso  crucial  that  all  taxi  companies  must  have  this\r\n\r\nfacility.   Is  this  so  basic a  service  that  a  taxi\r\n\r\noperator  cannot  offer a good taxi service  without  it?\r\n\r\nUsing  an  analogy  from  the  airline  industry,  it  is\r\n\r\ntantamount to requiring all new players wanting to set up\r\n\r\na  new  airline to offer in-flight services of  the  same\r\n\r\nquality as Singapore Airlines with video-on-demand on all\r\n\r\nclasses,   wonderful   meal   choices,   on-line   ticket\r\n\r\nreservation  and  all.   In the US,  some  airlines  have\r\n\r\nrecently introduced low cost services catering to  budget\r\n\r\nconscious travellers, where one has to pay for  meals  on\r\n\r\nboard,  refreshments and the audio headset.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  there  may be other airlines that  want  to  offer\r\n\r\npremium service to distinguish themselves and cater to  a\r\n\r\ndifferent segment of the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why should we not allow someone to set up a no-frills taxi service without having to invest in costly\r\n\r\ncall  centre and despatch facilities to manage  telephone\r\n\r\nbooking?   After  all, a key objective of  the  licensing\r\n\r\nframework  must  be to meet the needs  of  the  commuting\r\n\r\npublic.   Competition  is supposed to  bring  about  more\r\n\r\nchoices and cut cost.  If someone sees the long queues at\r\n\r\ntaxi stands, and the dissatisfied commuters waiting along\r\n\r\nthe roadsides, and thinks there is a commuter demand, why\r\n\r\ncan  he  not  be allowed to set up a taxi operation  just\r\n\r\ncatering to this demand, without having to set up a  call\r\n\r\ncentre to manage phone booking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official answer seems to be that to allow\r\n\r\nsomeone  to  come  in without such requirements  will  be\r\n\r\nunfair  to  the incumbent who has invested  in  all  this\r\n\r\nexpensive  equipment.   But why  must  all  newcomers  be\r\n\r\nlocked in to a less than ideal business model?  The rules\r\n\r\nshould be more flexible.  The phone booking qualities  of\r\n\r\nservice should only apply to the taxi operator who offers\r\n\r\nphone booking service as part of its overall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness  strategy.  The rules should be flexible  enough\r\n\r\nto  provide the taxi operator with the option of deciding\r\n\r\nwhether to provide such a facility for its customers.  If\r\n\r\nan  operator  believes that he can provide the  essential\r\n\r\ntaxi  service  to  meet  the demands  of  our  commuters,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding not having phone booking, why not let the\r\n\r\ncommuters  decide?   Essentially,  competition  is  about\r\n\r\nletting the market decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, may I move on to my next cut relating to taxi\r\n\r\nfares and pricing mechanism?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is almost 6.30 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Okay.

Very  few\r\n\r\nresidents have cited unaffordability as a reason for  not\r\n\r\nbeing  in  favour of LUP.  This is because the Government\r\n\r\nsubsidises  between 75% and 90% of the cost of  the  LUP,\r\n\r\nand  the  remainder is co-shared by the resident and  the\r\n\r\nTown  Council.  The share per household ranges from  $600\r\n\r\nto  $3,000, with most households paying $1,000  or  less.\r\n\r\nIn  addition,  HDB extends financial assistance  measures\r\n\r\nsuch  as extension of the repayment period, to households\r\n\r\nwho may have difficulty in paying for the LUP costs.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
