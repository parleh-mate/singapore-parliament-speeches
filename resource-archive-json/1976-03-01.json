Sir, as in previous years. Haj pilgrims made  private\r\n\r\narrangements with travel agents to proceed to Mecca by air. It\r\n\r\ncame  to  the  notice of the Ministry a few  days  before  the\r\n\r\nscheduled  departure of two groups of Haj  pilgrims  that  the\r\n\r\npilgrimage  flights  for the 9th and 10th  November  would  be\r\n\r\ndelayed  due  to  the  non-availability  of  the  planes.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  immediately initiated investigations. It  was  found\r\n\r\nthat the two travel agents who were responsible for these  two\r\n\r\ngroups  of  pilgrims, together with other parties  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  chartering  and providing the planes, had mishandled  the\r\n\r\nflight  arrangements.  In  view  of  the  circumstances,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  intervened and, with the assistance of the Singapore\r\n\r\nInternational  Airlines, arranged a number of SIA  flights  to\r\n\r\ntransport  all  the  pilgrims to Jeddah  in  time  to  perform\r\n\r\npilgrimage.

The transfer fee then was $100  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst  acre  and $50 for every additional acre or part  of  an\r\n\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a transfer fee is designed to discourage\r\n\r\nfrequent  transfers  of such holdings and the  abuses  arising\r\n\r\ntherefrom.  It is not unusual for large sums of  money  to  be\r\n\r\npaid  as  consideration between licensees and  purchasers  for\r\n\r\ntransfers of such holdings. The highest amount ascertained  by\r\n\r\nthe  Land Office was $15,000 per acre for an area of 2.2 acres\r\n\r\nof land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 there were 330 applications. In 1974, the number was 439.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter too frequent applications and to prevent\r\n\r\nspeculation, the transfer fee was revised in October  1974  to\r\n\r\n$200 for the first acre and $100 for every additional acre. In\r\n\r\naddition,  on approval, the Temporary Occupation Licence  fees\r\n\r\nwere revised. For holdings in the rural areas, the revised fee\r\n\r\nis  $72  per  acre  per annum. That these  increases  are  not\r\n\r\nexcessive  is  borne  out by the fact  that  applications  for\r\n\r\ntransfers increased from 439 in 1974 to 552 in 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer fee of $500 quoted by the Member for Jalan Kayu\r\n\r\nrefers  to one particular farm lot with an area of about  four\r\n\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current practice, the transfer fee may be waived\r\n\r\nand  the  old  rates  of  Temporary  Occupation  Licence  fees\r\n\r\nretained, at the discretion of the Licences Committee where it\r\n\r\nis  ascertained that hardship will be caused to  the  next-of-kin, especially those in receipt of public assistance from the\r\n\r\nSocial Welfare Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the Member for Jalan Kayu's representations,\r\n\r\nI  have  directed the Commissioner of Lands and  the  Licences\r\n\r\nCommittee to liberally allow waiver of transfer fees  as  well\r\n\r\nas  retention of the old rates of Temporary Occupation Licence\r\n\r\nfees,  where  investigations reveal that the circumstances  of\r\n\r\nany particular case so warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, on the face of it, it\r\n\r\nsounds very good.

The Select  Committee\r\n\r\nreceived nine representations and heard oral evidence from all\r\n\r\nthe  representors. Some of the contributions were valuable and\r\n\r\na  number  of  suggestions  have  been  accepted.  The  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee's Report was published and presented to  this  House\r\n\r\non 16th February, 1976, as Paper Parl. 1 of 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, as now tabled before the House, incorporates\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  which  have been recommended  by  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.

The  maximum punishment for contravention is a fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $1,000. It was brought to the Committee's attention\r\n\r\nthat  life  in  a multistorey building would be unbearable  if\r\n\r\nthere  were persistent violations of these by-laws which  were\r\n\r\nenacted to ensure the comfort and well-being of the occupants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also decided to add a new provision in the Bill\r\n\r\nto exempt an instrument of transfer lodged pursuant to the new\r\n\r\nsection 32B, 32C or 32D from payment of stamp duty. This  will\r\n\r\nlessen  some of the financial burdens which a developer  would\r\n\r\nhave  to bear when he makes a transfer of the interest in  the\r\n\r\nland  on  which  flats have been built to the  owners  of  the\r\n\r\nflats. In all such cases the value of the developer's interest\r\n\r\nin the land is nominal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 has been amended to empower the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nBuildings   to  have  more  effective  powers  to  deal   with\r\n\r\nmanagement  corporations which are not  run  properly  and  to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Minister to make regulations  to  prescribe  the\r\n\r\ncomposition of the management council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also decided to add a new provision to prohibit\r\n\r\ndevelopers  from  levying  maintenance  charges  without   the\r\n\r\napproval  of the Commissioner of Buildings from the  time  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  is  completed  until such  time  as  the  management\r\n\r\ncorporation  takes over the maintenance of the building.  This\r\n\r\nwould prevent any attempt to impose excessive charges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members are aware that in many high-rise buildings there\r\n\r\nare  multi-storey car parks. In all these buildings which have\r\n\r\nbeen  completed before the introduction of the Bill, the  car\r\n\r\nparks are owned and controlled by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  developers  who, at the time of the sale of  the  housing\r\n\r\nunits  in the building, did not pass on the construction costs\r\n\r\nof  the  car  parks  to  the purchasers.

But it may be helpful\r\n\r\nto   Members  if  I  touch  on  selected  topics  of\r\n\r\nrelevance for\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore's Economy in 1975</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1975 was a year of world-wide recession with the\r\n\r\nmajor  OECD  countries suffering on  the  average  a\r\n\r\ndecline  in  growth  of 2'/4%. In the  circumstances\r\n\r\nSingapore's real growth of 4.1% may be considered  a\r\n\r\nfair   performance,  though  it   is   disappointing\r\n\r\ncompared  with the double digit rates of  the  early\r\n\r\nSeventies. At current prices, the growth  was  9.0%.\r\n\r\nThe  difference of about 5% between the  two  rates,\r\n\r\nthe  GNP  deflator,  reflects the relatively  stable\r\n\r\nprices  in  1975. This is welcome relief  after  the\r\n\r\nsteep price increases of 1974. On the other hand, it\r\n\r\ncould be also a measure of sluggish demand in 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recession, the worst since the Great\r\n\r\nDepression,  grew more serious in all industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries for the first half of the year.  Our  open\r\n\r\neconomy  registered  this decline.  The  diversified\r\n\r\nnature  of our markets and products which had  stood\r\n\r\nus   in   good   stead   against  adverse   external\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in other years, in this instance,  was\r\n\r\nnot able to counter a simultaneous decline of almost\r\n\r\nall  economies  of  the  industrial  countries.  And\r\n\r\nfurther the loss of the markets in Vietnam, Cambodia\r\n\r\nand  Laos  did  not  help. The  severest  effect  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economy was a decline in  manufacturing\r\n\r\noutput,  which  was counterbalanced,  to  a  limited\r\n\r\nextent, by a stimulation of growth in the  services\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately by mid-i 975, economic recovery was\r\n\r\nspearheaded by the United States. This recovery  was\r\n\r\nfollowed, somewhat hesitantly, by Japan and West\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGermany.  The advances in industrial production  and\r\n\r\nincreases  in imports reflected the turn  around  of\r\n\r\nactivities to meet increased demand. However, it was\r\n\r\nlargely   through   the  build-up  of   inventories.\r\n\r\nConsumer spending, the driving force behind  earlier\r\n\r\nrecoveries of the 1960's, was relatively  weak.  New\r\n\r\nlong term fixed investment was also weak. There  was\r\n\r\nexcess  productive  capacity in  all  industrialised\r\n\r\neconomies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Prospects for 1976</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest OECD reports forecast growth in the\r\n\r\nmajor  industrialised countries at  4'A%  for  1976,\r\n\r\nnearly  the  rate  in  the  second  half  of   1975.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, increase  in  volume  of  world   trade\r\n\r\n(exports  and  imports) in 1976 is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nabout 6%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these forecasts are realised (and we have been\r\n\r\ndisappointed  before), they will stimulate  our  own\r\n\r\neconomic  revival.  A word of caution  is, however,\r\n\r\nnecessary.  Not all industries will benefit  to  the\r\n\r\nsame extent. There may be special, or local, factors\r\n\r\nwhich  affect  particular industries.  For  example.\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  appearance of new or  more  direct\r\n\r\nsources  of  supply to their established markets  in\r\n\r\nJapan,  Hong Kong or Vietnam, the petroleum refining\r\n\r\nindustry  may  suffer still from a lack  of  demand.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the glut in tankers and larger ships  has\r\n\r\nled  to small new orders. Japanese shipbuilders  are\r\n\r\ndiversifying their activities. Our ship and oil  rig\r\n\r\nbuilding  and  repair  industries  are  feeling  the\r\n\r\nincreasing  pressure  of their  fierce  competition.\r\n\r\nPetroleum    refining   and   transport    equipment\r\n\r\nindustries   are   our  two  largest   manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustries.  They made big contributions  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears  to  growth  of our GDP.  In  1976  we  cannot\r\n\r\nexpect,  for several years, a return to the  era  of\r\n\r\nrapid expansion, in a period of high oil prices  and\r\n\r\nenergy conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Economic Policy for 1976</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What remedies can we prescribe for our economic\r\n\r\nills  in  1976?  The answer must be  the  tried  and\r\n\r\ntested  mixtures. In the last two years of recession\r\n\r\nwe  have, nevertheless, pursued policies which  will\r\n\r\nresult in relatively\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigh  rates of growth. These policies have yet to yield  their\r\n\r\nfull  results. With increasingly difficult economic  problems.\r\n\r\nthe  Government will have to play a greater role  in  ensuring\r\n\r\norderly  economic  development,  in  stimulating  the  economy\r\n\r\nwithout  rekindling  another bout  of  inflation.  The  public\r\n\r\nsector  will continue to provide the necessary facilities  and\r\n\r\nservices necessary to sustain growth. The private sector  must\r\n\r\nredouble   its   efforts   in  increasing   and   diversifying\r\n\r\nproduction, and in securing new markets. It may be  useful  to\r\n\r\nreview existing Government measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Industrial Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy for industrial development remains the\r\n\r\ndiversification,  restructuring  and  modernisation   of   our\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry.  We must get  higher  technology  and\r\n\r\nskill-intensive  industries  to  set  up  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board has deployed its senior  staff  in\r\n\r\nthe  field.  Their  effectiveness has resulted  in  investment\r\n\r\ncommitments  for  1975  of  $400  million  despite  world-wide\r\n\r\nrecession.  This  amount  is less  than  commitments  of  $822\r\n\r\nmillion for 1974 and $944 million for 1973.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the difficult economic conditions of last year,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  really complain. With excess industrial production\r\n\r\ncapacity   and   high   unemployment  in  the   industrialised\r\n\r\ncountries,  most enterprises concentrated on their  home-based\r\n\r\nproduction.  Greater effort is necessary  to  achieve  results\r\n\r\ncomparable to the early 1970's, before the oil crisis. The EDB\r\n\r\nHead  Office  will  be  strengthened  to  help  investors  get\r\n\r\nproduction started expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our development as a services centre for technical know-how\r\n\r\nand  finance  has widened our field. Our supporting  services,\r\n\r\nincluding  comprehensive  financial  facilities,  have   often\r\n\r\nsettled  hesitations  in  new  investments.  The  Jurong  Town\r\n\r\nCorporation  (JTC)  has now an adequate supply  of  industrial\r\n\r\nland  and  factories  with  all  utility  services  ready  for\r\n\r\nallocation.  JTC  took  the slack of the  last  two  years  to\r\n\r\nprepare for renewed demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our object to get skill-intensive industries has had some\r\n\r\nsuccess.  Investment commitments in 1975 were made  mostly  in\r\n\r\ntechnically  more advanced metal engineering  industries.  The\r\n\r\nexpected  value added per worker for these new industries  has\r\n\r\nincreased to $43,000 a year, compared to $33,000 a year in the\r\n\r\nlast  few years Similar increases in expected value added also\r\n\r\nobtain  for other industrial groups, particularly in transport\r\n\r\nequipment and petroleum processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, a special fund has been\r\n\r\nset  up  for  skill-intensive industries bearing higher  risks\r\n\r\nthan  those normally acceptable to financial institutions,  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  date approved loans of $6.1 million to five projects\r\n\r\nwith  a  total fixed investment of $30.7 million. They are  in\r\n\r\nprecision  engineering  and  metal  fabrication  and  have  an\r\n\r\naverage value added per worker of $50,000, compared to $17,000\r\n\r\nfor existing industries. We get these industries through joint\r\n\r\nventures with foreign companies possessing the technical know-how.  Introduction of new skills to local enterprises  through\r\n\r\njoint  ventures  with foreign partners is promising.  Over  30\r\n\r\nprojects are now under active negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced additional tax incentive measures for\r\n\r\nindustry.  These  have been implemented. Seven  projects  with\r\n\r\ntotal fixed investments of $134 million have been approved for\r\n\r\npioneer  status,  with tax exemption periods beyond  the  five\r\n\r\nyears  allowed  previously. The Economic Activation  Committee\r\n\r\nremains  ready  to help industries over the recession  to  get\r\n\r\nindustrial production to full capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade development policy has to be adjusted to support\r\n\r\nour  other  activities, especially those in the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nand  services  sectors.  For example, we  are  paying  special\r\n\r\nattention  to  the  establishment of  enterprises  engaged  in\r\n\r\nwarehousing, servicing and maintenance of equipment. They will\r\n\r\nmeet demand for such services in Singapore and in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are increasing our trade development efforts. Our\r\n\r\nCommercial  Secretaries' Service has been expanded to  provide\r\n\r\nour  manufacturers  and  traders  with  more  information  and\r\n\r\ncontacts.  In  1975,  we sent six major missions  to  over  12\r\n\r\ncountries.  Thirty  foreign missions came to  Singapore.  More\r\n\r\nmissions will go in the coming year to follow up the  work  of\r\n\r\nearlier missions. The Export Credit Insurance Guarantee Scheme\r\n\r\nhas  been  finalised. The Export Credit Insurance Corporation,\r\n\r\nwith  an  initial paid-up capital of $30 million, will  start\r\n\r\noperation this June. The MAS facility for rediscount of export\r\n\r\nbills  provided  last  year  enabled  our  manufacturers   and\r\n\r\nexporters   to  lower  costs  of  export  and  hence   secured\r\n\r\nadditional export markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government can only facilitate the primary task\r\n\r\nof  our traders and manufacturers themselves. The Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and  the  Singapore Manufacturers' Association  must\r\n\r\nseek and identify new outlets. They must go out and sell their\r\n\r\ngoods and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may not be inappropriate if I refer here to the\r\n\r\nrecent  Conference of ASEAN Heads of Government  at  Bali.  In\r\n\r\neconomic  matters,  the Conference agreed  on  cooperation  in\r\n\r\npriority   supply  and  purchase  of  food  and   energy,   in\r\n\r\nestablishment  of agreed industrial projects, in  preferential\r\n\r\ntrading  arrangements particularly for the  products  of  such\r\n\r\nASEAN  industrial  projects,  in  stabilisation  of  commodity\r\n\r\nprices and in a unified approach by ASEAN member countries  to\r\n\r\nother countries or regional associations. Compared to advanced\r\n\r\nregional  groupings  like  the EEC, the  agreement  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\neconomic  cooperation now embodied in the Bali Declaration  is\r\n\r\nbut  a  skeletal framework. This will need time to  flesh  out\r\n\r\nwith  the  substance  of  ASEAN projects  and  other  economic\r\n\r\nmeasures.  Unlike the more ambitious resolutions of the  Group\r\n\r\nof  77 developing nations for a new world economic order,  the\r\n\r\naims  of  the ASEAN agreement are modest and should be capable\r\n\r\nof quick realisation. If we make even moderate progress in the\r\n\r\nnext few months to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  this agreement implemented, the ASEAN countries will have\r\n\r\nmoved from discussions to conclusions and from good intentions\r\n\r\nto  concrete steps for implementation, even if they are  small\r\n\r\nsteps  up  what  is a difficult road to greater  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical cooperation for the good of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures to implement the agreement reached in Bali can\r\n\r\nbe  the  first  steps  in regional self-help.  They  can  also\r\n\r\nincrease  ASEAN's  total  bargaining  strength  vis-a-vis  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  giants  of America, Japan and  the  EEC  and  with\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we implement these few limited ASEAN measures, we shall\r\n\r\ngenerate  confidence in our people and in  each  other  member\r\n\r\ncountry  in  ASEAN. We hope that economic ties  between  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmember  states  will  now  grow  as  fast  as  their  economic\r\n\r\nrelationships with the EEC. Japan and the United  States  have\r\n\r\nbeen  developing. If the mood in Bali prevails, it will be  to\r\n\r\nthe good of us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak on behalf of my colleagues and myself when I state\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Government stands ready to concede as much\r\n\r\nas it gets from the first set of measures. We cannot afford to\r\n\r\nlose the momentum generated at Bali through lack of vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My counterparts in Indonesia. Malaysia, the Philippines and\r\n\r\nThailand   and   I   have  established  a  realistic   working\r\n\r\nrelationship. Now it is up to all of us representing the  five\r\n\r\nmember  countries  and our officials to  press  ahead  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit of amity and cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Construction</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I announced that public sector construction would\r\n\r\nbe   increased.  Much  planning  and  design  for   additional\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects  were completed  in  1975,  Construction\r\n\r\nstarted  towards the middle of the year. Construction of  many\r\n\r\nprojects will continue through 1976 and beyond. Public  sector\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure  in 1975 increased  by  34%.  Largest\r\n\r\nincreases  were  in  utilities, transport  and  communication,\r\n\r\nindustrial estate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and public housing. In spite of the  construction\r\n\r\nsector's  small share of total GDP, it accounted for 20.3%  of\r\n\r\ntotal  increase of GDP in 1975. Furthermore, such construction\r\n\r\ntook place at a time of stable or declining prices. So it  had\r\n\r\nno  inflationary effects. For 1 976, both the  Government  and\r\n\r\nthe  Statutory  Boards  will press on with  their  development\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial training must be expanded. We must have enough\r\n\r\ntrained   workers  for  industries  when  they   resume   full\r\n\r\nproduction.  My  Ministry estimates that, for economic  growth\r\n\r\nrates of 7-10% in 1976 and 10-13% per year in 1977-80, we need\r\n\r\nan  average annual addition of 3.000 relevant professional and\r\n\r\ntechnical  graduates,  2.600  technicians,  and  about   7,300\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.  Our  training institutions,  secondary  and\r\n\r\ntechnical,  and tertiary, have to plan to meet these  manpower\r\n\r\nneeds,  in  types  of professional, skilled  and  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nworkers for the industries likely to be in production.  A  sum\r\n\r\nof  $23.4  million  has been approved for industrial  training\r\n\r\nconducted  by the private sector in Joint Industrial  Training\r\n\r\nCentres  and other training schemes. Disbursement is  expected\r\n\r\nto be made within the next four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent changes in the education system give it a\r\n\r\ntechnical  bias, with more facilities for industrial training.\r\n\r\nVocational  training  and the Industrial Training  Board  will\r\n\r\ninculcate  attitudes  of  care  and  precision  essential  for\r\n\r\nsuccess in climbing up the technological ladder. There will be\r\n\r\nmore  blue-collar jobs, and young Singaporeans must be trained\r\n\r\nto do them well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers already on the job, have to improve their skills and\r\n\r\nincrease  work  discipline.  Employers  should  improve  their\r\n\r\npersonnel management. Increased productivity depends  on  both\r\n\r\nworkers and employers. Management in the Statutory Boards, and\r\n\r\nin  Government, must make more optimal use of manpower through\r\n\r\nimprovement in the administrative and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagement structure. A recent analysis by my Ministry  showed\r\n\r\nthat  both the Government and Statutory Boards have  been  too\r\n\r\nlavish  in their use of professionally and technically trained\r\n\r\nmen,   This  has  to  be  reversed.  Our  policy  is  to  keep\r\n\r\nestablishment strength in the public services to a minimum  in\r\n\r\norder  that more professional and technical men can  join  the\r\n\r\nproductive private sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wages Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of more modest growth rates, and with\r\n\r\ninflation now under control, there has to be an adjustment  in\r\n\r\nour  wage  policy. Everyone will have to be prepared for  much\r\n\r\nsmaller  increases than in the years before  the  oil  crisis.\r\n\r\nThere  can be little or no increase in wages without increases\r\n\r\nin productivity. We cannot afford to blunt the competitiveness\r\n\r\nof  our exports. The past method of negotiating wage increases\r\n\r\non  top of NWC recommendations must be reviewed. Too many wage\r\n\r\nagreements  have  sought to circumvent NWC recommendations  by\r\n\r\nfringe benefits. They have included a funeral grant of  up  to\r\n\r\n$1,000  on  each  death  of a member in  the  family,  laundry\r\n\r\nallowance,  tea allowance, meal subsidy, shift duty allowance,\r\n\r\nattendance and transport allowance, savings account of  5%  in\r\n\r\naddition  to CPF employers' contribution. In toto,  these  so-called fringe benefits have a heavy impact on costs. The  time\r\n\r\nhas come for the National Wages Council to consider whether it\r\n\r\nshould  not  include  all forms of wage  increases,  including\r\n\r\nannual  increments, incentive allowances and bonuses,  in  the\r\n\r\ncomputation of the annual NWC wage supplements, to arrive at a\r\n\r\nsingle  total  annual wage increase. The present  practice  of\r\n\r\nhaving  separate increases spread throughout  the  year  under\r\n\r\ndifferent   descriptions  is  deceptive.  If  these  practices\r\n\r\ncontinue, Singapore labour will be the most expensive in  East\r\n\r\nand  South-east Asia, outside Japan. Unfortunately, we are not\r\n\r\nmore hardworking nor more sk lIed than people in Korea. Taiwan\r\n\r\nor Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Monetary Policy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our monetary policies were geared to provide more funds to\r\n\r\nstimulate productive activities. This was done whilst ensuring\r\n\r\na healthy position on balance of payments and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreserves. The freeing of bank rates last year made for a  more\r\n\r\nrapid adjustment of domestic interest rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With further expansion of the money supply in 1976, the\r\n\r\nproductive sectors should have finance at reasonable  interest\r\n\r\nrates.  Of  course,  there  will  be  suitable  safeguards  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  monetary stability, and sufficient  flexibility  for\r\n\r\nrapid  adjustments to changes in world currency  exchange  and\r\n\r\ninterest rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made major changes to liberalise our foreign\r\n\r\nexchange   controls.  Included  in  the  list  of   `scheduled\r\n\r\nterritories'  now, are all ASEAN countries.  We  have  removed\r\n\r\nrestrictions  on  the flow of currency notes  and  raised  the\r\n\r\nceiling for investment in specified currencies and securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are giving priority to the development of the forward\r\n\r\nforeign exchange market. With floating exchange rates, traders\r\n\r\nneed  a good forward market for safe and favourable cover.  We\r\n\r\nare  also  nurturing the bond and capital markets. To increase\r\n\r\ncompetitive efficiency, banks and other financial institutions\r\n\r\nhave  been encouraged, by liberalising conditions under  which\r\n\r\nthey  operate,  to  provide  more  competition  in  rates   of\r\n\r\ninterests  and  discounts.  All  Acts  and  regulations  which\r\n\r\ninhibit  such competition amongst financial institutions  will\r\n\r\nbe amended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tourism Development</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the recession, our tourist sector has continued\r\n\r\nfavourable   growth  in  1975.  Both  the  Singapore   Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation  have\r\n\r\nmore  funds  for  further tourist facilities and  attractions.\r\n\r\nTheir  effort will, doubtless, be reinforced by the activities\r\n\r\nabroad, of airlines, hoteliers and travel agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Final Remarks on Economic Policy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the world economic uncertainties and the need to\r\n\r\nshelter  our  domestic economy from adverse external  factors.\r\n\r\nour  long  term  aim  is still high rates of  economic  growth\r\n\r\nthrough  industrialisation, and through  improving  technical\r\n\r\nknow-how and services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  current upturn in the industrialised countries will  help\r\n\r\nour  economic  growth. But harder work  from  our  people  and\r\n\r\ngreater  vigilance from entrepreneurs and administrators  will\r\n\r\nbe  required  since the oil prices have gone  up  five  times.\r\n\r\nImprovement  in the quality of our workers through  education,\r\n\r\ntraining   and   retraining,  must  be   matched   by   better\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and  managers. Through continual  modernisation\r\n\r\nand   innovation,  management  must  improve  production   and\r\n\r\nadministration, financial control and personnel management and\r\n\r\nmarketing methods. Increases in productivity are the result of\r\n\r\njudicious  capital investment and good management, matched  by\r\n\r\nhigh  skills and discipline from the workers. In this  way  we\r\n\r\nshall  maintain the competitive edge of our goods and services\r\n\r\nin  the  international market against the  tough  and  spartan\r\n\r\nsocieties of Korea and Taiwan and the hard driving competition\r\n\r\nof Hong Kong. Life has always been harsher in these countries.\r\n\r\nThe  result is hardy and industrious workers capable  of  long\r\n\r\nhours of work and sustained discipline. We can pay our workers\r\n\r\nhigher  wages and have them enjoy a higher standard of  living\r\n\r\nonly  if they use our better location and more advanced social\r\n\r\nand  industrial infrastructure to advantage. Our entrepreneurs\r\n\r\nand  managers must be adequately recompensed for capital  they\r\n\r\nbring.  The  enterprise with which they use this  capital  can\r\n\r\nraise  the  sophistication in technology  and  skills  of  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  and servicing sectors of our economy.  This  is\r\n\r\nour answer to our tough and hardy competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The FY 76 Budget Estimates</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the Budget Estimates. The\r\n\r\nMain Estimates of Expenditure are a realistic forecast of  the\r\n\r\nsums  of  money  likely to be spent in the  forthcoming  year.\r\n\r\nApart    from    unusual   unforeseen   expenditure,    actual\r\n\r\ndisbursements  over the years have grown  at  a  steady  rate.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  for  FY  76,  excluding  the  allocation  to   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund, the estimated expenditure of $5,089  million\r\n\r\ncompares with $4,335 million for FY 75 and $3,381 million  for FY 74.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administration's ability to use budgetary allocations\r\n\r\neffectively depends on the civil service which must have  able\r\n\r\nadministrators,   supported   by   qualified    and    trained\r\n\r\nprofessional staff. Appendix A of the Establishment List shows\r\n\r\nthe vacancy position in the civil service at the beginning  of\r\n\r\nDecember  1975. There are big shortages of Division I officers\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministries  of Defence, Health, Foreign  Affairs  and\r\n\r\nEducation. Recruitment is progressing satisfactorily.  On  1st\r\n\r\nFebruary 1976, the overall position in Division I had  dropped\r\n\r\nto  2.414 vacancies. To meet numbers required of graduates and\r\n\r\ntrained  teachers in Education, the Universities and Institute\r\n\r\nof  Education and Junior Colleges will expand their intakes of\r\n\r\nstudents in the forthcoming year. Hence their increased budget\r\n\r\nallocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget also provides a very high proportion of total\r\n\r\nexpenditure  to Social and Community Services, almost  40%  of\r\n\r\nthe  Budget. Housing, at $854 million, is almost 1 7% of total\r\n\r\nexpenditure. Expenditure on Education will be $555 million  or\r\n\r\nnearly 11% of the total expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector of public spending is on economic\r\n\r\nservices, about 30% of total expenditure. $780 million are for\r\n\r\nindustrial  and commerical development, second largest  single\r\n\r\nitem  after Housing, 1 5.3% of the total expenditure. Of this.\r\n\r\n$338.4   million  (43.4%)  will  be  loans  to   Jurong   Town\r\n\r\nCorporation and $292.9 million (37.6%) loans to industrial and\r\n\r\ncommercial enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For transport and communications, from the FY 75 $176.5\r\n\r\nmillion vote, provision is made for $332.2 million for FY  76.\r\n\r\nan  88.2% increase. The building of Changi as a double  runway\r\n\r\ninternational  airport  takes almost $130  million  for  1976,\r\n\r\nwhilst  $60.34  million are for projects at Paya  Lebar.  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar will continue as the main airport until both runways and\r\n\r\nall facilities in Changi are ready by 1982.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tourism, $10 million for Fl' 75 is increased to $30\r\n\r\nmillion for FY 76. Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC)  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  tourist  facilities  on Sentosa  and  other  offshore\r\n\r\nislands,  to build beach bays, jetties, shelters, showers  and\r\n\r\nother recreational facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the central core of the Administration which\r\n\r\nprovides the General Services. From $160.9 million for  FY  75\r\n\r\nfor   General   and  Financial  Administration  and   Economic\r\n\r\nRegulation and Foreign Affairs, an increase of 9.7% to $1 76.5\r\n\r\nmillion for FY 76 is provided. This is a modest percentage  of\r\n\r\ntotal allocation to these support and general services. It  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  the  interests of efficiency and productivity  to  go\r\n\r\nbelow  this  figure. Indeed, the level of  efficiency  can  be\r\n\r\nraised  by  training  and personnel selection  programmes.  An\r\n\r\nEstablishment  Unit  has been set up in the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice  to  monitor the careers of all Division I officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service. This PMO Establishment Unit will seek  out\r\n\r\nhigh  calibre officers especially in the 25-40 age  group,  to\r\n\r\nfill a gap caused by many promising officers in the 30-45  age\r\n\r\ngroup  leaving the service during the years of rapid  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth,  when the government service was under the constraints\r\n\r\nof  wage  restraint  and could not compete  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Revenue</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the question of financing the proposed\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  The Treasury Memorandum (Paper Misc. 4 of 1976.) compares  the  latest\r\n\r\nrevised  revenue estimates of FY 75 with revenue collected  in\r\n\r\nFY 74. It also shows the yield we expect in FY 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue of $3,108 million for FY 76\r\n\r\nrepresents  an increase of 6.7% over the revised estimate  for\r\n\r\nFY  75.  Revenue in FY 74 was 1 5.2% more than that in FY  73.\r\n\r\nThe  revised estimate of revenue in FY 75 is 13.9%  more  than\r\n\r\nrevenue  in  FY  74. The decline in the rate  of  increase  in\r\n\r\nrevenue is inevitable. The economy slowed down in 1975.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is the largest single source of revenue. It will\r\n\r\nbe particularly affected by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecession  since collections are based on the previous  year's\r\n\r\nearnings  not those of the coming year. For FY 76, income  tax\r\n\r\nis expected to yield $1,200 million, barely 9.1% more than the\r\n\r\nrevised  estimates for FY 75. However, it is  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nabout 39% of total revenue for FY 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue estimate of $3,108 million, at existing tax\r\n\r\nrates, covers the estimated recurrent expenditure  of  $3,104\r\n\r\nmillion.  There  will  be  a small  operating  surplus  of  $4\r\n\r\nmillion.  Members should note that in the estimated  recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure  is  $625 million which goes  to  the  Development\r\n\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development expenditure of $2,610 million, 43% more than\r\n\r\nthe revised figure for FY 75, will be financed by proceeds  of\r\n\r\nnew  loans totalling $1,280 million, both domestic and foreign\r\n\r\nand  by  $625  million to be transferred from the Consolidated\r\n\r\nFund.  Investment  income  and  repayment  of  loans  made  to\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and companies in the past will also  make  up\r\n\r\ntotal  development estimates. These sources  are  expected  to\r\n\r\ncover  about  88%  of  estimated development  expenditure.  An\r\n\r\noverall  deficit  of  $309  million  can  be  met  wholly,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary, by drawing down the Development Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered a number of tax proposals. The amount of\r\n\r\nrevenue Government requires each year for recurrent as well as\r\n\r\ndevelopment   expenditure  is  increasing  rapidly.   But   to\r\n\r\nstimulate the economy it is necessary not to reduce purchasing\r\n\r\npower.  I  have  therefore decided to propose only  one  small\r\n\r\nincrease in tax amounting to about $10 million per annum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Import duty on cigarettes will rise from $38 to $43 per\r\n\r\nkilo. Excise duty will rise from $3.50 to $3.70 per kilo. Duty\r\n\r\non leaf tobacco will rise from $32 to $35 per kilo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of duty will come into effect today. We are\r\n\r\nallowing for a 8% drop in consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty increase on a non-essential, indeed poisonous and\r\n\r\nanti-social,  item like tobacco will not affect  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving of sensible people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habit of smoking has been only slightly diminished in\r\n\r\nits rise in consumption by price increases. Despite the ban on\r\n\r\nadvertisements,   and   the  well   proven   health   hazards,\r\n\r\nconsumption has gone up, although at a slower rate, especially\r\n\r\nin  the more expensive imported cigarettes. What is deplorable\r\n\r\nis  that the young are being seduced into smoking. We may  not\r\n\r\nchange  the  habits of the veteran smokers, who believe,  like\r\n\r\nsome of my Cabinet colleagues, that they are immunised against\r\n\r\nlung  and  other pulmonary diseases since decades  of  smoking\r\n\r\nhave done them no harm. I wish them continued good health. But\r\n\r\nthe  young must be spared this dangerous habit. The weight  of\r\n\r\nmedical  authorities in the West are agreed that the risks  of\r\n\r\ncancer in lungs and nasal passages increase immeasurably  with\r\n\r\nsmoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Concessions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a number of Tax concessions to develop\r\n\r\nSingapore further as a financial centre and promote the  Asian\r\n\r\nDollar Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, fees, interest or commissions received by Asian\r\n\r\nCurrency  Units  for advising, confirming or refinancing  off-shore  letters of credit will be taxed at the reduced rate  of\r\n\r\n10%  under  Section 43A of the Income Tax Act. This concession\r\n\r\nwill take effect from the Year of Assessment 1977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, non-resident deposits with Asian Currency Units and\r\n\r\napproved  Asian Dollar bonds, held by non-residents,  will  be\r\n\r\nexempt from Singapore estate duty with effect from 1st January\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Singapore Government tax-free bonds, held by non-residents, will also be exempt from Singapore estate duty from\r\n\r\n1st January, 1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the food and commodity shortages,\r\n\r\nprice  increases and unstable exchange rates, and the measures\r\n\r\nwe  were forced to take over the past two years since the  oil\r\n\r\ncrisis, the financial policy outlined in this year's Statement\r\n\r\nis  a relatively unexciting one.
