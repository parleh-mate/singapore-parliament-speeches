But being public officers,\r\n\r\nif  they sustain injuries in the course of discharging\r\n\r\npublic duties, they are covered under two schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scheme is the Pensions Ordinance, 1956.\r\n\r\nUnder Regulation 19 of this Ordinance, the quantum  of\r\n\r\ncompensation where payable as a result of injury is in\r\n\r\naddition  to any pension, gratuity or other  allowance\r\n\r\ngranted  under  the  same Ordinance.  Subject  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Ordinance, the quantum of the annual\r\n\r\nallowance payable as compensation ranges from  5/60ths\r\n\r\n(for  slight impairment of earning capacity) to  1/3rd\r\n\r\n(for  total  destruction of earning  capacity)  of  an\r\n\r\nofficer's emoluments at the date of injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second scheme is the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance.  Under  this  Ordinance,  where  a   public\r\n\r\nofficer   (including  a  technical  teacher,  workshop\r\n\r\ninstructor,    workshop   attendant,   and    workshop\r\n\r\nassistant)  is  classified as a \"workman\"  and  is  in\r\n\r\nreceipt  of a salary not exceeding $400 per month,  he\r\n\r\nis  entitled  to  be compensated under  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation  Ordinance provided  he  is  not  paid  a\r\n\r\npension  or  gratuity  for such injury.  The  rate  of\r\n\r\ncompensation is governed by the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the question deals with insurance\r\n\r\ncoverage  for students. The Ministry assists  students\r\n\r\nin  taking  personal accident insurance coverage  when\r\n\r\nthey are sent for practical training to any industrial\r\n\r\nestablishment,  job sites, and schools.  Students  are\r\n\r\nadvised  but  not  compelled  to  participate  in  the\r\n\r\ninsurance scheme. So far all students\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcerned  have  joined the scheme,  as  the  rate  of\r\n\r\npremium  is  relatively low, i.e. $1 per  student  per\r\n\r\nmonth for a capital sum assured for $10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of injury caused by the negligence or\r\n\r\nomission   of  the  teacher  or  instructor   in   the\r\n\r\nvocational institutes, the Government and the  teacher\r\n\r\nor  instructor concerned are jointly liable, and it is\r\n\r\nfor the injured party to determine which party or both\r\n\r\nparties  to  sue  for  damages.  However,  the  school\r\n\r\nauthorities  will  not  be  liable  if  all  necessary\r\n\r\nprecautions and safeguards have been taken to  prevent\r\n\r\naccidents  in schools. Adequate action has been  taken\r\n\r\nto  ensure that safety precautions are observed in all\r\n\r\nschools, vocational institutes and industrial training\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the onus of providing insurance coverage against accidents not caused by negligence of the school authorities in industrial training institutions should rest on the parents, and I do urge parents to take insurance coverage for their own children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary has stated that  teachers\r\n\r\nof   Government   schools  sent  to   the   vocational\r\n\r\ninstitutes  as  instructors  are  covered  under   two\r\n\r\nschemes.

These  lorries transport timber logs  from  the\r\n\r\nrailway  yard at Keppel Road to the various  sawmills,\r\n\r\nmost  of  which are situated in the Kallang  Road  and\r\n\r\nLavender  Street  areas,  and must  inevitably  travel\r\n\r\nthrough the City centre. It would not be conducive  to\r\n\r\nour timber trade, however, if transportation of timber\r\n\r\nlogs to sawmills were to be restricted to outside  the\r\n\r\npeak periods of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police are watching the situation very\r\n\r\ncarefully,  and drivers of timber lorries are  advised\r\n\r\nto keep to the left-hand side of the road so as not to\r\n\r\nhinder vehicular traffic and also endanger other  road\r\n\r\nusers.  The  Traffic Police are also taking  stringent\r\n\r\naction  against  these lorry drivers  for  failure  to\r\n\r\ncomply with the traffic laws for speeding, for causing\r\n\r\nobstruction, and having smoky exhausts.

This means that a Member would have  to\r\n\r\nserve not less than two full terms of five years  each\r\n\r\nin  order to qualify for pension. A Member who  serves\r\n\r\nfor two terms, any of which is less than the full term\r\n\r\nof  five years, would therefore not be eligible for  a\r\n\r\npension unless he is elected for a third term.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, a Member of Parliament can qualify for\r\n\r\na  pension  at  the age of forty years, while  in  New\r\n\r\nZealand Members of Parliament are entitled to pensions\r\n\r\nafter nine years' service and on attaining the age  of\r\n\r\nfifty  years. In Canada, on the other hand, a  pension\r\n\r\nis paid to a Member of Parliament who serves more than\r\n\r\ntwo terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore proposed to amend the Act so that a\r\n\r\nMember  who has put in nine years' reckonable service,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  ten,  would  qualify  for  pension.   The\r\n\r\nqualifying age for the grant of pension is also  being\r\n\r\nreduced from fifty years to forty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, only a Speaker who is also an elected\r\n\r\nMember  of Parliament may qualify for pension, and  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed to amend the Act so that a Speaker who is\r\n\r\nnot an elected Member may\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso qualify for pension. It is only reasonable that a\r\n\r\nperson who serves in Parliament as Speaker, whether or\r\n\r\nnot he is an elected Member, should be eligible for  a\r\n\r\npension for the service he puts in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may also be cases where persons who are\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament subsequently cease to be Members\r\n\r\nwithout  having served the minimum period  to  qualify\r\n\r\nfor  pension but who, nevertheless, on ceasing  to  be\r\n\r\nMembers,  may  hold  public  offices  such   as   High\r\n\r\nCommissioners or Ambassadors for several  more  years.\r\n\r\nSuch  persons  should be adequately  provided  for  in\r\n\r\ntheir  declining  years.

In addition, he will get an annual\r\n\r\nentertainment allowance of $10,000, also tax free. The\r\n\r\nexpenses  for  maintaining the President's  household,\r\n\r\ntogether with salaries for his personal staff, come to\r\n\r\n$474,000  a year. By clause 3 of the Bill, the  amount\r\n\r\npayable  under this Schedule is charged on and payable\r\n\r\nout of the Consolidated Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity is also taken in the Bill to provide for\r\n\r\nthe  President's pension when he retires. At  present,\r\n\r\nthere is no statutory provision for the payment  of  a\r\n\r\npension to a former President. All civil servants  are\r\n\r\ngiven  pension  rights; in Singapore, all  persons  in\r\n\r\nemployment have at least the protection of the Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund to provide for them and their  families\r\n\r\nin  their  retiring years; and, since July last  year,\r\n\r\neven politicians who have been M.P.s can have pensions\r\n\r\nprovided  certain  conditions  are  met.  It  is  only\r\n\r\nreasonable therefore that our President, who holds the\r\n\r\nhighest  office  in the land, should be  superannuated\r\n\r\nfor his services on his ceasing to be a President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II of the Bill, therefore, provides for the\r\n\r\npayment of pension or gratuity to \"former\" Presidents.\r\n\r\nClause 8 of the Bill provides that a former President,\r\n\r\nwho  has  ceased to hold office, shall  be  granted  a\r\n\r\npension  or  gratuity of such amount  and  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances as Parliament may determine. No specific\r\n\r\nperiod  of  service as a President is prescribed,  and\r\n\r\nthe Bill leaves it to the discretion of Parliament  to\r\n\r\ndetermine the amount to be paid. This discretion  will\r\n\r\ngive  flexibility to meet changing circumstances,  and\r\n\r\nParliament can be relied upon to determine  an  amount\r\n\r\nthat  would  allow a former President  to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nstandard of life in keeping with the exalted office he\r\n\r\nhas held.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[Mr Tang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has a threefold purpose. Members may\r\n\r\nrecall  that  a Gift Voucher Scheme was introduced  in\r\n\r\nMay  last  year with the object of encouraging  newly-weds,  national servicemen and others to save  in  the\r\n\r\nPostal  Savings Bank. It has been found  necessary  to\r\n\r\nprovide legislative authority in connection with  this\r\n\r\nScheme and, therefore, a new section 7A is inserted in\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  to  empower the Postmaster-General  to\r\n\r\nsell  Post  Office Savings Bank Gift Vouchers  and  to\r\n\r\naccept them as deposits into Post Office Savings  Bank\r\n\r\naccounts.  Section 21 is also amended to  empower  the\r\n\r\nMinister to prescribe conditions for the sale,  issue,\r\n\r\nrefund, etc, of such vouchers. These amendments are to\r\n\r\nbe   back-dated  to  2nd  May,  1969,  the   date   of\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Gift Voucher Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other purposes of this Bill are to amend\r\n\r\nsections 9 and 11 (1) which deal with the prescription\r\n\r\nof  interest rates and the investments of Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank funds respectively. At present, section 9\r\n\r\nallows a variation in the interest rates to be paid on\r\n\r\nsavings deposits after giving three months' notice  in\r\n\r\nthe  Government Gazette. For greater flexibility, this\r\n\r\nrequirement of three months' notice is being  deleted.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, section  11(1)  is   amended   to   allow\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  investments.

At\r\n\r\npresent,  the Load Line Convention, 1930,  applies  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  is  implemented  by  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nlegislation which was extended to Singapore.  The  new\r\n\r\nInternational  Convention of  1966,  which  came  into\r\n\r\nforce   in  July  1968,  takes  into  account   modern\r\n\r\ntechnological  advances in shipbuilding  and  provides\r\n\r\nfor  tankers  of  over 600 feet  in  length.  The  new\r\n\r\nConvention  also  provides certain  advantages  -  for\r\n\r\nexample,  it  allows deeper loading which  results  in\r\n\r\nabout  4  per cent increase in carrying capacity,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  earning capacity, for some tankers.  It  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for Singapore to accept the 1966 Convention\r\n\r\nso  that  Singapore-registered  ships  can  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of  deeper  loading, and  furthermore  ships\r\n\r\ncalling  at  Singapore are often loaded in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith the 1966 Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of acceptance of the Convention, the\r\n\r\nMerchant Shipping Ordinance needs to be amended.

At present harbour craft\r\n\r\nwhich  are registered either in Singapore or elsewhere\r\n\r\nare  exempted  from licensing. This  means  that  such\r\n\r\ncraft  are  not  subject to control and can  therefore\r\n\r\navoid  safety and other requirements. There have  been\r\n\r\ninstances  where condemned craft sold for breaking  up\r\n\r\nas  scrap  were subsequently registered under  foreign\r\n\r\nflags  and  being operated as harbour craft.  This  is\r\n\r\nclearly  undesirable on grounds of safety.

Since\r\n\r\nthen,  new  demands and recent changes in the  policy,\r\n\r\nadministration and management of national  service  in\r\n\r\nSingapore have rendered it necessary to introduce  new\r\n\r\nlegislation on the subject. The said National  Service\r\n\r\nOrdinance,  1952, has been found to be  inadequate  to\r\n\r\nmeet  such  changed  conditions.

All these are explained in  great\r\n\r\ndetail in the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although our national service scheme has been\r\n\r\nimplemented for only a few years, the facts have shown\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  achieved  100 per  cent  success.  All\r\n\r\nparents understand the Government's policy of building\r\n\r\nup  our national defence because they realise that, as\r\n\r\nan  independent newly emergent country, we should have\r\n\r\nour  own defence capability. Therefore, they encourage\r\n\r\ntheir children to take up national service in order to\r\n\r\nreceive  military training and to shoulder the  sacred\r\n\r\ntask of defending their country. Our young men\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  also shown their courage, resolution and loyalty\r\n\r\nin  national defence. I believe that, for the sake  of\r\n\r\nour  national  defence, independence, sovereignty  and\r\n\r\nterritorial  integrity, all loyal  citizens  will  not\r\n\r\noppose  national service and will not  object  to  its\r\n\r\nimportance  to our country. They will agree  with  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we must also recognise that since\r\n\r\nthe implementation of the national service scheme,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been experiencing a shortage of labour or skills\r\n\r\nin  certain fields. In this respect, I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify the Government's policy of opening\r\n\r\nthe  door  wider  to non-citizens to  apply  for  work\r\n\r\npermits. The questions are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Whether the implementation of this Bill will\r\n\r\ncreate a labour shortage in our labour market. If so,\r\n\r\nhas the Minister any remedial measures?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the Government's policy in relation to\r\n\r\napplications  by students in colleges and universities\r\n\r\nfor  delayed  or postponed national service?  Has  the\r\n\r\nGovernment any better arrangement whereby there can be\r\n\r\na  balance between military training and the education\r\n\r\nof  the  boys  so  that there will be no  shortage  of\r\n\r\npersonnel  for  nation building,  and  no  undesirable\r\n\r\nconsequences in this respect?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Bill contains certain provisions regarding\r\n\r\nthe  employment of national servicemen. These are  all\r\n\r\nvery  good.  But  if  certain employers  disregard  or\r\n\r\ninfringe  these  provisions, what  measures  will  the\r\n\r\nGovernment take to deal with them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Government has announced that it will give\r\n\r\npriority   of  employment  opportunities  to  national\r\n\r\nservice  personnel. This is a very reasonable  measure\r\n\r\nand  it  has  been announced many times.  But  I  have\r\n\r\nrecently  received  complaints from  people  who  have\r\n\r\nundergone two years' full-time national service. Their\r\n\r\ncomplaint is that they have not been able to  get  any\r\n\r\njobs  even after two or three months of their  release\r\n\r\nfrom  national  service.  I  hope  the  Minister   can\r\n\r\ninvestigate  into this matter and try  to  remedy  it.\r\n\r\nHowever, national service\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  the bounden duty of every citizen. If we want  our\r\n\r\ncountry  to  survive,  we must  ensure  that  we  have\r\n\r\nstability and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure that in\r\n\r\nhis  heart of hearts the Member for Sembawang welcomes\r\n\r\nnational service. I shall try to clear up his doubts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned in this House before that there is\r\n\r\nno  question of a labour shortage being caused when we\r\n\r\nconscript the 18-year olds. What I said was that there\r\n\r\nwould  be  a  temporary  labour shortage  while  these\r\n\r\npeople are in national service. There would be a delay\r\n\r\nof  two  years  before they come out into  the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket. Moreover, the present labour shortage  is  not\r\n\r\nso  much a shortage of unskilled labour. When a boy or\r\n\r\na  girl  of  18  years leaves school,  he  or  she  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  as unskilled labour. The present  shortage\r\n\r\nis greater in respect of skilled labour than unskilled\r\n\r\nlabour. So I would say that enlistment or conscription\r\n\r\nof  our 18-year olds will not cause a labour shortage.\r\n\r\nIt   is   actually   a  delay  in  supplying   labour.\r\n\r\nConscription first began in 1967. And in 1969 some  of\r\n\r\nthe  national servicemen were released,  and  quite  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of them have been placed in employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the complaint voiced by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  -that those who have  been  discharged\r\n\r\nfrom  the armed forces after a service of two or three\r\n\r\nyears,  as  the  case  may be, have  found  themselves\r\n\r\nwithout  jobs for three months or so. We will  try  to\r\n\r\nplace  all  discharged  personnel  in  employment   as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible, but this takes time. In our short\r\n\r\nexperience of national service, we have found that  we\r\n\r\nhave   had  no  difficulty  in  placing  a  discharged\r\n\r\nnational  serviceman in employment if he is  not  very\r\n\r\nparticular.  Some of them are really choosey  as  they\r\n\r\nfeel  that  they  deserve  more  than  what  they  are\r\n\r\noffered. But I think that less than five per cent  are\r\n\r\nstill unplaced after three months of their discharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  most  cases,  if  a  national  serviceman  has   a\r\n\r\nrealistic assessment of his capabilities, a  job  will\r\n\r\nbe found for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problem of either conscripting the 18-year olds or allowing them to continue with their\r\n\r\neducation, we have considered that very carefully  and\r\n\r\nhave  devised  a scheme. I would like  to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  last  year, of those who  have  the  full\r\n\r\nHigher  School  Certificate, we have  given  deferment\r\n\r\nfrom national service to 855, and have allowed them to\r\n\r\nproceed to higher institutions of learning. As for the\r\n\r\nrest of those who have obtained the full H.S.C., about\r\n\r\n572  have  not been called up, and we expect  to  call\r\n\r\nthem up by June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a discussion going on at present between my\r\n\r\nofficers  and  those from the institutions  of  higher\r\n\r\nlearning,  particularly  Nanyang  University  and  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore, to  make  arrangements  for\r\n\r\nconscripts  with full H.S.C, qualifications  to  do  a\r\n\r\nyear's course of study if they are chosen as officers.\r\n\r\nWith  this arrangement, the completion of three years'\r\n\r\nservice  in  the Army would be taken as equivalent  to\r\n\r\nthe  first year in the university, so that after their\r\n\r\ndischarge as officers of the armed forces, they  could\r\n\r\njoin  the  university at the second-year level.  There\r\n\r\nare  a  lot  of details to be worked out,  but  I  can\r\n\r\nassure Members that both parties, i.e., officials from\r\n\r\nthe  universities  and my officers, are  trying  their\r\n\r\nvery  best  to work out a solution for those  who  are\r\n\r\nconscripted  and  fit enough to  be  officers  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Armed Forces to save a year in  the  higher\r\n\r\ninstitutions  of  learning after they  are  discharged\r\n\r\nfrom national service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question raised by the Member for Sembawang\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  employment of national  servicemen.  He\r\n\r\nasked  me whether we can take action against employers\r\n\r\nwho  infringe the provisions of the Bill.  I  think  I\r\n\r\nhave  already mentioned that any person who  fails  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  any  of the provisions under  this  Bill\r\n\r\nshall   be   guilty  of  an  offence  and  liable   to\r\n\r\nimprisonment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  a term not exceeding three years or to a fine not\r\n\r\nexceeding   $5,000,   or  to  both   such   fine   and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have fully replied to all the queries raised.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  has  omitted  to  answer  one  of   my\r\n\r\nquestions.

To  justify\r\n\r\ntheir  entry into such unlicensed premises, the Police\r\n\r\nhave  to  rely  on  the  provisions  of  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code. The procedure is cumbersome  in  that\r\n\r\nthe  Police  must  obtain, in the  first  instance,  a\r\n\r\nsearch warrant from a Magistrate's Court.

I  think Members will agree that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  survival for ourselves  that  our  society\r\n\r\nshould  be a closely knitted one with special emphasis\r\n\r\non  the  strict exercise of social discipline  by  its\r\n\r\nmembers.  Such  a pattern of life makes it  imperative\r\n\r\nfor  every member of society to value the comfort  and\r\n\r\nconvenience of his fellow citizens as much as his own,\r\n\r\nand  that he should completely and voluntarily refrain\r\n\r\nfrom acts that make life miserable for others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In matters such as smoking in public, the ideal\r\n\r\nsolution is for the smoker to exercise self-discipline\r\n\r\nand  to see to it that his smoking does not cause  any\r\n\r\ndiscomfort  to persons around him. However,  this  has\r\n\r\nnot always been the case. Only after traditional forms\r\n\r\nof  public  exhortation  have failed  to  produce  the\r\n\r\ndesired  effect  is the law being invoked  to  give  a\r\n\r\nhelping  hand,  in fact, the Ministry  of  Health  has\r\n\r\ngiven  attention to the problem of smoking in  cinemas\r\n\r\nand  theatres since 1966. The voluntary ban on smoking\r\n\r\nin  certain cinemas which started in 1967 has not been\r\n\r\nvery fruitful in that, in practice, the patrons of the\r\n\r\ncinemas  concerned have simply and invariably  ignored\r\n\r\nthe management's request to refrain from smoking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be pointed out that smoking under crowded\r\n\r\nconditions   within  enclosed  spaces   or   in   air-conditioned rooms causes a nuisance and irritation  to\r\n\r\nthe other occupants, especially the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-smokers.

Further, the smoke  screen\r\n\r\nin  the  auditorium  not only interferes  with  proper\r\n\r\nviewing,  but  also makes the eyes smart.  This  Bill,\r\n\r\nhowever,   by  prohibiting  smoking  in  cinemas   and\r\n\r\ntheatres,  and  certain  other  places  that  may   be\r\n\r\nspecified by the Minister, is designed to remove  this\r\n\r\nsource  of  nuisance and irritation, thereby enhancing\r\n\r\nthe pleasure and comfort of the patrons of the cinemas\r\n\r\nand theatres as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in the auditorium\r\n\r\nof any cinema or theatre and in any specified building\r\n\r\nat any time during which these are open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe  expressions  \"cinema\", \"theatre\"  and  \"specified\r\n\r\nbuilding\" have been carefully defined. The prohibition\r\n\r\non  smoking  is  confined only to  the  auditorium  of\r\n\r\ncinemas  and theatres to which members of  the  public\r\n\r\nare  admitted upon payment of admission fees, and only\r\n\r\nduring  the periods when these are open to the public.\r\n\r\nThe  premises of clubs, associations and the like have\r\n\r\nbeen  expressly  excluded from  this  prohibition.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  obviate the need for an amending Act  at  a\r\n\r\nfuture  date, the Minister is empowered, under  clause\r\n\r\n3,  to  specify in the Gazette any particular building\r\n\r\nor class of buildings or part thereof to which members\r\n\r\nof  the  public have access as being a place or places\r\n\r\nin   which  smoking  shall  not  be  permitted  either\r\n\r\npermanently or for such period or periods  as  he  may\r\n\r\ndeem fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for smoking in prohibited places is a\r\n\r\nfine not exceeding $500 and enforcement action will be\r\n\r\nby  means of ticketing. This device has been found  to\r\n\r\nbe very suitable, effective and expeditious in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  persons caught littering in public places  under\r\n\r\nsection  26  of the Environmental Public  Health  Act,\r\n\r\n1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main task of enforcing the prohibition will fall\r\n\r\non  the  public  health auxiliaries  attached  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Health Division and police officers.  Managers\r\n\r\nof cinemas, theatres and other specified buildings are\r\n\r\nrequired  to  display  notices in  four  languages  in\r\n\r\nconspicuous  positions stating that smoking  has  been\r\n\r\nprohibited and the penalty provided therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibility has also been placed on managers and\r\n\r\ncertain  authorised  employees  of  these  places   to\r\n\r\nrequest  any persons smoking therein to cease  smoking\r\n\r\nforthwith,  and  if such persons fail to  comply  with\r\n\r\ntheir  request,  to require them to  leave  the  place\r\n\r\nforthwith  without  entitlement to  refund  of  ticket\r\n\r\nmoney. Should the management encounter any difficulty,\r\n\r\nthey may seek the assistance of any police officer  or\r\n\r\na  public health auxiliary. Provisions have also  been\r\n\r\nincluded for the punishment of any person who  abuses,\r\n\r\nhinders  or  assaults the manager  or  any  authorised\r\n\r\nemployee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other clauses are explained in greater detail in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory Note accompanying the Bill, and I  do\r\n\r\nnot  wish to take up the time of this House to  repeat\r\n\r\nthem.  All I need stress is that the success  of  this\r\n\r\nmeasure  depends  very much on  the  support  and  co-operation the public give to the Government.  The  law\r\n\r\ncannot  be everywhere. There is nothing more effective\r\n\r\nthan  the  reproachful eye of the public to prevent  a\r\n\r\nsmoker  from causing nuisance to his fellow  citizens.\r\n\r\nWith the law spelt out clearly on their side, the non-smoking public can now stand up to assert their  right\r\n\r\nto  more  comfortable conditions in cinemas,  theatres\r\n\r\nand other specified places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that this Bill will have the support\r\n\r\nof  Members  of this House and it is for  the  greater\r\n\r\ngood of all the patrons of cinemas and theatres, while\r\n\r\nit will not cause any hardship to any person, not even\r\n\r\nto the smokers themselves. I expect that after a while\r\n\r\nthey  will  acquire  the good  habit  of  looking  for\r\n\r\nconvenient places when the urge to smoke comes, places\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch as the toilets or lobbies where they can smoke to\r\n\r\ntheir  hearts'  content  without  causing  any  public\r\n\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish further to assure Members that enforcement\r\n\r\naction   will  only  be  taken  after  an  educational\r\n\r\ncampaign which will be conducted later this year,  and\r\n\r\nthat   this  law  will  be  applied  with  the  utmost\r\n\r\ndiscretion and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.58 p.m. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok.

Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, any Bill that is introduced\r\n\r\nshould  be  a  Bill that is enforceable, and  strictly\r\n\r\nenforceable.  For  the last few years,  we  have  seen\r\n\r\nnotices  in  cinema halls quite prominently  displayed\r\n\r\nrequesting patrons not to smoke. They have been abused\r\n\r\nand  I  am afraid they will continue to be abused.  We\r\n\r\nsee   in  the  theatres  persons  smoking.  There  are\r\n\r\nportions  in  the  buses  -public  transport  -  where\r\n\r\nsmoking  is allowed and a front portion where  smoking\r\n\r\nis  not  allowed. Yet any bus traveller will tell  you\r\n\r\nthat  this  regulation is not at all  enforced.  Taxi-drivers,  Sir,  are, I think, under the Ordinance  not\r\n\r\nallowed to smoke. You need only stand on the road  and\r\n\r\nyou  can see taxi-drivers smoking happily. Just a  few\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  I  read  a  reply from  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  that  on inspection every  six  months,  the\r\n\r\nRegistry  sees  to it that taxis contain  an  ashtray.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  travel in a taxi almost every day and I  have\r\n\r\nyet  to  come  across a taxi with, an ashtray  in  the\r\n\r\nfront seat, or the back seat for that matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes go to the theatre and I notice that\r\n\r\npeople who are smokers start to smoke as soon as  they\r\n\r\nsee advertisements of cigarettes on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, during the last Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  I  made a point about doing away  with  these\r\n\r\nadvertisements, but the Minister for  Health  did  not\r\n\r\ngive me an answer. The melodious jingles on cigarettes\r\n\r\nput  on TV and over the radio are repeated by children\r\n\r\nand  they sound better than the pop songs that we hear\r\n\r\nof. Sir, what should I do, as a smoker, when I go to a\r\n\r\ntheatre  and  see  an advertisement,  \"Smoke  Kingsize\r\n\r\nCigarettes\", and, at the same time, another notice  by\r\n\r\nthe side telling me not to smoke?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is going to enforce the law of no-smoking in\r\n\r\ncinemas? The managers, assistant managers and  ushers?\r\n\r\nSir,  in  every  cinema there are only  two  or  three\r\n\r\nushers  and they cannot be looking out for people  who\r\n\r\nsmoke.  Furthermore, this is not a law  which  can  be\r\n\r\neasily enforceable. I agree with the Minister that, as\r\n\r\na  follow-up to this Bill, there should be a  campaign\r\n\r\nlike  the \"Anti-litter Campaign\" that we had recently.\r\n\r\nI  wish  the Minister luck and I hope this law can  be\r\n\r\nenforceable. But I have my misgivings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, which the Minister spoke\r\n\r\nabout,  is,  I  think,  rather  loose  and  gives  the\r\n\r\nMinister far too much powers. It says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may, by notification in the Gazette\r\n\r\nand  subject to such conditions as he may  think  fit,\r\n\r\nspecify  any  building or part  thereof  or  class  of\r\n\r\nbuildings  or  parts thereof to which members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic have access as being a place or places in which\r\n\r\nsmoking  shall not be permitted either permanently  or\r\n\r\nfor such period or periods as he may think fit.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I  know that the Minister for Health is  a  non-smoker.  One day he may decide to prohibit smoking  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health. I think this law may  not  be\r\n\r\nworkable  if it applies only to theatres. I  was  just\r\n\r\nwondering whether stricter measures cannot be taken to\r\n\r\nprohibit  smoking  in buses and taxis  also.  And  the\r\n\r\nprecondition is that we have to ban advertisements  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes on T.V., cinemas and over the radio, which,\r\n\r\nI believe, is more important than this legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  Bill seeks to prohibit smoking in certain places\r\n\r\nwhich  include cinemas. Undoubtedly this measure  will\r\n\r\ncause  some inconvenience to smokers in certain places\r\n\r\nat  certain  times. Possibly these people may  include\r\n\r\nsome  Members of the House who have taken to  smoking.\r\n\r\nBut  to  those  members of the  public  who  are  non-smokers,  this  Bill brings good tidings.  As  a  non-\r\n\r\nsmoker, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, speaking dispassionately, smoking is a bad\r\n\r\nhabit. Medical practitioners have made researches into\r\n\r\nsmoking  and  have found that it is harmful  and  will\r\n\r\ncause  cancer  of  the  lungs. They  therefore  advise\r\n\r\npeople  that  if they value their lives at  all,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  smoke. From the economic point  of  view,\r\n\r\nsmoking is a waste of money because money is literally\r\n\r\ngoing  up  in  smoke. Of course, to  people  who  have\r\n\r\nmoney,  the  amount  that they  spend  on  smoking  is\r\n\r\nnegligible.  But to a person whose monthly  income  is\r\n\r\n$100  to  $200, the necessity to satisfy his  urge  to\r\n\r\nsmoke  by  spending a dollar or two a day  will  bring\r\n\r\nconsiderable hardship to his family. In spite  of  the\r\n\r\nharm  in  smoking,  the  number  of  smokers  is   not\r\n\r\ndecreasing.  That  is  because  one  man's  poison  is\r\n\r\nanother man's food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before us today is not to enforce a\r\n\r\ncomplete ban on smoking. It seeks to ban smoking  only\r\n\r\nin  certain places. As a matter of fact, nobody at the\r\n\r\npresent juncture expects the Government to introduce a\r\n\r\nBill to ban smoking totally, because doing so will  be\r\n\r\nunwise. That would mean a loss of revenue in terms  of\r\n\r\nhundreds of thousands of dollars. But, in any case, it\r\n\r\nis  my view that in order to bring up a healthy second\r\n\r\ngeneration,  we have the responsibility  of  educating\r\n\r\nour  younger generation, particularly children in  the\r\n\r\nschools,  to cultivate good habits, which include  the\r\n\r\nhabit  of  not  smoking. I do  not  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health agrees with this point of view. No\r\n\r\ndoubt  we  are an open and free society and  everybody\r\n\r\nhas the freedom to indulge his propensity for smoking.\r\n\r\nBut this freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  limited  to  the extent that  it  should  not\r\n\r\ninterfere  with the comfort of others.  Therefore,  in\r\n\r\npublic  places like cinemas or public buses, we should\r\n\r\nrespect  the feelings of those around us. We must  not\r\n\r\ndo  things  which  will cause them any  discomfort  or\r\n\r\ninconvenience. For example, in the cinema, if you  are\r\n\r\nconcentrating on the screen and enjoying the show  and\r\n\r\nthe people around you happen to be smokers who have no\r\n\r\nregard  for  your feelings or your comfort,  then  you\r\n\r\nwill   be  literally  smoked  in!  These  people  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to smoke, and because they smoke,  they  may\r\n\r\ncough  and spit. This will nauseate you. This kind  of\r\n\r\npublic  behaviour  will really  adversely  affect  the\r\n\r\nfeelings and comfort of others around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are some cinemas which screen notices requesting the audience not to smoke. But people who are smokers continue to smoke, and because there is no enforcement of these notices, they are simply ignored. I believe this Bill will bring better results and make our public places, like the\r\n\r\ncinemas,  better,  healthier and  cleaner  places  for\r\n\r\nthose  members  of the public who wish  to  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nfacilities  provided.  I must however  admit  that  it\r\n\r\ntakes time to cultivate a good habit. On this basis, I\r\n\r\nexpress  the  hope that in the earlier stages  of  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of this Bill, the punishment meted  out\r\n\r\nto  offenders  should  not be too  severe.  A  warning\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  to  the first offender.  We  should\r\n\r\nenforce  the  law  with some humane considerations.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  only in this way can we achieve  better\r\n\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  I  wish  to  suggest  that,  firstly,   a\r\n\r\npublicity  campaign  should  be  carried  out  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, over the Radio and Rediffusion and on T.V.\r\n\r\nto  make the people understand the intentions  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  and  to  help  them obey the law.  Secondly,  in\r\n\r\nplaces  where  smoking is banned, such as  cinemas  or\r\n\r\nbuses,  notices  should  be  displayed  in  the   four\r\n\r\nofficial  languages so that members of the public  are\r\n\r\nmade to realise that the ban is on and that no offence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  be  committed  out of ignorance.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister will give due consideration to my proposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, it is my view that the Bill\r\n\r\nhas  the  same good intentions as the \"Keep  Singapore\r\n\r\nClean  Campaign\", that is, to inculcate in our  people\r\n\r\ngood social habits and discipline. I believe this Bill\r\n\r\nwill receive wide support from the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  fully  support  the  Bill to  prohibit  smoking  in\r\n\r\ncinemas  or theatres. I only regret that the  Minister\r\n\r\ndid  not include the prohibition of smoking in  public\r\n\r\nbuses  and  taxis. I sincerely hope that at  the  next\r\n\r\nsitting,  if  possible,  the  Minister  will  move  an\r\n\r\namendment  to  include the prohibition of  smoking  in\r\n\r\nbuses  and taxis so that there will be no nuisance  to\r\n\r\nthe passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  merely  to underline the points that  have  been\r\n\r\nbrought  up,  especially  by  the  Member  for   Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah. One of his points regarding the necessity  to\r\n\r\nprohibit   smoking  in  buses  too  has   again   been\r\n\r\nemphasised. But I wish to say how fortuitous it is and\r\n\r\nwhat a happy coincidence that the Acting Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  is  also the Minister for Culture! That  being\r\n\r\nthe case, perhaps notice can be taken of the necessity\r\n\r\nto  encourage  theatre managers  to  remove  cigarette\r\n\r\nadvertisements from the screen. In order to do that, I\r\n\r\nthink  the Ministry of Culture should set the  example\r\n\r\nby  removing these advertisements from T.V, and  over\r\n\r\nthe radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must thank\r\n\r\nMembers  for their enthusiastic support for this  Bill\r\n\r\nand  I am quite sure that the Ministry of Health  will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to carry out all the suggestions put forward\r\n\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only need to reply in brief to several points made\r\n\r\nby  Members. In the first place, the Member for  Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah has complained about the lack of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nashtrays  in  taxis and buses. As a smoker  -  he  has\r\n\r\nadmitted  this  - he finds the lack of  this  facility\r\n\r\nvery  inconvenient. But I do not think he  need  worry\r\n\r\nabout  the enforcement of this Bill. Judging from  the\r\n\r\nspeech   he   has   made  just  now   condemning   the\r\n\r\nirresponsible behaviour of smokers, I do not think  he\r\n\r\nwill  want to run the risk of being caught smoking  in\r\n\r\nan auditorium!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The complaint about the lack of ashtrays in taxis\r\n\r\nand  buses  has  to  be referred to the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles. I am sure he will look into this matter more\r\n\r\nclosely.  Smoking  in buses is very  undesirable.  The\r\n\r\npublic, especially the non-smoking public, should play\r\n\r\ntheir  part more effectively. I do not think we should\r\n\r\nleave  everything  to the law. The  public  should  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  play an effective role in maintaining  good\r\n\r\nsocial order. If the provisions in this Bill are found\r\n\r\nto  be  inadequate, I am sure the Ministry  of  Health\r\n\r\nwill  put  forward  further amendments  to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards advertisements of cigarettes in public,\r\n\r\nespecially on television and over the radio,  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  it is morally unjustifiable for these two  media\r\n\r\nto  advertise them when the Government is  prohibiting\r\n\r\nsmoking  in cinemas and theatres. However, I must  say\r\n\r\nthat most of the contracts to advertise cigarettes  on\r\n\r\nTV, and  over the radio were accepted some time  ago,\r\n\r\nand  most of them run for a period of at least  twelve\r\n\r\nmonths.  It is now our policy not to accept  contracts\r\n\r\nfor  advertisements of cigarettes  which  will  expire\r\n\r\nlater  than  the end of this year. It is fair  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  moment to allow these contracts to run  their\r\n\r\nnatural  course.  It  is not considered  necessary  to\r\n\r\nterminate them immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for advertising smoking in public, the Government\r\n\r\nwill  probably put forward certain amendments to  this\r\n\r\nHouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto prohibit all forms of advertisements of cigarettes\r\n\r\nas from 1st January, 1971. This is to prohibit the\r\n\r\nadvertisement of cigarettes in all media - newspapers,\r\n\r\nmagazines, T.V, and Radio, and billboards and so on.\r\n\r\nMembers will thus have no cause for complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do agree with the sentiments expressed by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang, and his strong condemnation  of\r\n\r\nsmoking in public. However, I think we should  have  a\r\n\r\ncertain degree of freedom in this country. Although we\r\n\r\ncan  prohibit smoking in cinemas, theatres and certain\r\n\r\nspecific  places, it is not desirable to  prohibit  it\r\n\r\naltogether.
