Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, there is no revival of any secret society\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmovement in Singapore.  Police has successfully broken up  the\r\n\r\nhardcore  secret  societies  of the  50s  and  60s,  which  were\r\n\r\nresponsible  for violent gang fights, protection  and  extortion\r\n\r\nrackets, through our tough laws and enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current gang situation in Singapore has taken on a\r\n\r\ndifferent form, dominated by loosely organised street gangs with\r\n\r\na  fluid  membership.  The majority of their  members  are  male\r\n\r\nChinese youths aged between 13 and 19.  Although they are not as\r\n\r\nvicious  as  the traditional secret society gangsters,  they  do\r\n\r\npose   law   and  order  problems  by  rioting  and   assembling\r\n\r\nunlawfully.   Some street gang fights have resulted  in  serious\r\n\r\ninjuries and even deaths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police recognises this problem and has taken steps to\r\n\r\naddress  it.  In 1998, Police conducted 906 anti-gang operations\r\n\r\ncovering entertainment outlets, shopping centres and known `hot-spots'.   Tough action will continue this year.  Police is  also\r\n\r\ntaking proactive measures to nip the problem in the bud.  Police\r\n\r\nreaches  out  to the youths directly.  For example, it  conducts\r\n\r\npreventive education programmes, such as school talks and visits\r\n\r\nto  the  prisons,  to educate youths on the  evils  and  adverse\r\n\r\nconsequences of joining gangs.  In 1998, such Police  programmes\r\n\r\nreached  over  9,000  youths.   This  twin  approach  of   tough\r\n\r\nenforcement  and  preventive education has  been  successful  in\r\n\r\nlowering the number of street gang related rioting from 39 cases\r\n\r\nin 1996 to 16 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, to what extent are\r\n\r\nthese  gang fights influenced by the presence of foreigners  and\r\n\r\nalso due to the current economic recession?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, Police has been very careful\r\n\r\nin keeping out foreign triads.

Like I said, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmajority  of  these are street gang type members.  So  they  can\r\n\r\nfight  out of staring incidents, sometimes keeping to turf,  and\r\n\r\nsometimes because of disagreements over certain matters.  So  it\r\n\r\nis not essentially linked to the economic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Is the Minister of State\r\n\r\naware  that there are still instances of extortion of protection\r\n\r\nmoney  by  members of either secret societies or what  he  terms\r\n\r\n\"street  gangs\"?   Is  he aware that when  such  instances  were\r\n\r\nbrought to the attention of the Police, the Police has asked the\r\n\r\nvictim  to  come  out  and identify those gang  members?   As  a\r\n\r\nresult, I am sure he is aware that most of these instances  were\r\n\r\nnot reported to the police.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc.

In fact, a few gangs were broken  up\r\n\r\nin  the Woodlands area just last year.  That is why we have  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Law  (Temporary Provisions) Act to act against  people\r\n\r\nwho  are operating such activities where it is difficult to  get\r\n\r\npeople to testify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLY AND SUPPLEMENTARY</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUPPLY BILLS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the second and third\r\n\r\nreadings   of  the  Supply  Bill  for  FY  1999/2000   and   the\r\n\r\nSupplementary Supply Bill for FY 1998/1999 may be proceeded with\r\n\r\nimmediately after the conclusion of the proceedings on the  Main\r\n\r\nand Development Estimates for FY 1999/2000. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu\r\n\r\nTau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Business Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the proceedings on\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates for FY 1999/2000 on 10th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th,\r\n\r\n17th  and 18th March 1999, be continued beyond 4.30 pm,  and  be\r\n\r\nexempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until  6.15\r\n\r\npm on each day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because many MPs have filed amendments to be moved\r\n\r\nin the Committee of Supply and we wish to give them as much time\r\n\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, notwithstanding the Standing Orders, the proceedings on\r\n\r\nthe  Estimates for FY 1999/2000 on 10th, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th,\r\n\r\n17th  and 18th March 1999, be continued beyond 4.30 pm,  and  be\r\n\r\nexempted from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1 until  6.15\r\n\r\npm on each day. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1999 TO</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>31ST MARCH 2000</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd 2 of 1999)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of Supply [lst\r\n\r\nAllotted Day].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of Singapore for the\r\n\r\nfinancial  year 1st April 1999 to 31st March 2000, contained  in\r\n\r\nPaper Cmd.

Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this cut on the Prime Minister's Office, I\r\n\r\nam  concerned  about  our policies regarding  development  of  a\r\n\r\nharmonious  multi-racial society.  May I begin, first,  Sir,  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that I believe we have had and enjoyed a good record  to\r\n\r\ndate.   I  think Singaporeans have matured in time to  accept  a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society as a cornerstone of Singapore.  My  concern\r\n\r\nis that this should not be taken for granted, especially in this\r\n\r\ntime of crisis.  In this regard, I wish to raise two points  for\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's Office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that it should be our policy to monitor\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  in  all matters, especially in  terms  of  jobs.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an  issue that has arisen recently in  private  sector\r\n\r\nhiring,  not in the Government.   But if this is not  addressed,\r\n\r\nthe  economic crisis would indeed test our social cohesion.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  to-date  has  responded  by  saying  that  it  would\r\n\r\ndiscourage discrimination and offer advice and moral leadership.\r\n\r\nI  think  this is correct, as a first step, and that legislation\r\n\r\nis  not  presently warranted.  However, I would urge  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office and the Government to monitor the situation as\r\n\r\nit unfolds and, if necessary, look to legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I wish to make on this cut is that I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister's Office would foster collaboration  between\r\n\r\nvarious  self-help  groups.   In  a  previous  speech  in   this\r\n\r\nParliament, I have given my thoughts on possible but  unintended\r\n\r\nconsequences  of  having separate ethnic  self-help  groups.   I\r\n\r\nshall  not  repeat  myself, but I do hope the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice  would  consider ways to encourage greater  collaboration\r\n\r\nbetween these different self-help groups.  In particular,  I  am\r\n\r\nthinking of budgets that are culled from each individual  budget\r\n\r\nto create a pool of resources.  Say, take 20% off each self-help\r\n\r\ngroup's  budget as Government support, and put it  to  a  common\r\n\r\npool.   Where  there are collaborative projects between  two  or\r\n\r\nmore of these groups, this pool can be called on, but not if the\r\n\r\nprojects  involve  only  to  one  ethnic  group.   Additionally,\r\n\r\nanother step that might help is to have a multi-cultural day  to\r\n\r\npromote  understanding and awareness of the important  value  of\r\n\r\nmulti-culturalism   in  our  multi-racial   and   multi-cultural\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, could I take both my\r\n\r\namendments together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanmugam:</b> The question of race and racial harmony in\r\n\r\nSingapore has been the subject of much attention recently.   The\r\n\r\ndebate   has   been   spurred  partly  by  President   Habibie's\r\n\r\nmisinformed and unfortunate remarks.  Clearly, President Habibie\r\n\r\nwas  wrong  to  have  expressed his views  and  his  views  have\r\n\r\nreceived a robust rebuff from Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, while we take pride in our genuine multi-racialism, it is also time for some reflection and\r\n\r\nintrospection.   In  the years after independence,  meritocracy,\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism, racial harmony and equal opportunity  were  the\r\n\r\narticles of faith on which our society and its component  racial\r\n\r\ngroups  sought to forge a new nationhood.  We wore our  equality\r\n\r\nof  opportunity to all on our sleeves.  That is why we were able\r\n\r\nto rebut President Habibie's remarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we have to now look forward to the next\r\n\r\n30  years  or  so  and  ask  if  the present  social  structure,\r\n\r\neducation  system and environment would provide for one  of  the\r\n\r\nprinciples,  namely, multi-racialism, to endure in  the  way  we\r\n\r\nunderstand it now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I say that? Let us look at the four principles I\r\n\r\nmentioned.  Meritocracy is a means to an end.  It helps  achieve\r\n\r\na  stable  and prosperous society.  The other three  principles,\r\n\r\nnamely,  equality  of  opportunity, multi-racialism  and  racial\r\n\r\nharmony  are  both a means to an end, namely our survival  as  a\r\n\r\nnation  as well as being an end in themselves - they are  ideals\r\n\r\nwhich a society should seek to achieve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These principles were constantly drummed into us.\r\n\r\nCommunities,  based  on  race, were changed  to  racially  mixed\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods.  The same happened in schools and  wherever  the\r\n\r\nGovernment had a say.  As a result, we are where we are today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: where are we going from here? It is quite\r\n\r\nclear that looking at the future, no rational person doubts  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  commitment to any of the  four  principles.   That\r\n\r\nmuch  is certain, and I believe it.  However, I have to say that\r\n\r\nthere is some concern among the minority communities about  some\r\n\r\nof  the  Government  policies  and  their  possible  impact,  in\r\n\r\nparticular,  on  the principle of multi-racialism  and  possibly\r\n\r\nequality  of opportunities as we now understand them.  This  may\r\n\r\nbe  sensitive, but we have never shrunk from a frank  debate  on\r\n\r\nGovernment  policies and their impact.  So since there  is  some\r\n\r\nconcern, it is time for a frank debate.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the concern? It is this. The post-independence\r\n\r\ngeneration,  who  are  now in their 30s and  early  40s,  had  a\r\n\r\ncertain  understanding of what multi-racialism meant.  It  meant\r\n\r\nthat the Government would consciously promote togetherness among\r\n\r\nthe races, throw everyone together in schools, in the SAF and at\r\n\r\nthe work place.  We will live together, have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfriends  across  racial  divides, form  deep  friendships,  work\r\n\r\ntogether  and in time, perhaps, forge a deep sense  of  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness  based on those shared memories.   The  Government\r\n\r\nwas  seen as the key to avoiding any sort of development of  our\r\n\r\nsociety along communal lines.  In fact, the Government was  seen\r\n\r\nat  the  forefront  of  breaking up development  along  communal\r\n\r\nlines.   I  do not say that multi-racialism can only mean  that.\r\n\r\nHowever,  that was how the practical application of the  concept\r\n\r\nwas  understood,  at least by some, and was  backed  by  a  high\r\n\r\ndegree of symbolism on the unity among the races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, let us see the changes that have been\r\n\r\ntaking  place over the last few years, and their possible impact\r\n\r\non  our  existing  understanding of multi-racialism.   Take  the\r\n\r\nschool  system.  The structure of the school system now is  such\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  possible for very bright Chinese students  not  to\r\n\r\nreally mix, on a daily basis, in schools with students from  the\r\n\r\nminority communities.  They could go through 12 years of  formal\r\n\r\neducation like that.  By the time they get to National  Service,\r\n\r\ntheir  views would have been relatively formed.  They are  going\r\n\r\nto  be  among the policy formulator of the future - the men  and\r\n\r\nthe women who are going to make this place tick.  What would  be\r\n\r\ntheir  understanding of multi-racialism if they did not have  an\r\n\r\nadequate opportunity to mix on a daily basis, as students,  with\r\n\r\nmembers  of  other  races?  Whatever  we  say,  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nundeniable  that  their  empathy,  their  understanding  of  the\r\n\r\nminority   communities  would  be  less  than  that   of   their\r\n\r\npredecessors  who grew up in schools with members of  the  other\r\n\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us also consider the policy to create cultural elites\r\n\r\nalong   communal  lines.   It  will  succeed  with  the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.  However, let us be frank.  Is it really going to  be\r\n\r\npossible to create such elites among, say, the Indian community?\r\n\r\nIts  small  size would mean no significant cultural elite  would\r\n\r\nemerge   and  even  if  it  did  emerge,  the  Singapore  Indian\r\n\r\npopulation  base  would  be too small to support  that  cultural\r\n\r\nelite.  That is easy enough to predict.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we talk about developing cultural elites, in\r\n\r\npractical  terms,  we  are  really talking  about  developing  a\r\n\r\nChinese  cultural  elite  as  a matter  of  official  Government\r\n\r\npolicy.  That is not to say that because there can be no  Indian\r\n\r\ncultural  elite,  there should also not be  a  Chinese  cultural\r\n\r\nelite.  That is nonsense.  What I am saying is that whenever  we\r\n\r\ntalk  about developing cultural elites, everyone should be clear\r\n\r\nabout  what it really means, so that we can again have  a  frank\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the impact of these two polices and others like\r\n\r\nthem?   They  would not suggest any change to the commitment  to\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism as a concept.  However, over time, in  practical\r\n\r\nterms,  there  could be a development of elites  along  communal\r\n\r\nlines.   It could also lead to a situation where the top 30%  of\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  population, the people who will  run  this  place,\r\n\r\nhaving  a  lesser  empathy with the minority races.   That  will\r\n\r\nrepresent  a  significant  change  in  how  the  minority  races\r\n\r\nunderstand   multi-racialism  and  the  Government's   role   in\r\n\r\nfostering  it.   Should we go down that path?   Since  any  such\r\n\r\nchange would be seen as deep lasting, there should be a thorough\r\n\r\ndebate on it so that everyone understands that position.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can see the rationale for such policies. It is\r\n\r\npossible  to  argue that for Singapore to survive, it  would  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  society to have deep cultural  roots.   The\r\n\r\nonslaught   of   different   cultural   values   is   increasing\r\n\r\ntremendously,  and it can be argued that the Chinese,  who  form\r\n\r\nthe  overwhelming  majority, have to  anchor  this  country  and\r\n\r\nprovide the bulwark against disintegration.  If that is so, then\r\n\r\nit  is best to have that articulated clearly.  It must mean that\r\n\r\nwe  redefine the debate in terms of national survival.  We  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  say  that  it is necessary now to pursue  policies  in\r\n\r\neducation   and  culture  which  may  result  in   creating   an\r\n\r\nenvironment  which is more communal at least  among  the  middle\r\n\r\nclasses, and we will have to say that that is necessary  because\r\n\r\nthe  very  survival of our society, as a society, is  at  stake.\r\n\r\nThat is an argument that rational members of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nminority  communities can understand, whether or not they  agree\r\n\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it should be a debate which leads to an\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of what is needed for our survival.   Without  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding, you will have a situation where the policy makers\r\n\r\nproceed   on  the  basis  of  overriding  concern  for  national\r\n\r\nsurvival,  whereas the minority communities, and  in  particular\r\n\r\nthe  middle  classes, will be perplexed because those Government\r\n\r\npolicies which are being introduced, appear at variance with the\r\n\r\nunderstanding of what multi-racialism, and the Government's role\r\n\r\nin  fostering it, really is.  There will be no meeting of  minds\r\n\r\nbecause  the parties will be arguing from different standpoints.\r\n\r\nThe letter by AMP in today's papers is one such example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any redefinition of the social compact would have a deep\r\n\r\nlasting  impact.   It  must be a matter for any  Singaporean  to\r\n\r\nthink  carefully about, because what we are really talking about\r\n\r\nis the social framework within which our children will live.  In\r\n\r\nthat  context,  if we are prepared to see a development  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  along more communal lines, while we will still  adhere\r\n\r\nto  the principle of multi-racialism, then so be it.  But let us\r\n\r\ntalk  frankly about it and whether such a development is  really\r\n\r\nnecessary for national survival.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am calling again\r\n\r\nfor the abolition or, if the Government is not willing, then the\r\n\r\nsuspension  of  the Internal Security Act (ISA).   The  ISA  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  by  the British first as an emergency 1measure  when\r\n\r\nthere  was  a communist armed uprising in Malaysia in  or  about\r\n\r\n1948, and then it was enacted as a formal law in the 1960s.  The\r\n\r\nISA was targeted against the communists and their supporters who\r\n\r\nadvocated  overthrowing  the legitimate  government  by  violent\r\n\r\nmeans.  There was a justification in maintaining the ISA in  the\r\n\r\n1950s,  the  1960s  and even the 1970s.  But in  the  1980s  the\r\n\r\nsocial,  political  and  economic  situation  in  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nmarkedly  changed.  In the 1980s onwards, the Singapore  society\r\n\r\nwas  more  settled.   The problem of race,  language,  religion,\r\n\r\nunemployment and housing had been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbasically  solved.  There was full employment and Singapore  had\r\n\r\nbecome  a property-owning nation.  Under the circumstances,  the\r\n\r\nISA  stands out like a sore thumb, especially today.  It  is  an\r\n\r\nanomaly  in a civil society where the Government is vested  with\r\n\r\nsuch  draconian  powers.  The ISA gives the power  of  arbitrary\r\n\r\narrests to the Government without the necessity of charging  the\r\n\r\nperson arrested or bringing him to a court to be tried.  It is a\r\n\r\nblatant violation of human rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we mention the ISA in Singapore, one name comes to mind,\r\n\r\nand  he  is Chia Thye Poh, who has been imprisoned for 23  years\r\n\r\nunder  the  ISA from 1966.  Chia was never formally  charged  or\r\n\r\nbrought to a court for trial.  There is only an allegation  that\r\n\r\nhe  was a communist and that he called for violent overthrow  of\r\n\r\nthe elected government of the day, which he persistently denied.\r\n\r\nEven  up  till today, I believe Chia has not signed a confession\r\n\r\nor  any  statement admitting that he is a communist or advocated\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a pity that the Government, when it releases detainees\r\n\r\nunder  the  ISA,  still attaches conditions and restrictions  on\r\n\r\nthem,  which make it difficult for them to seek employment.   As\r\n\r\nan  Opposition Member, I am particularly concerned that the  ISA\r\n\r\nshould  still  be  strongly entrenched.  The very  fact  of  its\r\n\r\nexistence and mere threat of its possible implementation by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment make very well-meaning professionals from joining the\r\n\r\nOpposition  and take part in the elections on the  side  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.   This  is  a  pity,  because  it  will  impede  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  progress  of Singapore.   Singapore  shall  then\r\n\r\nforever  remain  a paternalistic authoritarian state  where  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of stagnation, rather than progress, shall  be  the\r\n\r\norder of the day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Singapore, being an urban society endowed with\r\n\r\nwidespread education and lack of illiteracy and a thick layer of\r\n\r\nproperty-owning middle class, perhaps has the greatest chance of\r\n\r\nsucceeding  in  transforming our society  into  a  western  type\r\n\r\ndemocratic country with modifications, of course, to suit our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlocal  conditions.  In such an environment, if it should happen,\r\n\r\npeople  can  work and live peacefully in a more  open  political\r\n\r\ncondition  where  the  arts  and  culture  could  flourish,  and\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are given opportunities to become more creative and\r\n\r\ninnovative  and  where  our  economy  would  produce  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices with more value-added due to the added creative element\r\n\r\nto  bring greater profits and income to our people, so  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  maintain  a  higher standard of living as compared  to  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's aim is to achieve such a democratic society\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore, then it must make up its mind to  dismantle  the\r\n\r\nISA.   If the Government wants to be cautious and is not willing\r\n\r\nto  take such a bold step, then I call on the Government  to  at\r\n\r\nleast  suspend the ISA, say, for a period of two years,  and  if\r\n\r\nnothing untoward happens in those two years, to suspend it for a\r\n\r\nfurther  two  years  and so on, until the day  when  it  can  be\r\n\r\ntotally  taken  off our statute books.  On the  other  hand,  if\r\n\r\nsomething  bad does happen, the Government can easily  lift  the\r\n\r\nsuspension  and  make the ISA in force once again.   If  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  does arise, I myself do not think it shall be  caused\r\n\r\nfrom within but rather from without.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the feeling of Singaporeans towards the ISA, I believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  majority of them want the ISA removed.   Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwant  this troublesome baggage manifested in the ISA be a  relic\r\n\r\nof  times  gone  by,  to be left behind  as  we  enter  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, women are under-represented in this House would, I think, be an understatement.\r\n\r\nIn  many  countries,  the  women  are  clamouring  for  adequate\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.

It is  an  important\r\n\r\nvalue which has made our civil service an example to emulate for\r\n\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, meritocracy is a fundamental philosophy and we should\r\n\r\nadhere to it at all costs.  Never allow foreign or local element\r\n\r\nto  endanger this basic philosophy.  If we allow quotas for  the\r\n\r\ncivil service, we are finished.  The best men must come in, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that there should be GRCs and multi-racial\r\n\r\nrepresentation in Parliament.  By the very nature of society, we\r\n\r\nwill  choose the best from each community.  But to say that  you\r\n\r\nmust be in the civil\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice and promoted because of your race is a dangerous trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have set a very high standard for the civil service\r\n\r\nand  it must be so.  As I said earlier, the political leadership\r\n\r\nand  the  civil service work hand-in-hand.  I have two proposals\r\n\r\nfor the Government.  First, we should try to attract some of the\r\n\r\nbest  brains from the private sector for a short-term  stint  in\r\n\r\nthe  Administrative  Service.  Similarly, we  should  allow  our\r\n\r\ncivil  servants, not just in the statutory board and Government-linked  companies, to go for a short stint in the private sector\r\n\r\nas  well.  I think this process will benefit both the economy as\r\n\r\nwell as the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, in\r\n\r\nmoving  this amendment, I am of course pursuing what I  said  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  speech yesterday, and it was the cost of  governing\r\n\r\nus,  which I said the budget estimated at about $14 billion.   I\r\n\r\nraised  the  question of the money spent in the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice  last year.  But I do not think I got any answer.   So  I\r\n\r\nwonder whether we can get an answer this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see from the estimates that the expenditure on political\r\n\r\nmanpower  has  increased  by some $428,400.   That  is  possibly\r\n\r\nbecause,  last year, there was no provision for Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  and Minister of State.  At least the posts  were  not\r\n\r\nfilled.   I suppose, this year, it looks as though there  is  an\r\n\r\nintention to fill these posts.  The result is that we would have\r\n\r\nabout   five  Ministers,  two  Ministers  of  State,  a   Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary and two Political Secretaries.  I do not\r\n\r\nintend  to  read  the  work programme of  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice.  But if one reads it, one is led to ask the question: do\r\n\r\nwe  really  need four Ministers and two Ministers  of  State  to\r\n\r\nadminister this programme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would ask the Prime Minister if he would be good enough to\r\n\r\ntell  us  exactly  the  functions and duties  of  these  various\r\n\r\nMinisters  in  his  Department.   What  is  it  that  they   are\r\n\r\noverseeing?   What  is it that they are doing that  deserve  the\r\n\r\nsalaries that they are paid?  The public has a right\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  know  what  is it that they are getting for  what  they  are\r\n\r\npaying.   So  I  hope we will hear from the Prime  Minister  the\r\n\r\nfunctions and duties of the Ministers in his office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, if you will permit me and if there is time, say a\r\n\r\nlittle bit on the amendment moved by Mr Simon Tay?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, under the rule of debate in\r\n\r\nthe  Committee  of Supply, could you restrict  yourself  to  the\r\n\r\ntopic that you have indicated you are speaking on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I see.

Dr Tan Boon Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, the Public Service\r\n\r\nCommission  administers  the stable of Government  scholarships.\r\n\r\nTo  get a feel of the requirements of these scholarships let  me\r\n\r\nread   out,  that  of  the  most  prestigious,  the  President's\r\n\r\nScholarship:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Be Singapore citizens or children of Singapore citizens;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have offered four `A' level subjects and two `S' papers, if\r\n\r\nthey are in the Science/Commerce Stream;  and at least three `A'\r\n\r\nlevel  subjects, an `AO' subject and one `S' paper, if they  are\r\n\r\nin the Arts Stream, at the GCE `A' level examination;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have outstanding GCE `O' level and `A' level results with at\r\n\r\nleast three `A' level distinctions or equivalent qualification;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have taken SAT1;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have very good extra-curricular activities record; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have strong leadership qualities and impeccable character.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is very strong emphasis on academic excellence and this is\r\n\r\nhow  the  public  perceives PSC to award the scholarships.   You\r\n\r\nwill find the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemphasis  in the requirements of the other scholarships  in  the\r\n\r\nstable.  The difference lies in the required number of subjects,\r\n\r\npapers  or  distinctions.   Many  scholarships  offered  by  the\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and companies use these Government scholarships\r\n\r\nas the base to formulate their own.  These scholarships are very\r\n\r\nmuch  sought  after.   Parents  glamorise  the  scholarships  to\r\n\r\ninterest  and motivate their children to strive for them.   Each\r\n\r\nyear, I believe, thousands of students, especially the brightest\r\n\r\nin the land, apply for them.  Many more thousands aspire for the\r\n\r\nscholarships but do not do well enough to apply.  These students\r\n\r\nprepare  themselves for years to meet these requirements,  their\r\n\r\nattitude rubbing off on their fellow students in schools.  These\r\n\r\nscholarship requirements thus profoundly affect what and how our\r\n\r\nchildren, especially our brightest, learn in school.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last two days, much has been said in this House about our\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  future,  the  importance  of   creativity   and\r\n\r\ninnovation  to such a future and the need for a mindset  change.\r\n\r\nWe  tell our parents that we are preparing for such a future  by\r\n\r\nmaking  changes to our schools to encourage more creativity  and\r\n\r\ninnovative spirit.  Some parents are sceptical, pointing to  the\r\n\r\nmismatch  between this over-emphasis on academic  excellence  in\r\n\r\nthe scholarship and the call to our children to be more creative\r\n\r\nand  innovative.  Since the Government scholarships have such  a\r\n\r\nstrong  influence on the mindsets of our young, may I  urge  the\r\n\r\nPSC  to  review our scholarship policies to reflect the  growing\r\n\r\nimportance of creativity and innovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir, let me\r\n\r\ntake the points raised by the MPs one by one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr Simon Tay suggested that the Government should\r\n\r\nmonitor  discrimination and make sure that it does not become  a\r\n\r\nproblem, especially discrimination in jobs.  We are doing  this.\r\n\r\nI  agree  with him that the correct approach is not  legislation\r\n\r\nbecause  you  cannot legislate preference.   Personal  contracts\r\n\r\nand  jobs are very much personal choices; whom you want to hire,\r\n\r\nwhom you do not want to hire.  You cannot cause a person to hire\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomebody else whom he does not want.  But we can set the  social\r\n\r\nclimate  so  as to encourage people to look at them  objectively\r\n\r\nand not go on race or ethnic prejudices or biases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested to know that in fact we are working\r\n\r\nout  some  tripartite guidelines on recruitment practices.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower has been discussing  this  together  with\r\n\r\nSNEF, the employers' federation, and NTUC, the trade unions, and\r\n\r\nthey will be publishing their guidelines within a few days.   It\r\n\r\nis  not  a  matter  which can be resolved by  publication  of  a\r\n\r\ndocument.  But I think a cumulative series of gestures and moves\r\n\r\nlike  this  over a period of time will help to shape the  social\r\n\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Simon Tay asked about self-help groups and whether\r\n\r\nthey  could be encouraged to do more joint activities.  In fact,\r\n\r\nthey  do.   For example, CDAC, Mendaki, the Eurasian Association\r\n\r\nand  SINDA run a joint social service centre in Toa Payoh, which\r\n\r\nused  to be a community centre.  The community centre has  moved\r\n\r\nand they have renovated the old building.  They jointly run this\r\n\r\nsocial   service  centre.   And  they  also  have  other   joint\r\n\r\nactivities  regularly, for example, when we have community  days\r\n\r\nor  multi-cultural days, the self-help groups get  together.   I\r\n\r\nthink they can do somewhat more because there will be times when\r\n\r\nyou  will have economies of scale, for example, running  tuition\r\n\r\nclasses or providing services, and we will encourage them to  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shanmugam raised a basic question about our multi-racial\r\n\r\npolicies  and  whether our emphasis on SAP schools and  cultural\r\n\r\nelites  runs  against  this and may cause  us  problems  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture, and he gave the example of how people who grow up in SAP\r\n\r\nschools now will be different from the earlier post-independence\r\n\r\ngeneration who grew up in fully integrated schools.  I think  we\r\n\r\nshould cast our discussion in the framework of the situation  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Where did we come from?  Where are we today?  We did\r\n\r\nnot  start  off a homogeneous society.  We are not a homogeneous\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  fact, our starting point was schools  which  were\r\n\r\nvery substantially differentiated and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsegregated, because many of the Chinese were in Chinese schools,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  Malay  children were in Malay  schools,  and  the\r\n\r\nEnglish schools catered to a minority of the population.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversity can be a problem. But in our case, as we have brought\r\n\r\nthese  communities  closer together it  has  been  a  source  of\r\n\r\nstrength.   And  as I have explained during the debate  here  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  on  Chinese language, the fact that we have people  who\r\n\r\nhave come from Chinese school backgrounds like Hwa Chong, people\r\n\r\nwho  have come from English school backgrounds like RI and  ACS,\r\n\r\npeople with strong Malay roots or strong Indian roots, makes  us\r\n\r\na  diverse society with different strengths which are useful  in\r\n\r\ndifferent situations and the whole together is stronger than any\r\n\r\nsingle one of the parts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diversity is a major factor for our national survival.\r\n\r\nIf we were all homogenized together, not only do the communities\r\n\r\nnot  want  it, because actually each community wants  to  retain\r\n\r\nsome  of  its own identity, but we would be the weaker  for  it.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  what we are trying to do is to retain  some  of  the\r\n\r\nstrengths  of  these different ethnic groups and these  cultural\r\n\r\ntraditions,  while  at  the  same time  building  a  Singaporean\r\n\r\nidentity.  Not all of the top 30% of Chinese students attend SAP\r\n\r\nschools.  For a start, RI and ACS would claim that they are  any\r\n\r\ntime  as good as Hwa Chong, and even apart from that, if we take\r\n\r\nall  the  SAP schools as a whole, perhaps about 15%  of  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents  will be there.  Many good Chinese students do  not  go\r\n\r\ninto  SAP  schools; but we want some of them to go  through  SAP\r\n\r\nschools,  because we think that there is something  valuable  in\r\n\r\nthe tradition of the SAP schools which we should try our best to\r\n\r\npreserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are really preserving in a new situation, something which\r\n\r\ngrew  out  of  specific historical circumstances of  the  period\r\n\r\nafter  the  war  in a different Singapore.  We  are  not  really\r\n\r\nadvancing  the  margins.  We are just trying to  maintain  in  a\r\n\r\ntransmuted form part of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhat  was  good of the previous generation.  So, our society  is\r\n\r\nnot  becoming more and more segregated.  It is society  actually\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  and more unified but yet in unity,  we  want  to\r\n\r\npreserve some of these strengths.  Between what we are doing and\r\n\r\nthe  extreme  possibility which Mr Shanmugam  has  presented,  I\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  a considerable difference which  is  not  just\r\n\r\nquantitative but becomes qualitative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a trade-off, of course. It is not the same, learning\r\n\r\nabout  other  cultures vicarously, as it is having  a  class  of\r\n\r\nmixed  students  -  Malays, Chinese, Indians and  Eurasians  all\r\n\r\ntogether, having to accommodate one another.  But given that SAP\r\n\r\nschools are something which we want to maintain, there are  ways\r\n\r\nwe  can work to minimise the disadvantages.  For example, we are\r\n\r\npressing  national education in the schools, both in the  formal\r\n\r\nas  well  as  in  the  informal curriculum, to  bring  home  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of multi-racial harmony, and to organise  activities\r\n\r\nand  programmes which register this message not just  on  paper,\r\n\r\nbut   through   actual  participation  and   experience,   joint\r\n\r\nactivities  with  other  schools,  opportunities  to  mix   with\r\n\r\nstudents  of other schools, so that they could get to  know  one\r\n\r\nanother.   And  some of the SAP schools have regular  activities\r\n\r\nwhich   involve  the  minority  cultural  groups.  For  example,\r\n\r\nCatholic High School regularly invites Malay and Indian cultural\r\n\r\ngroups  to  perform or give talks during appropriate  festivals.\r\n\r\nAnd  as  I  also  mentioned in January, Nanyang Junior  College,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  going  to  have  a second Chinese  language  elective\r\n\r\nprogramme, hosts annually a Tamil Drama Festival and it also has\r\n\r\na  very active dikir barat group.  It is a junior college  which\r\n\r\nhas   multi-racial  students  and  even  with  the  Chinese  LEP\r\n\r\nprogramme  there,  I  hope  that  Nanyang  Junior  College  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to promote the Malay and Indian cultural activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the SAP schools are now using English as the medium of\r\n\r\ninstruction.  They are teaching Chinese at a higher  level  than\r\n\r\nother schools, and with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngreater cultural content, but the main medium of instruction  is\r\n\r\nEnglish.   The  difference between a SAP school  student  and  a\r\n\r\nstudent  who went to Hwa Chong and Chung Cheng or Catholic  High\r\n\r\n30  years  ago, is that, now they speak the language  using  the\r\n\r\nsame textbooks as students who go to SCGS or RGS, or any of  the\r\n\r\nother English schools.  So the gap is much less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, MOE is clustering the schools. We are going to group\r\n\r\nseven  or  nine  schools together in one  cluster  for  all  the\r\n\r\nschools  in  Singapore  so that there  is  greater  sharing  and\r\n\r\ninteraction  between them.  SAP schools will be  part  of  these\r\n\r\nclusters  and these clusters will have other non-SAP schools  in\r\n\r\nthem. There will be frequent joint activities with other schools\r\n\r\nin the same cluster.  So, you are within the same family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, SAP schools are not the end of a person's formative\r\n\r\nexperience.  They go on to junior college, to national  service,\r\n\r\nto  work and to university, and there they will learn to mix and\r\n\r\nwork  together  and  to relate to Singaporeans,  whatever  their\r\n\r\nethnic  group.  And feedback from our junior college  principals\r\n\r\nhas  confirmed that in fact the SAP school students have not had\r\n\r\na  problem  mixing with other non-SAP school students.   But  we\r\n\r\nwill  continue to keep the situation under close review and help\r\n\r\ncreate  more  opportunities,  and we  welcome  suggestions  from\r\n\r\nMembers as to how we can do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong advocated abolishing or suspending the ISA.\r\n\r\nHe  says that we should become a western style of democracy with\r\n\r\nmodifications,   then   arts   and   culture,   innovation   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship will bloom.  I do not believe that  anybody  is\r\n\r\nrestrained from trying to make a fortune in Singapore  for  fear\r\n\r\nthat  if he does so, he will be arrested under the ISA.  If only\r\n\r\nit  was so simple to cause arts and culture to bloom.  There are\r\n\r\nmany  countries  without any internal security type  legislation\r\n\r\nwho would now be flowering in every direction today.  But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so.  The ISA is a safeguard which we have had and which  we\r\n\r\nhave  kept  for  many years now and used very lightly  and  been\r\n\r\naccepted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans as something which is necessary as part of  our\r\n\r\npolitical landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam said that Singaporeans want this removed, but he did\r\n\r\nnot  make it an election issue in the General Elections.   Other\r\n\r\npeople  who have made it an issue in the General Elections  have\r\n\r\nlost.   One of them who made it an issue was Mr Francis Seow  in\r\n\r\n1988,  after he had been arrested under the ISA and released  in\r\n\r\ntime  to  take part in the elections.  And when he  went  around\r\n\r\nEunos making speeches, it was quite instructive.  He did not say\r\n\r\nthat  we  should abolish the ISA.  He said, \"I do not object  to\r\n\r\nthe  ISA but the PAP Government has misused it.\" He did  not  do\r\n\r\nthat  to  support the PAP Government or to support the ISA.   He\r\n\r\ndid  that  because he thought that that  was  the  best  way  to\r\n\r\ncollect  as many votes as possible.  I do not think anybody  can\r\n\r\nsay that the ISA has no political support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chia Thye Poh who was under detention for many years, Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  See Tong said that he has never been charged and that  he\r\n\r\nis  an  innocent man.  Mr Chiam should read the statements which\r\n\r\nwe  have put out which had explained how communist cadres in  Mr\r\n\r\nChia's chain of command, direct line of authority over Mr  Chia,\r\n\r\nhave  told  us  that,  \"Yes, he was my subordinate.\"   And  much\r\n\r\nlater, a very senior communist cadre, who came back and whom ISD\r\n\r\ndebriefed, confirmed, that \"Yes, he was one of our men.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allegations of Mr Chia inciting violence are not matters of\r\n\r\nopinion.   He  made these speeches and one of the  speeches  was\r\n\r\npublished in a left wing trade union journal.  He was  not  just\r\n\r\nan  anti-Vietnam  war  peacenik.  He was saying,  \"Do  like  the\r\n\r\nVietnamese.   They  have armed revolution.  Our  conditions  are\r\n\r\nsimilar.\"  Let  us  also  have armed revolution.  That  was  the\r\n\r\nimplication. These facts have not been rebutted.   He  said,  \"I\r\n\r\nhave  not  been charged in court.\"  But he did not say  that  he\r\n\r\nnever said that, because it was published.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Thye Poh, you might say that was many years ago. The\r\n\r\nproblem of the communists or the marxists is much less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnow  because  communism has collapsed in Russia, in  the  former\r\n\r\nSoviet Union, and China does not present the same sort of threat\r\n\r\nas  before.  But there remain problems.  In 1987, Mr  Chiam  may\r\n\r\nremember,  we arrested under the ISA four people, a Silat  group\r\n\r\nwho  had been stockpiling weapons, headbands, and they had  come\r\n\r\nin  and  were  preparing to mount a riot.   If  I  have  such  a\r\n\r\nsituation, do I want to go through the motions of activating the\r\n\r\nISA which is suspended before I arrest them?  Can I wait till  I\r\n\r\nget  enough  evidence in order to be able to prove the  case  in\r\n\r\ncourt?   Or  do  I  want to act immediately and  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem before it has gone out of hand?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1987 is not very long ago, but it was not the last case. When\r\n\r\nMr  Simon  Tay asked the question of how many people  have  been\r\n\r\narrested under the ISA, year by year over the last few years, he\r\n\r\nexpected  us  to say zero after 1987/1988.  And I think  he  was\r\n\r\nsurprised  to  discover that there were  cases  in  1997  -  two\r\n\r\npersons  in 1998 - four persons, who were arrested and  detained\r\n\r\nfor  espionage.  We have not published a lot of details on these\r\n\r\nespionage cases because we do not want to unnecessarily  inflame\r\n\r\nrelations and cause a public problem with countries or  agencies\r\n\r\nwhich might have been involved.  But these are real cases and  I\r\n\r\nhave  consulted the Minister for Home Affairs just  now,  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to say that any MP who does not take my word for  it\r\n\r\nbut  would  like  to know more about these cases,  whether  PAP,\r\n\r\nOpposition,  NMP  or  NCMP, could come  and  sign  the  Official\r\n\r\nSecrets Act, and we will give you a fuller briefing of what  the\r\n\r\n1997 and 1998 cases were about, and you will know that these are\r\n\r\nreal  cases.   They happen today.  We are not in  toyland  where\r\n\r\neverybody can be taken at face value and all is well.  While you\r\n\r\nmaintain the smiles and a certain facade of normalcy, a  certain\r\n\r\namount  of cloak and dagger skulduggery continues all the  time.\r\n\r\nAnd  that is one of the reasons, not the only one, why we  still\r\n\r\ncontinue to need the ISA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Shriniwas Rai asked whether we are not under-represented with\r\n\r\nwomen and whether we could not have some more in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  House.   I heartily support his sentiments.   We  have  six\r\n\r\nwomen in Parliament now including two Nominated MPs.  I wish  we\r\n\r\ncould  find more.  But it is not very easy.  If you compare  our\r\n\r\nexperience  with other countries, we have about  6.5-7%  of  our\r\n\r\nlegislature  who are women.  Most other countries, even  in  the\r\n\r\nWest,  only  managed 10-15% of women in their legislatures.  For\r\n\r\nexample, in the United States and most of Europe, except Britain\r\n\r\nwhich, this time with the Labour Party, has brought in many  new\r\n\r\nwomen  MPs.  The only exceptions are the Scandinavian countries,\r\n\r\nSweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland which have 30-40% - plus women,\r\n\r\nbut they are a totally different sort of society than we are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty of getting women into Parliament reflects\r\n\r\nsomething quite deeply structured within our society.  We should\r\n\r\ntry  to overcome this problem but I would be doubtful if  it  is\r\n\r\nwise  or  possible to turn our society upside down  and  try  to\r\n\r\nemulate the Scandinavian model.  Various countries have tried to\r\n\r\nlegislate  to overcome this problem.  He mentioned  India.   The\r\n\r\nFrench are also thinking about 1this matter and in fact they are\r\n\r\nthinking  about a constitutional amendment, a parity  amendment,\r\n\r\nwhich  will  favour  equal access by men and  women  to  elected\r\n\r\noffice.  It is very vague, but if they have that amendment, then\r\n\r\nthey may have laws with quotas and rules and require parties  to\r\n\r\nfill  40%  women,  and so on.  But it is quite instructive  that\r\n\r\nsome  feminists in France are against this idea.  You would have\r\n\r\nthought  that  feminists  want to be upfront  and  demand  their\r\n\r\nrights and have their percentage, and one per GRC.  But this  is\r\n\r\nnot  so.   And  one  of them, I quote from International  Herald\r\n\r\nTribune, March 3rd by Elisabeth Badinter, is against this.   She\r\n\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Parity is not a political matter, it is above all a matter of\r\n\r\nprinciple,  of philosophy. The ideology of quotas breeds  sordid\r\n\r\nand  humiliating  calculations.  Does  it  need  repeating  that\r\n\r\npolitics is above all an ideological choice that has nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo with sexual specificity?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is speaking about the French situation but I think what she\r\n\r\nsays is correct, and we have to accept this.  We cannot overcome\r\n\r\nthis  problem  with  quotas or by a forced arrangement.  As  our\r\n\r\nsociety evolves gradually, it may become easier.  There are more\r\n\r\nwomen  professionals  now  and  perhaps,  as  men  become   more\r\n\r\nenlightened  and  play  a greater role in  looking  after  their\r\n\r\nchildren and families and do their shopping, cooking and washing\r\n\r\nup,  a few more women will be found in Parliament.  We will  try\r\n\r\nour  best to find a few more by the next elections, and  I  hope\r\n\r\nMembers will help us.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mr Shriniwas Rai's other question on the civil\r\n\r\nservice  where he strongly opposed ethnic quotas, and I  presume\r\n\r\nalso  sex quotas as well, I agree with his views.  We also place\r\n\r\ngreat  store   on  the independence of the public  service,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  key  role of the Public  Service  Commission  in\r\n\r\nensuring this.  And we have entrenched the position of  the  PSC\r\n\r\nin  our  system  by  requiring  Presidential  approval  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the Chairman and members of the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  and  making  sure  that  however  we  devolve   the\r\n\r\nauthority and responsibility for personnel management within the\r\n\r\ncivil  service,  finally, the authority runs back  to  the  PSC.\r\n\r\nThere  is  an appeal to the PSC and there is a safeguard  there.\r\n\r\nThese  checks and balances will continue to ensure the integrity\r\n\r\nof  the  civil  service, recruitment, appointment and  promotion\r\n\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member's two specific suggestions to improve the\r\n\r\nquality  of  the civil service: (1) to recruit from the  private\r\n\r\nsector  on short-term contracts; and (2) to allow civil servants\r\n\r\nto  be posted out to the private sector; I agree with both.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  are  trying to do both, but it is  not  easy  to  do,\r\n\r\nbecause there is a cultural difference between the civil service\r\n\r\nand  the private sector, and it is not quite easy to bridge that\r\n\r\ngap.   We  have to try, but we have had a small number  of  mid-career entrants; currently, two from the private sector, and  we\r\n\r\nwill  also  be sending out civil servants to the private  sector\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattachments and secondment.  We have done a few but we  will  do\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out, however, that the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\nin  charge of personnel visited the New Zealanders who are  also\r\n\r\ntrying  to  grapple with this problem, and they  also  have  not\r\n\r\nfound it easy to cross over this way and bring people in.   They\r\n\r\ntold  him  something very interesting, which is  that  when  you\r\n\r\nbring  people in, for the first two years, they are very useful,\r\n\r\nbecause they still retain their private sector mindsets.   After\r\n\r\ntwo  years, they begin to think like civil servants and they are\r\n\r\nnot  unique  any  more.  So, these are matters of organisational\r\n\r\nculture which we gradually have to overcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam asked about running costs of the Government,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  $14  billion.  He asked why is it  so  much.   It  is\r\n\r\nactually very little because $14 billion is less than 10% of our\r\n\r\nGDP.   Our total budget expenditure is about 16-17% of our  GDP,\r\n\r\neven  including  development expenditure, and it  compares  with\r\n\r\ncountries spending 30% of their GDP on the public sector in  the\r\n\r\nWest.  In Europe, it is probably 50%.  In Scandinavia, maybe 55-60%.   I  think  at 16-17% of the GDP, we are really  not  doing\r\n\r\nbadly.   I  am  not  saying that we cannot do better  and  every\r\n\r\ndollar  is  spent optimally.  As Mr Lim Swee Say  said,  we  can\r\n\r\nalways squeeze a bit harder and make some savings and do better.\r\n\r\nWe will try.  But I would say that, overall, we are not absurdly\r\n\r\nout of line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of percentage of the labour force which the Government\r\n\r\naccounts for, we are one of the lowest in the world.  I  have  a\r\n\r\ntable which shows that only 31/2% of the labour force is in  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service  in  Singapore.  The only country  with  a  lower\r\n\r\npercentage  is Japan, which is 3.2%, but they have  130  million\r\n\r\npeople as a denominator.  Even Hong Kong, which you have thought\r\n\r\nwould  have a small civil service, has 5.6% of the labour  force\r\n\r\nin  the civil service.  Malaysia has 10% and the UK has  9%.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that,  overall, we are not bloated.  There  are  specific\r\n\r\nareas  to focus on and these are matters which we will  have  to\r\n\r\nlook  into.  The details of where we spend this $14 billion  are\r\n\r\nfully given in the Budget book.  I do not understand why the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMember  said he does not know where the money is spent.   If  he\r\n\r\nlooks there, he will see who has been allocated how much and for\r\n\r\nwhich Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member asked about the Ministers in the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office  and why there are so  many.   If  I  may  be\r\n\r\nallowed to list them, first, the Prime Minister himself, who,  I\r\n\r\npresume,  the Member does not question.  Second, is  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister who gives general advice to the Prime Minister and  the\r\n\r\nrest of the Cabinet on many matters.  Thirdly, there is me, whom\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister has tasked with looking after MAS  and  also\r\n\r\ninter-Ministerial  coordination, and  also  answering  questions\r\n\r\nfrom  the Member.  Then there is Mr Lim Boon Heng who is elected\r\n\r\nas  Secretary-General of the NTUC, and the  Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nappointed  him  into the Cabinet, because we want  the  NTUC  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  the national picture and we also want  the  NTUC  to\r\n\r\nhave a voice in the Cabinet.  Then there is Mr Chan Soo Sen  who\r\n\r\nis  looking  after  CDCs.  He is in the  Ministry  of  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and he also has half an appointment  in  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Office,  because  the Prime  Minister  is  taking  a\r\n\r\npersonal  interest in CDCs, because it is his project  which  he\r\n\r\nlaunched.   Then there is Mr Zulkifli Mohamed who  is  Political\r\n\r\nSecretary in NTUC and helps to keep the Prime Minister posted on\r\n\r\nwhat  is happening on the ground in the NTUC.  So, I think  that\r\n\r\neverybody does have a role to play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked about scholarship selection and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are  over emphasising school results  in  selecting\r\n\r\nscholars.   I do not believe so.  It is necessary to  have  good\r\n\r\nschool   results  to  be  considered  as  a  scholar,   because,\r\n\r\nparticularly   for   the  top  scholarships   like   President's\r\n\r\nscholarship, SAF scholarship or the OMS scholars, we are  really\r\n\r\nlooking  for the most promising kids of the generation,  and  to\r\n\r\ninvest  our  hopes  on.  To start off, they need  to  have  good\r\n\r\nschool   results,  but  many  kids  have  good  school  results.\r\n\r\nNowadays,  4As will be 1,000 students; 3As maybe 2,000 students,\r\n\r\nsome phenomenal number.  So, the fact that you have As does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that you will get a scholarship.  The scholarship  depends\r\n\r\non something extra.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1988, the Public Service Commission has been\r\n\r\nsponsoring JC students to sit for the SAT1 and then those who do\r\n\r\nwell  are further sponsored by the PSC to sit for SAT2, as  well\r\n\r\nas  TOEFL.  These are all standardised tests which are  required\r\n\r\nfor  entry into American universities,  and these are additional\r\n\r\ninformation when the PSC assesses the students.  So  it  is  not\r\n\r\njust  your book learning, but also the SAT results which measure\r\n\r\nyour  aptitude,  your  IQ, in a way, whether  you  are  able  to\r\n\r\nreason, to argue, whether you have command of the language,  how\r\n\r\nwell  you  can  make sense of numerical and spatial information.\r\n\r\nBut  even  IQ  is not enough.  Because to win a PSC scholarship,\r\n\r\nespecially  the top ones, we are looking not just for intellect,\r\n\r\nwe are also looking for leadership qualities, character, values,\r\n\r\ninter-personal  and  communication  skills,  and  commitment  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is a subject we had a long discussion on  in  the\r\n\r\nlast Budget debate, as Members will remember.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we want scholars to be adaptable, open to change,\r\n\r\nhandle stress well, and so forth.  It is a very demanding  list.\r\n\r\nSo,  to  select such scholars, PSC will look at the  candidate's\r\n\r\nschool  reports,  his ECA records, and the school  reports,  the\r\n\r\nrating  by  his  principal  and his  teachers  of  his  personal\r\n\r\nattributes, including his leadership ability, his integrity, his\r\n\r\ninter-personal  and communication skills, and  creativity.   PSC\r\n\r\nalso  reviews his ECA records and pays attention to  whether  he\r\n\r\nhas  held leadership positions or made significant contributions\r\n\r\nin   his   extracurricular  activities.   This  is  school-based\r\n\r\ninformation.   But apart from this, the PSC also  requires  each\r\n\r\ncandidate to complete an essay about himself, his values and his\r\n\r\nbeliefs.  And then for the top scholarships, we require them  to\r\n\r\nundergo  an  in-depth  psychological interview,  what  motivates\r\n\r\nthem,  what do they consider important, what are they interested\r\n\r\nin,  what do they want to achieve in life, what has their family\r\n\r\nbackground been, how have they coped with stresses and problems,\r\n\r\nup to that point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the males, we check their national service records\r\n\r\nto determine their attitude and performance in national service.\r\n\r\nOf course, if he is going for an SAF or an SPF scholarship, then\r\n\r\nwe must assess the candidate's command and leadership ability as\r\n\r\nwell.   And  after  assembling all this data, the  PSC  requires\r\n\r\nevery  candidate  to  undergo  a  selection  interview  and  the\r\n\r\nselection board has nine members and is chaired by the  Chairman\r\n\r\nof  the  PSC himself and the other PSC members are on the board,\r\n\r\nplus people from the private sector, plus academicians from  NUS\r\n\r\nand  NTU,  or in the case of SAF and SPF, people from MINDEF  or\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Home Affairs.  I think we are quite rounded  in\r\n\r\nour assessments.  We cannot be absolutely certain because we are\r\n\r\nafter  all  talking about somebody 18 years old and  we  do  not\r\n\r\nquite  know  how  he will develop.  He goes to university,  four\r\n\r\nyears  overseas,  he  gets  new ideas,  his  views  change,  his\r\n\r\nperspective  may change.  Sometimes they come back more  mature,\r\n\r\nsometimes they come back different and we are disappointed.  But\r\n\r\nthese are risks we have to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are absolutely careful and we only want to take people who\r\n\r\nare definitely going to do well, then I think we are going to be\r\n\r\ntoo  risk averse, and we would not find high risk cases,  people\r\n\r\nwho could do well but, on the other hand, who might possibly not\r\n\r\nsucceed.    So what we want to do is to have a system  where  we\r\n\r\nbring in people who are obviously good and, at the same time, we\r\n\r\ntake  reasonable  chance on people who have  a  good  chance  of\r\n\r\nsucceeding, and we also take a chance on people who are  not  in\r\n\r\nthe   conventional  mould  but  have  something  extra  in  some\r\n\r\ndirections, because we would like to include even mavericks into\r\n\r\nour  system.  We are continually refining the process.  We  have\r\n\r\nnot  completed it.  We will probably never complete it,  but  we\r\n\r\nhope  that year by year, we will be able to bring in more talent\r\n\r\nand more people to contribute to the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I seek clarification on the answers\r\n\r\ngiven  by the Deputy Prime Minister?

I think the public would want  to\r\n\r\nknow that.  Why is he being paid by the administration for trade\r\n\r\nunion work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he mentions about the Senior Minister giving advice to\r\n\r\nMinisters.   Do  Ministers still need a nanny  after  all  these\r\n\r\nyears?   And  do  we  still  have to pay  that  amount  for  the\r\n\r\noccasional advice that is given?  Could we have clear answers to\r\n\r\nthese questions?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Lim Boon Heng is a full member of the\r\n\r\nCabinet.

I am not sure how many other Members\r\n\r\nin  this House or how many other persons in Singapore would take\r\n\r\nthat view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I return, Mr Speaker, to a point which Mr Shanmugam raised\r\n\r\nwhich I did not address, which is whether we are only interested\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese elite, or we also would like Malay  and  Indian\r\n\r\nelites   as   well.   As  a  practical  matter,   it   is   most\r\n\r\nstraightforward  to  maintain or to  build  up   Chinese  elite,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  numbers are there.  But as a matter of  principle,\r\n\r\nand  I  think  even  in practice, we want people  from  all  the\r\n\r\ncommunities who master their cultural heritage, who  are  fluent\r\n\r\nin  their own language as well as English, and who will be  able\r\n\r\nto  maintain  that  community  in  Singapore,  not  just  as   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean but perhaps with different ethnic features, but as a\r\n\r\nSingaporean  who  has  got  the heritage  alive  and  continuing\r\n\r\nthrough him.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

No sensible or rational Singaporean will quarrel or\r\n\r\nobject to such allocation for defence.  All one has to do is  to\r\n\r\nconsider  and  survey  the Asia-Pacific region  since  the  last\r\n\r\nbudget  debate we have in this House.  It is a region beset  and\r\n\r\nriddled by economic and political crisis of one kind or another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now too familiar with such terms as economic\r\n\r\nmeltdown,  political upheaval, street riots,  currency  turmoil,\r\n\r\nand collapse or near-collapse of governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primordial forces have been unleashed. Fault lines have\r\n\r\nsurfaced.   There  is  concern over possible  waves  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common-sense dictates that we must have a strong defence\r\n\r\ncapability.  Otherwise, we would be vulnerable.  We would be  at\r\n\r\nthe  mercy or whim and fancy of others, and then posterity would\r\n\r\njudge  us:  that  we  have  failed in our  duty  to  our  fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that without a strong defence, there would\r\n\r\nnot be a Singapore.  We would not be able to uphold and preserve\r\n\r\nour  Singaporean  way of life.  The time of regional  crisis,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  is  also a time of reflection, a time of  bonding  and\r\n\r\nindeed  a time of commitment.  I am sure our national servicemen\r\n\r\nwill  train even harder; that there is bonding across all ranks;\r\n\r\nand there is a greater sense of camaraderie\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  purpose.   We  can  also use this  period  to  sharpen  our\r\n\r\ncompetitive edge in defence technology and operational skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If what is around us in the region is not obvious, we can\r\n\r\nlearn from Machiavelli, the 16th  Century strategist from Italy,\r\n\r\nwho studied the unfortunate fate of unprepared city states.  His\r\n\r\nconclusion:  \"The  foundation of a  state  is  a  good  military\r\n\r\norganisation.\"  Or we can borrow a leaf from Sun  Tzu's  Art  of\r\n\r\nWar,  which  emphasises defence preparedness and readiness,  and\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  strategic planning and strategies to overwhelm  or\r\n\r\noutwit  the  opposing side, with the help of balance  of  power,\r\n\r\ndeterrence and deployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th February this year, Total Defence Day was observed.\r\n\r\nThis  reminded us of 15th February 1942.  On that infamous  day,\r\n\r\nthe  British surrendered to the Japanese at the Ford Factory  in\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah.  We trusted the British to defend Singapore.   But\r\n\r\nthe  British instead surrendered.  The lesson of history is that\r\n\r\nwe  must  defend  ourselves.  Hence,  we  must  ensure  adequate\r\n\r\ndefence budget every year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is whether the Minister considers the defence\r\n\r\nallocations  for defence adequate, whether the  budget  will  be\r\n\r\nused  prudently  and cost-effectively, and whether  the  SAF  is\r\n\r\noperationally ready to defend Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, Sir, I wish to ask the Minister to give us\r\n\r\nhis  reading  of  the  strategic situation in  the  region,  and\r\n\r\noutline the possible scenarios that will face us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the measures that Mindef is taking to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  is  operationally capable and ready to deal  with  any\r\n\r\ncontingencies that might arise?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, in this year of recession, our\r\n\r\ndefence  budget for FY99, standing at $7.27 billion, is  roughly\r\n\r\nthe  same as that for FY98.  As the GDP is projected to  shrink,\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  percentage of GDP, the expenditure  has  in  fact\r\n\r\nincreased to 5.1%, instead of 4.6% in FY98.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth FY98 and FY99 expenditures are higher than those in FY97 of\r\n\r\n$6.12 billion, ie, 4.17% of GDP.  Yet, FY97 was a year of budget\r\n\r\nsurplus while FY98 and FY99 are both deficit years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is quite natural that some among us might ask: what\r\n\r\nis  the need to maintain or increase our defence expenditure  in\r\n\r\nthis time of tight budget?  It is also quite natural to ask what\r\n\r\nis  so  urgent about our defence such that we must maintain  our\r\n\r\ndefence  expenditure.  Why should MINDEF be exempted from  belt-tightening as required by other Ministries?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the expenditure policy of the Ministry. If\r\n\r\nwe  look  at  the  expenditure pattern of a  defence  capability\r\n\r\ncomprising  a  weapon  system  and trained  personnel,  we  will\r\n\r\nrealise that it would consist of an initial purchase expenditure\r\n\r\nplus  a  series of annual expenditures over its life  time.   In\r\n\r\nother  words, it does have a long tail of expenditure.  So  even\r\n\r\nif  we  stop  acquiring  new weapon systems  today,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nequivalent  to an immediate reduction of our defence expenditure\r\n\r\nbecause  much  of the annual expenditure has already  been  pre-established.   We  could  only  reduce  expenditure  if  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared to let these functioning capabilities go to waste.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, often times, a steady stream of expenditure for\r\n\r\ndefence capabilities is indeed cheaper in the long run versus  a\r\n\r\nfeast  or  famine  approach.  In the  latter  case,  the  weapon\r\n\r\nsystems will fall into disrepair, personnel would be reallocated\r\n\r\nor  lost  their  readiness due to lack of  training.   In  those\r\n\r\ncases, the cost of refurbishing to bring those capabilities back\r\n\r\non line might even be higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some might question why not defer the purchase of new\r\n\r\nweapon  systems  like  the Apache Attack helicopters  until  the\r\n\r\nfinance of the nation improves.  I think it will depend  on  the\r\n\r\nlead  time  of  putting  such  a defence  capability  in  place.\r\n\r\nTypically, a sophisticated system like Apache needs a long  lead\r\n\r\ntime  to  place the order, for the machines to be delivered  and\r\n\r\nthe pilots and maintenance crew to be trained.  The elapsed time\r\n\r\nis  typically three to four years.  Therefore, we should look at\r\n\r\nthe need of those weapon systems rather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  to  be  too  constrained by our decision based  on  budget\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, has asked who are our enemies in\r\n\r\nhis  speech yesterday.  He further said that instead of building\r\n\r\nup our strong and credible defence capability, why not we depend\r\n\r\non  international  peace-keeping forces.  He  even  pointed  out\r\n\r\nKuwait  as  a  good  example  of international  intervention  in\r\n\r\naggression.  I think perhaps he has forgotten that by  the  time\r\n\r\nKuwait  was  liberated by the international forces,  it  was  in\r\n\r\ntotal  ruin.   In asking to identify our enemies, the  NCMP  has\r\n\r\nviolated a taboo of international relationship.  Singapore wants\r\n\r\nto maintain friendly relationship with every nation.  Hopefully,\r\n\r\nwe  will  never have an enemy.  I think the NCMP knew this  very\r\n\r\nwell because he has been told previously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, last year I suggested that he look up the origin\r\n\r\nof  the Chinese proverb chian un tse wei to understand the  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  strong  defence  in peace time.   Perhaps,  he  has  not\r\n\r\nbothered  to  look it up.  Therefore, he asks the same  question\r\n\r\nagain  and again.  Perhaps, he has also other motives in  asking\r\n\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in supporting our defence policy, the\r\n\r\nNominated  Member, Mr Simon Tay, suggested that we should  carry\r\n\r\nout  dialogues to explain our defence expenditure so as  not  to\r\n\r\nproject an aggressive image.  This is so, especially at  a  time\r\n\r\nwhen  the countries in the region could not even maintain  their\r\n\r\nprevious expenditures because of their economic difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should remember that it takes time and\r\n\r\nmoney to maintain a constant level of competence, expertise  and\r\n\r\nreadiness in our armed forces.  It would be unwise to reduce our\r\n\r\nexpenditure just because we are concerned about being  perceived\r\n\r\nas  being  aggressive.  May I borrow another saying  from  Chuge\r\n\r\nLiang, the famous military strategist from the Three Kingdoms in\r\n\r\nancient  China,  chiong ku tze ping pai how  tung.   This  could\r\n\r\nroughly  be  translated as since the old time, those who  master\r\n\r\nthe   skills  on  the  use  of  arms  are  not  necessarily  the\r\n\r\naggressors.  Perhaps, those who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare  concerned  that  we are adopting a very aggressive  defence\r\n\r\nposture should also read the ancient literature as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the budget allocated to the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli is not here.

Some even face social and political turmoil and crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of these countries turn inward to overcome their\r\n\r\nown  political, social and economic problems, relations  between\r\n\r\nneighbours  could become even more sensitive and, to  a  certain\r\n\r\nextent, some even more strained than before.  Have all these had\r\n\r\nany effect on the strategic situation in Southeast Asia and East\r\n\r\nAsia   as  the  region  becomes more unstable  than  before  the\r\n\r\nrecession  began?  I could only assume so and therefore  support\r\n\r\nour  defence  expenditure in order to enhance  our  own  defence\r\n\r\ncapability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give his assessment of the\r\n\r\nstrategic and security situation in our region?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore is a small island amidst\r\n\r\nthe  seas of Southeast Asia.  Small as it is, Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\nstrategic hub or pivot, straddling the sea lanes from the Indian\r\n\r\nOcean  and the Straits of Malacca on the one side, and the South\r\n\r\nChina  Sea  in the east, and the Indonesian archipelago  to  our\r\n\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a port and a trading nation. We import and export\r\n\r\nby  sea.   The security of the sea lanes and access to  the  sea\r\n\r\nlanes  are  of vital concern to all of us.  The sea  lanes  must\r\n\r\ntherefore  be kept open at all times for food and  trade.   They\r\n\r\nmust  not  be  closed  off or controlled or  prevailed  over  by\r\n\r\nunfriendly forces.  The sea lanes should also be protected  from\r\n\r\npiracy  of all kinds. There has been a reported increase in  sea\r\n\r\nrobberies in the Straits of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the security of the sea lanes are the claims and\r\n\r\ncounter-claims by various powers over strategic islands  in  the\r\n\r\nseas,  for  example,  the Spratly Islands, Paracel  Islands  and\r\n\r\nMischief  Reef. There is much mischief, much to our dismay,  and\r\n\r\nwhich does not bode well for the security of the sea lanes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister for Mindef's\r\n\r\nassessment  of the security of the sea lanes and  what  are  our\r\n\r\nstrategies for ensuring that the sea lanes are kept open for our\r\n\r\nvital food supplies for trade, and also on the measures to  deal\r\n\r\nwith sea robberies in the waters near Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, in the course of recent\r\n\r\nyears, we have seen reports of rising incidence of piracy,  both\r\n\r\nin  the  territorial and international waters around  Singapore.\r\n\r\nRecently, a maritime report stated that piracy on the high  seas\r\n\r\nremains  high with seven ship crew members killed in 79  attacks\r\n\r\nin six months to June, with 36 violent cases reported.  This was\r\n\r\nfor 1997.  According to a report from the International Maritime\r\n\r\nBureau,  the number of casualties for 1997 had not changed  from\r\n\r\nthe  previous  year.  In fact, it is known that  Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nremains  the most vulnerable region for piracy attacks, with  31\r\n\r\nattacks  in  1997, out of which 13 were violent.   On  30th  May\r\n\r\n1997,  armed pirates injured an officer and shot dead a  captain\r\n\r\nof the Singapore registered \"M.V. Sinfa\" off Batam island.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic crisis beginning to bite into the region,\r\n\r\none would expect the incidence of piracy to continue to rise for\r\n\r\nthe  year.  Such activities of buccaneering of the high seas are\r\n\r\nunacceptable to us here in Singapore who traditionally  rely  on\r\n\r\nthe  safe  passage  of ships to ensure the  continuance  of  our\r\n\r\ntrading  activities.  Besides, the taint of having pirates  rule\r\n\r\nthe  high seas in the waters surrounding Singapore does not  add\r\n\r\nmuch confidence to our desire to make Singapore a leading marina\r\n\r\nin the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Police Coast Guard and the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\nNavy  carry the responsibility for the safety of our territorial\r\n\r\nand international waters.  We are a maritime nation and it is in\r\n\r\nour  interest to ensure that we are in a position to ensure  the\r\n\r\nsafety  of the ships' passage.  We should ensure that the  armed\r\n\r\nservices, whether it be the Police or the SAF, are in a position\r\n\r\nto carry out that duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether it is true that\r\n\r\nthere  has been an increase in the incidence of sea piracies  in\r\n\r\nthe  territorial and international waters around  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwhether more measures can be taken to ensure the safety  of  the\r\n\r\nships' passage through Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, the use of smart bombs and cruise\r\n\r\nmissiles  by  the US Armed Forces in the conflicts in  Iraq  has\r\n\r\ndemonstrated the superiority of these weapon systems.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  threat of air superiority and precision bombing has  forced\r\n\r\nmany  combatants to come to the negotiating tables.  The  latest\r\n\r\nexample is Kosova, the Albanian enclave which is trying to break\r\n\r\naway from Serbia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, these weapon systems are very expensive. I\r\n\r\nunderstand that each cruise missile costs $1 million.  But  they\r\n\r\nare  effective force multipliers and could minimise the exposure\r\n\r\nof  our troops to casualties.  Furthermore, they are also weapon\r\n\r\nsystems of tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister how MINDEF\r\n\r\nintends to take advantage of these technologies and whether  our\r\n\r\ndefence  doctrine takes into consideration such weapon  systems,\r\n\r\nboth on our side as well as on the other side.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, in view of the\r\n\r\nprevailing   economic  and  political  uncertainties   and   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of further deterioration in the security  situation\r\n\r\nin  this region, as already mentioned by several speakers before\r\n\r\nme,  could the Minister provide Singaporeans with some assurance\r\n\r\non  the capabilities and the operational readiness of the SAF in\r\n\r\naddressing  any possible scenario in the security  situation  in\r\n\r\nthe region?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, there is a saying that old\r\n\r\ngenerals always fought the last war.  They were not prepared for\r\n\r\nthe  next  war.   Drilled  in the old  methods  of  warfare  and\r\n\r\nschooled  in the old doctrines of war, they could not grasp  the\r\n\r\nimpact of the new dimension of technological warfare.  They were\r\n\r\nlike ostriches with their heads stuck in the sand of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War I, for example, thousands lost their lives in the\r\n\r\nWestern  Front  as the generals could not fully  understand  the\r\n\r\ndeadly impact of the rapid-fire machine gun, nor thought of ways\r\n\r\nto overcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In World War II, the tanks made its greatest impact, as the\r\n\r\nGermans   demonstrated   in   the   Blitzking   campaigns   very\r\n\r\nsuccessfully.   The  Germans of all people realised  the  power,\r\n\r\nshock effect and mobility of the tanks and fully exploited their\r\n\r\npotential.   In  contrast, some armies were still training  with\r\n\r\nhorse calvaries on the eve of World War II.  At the start of the\r\n\r\nwar,  the  Polish  Army, for example, sent its  horse  calvaries\r\n\r\nagainst the German tanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, technology is indeed our friend. I am sure our\r\n\r\nhighly-skilled and technologically competent SAF  officers  will\r\n\r\nmaximise  to the fullest the use of technology in the selection,\r\n\r\npurchase and application of military hardware.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, being small and with limited manpower and resources, we\r\n\r\nhave  all the more to focus on and to harness technology to  our\r\n\r\nadvantage.   Such  technology can also be  used  as  a  tool  in\r\n\r\ntraining and simulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our purchasing power, and highly skilled-technical\r\n\r\nmanpower,  we  can have the competitive edge through  technology\r\n\r\nand  the use of IT.  It is not just muscle and brawn in warfare.\r\n\r\nIt is the age of electronic warfare, and the IT battlefield.  It\r\n\r\nis indeed a technological contest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lack in numbers, we can more than make up for in terms\r\n\r\nof  technology, IT, firepower and mobility, whether it  is  air,\r\n\r\nsea or land operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT is being actively promoted in our schools and Singapore is\r\n\r\nmoving rapidly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards a knowledge-based economy.

Also, it would allow our personnel  to\r\n\r\nbenchmark  against some of the best armies, as well as airforces\r\n\r\nand navies in other parts of the world.

This is  compounded  by\r\n\r\nthe  low rate of birth in our population, and the fact that  the\r\n\r\nSAF  has to depend on and recruit from Singaporean male citizens\r\n\r\nand second-generation PRs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, with so many competing demands for the national pool of\r\n\r\ntalents,  the SAF has to fight for its share of top  talents  in\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question for the Minister is whether the SAF is able to meet\r\n\r\nall its manpower requirements, and what measures are being taken\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the requirements are met, and whether  the  SAF\r\n\r\nscholarship schemes, the SAF Study Awards and the other  schemes\r\n\r\nare  successful in attracting and retaining a fair share of  top\r\n\r\ntalents in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the SAF has over the years evolved itself\r\n\r\ninto an institution that is committed not only to the defence of\r\n\r\nthe   territorial  integrity  of  Singapore  but  also   as   an\r\n\r\ninstitution  of  nation  building  which  fosters  a  sense   of\r\n\r\ncommitment and belonging to our own country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of the Malays in the SAF is not new, and it was\r\n\r\npreviously  debated  extensively in this  House.   At  a  Budget\r\n\r\ndebate 10 years ago, several Members spoke on the issue of Malay\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  the SAF and had asked  whether  or  not  more\r\n\r\nMalays  could  be drafted into such other services  as  the  Air\r\n\r\nForce  and  the  Navy.   At that time, there  was  much  concern\r\n\r\nexpressed  by some Malay Members on the question of  whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  the  Malays can enjoy a higher profile in the  SAF  over  a\r\n\r\nperiod of time.  Specifically, the hon. Member, Encik Othman bin\r\n\r\nHaron  Eusofe,  asked the Minister to sketch a scenario  in  the\r\n\r\nnext five to 10 years on how multi-racial the SAF would be.   In\r\n\r\nhis reply, the then Second Minister for Defence, BG Lee\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHsien  Loong,  said  that the SAF had made significant  progress\r\n\r\nsince  the 70s.  He said then that increasingly, more  and  more\r\n\r\nMalays in the SAF doing national service had doubled since 1977,\r\n\r\nand  were posted more widely in the SAF.  We were told then that\r\n\r\nan  increasing number of Malays were also serving  in  sensitive\r\n\r\nunits like the commando battalion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, as more and more Malays were doing `A' levels and\r\n\r\ngetting on to university, there was also an increasing number of\r\n\r\nMalays  who  were  qualified for Officer  Cadet  School  and  as\r\n\r\nscholars.   Indeed, as early as 10 years ago,  there  were  even\r\n\r\nMalay SAF scholars who were on local training awards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was 10 years ago, and indeed, 10 years on, I believe it has\r\n\r\nchanged  for  the  better.  Over the years, I believe  that  the\r\n\r\ncharacter and composition of the SAF has changed to reflect  the\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  composition of the population in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nhave moved on and the issue at present is not whether the Malays\r\n\r\nare  doing  National Service in the SAF but whether more  Malays\r\n\r\nare  senior  officers  in the SAF.  In a recent  report  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  it  was reported that there are many senior  ranking\r\n\r\nMalay  officers in the SAF, the most senior of whom  is  a  full\r\n\r\nColonel.  Indeed, there is also now a Malay pilot in the RSAF in\r\n\r\nthe  person of Captain Mohamed Zakir Hamid who earned his  pilot\r\n\r\nwings in 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the situation in the SAF with regard to Malay\r\n\r\nparticipation  has  changed over the  years,  one  constant  has\r\n\r\nremained,  and that is, the promotion into the higher  ranks  of\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  must  be  made  on  the basis  of  meritocracy.   This\r\n\r\nprinciple  was reiterated by our DPM Dr Tony Tan in  his  recent\r\n\r\naddress,  wherein  he said that \"for the SAF, meritocracy  means\r\n\r\nthat  so long as the person is committed to Singapore, dedicated\r\n\r\nto  the SAF, and capable of doing the job, his appointment would\r\n\r\nbe based on performance and merit, and not by race\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support our DPM's statement on meritocracy for the SAF. It is\r\n\r\nimportant  to bear in mind that the SAF is not only an important\r\n\r\ninstitution for nation building\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  it also has an operational role to defend Singapore against\r\n\r\narmed  attack  in case of war.  It is imperative therefore  that\r\n\r\nthe  SAF  must be run purely on the ability of the  soldiers  to\r\n\r\nbear  arms  and  to  use it effectively against  the  enemy.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve that an organisation which promotes its officers on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  race would very seriously compromise its  operational\r\n\r\nability.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear therefore that for the SAF today, where\r\n\r\npromotion  is based purely on merits, the sky is the  limit  for\r\n\r\ngood  Malay  SAF  officers.  I can say that 34 years  since  its\r\n\r\nindependence,  Singapore  has  become  a  much  more  integrated\r\n\r\nsociety.   In  the coming years, it is likely that we  will  see\r\n\r\nmore and more senior Malay officers in the SAF.  If there is any\r\n\r\ndoubt as to the prospect of Malay officers in the SAF, let it be\r\n\r\nput to rest in this House.  We are not racists and do not intend\r\n\r\nto be one.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in recent weeks, there have been\r\n\r\nsome  discussions about the position of Malays in the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces.  Certainly, this subject has caught the attention\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was recalled by Mr Sin Boon Ann, Malays are known to\r\n\r\nhave  made  progress in the SAF.  It is noted  that  the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister and Defence Minister, Dr Tony Tan, has said  that\r\n\r\nit makes no sense for the SAF not to appoint or promote officers\r\n\r\nsimply  because  they  are Malays.  Like in  other  professions,\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  is  the  basis  for appointment  and  promotion  of\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a principle which Malays, like others, have\r\n\r\naccepted  and lived with.  Bearing that in mind, Sir, could  the\r\n\r\nMinister  enlighten  the House on how much progress  have  Malay\r\n\r\nsoldiers  made in the SAF?  For example, how many Malay soldiers\r\n\r\nhave  risen  through the senior ranks and won  scholarships  and\r\n\r\nstudy awards given by the SAF?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the\r\n\r\nposition  of  Malays in the SAF is now a widely discussed  issue\r\n\r\namongst members of the Malay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity.  I think this is a good development because it  shows\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  discuss this matter quite openly and objectively.\r\n\r\nIn  the past many thought that this is a sensitive matter not to\r\n\r\nbe discussed.  But this is also an internal matter.  I think the\r\n\r\nMalay  community has demonstrated their strong views  about  the\r\n\r\nneed to maintain this as an internal matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate also highlighted a number of important points\r\n\r\nwhich I wish to raise here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Malays see their participation in the SAF as\r\n\r\ncrucial in reflecting their role in Singapore.  They want to  be\r\n\r\ncalled up for National Service and prefer in fact to be enlisted\r\n\r\nin the SAF than even in the Police or Civil Defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Malays see the SAF as a key institution and have a\r\n\r\nstrong  desire  to  see sufficient number  of  Malays  occupying\r\n\r\npositions in the highest level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some who believe that to recognise the vital\r\n\r\nrole  the  Malays play in the SAF, there may be a need  to  help\r\n\r\nthem   accelerate  the  process  by  giving  them  some  special\r\n\r\npositions to occupy top positions in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally have a similar wish to see suitably qualified\r\n\r\nMalays  holding high positions in the SAF, not because he  is  a\r\n\r\nMalay, but because he is good and who happens to be a Malay.   I\r\n\r\nwant to see a Malay General because he is a good General who has\r\n\r\nearned  his  stripes.  I would like to see a  Malay  President's\r\n\r\nScholar  prepared to serve full time in the SAF.  Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nmust  make  sure that, while this remains our desire, they  must\r\n\r\nearn  it  and  meritocracy must be the main determinant  of  the\r\n\r\nselection process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, there are others who are also unaware of the progress\r\n\r\nMalays  have  made  in  the SAF over the years.   Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nwhenever  this  issue  is being discussed and  featured  in  the\r\n\r\nmedia, the same prominent commanders and pilots are highlighted,\r\n\r\nperhaps giving the false\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpression  that  the  Malays have not made sufficient  progress\r\n\r\nover this period of time.  Perhaps, the Minister could elaborate\r\n\r\nthis  and  hopefully enlighten the House on some of the progress\r\n\r\nMalays have made and to allay some of their fears that there are\r\n\r\npeculiar  policies  applied to the Malays  with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\nenlistment,  recruitment and deployment of Malays  in  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nSome still feel that there are many Malays who are exempted from\r\n\r\nNational  Service  and  the  various  high  training  programmes\r\n\r\navailable to them in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, in connection with the other policies,\r\n\r\nespecially defence expenditure policies, I wish to highlight the\r\n\r\nfact  that  we  cannot go on expanding our defence policies  and\r\n\r\nputting  more  effort into it if racial issues  are  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndivide us.  I think it should not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that there was an earlier suggestion in the\r\n\r\nHouse  that perhaps UN intervention could be one alternative  to\r\n\r\npreserve peace and security with us.  I pray safe that they will\r\n\r\nnot  come  because when that happens, this is  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir,  Members have brought up many pertinent points relevant  to\r\n\r\nour  defence  effort.   I will comment on  four  areas:  defence\r\n\r\nrelations, defence spending, people in the SAF and technology in\r\n\r\ndefence.  My colleagues in the Defence Ministry will address the\r\n\r\nother  points  which  have  been  brought  up  by  Members  this\r\n\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the economic and political uncertainties which have beset\r\n\r\nour  region  will continue into 1999.  Although there  are  some\r\n\r\npositive  indicators on the economic front, we are  not  in  the\r\n\r\nclear  yet.   We  cannot  be sure how the  global  economy  will\r\n\r\nperform  this year.  The last two years have shown  clearly  how\r\n\r\nevents   can   take   sudden  unexpected  turns   with   serious\r\n\r\nconsequences for political and social stability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, questions of defence relations have been brought up in\r\n\r\ndifferent forms by Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Shriniwas Rai.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  climate of uncertainty which prevails in the region  today\r\n\r\nrequires  more  focused efforts by countries in  the  region  to\r\n\r\nensure  regional peace and security.  Singapore's policy  is  to\r\n\r\nbuild   a  security  architecture  comprising  strong  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelationships    interwoven    with    multilateral     security\r\n\r\narrangements.   We  believe that such an architecture  helps  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  understanding  and trust and to foster  an  environment\r\n\r\nwhich  allows difficult issues to be discussed and disagreements\r\n\r\nto be resolved peacefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) is an example of\r\n\r\na  multilateral arrangement which has served its  members  well.\r\n\r\nThe  FPDA  has  been in place for 27 years and its members  have\r\n\r\nfound  it  to  be  of  value.  Over the  past  few  years,  FPDA\r\n\r\nexercises  and  activities  have  been  progressively  enhancing\r\n\r\nprofessional value.  The FPDA can be as useful and  relevant  as\r\n\r\nits members want it to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the bilateral front, our defence relations with a host\r\n\r\nof countries both in South East Asia and outside the region have\r\n\r\nbeen  expanding  in the scope and depth of the interactions  and\r\n\r\ncooperative  activities.   These  include  SAF  access  to   the\r\n\r\ntraining  facilities of our friends which is  valuable  both  to\r\n\r\nmake  up for our own lack of training land and airspace as  well\r\n\r\nas  to  allow  the SAF to benchmark itself against  other  armed\r\n\r\nforces.   The SAF has valuable training facilities in  countries\r\n\r\nsuch  as Indonesia, Brunei, Thailand, Australia, France,  Sweden\r\n\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the US, we also believe that the US military\r\n\r\npresence  in  our  region  contributes  to  regional  peace  and\r\n\r\nsecurity.  For that reason, we have opened some of our  military\r\n\r\nfacilities   for   use   by  US  armed  forces.    Our   defence\r\n\r\nrelationships  are  valuable  relationships  from   which   both\r\n\r\nSingapore and our partners derive benefit.  In most cases, there\r\n\r\nis  keen  interest  on both sides to see how  we  can  build  on\r\n\r\ninteractions and cooperation for even greater mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on defence spending, a topic touched on by Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung  and  Dr  Wang Kai Yuen, we must have a  credible  defence\r\n\r\ncapability to ensure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore's continued security and success and in order that  we\r\n\r\ncan  also contribute to regional peace and security.  Our policy\r\n\r\non  defence spending is to cap it at 6% of the GDP regardless of\r\n\r\nwhether  the  economic situation is good  or  bad,  although  in\r\n\r\npractice  we  have  usually spent less.  We  take  a  long-term,\r\n\r\nsteady  approach because defence planning is a long-term process\r\n\r\nwhich  requires prudent and steady investment over  many  years,\r\n\r\nboth  in  people  and money.  In this way, we  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the SAF proceeds smoothly and efficiently.  In  a\r\n\r\nway,  we  ensure that our defence requirements are well met  and\r\n\r\nthat foreign investors have the confidence to invest their money\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this policy has served us well. Today, we have an armed\r\n\r\nforces,  the  SAF,  which has helped to  make  it  possible  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  remain an oasis of calm amidst  the  turmoil  and\r\n\r\nuncertainty in the region.  The SAF safeguards our security.  It\r\n\r\ngives  Singapore  more room to adopt policies and  take  actions\r\n\r\nwhich  best serve our interest.  Hence, no one is tempted,  just\r\n\r\nbecause Singapore is a small country, to have aggressive designs\r\n\r\non us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the topic of people in the SAF, particularly some aspects\r\n\r\nof  Malays in the SAF, and the recruitment of manpower  for  the\r\n\r\nSAF  were touched on by Dr Ong Chit Chung, Mr Sin Boon  Ann,  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi  Daipi  and Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin.  Sir,  the  highly\r\n\r\ncapable  SAF that we have today is the result of many  years  of\r\n\r\ninvestment,  not  only  in  equipment  and  hardware,  but  more\r\n\r\nimportantly in people.  As Dr Ong has said, we must continue  to\r\n\r\nattract and retain good people to join the SAF.  And it was with\r\n\r\nthis objective in mind that last year MINDEF launched a Manpower\r\n\r\nManagement  Initiative \"The New Partnership Programme\"  for  the\r\n\r\nuniformed  officers corps.  The objective of the New Partnership\r\n\r\nProgramme  is  to provide a first-class career to  our  officers\r\n\r\nthat  is  both  challenging and rewarding.  The New  Partnership\r\n\r\nProgramme includes changes to the career structure, remuneration\r\n\r\npackage,  career  management and performance management  of  our\r\n\r\nofficers.  MINDEF has implemented most of the measures  in  this\r\n\r\ninitiative last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, it is not enough only to make changes to the\r\n\r\ncareer  structure  and  remuneration benefits  of  its  officers\r\n\r\ncorps.  The SAF needs good people at every level to ensure  that\r\n\r\nit  can  continue to perform its role effectively.  The  Warrant\r\n\r\nOfficers  and Specialists corps is just as important,  as  WOSEs\r\n\r\nform the backbone of the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having reviewed and revamped the management of the officers\r\n\r\ncorps,  MINDEF  has  embarked on a total review  of  the  career\r\n\r\nstructure  and remuneration benefits of the WOSEs  corps.   This\r\n\r\nreview  will  take an equally in-depth look as for the  officers\r\n\r\ninto  the  career structures and the aspirations of  WOSEs,  and\r\n\r\nwill  make  recommendations on how the manpower systems,  career\r\n\r\nmanagement,  and  performance management of  the  WOSEs  can  be\r\n\r\nimproved.  The study is in progress and the recommendations will\r\n\r\nbe  implemented starting in April next year.  When the  measures\r\n\r\nare  in place, we will enhance the SAF's ability to attract  and\r\n\r\nretain quality men and women at all levels, and better equip the\r\n\r\nSAF to meet the challenges of the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SAF has always emphasised quality manpower. To that end,\r\n\r\nthe  SAF,  like all sectors of Singapore society, works  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of meritocracy.  This means that so long as  a  person\r\n\r\nis  committed to Singapore, dedicated to the SAF, and capable of\r\n\r\ndoing the job, his appointment and advancement will be based  on\r\n\r\nperformance  and merit.  Regardless of whether  he  is  Chinese,\r\n\r\nIndian  or  Malay,  regardless of  what  his  religion  may  be.\r\n\r\nMeritocracy  is  an  important ingredient in  the  cohesive  and\r\n\r\noperationally  ready SAF that we have today.   I  have  said  on\r\n\r\nanother  occasion, and I will say it again this afternoon,  that\r\n\r\nit  makes  no  sense  for the SAF to deny an  appointment  or  a\r\n\r\npromotion to an officer simply because of the officer's race  or\r\n\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some Members have asked about the opportunities available\r\n\r\nfor  Malays to progress in the SAF.  There are today many  Malay\r\n\r\ncommanders - officers, warrant\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficers  and  specialists - in the  SAF.   They  serve  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious arms just like their non-Malay counterparts.  As  Malays\r\n\r\nprogress  up the educational ladder, they will also qualify  for\r\n\r\nmore and higher appointments in the SAF.  A higher proportion of\r\n\r\neach  cohort  of  Malay enlistees now possesses the  educational\r\n\r\nqualifications  for selection for training to be  commanders  in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.   There has been a corresponding upward trend  in  the\r\n\r\nproportion of Malay enlistees selected for Officer Cadet School,\r\n\r\nand  in  the  number of Malays serving their full-time  national\r\n\r\nservice as officers and section leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of Malay commanders in the SAF today reflects the\r\n\r\neducational attainments of the community and compares favourably\r\n\r\nwith  the proportion of Malay managers and professionals in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   About half the Malay regular officers are  graduates.\r\n\r\nThe SAF encourages promising young Malay officers who intend  to\r\n\r\nmake  a career in the SAF to further themselves.  They are given\r\n\r\nscholarships to go to university, like other deserving  officers\r\n\r\nin  the SAF.  Malay officers have been consistently getting such\r\n\r\nawards since the early 1980s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on technology in defence, a point brought up by Dr Ong\r\n\r\nChit  Chung, besides good and committed people, it is also vital\r\n\r\nthat  the  SAF  makes use of technology to  give  us  the  edge.\r\n\r\nTechnology  is  a  strategic tool for  the  SAF.   Manpower  and\r\n\r\nresource   limitations  dictate  that  the  SAF   must   harness\r\n\r\ntechnology  as  a  force multiplier to enhance  its  operational\r\n\r\ncapabilities.   In  the  modern  battlefield,  technology  is  a\r\n\r\ncritical  factor.  The odds favour the side that makes best  use\r\n\r\nof   technology.   Therefore,  we  have  to  be  proactive   and\r\n\r\ninnovative in exploiting technology for our defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the Defence Technology Group (DTG), which is the\r\n\r\nengineering  and scientific arm of MINDEF, has  built  a  strong\r\n\r\ntechnological  base.  We have invested in facilities,  equipment\r\n\r\nand,  most  importantly,  in some of the  best  engineering  and\r\n\r\nscientific  brains in Singapore to handle advanced  technologies\r\n\r\nneeded  by the SAF.  Today, the DTG is a smart defence equipment\r\n\r\nbuyer\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  well  as  a  technology application leader with  world-class\r\n\r\ncapabilities  in systems engineering and integration.   DTG  not\r\n\r\nonly  buys  the best equipment off the shelf, but  develops  in-house  expertise  to  modify, customise and upgrade  systems  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the SAF's technological edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we approach the 21st century, the challenge for MINDEF\r\n\r\nwill  be  to maintain and sharpen this strategic edge.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard,  there are two key driving forces in technology that  we\r\n\r\ncannot ignore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, technology advances at a phenomenal rate. New technology\r\n\r\nand systems emerge, then become obsolete at an exponential pace.\r\n\r\nThe  modern battlefield is rapidly evolving.  We must  therefore\r\n\r\nensure  that we will not have to fight today or tomorrow's  wars\r\n\r\nwith yesterday's technology.  Hence, we must be able to keep  up\r\n\r\nwith the rapid technological changes and continue to stay ahead.\r\n\r\nHowever,   rapid  technological  advancement  will  mean   ever-increasing  demands on Singapore's limited pool  of  engineering\r\n\r\nand scientific talent.  Yet it will be impractical for MINDEF to\r\n\r\nsimply  continue to expand its engineering talent pool, as  this\r\n\r\nwould   distort  the  deployment  of  the  national  engineering\r\n\r\nresource.   Instead  of simply growing larger,  we  have  to  do\r\n\r\nthings  smarter.  DTG needs to be nimble enough  to  effectively\r\n\r\ntap  on external engineering expertise to transcend our manpower\r\n\r\nlimitations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, unlike in the past, today's defence applications no\r\n\r\nlonger  lead technology advancement.  Some of the most  advanced\r\n\r\ntechnologies are developed by commercial companies.  We must  be\r\n\r\nable  to  quickly  seize  opportunities for  collaboration  with\r\n\r\nexternal   organisations  to  stay  at  the  cutting   edge   of\r\n\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is imperative that we find new ways of repositioning and\r\n\r\nre-organising  ourselves to ensure that we are  well  placed  to\r\n\r\nmeet  these challenges.  At present, the DTG in MINDEF  provides\r\n\r\nthe whole range of technology functions, from policy formulation\r\n\r\nto  acquisition, maintenance and development.  This  arrangement\r\n\r\nhas  helped MINDEF to build up our defence capabilities quickly.\r\n\r\nBut it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  nimble  enough for us to meet  future  challenges.\r\n\r\nMINDEF  has therefore decided to restructure the DTG  to  better\r\n\r\nmeet  the  future  challenges.  The  core  policy  and  resource\r\n\r\nallocation   functions   will   be   retained   within    MINDEF\r\n\r\nHeadquarters,  while the executive and implementation  functions\r\n\r\nof DTG will be undertaken by a separate entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will set up a new statutory board, to be called the\r\n\r\nDefence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) by 1st April  2000.\r\n\r\nThe  DSTA  will  serve  as  the  Ministry's  executive  arm   in\r\n\r\nimplementing defence technology plans while the Ministry retains\r\n\r\nthe  policy  planning  and resource allocation  functions.   The\r\n\r\nDSTA's key roles will be to conduct defence R&D, acquire defence\r\n\r\nmaterial, and develop military infrastructure.  It will also act\r\n\r\non  behalf  of  MINDEF  to  promote and foster  the  development\r\n\r\ncapability among the defence science and technology community in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The statutory board will continue to provide  inputs\r\n\r\nand  advice to assist MINDEF in policy formulation.   In  short,\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental organising principle for technology in  defence\r\n\r\nis  that  MINDEF  will determine what should be done  while  the\r\n\r\nstatutory board is free to determine how best to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transforming the DTG into a statutory board is the most\r\n\r\noptimal  framework  as it offers operational  flexibility  while\r\n\r\nensuring  MINDEF's  overall control.  Under the  new  structure,\r\n\r\nMINDEF  will  be  able to maintain a balanced  focus  on  policy\r\n\r\nissues.    We  will  not  be  overly  influenced  by  technology\r\n\r\nimplementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, DSTA will have the autonomy to operate in a\r\n\r\nfast   changing  environment  for  the  development  of  defence\r\n\r\ntechnology.  It will have flexibility in personnel management so\r\n\r\nthat  it  can  gear itself to meet the competition  for  quality\r\n\r\nengineering  manpower.  DSTA will also have more flexibility  to\r\n\r\nstrike  up  strategic  alliances  with  strategic  partners  and\r\n\r\nleverage  on  the  expertise  and  resources  of  others.    The\r\n\r\nrestructuring  will allow DSTA more space to be more  innovative\r\n\r\nand responsive to emerging\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and  to  try out best practices.   DSTA  can  also\r\n\r\noperate   more   efficiently  using  market  and   world   class\r\n\r\norganisations  as performance benchmarks.  And because  DSTA  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the  autonomy  to form partnerships, MINDEF's  technology\r\n\r\nneeds  will  be  met  through the increased  use  of  commercial\r\n\r\ntechnologies  and collaborations with research institutions  and\r\n\r\ncompanies.   This  will  alleviate  the  strain  on  Singapore's\r\n\r\nengineering and R&D manpower resource, and help us transcend the\r\n\r\nlimits of growth imposed by our limited manpower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will remember that MINDEF had corporatised the\r\n\r\nDefence  Science Organisation (DSO) two years ago  in  order  to\r\n\r\ngive  it  more flexibility to manage its people, and to  subject\r\n\r\nits  R&D  efforts  to  the discipline of  the  market-place  for\r\n\r\ngreater efficiency and responsiveness.  That was only the  first\r\n\r\nstep  in  the strategic shift in how MINDEF positions itself  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the  challenge  of defence science  and  technology.   The\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the DTG will allow us to complete  the  process\r\n\r\nof building high performance organisations to better anticipate,\r\n\r\nrespond to and exploit the future trends and challenges  in  the\r\n\r\ntechnology sector, so that the SAF can continue to receive world-class technology support to help it maintain its strategic  edge\r\n\r\ninto  the  next millennium.  MINDEF will table a  Bill  to  seek\r\n\r\nParliament's approval to set up the DSTA in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conjunction with the setting up of DSTA, MINDEF is\r\n\r\nreviewing  whether  the  rest  of  MINDEF  Headquarters  can  be\r\n\r\nrestructured  so  that MINDEF can carry out its  core  functions\r\n\r\noptimally.   At  the  time  of  our independence  in  1965,  our\r\n\r\nimmediate   priority  was  to  quickly  build  up  our   defence\r\n\r\ncapability.  We did that very well by having a MINDEF  that  was\r\n\r\nself-contained and hence able to respond quickly and effectively\r\n\r\nto the nation's defence needs.  However, MINDEF and the SAF have\r\n\r\ngrown in maturity and size since those early days.  It is timely\r\n\r\nto   examine   whether  a  leaner  Ministry  headquarters   that\r\n\r\nconcentrates on anticipating and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexploiting  defence trends and challenges can  better  meet  our\r\n\r\ndefence  needs.  This concept is akin to the practice of 'right-sizing' in the world of business.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have decided to set up a task force to be led by\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  Mr  David Lim to  conduct  a  comprehensive\r\n\r\norganisational  review of MINDEF.  The task force  will  examine\r\n\r\nthe  organisational  structure  of  the  Ministry  headquarters,\r\n\r\nMINDEF's  relationships with the SAF, the DSTA and  the  defence\r\n\r\nindustry, and its decision-making support infrastructure.   When\r\n\r\nthe  task force has delivered its recommendations and these have\r\n\r\nbeen implemented, the result will be a Defence Ministry that  is\r\n\r\ncorrectly  geared  to  define  problems,  formulate  strategies,\r\n\r\nestablish   policies   and  allocate   resources   for   maximum\r\n\r\neffectiveness in developing Singapore's capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a credible defence force does not depend only on\r\n\r\nhardware  and capable people.  A credible defence force  depends\r\n\r\nultimately  on \"heartware\".  At the core of Singapore's  defence\r\n\r\ncapability  must  be the will of each and every  Singaporean  to\r\n\r\ndefend our nation.  The economic crisis has brought home  to  us\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  Total Defence.  We have seen  how  critical\r\n\r\nstrong social cohesion is when countries are faced with a severe\r\n\r\ncrisis.  As new challenges emerge, our cohesiveness and unity as\r\n\r\na  people will be further put to the test.  We must continue  to\r\n\r\nremain united and face these challenges together.  We must leave\r\n\r\nothers  with  no doubt that Singaporeans are a cohesive  people,\r\n\r\nunited  not  only  in  good times but also in  facing  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.  That we are a people who will not allow ourselves to  be\r\n\r\nexploited  by  those  who  may try to  play  on  our  fears  and\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why MINDEF makes it a point to remind our people,\r\n\r\nespecially young Singaporeans, of the need for a strong national\r\n\r\ndefence, as well as of the important contributions that each and\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean  can  and must make to  enhance  our  defence\r\n\r\ncapability.  In the SAF, we have had for many years a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational  Education  programme  which  reaches  out  to   NSmen,\r\n\r\nregulars and non-uniformed personnel.  MINDEF also works closely\r\n\r\nwith  the  Ministry of Education, and conducts its own  national\r\n\r\neducation   programmes  for  school  children,  so  that   young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have a greater awareness and better  understanding\r\n\r\nof  defence  and  security  issues. Sir,  Singaporeans  have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand why we cannot take our security for granted  and  why\r\n\r\neach  and  every  one of us has an important  role  to  play  in\r\n\r\nensuring the security of our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to end my remarks this afternoon by quoting\r\n\r\nfrom  a letter which was published in the New Paper last Friday,\r\n\r\n5th  March  1999.  The letter is from 3rd  Sergeant  (Reservist)\r\n\r\nChong Yu Meng on his experience during national service and what\r\n\r\nthe SAF means to him.  I quote from 3rd Sergeant Chong's letter:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I remembered being really terrified of going into the Army\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was 17  -   right up to the day I turned up at the  old\r\n\r\nCMPB near Holland Village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was scared because I was unfit (I couldn't even do one chin-up back then, and my running time for 2.4 km was 13 minutes and\r\n\r\n35 seconds), and I didn't know what to expect at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training was tough and sometimes I felt really miserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to moan about feeling cold, wet, tired, hungry, thirsty,\r\n\r\nsleepy and sometimes nervous  -   all at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time I \"turned operational\", the Army had turned me\r\n\r\nfrom a 69 kg weakling into someone who could do at least 18 chin-ups,  run 2.4 km at the speed of 9 minutes and 15 seconds (which\r\n\r\nwas pretty fast for me then).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in a Junior College before entering the Army. I\r\n\r\nlived  in  a nice cosy world where everyone I knew came  from  a\r\n\r\nnice  family  and is reasonably well off, and University  was  a\r\n\r\nnatural progression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the Army, I began to see that the world is a lot more\r\n\r\ndiverse than I could ever imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met people who came from broken homes and some who were thrown\r\n\r\nout by their own families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, people who have had a much, much harder life than I.\r\n\r\nBut  I remember these men as loyal, faithful and honourable  men\r\n\r\nwho will not abandon you if things got rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that if the need ever arises, and we have to\r\n\r\nfight, these men will not let us down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I go back for Reservist training, I try to keep\r\n\r\nthat in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sacrifice is greater because they have no other\r\n\r\nrecourse   -   they  can't simply emigrate and it  is  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult for them to go to university.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 3rd Sergeant Chong concludes his letter by stating\r\n\r\nthat the lesson which he learned from his experience in the army\r\n\r\nis  a  simple one, and I quote again from his letter.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhat he says about what he learnt from his army experience:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whatever you can't defend, doesn't belong to you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last sentence of 3rd Sergeant Chong's letter, to me,\r\n\r\nsums  up  more  eloquently than any words which  I  can  say  to\r\n\r\nexplain why defence is important to Singapore and why we need  a\r\n\r\nstrong SAF.  \"Whatever you can't defend, doesn't belong to you.\"\r\n\r\nIn  this time of uncertainty, Sir, a sustained and steady effort\r\n\r\nto  maintain and enhance our defence capability is our guarantee\r\n\r\nthat  all  that we have built up in Singapore over the  last  35\r\n\r\nyears  will  belong  to  us.  A strong  SAF,  supported  by  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  through  their commitment to  Total  Defence  will\r\n\r\nensure  that we will not only emerge from these difficult  times\r\n\r\nunscathed  but continue to enjoy peace, stability and prosperity\r\n\r\ninto the next century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much obliged, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

It is  a  modern\r\n\r\nand  well-integrated fighting force, operationally ready to deal\r\n\r\nwith  any contingency that involves our national interest.   The\r\n\r\nSAF's  operational  readiness  is  maintained  through  frequent\r\n\r\nmobilisation  exercises and realistic training.  The  string  of\r\n\r\nmissions  which  the SAF has successfully executed  when  called\r\n\r\nupon   to  do  so,  at  short  notice,  testifies  to  the  high\r\n\r\noperational  readiness state of the SAF.  As a  recent  example,\r\n\r\nthe SAF was called upon to help evacuate Singaporeans caught  in\r\n\r\nthe  midst of factional fighting in Cambodia.  Sir, not only  is\r\n\r\nour  equipment ready and our men trained, but our servicemen are\r\n\r\nready  to do their duty.  Surveys conducted regularly by  MINDEF\r\n\r\nindicate  that our full-time national servicemen and  NSmen  are\r\n\r\nhighly committed to defend Singapore.  98% feel that they have a\r\n\r\npart to play in defending Singapore while 90% say that they  are\r\n\r\nready and prepared to risk their lives to defend Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results from our mobilisation exercises have also been\r\n\r\nconsistently  very  high.  The  percentage  of  NSmen  who  have\r\n\r\ndeferred  their  in-camp training has also been  very  low.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to  this  data, anecdotal evidence and  feedback  from\r\n\r\nvisits to units by members of the MINDEF headquarters and senior\r\n\r\ncommanders,  show  that our NSmen take their training  seriously\r\n\r\nand  are  convinced that we should have a strong and ready  SAF.\r\n\r\nMINDEF  and the SAF have also put in place programmes  to  brief\r\n\r\nand  update  our people regularly on recent developments.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help our servicemen to understand the continuing  need  to\r\n\r\nplay their part in ensuring that we have a strong defence.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will continue to ensure that the SAF is operationally\r\n\r\nready  to  deal with any contingency.  Sir, I am sure that  when\r\n\r\nthe \"green man\" flashes, our soldiers will be there.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety management is taken very seriously in the SAF, and\r\n\r\nis  supervised  personally by the Chief  of  Defence  Force  who\r\n\r\nchairs  the  Committee for the Promotion of  Safety  Efforts  in\r\n\r\nMINDEF.   Down  the  line, every division  or  formation  has  a\r\n\r\nformation safety officer whose role is to ensure that the  units\r\n\r\nin their division or formation train safely.  I mentioned at the\r\n\r\nlast  Committee  of Supply  the measures taken  by  the  SAF  to\r\n\r\nenhance  safety.  Since then, new measures have been  introduced\r\n\r\nto  further  strengthen safety consciousness.   Apart  from  the\r\n\r\nmandated   safety   courses,  briefings  and  procedures,   unit\r\n\r\ncommanders  are  encouraged  to hold safety-related  activities,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  seminars  and  many  exhibitions  to  promote  safety\r\n\r\nconsciousness  in their units and among their  men.   They  have\r\n\r\nalso   been  given  the  authority  to  purchase  safety-related\r\n\r\nequipment or material not found in the SAF inventory should they\r\n\r\ndecide that this is needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since November 1997, we have also engaged the Southern\r\n\r\nCalifornia  Safety  Institute  (SCSI),  which  is  a  leader  in\r\n\r\naviation  safety since 1987.  The SCSI provides safety  training\r\n\r\nto  the  United States Air Force.  The SCSI has been engaged  to\r\n\r\nrun  four  Risk  Management Courses for our army officers.   Two\r\n\r\nmore  SCSI  courses have been planned for the coming work  year.\r\n\r\nThese  courses  will  supplement the many  in-house  courses  on\r\n\r\nsafety.   The  SAF also has links with other safety  institutes,\r\n\r\nincluding  the US Army Safety Centre to tap their  expertise  in\r\n\r\nrisk management.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before carrying out any training or administrative task,\r\n\r\ncommanders  are required to go through a structured  process  to\r\n\r\nassess   the  potential  risks.   This  enables  commanders   to\r\n\r\nsystematically  identify potential hazards  that  require  extra\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures or commanders may decide to modify or  to\r\n\r\ngo  ahead  with the activity, after considering all the  various\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety briefings are also carried out before every exercise.\r\n\r\nSafety information and lessons learnt from past training\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccidents  are now disseminated through the Army Safety  Website\r\n\r\nin  the  Army Intranet which was launched in January this  year.\r\n\r\nOne  of the major causes of injuries in the SAF is road accident\r\n\r\nand  several  measures have been taken to enhance  road  safety.\r\n\r\nThese are: before a driver is allowed to drive on his own during\r\n\r\nan  overseas  exercise, he is required to undergo a  minimum  of\r\n\r\nfour  hours  of  day driving and two hours of night  driving  to\r\n\r\norientate him to driving in that country and in those conditions\r\n\r\nunder supervision so that the driver would know the terrain, the\r\n\r\nroad  condition and the traffic condition so as to minimise  the\r\n\r\nrisk  of  accidents.  Driving simulators are being  acquired  to\r\n\r\nbetter  prepare our drivers to cope with the complete  range  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  traffic conditions and terrain which they are  likely\r\n\r\nto encounter locally and overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also concerned about road safety when our servicemen are\r\n\r\nnot  training  or  on official duty.  To reduce  the  number  of\r\n\r\nmotorcycle  accidents  involving  our  regular  servicemen,   we\r\n\r\nsubsidise  half the cost of a defensive riding course  conducted\r\n\r\nby  any  of  the  professional driving schools.  The  number  of\r\n\r\nfatalities  that occurred during training has fallen from  three\r\n\r\nin  1997  to one in 1998, while the number of injuries requiring\r\n\r\nhospitalisation fell from 72 in 1997 to 50 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any training injury or death is one injury or death too\r\n\r\nmany  for  the  SAF.   We  will  continue  to  inculcate  safety\r\n\r\nconsciousness and find ways to reduce training injuries  through\r\n\r\nimproving training safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked about the clearing of unexploded oddment\r\n\r\nor  blinds at our live firing ranges to ensure the safety of our\r\n\r\nservicemen.  A blind clearing contractor has been engaged by the\r\n\r\nSAF  to  clear blinds in the SAFTI live firing areas once  every\r\n\r\nthree  months.  And blinds found during the search are destroyed\r\n\r\non the spot by the contractor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):\r\n\r\nSir,  may  I  respond to the question from Mr Charles  Chong  on\r\n\r\ndeferment from in-camp training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our NSmen form the bulk of our defence force. They\r\n\r\nare  our  frontline troop and have to be kept at high  state  of\r\n\r\noperational  readiness  to  respond  to  any  contingency  at  a\r\n\r\nmoment's notice.  The training and military proficiency  of  our\r\n\r\nNSmen should not be compromised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NSmen need to train together to be an effective fighting\r\n\r\nforce.   The  absence of a single NSman can  affect  his  unit's\r\n\r\ncohesion,  morale  and operational readiness, especially  if  he\r\n\r\nholds  a  critical appointment.  Deferment should  therefore  be\r\n\r\ngranted only in exceptional circumstances beyond the control  of\r\n\r\nNSmen and their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NSmen and employers understand the need for NS call ups\r\n\r\nand  have been supportive of their employees' attendance of  in-camp  training.   The  NSmen deferment rate  has  not  increased\r\n\r\ndespite the current economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparison, in 1995, of the 87,000 NS call ups, 4,500\r\n\r\n(or  about  5%) were deferred on the grounds of work commitment.\r\n\r\nIn  1998,  of the 98,200 call ups, 5,100 were granted deferment.\r\n\r\nThe deferment rate remains stable at about 5% of total call ups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MINDEF is mindful of the need to minimise the\r\n\r\ndemands imposed on NSmen and the inconvenience to their work and\r\n\r\nother  commitments, especially during this period.  In  general,\r\n\r\nNSmen  are given at least six months of advance notice  so  that\r\n\r\nthey and their employers can make the necessary arrangements  to\r\n\r\ncover their jobs during their in-camp training period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we are constantly reviewing and streamlining\r\n\r\nour NS training system to ensure that the duration and frequency\r\n\r\nof  call  ups are kept to the minimum.  For example, MINDEF  has\r\n\r\nshortened  the  duration  of  the basic  combat  training  (BCT)\r\n\r\nprogramme  from three days to two days, and the  number  of  BCT\r\n\r\nsessions in the 13-year NS training cycle has also been  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom seven times during the cycle to five times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF has also restricted the number of times an NSman can\r\n\r\nbe  called up for NS duties during a year to a maximum of  three\r\n\r\ntimes  per  work  year.  Where possible, units are  required  to\r\n\r\nbundle  together all the units' activities to coincide  with  an\r\n\r\nICT to minimise the number of call ups for NSmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, commanders have also been given the\r\n\r\nflexibility  to grant time-off of up to two days  for  NSmen  to\r\n\r\nattend to urgent business matters which crop up during their in-camp  training.  If necessary, deferment will also be considered\r\n\r\nand  priority  would  be given to NSmen  who  have  a  good  ICT\r\n\r\nattendance record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr David T.E. Lim): Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am responding to Dr Ong Chit Chung and Mr Sin Boon Ann on the\r\n\r\nconcerns  of the security of sea lanes and piracy in the  waters\r\n\r\nnear Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong pointed out the importance of the security of our\r\n\r\nsea  lanes for food and trade.  That is one reason why  we  have\r\n\r\nput  strenuous efforts into developing the capabilities  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore Navy over these years.  The security  of\r\n\r\nthe  sea  lanes in our region is also of concern,  not  only  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, but of the many other countries in the region,  which\r\n\r\ndepend on the sea for their trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than half of the world's merchant shipping fleet use\r\n\r\nthe  sea lanes passing through Southeast Asia.  In this context,\r\n\r\nSingapore  shares the view of many other countries that  freedom\r\n\r\nof  navigation in the sea lanes in our region must  be  ensured.\r\n\r\nAs  Members  know, we are not a party in any of the  territorial\r\n\r\ndisputes  in  the  South China Sea and we have always  advocated\r\n\r\nthat they be settled by peaceful means and not by force.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer home, I am happy to note that the incidence of\r\n\r\npiracy and sea robberies in the Singapore Straits  has gone down\r\n\r\nsubstantially since 1992.  This is in  large part because of the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  a  long  standing arrangement  we  have  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Called the Indonesia-Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCoordinated Patrols (ISCP), this arrangement involves  our  navy\r\n\r\nand  our Police Coast Guards and the Indonesian Navy and police.\r\n\r\nThrough  this  arrangement, the two countries  have  established\r\n\r\neffective  channels  of  communication.  The  arrangements  also\r\n\r\nallow  us to exchange information on sea robbery activities  and\r\n\r\nto facilitate cross-border pursuits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ISCP has worked very well in that there were no\r\n\r\nincidents of sea robbery in its area of operations from the time\r\n\r\nthe arrangement was implemented in September 1992 until December\r\n\r\nlast  year.  There were some incidents in December and  January,\r\n\r\nbut  there  have  been no reported incidents  since  mid-January\r\n\r\nafter the ISCP stepped up surveillance and patrols.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure Members that the Republic of Singapore\r\n\r\nNavy and the Police Coast Guard are ready to step up the efforts\r\n\r\nto  deal with the problem of piracy, should there be any need to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also now respond to the question by Dr Wang Kai\r\n\r\nYuen  on  smart bombs.  Dr Wang asked if the SAF would  consider\r\n\r\nthe  use of these weapons.  The SAF is always on the lookout for\r\n\r\nbetter technology to improve its capabilities and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nAdvances in electronics, optics, ordnance have thrown up a  wide\r\n\r\narray  of  new  weapon systems.  Smart weapon is  one  of  these\r\n\r\nareas,  and the SAF is pursuing it.  Being a small country  with\r\n\r\nlimited   resources,  smart  weapons  can  enhance   the   SAF's\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  enable it to better  utilise  its  resources.\r\n\r\nBut,  as  Dr Wang has pointed out, these are costly investments.\r\n\r\nWe must also evaluate new weapon systems, not only as standalone\r\n\r\ncapabilities but as components of a larger fighting system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF will continue to invest in technology to ensure that\r\n\r\nwe maintain our technological edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, performing National Service is an\r\n\r\nevent which is seen by many as an opportunity to serve the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncountry and its people.  It should also be an occasion marked by\r\n\r\nfamilies with pride because society recognises the contributions\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  families in sending their sons to  the  uniformed\r\n\r\nservice  of  the country.  After more than 30 years of  National\r\n\r\nService, boys leaving home and going to camps are treated  as  a\r\n\r\nmatter of routine by many families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some families, however, the prospect of their loved ones\r\n\r\nenlisting  for  National Service can be met with  a  measure  of\r\n\r\nanxiety.  I am not referring to those families who are reluctant\r\n\r\nto send their sons for National Service because of the perceived\r\n\r\nhardship  which  their sons would suffer.   I  am  referring  to\r\n\r\nfamilies whose income depend, either wholly or substantially  on\r\n\r\nthe  income of those brought in by their sons who are due to  be\r\n\r\nenlisted  for  National Service.  There are  many  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  those in the lower income families,  who  choose  to\r\n\r\nleave school early to help support the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many of them, working prior to enlistment is a means of\r\n\r\nsupplementing the family income and would therefore be  a  means\r\n\r\nof  subsistence for the rest of the family members.  To  require\r\n\r\nthese   males  to  perform  National  Service,  while  a   noble\r\n\r\nsacrifice,  would  mean  severe financial  dislocation  for  the\r\n\r\nfamily concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the SAF recognises the possible dislocation that\r\n\r\nsuch  requirements  may impose, and has put in  place  financial\r\n\r\nschemes  to help alleviate financial hardships that arise  as  a\r\n\r\nconsequence  of  the  registrants performing  National  Service.\r\n\r\nSuch  schemes  range from supplementary allowances  to  outright\r\n\r\nloans  which are repayable within a short period of  time  after\r\n\r\nthe   NSman  finishes  his  National  Service.   The  additional\r\n\r\nallowance  is  not  much.  I understand it stands  at  $200  per\r\n\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current crisis, I envisage that there will be a greater\r\n\r\nnumber  of  NS  registrants  who  will  be  caught  in  such   a\r\n\r\npredicament.  If the family were to depend on the salary of  the\r\n\r\nNS  registrant for subsistence, the allowance given by  the  SAF\r\n\r\nwould not be enough to help the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfamilies financially.  Additionally, the loan repayment within a\r\n\r\nshort  period of time will also impose an additional  burden  on\r\n\r\nthe serviceman concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Defence whether more\r\n\r\nassistance  can be given to full-time National Servicemen  whose\r\n\r\nfamilies  face  financial hardship as a result  of  their  doing\r\n\r\nNational Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I too echo Mr Sin Boon Ann's concern\r\n\r\nabout  the possibility that some National Servicemen who  happen\r\n\r\nto  be  the  sole  breadwinners of the family may  be  suffering\r\n\r\nhardship at this time of economic downturn.  It is possible that\r\n\r\neven with the various financial schemes provided by MINDEF, some\r\n\r\nof  which  Mr  Sin has also touched upon, these  families  would\r\n\r\nstill  endure  hardship.  So, therefore, I too  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider enhancing the MINDEF hardship allowance  by\r\n\r\nproviding a bigger monthly cash pay-out in the first instance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, I always believe that MINDEF should pay a fair\r\n\r\nsalary  to  our full-time National Servicemen, and  this  amount\r\n\r\nshould  be  roughly equivalent to the market rate in the  labour\r\n\r\nmarket.  Last year, when I spoke on the same subject, I  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that other than having more cash in the pockets, paying our\r\n\r\nNSF a fair wage would also increase the CPF savings of these NSF\r\n\r\nafter their two-and-a-half to three years in the service of  the\r\n\r\nnation.  We all know that CPF savings today are not just for old\r\n\r\nage  but  for  a  whole host of commitments  such  as  Medisave,\r\n\r\nhousing,  and so on.  For instance, their Medisave contributions\r\n\r\ncould be used to pay for the medical care of their aged parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, paying NSF their market rate would truly reflect\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  using  these young men as a  precious  resource.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  by  pegging it to the right value, this would  minimise\r\n\r\nwastage  of  their  time  through poor planning,  waiting  time,\r\n\r\nmisallocation, and so forth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister would consider some of my suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi is not speaking. Mr Gerard Ee.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I am advocating the\r\n\r\nintroduction of compulsory National Service for women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to put at ease the minds of all parents\r\n\r\nwho equate National Service with serving in the Armed Forces.  I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt that many parents would object to  having  their\r\n\r\ndaughters  charging  uphill with guns, blowing  up  things  with\r\n\r\nexplosives  and,  worse of all, getting muscular.   Mothers  and\r\n\r\nfathers would freak out at the image of their daughters'  lovely\r\n\r\ncomplexion  being  burnt by the sun and  pimples  sprouting  all\r\n\r\nover.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, National Service is service to the nation. All of us\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore should spend some time serving our nation.\r\n\r\nIt  should  not be the prerogative of the guys.  Our ladies  can\r\n\r\nplay  an  equally important role and make as much a contribution\r\n\r\nto  the nation.  I have in mind a Nurses Corps.  All young women\r\n\r\nshould  be  called  up to serve the nation in the  Nurses  Corps\r\n\r\nwhere  they will learn nursing skills which can be put to  great\r\n\r\nuse  in an emergency.  For the period of their service, they can\r\n\r\nbe  trained in our hospitals and thus help ease the shortage  of\r\n\r\nnurses.   Those found suitable for the task can then be attached\r\n\r\nto  the various services as Medics.  The remainder will learn to\r\n\r\noperate  in field hospitals.  During peacetime, members  of  our\r\n\r\nNurses  Corps can be sent on goodwill missions to  help  out  in\r\n\r\nmedical  situations  in the villages in the region  and  further\r\n\r\naway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest the system is seen as being chauvinistic, the enlisted\r\n\r\nladies,  after a period of basic training, should be allowed  to\r\n\r\nopt  to  serve  in the SAF.  There are both combative  and  non-combative  roles  that can be considered.  With warfare  getting\r\n\r\nmore  high-tech,  it  is not always muscle  power  that  ensures\r\n\r\neffectiveness.   In certain situations, women's intuition  could\r\n\r\nwell be the extra edge to combat effectiveness.  I have no doubt\r\n\r\nthat  women  can excel in the Armed Forces and could  outperform\r\n\r\nsome of the men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of National Service for men, the men have\r\n\r\nhad  to  face a disadvantage in their career.  By the time  they\r\n\r\ncomplete their term of service, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngirls  of  their  cohort would have had at least  two  years  of\r\n\r\nemployment.  Compulsory two years of National Service for  girls\r\n\r\nwill set this matter back to an even keel.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the social side, National Service requiring people to train\r\n\r\nand live together in groups has the desirable effect of being  a\r\n\r\nsocial equaliser.  Women from all walks of life, every level  of\r\n\r\neducational  experience, social status, will live and  learn  to\r\n\r\ncooperate  with each other.  They will learn to appreciate  each\r\n\r\nother as fellow citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the home front, every family will have a member who can\r\n\r\nhandle basic medical emergencies.  Perhaps this will lessen  the\r\n\r\nqueues  at  the  A&E Department.  Certainly ill members  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily, young and old, would be better cared for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an NSman myself, I have benefited greatly from the\r\n\r\nexperience.   During the term of service, I learned  about  team\r\n\r\nwork,  perseverance,  leadership and many other  qualities  that\r\n\r\nhave  helped me.  Why should the women of Singapore not be given\r\n\r\nthe  same opportunity?  And why should Singapore not be provided\r\n\r\nwith  the  benefit of their service?  With the current  economic\r\n\r\nslowdown  and growing pressure on job vacancies, this  would  be\r\n\r\nthe  best  time  to  seriously  consider  the  introduction   of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  National  Service for  women.   It  will  delay  the\r\n\r\nrelease  into the job market of a significant number  of  school\r\n\r\nleavers and graduates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Minister directs this issue to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth,  I  hasten  to add that whilst the  establishment  of  a\r\n\r\nNurses Corps would require input from the Ministry of Health,  I\r\n\r\nam  not  thinking of merely generating a large number of nurses.\r\n\r\nApart  from nursing skills, members of the Nurses Corps must  be\r\n\r\ntrained  in  discipline and organisation  and  be  ready  to  be\r\n\r\nmobilised.  It is the training of the SAF that can achieve this.\r\n\r\nThey will have to live in dormitories and conduct field camps in\r\n\r\ndifferent  terrains.   They  must  learn  to  operate   in   all\r\n\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, just as National Service for men cannot be done on a\r\n\r\nvoluntary basis, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a Nurses Corps can only be  achieved  through\r\n\r\ncompulsory service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I would not be wrong in saying that the\r\n\r\npublic  perceives  the  SAF  as an institution  which  is  male-dominated.   This is true of the combat vocations  of  the  SAF.\r\n\r\nWhether it be the Army, Navy or the Air Force, we will not  find\r\n\r\nany women performing any function in a combat capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I note that there are many women serving the\r\n\r\nSAF  today  as  full-time  regulars.  Over  the  years,  we  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly  seeing women in the SAF moving away  from  service\r\n\r\nvocations,  like  performing clerical  functions  and  parachute\r\n\r\nrigging, to being weapon or machinery instructors or technicians\r\n\r\nworking side by side with their male counterparts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we note that a growing number of armies are\r\n\r\nbeginning to engage the services of women in active combat duty.\r\n\r\nIn  the US, for instance, the US Army has had women operating in\r\n\r\nthe  frontline for some time.  Similarly, in Britain,  they  too\r\n\r\nhave women performing combat duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a tiny island nation state with limited\r\n\r\nresources.  We are not only constrained by the physical size  of\r\n\r\nour  country, but also by the relatively small population  base.\r\n\r\nAs  a consequence, the sharing of our human resource between the\r\n\r\nprivate  and the public sectors plays an important part  in  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of talents in this country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armed forces today, Sir, is a complex fighting organisation.\r\n\r\nWe   have  over  the  years  acquired  complex  weapon  systems.\r\n\r\nHowever,  with  sophisticated weapon systems, we  would  require\r\n\r\nsophisticated  people  to  operate and maintain  these  weapons.\r\n\r\nTake the F16 Fighting Falcon, for instance.  The F16 fighter jet\r\n\r\nis  a  very advanced fighter jet.  The technical skills required\r\n\r\nto fly the plane are so demanding and exacting that I understand\r\n\r\nonly  a  small percentage of the cohort of those who  enter  the\r\n\r\nRSAF  flying school would ever end up flying the F16 jet.   Sir,\r\n\r\nif the selection of F16 pilots is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso  demanding, would it not be in our interest to start  looking\r\n\r\nat  the  fairer sex in order to widen the talent  pool  that  is\r\n\r\navailable for our selection?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our womenfolk have in our nation's short history made\r\n\r\nsignificant contributions to the readiness and effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.   Because they are restricted on the role  with  which\r\n\r\nthey  are  allowed  to  serve, they are  excluded  from  certain\r\n\r\npositions and are limited in promotion opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in Singapore, we have a limited talent pool. In some\r\n\r\ncritical and key combat positions, limiting recruitment  to  the\r\n\r\nmale  gender  would only serve to restrict our pool of  talents.\r\n\r\nThese  would include senior staff appointments, and even fighter\r\n\r\npilots for the RSAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our women can meet the same high standards set for the men,\r\n\r\nthere is really no reason why they should not be allowed to play\r\n\r\na  greater combat role.  This is a natural progression from what\r\n\r\nour women in the SAF are accustomed to doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question, simply put, is whether the SAF would consider\r\n\r\nallowing women to take up combat duties in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, the declared policy of the SAF is to\r\n\r\nkeep the SAF young and fighting fit.  Towards this end, there is\r\n\r\na  cap  on  the  length  of service, and  regular  officers  and\r\n\r\nservicemen  retire at a younger age.  Thereafter,  the  officers\r\n\r\nand servicemen would start their second careers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all officers and servicemen would start second careers as\r\n\r\nlife  spans have increased and the national retirement  age  has\r\n\r\nbeen  raised  progressively.

Sir, in its report\r\n\r\npresented  to  Parliament  on 30th  November  1998,  the  Public\r\n\r\nAccounts  Committee  highlighted that in  recent  years,  and  I\r\n\r\nquote,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Report of the Auditor-General disclosed many instances\r\n\r\nof  non-compliance with prescribed financial control  procedures\r\n\r\nand  other  lapses in the Ministry of Defence.   The  number  of\r\n\r\ninstances   taken  together  and  their  recurrence   convey   a\r\n\r\ndisturbing picture of the lack of control-consciousness  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  This is dangerous as it increases exposure  to  fraud\r\n\r\nand corruption.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of particular concern is the laxity in tender and\r\n\r\nprocurement   procedures  at  MINDEF.   For  example,   officers\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  procurement should know that placing fax  machines\r\n\r\ndesignated  for  receiving competitive bids in  the  open  areas\r\n\r\ncould  lead  to  leakage of price sensitive information.   There\r\n\r\nwere  also  instances of wrong payment for in-camp  training  to\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen  and lack of proper  accounting  for  fund-raising activities for charities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General, in his Report for the Financial Year\r\n\r\n1996/97, has also pointed out that the MINDEF tender boxes  were\r\n\r\nopened  before the closing date of the tender and the 13 tenders\r\n\r\nsubmitted  after  the closing date were considered  even  though\r\n\r\nthey  did  not  fall  within the special cases  allowed  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MINDEF receives the largest budget allocation every\r\n\r\nyear.  This we fully support and endorse.  At the same time,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMINDEF  must ensure that it is money well spent.  There must  be\r\n\r\nstrict budgetary control and full compliance with all Government\r\n\r\nprocurement procedures and tender procedures.  Anything short of\r\n\r\nthis  would  not  be acceptable.  I therefore wish  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  what  steps  have MINDEF taken  to  ensure  such  full\r\n\r\ncompliance  and  whether any progress  has  been  made  in  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, at last year's Budget\r\n\r\ndebate,  I  raised the issue of MINDEF's tender  procedures  and\r\n\r\nweakness  in  financial  control based on the  Auditor-General's\r\n\r\nReport for the Financial Year 1996/97, the details of which were\r\n\r\nmentioned by Dr Ong just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Auditor-General's Report for Financial Year 1997/98, the\r\n\r\nissue  of MINDEF's financial control remains glaring, especially\r\n\r\non  the  question  of  accuracy of accounts being  confirmed  as\r\n\r\ncorrect by the Permanent Secretary.  The Report pointed out that\r\n\r\nthe  two  deposit accounts which were confirmed by the Permanent\r\n\r\nSecretary  as  correct, and I quote, \"found to  agree  with  the\r\n\r\nrecords kept by my Ministry\" turned out to have a discrepancy of\r\n\r\nmore  than  $100,000.  Furthermore, Audit could not  verify  the\r\n\r\nthird  account as the individual account listings were not ready\r\n\r\nfor  the audit then.  MINDEF owes an explanation to this  House.\r\n\r\nHow did the above happen and whether the third account mentioned\r\n\r\nin the report has been audited, and if so, what is the result of\r\n\r\nthe audit?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is time MINDEF woke up to the call for prudent\r\n\r\nfinancial control and the need to follow financial procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Matthias Yao Chih:</b> Sir, let me respond to Mr Sin Boon\r\n\r\nAnn  and  Dr  Wang  Kai  Yuen  about  allowances  and  financial\r\n\r\nassistance for National Servicemen.  Sir, MINDEF has a financial\r\n\r\nassistance  scheme to help needy full-time National  Servicemen.\r\n\r\nUnder the scheme, the needy full-time National Servicemen may be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  grant  of  up  to $200 per  month.   If  this  sum  is\r\n\r\ninsufficient, he can apply for further assistance in the form of\r\n\r\nan interest-free loan through his unit's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanpower   officer.   The  loan  is  repayable  by  instalments,\r\n\r\nstarting three months after his operationally ready date (ORD).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1975, a total of 1,636 servicemen have benefited from\r\n\r\nthis.   In addition, MINDEF also offers one-off grant and  loans\r\n\r\nto  servicemen in need.  For example, unit commanders  have  the\r\n\r\nauthority to extend emergency grants and loans of up to $500  to\r\n\r\nservicemen  facing  financial hardship arising  from  unforeseen\r\n\r\ncircumstances.   Sir, the applications have  been  few.   MINDEF\r\n\r\nwill  continue  to review and revise the grants,  if  necessary.\r\n\r\nBut at this moment, there is no revision in sight.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang also appeals for more allowances to be given to NSFs.\r\n\r\nSir,  full-time  National Servicemen are not  salaried  workers.\r\n\r\nThey  perform  National Service and they  are  paid  a  National\r\n\r\nService  allowance.   Most NSmen stay in  camp  where  food  and\r\n\r\naccommodation are provided free of charge.  The allowance  given\r\n\r\nto them is meant to cover incidental daily expenses, such as for\r\n\r\ntransportation.  The NS allowance is reviewed regularly to  keep\r\n\r\npace  with the cost of basic daily expenses.  The allowance  was\r\n\r\nincreased  in 1994 and, again, in 1996.  Our ongoing  monitoring\r\n\r\nshows that the allowance is still adequate and there is no  need\r\n\r\nfor  a  revision  now.    MINDEF will  continue  to  review  the\r\n\r\nallowance from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for paying the market value for NSFs to ensure efficient\r\n\r\nutilisation,  may I assure the Member that this is MINDEF's  top\r\n\r\nconcern  -  which is that the NSFs are properly and  efficiently\r\n\r\nutilised.  And to this end, MINDEF and the SAF conduct stringent\r\n\r\nchecks  and tests to ensure that operational training is carried\r\n\r\nout efficiently and productively so that, at the end of the day,\r\n\r\nwe  turn  out  operational units which are ready to  defend  our\r\n\r\ncountry at the moment's notice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr David T. E. Lim: Sir, Mr Gerard Ee has made a very spirited\r\n\r\nspeech about providing Singapore women with the same opportunity\r\n\r\nto  serve National Service as the men, and he suggested that  we\r\n\r\ntrain them to be nurses and deploy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem both in war-time and for peace-time purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his comments are noted. However, the purpose of National\r\n\r\nService  is to ensure that we have an operational capability  to\r\n\r\ndefend  Singapore.   As far as the military duties  and  defence\r\n\r\nneeds  are  concerned, MINDEF has no immediate  need  to  enlist\r\n\r\nwomen  for  National Service.  Through measures such as  use  of\r\n\r\ntechnology   and  commercialisation  of  non-essential   support\r\n\r\nfunctions,   MINDEF  has  been  able  to  maintain   operational\r\n\r\nreadiness effectively although the number of males enlisted  for\r\n\r\nNational Service has declined because of falling birth rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's point about the benefits of National Service for\r\n\r\nwomen is well taken.  However, it is a decision that should  not\r\n\r\nbe taken lightly.  National Service is costly both to the nation\r\n\r\nand  to those who are called to serve.  Based on the operational\r\n\r\nneeds, there is no requirement for enlisting women in the SAF at\r\n\r\nthis  time.  Nevertheless, MINDEF will continue to evaluate  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the question raised by Mr Sin Boon Ann who\r\n\r\nhas also spoken out for women and suggested that they should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  perform  combat duties in the  SAF.   Sir,  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  taking an increasing number of women into the  SAF  and\r\n\r\nindeed  there are at present some 4,000 women serving in  MINDEF\r\n\r\nand  the  SAF.  Most of them are in service, combat  support  or\r\n\r\ninstructional jobs.  A small number have applied to be in combat\r\n\r\njobs.  Those who have been found suitable and have been able  to\r\n\r\nmeet the requirements have been deployed in combat roles.  While\r\n\r\nthe  male  servicemen will continue to form the  mainstay  of  a\r\n\r\nfighting capability, we will continue to recruit women  to  meet\r\n\r\nour manpower needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I turn now to the issue raised by Dr Ong Chit Chung\r\n\r\nregarding  second  careers  for SAF personnel.   As  this  House\r\n\r\nknows,  the  SAF  adopts a policy to keep the  SAF  young.   For\r\n\r\nofficers, a full career with the SAF spans about 23 to 25  years\r\n\r\nand most officers will leave the SAF in their mid or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearly  40s.   Most  of our Warrant Officers and Specialists  who\r\n\r\nstay  beyond the first contract will also leave around this age.\r\n\r\nThis is an optimal length to ensure that officers and servicemen\r\n\r\ncan  make  meaningful contributions to the SAF and, at the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  there is a healthy turnover of leadership at every level.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  most  officers and servicemen  will  have  a  second\r\n\r\ncareer  after they leave the SAF.  The responsibility to prepare\r\n\r\nand equip oneself with relevant skills for a second career must,\r\n\r\nhowever,  continue  to  remain with the  officer  or  serviceman\r\n\r\nhimself.   But  we  recognise that it can be very  daunting  for\r\n\r\nsomebody  to start a new career in his mid-40s, especially  when\r\n\r\nhe  may  have  housing  commitments and  the  education  of  his\r\n\r\nchildren to worry about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can never remove all the concerns associated with the\r\n\r\ntransition to a second career but we can make it less  daunting.\r\n\r\nWe  do  it  in  two ways.  First, we introduce the  Savings  and\r\n\r\nEmployee  Retirement  (SAVER) Plan scheme for  the  SAF  officer\r\n\r\ncorps  in place of the civil service pension scheme.  The  SAVER\r\n\r\nplan  is designed to give officers a lump sum of money when they\r\n\r\ntransit into second career and through this, we hope that we can\r\n\r\nreduce  their  concerns on financial security so that  they  can\r\n\r\nconcentrate on their professional duties while in the SAF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, MINDEF provides second career preparation for all our\r\n\r\nservicemen,   officers   and   non-officers.    The    Personnel\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and Services Office (PDSO) was set up, among  other\r\n\r\nthings,  to  better prepare our servicemen for transition  to  a\r\n\r\nsecond  career.  This preparation starts from the  beginning  of\r\n\r\nthe serviceman's career.  We develop the servicemen by providing\r\n\r\nthem  with  adequate training for their jobs  during  the  early\r\n\r\nstages  of  their  career  and, wherever  possible,  appropriate\r\n\r\naccreditation is obtained for their training so that the  skills\r\n\r\ncan   be  relevant  in  their  second  careers.   Depending   on\r\n\r\nindividual  merits,  servicemen can also obtain  assistance  for\r\n\r\nacademic upgrading.  Towards the end of the servicemen's career,\r\n\r\nspecific programmes are available\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  help  them build up necessary skills to facilitate a  smooth\r\n\r\ntransition.   Such preparation activities include  briefing  and\r\n\r\ncounselling,  psychological preparation to help  servicemen  and\r\n\r\ntheir  families prepare for the changes, career talks and career\r\n\r\nfacilitation to link our servicemen with potential employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we have assistance schemes to help servicemen adapt to\r\n\r\nthe  employment environment outside the SAF.  In particular,  we\r\n\r\noffer  the Pre-Release Employment Programme (PREP) and the  Pre-Release  Training Programme (PRTP).  PREP grants half pay  leave\r\n\r\nfor  six  months to allow servicemen to work in a civilian  firm\r\n\r\nprior  to their ORD.  PRTP allows the servicemen to go  on  half\r\n\r\npay leave, also for six months, to attend a full-time course.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The feedback from our officers and servicemen is that these\r\n\r\ncareer  facilitation programmes have been  useful.   The  SAVERS\r\n\r\nPlan  and  our  career facilitation programmes  are  part  of  a\r\n\r\npackage   of  benefits  which  SAF  provides  to  our  committed\r\n\r\nservicemen.  With these measures, servicemen can concentrate  on\r\n\r\nthe  primary mission of serving SAF with minimum distraction and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  worry about financial security and  their  second\r\n\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on now to the questions about budgetary\r\n\r\ncontrols  raised  by Dr Ong as well as Mr Low  Thia  Khiang.   I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  firstly assure the House that  MINDEF  takes  a\r\n\r\nserious  view  of  the  observations reported  by  the  Auditor-General's  Office  and  which were subsequently  raised  in  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Accounts Committee's Report.  MINDEF has taken steps  to\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthen the respective systems to minimise the  kind\r\n\r\nof problems highlighted by the Auditor-General.  I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise that when these breaches were observed by the Auditor-General,  there was no loss or misuse of public  funds,  and  no\r\n\r\nfraud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of non-compliance with procurement procedures,\r\n\r\nthis has been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nraised  and debated in this House in detail in the parliamentary\r\n\r\ndebate on the 1997/1998 Budget.  What I would like to add  today\r\n\r\nare  the  further measures that have been implemented to further\r\n\r\nenhance compliance with established procedures.  The Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance has revised the Instruction Manual to allow tender boxes\r\n\r\nto  be  opened  not more than once in five days.  On  our  part,\r\n\r\nMINDEF has further streamlined our tender process such that each\r\n\r\ntender box is opened not more than once in four weeks.  This  is\r\n\r\nmore stringent than the new provision in the Instruction Manual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised IM also allows for retention of late tenders. I\r\n\r\nwould  like to stress that MINDEF considers such late offers  as\r\n\r\ninvalid offers.  However, we will continue with the practice  of\r\n\r\nusing  these  offers  as  price  comparisons  to  evaluate   the\r\n\r\nreasonableness  of other offers.  To further enhance  compliance\r\n\r\nwith  procurement procedures, in the coming procurement seminar,\r\n\r\nwe will be emphasising accountability and transparency in public\r\n\r\nprocurement  by highlighting the lapses that have  occurred  and\r\n\r\nthe  steps  taken to tighten controls. In line with Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance's  requirement, agencies handling procurement will  also\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  provide  annual declarations  that  they  have\r\n\r\ncomplied with all procurement policies and procedures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of breakdown on budgetary control, I would\r\n\r\nlike to assure the House that there was no improper transfer  of\r\n\r\nfunds,  nor  was  there  any  loss of  public  funds.   MINDEF's\r\n\r\nprevious  practice was to update each of the  transfers  in  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  system after it was approved by the relevant approving\r\n\r\nauthority.  The various transfers were then consolidated  and  a\r\n\r\ntransfer warrant raised for them.  This practice, although  more\r\n\r\nefficient, was not in conformance with the prescribed procedure.\r\n\r\nMINDEF  has  stopped this practice.  A transfer warrant  is  now\r\n\r\nissued  before  a  transfer fund is updated  into  the  computer\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interest of time, I would also like to inform the\r\n\r\nHouse that the other cases of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwrong  payments and in-camp training pay have been  investigated\r\n\r\nand  over-payments have been recovered.  Monies raised by MINDEF\r\n\r\nfor  charity, National Day celebrations and other projects  have\r\n\r\nalso been accounted for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move to Mr Low's concern about the discrepancies in the\r\n\r\nconfirmation of balances between Auditor-General's  records  and\r\n\r\nMINDEF's  records.   The Auditor-General's audit  revealed  that\r\n\r\nMINDEF  records for two deposit accounts did not reconcile  with\r\n\r\nthe Accountant-General's balances, although MINDEF has submitted\r\n\r\na  confirmation  certificate stating  that  their  records  were\r\n\r\nbalanced.  The discrepancies between these accounts were due  to\r\n\r\nerrors  during the migration to a new financial system from  the\r\n\r\nold  one.  MINDEF is taking action to clean up the data  in  the\r\n\r\nnew  financial system.  I would emphasise that in this  process,\r\n\r\nthere has not been any loss of public funds.  The new system has\r\n\r\nstabilised  and  we  have  since been able  to  reconcile  these\r\n\r\nrecords monthly with the Accountant-General's Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the incorrect confirmation of balances in\r\n\r\nadvance  accounts,  this  came about as  follows:   65  receipts\r\n\r\ncollected  by  MINDEF were temporarily posted  to  miscellaneous\r\n\r\nreceipt revenue account in the Accountant-General's Department's\r\n\r\nsystem  as  the nature of these receipts could not be determined\r\n\r\nat  the  time  of  posting. When the details of the  collections\r\n\r\nbecame  known,  adjustments which should  have  been  raised  to\r\n\r\nadjust the accounts were made accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I want to the thank the DPM and the\r\n\r\nMinisters  for their comprehensive replies and we are  reassured\r\n\r\nthat  the defence of Singapore is in good hands.

There is a growing recognition that\r\n\r\nwe need to promote home-grown industries and, of late, there are\r\n\r\nexhortations to groom more entrepreneurs.  Whilst we improve the\r\n\r\neconomic   environment  and  make  entrepreneurship  a   welcome\r\n\r\ndevelopment   in   Singapore,  I  wonder  if   the   legal   and\r\n\r\nadministrative framework is moving fast enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Bankruptcy Act has been amended to raise\r\n\r\nthe  cap  of the amount owed to $250,000/- for a discharge  from\r\n\r\nbankruptcy.   But since the last amendments, are we implementing\r\n\r\nthe  law fast enough? Anecdotal evidence suggests that bankrupts\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties  getting  discharge  from  bankruptcies.    I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that  they must show good faith in making  repayment\r\n\r\nbefore they can be discharged.  The question to raise is: are we\r\n\r\ndischarging many more bankrupts than before and has the pool  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  been correspondingly enlarged?  Have  there  been\r\n\r\ncases  of  relapse after discharge?  Or was the law ineffective?\r\n\r\nOne  may  assume  that  the regional economic  crisis  may  have\r\n\r\nworsened  the  situation and the number of  bankrupts  may  have\r\n\r\nrisen  and,  further, precious business manpower  resources  are\r\n\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest buzzword is technopreneurship. With the setting\r\n\r\nup  of  a  national broadband network, we are ideally poised  to\r\n\r\npromote   electronic   commerce,  or  e-commerce.    Hence   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  pre-occupation with encouraging the  growth  of  a\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy and e-commerce is timely.   With  e-commerce,\r\n\r\none  can  work  from  home, or even from  a  car.   If  more  is\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  work  from  the home in  e-commerce,  the  legal\r\n\r\nframework must make this possible.  In this respect, I  wish  to\r\n\r\nknow if the Land\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTitles  Act,  the  Conveyancing and Law  of  Property  Act,  the\r\n\r\nPlanning Act or the Housing and Development Act will be  amended\r\n\r\nsoon  so  that they are in tandem with the Government's call  to\r\n\r\nquicken the pace of e-commerce activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the fast-changing world of e-commerce, an area of\r\n\r\nconcern  is the protection of intellectual property rights.   My\r\n\r\nquestion to the Minister is: is technology changing faster  than\r\n\r\nwhat the current law has anticipated and is able to control?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Land Titles Act, the requirement for\r\n\r\nleases  of  over  7  years must be in the  prescribed  form  and\r\n\r\nregistered should also be looked into.  I understand  that  this\r\n\r\ndoes  not  help  entrepreneurs in setting up  businesses  as  it\r\n\r\nprohibits  the longer-term leases.  Under the Land  Titles  Act,\r\n\r\nunless the commercial property is already subdivided, the  owner\r\n\r\nwho may be an entrepreneur cannot give the tenants longer leases\r\n\r\nof  more  than  7  years.  On the other side  of  the  coin,  an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur may not be able to sub-lease a factory space unless\r\n\r\nit  is  already  sub-divided for more than 7 years.   Sometimes,\r\n\r\ncapital investments need time to have a pay-back and 7 years  is\r\n\r\nan  unnecessary  impediment to entrepreneurship  which  I  think\r\n\r\nshould be done away with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area which requires attention and soon is the\r\n\r\nprohibition  of  registering  homes  for  business.   For  those\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  e-commerce and working from their HDB homes,  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  prohibited from using their home  addresses  as\r\n\r\ntheir  business  addresses where they  can  be  contacted.   The\r\n\r\nInternet  is  blind as to the people and the physical  structure\r\n\r\nbehind  the  business. As far as the Internet is concerned,  the\r\n\r\nperson  behind the business is not known and sometimes an office\r\n\r\nis not particularly important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls to our people to change our way of doing business\r\n\r\nshould  always  be accompanied by corresponding changes  in  the\r\n\r\nrelevant statutes and carried out fast enough so that they  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  rather  than impede initiatives or entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nIf  the laws are inadequate or cannot move fast enough with  the\r\n\r\ntimes,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthen  it is difficult to focus on the bigger picture of our long\r\n\r\nterm  economic strategy.  This is especially so when Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy is plugged into the global economy and a slower start up\r\n\r\nmay  mean  loss  of  time and money and also  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ngrowth.   It  will  also  blunt  the  competitive  edge  of  our\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  and, moreover, lower their morale and  make  them\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  Government is not supportive or  responsive  to\r\n\r\ntheir needs and efforts to bring wealth to the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, we are a nation that\r\n\r\nprides ourselves as one that is ruled by the rule of law and  we\r\n\r\nhave  been praised by the international organisations like  BERI\r\n\r\nand  PERC  that we have a highly efficient and very high-quality\r\n\r\njudicial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the fundamental pillars of our society is also that\r\n\r\nignorance  of  the law is no excuse.  It is therefore  important\r\n\r\nthat  we  put access to the laws as a very high priority.   With\r\n\r\nthe  onset of the Internet, the Internet is one of the best ways\r\n\r\nto  make  information  available to all and  sundry.   Currently\r\n\r\nLawNet has got a database of the laws and statutes of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe also have handy references published, for example, by the Law\r\n\r\nSociety  of  Singapore on the different laws and  the  summaries\r\n\r\nthereof.   All this is fine and good, but if we could also  have\r\n\r\nInternet  access  for members of the public to on-line  statutes\r\n\r\nand  case  laws, it will indeed help us promote this  idea  that\r\n\r\nignorance of the law is no excuse and you can find it freely  or\r\n\r\nat a low cost on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could, at the very least, put on the common statutes that\r\n\r\naffect  the  man-in-the-street, perhaps like  the  Small  Claims\r\n\r\nTribunal  Act, Hire Purchase Act, Road Traffic Act, Penal  Code,\r\n\r\nHDB  Regulations, LTA Regulations, etc.  It would also  be  good\r\n\r\nfor  us to have hyperlinks on this Internet site to other  areas\r\n\r\nand  other  websites where summaries can be  obtained  and  this\r\n\r\nwould  help the man-in-the-street to know his rights and  duties\r\n\r\nand the responsibilities he has under our law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to my next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> All sorts of personal information today that\r\n\r\nis  captured  involves  Government and private  databases.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment databases of course contain all the information  that\r\n\r\nhave been given to the Government agencies from cradle to grave.\r\n\r\nThe  banks  and  other  private sector organisations  will  have\r\n\r\ninformation   on   your  wealth  or  the  lack   thereof,   your\r\n\r\ninvestments,  the debts that you have, your credit card  number,\r\n\r\nyour  NETs  and  ATM transactions, and perhaps even  information\r\n\r\nthat  has  no  relation to your banking account,  such  as  your\r\n\r\nmother's  maiden name, and the occupations of your siblings.   A\r\n\r\nrecord of your ATM or ERP transactions, for example, could  lead\r\n\r\nto information on where you go shopping, and if the system is on-line,  it  could  even, theoretically, be  used  to  track  your\r\n\r\nmovements  wherever you go.  There have, of course, been  enough\r\n\r\nHollywood  movies to drive home this point, almost to the  point\r\n\r\nof paranoia and hysteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Government systems are very secure, they are\r\n\r\nsecured technically and also because incursions and leakages are\r\n\r\ngoverned by penalty prohibitions of the law such as the Official\r\n\r\nSecrets Act, the Computer Misuse Act and other Acts such as  the\r\n\r\nBanking  Act  and the Income Tax Act.  There is  a  very  strong\r\n\r\nprotection of personal data.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, there are laws which govern\r\n\r\nconfidentiality,  the banking secrecy laws and  contracts  which\r\n\r\nprevent  the  dissemination  of personal  information,  if  such\r\n\r\ncontracts  exist.   But very often, these contracts  are  biased\r\n\r\nagainst the small consumer who almost signs his whole life away,\r\n\r\njust  for  a service.  Here, I am not being paranoid, because  I\r\n\r\nthink these things, even if the protection is in place, the best\r\n\r\nlaid plans of men and mice go awry.  We have seen recently,  for\r\n\r\nexample, incursions on SingNet which led to the \"SickNet\"  case,\r\n\r\nso to speak, where passwords were given on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Singapore is building itself as an e-commerce hub, and one of the things that will happen is that\r\n\r\ndata would be transferred from country to country.  The European\r\n\r\nUnion  has,  in  fact,  come out with a  directive  -  Directive\r\n\r\n95/46/EC - which deals with cross-border transfers of data.  And\r\n\r\nin  Article  25, paragraph 1, it allows the European nations  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the transfer of personal data which would be  inclusive\r\n\r\nof  data  used  in  e-commerce.  It  prevents  the  transfer  to\r\n\r\ncountries  which do not ensure an adequate level of  protection.\r\n\r\nAnd  adequate  level of protection is seen in the light  of  the\r\n\r\nrules of law, both general and sectoral, that are in force,  and\r\n\r\nthe  professional rules and security measures which are complied\r\n\r\nwith in that country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge that we review our laws to ensure\r\n\r\nthat we can comply with these provisions so that we can continue\r\n\r\nto  trade with Europe and we can continue to trade with the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  world that would require us to perhaps have  laws  and,\r\n\r\namongst  other things, also to have industry codes  of  privacy,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  perhaps the Association of Banks in Singapore, perhaps\r\n\r\neven  CASE or the NIAC.   These codes of privacy that are  being\r\n\r\npromulgated  could  be  given the force  of  law  and  then  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  can  be enforced so that we can indeed  be  able  to\r\n\r\nanswer charges if ever we are prohibited from trading with  data\r\n\r\nwith the European nations and with other jurisdictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, we have all read\r\n\r\nreports in the media about the competition between Singapore and\r\n\r\nHong  Kong.  And Hong Kong officials, we have read,   have  been\r\n\r\ncriticised for not being sufficiently proactive in improving the\r\n\r\neconomic competitiveness of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hong Kong official who recently said that we have been\r\n\r\nable  to  easily  adjust to make ourselves more competitive  was\r\n\r\nright  about one thing: that one of the advantages we  enjoy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is the Government's control of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nParliament.   The Singapore Government rebutted  the  official's\r\n\r\nallegations  to put him right.  But, in my view,  that  official\r\n\r\nwas not misinformed or inaccurate about our legislature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to be defensive about it. The Government\r\n\r\nis  in  control here not by sleight of hand or deceit, it is  in\r\n\r\ncontrol  because  this is what the people want,  election  after\r\n\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our consistent message to Singaporeans has been that\r\n\r\ninvestors will take fright if they sense that the Government  is\r\n\r\nlosing  its  grip over the legislative process.  The  Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nofficial  has now confirmed what we have been saying all  along.\r\n\r\nHe  has  effectively conceded that our ability  to  control  the\r\n\r\npassage of legislation has given us a decisive edge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any government can make promises or offer incentives to\r\n\r\ninvestors.   But  not many can quickly craft and  construct  the\r\n\r\nlegislative  framework  within which  these  incentives  are  to\r\n\r\noperate,  without  being distracted or delayed  by  politics  or\r\n\r\nlobbying.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy one substantial advantage over other countries,\r\n\r\nie,  our  ability  to legislate quickly and with  minimum  fuss.\r\n\r\nGiven   the   mind-boggling  speed  with  which  new   financial\r\n\r\ninstruments are created, it is a distinct advantage for us to be\r\n\r\nable  to  tell the investors that we can immediately enact  laws\r\n\r\nand reshape our regulations to keep pace with the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore crucial that we take advantage of this rare\r\n\r\nability to make ourselves more competitive.  We must demonstrate\r\n\r\nthat we can quickly settle the laws that we need to draft, enact\r\n\r\nand  implement to complement the changes in the financial world.\r\n\r\nThe  faster  we  update our laws, the greater the confidence  we\r\n\r\ninspire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors need to know that there are people in the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Law and the Attorney-General's Chambers whose  sole\r\n\r\npre-occupation is to keep updated on and to monitor  changes  in\r\n\r\nthe  financial  arena,  so as to give them legislative  backing.\r\n\r\nOne example was highlighted in the press\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecently relating to the need to review our banking secrecy laws\r\n\r\nin   the  light  of  the  changes  to  the  practice  of   asset\r\n\r\nsecuritisation, which involves the sale by a bank of loans to  a\r\n\r\nspecial purpose vehicle.  That sale cannot take place unless the\r\n\r\nbuyer  knows  the details of the customers whose  loans  are  on\r\n\r\nsale,  and  the buyers cannot know the details of the  customers\r\n\r\nbecause of our banking secrecy laws.  That immediately calls for\r\n\r\na  need  to review the laws to see whether we can amend them  to\r\n\r\nmake   them  consistent  with  these  new  financial  practices,\r\n\r\nwithout,  on the other hand, compromising the integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nsecrecy of the accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we also need to quickly demonstrate that we\r\n\r\nhave  developed the self-confidence to decide on  what  our  own\r\n\r\nlaws  should  be.   That after 33 years of independence,  we  no\r\n\r\nlonger  need  to have an umbilical cord to English  legislation.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, we still look to the United Kingdom to fill gaps  in\r\n\r\nlocal  legislation.  For many years, there was  a  debate  about\r\n\r\nwhat  English laws apply in Singapore, and that debate has  been\r\n\r\npartly  resolved by the enactment of the Application of  English\r\n\r\nLaws  Act.  But I do not think that solves the problem,  because\r\n\r\nthese are English Acts which we are applying so many years after\r\n\r\nindependence  and there is really no reason why we cannot  apply\r\n\r\nour  own  minds to decide whether these Acts or parts  of  these\r\n\r\nActs  should  be  borrowed and modified for our  purposes.   One\r\n\r\nexample is the Criminal Procedure Code.  It has been with us for\r\n\r\nalmost  a  hundred years and that Code continues to  maintain  a\r\n\r\nlifeline  to English law to fill gaps in the Code.  We  have  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate  to  the  world that we have the self-confidence  to\r\n\r\ndecide,  once  and  for  all,  what the  criminal  procedure  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is, and that we really do not need the English  fall-back anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what steps are being taken\r\n\r\nto keep pace with the changes in the financial arena and whether\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  is  reviewing  our  legislation,  including  the\r\n\r\nCriminal Procedure Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing we need to do is to show the world that our\r\n\r\npublic officials are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommercially  savvy and can and do respond to the needs  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  Often times, the laws we enact in this House vest  a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of discretion in our public servants.  And depending\r\n\r\non  how  they  act,  they can make or break  the  perception  of\r\n\r\nnimbleness  and  flexibility.  Some of our officials  have  done\r\n\r\nwell, but not many people know that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give Members an example. These days, before an\r\n\r\nInitial  Public  Offering is done, it  often  happens  that  the\r\n\r\nissuing   company  prepares  what  is  called  a  \"red   herring\r\n\r\nprospectus\",  without full details of the size of the  issue  or\r\n\r\nthe  details  of  the pricing.  The purpose of the  red  herring\r\n\r\nprospectus is really to distribute it to institutional investors\r\n\r\nso  as  to  gauge  the  depth of the  demand.   Previously,  the\r\n\r\nresponse of the public service would have been that since you do\r\n\r\nnot  have all the details in the prospectus, you cannot have  it\r\n\r\nregistered.   And if you cannot have it registered,  you  cannot\r\n\r\nhave  it  distributed.   But  the  Registrar  of  Companies  has\r\n\r\nrecently  waived the requirement, because he or she  understands\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  this  document to  be  circulated.   That  is  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  advance.  But my point really is that if  discretion\r\n\r\nis  being  exercised  in this manner, which is  consistent  with\r\n\r\ncommercial good sense, why not publish it to the world at large?\r\n\r\nThe  financial  community should know that these  decisions  are\r\n\r\nbeing  made and if they know about it, they will come to realise\r\n\r\nthat  not  only  do  they have in Singapore a  Government  which\r\n\r\nadjusts  and is flexible, but a legislature and a public service\r\n\r\nwhich are equally responsive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more points, Sir. First, on the question of the supply\r\n\r\nof  lawyers.   In November 1993, the Minister for Law  moved  an\r\n\r\namendment   to  the  Legal  Profession  Act  to  implement   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations of the Committee for the Supply of Lawyers.  One\r\n\r\nof   the  major  recommendations  which  was  accepted  was  the\r\n\r\nredefinition of the term \"qualified persons\".  In essence,  what\r\n\r\nthat  means was to control the flow of graduates into the  legal\r\n\r\nprofession  from the United Kingdom.  A list of 15  universities\r\n\r\nwas settled on and put in a schedule to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelevant  rules.  The Minister then said that the list would  be\r\n\r\nreviewed from time to time.  And my question is: have steps been\r\n\r\ntaken   to  review  the  performance  and  standards  of   these\r\n\r\nuniversities and is it the intention to revise the list?\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.25 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the issue of corporatisation in respect of which I\r\n\r\ndeclare  my  interest.   In  October  last  year,  the  Minister\r\n\r\ninformed  the House that the Law Reform Committee  and  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety would be putting up a proposal to the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers   and   the  Ministry  of  Law  on  the   question   of\r\n\r\ncorporatisation of the legal profession.  Has the proposal  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  the Ministry and, if so, what is  the  Minister's\r\n\r\nposition?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Law (Prof S. Jayakumar): Sir, I wish to thank\r\n\r\nthe Members who have spoken and let me respond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first take Mr Davinder Singh's broader question\r\n\r\nabout the need to review our laws in the light of enhancing  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  Sir, I do not think there is  any  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  legal  infrastructure  - and  by  that  I  mean  our  legal\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  our  laws,  procedures  and  regulations  -  will\r\n\r\nincreasingly play an important role in our economic development.\r\n\r\nOur  policy  therefore should be to take  a  proactive  role  in\r\n\r\nensuring  that our laws, legal institutions and legal  framework\r\n\r\nare constantly updated to support national objectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Davinder Singh's specific question on our laws to\r\n\r\nsupport  reform in the financial sector, the Monetary  Authority\r\n\r\nof Singapore and the Attorney-General's Chambers are in fact now\r\n\r\nreviewing the necessity to amend legislation such as the Banking\r\n\r\nAct,  which was referred to by Mr Davinder Singh, the Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry  Act, the Futures Trading Act, the Insurance  Act,  the\r\n\r\nMAS  Act  and the Companies Act.  This may need to  be  done  in\r\n\r\nphases as we will have to consult the various agencies as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  industry  and  professions  involved.   The  AG's\r\n\r\nChambers has in fact expanded its Legislation Division  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the  increasing drafting work.  Together with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance,  the Attorney-General has also undertaken  a  major\r\n\r\nreview  of  the  Companies Act, which began last year  with  the\r\n\r\nshare buy-back scheme.  I believe this review will bring the Act\r\n\r\nup to date with international developments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point raised by Mr Chng Hee Kok and, to some extent, by\r\n\r\nMr    Davinder   Singh   is   that   in   order   to   encourage\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship  and  business  enterprise,  we  should   also\r\n\r\nincrease our efforts to promote and develop intellectual  assets\r\n\r\nand to make our people understand the importance of intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty  rights.  In fact, as far as legislation is  concerned,\r\n\r\nin  the past year, considerable progress has been made.  And  Mr\r\n\r\nChng  Hee Kok will remember that we have made amendments to  the\r\n\r\nPatents  Act, the Copyright Act, the new Trade Marks  Act  which\r\n\r\nwas  passed  last  year,  which  has  not  only  modernised  and\r\n\r\nsimplified  our  Trade  Marks  law in  line  with  international\r\n\r\ntrends,  but also enables us to comply with the TRIPS Agreement.\r\n\r\nMore  recently, of course, we have also passed the  Geographical\r\n\r\nIndications Act 1998, the Layout-Designs Integrated Circuits Act\r\n\r\n1999,  which  will  further improve our laws  on  protection  of\r\n\r\nintellectual  property  rights.   These  laws  will   create   a\r\n\r\nconducive  environment for innovation and  commercialisation  of\r\n\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should also say that a draft Designs Bill is also under\r\n\r\nconsideration.   And when passed, Singaporean enterprises  would\r\n\r\nno  longer need to rely on the United Kingdom to seek protection\r\n\r\nof  their  industrial  designs.  It will  also  encourage  local\r\n\r\ninnovations and new ideas in industrial designs.\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh, Dr Toh See Kiat and Mr Chng Kee Kok made a\r\n\r\ncommon  point  that  we must constantly update  and  review  our\r\n\r\nvarious   laws  to  enable  the  competitiveness  edge   to   be\r\n\r\nmaintained.  Let me say that we support this objective.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe are also looking into the following areas of law:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A new proposed regime for the creation and registration\r\n\r\nof personal property securities;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We are reviewing the law on the formalities required\r\n\r\nfor the execution of deeds by individuals and corporations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) We are reviewing the application of consumer protection\r\n\r\nlaws in cyber space; the point made by Dr Toh See Kiat;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We are also monitoring international developments in e-commerce and reviewing the Electronic Transactions Act in the\r\n\r\nlight of experience gained in implementing such legislation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) We will also review the Arbitration Act to update it\r\n\r\nand  make it consistent with the International Arbitration  Act;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The laws of evidence, including the hearsay evidence\r\n\r\nrule,  will  also  be  looked at with a view  to  reforming  and\r\n\r\nmodernising these rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh made a valid point about the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code.  The Criminal Procedure Code, together with  the\r\n\r\nPenal Code, are legislation which has been in our books for many\r\n\r\nyears.   They  have  quite a history behind them,  borrowing  on\r\n\r\nprovisions in India and elsewhere.  We have not left it  on  the\r\n\r\nshelf   without  further  review  and  there  are   inter-agency\r\n\r\ncommittees reviewing both the Penal Code as well as the Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure Code, and the point made by Mr Davinder Singh will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  into account.  I expect that the recommendations  on  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  may enable us to come out with legislation  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse of the middle of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh talked about corporatisation and whether\r\n\r\nthe  Report has come in.  Indeed, the Sub-Committee of  the  Law\r\n\r\nReform  Commission  has  submitted its  report.   Amongst  other\r\n\r\nthings,  it  recommends that law firms be allowed to corporatise\r\n\r\nin  order  to  encourage  growth and to enable  our  lawyers  to\r\n\r\ncompete more efficiently.  Their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproposal  will  allow  eventually for the  formation  of  multi-disciplinary  \"one-stop\" professional corporations  as  well  as\r\n\r\nencourage  acquisition by our local law corporations of  foreign\r\n\r\nlaw  expertise.  In order to protect the interests  of  clients,\r\n\r\nthe report also recommends that it should be made compulsory for\r\n\r\nlaw   corporations  to  take  out  a  minimum  of   $2   million\r\n\r\nprofessional  indemnity insurance.  Other safeguards  have  also\r\n\r\nbeen  proposed  to  ensure that high standards  of  professional\r\n\r\ncompetence and integrity are maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that I have asked the Attorney-General\r\n\r\nand  the  officials in the Ministry of Law to study  the  report\r\n\r\nwith a view to implementing its provisions and, where necessary,\r\n\r\nto enact the necessary legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Davinder Singh asked about the list of scheduled\r\n\r\nuniversities.   Members will recall, when I last spoke  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject,  I said that the list of universities is not fixed  for\r\n\r\nall  time.  We will have to review it from time to time  because\r\n\r\nstandards  and curriculum will change, and I gave an undertaking\r\n\r\nthat we will constantly review it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the process of looking at the list of 15\r\n\r\nuniversities  in the light of our experience in  the  past  five\r\n\r\nyears.   But,  in  addition, we will also  consider  whether  to\r\n\r\ninclude   additional   universities  and  whether   well-reputed\r\n\r\nuniversities  in  other  Commonwealth  universities  and   other\r\n\r\njurisdictions should also be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might also mention here that the Attorney-General has\r\n\r\ninformed  me that the Board of Legal Education will  review  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum  for  the  Practical  Law  Course  as  well  as   the\r\n\r\ninstitution of the pupilage and the need for a formal system  of\r\n\r\nContinuing Legal Education for those in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, Sir, in reply to Mr Davinder Singh and\r\n\r\nother  Members  who have spoken, we will constantly  update  our\r\n\r\nlaws  and  develop our legal expertise to ensure that our  legal\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  would  be better placed to  support  Singapore's\r\n\r\ndrive  towards  a  knowledge-based  economy  and  to  meet   new\r\n\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on bankruptcy legislation, let me say that Singapore\r\n\r\nlaws  and  policies,  in  fact,  have  received  high  marks  in\r\n\r\ninternational ratings.  But we constantly review our  bankruptcy\r\n\r\nlaws   and  practices.   When  moving  the  amendments  to   the\r\n\r\nBankruptcy legislation in 1994, I informed this House  that  our\r\n\r\nmain   objective   was   to  encourage  entrepreneurship   where\r\n\r\nbankrupts,  who  have become so through misfortune  rather  than\r\n\r\nmalpractice, will be subjected to a more practical and pragmatic\r\n\r\nregime  of  bankruptcy.  This approach, in our  view,  helps  to\r\n\r\nencourage  entrepreneurship.  But even this area of the  law  is\r\n\r\nunder  review,  and I am glad to say that the Official  Assignee\r\n\r\nhas  proposed, and I have approved, that the cap of $250,000  to\r\n\r\ndischarge bankrupts will be increased to $500,000 and will  take\r\n\r\neffect on 1st May 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, under the current drive to promote\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship, the Ministry of Law is also leading  a  study\r\n\r\nto  see what else can be done to improve not only our insolvency\r\n\r\nlaws,  but  other  rules  and regulations governing  businesses.\r\n\r\nThis includes the many points which Mr Chng Hee Kok referred to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point that Mr Chng Hee Kok referred to the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  7-year  leases,  in  fact,  in  1998  we  further\r\n\r\nliberalised it, from seven years to 14 years.  But his point was\r\n\r\nwhether  such  requirements  are an  unnecessary  impediment  to\r\n\r\nbusinessmen.   I take his point.  The Ministry of  Law  and  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of Land Titles, will have another look at  this  area\r\n\r\nand to see if indeed it is a hindrance to businessmen, and if so\r\n\r\nwhether we can review it to make it less onerous.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh See Kiat's point, firstly, was on putting our\r\n\r\nstatutes  and information on-line.  I believe he knows  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  the LawNet Legal Workbench Seminar where we announced that\r\n\r\nInternet statutes would now be on-line.  His point was  that  we\r\n\r\nshould also make this available, free of charge, or at low cost,\r\n\r\nto  members  of  the public.  He will be glad to know  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, LawNet was among\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome of the more popular statutes on the website for free access\r\n\r\nby  members of the public.  What these specifically will  be,  I\r\n\r\nwill   have  to  inform  him  separately.   But  he  gave   some\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as to what these statutes will be.   This  will  be\r\n\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it can be completely free of charge, I should\r\n\r\nsay  that the Government has actually invested substantial funds\r\n\r\nto develop LawNet.  The maintenance and recurrent expenditure of\r\n\r\nLawNet is undertaken by the Singapore Academy of Law on a  self-financing  basis.   Therefore, law firms  have  to  pay  monthly\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  for LawNet to gain timely access to  these  laws,\r\n\r\nincluding  statutes  and  subsidiary  legislation.   So  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to charge a subscription fee to maintain and  support\r\n\r\nthe system.  But having said that, let me add that the Attorney-General and the LawNet Management Committee will explore ways to\r\n\r\nsee  how free access to our statutes can be given to members  of\r\n\r\nthe public without jeopardising the viability of LawNet, whether\r\n\r\nwe could have specific databases at the National Library, in the\r\n\r\nuniversity  and elsewhere.  If implemented, it could  mean  that\r\n\r\nmembers of the public will be able to browse through any Act  at\r\n\r\nthe  nearest branch of the National Library.  Another option  we\r\n\r\nare  considering is whether the information kiosk  (Nets  kiosk)\r\n\r\nwhich  is  currently  stationed at  the  Supreme  Court  can  be\r\n\r\nupgraded  to  provide  free  access  to  statutes  database  for\r\n\r\nvisiting members of the public.  Being a lawyer, Dr Toh See Kiat\r\n\r\nwill  know that reading a statute on its own will not provide  a\r\n\r\nfull understanding of the law for non-lawyers.  So I should make\r\n\r\nthat  note  of caution here.  It may be necessary to read  books\r\n\r\nand  other  materials such as the Law Society's and  CASE's  own\r\n\r\nbrochures explaining the law to non-lawyers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. \"Guillotine\" time.

But may I say that the second amendment\r\n\r\nthat I sent in has been re-worded.  What I sent in was \"Speeding\r\n\r\nup  of time for hearing of cases\".  I suppose I should have said\r\n\r\n\"Speeding  the hearing of cases\".  Reduction of time would  seem\r\n\r\nto suggest something quite different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now come to the amendment. First of all, the\r\n\r\nAppellate  System.  I have, as Members are aware in this  House,\r\n\r\nmore  than once raised the question of the appeals that are  now\r\n\r\navailable  to our citizens from the decisions of a single  judge\r\n\r\nor  magistrate.  I do not have to inform this House that for the\r\n\r\naverage  citizen  to be totally satisfied that he  has  obtained\r\n\r\njustice  in  any court, it will be necessary that he  should  be\r\n\r\nallowed  an appeal from that decision to a higher court and,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to a further court.  At the moment, we  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nrestricting these appeals that are available to our citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, we restricted very drastically the appeals in\r\n\r\ncivil  cases,  those heard in the Subordinate Courts.   I  think\r\n\r\nseveral  Members, including myself, have expressed  our  concern\r\n\r\nand  our  unhappiness at this restriction.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to reconsider again the availability of  appeals  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  am  particularly concerned  about  the  criminal\r\n\r\nappeals.  A greater portion of the criminal cases, almost 90% of\r\n\r\nthe  criminal  cases,  are  now heard  and  dealt  with  in  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts.  The District Courts have the  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nto  pass  very heavy sentences.  I stand corrected,  I  think  a\r\n\r\nDistrict Court in some cases can pass a sentence up to 20  years\r\n\r\nof imprisonment.  That is a very stiff heavy sentence.  From\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat, an accused person, if he is not satisfied, not happy  with\r\n\r\nthe decision, has at the moment, for all practical purposes,  an\r\n\r\nappeal only to a single judge.  He has no further appeals  after\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the single Judge who hears the appeal may not be\r\n\r\nsomeone who has practised or sat in the criminal courts,  and  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  lawyers  have felt that there should  be  a  further\r\n\r\nappeal  given as of right in the more serious criminal cases  to\r\n\r\nthe  Court  of  Criminal Appeal.  It may be felt that  to  allow\r\n\r\nevery  accused person who is convicted a right of appeal to  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Criminal Appeal would overload the Court of  Criminal\r\n\r\nAppeal.   But if that is the concern, some restriction could  be\r\n\r\nplaced on it by limiting appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal\r\n\r\nto the more serious cases, where the sentence of imprisonment is\r\n\r\nquite  heavy,  and the man is incarcerated as a  result  of  his\r\n\r\nconviction for a very long period of time in the prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge the consideration of a separate panel in\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Criminal Appeal to hear criminal appeals.  In  the\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom, there is the Court of Criminal Appeal, and  then\r\n\r\nthere  is  the  Court of Appeal.  The Court of  Criminal  Appeal\r\n\r\nhears  purely appeals in criminal cases.  If it is felt that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  have  two separate panels permanently, can consideration\r\n\r\nnot  be  given to appointing ad hoc Judges to the panel  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt  hearing criminal appeals, so that they can deal with  the\r\n\r\nappeal, and be paid on an ad hoc basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justice is a very important factor for the cohesion of the\r\n\r\nsociety  and for the stability in the society.  The citizen  has\r\n\r\nto  be,  as  I said, given complete and full confidence  in  our\r\n\r\nsystem  of  justice  that  is administered  in  Singapore.   The\r\n\r\nMinisters  have trotted out the praise given by rating  agencies\r\n\r\noutside of the justice that is meted out in Singapore.  But what\r\n\r\nis   forgotten  is  that  these  agencies  are  concerned   with\r\n\r\ncommercial  cases and how disputes in the commercial sector  are\r\n\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I  have  got  a  different\r\n\r\nproposition, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am one of those who have been very supportive, and I still\r\n\r\nsupport, that we have done away with the Privy Council.  We have\r\n\r\ngot  our  own Court of Appeal.  It has come of age.  I have  one\r\n\r\ncomplaint.   We still have got only three permanent  Judges  for\r\n\r\nthe Court of Appeal.  I would urge that we should increase it to\r\n\r\nat  least five.  In important cases, the quorum should be  five.\r\n\r\nI  know  of  the present practice.  The Chief Justice could  ask\r\n\r\nother Judges to sit in the Court of Appeal, but that is not very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   Hong Kong has got more permanent  Supreme  Court\r\n\r\nJudges of Appeal, and the Court of Appeal in UK as well.   So  I\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Government to reconsider the position.  It is not\r\n\r\ngoing  to be a tremendous financial burden on the coffer  if  we\r\n\r\nhave two more Judges of Appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of community mediation, I applaud the Ministry,\r\n\r\nand I think the work is well received by the public.  We are  an\r\n\r\nAsian  society.  We are not a litigious society and  we  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve in getting involved in litigation.  Litigation should be\r\n\r\na last resort.  I have in mind two proposals for the Government.\r\n\r\nFirst,  take  away  all private summonses, ie,  those  summonses\r\n\r\nwhich  are  instituted by the citizens against  other  citizens.\r\n\r\nAlso,  small summonses involving family members should be  dealt\r\n\r\nby  the  mediation centre rather than by the court.  Because  in\r\n\r\nthe court, the parties engage lawyers, there is publicity, there\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis   situation  sometimes,  through  cross-examination,  where\r\n\r\npeople  come  to very bitter ends.  If it is through  mediation,\r\n\r\npeople  sit  in  closed  door.  I suggest  the  people  who  are\r\n\r\nappointed  mediators should be people with experience  in  life,\r\n\r\nretired civil servants, and lawyers in active practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the role of the community mediation centre should be\r\n\r\nenhanced.   It  has  been in operation for some  time,  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity is very grateful to this organisation.  Sir,  I  would\r\n\r\nurge the Government to give a second thought.  I have spoken  on\r\n\r\nit earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> The Family Court\r\n\r\nhas  counselled and mediated many divorce, custody,  maintenance\r\n\r\nand family violence cases.  I would like to add to the effort of\r\n\r\nthe  Subordinate Courts in enhancing its mission  to  administer\r\n\r\njustice by making a few suggestions on mediation principles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is to adopt a very cautious policy on pre-mediation\r\n\r\nscreening of all clients by trained officers in family  disputes\r\n\r\nbefore  a  decision  is taken to proceed  with  mediation.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  is  to  adopt  a  careful balance in  engaging  parallel\r\n\r\ncounselling  and  mediation procedures  in  managing  a  complex\r\n\r\nrelationship  by  giving  priority to client  protection,  child\r\n\r\nprotection  and  mediator safety.  A protocol of best  practices\r\n\r\nmust  be  drawn up and followed.  The third is to  be  ready  to\r\n\r\nterminate mediation in an apparent marital dispute over property\r\n\r\nand children, once domestic violence emerges as an issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I raise these concerns because mediation is effective and\r\n\r\njust  only  when  contending parties could  negotiate  on  equal\r\n\r\nterms.   If  any  one  contending  party  perceives  threat   or\r\n\r\nviolence,  and domestic violence is still a \"live\"  issue,  this\r\n\r\nobservation  must be taken into account in any arrangement  made\r\n\r\nby  the mediator.  Otherwise, we may subject the weaker party to\r\n\r\ncontinued violence at home, away from the eyes of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intake Counselling Unit set up by the Family Court is a\r\n\r\npositive  initiative.

Or\r\n\r\nis  there  a shortage of social workers?  Would the Courts  then\r\n\r\nconsider  foreign recruitment, if we cannot find  local  skills?\r\n\r\nSir,  we need appropriate skills, forecast and stronger resource\r\n\r\nallocation  in planning the social work curriculum  and  student\r\n\r\nintake  at our tertiary institutions to strengthen the  manpower\r\n\r\nneeds of various Ministries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nlet  me  first  take Mr Jeyaretnam's point.  As he  himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  he has made this point many times before.  Therefore,  it\r\n\r\nis  an old story.  In fact, as recently as the last time when we\r\n\r\ntook  the amendment on the Supreme Court of Judicature Act,  the\r\n\r\nMinister has already replied in full as to why there is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong with the appellate system and why there is no need to  add\r\n\r\ntiers to this system.  I think that is basically Mr Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\npoint - that there should be more tiers to our appellate system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to put the situation in context. As Dr Toh\r\n\r\nalluded  to,  and in fact Mr Jeyaretnam himself also  said,  our\r\n\r\njudicial  system has been praised.  We have received  very  good\r\n\r\nratings  from  international agencies not just in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness aspect but also in terms of the courts and the  police,\r\n\r\nboth from the Institute of Management and Development as well as\r\n\r\nfrom  PERC  (Political  and Economic  Risks  Consultancy).   And\r\n\r\nindeed  even Singaporeans in surveys and foreigners living  here\r\n\r\nhave expressed confidence in our judicial system.  Why?  Because\r\n\r\nthey  know  of all the innovations that have been  made  by  the\r\n\r\nCourts,  innovations that started when the current Chief Justice\r\n\r\ntook up his position as Chief Justice, which now spans seven  to\r\n\r\neight years.  I think all of us know that the Chief Justice  and\r\n\r\nthe Courts are very proactive.  In other words, what needs to be\r\n\r\ndone  to  improve the administration of justice as well  as  the\r\n\r\nquality of justice will be done.  That is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if Mr Jeyaretnam said that we should have more tiers of\r\n\r\nappeal  to  increase the quality of justice, the  point  is,  if\r\n\r\nindeed  that  will increase the quality of justice,  that  would\r\n\r\nhave  been done.  The question is, would it necessarily  improve\r\n\r\nthe quality of justice?  Further tiers do not necessarily result\r\n\r\nin  that.   What is important, as I have stressed many times  in\r\n\r\nthis House before, is the quality of the Judges - quality of the\r\n\r\nJudges both at the hearing stage as well as the appeal stage.  I\r\n\r\nam  sure  that lawyers in this House as well as lawyers  out  of\r\n\r\nthis  House will agree that the quality of our Judges and  their\r\n\r\njudgements have gone up consistently over the years.  And  this,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  has  resulted in the low number of appeals  that  are\r\n\r\nbeing lodged from the Subordinate Courts to the High Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is how seriously appeals are taken. The fact\r\n\r\nthat  the Chief Justice hears all magistrates' appeals indicates\r\n\r\nthat  they are very seriously taken.  Because he hears all these\r\n\r\nappeals,  he ensures that there is consistency in the sentencing\r\n\r\nas well as set benchmark sentences.  Hence, it is not necessary,\r\n\r\nas Mr Jeyaretnam has suggested, for there to be a further appeal\r\n\r\nfor  what  he  calls  the more serious cases or  cases  carrying\r\n\r\nhigher  penalties, magistrates' appeals going  up  to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  and  then to the Court of Appeal.  Because  we  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  finality  and certainty of  proceedings  are  also\r\n\r\nimportant features of a sound legal infrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that he makes is the institution of a separate\r\n\r\npanel of Judges to hear criminal appeals, or the appointment  of\r\n\r\nad  hoc Judges, to hear these appeals.  This in a way is related\r\n\r\nto  Mr  Rai's point, even though it is not quite the same.   But\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion  is  to change the structure  of  the  Court  of\r\n\r\nAppeal.   I  think Mr Rai's suggestion is in the  numbers,  that\r\n\r\nthere  should be more Judges of appeals to be appointed  to  the\r\n\r\nCourt of Appeal.  My reply to that would be, in terms of how the\r\n\r\nCourts are structured, especially in terms of the Judges to  man\r\n\r\nthe Courts, it would be better to leave it to the Chief Justice,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is  the man on the spot.  He is in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the courts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  he  knows  the situation best.  So I am confident  that  he\r\n\r\nwould  take  into account matters such as the present  workload,\r\n\r\ncase  load  and demands of the Court of Appeal as  well  as  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  crop of Judges and Judicial Commissioners in  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  when he makes decisions as to whether or not there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  restructure or increase the number of  Judges  in  the\r\n\r\nCourt  of Appeal.  That is my response to Mr Jeyaretnam  and  Mr\r\n\r\nRai.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also knows that as and when there is a need to\r\n\r\nconstitute  a larger Court of Appeal, that has been  done.   The\r\n\r\nSupreme  Court  of Judicature Act provides that  the  civil  and\r\n\r\ncriminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal can be exercised by\r\n\r\nthree or any greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal.  So even\r\n\r\nif  the  norm is three Judges, the point is that the CJ has  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion,  which he has exercised before,  to  have  a  larger\r\n\r\nCourt  of  Appeal.  So I think this works best because there  is\r\n\r\nflexibility.   Let us not disturb that.  The best  thing  is  to\r\n\r\nleave  it  to  the judgement of the Chief Justice to  decide  on\r\n\r\nmatters like this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also asked about private summonses involving family\r\n\r\nmembers or neighbours and whether these should be handled by the\r\n\r\ncommunity  mediation centres.  The first point to note  is  that\r\n\r\nthe  CMC,  currently structured, is set up not  to  replace  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts in handling these neighbourly or  relational\r\n\r\ndisputes  arising  from private summonses.   Here,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nflexibility  whereby if the parties agree,  the  magistrate  can\r\n\r\nrefer  these  disputes which come before him  to  the  community\r\n\r\nmediation centres.  Indeed, this has been done.  There have been\r\n\r\n62  referrals  so  far.  The Crime Registry of  the  Subordinate\r\n\r\nCourts,  I  think Mr Rai also knows, also undertakes  mediation.\r\n\r\nWhen parties come before it to file a private summons, they will\r\n\r\nlook  at it and in fact they also actively utilise mediation  to\r\n\r\nassist  disputants  in  relational  disputes  to  resolve  their\r\n\r\ndisputes amicably, instead\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof just issuing private summonses immediately.  I am told that a\r\n\r\nsummons is issued only if there is absolutely no prospect of  an\r\n\r\namicable  resolution  and  the  parties  insist  on  proceeding.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  over  the years, the Subordinate Courts  have  formally\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised   mediation   to   deal   with    magistrates'\r\n\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is important. The concept of mediation, in the\r\n\r\ncontext of these relational dispute cases which come before  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts, is being used.  But the point now is, should\r\n\r\nwe  go  a  step  further so as to bring these  disputes  to  the\r\n\r\nground,  to be mediated by the CMCs.  My reply is that  we  have\r\n\r\nmade a good start.  The CMC is about a year now, and so far,  62\r\n\r\nreferrals have taken place.  I am sure that when more  CMCs  are\r\n\r\nset  up  on  the  ground,  so  that  it  is  better  distributed\r\n\r\ngeographically  and more accessible to residents,  more  can  be\r\n\r\ndone.  Indeed to encourage this, what we will do is the Ministry\r\n\r\nis considering a computer link-up between the Subordinate Courts\r\n\r\nand  the  CMCs so that the details of the parties and the  dates\r\n\r\nfor  mediation can be worked out whilst the parties are  at  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate Courts.  This will facilitate mediation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community mediation on a national basis is still evolving.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has made mediation voluntary to  encourage  its\r\n\r\nwider  use.   In  due  course, when mediation  has  become  more\r\n\r\nacceptable  and  is more widely used to resolve  such  community\r\n\r\nrelational  disputes, we may consider making  it  mandatory  for\r\n\r\nthese relational and neighbourly disputes to be mediated at CMCs\r\n\r\nbefore a private summons will be issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Claire Chiang made some very useful suggestions which I\r\n\r\nam grateful for and which I will relay to the Subordinate Courts\r\n\r\nto  consider.  Her main point is that she is concerned about the\r\n\r\nuse  of  mediation, particularly in family violence  cases,  and\r\n\r\nasked  whether that would be effective.  I understand  from  the\r\n\r\nSubordinate  Courts  that  there is  a  difference  between  the\r\n\r\nintervening  process which has been established  in  the  Family\r\n\r\nCourt and mediation per se.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counselling, not mediation, is the main intervention\r\n\r\nprocess employed in family violence cases.  Even before deciding\r\n\r\nwhether  to counsel a family violence case, I am told  that  the\r\n\r\nFamily    Court's   professional   counsellor   evaluates    the\r\n\r\nrelationship between the two parties and the merits and value of\r\n\r\ncounselling.   Any  imbalance in power and control  between  the\r\n\r\nparties is considered in the evaluation which, I think,  is  Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire   Chiang's   point,  particularly  in   family   violence\r\n\r\nsituation.   It  is an important consideration  because  if  the\r\n\r\nabused  party  is a spouse and, in particular,  a  female,  this\r\n\r\npoint about power and control should be considered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Court's practice with regard to counselling and\r\n\r\nmediation in cases where family violence has occurred takes  the\r\n\r\nfollowing   into  account.   Firstly,  parties   can   terminate\r\n\r\ncounselling  or mediation at any time, and they are  told  about\r\n\r\nthis  at  the  outset.   Secondly, the  applicant's  safety  and\r\n\r\nongoing protection is a paramount consideration.  Thirdly, court\r\n\r\ncounsellors and the Judges are fully aware of the possible power\r\n\r\nand  balance between the parties.  And finally, the  court  does\r\n\r\nnot condone the use of violence.  Nevertheless, the Family Court\r\n\r\nis  aware  that  not  all cases are suitable  for  mediation  or\r\n\r\ncounselling.   Professional counsellors make this assessment  at\r\n\r\nthe  intake session.  For example, counselling or mediation will\r\n\r\nnot be conducted if either party does not agree to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, mediation is seldom conducted in cases involving\r\n\r\napplications  for protection orders where the key  consideration\r\n\r\nis the applicant's safety.  This is a valid point because if the\r\n\r\nparty  is seeking a protection order, that means she is  at  her\r\n\r\nwit's  end,  she  wants  protection, not mediation.   The  court\r\n\r\nrecognises the plight of the spouse, in particular, if she is  a\r\n\r\nwoman  in  this situation.  To further assist the  applicant  in\r\n\r\nsuch  cases where protection orders are issued, they are  served\r\n\r\nto  the  parties within one day.  She will also  be  aware  that\r\n\r\nbreaches  of  protection orders are regarded  seriously  by  the\r\n\r\ncourts.   The party against whom the order is served is given  a\r\n\r\nnotice to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlet  him  know  what  he  ought  not  to  do,  clear  sentencing\r\n\r\nprinciples have been pronounced by the criminal courts  in  such\r\n\r\ncases.    All  this  underscores  the  court's  awareness   that\r\n\r\nmediation  should  not  be undertaken  at  the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\napplicant's, normally the wife's, sense of safety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude this part by assuring her that the Family\r\n\r\nCourt  takes its task very seriously.  It draws on all resources\r\n\r\nand  I  understand that it has also engaged consultants to  give\r\n\r\nseminars  on  how  to utilise mediation effectively.   So  every\r\n\r\nmeasure is constantly and carefully evaluated over time and fine-tuned  and that is where Mdm Chiang's suggestions will  come  in\r\n\r\nuseful.  The system is not perfect but the resolve of the courts\r\n\r\nis  to use mediation effectively so that the problem can also be\r\n\r\naddressed effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I just want to mention one point because\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam  earlier on in his speech  also  alluded  to  the\r\n\r\nearlier  debate when we amended the Supreme Court of  Judicature\r\n\r\nAct.   I  want to say that the Chief Justice, in his Opening  of\r\n\r\nthe  Legal  Year  speech,  gave the assurance  that  the  recent\r\n\r\namendments  are not to prevent access to justice  and  that  the\r\n\r\nright  of  appeal is not lost.  He also said that he would  keep\r\n\r\nthe  matter  under review and, if necessary, would recommend  to\r\n\r\nthe President to vary the limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> As Mr Jeyaretnam is not around to tell us\r\n\r\nwhat he wants to do with this amendment, I will therefore put it\r\n\r\nto the vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $59,293,090 for Head E ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $332,379,800 for Head E ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head B -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head B - Attorney-General's Chambers.

I  have  in  mind  people  who  are  involved  in\r\n\r\nlegislation  and  who  are dealing with corporate  matters.   It\r\n\r\nwould be good for them to be attached to some of these big firms\r\n\r\nwhere they have good exposure.  I must declare my interest as  a\r\n\r\nlawyer, Sir.  But I am thinking in the long-term interest of the\r\n\r\nlegal profession as well as the administration of justice, and I\r\n\r\nwould urge the Minister to give this his consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on Mr Rai's first point on the\r\n\r\nuse  of plain English, I am sure Mr Rai would be pleased to know\r\n\r\nthat  the AG's Chambers have indeed been using the plain English\r\n\r\napproach to legal drafting for some time.  In fact, the  AG  has\r\n\r\nbeen  concerned  with  this.   As early  as  January  1996,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Academy of Law (OSAL) held a series of  workshops  to\r\n\r\npromote the use of plain English in legal drafting conducted  by\r\n\r\nexperts  from Australia.  In his keynote address at the Opening,\r\n\r\nthe AG emphasised the importance of plain English drafting.   He\r\n\r\nmentioned  that he had instructed the legislative  draftsmen  to\r\n\r\nadopt  plain English in legislative drafting without sacrificing\r\n\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chambers have also adopted the policy of drafting\r\n\r\nlegislation in plain English whenever it is feasible to  do  so.\r\n\r\nOne initiative is the redrafting of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprescribed  forms for the sale and purchase of  residential  and\r\n\r\ncommercial properties under the Housing Developers (Control  and\r\n\r\nLicensing) Act and the Sale of Commercial Properties Act.  These\r\n\r\nforms in plain English have been in use since October 1997.  The\r\n\r\nChambers were also involved in 1998 in assisting the Law Society\r\n\r\nin  redrafting the Law Society's standard Conditions of Sale  of\r\n\r\nReal   Property  in  plain  English.   This  is   an   important\r\n\r\ndevelopment of plain English in legal drafting in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Revision Commission, chaired by the AG, has in its\r\n\r\nrevision of statutes and subsidiary legislation, also taken  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to weed out archaic and obsolete terms used  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  legislation.  The Commission has also simplified  such\r\n\r\nlegislation  by  breaking down long and complex  sentences  into\r\n\r\nshorter  paragraphs and subsections.  Headings  have  also  been\r\n\r\nused  instead  of side notes for easier reading.   In  addition,\r\n\r\nMembers would find it easier to understand a Bill by reading its\r\n\r\nExplanatory Statement first.  The purpose of the Statement is to\r\n\r\nexplain   in  plain  English  the  intention  of  each  proposed\r\n\r\nprovision  in the Bill in a precise manner.  I understand  that,\r\n\r\nto further facilitate the understanding of the provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill,  the  Chambers is considering in future preparing  a  more\r\n\r\nelaborate  Explanatory  Statement to a  Bill  so  that  it  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate easier reading and understanding of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point Mr Rai made is with regard to assigning of\r\n\r\ncases by the AG's Chambers to civil firms.  The position is that\r\n\r\nthe  AG's  Chambers  will assign cases to legal  firms  whenever\r\n\r\nthere is a need to do so.  However, Mr Rai also knows that  most\r\n\r\nof  the  civil  cases that AG currently handles involve  matters\r\n\r\nlike  debt  collection and motor accidents involving Government-owned vehicles.  It is uneconomical to assign these cases to the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.  However, the point is that whenever there is  a\r\n\r\nneed to do so, the AG's Chambers will do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is that, because there is little litigation on\r\n\r\nprivate matters, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAG  is  considering sending Legal Officers for  attachment  with\r\n\r\nprivate law firms to gain experience in civil work.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Mr Rai, do you wish to withdraw your\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Yes, I wish to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $26,855,240 for Head B ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $6,928,900 for Head B ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chairman:</b> Head N - Ministry of Finance.

Technopreneurs  typically have  many  ideas  and,  as  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  during  the debate on the Budget  Statement,  getting\r\n\r\nfunds is a big challenge in the current Singapore environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an entrepreneur is successful in attracting venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists, typically because of the large investments  needed,\r\n\r\nthe entrepreneur's share of the company could be grossly diluted\r\n\r\nif  he  does  not have a significant amount of his own  cash  to\r\n\r\ninvest, which is typically the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, there is a vibrant environment of many new\r\n\r\ncompanies,  especially in the Hsin Chu Science-based  Industrial\r\n\r\nPark.   Technopreneurs are able to source  funds  easily  either\r\n\r\nthrough  venture capitalists or by quickly turning around  their\r\n\r\ninvestments  in  companies.   There is such a thing  as  a  grey\r\n\r\nmarket where shares can be traded the day the company is formed.\r\n\r\nThe  buy  and  sell prices for such company shares are  in  fact\r\n\r\npublished in local newspapers for the public to trade  in  these\r\n\r\nshares.  The end result is that they have a quick turnaround and\r\n\r\navailability  of  funds  for new start-ups.   Entrepreneurs  can\r\n\r\ntherefore multiply their funds for use in new projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In USA, for such high-tech companies, the fast track\r\n\r\ninitial  public offering channel was created some years  ago  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up the Nasdaq Board. This Board does not have stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements of a track record of revenue, profit or  size.   As\r\n\r\nlong  as there is a good portfolio of technology and ideas  with\r\n\r\npossible future growth potential, companies are allowed to raise\r\n\r\nfunds through the Nasdaq.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, listing of companies to raise funds takes a\r\n\r\nvery  long time and hence the cycle time of new companies to  be\r\n\r\nstarted up is much longer, since the funds are tied up for  long\r\n\r\nperiods of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the following suggestions for the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Make it easier to list technological start-up companies\r\n\r\nwhere intellectual property and a potential business plan become\r\n\r\nthe deciding criteria.  Of course, the public must be made aware\r\n\r\nof  the high risk nature of such companies and leave it to  them\r\n\r\nto  decide  if they want to invest.  In fact, I suggest,  for  a\r\n\r\nstart,  we  use  our  second  Board,  Sesdaq,  by  allowing  two\r\n\r\ncategories of companies to raise funds on this Board - one group\r\n\r\nfollowing  existing  rules and the other that  allows  the  fast\r\n\r\ntrack criteria that I have talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Make it easier for private venture capitalists to raise\r\n\r\nfunds  from  the  public.  We should allow open fund-raising  of\r\n\r\nsuch high risk funds, once again by making it known to potential\r\n\r\ninvestors the high risk nature of such funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many rich individuals in Singapore who may\r\n\r\nnot have the ideas but who may be willing to participate in such\r\n\r\nfunds.   So  I  hope  that the Ministry would  look  into  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, last year, I\r\n\r\nspoke  on  the need to promote high-tech industry to  bring  our\r\n\r\neconomy  up  the value ladder.  I also asked the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider providing more incentives for the private equity funds,\r\n\r\nincluding those for boutique\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfunds.   I  am truly glad that the Government has acted  swiftly\r\n\r\nand put this in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I have one more item on my wish list, which is the\r\n\r\nsame  as  what  Mr  Inderjit Singh has asked for  and  that  is,\r\n\r\nSingapore  should have a stock exchange for high-tech  industry.\r\n\r\nLet  me  explain  why I wish there was one.   In  the  midst  of\r\n\r\npromoting technopreneurship, Singapore set up the basic physical\r\n\r\ninfrastructure such as a high-tech park near NUS, it pumps money\r\n\r\ninto  R&D,  the use of network with world renowned universities.\r\n\r\nBut for those who are familiar and who could embrace technology,\r\n\r\nall  these are wonderful things.  But our society has  not  been\r\n\r\noriented this way.  Many of us still do not know or simply  fear\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Quite many of us cannot even define  a  knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, there is a need to systematically educate our people.\r\n\r\nI  know  the  schools  are teaching the  kids  to  be  computer-literate.  Our younger workforce also learns about IT in schools\r\n\r\nor  on  the job.  But there is a large pool of people out  there\r\n\r\nwho  may not be comfortable with technology and many of them  do\r\n\r\nnot  even  know  how to log on to a user-friendly computer,  let\r\n\r\nalone  convincing  them to learn about cyber transactions,  gene\r\n\r\nsplicing  and  growing artificial human organs.  This  group  of\r\n\r\npeople in our society, however, represents the wealthy.  Many of\r\n\r\nthem  belong  to  the  baby  boom  generation  or  even  earlier\r\n\r\ngenerations.  They have made and accumulated substantial  wealth\r\n\r\nduring the good years in our nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, 40% of the economy is high-tech. Many companies\r\n\r\nwere  started  by returning scientists who came  up  with  their\r\n\r\npeers  who  succeeded in other businesses.  In Israel, high-tech\r\n\r\nbusinesses also boom due to their Jewish connections in USA.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore, we probably lack all these connections.  Therefore, I\r\n\r\nthink a stock exchange for high-tech industry would be useful to\r\n\r\nraise  funds  for promising start-ups to expedite  the  flow  of\r\n\r\ninformation   between   the  technologists   and   the   wealthy\r\n\r\nbusinessmen to attract talents from overseas and who hope to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nraise  funds  here  and to position ourselves  for  the  venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists to operate here.  And, hopefully, we can modify  the\r\n\r\nrisk-averse culture of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we are now too early and too small to have a full-fledged high-tech exchange, let alone to challenge Nasdaq. But,\r\n\r\nlike  all financial centres, there can be more than one in  this\r\n\r\nworld.   Singapore can well be such a centre  for  Asia  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Without  getting started, we  probably  would  not  be\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I suggest that Government look into the possibility of\r\n\r\nsetting  up  facilities similar to bulletin boards or  over-the-counter  in America, and these details have been covered  by  Mr\r\n\r\nSingh  earlier.   This may not form part of the existing  Sesdaq\r\n\r\nand it is up to the Ministry to structure it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, please allow me to quote a few figures to let the\r\n\r\nHouse have a feel of how much wealth such exchange can create in\r\n\r\nthe future.  As at yesterday, I called up a stockbroker at 5  pm\r\n\r\n-  Yahoo! had a market capitialistaion of US$33 billion; America\r\n\r\nOn-line  had a market capitalisation of US$85 billion.   Another\r\n\r\nhighflying bio-tech company, the Human Genome Science  is  worth\r\n\r\nUS$715 billion and, of course, our Creative Technology is  worth\r\n\r\nabout US$1.2 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have $100 billion in reserves, which is equivalent to\r\n\r\ntwo  Yahoos!   We  took 33 years to build up  $100  billion  and\r\n\r\nYahoo!  took  four  years to get half of  it.   Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nInternet  stocks  are  now very high  and  there  is  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nspeculation on it.  So, this comparison may not be fair but  the\r\n\r\ncontrast  is very stark and makes one feel that besides building\r\n\r\nour  physical infrastructure, we should find ways to  churn  out\r\n\r\nour national resources and to combine with outside resources  so\r\n\r\nthat  this exchange can expedite the growth of our wealth.  With\r\n\r\ngood  planning and some good luck, we may be able to double  our\r\n\r\nwealth in a shorter period.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If what Mr Chuang said\r\n\r\nis  correct, then I think the PAP Government is not  up  to  the\r\n\r\nstandard.  Yahoo! took 2 years and we took more than 30 years!\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Government encouraged the people of Singapore to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  shares, Singaporeans from all walks of life  happily\r\n\r\njumped  on  the  band wagon, with the hope that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould create wealth for them through the share market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many loyal Singaporeans believed that all activities they were\r\n\r\nencouraged  by  the  Government to participate  in  would  bring\r\n\r\nbenefits to them. This time round, they have their fingers, some\r\n\r\neven have their hands, burnt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most innocent ones are those who bought Malaysian shares\r\n\r\nfrom  the  CLOB  share  market.  Since  the  Stock  Exchange  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (SES) announced in September last year to close  down\r\n\r\nthe CLOB market which had made lots of money for the SES and the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  the  past 8 years, those investors  who  bought\r\n\r\nMalaysian  shares could only lament their bitterness before  the\r\n\r\nheaven.  All their investments are stuck, and they have  no  way\r\n\r\nof knowing when they will see the light of day again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government who has all along self-proclaimed to be\r\n\r\nbrilliant and capable, pushed the blame to the people  and  said\r\n\r\nthat  the people should  have recognised the risk of investment.\r\n\r\nWhat  I want to point out is that the situation here is not  one\r\n\r\nof  the  usual risks involved in investment.  The fact  here  is\r\n\r\nthat,  this CLOB market, as set up by the SES, has the  inherent\r\n\r\nrisk  of  collapse of the whole market system itself.   This  is\r\n\r\nnot  the type of risk which people describe as the risk of being\r\n\r\neaten  up  by  the crocodile as one enters the \"crocodile  pit\".\r\n\r\nNow, the whole crocodile pit is disintegrated.  Everything is in\r\n\r\na quandary and heaven knows when it is going to settle down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government did not care about the super-risk the investors\r\n\r\nwere  facing,  neither did they heed the Malaysian  Government's\r\n\r\nrepeated  warning that this market was illegal, and went  on  to\r\n\r\noperate  it  for  8 years.  It was only when the Government  was\r\n\r\nforced  into  an impasse that it was thrown into  confusion  and\r\n\r\nleft  it  to run its own course.  As a result, the fate  of  the\r\n\r\ninvestors'  share capital is now left entirely in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment.  You call this a responsible Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st August 1998, approximately 200,000 investors were\r\n\r\naffected and most of them were Singaporeans.  Since the collapse\r\n\r\nof this CLOB market some half a year ago, apart from apologising\r\n\r\nhastily  to  the  investors, the SES took  no  further  positive\r\n\r\naction.  The Government also seems to have washed its hands  off\r\n\r\nthe  matter,  and it leaves the Singapore investors  who  bought\r\n\r\nMalaysian shares at the mercy of the Malaysian Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what measures this self-proclaimed\r\n\r\nbrilliant,   capable,  far-sighted  and  highly  efficient   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  going  to  adopt  to  protect  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean investors who invested in Malaysian shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the PAP Government has been advocating Total Defence\r\n\r\nall the time.  But, have we done enough in our economic defence?\r\n\r\nWhy is it that all of a sudden, the investment by the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  their homeland has become the  sacrifice  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical wrestle between Singapore and Malaysia, and  even  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  capital  has  gone into  the  hands  of  a  foreign\r\n\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, there are two buzzwords today in\r\n\r\nSingapore: competitiveness and globalisation.  In achieving  the\r\n\r\ngoals  represented by these two words, Singapore has decided  to\r\n\r\ngo  into  the  promotion and development of e-commerce  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of Singapore as an intelligent island plugged  into\r\n\r\nthe  world.   But  in  the world of e-commerce  with  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices going one way, there is a need for payment to come  the\r\n\r\nother  way  to  complete  the circle.  Currently,  however,  for\r\n\r\nInternet  commerce, we do have a bottleneck, and that bottleneck\r\n\r\nis  because  we  have  effectively  only  one  Internet  payment\r\n\r\nprovider,  ie,  NETS,  a  cartel of banks.   NETS  is  the  only\r\n\r\nprovider and it is a very high cost provider, understandably  so\r\n\r\nbecause they have invested a lot of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoney into their systems.  Some of these systems are, of course,\r\n\r\nincreasingly  getting  obsolete because  of  the  fast  pace  of\r\n\r\ntechnology development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NETS has done a good job in helping Singapore to be placed\r\n\r\nin the world of e-banking and e-commerce, but I think it is fast\r\n\r\nlosing  its  competitiveness.  We do not want it to  become  the\r\n\r\nhare that  lost the race to the tortoise.  When its services are\r\n\r\nhigh  cost, it means that a  lot of SMEs that we want to develop\r\n\r\ninto  e-commerce players have got this problem of not being able\r\n\r\nto  pay  the  cost.  For example, banks would charge transaction\r\n\r\ncharges   of  4-6%  per  transaction  and  require   a   minimum\r\n\r\ntransaction  of $50,000 per month, and there are lots  of  other\r\n\r\nsums  involved  too  with the software and  acquisition  of  the\r\n\r\nhardware and so on.  These are sums that no businessman would go\r\n\r\ninto  if he wants to do e-commerce and then have to pay for  the\r\n\r\nInternet payment services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, besides the fact that obsolete technology can leave us\r\n\r\nbehind,  there is also this problem of being isolated  from  the\r\n\r\nworld,  because if we are intent on only developing  one  system\r\n\r\nthat  does not want to move forward, then we would end up  being\r\n\r\nisolated from the world.  And this would mean that the lead that\r\n\r\nwe  have  achieved would be lost.  As an example, NETS  was  the\r\n\r\nfirst  smart  card  in  the payment  world.   It  has  now  been\r\n\r\novertaken by quite a few other international services  like  the\r\n\r\nBelgian  Proton, like Mondex, Maestro and there  is  the  CIRRUS\r\n\r\nnetwork  and  other  systems all over the world  that  may  soon\r\n\r\novertake  some of the things that NETS has developed a lead  in.\r\n\r\nI  would therefore call for a re-thinking of this monopoly  that\r\n\r\nis currently present and allowing perhaps for non-bank clearers.\r\n\r\nIn the Internet, everything is equal.  All small and big players\r\n\r\nwould be on a playing field that is level and therefore it might\r\n\r\nbe  possible to have a small, agile payment provider that is not\r\n\r\na  bank, or perhaps even a foreign bank provider or a consortium\r\n\r\nof  foreign banks that could give NETS competition and a run for\r\n\r\nits money.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, Mr Shriniwas Rai asked about the\r\n\r\nSingapore dollar, its value is declining, how do we protect  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  the  Singapore dollar.  The  Singapore  dollar  is  a\r\n\r\nfloating  currency.  It is a managed float, but, basically,  its\r\n\r\nvalue  is  determined by the market supply and demand.   Against\r\n\r\nthe US dollar, it has depreciated maybe 20-odd percent since the\r\n\r\ncrisis  began in July 1997.  But on a trade weighted  basis,  if\r\n\r\nyou  take  an  average of a basket of all our trading  partners'\r\n\r\ncurrencies,  in  fact, the exchange rate has remained,  more  or\r\n\r\nless,  stable.  It went up somewhat over a period of a  year  or\r\n\r\nso, and it has gradually come down and it is now more or less at\r\n\r\nthe  starting  point.  So I do not think that the exchange  rate\r\n\r\nhas  depreciated  sharply.  The best guarantee of  the  exchange\r\n\r\nrate  is  a  strong economy, high domestic savings, no excessive\r\n\r\nforeign  borrowings,  confidence  by  foreign  parties  and   by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the economy and in the currency.  If people lose\r\n\r\nconfidence in your currency, then you are finished.  And if your\r\n\r\ndomestic  population lose confidence in your currency,  you  are\r\n\r\neven  more finished, because you will never have enough reserves\r\n\r\nto  stump  up  when  Singaporeans come and  say,  \"Here  are  my\r\n\r\nSingapore dollars, I want to swop them for US dollars, Yen, Euro\r\n\r\nor whatever.\"  I think that the best protection of the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar   value  is  confidence  and  a  sound  set  of  economic\r\n\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for protection from speculators, we have never\r\n\r\nencouraged  speculation in the Singapore dollar.   We  watch  it\r\n\r\nquite  carefully, and if it deviates too far from what we  judge\r\n\r\nto  be  the fundamentals, MAS does not hesitate to intervene  in\r\n\r\norder  to  bring  it  back.  We have  not  had  to  do  so  very\r\n\r\nfrequently  and  I  think we have a good  credibility  with  the\r\n\r\nmarket.   If  we want to do something, we are not without  means\r\n\r\naltogether, and I think I do not have to say very much more than\r\n\r\nthat on this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai also asked about mergers of banks and what more we\r\n\r\ncan  do.  First of all, it is not within the Government's  power\r\n\r\nto compel local banks to merge.  They will assess for themselves\r\n\r\nwhether mergers are desirable for them, attractive\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  a strategy to stay competitive, or whether they prefer to go\r\n\r\non their own.  The most important incentive for rationalising is\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  we  are embarked irrevocably  on  a  course  of\r\n\r\nliberalising our domestic banking sector.  We have said that  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to do it over five years.  We have been working  out\r\n\r\nthe  specific  schemes, and MAS will be announcing  a  plan  and\r\n\r\nsteps to accomplish this next month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this is in motion, the dynamics will look after\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Because as the environment becomes more  open,  the\r\n\r\ncompetitive pressures will grow and there will be incentives for\r\n\r\nthe banks to rationalise, to get their own acts in order, to get\r\n\r\nplans  for  the  medium  and  long  term,  and  to  shift  their\r\n\r\nstrategies and approaches and rationalise things, which  perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  left be had they not been  under  such  great\r\n\r\npressure.   And if you were to look at what the banks have  been\r\n\r\ndoing  over the last few months, you will know that in fact  the\r\n\r\nice  has broken, and they are already taking steps.  It  is  not\r\n\r\njust  DBS  which has merged with POSBank, and is making business\r\n\r\nplans domestically and in the region.  OCBC has recruited a  new\r\n\r\nCEO from Hong Kong and explained to its staff its plans to raise\r\n\r\nreturns  on  its equity and service to customers, and  to  focus\r\n\r\ntheir business on retail banking.  OUB also has, I believe  they\r\n\r\ncall it OUB 21 plan, to improve their performance.  And all  the\r\n\r\nother  banks, I am sure, are making their calculations  on  what\r\n\r\nthey  should do in this new situation.  So there has to be  free\r\n\r\nplay.   On the one hand, people want us to encourage the private\r\n\r\nsector  to bloom.  On the other hand, they want us to  make  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector do things.  We find a judicious balance.  We have\r\n\r\nset  the  forces in motion and must now let them play themselves\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng and Mr Inderjit Singh asked about\r\n\r\nraising  money for start-ups and whether we need to  change  the\r\n\r\nrules  and  have  a  special exchange for  high-tech  start-ups.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  Sesdaq,  which  is SES's  second  board,  caters  to\r\n\r\nlistings  by  small and medium sized enterprises  which  include\r\n\r\ntechnological\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstart-ups.    Contrary   to   popular   impressions,    Sesdaq's\r\n\r\nrequirements  for  listing  are in  fact  very  basic  and  very\r\n\r\nflexible.  You do not need any minimum profit.  You do not  need\r\n\r\nany  issued  capital or operating history to seek a  listing  on\r\n\r\nSesdaq.   These requirements are simpler and less  onerous  than\r\n\r\nthose of other markets.  But the fact is that when people go  on\r\n\r\nto  Sesdaq,  they  do tend to try to have some  issued  capital,\r\n\r\noperating  history and so forth, because they find it easier  to\r\n\r\nget  investors  to  buy  shares in their company  if  they  have\r\n\r\nsomething to show, rather than just promises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES does not normally take very long to accept or reject a\r\n\r\nlisting  application, not more than 4-6 weeks.  But, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  issue  manager may need time to perform due  diligence  and\r\n\r\nprepare  the  company  for  the listing  before  submitting  the\r\n\r\napplication to SES.  How long the issue manager takes depends on\r\n\r\nthe  complexity of the case and whether any major  restructuring\r\n\r\nneeds to be done before the listing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had a Corporate Finance Committee last year to review\r\n\r\nthese issues amongst others, and they identified two impediments\r\n\r\nfor  start-up companies wishing to obtain a listing.   First  of\r\n\r\nall,  start-ups  find  it  difficult to  find  investment  banks\r\n\r\nwilling  to  manage and underwrite their share  issues,  because\r\n\r\nthere  is a perception that investors will not be interested  in\r\n\r\nbuying shares of start-up companies.  And when they are prepared\r\n\r\nto  underwrite, their fees are quite high, and higher than those\r\n\r\npaid by companies with track records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, compliance and due diligence costs, preparing the\r\n\r\nprospectus  and financial reports for an IPO, are expensive  and\r\n\r\nprohibitive,  unless you are raising a fairly  large  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney.   If  you  look at companies which list on  Nasdaq,  they\r\n\r\nraise  at  least US$50 million for the national market or  US$20\r\n\r\nmillion for the small capital market.  And this is quite  a  lot\r\n\r\nmore than the amounts raised by many companies here, even on the\r\n\r\nmain board.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Corporate Finance Committee has recommended\r\n\r\nthat  the  needs  of start-up companies be met  not  by  further\r\n\r\nrelaxing  compliance and due diligence standards on Sesdaq,  but\r\n\r\nby  establishing an Internet-based bulletin board to  facilitate\r\n\r\nmatching  the  needs  of  start-ups and those  of  sophisticated\r\n\r\ninvestors  and venture capitalists who register as  subscribers.\r\n\r\nThese investors are better able to understand the risks and  the\r\n\r\npotential  for  losses  of  investing  in  start-ups,  and  will\r\n\r\ncontractually acknowledge the risks involved.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nyou  sign, you know what you are doing.  If the money  is  lost,\r\n\r\nthis  was a gamble which you were prepared to take and are  able\r\n\r\nto stomach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start-ups may raise funds by selling their shares to small\r\n\r\ngroups of subscriber investors without having to comply with the\r\n\r\nusual  prospectus  requirements, and  so  lower  the  compliance\r\n\r\ncosts.  The bulletin board will cater to start-ups and companies\r\n\r\nthat  find  listing on Sesdaq uneconomical.  The Government  has\r\n\r\nagreed   with  this  recommendation  of  the  Corporate  Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee, and SES will study the feasibility of setting  up  an\r\n\r\nInternet-based bulletin board.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides addressing the financing concerns of high-tech\r\n\r\nstart-ups,  the Government has also set up the Technopreneurship 21\r\n\r\nCommittee,  to  look  into  the  creation  of  a  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  would allow nimble knowledge-based  high-tech\r\n\r\nenterprises to flourish.  And their initial recommendations  are\r\n\r\nexpected to be announced by the middle of the year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that while funding needs\r\n\r\nare  a  significant  issue to consider,  the  basic  problem  in\r\n\r\ntechnological start-ups is that you need entrepreneurs, you need\r\n\r\nideas,  you  need  the technology and the talent,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  a  company.  In other words, you need the  primary  pre-conditions  before all the supporting paraphernalia will  be  of\r\n\r\nhelp  to  you.  Otherwise, you will just be throwing money  away\r\n\r\nand  getting  no returns.  Many governments have tried  spending\r\n\r\nmoney  and  have  got no returns.  The fact that  we  have  $100\r\n\r\nbillion in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficial  reserves, it is not an argument for throwing it  away,\r\n\r\nbut  a  demonstration of how not throwing money away leaves  you\r\n\r\nwith good savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the high value of Internet stocks and the phenomenal\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  Amazon.com, I agree with what Mr  Low  Thia  Khiang\r\n\r\nsaid,   ie,  if  that  is  the  yardstick,  then  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  must admit to have done very badly.  But  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that  is a yardstick and I am not sure what is  going  to\r\n\r\nhappen with Internet stocks.  I would advise Singaporeans not to\r\n\r\nlook for quick schemes to double their wealth.\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has asked about Clob. Firstly, he said the\r\n\r\nGovernment encourages share ownership and people have  now  been\r\n\r\nburnt.  I should point out that we have never asked people to go\r\n\r\nand buy shares.  What we have done is to arrange share ownership\r\n\r\nthrough  Government  divestments through  an  asset  enhancement\r\n\r\nscheme through Singapore Telecom, later on Singapore Power,  PSA\r\n\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you buy other shares on the SES, then you have to make your\r\n\r\ndecisions  whether to go in or not, and whether the  shares  are\r\n\r\nworth  it or not, and when to sell.  If you buy shares on  Clob,\r\n\r\nthen  you  go in on the clear understanding that these  are  not\r\n\r\nSingapore  shares  subject  to Singapore  rules,  but  over-the-counter  shares bought and sold subject to rules which apply  in\r\n\r\nother  countries.  In this case, we are talking about  Malaysian\r\n\r\nshares  and  therefore subject to a different set of risks,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just  market  risks,  but the risk  of  the  market  itself\r\n\r\nbreaking  down  or  closing down, or  running  into  some  other\r\n\r\nproblems.   In  fact, every transaction slip which  Clob  issued\r\n\r\nwhen  it  was operating had a disclaimer at the bottom that  you\r\n\r\nare  taking  the risk and you have to know what you  are  doing.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  a significant number of Singaporeans,  including\r\n\r\nsome  who  really could not afford it, thought that Clob  was  a\r\n\r\ngood punt and found it more exciting that Singapore stocks,  but\r\n\r\nthere were risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low said we ignored warnings that Clob was illegal and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  were  irresponsible.  In  fact,  Clob  was  never\r\n\r\nillegal.   Clob  was an off-shore stock market  regulated  under\r\n\r\nSingapore   law  and  therefore  outside  the  jurisdiction   of\r\n\r\nMalaysian   law.    Therefore,  Clob  did  not   require   legal\r\n\r\nrecognition  and authorisation of the Malaysian  authorities  to\r\n\r\noperate.    That  Clob  was  not  recognised  by  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities  did not make it illegal for any investor,  in  fact\r\n\r\neven  for  Malaysian investors, to trade shares on  Clob.   Clob\r\n\r\noperated  like  any  other off-shore securities  market  in  the\r\n\r\nworld, and there were also Malaysian shares traded in other off-shore markets, for example, in London.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On its part, the SES has always ensured that Clob complied fully\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysian  law  where applicable.   All  Malaysian  shares\r\n\r\ntraded  on  Clob  were properly registered  and  deposited  with\r\n\r\nMalaysian Central Depository (MCD) in accordance with its  rules\r\n\r\nand  regulations.  The  CDP,  which  is  the  Singapore  Central\r\n\r\nDepository  of shares, complied fully with applicable  Malaysian\r\n\r\nlaw  in  its  relationship with MCD.   Otherwise, the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities   would  doubtless  have  promptly   rectified   the\r\n\r\nsituation  during  the  nine years when  Malaysian  shares  were\r\n\r\ntraded on Clob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Malaysians imposed new rules on 1st September and\r\n\r\nthen shortly thereafter imposed exchange controls, they actually\r\n\r\nchanged  the  rules and changed the scheme.  After  which,  Clob\r\n\r\nreassessed  the situation and found that it was  not  viable  to\r\n\r\ncontinue,  and suspended trading, and reached an agreement  with\r\n\r\nthe  KLSE  in September 1998 to expedite the migration  of  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors' shares to the investors' own securities accounts with\r\n\r\nthe   Malaysian  Central  Depository  in  accordance  with   the\r\n\r\nprocedures set out by the KL Stock Exchange at that time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDP signed an agreement with the Malaysian Securities\r\n\r\nClearing Automated Networks Services Sendiran Berhad (SCANS) for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.  The intention was that once the migration was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompleted  an  investor could trade his Clob shares  on  the  KL\r\n\r\nStock Exchange.  In other words, the SES signed an agreement  in\r\n\r\nwriting  with  the  KLSE  to facilitate the  migration  of  Clob\r\n\r\nshares,  the opening of accounts in Malaysia on the MCD and  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of their shares to these individual accounts  so  that\r\n\r\nindividual  Clob shareholders can trade them in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthe new Malaysian rules through Malaysian brokers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SES and CDP have done everything expected of them under\r\n\r\nthis agreement and they have been waiting for the Malaysians  to\r\n\r\ndo  their part.  We have asked SES to clarify the legal position\r\n\r\nand  their legal advice is that there is no ambiguity about  the\r\n\r\nlegal  position of Clob shareholders.  Clob investors are  legal\r\n\r\nowners of their Malaysian shares and they cannot be deprived  of\r\n\r\ntheir rights, including the rights to trade their shares on  the\r\n\r\nKL Stock Exchange eventually, subject to the same rules that the\r\n\r\nKLSE  imposes  on  foreign investors.   So  that  is  where  the\r\n\r\nposition  is.   Obviously  it  is an  unresolved  issue  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and Malaysia, which will be discussed further  at  the\r\n\r\nappropriate channels and forums.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Total Defence and whether we are paying enough\r\n\r\nattention  to economic defence, I think the Member has  a  valid\r\n\r\npoint.   On  the one hand, we want to encourage inter-dependence\r\n\r\nwith  our  trading partners, particularly with  our  neighbours.\r\n\r\nBecause  through  inter-dependence,  it  gives  both  sides   an\r\n\r\nincentive  to  work for mutual benefit.  On the other  hand,  we\r\n\r\nalso  have  to  reserve  our position and  have  some  fall-back\r\n\r\nposition in case inter-dependence does not work, so that we have\r\n\r\nsome  means to do it and go it alone.  We do this in many areas.\r\n\r\nThe  Stock Exchange is one where an issue has arisen, but  there\r\n\r\nare  also  other  areas.  Water is a good example  where  inter-dependence  is our preferred choice but, if necessary,  we  will\r\n\r\nnot be left helpless.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question from Dr Toh See Kiat on competition\r\n\r\nfor   Nets   and  also  Internet  banking.   As  part   of   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of our domestic banking market, MAS  is  studying\r\n\r\nforeign  banks'  access  to front and  back  end  infrastructure\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  support multi-purpose stored  value  cards  being\r\n\r\nissued  by foreign institutions.  We are studying this and  when\r\n\r\nwe announce our overall liberalisation package, this will be one\r\n\r\nof the items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign banks are already allowed to compete freely in the\r\n\r\nInternet  banking.   We have no restrictions  on  foreign  banks\r\n\r\nsetting  up  websites to market their services and Citibank  and\r\n\r\nStanChart,  for example, among others,  have their own  websites\r\n\r\nalready,  which offer Internet bill payment services for  retail\r\n\r\nand  corporate customers through inter-bank Giro system and also\r\n\r\nprovide credit card facilities for Internet merchants.   So  the\r\n\r\nbanks  already  do  some.   Non-banks  participate  in  Internet\r\n\r\ncommerce   either  as  merchants  or  infrastructure  providers.\r\n\r\nMerchants,  for example, FairPrice, National Computer  Services,\r\n\r\nSingapore Press Holdings or Golden Village, have access to their\r\n\r\npresent credit card and the cash card payment system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-bank infrastructure providers, which only provide back-end\r\n\r\nInternet payment processing are not regulated by MAS.  They  are\r\n\r\nnot  banks, so they are not allowed to issue stored value  cards\r\n\r\nbecause  these cards are really a form of deposits to the  banks\r\n\r\nand  we want to make quite sure that there is a good institution\r\n\r\nthere, properly regulated, so the institution would not fold up,\r\n\r\ntaking  the value of the cards with them.  We are not  going  to\r\n\r\nreview  this  part  of  the  policy  because  the  security  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  risks of Internet payments are still  not  yet  fully\r\n\r\nunderstood.   But  we  are monitoring it  closely,  particularly\r\n\r\ninternational developments in this area, to make  sure  that  if\r\n\r\nother  countries  have fresh developments in Internet  commerce,\r\n\r\nour laws stay up to date.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to seek\r\n\r\none clarification from the Deputy Prime Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, make it short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It seems to me that Singaporeans who\r\n\r\nhold  Malaysian shares now are being deprived of their right  to\r\n\r\ntrade  on the market by the Malaysian authorities.  How  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore going to help them?  Or are we going  to\r\n\r\nleave it as it is with no end to it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The shares remain the shares of the\r\n\r\nClob  shareholders.  As I have explained, there is an  agreement\r\n\r\nbetween  Clob and the KL Stock Exchange to make the arrangements\r\n\r\nfor  the shares to be traded.  The Singapore Stock Exchange  has\r\n\r\ndone its part. We are now awaiting for the KL Stock Exchange  to\r\n\r\ndo  their  part.  The Member would have noticed  that  when  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister met Prime Minister Mahathir in Hanoi in December,\r\n\r\nthey  talked  about the package of issues to  be  discussed  and\r\n\r\nresolved together as one bundle.   Clob was one of the items.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, earlier Mr Low Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang  mentioned  that  if  we were to  compare  the  Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy  with  the  Internet  stocks,  then  Singapore  has   no\r\n\r\nstandard.   Personally, I agree with what DPM said.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nappropriate to compare a company with a national economy.   This\r\n\r\nafternoon,  I  would  like to touch on the topic  of  long  term\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness because there is really a difference  between  a\r\n\r\nnational economy and a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company basically goes into business to make money. When\r\n\r\nthe  business  is good, the money is good, they move  into  that\r\n\r\nbusiness sector to make money.  When the situation changes, when\r\n\r\nthe  business is no good, the climate changes, they can get  out\r\n\r\nof  the  business and move on to somewhere else.  Many companies\r\n\r\nthat were around 20 years ago are not around today.  But in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of a country, a country cannot be opportunistic, a country\r\n\r\ncannot go into business just because things are good and get out\r\n\r\nof  business  and say that these are no longer  good.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause,  at  the end of the day, the Singapore economy  has  to\r\n\r\ncontinue for many more years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference is that in the case of a company, when\r\n\r\nit  moves  from one business to another business, it can  always\r\n\r\ndownsize the company and retrench all their workers.  But in the\r\n\r\ncase of a national economy, as we restructure, as we upgrade our\r\n\r\neconomy,  we would have to continue to live with the  same  work\r\n\r\nforce, the younger ones and the older ones.  As long as they are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  we  will have to travel the journey  of  economic\r\n\r\nprogress together with them as one united team.  In this regard,\r\n\r\nmy  concern is this:  as we move into a knowledge-based  economy\r\n\r\nin  the future, we have to help as many Singaporeans as possible\r\n\r\nto upgrade and to be transformed into knowledge workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I agreed fully with what the Minister mentioned,\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Government is doing a lot  to  upgrade  and\r\n\r\nretrain  the workers through the SDF, SRP, ETF and INTECH.   But\r\n\r\nmy  concern is that whatever we are doing up till now may not be\r\n\r\nenough  to help our Singaporean workforce to upgrade fast enough\r\n\r\nto  keep  in  pace with this evolution towards a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   If  we  are not able to upgrade our entire  workforce\r\n\r\nfast  enough,  in  five  to ten years  from  now,  many  of  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  workers  are going to become  a  liability  in  our\r\n\r\neconomy  and a liability in our society.  But if we are able  to\r\n\r\nact  fast enough and transform as many of them as possible  into\r\n\r\nknowledge  workers,  they can turn into  a  national  asset  and\r\n\r\nbecome  the source of driving force to push our economy  further\r\n\r\nin a knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This afternoon I just want to put up a very simple request.\r\n\r\nIn  the  past,  we  granted  pioneer  status,  for  example,  to\r\n\r\ncompanies for job creation when we had high unemployment.  Later\r\n\r\non,  we  granted pioneer status to companies for  their  capital\r\n\r\ninvestment  when  we  moved  into a  capital-intensive  economy.\r\n\r\nLater  on, we granted pioneer status to companies based on total\r\n\r\nbusiness spending (TBS) because we wanted to capitalise  on  the\r\n\r\nregional market.  We want to encourage companies to set up  OHQ.\r\n\r\nIn the future, as we move into a knowledge-based\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy,  since  one of our key challenges is to  transform  our\r\n\r\nworkers  into  knowledge workers, can we not  consider  granting\r\n\r\npioneer  status and investment allowance to companies  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir    investment   in   manpower   redevelopment,   in    the\r\n\r\ntransformation of workers into knowledge workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to declare my interest\r\n\r\nin the trading business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, traders big and small, have contributed significantly\r\n\r\nto  our  economy.  Smaller traders have been successful in  non-traditional  markets and have developed interesting niche  areas\r\n\r\nwhere OEM or big suppliers have not been able to get into.   One\r\n\r\nof  the issues is that such companies in Singapore usually trade\r\n\r\nor  operate  in  risky  but profitable  second  or  third  world\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banks treat such small businesses like small \"sampans\"\r\n\r\nin  rough and choppy waters who are likely to be rocked or sunk.\r\n\r\nThe  banks  prefer to support big companies that  are  like  big\r\n\r\nboats or ships.  They rather prefer to support an ocean liner or\r\n\r\nsuper tanker sized big business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little do these banks realise that many of these sampans\r\n\r\nhave  very  strong jet engines that allow them to steer  out  of\r\n\r\ntroubled waters.  They are flexible and can move fast.   On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand, even the Titanic could not get out of trouble  fast\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the recent financial crisis, banks have become very\r\n\r\nconservative.  A lot of us have talked about this many times and\r\n\r\nmany  local companies, especially the smaller traders, have been\r\n\r\nbadly  hit  by cash flow problems.  Many have viable  businesses\r\n\r\nand  business  opportunities but lack the credit facilities  and\r\n\r\ncannot take advantage of the opportunities available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Minister look into the\r\n\r\nfollowing two areas:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a Government-funded trade financing scheme where\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can  provide  an LEFS-equivalent  scheme  using\r\n\r\ntraded  goods  as  security,  if necessary.  Alternatively,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment could arrange for some local and international  banks\r\n\r\nto undertake a minimum of, say, 3% to 5% of their loan portfolio\r\n\r\nto  such  traders  and, if loss is incurred, the  banks  can  be\r\n\r\nallowed to write off such bad debts with a double tax deduction.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, currently, countries like Hong Kong provide tax\r\n\r\nexemption  for third country trades done outside the country  by\r\n\r\nlocal  companies.  Can Singapore provide a similar incentive  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can encourage traders to remain in Singapore while they\r\n\r\nmanage such third country trades from here?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has come to my attention that in the last two\r\n\r\nyears,  many traders who operated out of Singapore have  decided\r\n\r\nto  relocate to countries like Dubai and Hong Kong for a  number\r\n\r\nof  reasons:  firstly, the cost of doing business  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere  our cost is between two and four times higher than  these\r\n\r\ncountries;  secondly, the inability to raise funds in Singapore;\r\n\r\nand thirdly, the restrictive tax practices in Singapore.  I hope\r\n\r\nwe can reverse this move by doing more for traders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to my next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Many Members have spoken about the need\r\n\r\nto  change our tax laws in this House for the last two days.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  consider  these  changes to be  competitive  with  tax\r\n\r\npractices  of countries around the world, with whom we  are  now\r\n\r\ncompeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past 30 years, the focus of our economy was largely\r\n\r\nto   bring  in  foreign  direct  investments  of  mainly   large\r\n\r\nmultinational corporations and on an industrialisation programme\r\n\r\nthat  brought  Singapore from an under-developed  to  an  almost\r\n\r\ndeveloped economy status.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we look into the future, we know that we have to\r\n\r\nchange  the  direction  and the approach  needed  to  bring  our\r\n\r\neconomy to the next stage of growth to sustain another 30  years\r\n\r\nof economic prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I talked about the three areas in the Budget debate,\r\n\r\nand  I  believe  that  we should focus on these  three,  namely,\r\n\r\npromoting  growth  through globalisation and searching  for  new\r\n\r\nmarkets through either greenfield investments or through mergers\r\n\r\nand acquisitions in the region or around the world; secondly, to\r\n\r\npromote  entrepreneurship or technopreneurship and  a  knowledge\r\n\r\nbased  economy; and thirdly, by encouraging a vibrant small  and\r\n\r\nmedium enterprises sector to emerge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve these, our tax laws have to be revamped to be\r\n\r\nmore  future  orientated.  Today, our system tries  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  so as to plug any loopholes, as  Mr  Heng  Chiang\r\n\r\nMeng  mentioned  yesterday.  In doing so, our laws  become  very\r\n\r\nrestrictive  just  because  we want  to  capture  a  handful  of\r\n\r\noccurrences of companies trying to benefit from these loopholes.\r\n\r\nThese restrictive rules then discourage and become obstacles for\r\n\r\ncompanies who genuinely need to grow and who can compete  around\r\n\r\nthe  world.  We should put in place rules that allow flexibility\r\n\r\nand  facilitate  the growth of these three  areas  that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a number of suggestions for the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  that will help in developing the areas of  our  economy\r\n\r\nthat   we  have  an  excellent  potential  for  growth.    These\r\n\r\nsuggestions  include  ideas  to facilitate  innovation  and  the\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial spirit, globalisation and the future  growth  of\r\n\r\nindustries where we have core competencies.  They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To promote entrepreneurship and to develop employee\r\n\r\nloyalty,  can the capital gain from stock options  be  made  tax\r\n\r\nexempt?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Similarly, many start-up companies emulating the examples in\r\n\r\nTaiwan are offering free shares, in fact, that are valued at par\r\n\r\nto employees,  Can these too be tax exempt?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some Members have talked about this. Currently income\r\n\r\nbrought   back  from  overseas  operations  is  fully   taxable,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  companies leaving their funds outside  Singapore.\r\n\r\nCan  we  make  it attractive for companies to bring these  funds\r\n\r\nback  for  use locally?  I suggest a tax equivalent to at  least\r\n\r\n50%  or less of the current corporate tax to encourage companies\r\n\r\nto  bring  their funds back into Singapore which could  then  be\r\n\r\nused for further investments.  Some revenue to the Government is\r\n\r\nbetter  than  zero  revenue, in the case where  income  is  left\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Group tax consolidation - where we allow the\r\n\r\noffsetting  of losses made within the group of a company.   This\r\n\r\nwill  help ease cash flow and will encourage regionalisation  by\r\n\r\nbreaking  value chains of operations rather than  by  completely\r\n\r\nmoving  the  whole operations out of Singapore.  In  the  second\r\n\r\ncase,  we  will actually have a loss to our economy  where  jobs\r\n\r\nwill  be  lost and all the value activities happen  outside  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we can encourage many more new ventures which\r\n\r\ntypically  are  loss making at an early stage  by  allowing  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Double tax deduction for the cost of regionalisation\r\n\r\nor  globalisation to encourage more companies to take  advantage\r\n\r\nof the good opportunities available in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Double tax deduction for cost of hiring from overseas\r\n\r\nto  encourage  foreign talent to be brought into  Singapore  who\r\n\r\ncould then be used for their global operations in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To exempt the value-added component from GST for\r\n\r\ncontract  manufacturers.   Such  businesses  enjoy  very   small\r\n\r\nmargins  of around 2%-4%, I believe, and the 3% GST can  make  a\r\n\r\nbig difference in pricing competitiveness if we compare them  to\r\n\r\nsimilar  companies in the region, like in Malaysia and Thailand.\r\n\r\nSir,  when  you have to pay for GST upfront and you  price  your\r\n\r\ngoods, you have to add the 3% in your pricing mechanism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Can we extend the bonded warehouse concept to\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, making them `bonded manufacturing  sites'?   This\r\n\r\nwill  help export orientated manufacturers.  In this way,  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  will be exempted from GST and the benefits  are  two-fold.  First of all, it helps to improve their cash flow because\r\n\r\ncurrently  the  time  taken to claim GST results  in  funds  not\r\n\r\nusable  as  working capital or for new investments.  The  amount\r\n\r\ncan  be quite substantial for large manufacturers.  For example,\r\n\r\nan  operation  that  does about $30 million of  purchases  in  a\r\n\r\nmonth, will have about $1 million taken off the system, and this\r\n\r\nis a substantial amount that could be invested for other things.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it will encourage such manufacturers to  buy  locally\r\n\r\nwithout  paying  GST  if  they are bonded  manufacturing  sites.\r\n\r\nThis, in turn, will help our local companies or distributors who\r\n\r\nnow  lose out to foreign suppliers who are the preferred sources\r\n\r\nfor such contract manufacturers because of the GST payment.   If\r\n\r\nthey  purchase  locally, they have to add the 3%  GST  on  their\r\n\r\npurchases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a concept exists in both Malaysia and Indonesia where\r\n\r\nthey  are  called  free  trade zone  or  licensed  manufacturing\r\n\r\nwarehouses.   I suggest we adopt the same approach  for  certain\r\n\r\nindustries, especially the contract manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, to give tax incentives to small venture\r\n\r\ncapitalists  that  can  help  fuel our  entrepreneurship  drive.\r\n\r\nCurrent incentives are only for big funds and I suggest that  we\r\n\r\ngive tax breaks for smaller funds that are willing to locate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, a few years ago, Government\r\n\r\nintroduced  tax provisions for property purchased  within  three\r\n\r\nyears.  If you sell the property, you have to pay tax.  This was\r\n\r\nto  check  speculation in the property market.  I think  it  was\r\n\r\ntimely.   But  the  time has come for the Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nwhether  this arrangement should still exist.  I would urge  him\r\n\r\nto  take away this legislative process or reduce it to less than\r\n\r\n30%.  I leave it to the Minister's discretion, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, allow me to add on\r\n\r\nto Mr Singh's comments on GST.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administration of the Goods and Services Tax has been a\r\n\r\nchallenge  to  cash  flow management for  many  SMEs.   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly so for those who manufacture or trade a combination\r\n\r\nof   domestic  and  imported  inputs  for  export  market.   The\r\n\r\ndifferent   treatments  frequently  mean  that  such   companies\r\n\r\nindirectly  bear  the cost of financing the GST payments  before\r\n\r\nthe  eventual reconciliation.  To illustrate, GST  is  paid  for\r\n\r\ninputs  and value-added whilst the offsetting comes only at  the\r\n\r\npoint of export.  With sluggish demand, the time difference  can\r\n\r\nsometimes stretch for months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with intensifying competition, margins are already\r\n\r\nbeing sliced very thin.  The administration of GST can therefore\r\n\r\nbecome a huge burden and sometimes mean the difference between a\r\n\r\nsmall profit and a loss.  Can the Minister therefore review  and\r\n\r\nstreamline the procedures for GST administration, especially for\r\n\r\nSMEs?   Can a greater grace period be allowed for such cases  so\r\n\r\nas  to  ease  cash  flow for companies, especially  during  this\r\n\r\ndifficult period?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, in October 1998, we amended the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act extensively to bring changes to our company law in\r\n\r\nan  attempt to keep it in line with developments of company  law\r\n\r\ntaking   place  elsewhere.   In  that  exercise,  we  took   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to, among other things, introduce the share buy-back\r\n\r\nscheme and to clarify the status of franchise for the purpose of\r\n\r\nsection 107 of the Companies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in October was part of a series of four\r\n\r\namendments in the last two years.  These amendments have brought\r\n\r\nabout  piecemeal changes but would appear to fall  short  of  an\r\n\r\noverhaul  of  our  Companies  Act  which  is  long  overdue   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The UK, Australia and New Zealand are among some  of\r\n\r\nthe jurisdictions that have undertaken an extensive overhaul  of\r\n\r\ntheir company legislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These jurisdictions appear to be ahead of us in company law\r\n\r\nreforms.   For instance, the United Kingdom now allows companies\r\n\r\nto  dispense  with  the obligation to provide the  common  seal.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  in  Australia,  the  government  has  in  place  the\r\n\r\nCorporate Law Economic Reform Programme (CLERP) which constantly\r\n\r\nexamines  the state of corporations law in Australia  and  makes\r\n\r\nproposals  for  reforms and refinements.   Some  of  the  recent\r\n\r\nproposals  made  by  CLERP include small business  fund  raising\r\n\r\nreforms  to  reduce  the  level of  disclosure  requirement  for\r\n\r\ncapital   raising   by   smaller  enterprises   and   also   the\r\n\r\nrationalisation  of  prospectus  requirements   and   liability,\r\n\r\nespecially with respect to small capital raising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that the reform in Australia has taken the\r\n\r\ndirection  of  making  it  easier  for  the  small  and   medium\r\n\r\nenterprises to raise limited funds.  In Singapore, we are trying\r\n\r\nto  establish ourselves as a financial centre in the region.  It\r\n\r\nis  imperative therefore that changes to the company law must at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time be kept in tandem with our plans to promote  the\r\n\r\nfinancial services in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has agreed to adopt most of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  made  by  the Finance Committee  regarding  the\r\n\r\nregulation of our securities industry.  A consistent move  in  a\r\n\r\nsimilar direction is also necessary in the area of company law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the following areas may be considered for\r\n\r\nreform:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) consideration of relaxing or removing the prohibition\r\n\r\nof  companies  from  providing financial assistance  in  certain\r\n\r\ncases;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) simplifying the registration process;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) reviewing the capital maintenance rule;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) simplification of amalgamation of companies;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) treatment of group companies; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) a reduction of the need for court approvals for\r\n\r\nvarious corporate decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in his reply to me in October, has indicated\r\n\r\nthat the Ministry is engaging in a massive exercise in which the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act  will be amended over a period of  time.   Rather\r\n\r\nthan carrying out piecemeal amendments, I would like to ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether a comprehensive overhaul of the Companies  Act\r\n\r\nmay be carried out and, if so, whether this can be completed  in\r\n\r\nthe next few years, in order that the new Companies Act can take\r\n\r\nus  well into the next millennium and help set the stage for  us\r\n\r\nto be a leading financial centre in this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I continue?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, the 1998 amendment has clarified\r\n\r\nthat  franchises are excluded from the ambit of section  107  of\r\n\r\nthe  Companies Act.  While this amendment seeks to  clarify  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of interest under section 107 of the Act,  I  submit\r\n\r\nthat the amendment has not gone far enough to clarify the proper\r\n\r\nambit of the section.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of division 6 of the Companies Act of which\r\n\r\nsection  107 is a part would appear to be to protect members  of\r\n\r\nthe public from being misled into participating in any interest;\r\n\r\nwhich for the purposes of the Act means any right to participate\r\n\r\nin  any  profits,  assets or realisation  of  any  financial  or\r\n\r\nbusiness   undertaking  or  scheme,  whether  in  Singapore   or\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  There is more in the definition but for the purposes\r\n\r\nof my remarks, this is just the gist of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 113 of the Act mandates that if an investment\r\n\r\nscheme falls within the definition of interest under the Act and\r\n\r\nan  offer is made to the public for subscription or purchase  of\r\n\r\nthat  interest, the company making such an offer  must  issue  a\r\n\r\nprospectus.   If  one looks at section 107,  the  definition  of\r\n\r\n\"interest\" is very broad and is capable of a wide import.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  there  could potentially  be  a  lot  of  financial\r\n\r\narrangements which would require the issuance of a prospectus.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the ambiguity of the section, we are not\r\n\r\ncertain  that some of the other investment schemes  fall  within\r\n\r\nthe  regulatory  ambit  of the Companies Act,  and  these  would\r\n\r\ninclude,  for  instance,  investment in  real  estate  overseas,\r\n\r\nbuying  of  time-share  interest  in  overseas  properties   and\r\n\r\nparticipation in ostrich farming in Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it turns out, real estate developers promoting foreign\r\n\r\nproperties in Singapore do not appear to be required by the  Act\r\n\r\nto  issue any statement in relation to the developments.   As  a\r\n\r\nconsequence,  many Singaporeans have found out  that  they  have\r\n\r\nmade  a  lemon of their investments in overseas properties  when\r\n\r\nthey discovered that the properties that they bought were either\r\n\r\nnot built or were shabbily constructed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it also seems strange to me that we see regularly in\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  invitations to members of the public to participate\r\n\r\nin   investments   in  ostrich  eggs.   Sir,  there   are   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who do not know the difference between a turkey and\r\n\r\nan  ostrich, or are they in a position to know the nature of the\r\n\r\ncompany they are investing in.  On the other hand, even a  well-established local company cannot begin to sell a share  publicly\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  without  having to  comply  with  the  prospectus\r\n\r\nrequirement under the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed a serious anomaly and I would urge the Ministry\r\n\r\nto  regularise this anomaly by seeking to regulate  the  various\r\n\r\ninvestment schemes that are now in place in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister for Finance whether\r\n\r\nmore  stringent  measures will be imposed on  those  seeking  to\r\n\r\npromote  investment  opportunities in  Singapore  which  are  at\r\n\r\npresent,  not  regulated  by  the Companies  Act  or  the  other\r\n\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have a few seconds left.
