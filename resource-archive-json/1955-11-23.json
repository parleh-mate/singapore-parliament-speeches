My  information is that the appointment\r\n\r\nin  the  Commissioner-General's Office  is  confined\r\n\r\nsolely  to Europeans, and the present holder of  the\r\n\r\noffice is a European.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I refer the Government to page 121, sub-head 1 (4) where there is an example of such a\r\n\r\npost - \"Principal Assistant Secretary to  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommerce  and Industry\" - which is an upper  timescale\r\n\r\npost?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer the Government also to page 216, sub-head\r\n\r\n1  (2) \"Principal Assistant Commissioner for Labour,\r\n\r\nClass II\" - an upper timescale post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these officers are taken to the Commissioner-General's Office on transfer from the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment    Establishment    and    the    Malayan\r\n\r\nEstablishment.  There is no reason, particularly  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the desire of the Government to  keep  all\r\n\r\ngovernment   expenditure,   whether   on    personal\r\n\r\nemoluments or other unnecessary expenditure, to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbarest  minimum,  for this post to be  upgraded.

D. Higham(Acting Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The   Chief  Secretary  (Mr  J.  D.

There is no question\r\n\r\nof  an  upgrading of these posts. I agree  that  the\r\n\r\ntide   of  Principal  Assistant  Secretary  is  used\r\n\r\nsomewhat  loosely  in  the  service.  It  does   not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  indicate posts of  the  same  grade  or\r\n\r\nimportance.  There  are  other  Principal  Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretary jobs in the service, including one that is\r\n\r\nheld  by  a  local  officer, that carry  superscale\r\n\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two particular posts in the Commissioner-General's Office are a backlog\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Ritsonisation. The Legislative Council  approved\r\n\r\nthe   Ritsonisation  of  all  superscale  posts   in\r\n\r\nGovernment   in  1954.  These  two  posts   in   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner-General's Office alone were left out of\r\n\r\nconsideration, because it was necessary for both the\r\n\r\nMalayan  and  Borneo  Governments  concerned  to  be\r\n\r\nconsulted   and   their  agreement   obtained.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government's  interest  in  these  posts,\r\n\r\nfinancially, is only to the extent of 22  per  cent.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time to get the Ritsonisation of\r\n\r\nthese two posts agreed. By the time it was done, the\r\n\r\nLegislative Council had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit here that there has been an error in\r\n\r\nthat   the   sanction  of  this  Assembly   to   the\r\n\r\nRitsonisation of these posts was not  sought  at  an\r\n\r\nearlier  time.  Had it been sought,  I  should  have\r\n\r\nasked  you,  Mr Chairman, to consider  ruling  this\r\n\r\nmotion out of order under Standing Order 33 (1)  (b)\r\n\r\nin that it would affect the emoluments already drawn\r\n\r\nby  an  existing officer. As it is, I can  only  say\r\n\r\nthat  there is no question of upgrading.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthe  total  pay that would have been paid had  these\r\n\r\nposts been substantively occupied would have been no\r\n\r\ngreater.  In  certain circumstances, it  might  even\r\n\r\nhave been less than under the pre-Ritson regime. The\r\n\r\nposts  have, in fact, not been substantively  filled\r\n\r\nbecause  the whole organisation of the Commissioner-General has been in a state of some uncertainty  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years  past and it was felt that  it  would\r\n\r\nhave  been improper to appoint substantive  officers\r\n\r\nto  these  superscale posts - posts that  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  superscale - and then find that  they  were  no\r\n\r\nlonger   required   in   the  Commissioner-General's\r\n\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am happy to\r\n\r\nhear  from the Chief Secretary that he is very  keen\r\n\r\nto  rule out any discussion on the question  of  pay\r\n\r\nfor European officers by invoking Standing Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

In the Estimates for 1955,\r\n\r\non  page  34,  there was provision  for  one  Senior\r\n\r\nAuditor and two Auditors. Now it is sought to create\r\n\r\ntwo  Senior Auditors and two Auditors. Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, if one looks at the 1955 Establishment List, on\r\n\r\npage  16, one finds these posts, which were  allowed\r\n\r\nin  1954,  set out as follows: Upper timescale,  one\r\n\r\nappointment,   Senior   Auditor;   timescale,    two\r\n\r\nappointments,  two  Auditors,  one  filled   by   an\r\n\r\nexpatriate, the other vacant. In other words,  there\r\n\r\nis  one Senior Auditor, the appointment being filled\r\n\r\nby an expatriate; two timescale posts, one filled by\r\n\r\nan expatriate, the other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvacant.  The  scale below that is a Div.  II  scale,\r\n\r\nfilled  by  a  local  man, who is  Senior  Assistant\r\n\r\nAuditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the Financial Secretary himself sent\r\n\r\nout  a circular recently to all heads of departments\r\n\r\nin  which he set out the view of the Government that\r\n\r\nthere   should  be  an  absolute  economy   in   new\r\n\r\nappointments.  The  Financial  Secretary,   in   his\r\n\r\ncircular of the 2nd of December, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Heads of departments are requested to re-examine\r\n\r\ntheir  draft estimates in order to determine whether\r\n\r\nEstimates of Revenue cannot safely be increased  and\r\n\r\nEstimates  of Expenditure substantially reduced.  In\r\n\r\nthis connection it is appreciated that Estimates  of\r\n\r\nExpenditure  have been prepared with  the  need  for\r\n\r\neconomy  clearly  in  view  and  have  already  been\r\n\r\nscrutinised in the Treasury. On the other  hand,  it\r\n\r\nwould be appreciated that the position, as disclosed\r\n\r\nby   the  Draft  Estimates,  gives  cause  for  much\r\n\r\nconcern. The co-operation of heads of departments in\r\n\r\nan  effort  to  close  the  gap  is  most  earnestly\r\n\r\nsought.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, in a special reference to Personal Emoluments, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Heads of departments are requested to examine\r\n\r\nall  proposals for new appointments with a  view  to\r\n\r\ndetermining whether they are, in fact, essential for\r\n\r\nthe   efficient   discharge  of  the   business   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  1956, and to withdraw any  proposals\r\n\r\nwhich  do  not strictly conform to this requirement.\r\n\r\nAgain  the  provision entered against  any  post  or\r\n\r\ncategory of posts should be examined with great care\r\n\r\nin  order  to  determine whether  the  total  amount\r\n\r\nentered will, in fact, be spent...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, we have here an attempt to\r\n\r\nboost  up the number of Senior Auditors from one  to\r\n\r\ntwo  and to maintain the number of Auditors  at  two\r\n\r\nwith no proportionate increase in the staff they are\r\n\r\nsupposed   to   supervise.  There  is  no   increase\r\n\r\nanywhere.  It  is not shown in these Estimates.  The\r\n\r\nnatural  result of the creation of one more post  of\r\n\r\nSenior  Auditor means that the expatriate holder  of\r\n\r\nthe post of Auditor will go up automatically because\r\n\r\nhe is the next person awaiting promotion. Then there\r\n\r\nwill  be two vacancies in auditorship which  may  be\r\n\r\nfilled by local men or may be filled by expatriates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is commonly known in the Civil Service amongst\r\n\r\nlocal  officers that this is a game  of  snakes  and\r\n\r\nladders. One boosts up a post there and pushes an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpatriate  up there. Then one brings  in  a  local\r\n\r\nofficer here. That is Malayanisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not the slightest need for creating one\r\n\r\nmore post of Senior Auditor. There is no increase in\r\n\r\nthe work to be done by Senior Auditors, and the only\r\n\r\njustification advanced by the Financial Secretary is\r\n\r\nthat  it  will really not cost us very much  because\r\n\r\nthe  extra money will be made up by external  audit,\r\n\r\nsince  this man will be going round auditing Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard   accounts   and  all  other   semi-government\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition feels very strongly that this\r\n\r\nquestion must be considered not only in the light of\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  the Chief Minister  to  reduce  all\r\n\r\nincreases in emoluments to the minimum, but also  in\r\n\r\nthe   light  of  the  sabotage  of  the  policy   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation to which the Government is committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, the Audit\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  perhaps one of  the  most  important\r\n\r\ndepartments of Government. In so far as  it  fulfils\r\n\r\nthe  same function for the Government as a  firm  of\r\n\r\nprivate accountants fulfils for companies registered\r\n\r\nunder  the  Companies Act, it  is  the  watchdog  of\r\n\r\nGovernment expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the expenditure of Government has\r\n\r\nincreased  over the years - Members of the  Opposition\r\n\r\nhave  drawn attention to it - so has the need for  the\r\n\r\nAudit Department to expand. Again, the activities of\r\n\r\nGovernment departments have also increased: so  have\r\n\r\nthe  activities  of  the City Council,  the  Harbour\r\n\r\nBoard,  and  the Singapore Improvement Trust  (whose\r\n\r\nbooks  are also audited by the Department of  Audit)\r\n\r\nincreased;  and in future, of course, we  will  have\r\n\r\nthe  task  of  auditing  the books  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the increase in Government expenditure alone\r\n\r\nover  the past five years, hon.

During  that period  the  books  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  departments  have  increased  in  size  and\r\n\r\nnumber.

The\r\n\r\namount  of  supervision which  must  necessarily  be\r\n\r\ngiven by qualified and experienced officers has been\r\n\r\nlacking.

The Chief Minister on that occasion,  in\r\n\r\nan outburst of humility in considering what is right and\r\n\r\nproper for the Ministers and the Chief Minister of  this\r\n\r\nterritory,  strenuously put forward  his  new  Socialist\r\n\r\npoint  of  view that Ministers should live a  life  less\r\n\r\nexalted than their previous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncolonial administrators who had, in his opinion, set\r\n\r\na completely false standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I make any comment on the sum of\r\n\r\n$10,000,  I  want  to  make it clear  to  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister that we do not, in the least, question  his\r\n\r\nintegrity on how the $10,000 will be spent. What  we\r\n\r\ndo  question is this hypocrisy in saying \"We do  not\r\n\r\nwant to take $5,000. We will only take $3,500 - \"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, order. The word \"hypocrisy\"\r\n\r\nhas been ruled out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I apologise\r\n\r\nfor the use of that word, but that word stares us in\r\n\r\nthe face so often in the 200 odd pages of the Budget\r\n\r\nEstimates.  I  intend  to  indicate  to  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister that it is much more reasonable to say,  \"I\r\n\r\nam  drawing  a  salary of $5,000 a month  and  I  am\r\n\r\nliving up to that standard.\" To break it up -  and  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  blame  the Chief Minister and  his  elected\r\n\r\nMinisters   for  this - is  to  follow  the   colonial\r\n\r\ntradition. They have been accustomed to come  before\r\n\r\nthis  House  and, on being asked, \"How much  is  the\r\n\r\nChief Secretary being paid?\", would reply, \"Turn  it\r\n\r\nup and see what it is.\" To find out whether it is  a\r\n\r\nreasonable  and modest sum for a man in his  exalted\r\n\r\nposition of life, one has to turn up and find  these\r\n\r\nitems  spread  over  many pages - \"Expatriation  pay\";\r\n\r\n\"upkeep  of  house\"; \"upkeep of garden\";  \"transport\r\n\r\nexpenses\"; etc. And our elected Ministers are  being\r\n\r\nmade, perhaps unwillingly, perhaps unconsciously, to\r\n\r\nfit into the scheme of things. Already they are down\r\n\r\nfor  a  very  modest $150 as transport expenses  and\r\n\r\ndown  for  entertainment expenses  of  one  sort  or\r\n\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Prime Minister of Great Britain had\r\n\r\ndifficulty over his own personal emolument, he  went\r\n\r\nbefore the House and put matters fairly and squarely\r\n\r\nbefore  it. There was a debate on it; the thing  was\r\n\r\nproperly  thrashed out - how the Prime Minister  of  a\r\n\r\nlarge Empire conducts himself - rebates were made  and\r\n\r\nconcessions given. We have now a matter that  should\r\n\r\nhave been raised at the time when the Ministers came\r\n\r\nforward  before this House for their salaries.  They\r\n\r\nshould not, after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  got  their salary, decide  that  it  is  not\r\n\r\nenough  after  all, and then sneak in  entertainment\r\n\r\nexpenses  ranging from $10,000 to $2,000; and  sneak\r\n\r\nin  transport  expenses. Sir, the next Budget  might\r\n\r\nwell show that some further unforeseen stresses  and\r\n\r\nstrains  on the modest emoluments of Ministers  have\r\n\r\nmade themselves felt, and further additions may well\r\n\r\nbe  attempted in this manner. Our criticism is  that\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister did not come forward frankly and\r\n\r\nfairly  and  say  that  he, as  Chief  Minister,  is\r\n\r\ngetting a sum of $3,500 a month, $500 as a Member of\r\n\r\nthe   Assembly,  tax  free,  $10,000  a   year   for\r\n\r\nentertainment expenses, $150 for his transport,  and\r\n\r\nso on. He should not come to the House for a vote to\r\n\r\nincrease,  piecemeal, the number of  perquisites  of\r\n\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to support this amendment, although it  has\r\n\r\nalso been put in by me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add just one or two points to what\r\n\r\nhas  been  said. We do not say that Chief  Ministers\r\n\r\nmust not entertain. We do understand that there must\r\n\r\nbe  a certain amount of entertainment, but we must\r\n\r\nalways remember that whenever a Budget is presented,\r\n\r\nespecially this Budget when you say that the deficit\r\n\r\nis  real, then there must be some economy.  Now,  if\r\n\r\nthere  are  going to be economies, we will  have  to\r\n\r\nrefer  back to previous years to find out  how  such\r\n\r\nexpenditures came in. Previously I believe the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary was carrying on all such work - all the work\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministries rolled into one - and we  do  find\r\n\r\nthat  expenditure in that direction was not as  much\r\n\r\nas  it  is  estimated today. Now that it  is  spread\r\n\r\namong  many Ministries, I think the expenditure  for\r\n\r\neach Minister should not be much more than what  was\r\n\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that catches our attention is that\r\n\r\nin  the  past  few  months we have witnessed  a  few\r\n\r\nfunctions  which  cost Government  to  the  tune  of\r\n\r\n$4,000  in  one  case.  Now, if  functions  of  this\r\n\r\nnature,  thrown open, shall we say, to Mr. and  Mrs.\r\n\r\nSingapore, should be conducted\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  such a large scale, we could ask, \"Where will  it\r\n\r\nstop?\"  Inviting 50 people per elected representative\r\n\r\nwas  the  number asked for by the Chief Minister.  He\r\n\r\ncould  easily  have  asked for even  more,  and  then\r\n\r\nexpenditure would probably rise further.  I  consider\r\n\r\nit  lavish  from all points of view and,  because  of\r\n\r\nthat, we do propose a cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr D. S. Marshall):</b> If it\r\n\r\nplease  you, Sir, I am so happy to see an example  so\r\n\r\nblatant  of the intellectual integrity of the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nas  indicated in today's debate. This House, Sir, has\r\n\r\nnot  so short a memory that it forgets that on Monday\r\n\r\nmorning  the  leader  of the  P.A.P.,  the  hon. and\r\n\r\nlearned  Member for Tanjong Pagar, in castigating  me\r\n\r\nfor  a sterile speech, blamed me for taking seriously\r\n\r\nthe  petty objection of petty politicians in  respect\r\n\r\nof  the entertainment allowance. What was \"the  petty\r\n\r\nobjection  of petty politicians\" is the objection  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. today, and that is the position we are at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has, Sir, suggested that this entertainment\r\n\r\nallowance should be part of our salary. That  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  what was suggested officially, and in fairness\r\n\r\nto  the  officials  there was no  question  of  their\r\n\r\nputting it in this fashion. It was the desire of  the\r\n\r\nelected   Ministers  who  wanted  no  part   of   the\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowance as  part  of  their  salary,\r\n\r\nbecause  when you have an entertainment allowance  as\r\n\r\npart of your salary - as is the case, Sir, with respect\r\n\r\nto  the President of the City Council there is always\r\n\r\na  charge that you under-spend and that you profit by\r\n\r\nthat  allowance. I did not think it was fair,  either\r\n\r\nto  us  or to the public, that we should have a fixed\r\n\r\nentertainment allowance as part of our  salary  which\r\n\r\nwe  could  not  be certain of spending  precisely.  I\r\n\r\nthought  it was only fair to this Assembly that  this\r\n\r\nallowance  should  not only be entirely  outside  our\r\n\r\nsalary,  but that this Assembly, through its  Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee, should have the right to examine in detail\r\n\r\nour  expenditure and to challenge it.  The  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary, as the watchdog of our Treasury,  Sir,  on\r\n\r\none  occasion did, I think, challenge the $10  for  a\r\n\r\nbasket of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norchids  which  I  sent  to the  wife  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of Pakistan! He is entitled to do that and I\r\n\r\ndo  not  complain. It may well be beneath my dignity,\r\n\r\nSir, and  it  may  well be beneath  the  dignity  of\r\n\r\nMinisters to submit themselves to this procedure. You\r\n\r\nyourself, Sir, I think, have pointed this out  in  so\r\n\r\nfar  as your Office is concerned, when it came  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion of allocating $4,800 entertainment allowance\r\n\r\nfor  the  Speaker.  But the Chief  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nelected colleagues are in a different position.  They\r\n\r\nare  subject to the malice and the abuse of political\r\n\r\nmanoeuvres   and  they  can  be  and  are  constantly\r\n\r\nmisrepresented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as is possible, Sir, we not only want to be\r\n\r\nhonest, but we want to be patently honest so that our\r\n\r\nconduct  would be under the constant supervision  not\r\n\r\nonly   of  this  Assembly  but  also  of  its  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  There was no question of any sneaking  of\r\n\r\nexpenses. I know, Sir, that there are some people  so\r\n\r\nevil  that  it  is difficult for them to  think  that\r\n\r\nothers  can be honest. There is a proverb which  says\r\n\r\nhoni  soit qui mal y pense. There are some so steeped\r\n\r\nin  deception that they are quite incapable  even  of\r\n\r\nunderstanding honesty. It is natural. It is the  very\r\n\r\nbreath  of  their  lives. But  I  would  remind  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that at each and every one of my  functions,\r\n\r\nthey were invited, most of them, and that in each and\r\n\r\nevery  case this Assembly, prior to this Budget,  has\r\n\r\nbeen asked for its approval. There has never been any\r\n\r\nquestion  of trying to sneak in extra money  for  the\r\n\r\nMinisters. It has been suggested, Sir, that there  is\r\n\r\nhypocrisy  on our part, and humility, false humility,\r\n\r\nin  seeking  a  low  salary. You have  attended  many\r\n\r\nfunctions,  Sir, and with respect to those  who  gave\r\n\r\nthem  and to those functions which I gave, more often\r\n\r\nthan not they are a dreadful bore, and I do not think\r\n\r\nthat any person can really suggest that it is a great\r\n\r\nperquisite  to  be  able  to  give  or  attend  these\r\n\r\nfunctions and that they are to be considered as  part\r\n\r\nof a man's emoluments, particularly when he does not\r\n\r\ntouch the money at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have tried, with all my heart, to bring a\r\n\r\nnew   concept  of  expenditure  into  the  Government\r\n\r\nservice. It is no easy thing to change a tradition of\r\n\r\nmany  decades that is deeply imbued and that is  part\r\n\r\nof  the  very way they live. The idea of  having  the\r\n\r\nmodest salaries we sought was to give an example, but\r\n\r\nhowever  humble we may be in seeking to live our  own\r\n\r\nindividual lives and the charge which we wish to make\r\n\r\nupon  the  public finance for our own  existence,  we\r\n\r\nmust,  when  considering our duties in giving  public\r\n\r\nfunctions, also consider the dignity of Singapore  as\r\n\r\na  country. Our receptions to our foreign guests must\r\n\r\nbe  compatible with the dignity of Singapore  and  in\r\n\r\nthis   connection  the  Member  for  Serangoon,   who\r\n\r\ncomplains  when 4,000 people attended a function  for\r\n\r\nMalcolm  MacDonald  at a cost of  $4,400,  does  not,\r\n\r\nthrough  his own Party in the City Council,  complain\r\n\r\nwhen  $8,700 was spent for the the same occasion  for\r\n\r\nthe same man - more than twice. That is the logic, Sir,\r\n\r\nof  the Progressive Party. Now we know to what depths\r\n\r\npolitical  manoeuvres  and  political  jealousy   can\r\n\r\ndescend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I want to speak on this\r\n\r\nsubject, and I have got many other subjects to  speak\r\n\r\non.  It is rather surprising that so much should have\r\n\r\nbeen  spent by the Chief Minister and other Ministers\r\n\r\non entertainment, transport and what not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have since the post-war period been in the\r\n\r\nB.M.A. Council, the Advisory Council, the Legislative\r\n\r\nCouncil  and  the Legislative Assembly. I  have  seen\r\n\r\nfunctions and functions. They were held by  the  head\r\n\r\nof   this  State  at  that  time - His  Excellency  the\r\n\r\nGovernor.  He  is still doing that  now.  We  do  not\r\n\r\ngrudge  a  reasonable amount to be paid to the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  for his entertainment, but since  the  last\r\n\r\nsix   or  seven  months  we  have  had  nothing   but\r\n\r\nentertainment  parties  and  dinners,  and  at  whose\r\n\r\nexpense?  We, the taxpayers' expense. Why should  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  spend so much money? After all,  what  is\r\n\r\nSingapore?  It  is a small city compared  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries of the world. It is at the crossroads. Many\r\n\r\npeople\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npass through it, foreign guests pass through it,  but\r\n\r\nit  does  not mean that each and every one should  be\r\n\r\nentertained at our cost and at that exorbitant rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I was getting\r\n\r\nalarmed  when  the  Member  for  Telok  Ayer  started\r\n\r\nspeaking  on the subject. One should always  remember\r\n\r\nthat, after all, this is not an attack on the way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  a particular Chief Minister chooses to conduct\r\n\r\nhis  office, but more an attack, in the  case  of  my\r\n\r\nParty, on the form in which this item of $10,000  has\r\n\r\nbeen brought forward. It has never been suggested  by\r\n\r\nus  that $10,000 is too much. It is our view that the\r\n\r\nChief   Minister  of  Singapore  should,   as   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister, live and act like one. After all,  even  in\r\n\r\nthe  most  puritan of Communist countries,  when  the\r\n\r\nForeign  Minister  of the Chinese  People's  Republic\r\n\r\ngoes  to  Geneva and throws a reception, it  is - I  am\r\n\r\ntold  by  those who have attended such a  reception - a\r\n\r\nmost   sumptuous  occasion,  as  befits  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nMinister of a great Republic. And as befits the Chief\r\n\r\nMinister of Singapore, a great island, all man-made - [Interruption.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it depresses me to see the Chief Minister\r\n\r\nfeeling  somewhat  unnerved by the  thought  that  he\r\n\r\nshould,   in  fact,  deport  himself  as  the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister. The point he sought to make is that we said\r\n\r\non Monday that this was a trivial matter, yet we come\r\n\r\ntoday to debate this as a matter of great importance.\r\n\r\nOn  Monday we said it was trivial. Today we say it is\r\n\r\ntrivial. The only question we have raised is the form\r\n\r\nin which it was brought forward. What we do challenge\r\n\r\nis the fact that, whilst on the one hand he had said,\r\n\r\n\"We are going to be modest in our living\" - and we were\r\n\r\nled  to assume that that included both their personal\r\n\r\nand  their  official lives - on the  other  hand,  long\r\n\r\nbefore  Budget Day we were presented with  dribs  and\r\n\r\ndrabs of entertainment expenditure, everyone of  them\r\n\r\nfor   a   special  occasion.  The  Rt.  Hon.  Malcolm\r\n\r\nMacDonald going away - the greatest man that ever lived\r\n\r\nin  Malaya;  Sir John Nicoll going away - the  greatest\r\n\r\nGovernor that ever\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncame  here.

No\r\n\r\ndoubt  more great people will come and go. But, after\r\n\r\nall,  Chief  Ministers  stay  on  forever,  and  they\r\n\r\nshould,  in  my  view, be given every opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrepresent the people in a proper way and to act in  a\r\n\r\nmanner befitting the dignity of that office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> There are one or two points I should like\r\n\r\nto  mention,  Sir. There has always  been  a  central\r\n\r\nentertainment  vote  which is under  my  control  and\r\n\r\nwhich is augmented from time to time as the needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  entertainment  of Government have  demanded  it.\r\n\r\nWhat  has  happened now is that that  vote  has  been\r\n\r\nsplit  up  amongst the Chief Minister and  the  other\r\n\r\nMinisters. It is not personal entertainment votes but\r\n\r\npurely departmental votes for entertainment that have\r\n\r\nbeen  created. The expenditure from these votes  will\r\n\r\nhave to be accounted for in the same way as any other\r\n\r\nvotes  of Government - telephones, telegrams - any  other\r\n\r\nvote  that  you can think of. It will be  subject  to\r\n\r\naudit,  and  it  will  be  subject  to  the  detailed\r\n\r\nexamination,  I  presume,  of  the  Public   Accounts\r\n\r\nDepartment.  I  merely  want  to  make   that   quite\r\n\r\nclear - that  these are not personal  votes,  they  are\r\n\r\nmerely   Government  departmental  votes  which   are\r\n\r\nsubject  to all the control that any vote is  subject\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  very  sorry  indeed  that this  question  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters'  expenses has descended into such  abusive\r\n\r\narguments and I am afraid that the Chief Minister  is\r\n\r\npartially  to  be blamed because he  started  with  a\r\n\r\ntorrent of abuse at the first Monday sitting. He  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accusing  the  Progressive Party  for  all  the\r\n\r\nentertainment  expenditure  incurred  by   the   City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  and  today he asks why we should  challenge\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure of $4,000 when the City  Council  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  sort  of entertainment spent  double  that\r\n\r\namount.  Has  he ever considered that the Progressive\r\n\r\nParty  have only seven Councillors out of a total  of\r\n\r\n27?

P. D. Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr M. P. D. Nair (Seletar):</b> Sir, I am afraid the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have supported the amendment  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to make out a case. The first point  that\r\n\r\ncomes  to my mind is this: some of the speakers  have\r\n\r\nexpressed the view that they would like the amount to\r\n\r\nbe  reduced, whilst other Members have expressed  the\r\n\r\nview  that they do not mind about the amount  put  in\r\n\r\nthe  Estimate, but they differ on the manner in which\r\n\r\nthis  has  appeared in the Budget and the  timing  of\r\n\r\nthis  attempt  to seek the approval of the  Assembly.\r\n\r\nMay  I  say  this, Sir? Although I am  still  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  I feel the Opposition should  contribute\r\n\r\nto a very healthy debate. What we have heard just now\r\n\r\nhas become a very unhealthy debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that an entertainment allowance for anyone\r\n\r\nin  the  Assembly,  whether he is a  Minister  or  an\r\n\r\nAssemblyman,  should  not be  added  to  his  salary,\r\n\r\nbecause  his salary is paid as a result of  the  work\r\n\r\nthat  he does. The entertainment allowance, which  is\r\n\r\nnot  always static, should be quite separate from the\r\n\r\nsalary. On these grounds, therefore, I feel that this\r\n\r\nitem  of  entertainment allowance  appearing  in  the\r\n\r\nEstimates is very fair indeed. This happens not  only\r\n\r\nin Singapore but throughout the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago the Indian National Congress decided\r\n\r\nthat their Ministers should accept only Rupees 500 as\r\n\r\nsalary. Well, had they no entertainment allowance  at\r\n\r\nall?  They had. Did they make an attempt to  add  the\r\n\r\nentertainment allowance to their salary and then say.\r\n\r\n\"We are only receiving so much and,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell,  we  will be able to please the public.\"?  They\r\n\r\nnever did that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel, Sir, that we must respect the honest\r\n\r\nattitude of the Government in a situation like  this.\r\n\r\nThey have come here in an honest way saying that they\r\n\r\ndo  not  like to receive more salary. They  have  now\r\n\r\ncome  here with the suggestion that they should  have\r\n\r\nsome  entertainment allowance. To my  mind,  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nwould  appear to be very fair. I trust the Opposition\r\n\r\nwill not degenerate in this debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, I feel it right that I should take this  point\r\n\r\nof  order  now. My reference to the point  of  order\r\n\r\narises  out of the provisions of Standing  Order  33\r\n\r\n(1)  (b)  which was referred to earlier this morning\r\n\r\nand  which, of course, reproduces substantially  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  Section  60  (3)  of  the  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I should preface the point which I am\r\n\r\nmaking,  Sir,  by enquiring whether the  consent  or\r\n\r\nrecommendation of the Governor has been obtained  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  this  motion.  I  say  \"enquire\",  Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  relates  to an entertainment  allowance\r\n\r\nwhich  is paid to the Chief Secretary. It is not  in\r\n\r\nthe  nature of an expense account and is part of the\r\n\r\nallowances   paid  to  him.  My  point   of   order,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  arises, Sir, out of  the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding Order 33 (1) (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Under Standing\r\n\r\nOrder  33  (1), the Assembly cannot proceed  with  a\r\n\r\nmotion  of  this nature - and in my opinion  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmotion    of   this   nature -  except   with    the\r\n\r\nrecommendation or consent of the Governor  signified\r\n\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, unless the Member for Tiong Bahru has the\r\n\r\nrecommendation or consent of the Governor signified,\r\n\r\nthe motion cannot be proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

On\r\n\r\nHead 10, Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew)  raised the question of  salary  for  the\r\n\r\nAuditors  and this also comes within the  provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order 33 (1) (b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

When we  dealt  with\r\n\r\nHead  10, that was in respect of an amendment  to  a\r\n\r\npost that was proposed to be created. In fact, there\r\n\r\nwas  an increase of one post; in other words,  there\r\n\r\nwas no individual appointed to that post. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  point  really  was that  the  approval  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  should  be obtained for  the  post  to  be\r\n\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this particular case, we have a public officer\r\n\r\nwithin  the  meaning of Standing Order  33  (1)  (b)\r\n\r\nwhose  salary, allowances or conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nare  being attacked. There is a distinction and that\r\n\r\ndistinction must be borne in mind where there is, in\r\n\r\nfact,  a  public  officer who is drawing  a  certain\r\n\r\nsalary, with  certain perquisites attached  to  his\r\n\r\noffice.  I am therefore quite powerless because  the\r\n\r\nStanding  Order  says you cannot  proceed  with  the\r\n\r\nmotion, and so does the Order in Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I would\r\n\r\nadd  further that this is not the one and only  item\r\n\r\nof  its kind in the Estimates, but it repeats itself\r\n\r\nunder  various  heads, in some  instances  the  1956\r\n\r\nallocation showing an increase over that  for  1955.\r\n\r\nSir,  I submit that this item - hotel allowance - should\r\n\r\nbe  going  down  and it is not going  down,  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  like  to  know whether there  are  good  and\r\n\r\nadequate reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> The answer to the question posed by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Tanglin, Mr Chairman, is simple.

They  are,  of  course,  only  paid  until\r\n\r\naccommodation becomes vacant and as more houses  are\r\n\r\navailable, the period that these officers  spend  in\r\n\r\nhotels decreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Can my hon.

May I have an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  there is likely to  be  a  decrease\r\n\r\nwhich  one  would  assume with the increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   houses  being  built  for   Government\r\n\r\nofficers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Higham -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Higham:</b> It was felt prudent to put the\r\n\r\nestimated  amount  required at $300,000.  When  that\r\n\r\nestimate  was prepared, of course, the amount  spent\r\n\r\nthis year was not known.

I think it  is  not\r\n\r\nvery far wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the current year, $1,120,000 has been spent\r\n\r\non   passages  for  expatriate  officers  and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies  under the conditions of service  on  which\r\n\r\nthey  came to this country. $130,000 has been  spent\r\n\r\non  a  new  scheme which was introduced in  1954 - the\r\n\r\nAnnual Leave Scheme - whereby certain senior officers,\r\n\r\nheads  and deputy heads of departments in  the  main\r\n\r\nwere  allowed  to  go  home  annually,  taking   air\r\n\r\npassages  instead of the normal sea  passages.  That\r\n\r\nwas a scheme introduced in Government's interest  in\r\n\r\norder  to keep key men in their posts without having\r\n\r\nthese  very  long leaves - six months and  more - during\r\n\r\nwhich there was a lack of continuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Annual Leave Scheme, an officer does, in\r\n\r\nfact, take less time but he takes it oftener and  he\r\n\r\nflies.  So  he forfeits not only some of the  normal\r\n\r\nleave  that  he would earn under the ordinary  leave\r\n\r\nregulations  which, for an officer over  35,  is,  I\r\n\r\nthink, five days per month for each year served plus\r\n\r\na  voyage  leave either by sea or by air, but  under\r\n\r\nthe Annual Leave Scheme, he gets air passage and,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  six weeks' leave a year. So he loses out  on\r\n\r\nthe  total  amount of leave that he gets,  but  some\r\n\r\nofficers  prefer  to  take it that  way  and  it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  very much in the interests of  Government\r\n\r\nif  officers  do take it that way, although  it  may\r\n\r\nbecome more expensive in that air passages are  more\r\n\r\nexpensive   if  they  are  taken  oftener.

If  my memory serves  me  correctly,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, Sir, the Master Plan, which was to  be  the\r\n\r\nachievement  of  this Team, was completed  nearly  a\r\n\r\nyear  ago  and is due to be published some  time  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  next year. I seek information whether  this\r\n\r\nTeam  is  to  be kept on. It seems to me that  their\r\n\r\nwork  is completed and I would like to know why they\r\n\r\nshould be kept if it is necessary to do so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> What is known, Sir, as a Diagnostic\r\n\r\nSurvey  Team  was  brought out to Singapore  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, I think, early in 1952 to take\r\n\r\ncharge  of  the task of drawing up the Master  Plan.\r\n\r\nThe  conditions  under which they  were  brought  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  were that Government would be responsible\r\n\r\nfor their pay, passages and leave salaries, and they\r\n\r\nworked on that basis until the end of 1954. By  that\r\n\r\ntime,  the Master Plan was largely completed.  There\r\n\r\nwere certain other details\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich  had to be completed at a later date  but  the\r\n\r\nwork  had  largely been done. By that time, however,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Improvement Trust had come to realise\r\n\r\nthat   they  would  require  the  services  of   the\r\n\r\nDiagnostic Survey Team for an indefinite period.  It\r\n\r\nwas   therefore  decided  that  their  salaries  and\r\n\r\npassages would then become the responsibility of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust with effect from the 1st\r\n\r\nof  January, 1955. There was, however, a  continuing\r\n\r\nliability  on  Government to pay the leave  pay  and\r\n\r\npassages  of the officers on the Team carried  prior\r\n\r\nto  the  end of 1954, and the bulk of this provision\r\n\r\nin the Estimates now is for an outstanding liability\r\n\r\nup to the end of 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are one or two other matters outstanding - the\r\n\r\nquestion  of the cost of publication of  the  Master\r\n\r\nPlan  and the cost of holding inquiries into matters\r\n\r\narising  out of the Master Plan. How these  expenses\r\n\r\nwill  be  apportioned, I cannot yet say. The  latest\r\n\r\nsuggestion  is  that Government will be  responsible\r\n\r\nfor the cost of publishing the Master Plan. That has\r\n\r\nbeen  included in the Estimates. It may  however  be\r\n\r\nnecessary, as a result of further proposals, for the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust to bear the cost of  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan, and for Government to bear the cost  of\r\n\r\npublication  and the cost of holding inquiries  into\r\n\r\nthe Master Plan. The provision in the Estimates this\r\n\r\nyear is for the arrears of leave pay and passages of\r\n\r\nthe  officers on the Team up to the end of 1954  and\r\n\r\nfor the cost of publishing the Plan this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the information and I beg  leave  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

If   we  are   to   sell   Singapore\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  to the outside world, the  Government,\r\n\r\nand the City Council for that matter, should not  be\r\n\r\nniggardly  in  its  contribution  to  this   tourist\r\n\r\npromotion.

On that basis,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to move the amendment that it  should\r\n\r\nnot be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  support the motion moved by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nAyer.  When this Assembly met last Monday,  we  were\r\n\r\ntold  by  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary  that\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowances to elected  Ministers  are\r\n\r\nabsolutely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  order that they could maintain  their\r\n\r\npublic  relations with those who visit this  country\r\n\r\nand public or business enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really amazed to find that as an official\r\n\r\nMember  of  the  Government, the Hon. the  Financial\r\n\r\nSecretary  himself voted the sum of $5,000  for  his\r\n\r\nown   Ministry  because  he  prepared  that   Budget\r\n\r\nhimself. This vote of $5,000 is public money and  is\r\n\r\nrather  a  contrast  to the speeches  he  made  last\r\n\r\nMonday.  He was then in favour of elected  Ministers\r\n\r\nhaving  entertainment allowances. But why should  an\r\n\r\nofficial Member of the Government be allowed to vote\r\n\r\nthe  same sum of money for public entertainment?  It\r\n\r\nis  rather  a  contrast. At the same  time,  let  us\r\n\r\ncompare his figure of $5,000 with that of an elected\r\n\r\nMinister  of only $2,000. Why is it that an  elected\r\n\r\nMinister  is  only allowed $2,000  and  an  official\r\n\r\nMember $5,000? This is rather absurd. We are here to\r\n\r\nguard  public  funds  and if  we  do  not  guard  it\r\n\r\nproperly, I am afraid we will be accused of  showing\r\n\r\na  lack of responsibility. I am strongly opposed  to\r\n\r\nthis $5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I bend under this virulent attack, Sir!\r\n\r\nAs  I have explained earlier today, there has always\r\n\r\nbeen  a  central Secretariat vote for entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been  $10,000; it has been supplemented  as\r\n\r\noccasion required. When the present Government  came\r\n\r\ninto  power, it was decided, as a temporary measure,\r\n\r\nthat  Ministers who had to entertain would  continue\r\n\r\nto  draw  upon this vote. This arrangement  has  not\r\n\r\nworked  very  satisfactorily. Having considered  the\r\n\r\nmatter  purely from the point of view of a  Treasury\r\n\r\nofficial,  I thought that the best means of  dealing\r\n\r\nwith  this  problem in the future would be  to  give\r\n\r\nMinisters votes in their own Departments which  they\r\n\r\ncould  control  themselves  and,  in  the  end,   be\r\n\r\nanswerable to the Audit and to the Assembly for  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  arising from them. At  the  same  time,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I  realised that it would be necessary  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the remnants of the central vote under  the\r\n\r\nTreasury control so that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndemands of other departments for entertainment could\r\n\r\nbe  met.  For example, as has happened in the  past,\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of entertaining visiting naval personnel,\r\n\r\nschool  children on certain occasions, and provision\r\n\r\nfor other matters of a similar nature. These demands\r\n\r\non  the  public purse do arise throughout  the  year\r\n\r\nand, for that reason, I maintain under my control in\r\n\r\nthe  Treasury  this small vote of  $5,000.  I  would\r\n\r\nassure my friend the Member for Telok Ayer and  also\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown that it is not a personal\r\n\r\nvote.  It is purely a central Secretariat vote which\r\n\r\nis under my control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, I fully appreciate that\r\n\r\nthe  money  is  there and will  only  be  used  when\r\n\r\nnecessary,  but  the provision is  there  and  if  a\r\n\r\nprovision is made, any Minister could just make  use\r\n\r\nof that money because it has been allotted and voted\r\n\r\nfor. If the Hon. the Financial Secretary is going  to\r\n\r\nreserve  this vote for other Ministries, I  am  very\r\n\r\nhappy about it and I hope that he will make it clear\r\n\r\nin  future  cases that it is a reserved  vote  or  a\r\n\r\nreserved  fund for other Ministries which  may  find\r\n\r\ntheir votes inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I hope that my personal integrity is not\r\n\r\nbeing impugned by the Member for Queenstown.

I cannot make\r\n\r\nthe  position  clearer and I  hope  the  Member  now\r\n\r\nunderstands.

If there were five  Scale  A\r\n\r\nAccountants last year, how could it be said that  an\r\n\r\nincrease to 6 Scale A Accountants is an increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof two? I do not see any extra one being approved in\r\n\r\nthe  1955  Estimates. What I do see,  Mr  Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, in the Singapore Establishment List at page 74,\r\n\r\nis  four  Accountants  approved  in  1954 - \"Timescale\r\n\r\nappointments,  Accountants, Scale  A  (Qualified)\" - four  expatriates listed. But it has in the head note\r\n\r\n\"5  appointments\". As I see the 1955 Estimates,  the\r\n\r\napproval  was  for  four Scale  A  Accountants.  The\r\n\r\nappointments  are  five. But the  actual  number  of\r\n\r\nnames   listed   under  that  particular   Scale   A\r\n\r\nappointment is four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then one gets \"Timescale appointments,\r\n\r\nAccountants, Scale B\" one appointment, but two names\r\n\r\nunder it. Now, that is an irregularity which may  be\r\n\r\npurely typographical, or could be explained away one\r\n\r\nway  or another. But what cannot be explained  away.\r\n\r\nMr   Chairman,  Sir,  is  this:  there   are   four\r\n\r\nAccountants  now  on  Scale A - all  are  expatriates.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two  Accountants  now  on  Scale  B - both\r\n\r\nexpatriates.  The  difference between  Scale  A  and\r\n\r\nScale  B  is that Scale A is for qualified  men  and\r\n\r\nScale  B  is for underqualified men. There  are  no\r\n\r\nlocal  men in Scale B who could possibly be promoted\r\n\r\nto  Scale A. If this vote is to increase the  number\r\n\r\nof  Scale A appointments from four to six, then  the\r\n\r\nonly  reasonable inference one can draw from  it  is\r\n\r\nthat  the  two underqualified Scale B men would  be\r\n\r\nboosted  up  into  Scale A appointments  which  were\r\n\r\nmeant  for qualified men. I would like to  hear  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary on that point before  I\r\n\r\nmake any further remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> May I borrow your 1955 Establishment\r\n\r\nList?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I should be delighted to let you\r\n\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, in the 1955 Estimates on page 200,\r\n\r\nthere were, in fact, four Accountants, Scale A,  and\r\n\r\none Accountant, Scale B. Hitherto, there had been  2\r\n\r\nAccountants, Scale B, but one post was struck off in\r\n\r\nframing the 1955 Estimates. Does that make the point\r\n\r\nclear?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I should explain what is the difference\r\n\r\nbetween  Scale A and Scale B.  Scale A is for  fully\r\n\r\nqualified  Accountants.  Until  very  recently,   it\r\n\r\ncovered  the three main qualifications - the Scottish\r\n\r\nChartered    Accountant,   the   English   Chartered\r\n\r\nAccountant   and   the   Society   of   Incorporated\r\n\r\nAccountants.  Very  recently, the qualification  has\r\n\r\nbeen  widened and extended to bring in the Certified\r\n\r\nAccountant,  the man who could obtain qualifications\r\n\r\nin Singapore, I think, by correspondence. So Scale A\r\n\r\nis  now  for  qualified Accountants embracing  these\r\n\r\nfour main categories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scale B is for the underqualified Accountant.\r\n\r\nUntil  very  recently we did have two  officers  who\r\n\r\nwere  underqualified Accountants but they have  now\r\n\r\nbeen    transferred   from   the    Department    to\r\n\r\nAdministrative appointments. We have now, therefore,\r\n\r\nno underqualified Accountants in the Department but\r\n\r\nwe  do  require qualified Accountants and, from  now\r\n\r\non,  the  only  people  taken into  the  Accountant-General's  Department in Division I  will  be  fully\r\n\r\nqualified Accountants - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Expatriate or local?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

All we want are properly\r\n\r\nqualified  officers.  What  has  happened   to   the\r\n\r\nEstimates  this year is that there is no longer  any\r\n\r\nunderqualified  Accountant in  the  Department.

We  consider  it\r\n\r\nill   advised   to   allocate  generous   travelling\r\n\r\nallowances to Ministers and their staff when so many\r\n\r\nmore  important items of expenditure have had to  be\r\n\r\nerased  through lack of funds. I must confess myself\r\n\r\nto  be  a  little puzzled because of  the  disparity\r\n\r\nbetween   the  travelling  allowances  in  different\r\n\r\ndepartments.   For  example,  in  the   Income   Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment,  which has a staff of over 250  persons,\r\n\r\nthere  is a travelling allowance of $1,300;  in  the\r\n\r\nStatistics  Department, for a staff of  over  80,  a\r\n\r\ntravelling  allowance  of  $1,500;  while   in   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Commerce and Industry, with a staff  of\r\n\r\n43, there is this allowance of $5,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr D.

The expenditure for  this  year,  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  this item, $6,830, arises from  various\r\n\r\nsub-heads: air and rail fares; travel to Bangkok  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of the Rice Advisory Committee;  travel  to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  in respect of consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Economic Affairs; and all these come out\r\n\r\nof this vote. There is no question of the Minister's\r\n\r\ntransport being involved there. It is a common  pool\r\n\r\nfor  transport on official business by  officers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry. It also includes, Sir, the  officers'\r\n\r\nmonthly  mileage.  As  you  are  aware,  Sir,  their\r\n\r\nemoluments include pay in respect of monthly mileage\r\n\r\non  behalf  of the department, and it also  includes\r\n\r\nbus fares and various items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, in answer to our request for economy,\r\n\r\nthe   sum   allocated  this  year  was  $6,830.   My\r\n\r\ndepartment responded with this reduction  of  $1,830\r\n\r\nwhich,  to my mind, was a good reduction and  to  me\r\n\r\nwas  acceptable. But I would like to assure the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  that it is not the question of an allocation\r\n\r\nbeing  made  and therefore has to be spent.  In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the entertainment allowance which was  made\r\n\r\nin  respect  of  this year in connection  with  this\r\n\r\nMinistry,   far   less   was   spent   because   the\r\n\r\nentertainment  allowance mostly came  out  from  the\r\n\r\nChief Minister's vote, but\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  position  as regards  the  travelling\r\n\r\nallowances.

That  vote was converted last  year  into  a\r\n\r\ndepartmental entertainment vote, and  it  has  been\r\n\r\nreduced  in 1956 by a further $400 a year to  bring\r\n\r\nit  into line with the other Ministry votes.

In other words, Sir, it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  necessarily mean that  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLocal  Government,  Lands  and  Housing  should  not\r\n\r\nentertain  simply  because  he  happens  to  be  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Local Government, Lands and Housing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I should also explain that the sum of\r\n\r\n$2,000  is  vested in the Treasury. I  am  not  paid\r\n\r\nmonthly  at so much and so much. There is  therefore\r\n\r\nno point at all in putting in this amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I would like just to ask\r\n\r\nthis.  Some of the Members on the Government Benches\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  Hon. the Financial  Secretary  goes\r\n\r\nthrough everything which is submitted to him and  it\r\n\r\nis  up to him whether to pass it or not to pass  it.\r\n\r\nNow,  my  enquiry is this, Sir. If the  six  elected\r\n\r\nMinisters  and the official Ministers  decide  among\r\n\r\nthemselves to demand a certain amount of money, will\r\n\r\nthe Hon. the Financial Secretary - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is hardly a point of order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> I will say, if the elected and\r\n\r\nofficial  Ministers ask or request, can the Hon. the\r\n\r\nFinancial Secretary say no to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> It seems to me, Sir, that I am going over\r\n\r\nthe  same  course many times. I did try  to  explain\r\n\r\nearlier that hitherto we have had a central vote and\r\n\r\nit  was agreed, when the Government came into power,\r\n\r\nthat,  as a temporary measure and until we  saw  how\r\n\r\nthings worked, Ministers who had to entertain  would\r\n\r\ncall  upon  the central vote; but after I  had  seen\r\n\r\nthat  working  for  some  months,  I  came  to   the\r\n\r\nconclusion that it was inappropriate that Ministers\r\n\r\nshould  have  to seek authority from  me  for  their\r\n\r\nentertainment. They should be answerable not to  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Secretary who, after  all,  is  merely  a\r\n\r\ncolleague,  but to the Legislature. So  I  therefore\r\n\r\ndecided - it is my decision and not the Ministers;  no\r\n\r\nMinister  asked me, I made the decision off  my  own\r\n\r\nbat - that it would be much better if, in the  future,\r\n\r\neach  Minister had an entertainment vote of his  own\r\n\r\nwhich  he  could spend as he thought  desirable  and\r\n\r\nnecessary  in  the  interest of Government,  and  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of which expenditure he would be answerable\r\n\r\nto   the   Assembly  through  the  Public   Accounts\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, therefore, I, of my own\r\n\r\nvolition  and  not at the request of  any  Minister,\r\n\r\nentered  in  the  Estimates $10,000  for  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and $2,000 for each Minister.  As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  many  times,  the  Ministers  will  have  full\r\n\r\nresponsibility   for   these   votes.    They    are\r\n\r\ndepartmental  votes under their  Ministry  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  be accountable for the expenditure which  they\r\n\r\nauthorise  out of it. I fixed the sum of  $2,000  in\r\n\r\neach  case  because  I  thought  that  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nfigure, having regard to the possible charges  which\r\n\r\nthey  might have to meet and having regard  also  to\r\n\r\nthe  inadvisability  of  coming  frequently  to  the\r\n\r\nAssembly for small votes to supplement a very  minor\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would not grudge\r\n\r\nthis amount.
