For example, the fish on the 6-cent stamp is known as  Sumpit\r\n\r\nand Blibiran in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The same Malay name may sometimes be applied to different fishes.

It is generally understood that these balances remain a liability of  the\r\n\r\nbank until they are paid. In practice, the balances are transferred by the banks\r\n\r\nto an \"Unclaimed Balances Account\" and would appear together with other balances\r\n\r\nas liabilities on the bank's balance sheet.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States the Federal Reserve Act and the National Bank Act make no\r\n\r\nprovisions with regard to disposal of unclaimed bank balances.

A  Bill  entitled the Dormant  Bank  Balances  and  Unclaimed\r\n\r\nSecurities  Bill  was referred by the British Parliament to a  Select  Committee\r\n\r\nwhich  after considering it reported in December 1919 that a much longer  period\r\n\r\nthan  six  years  should  elapse  before  a  state  of  dormancy,  having  legal\r\n\r\nconsequences involving publicity, should be recognised. The majority opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee was that an account should he deemed to be  dormant  only\r\n\r\nafter  it  had not been operative for thirty years or more. The Select Committee\r\n\r\nalso suggested that boxes and parcels entrusted to banks for safe keeping should\r\n\r\nbe  subject  to legislative action for their disposal only after  70  years  had\r\n\r\nelapsed.  As  a  result  of the recommendations of this  Select  Committee,  the\r\n\r\nBritish Parliament took no action on the Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In India the practice is to require every banking company to submit within\r\n\r\nthirty days after the close of each calendar year a return of accounts which had\r\n\r\nnot been operated upon for ten years or more. The return should give particulars\r\n\r\nof the deposits standing to the credit of each account but there would appear to\r\n\r\nbe no provision for the disposal of any unclaimed assets.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia, however, there is specific legislation under the Banking Act of\r\n\r\n1957 to provide for the disposal of \"unclaimed monies\" which are defined as  all\r\n\r\nprincipals,  interests, dividends, bonuses, profits and sums  of  money  legally\r\n\r\npayable  by  a  bank in respect of which the time for recovery had  expired  and\r\n\r\nincludes  money to the credit of an account which has not been operative  either\r\n\r\nby  deposit  or  withdrawal  for a period of not  less  than  seven  years.

But  there\r\n\r\nis  one factor which should be taken into account, and it is this. Over the last\r\n\r\neight  or  ten  years,  there has been a decrease in the total  deposit  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Post Office Savings Bank due to the fact that most new savers  prefer\r\n\r\nto  bank  their  savings in the commercial banks which have shown  a  phenomenal\r\n\r\nincrease in recent years. The result was\r\n\r\nthat  the Post Office Savings Bank had to liquidate some of its  long-term assets\r\n\r\nas and when they matured. This being\r\n\r\nso,  it  is better to keep a fair amount of securities in  the\r\n\r\nLondon money\r\n\r\nmarket  where  large sums of money can be realised at very short  notice.\r\n\r\nIf these\r\n\r\nsums are not available and if a large\r\n\r\npart of the securities are held in\r\n\r\nSingapore, it will not be easy for the\r\n\r\nPost Office to sell them at short notice\r\n\r\nwithout loss of capital. As I said, the\r\n\r\nincreases or decreases as entered in the\r\n\r\nbalance sheet of the Post Office Savings\r\n\r\nBank are really book values. They do not reflect the actual purchases or sales.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I want to ask the Minister just one more question.

Indeed, that is the reason  why  we  in  1960\r\n\r\npassed  through this Assembly, a Bill to amend certain provisions  of  the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice Savings Bank Ordinance which allows the whole of the deposits in the Post\r\n\r\nOffice  Savings  Bank  to  be  invested in  Singapore;  formerly,  there  was  a\r\n\r\nlimitation of 40 per cent. But considerations of liquidity, for reasons which  I\r\n\r\nwill  explain, for the time being, although there may be a need to increase more\r\n\r\ninvestments  or more securities in Singapore, I do not think that we  should  go\r\n\r\nthe  whole  hog,  unless  and  until a proper money  market  is  established  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  which  can  meet  large claims for liquidation  of  assets.  In  this\r\n\r\ninstance, for instance, even the Federation of Malaya, which has similar laws to\r\n\r\nours, is keeping about half of its Post Office Savings Bank assets in London.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>JURONG INDUSTRIAL SITES</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether any private\r\n\r\nindustrial  organisation  has  leased  or  purchased  any  part  of  the  Jurong\r\n\r\nindustrial sites developed at public expense.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The answer is no.

A group of 28 tenants  out  of\r\n\r\nsome  2,840 tenants in this Estate made representations that they be allowed  to\r\n\r\npay  the old rents of $25, $35 and $45 to $55 for one, two and three-room  units\r\n\r\nrespectively at Kallang Estate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These old rentals were fixed by the previous Government and resulted in the\r\n\r\nHousing  and  Development  Board having to meet a loss  of  approximately  $1.5\r\n\r\nmillion  annually in respect of less than 3,000 units in the Kallang Estate.  It\r\n\r\nwould  seem that these rentals were fixed with undue haste in 1958, with an  eye\r\n\r\nto  the  general elections. The Housing and Development Board, as  a  nonprofit\r\n\r\nmaking statutory undertaking charged with the responsibility for the provision\r\n\r\nof  public  housing accommodation in the State, will have to depend on  the  Government  to meet the deficit, and steps to rationalise rents have been taken  in\r\n\r\nthe public interest in order to reduce progressively the subsidy which has to be\r\n\r\nmet from public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new rents of $40, $60, and $75 for one, two and three-room units are\r\n\r\npayable  only by new tenants who moved in fully aware of what they were required\r\n\r\nto  pay.  It  should  be pointed out that even these rents are  well  below  the\r\n\r\neconomic rents payable if the Housing and Development Board were to let them out\r\n\r\nwithout  suffering  too  much of a deficit. I would  stress  that  the  existing\r\n\r\ntenants  who moved into the Estate before 16th March, 1961, are continuing  to\r\n\r\npay the former rentals of $25, $35 and $45-$55 per month for one, two and three-room  units, and these tenants number some 2,620.

No one will dispute the need for the\r\n\r\nregulation  of  professional  conduct and standards  of  important  professional\r\n\r\ngroups.  This Bill seeks to do this. At the same time, I must sound  a  word  of\r\n\r\nwarning  against  the dangers of regulation in these matters. It  often  happens\r\n\r\nthat professional associations, under the pretext of maintaining high standards,\r\n\r\nintroduce unduly restrictive measures which have the effect of creating a  tight\r\n\r\nclosed  shop.  This has undesirable effects in two ways. First, an  artificially\r\n\r\ncreated scarcity value for their services compels society to pay high rates  for\r\n\r\nthem.  Second, talented people are denied adequate opportunities of  entry  into\r\n\r\nthe  profession and are hence restricted in the choice of careers open to  them.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree that we do not want this to develop in  the  profession  of\r\n\r\naccountancy as a result of regulation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is the first time that a Bill on the control of the accountancy profession\r\n\r\nis being introduced and there are provisions of an important nature,  I\r\n\r\npropose  that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee after the  Second  Reading.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and five\r\n\r\nMembers to be nominated by the Committee of Selection.-[Dr Goh Keng Swee].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RECLAMATION</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Upper East Coast Road)</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>3.42 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Motion standing in the name of the Prime Minister, which reads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of the Foreshores Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  246)  approves the reclamation by Government of that  portion  of  the\r\n\r\nforeshore  and sea-bed containing an area of approximately 48 acres along  Upper\r\n\r\nEast  Coast Road from the junction of Bedok Road as delineated on the plan which\r\n\r\nis deposited at the Land Office, Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> later entered the Chamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I will first speak to the principle, Mr Chairman. It is a recognised principle\r\n\r\nin  many  democratic countries that where there are matters of gravity affecting\r\n\r\nthe people, if the opportunity is available, their vote should be taken directly\r\n\r\nin  ascertainment  of their wishes rather than through the  indirect  method  of\r\n\r\nrepresentative government. The referendum is, in fact, as one delegation put it,\r\n\r\nan  auxiliary  to  amend the defect in the indirect democracy  of  parliamentary\r\n\r\nrule, and it is not only valid where the Government may have lost the confidence\r\n\r\nof  the country but also where the Government may propose an issue which a  vast\r\n\r\nnumber  of  the citizens do not like. The value of the referendum, Sir,  in  its\r\n\r\ndirect democracy is that no one can then deny that the wishes of the people have\r\n\r\nbeen expressed and that the majority will is known and those who accept the demo\r\n\r\ncratic process must loyally abide by the majority will, thereby helping to  heal\r\n\r\nthe breach between persons honestly holding different views on major issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, in Switzerland where perhaps the issue of referendum has been best perfected, we have it that the matter must be discussed in the Assembly and the question put whether they want the constitutional change proposed and to answer yes or no. In Australia, there is a constitutional requirement that in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  any proposed constitutional change when Parliament has passed  that\r\n\r\nprovision, it must be submitted to the people, and it can only be effective  law\r\n\r\nwhen it has been approved by a majority. Again you see, Sir, a Parliament coming\r\n\r\ninto the formulation of a question. In Canada and New Zealand, Sir, there are ad\r\n\r\nhoc  laws to deal with individual aspects which are referred to a referendum and\r\n\r\nno  general  provisions and in each case the issue and the question are  decided\r\n\r\nand  framed by the Parliament concerned. We have had an interesting recent  case\r\n\r\nof Jamaica, where in the Jamaica Referendum Act of 1960, the question\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwas  framed by the Jamaican Assembly for the purposes of balloting on the  basis\r\n\r\nof a reply of yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not unaware that this issue has been resisted with considerable heat\r\n\r\nand  tortuous  argumentation by the Government. But there  are  certain  aspects\r\n\r\nwhich  make  interesting reading, and I would refer you, Sir,  to  the  Official\r\n\r\nReport No. 3, col. 83.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Before the Member does that, do I understand him now to\r\n\r\nindicate  that his amendment, which is to leave out \"considers\" in line  17  and\r\n\r\nthere  to  insert \"is advised by the Minister at the request of the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly\", has some connection with his amendment to clause 13. In page A3, line\r\n\r\n41, to  leave  out  \"questions\"  and insert \"one  question  as  framed  by  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly\". I do not know whether that is so because, on the face  of\r\n\r\nit, that is not so.

I still cannot\r\n\r\nfollow  the  Member for Anson. He has indicated that he would  prefer  that  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  his  amendment to clause 5 be separated from the debate  which  will\r\n\r\narise from the amendment to clause 13. Clause 13 indicates that there should  be\r\n\r\none  question to be framed by the Legislative Assembly, whereas in clause 5, all\r\n\r\nthat the Member wishes is that, using the words, \"the Yang di-Pertuan Negara can\r\n\r\nonly direct by order that any matter be submitted to -the electors on the advice\r\n\r\nof  the Minister after receiving the request of the Legislative Assembly\".  That\r\n\r\nis a matter and not a question. There may be several questions.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so, Sir. What is pinpointed in clause 13 is the\r\n\r\nquestion  whether  it is to be one or more questions. In clause  5,  it  is  the\r\n\r\nmatter  that  is  being  referred to His Excellency the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Government for a referendum, and consequently the  formulation  of\r\n\r\nthat  matter is within the ambit of the Assembly. I am seeking to show that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment themselves admit that the formulation should be within the  ambit  of\r\n\r\nthe Assembly, and that, in fact, whatever intent they may\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave,  of which we have now had so much notice, they are in a position  to  push\r\n\r\nthrough  and  impose their will by virtue of their number.  The  value  of  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion,  Mr Chairman, that the formulation should be in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  is  that at least there is an opportunity to awaken  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to the facts inherent in the proposed formulation, and also  from  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional aspects that the Opposition should have its share in  attempting\r\n\r\nto  assist the Government, however deaf the Government may be to reason. I  urge\r\n\r\nthat  whether such a vast sum of money as $400,000 is to be spent in itself  is\r\n\r\nimmaterial,  and  not  the main issue. Where the issue is to  be  one  affecting\r\n\r\ngravely the future of the people, no referendum should be held unless requested\r\n\r\nby the Legislative Assembly in the terms indicated by this Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must regulate this debate. I have asked the\r\n\r\nMember  whether he wishes to include his amendment to clause 13  in  this  parti\r\n\r\ncular  debate.  He has said no. As far as I can make out, we are  now  concerned\r\n\r\nwhether or not it is the Legislative Assembly which should request the Minister\r\n\r\nto  invite  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara by order to direct that any  matter  be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  the electorate. The matter, to my mind, would be a broad  subject\r\n\r\nmatter,  like,  for  instance, merger, or, as we have indicated  in  the  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, the issue appertaining to toddy shops. But when we come to the actual\r\n\r\nquestion  or questions, then the debate, of course, will take the line taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson, that is that he desires that there should be one question\r\n\r\nand  that  question should be framed by the Legislative Assembly.  Therefore,  I\r\n\r\nwould  suggest that we confine ourselves to whether or not it would be the  wish\r\n\r\nof  the  Assembly that this order directing that any matter be submitted to  the\r\n\r\nelectors should be left to the Government advising the Yang diPertuan Negara, or\r\n\r\nto the Government after a request being made by the Legislative Assembly. I hope\r\n\r\nI have made the issues very clear on this particular amendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendment of the Member for  Anson.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is not the issue so much as the question, because in a referendum  it\r\n\r\nis the answer to the question that will decide the fate of the nation for genera\r\n\r\ntions to come.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already in the Select Committee gone to great details as regards the\r\n\r\nargument  why  we  should have the whole affair debated in the Assembly.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause,  as  I  pointed out, Sir, as the Bill now stands, the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara in actual fact means the Government, and that is the P.A.P. In fact  that\r\n\r\nis the Central Executive Committee of the P.A.P., as admitted by the Ministers\r\n\r\nin the Select Committee. Therefore, under those circumstances, it becomes a one-party affair. I do not want to elaborate on that, Sir, but surely we know that \r\n\r\nthe  referendum  is a national affair and in any matter that concerns  the  whole\r\n\r\nnation proper airing and ventilation is abso1utely necessary so that all  the-e\r\n\r\npeople  must  know  all  the pros and cons, the good and  the  bad,  the  hidden\r\n\r\nmeanings, the connotations and the different aspects and viewpoints so  that  if\r\n\r\nthe people are presented with all these arguments, then they will better be able\r\n\r\nto judge the issue when the question is posed to them for their answer.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out, Sir, that discussion in the Assembly first will prevent\r\n\r\nany  surprise  being sprung by the Government and a snap referendum  from  being\r\n\r\nheld. I will show you that, in fact, this provision has been put in because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intended to have a snap referendum and to take unfair  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition Parties. Let me try and give you the picture as we see it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Anson by-election, Sir, merger was the main issue of the various\r\n\r\nParties placed before the people. The Prime Minister on many occasions said at\r\n\r\nrallies that a vote for the P.A.P. was a vote for the P.A.P. merger. And he said\r\n\r\non  many  occasions too that the P.A.P. merger plans would be placed before  the\r\n\r\npeople for their final decision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid I have not made myself understood. I think\r\n\r\nthis  argument or this speech is working up to a debate on the second  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich is in the name of the Member for Anson, the Member for Queenstown and  the\r\n\r\nMember for Hong Lim, which seeks to add a paragraph.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Not more than one question shall be submitted to the electors in any one\r\n\r\nreferendum and such question shall contain only one issue and the electors shall\r\n\r\nonly be required to answer such question in the simple affirmative or negative',\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>and  allied  to that would be the amendment to clause 13, where the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  and the Member for Queenstown seek to leave out \"questions\" in  page  A3,\r\n\r\nline 41, and insert \"one question as framed by the Legislative Assembly\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried to indicate that in this particular clause we are not concerned\r\n\r\nwith whether there should be one question, two questions, or three questions. We\r\n\r\nare concerned with the matter in this particular case which has been referred by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown-of merger. So the debate should be on whether or  not\r\n\r\nany  matter of merger should go to referendum on the advice of a Minister at the\r\n\r\nrequest of the Legislative Assembly or merely on the advice of the Cabinet. That\r\n\r\nis all the issue at the moment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand that,\r\n\r\nSir. You remember in Select Committee I had given a brief outline of the referen\r\n\r\ndum  plot of the P.A.P. and I had indicated to you, Sir, that when the Bill came\r\n\r\nup for a fuller debate on recommittal, I would bring out the P.A.P. plot in each\r\n\r\nof  the  important clauses in the Bill. I am, only trying to draw your attention\r\n\r\nto one fact, namely, that the P.A.P. had intended to spring a snap referendum on\r\n\r\nthe  people. Since the intention was to spring a snap referendum, therefore, you\r\n\r\nfind now in the Bill the words \"Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers. . .\".  Now  I have indicated to you, Sir, that when the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara\r\n\r\nconsiders, he considers on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhad\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nintended  that it should be a snap referendum and there should be no proper  dis\r\n\r\ncussion in the Assembly. That is the meat of my contention, that it was part  of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. plot to have a snap referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Is it then on the alleged plot of the Government to have\r\n\r\na  snap  referendum on the matter of merger, or is it on the matter of questions\r\n\r\nconnected with merger? I would like to understand the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Of course, Sir, the matter and the question are ultimately\r\n\r\nlinked  up  and  on this particular issue as we all know, the  Government  have\r\n\r\nadmitted that this Bill is meant for the merger issue. However, I will skip that\r\n\r\npart,  Sir,  since  you think it is not proper to debate  it  right  now.  Our\r\n\r\ncontention, Sir, is that if there is full and frank discussion in the  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthen it would not allow the Government to spring a surprise on the Opposition or\r\n\r\non the people, and everybody will be able to know exactly what is forthcoming. I\r\n\r\nneed  only, Sir, to remind the House of the indecent haste of the Government  in\r\n\r\nthe presentation of Bills in 1959, in 1960 -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> You were here also.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and even in 1961. All these Bills had to be amended and\r\n\r\nreamended time and again because they were done in great haste without any  full\r\n\r\ndiscussion. In discussion we will be able to hiring out all the complexities and\r\n\r\nhidden  meanings that may be in the matter. For example, I gave  an  example  in\r\n\r\nSelect Committee about cars. But if people are informed that the getting of  a\r\n\r\ncar  will mean the payment of a sum of $10,000 and of a few hundred dollars for\r\n\r\nits  upkeep, then possibly a lot of people may not decide to have it. Similarly\r\n\r\nin  talking  of  the White Paper on the P.A.P. type of merger, the  fact,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens are to be made second-class citizens must be brought out.  We\r\n\r\nmust also bring out, for example -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> On a point of order. I think, Mr Speaker, we have to bring\r\n\r\nthe  Committee back to the rails. There is an amendment being proposed  in  the\r\n\r\nnames  of  the Member for Queenstown and the Member for Anson, and I  think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be able to proceed with our business more expeditiously if the proposition\r\n\r\nfor the amendment is based on arguments which are relevant.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have been trying to make myself clear, but I do not seem to\r\n\r\nhave  made myself clear. I think possibly the Member for Queenstown is  confused\r\n\r\nbecause in Select Committee there was, in fact, a proposition by the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  to alter the word \"matter\" to read \"question\" and that was when  all  the\r\n\r\nremarks  which were made by the Member for Queenstown were very relevant.  But\r\n\r\nnow there has been no suggestion that the word \"matter\" should read \"question\",\r\n\r\nand  I  have indicated that the word \"matter\", to my mind, could only  mean  one\r\n\r\nthing. It could mean- a subject matter which might import one question, two ques\r\n\r\ntions,  three  questions, or even four questions or more.  On  that  aspect  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown will, I think, have an opportunity to  put  forward  his\r\n\r\nviews  when we come to deal with the next amendment and other amendments on  the\r\n\r\nOrder Paper.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose-\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes.

The\r\n\r\ndebate was allowed to range over all the subsequent amendments.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will try and be as relevant as possible then, Sir. At the\r\n\r\npresent moment, the Government has the advantage of the Radio, Rediffusion  and\r\n\r\na  very  friendly  English Press that always presents the Government  point  of\r\n\r\nview.  I can quite understand why the English Press is always willing to  help,\r\n\r\nSir,I  understand, for example, that the circulation of the Sunday  Mail  was\r\n\r\nalmost  stopped, because they put up headlines which the P.A.P. did not  like.\r\n\r\nWell,  the P.A.P. can deny it if they like, but it is a fact. Again  it  shows\r\n\r\nhow dictatorial the P.A.P. is. Just because a headline is not to the liking  of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.,  a paper can be called up and warned that if it does not  toe  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. line,  its  circulation in Singapore will be  stopped.  It  was  very\r\n\r\nlucky,  Sir,  that  on this particular occasion, there were  frantic  telephone\r\n\r\ncalls between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I hate to\r\n\r\ninterrupt any Member in this particular debate because I know the debate  is  of\r\n\r\nnational  importance.  I  am  sure  the Member  for  Queenstown  will  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of putting in these little tidbits of his when we come to debate the\r\n\r\nother  amendments which I have indicated. Let us now keep to  the  issue  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether or not when it comes to asking the people to go to a referendum  on  any\r\n\r\nmatter - not on a specific question\r\n\r\n- the Government should advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara only at the request  of\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is possibly\r\n\r\nbecause the P.A.P. had been afraid of discussion that they did not want to  have\r\n\r\nthe  matter  discussed in the Assembly. In col. 307*, the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nsaid  that there was no precedent for Opposition Members to have a voice in  the\r\n\r\nframing of questions. Now, I am not talking of framing a question, Sir. I  just\r\n\r\nwant  to bring it home to you, because earlier on he had said that there was  no\r\n\r\nprecedent  in the whole world that there should be discussion in the  Assembly\r\n\r\nfirst. It was only later on when we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Official Report of Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 5\r\n\r\ndated 15th May, 1962.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nbrought  out  the fact that there was discussion in the Assembly in Jamaica  and\r\n\r\nquoted  other  instances too that he backed down and admitted that  he  made  an\r\n\r\nerror.  I  pointed  out, Sir, that although the P.A.P. claim  support  over  the\r\n\r\nmatter of the White Paper, they are afraid to let all the facts be known to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The P.A.P. have spent large sums of money collected in taxes  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  for propaganda and for the benefit of their own pet projects like  trips\r\n\r\nabroad, cultural teams, Malaysia Weeks, posters, banners, advertisements,  pamph\r\n\r\nlets  on  the matter of merger. All the time they have been trying to  publicise\r\n\r\nthat merger is a very good thing. Now, we have to tell the people in the case of\r\n\r\nthese  merger proposals how unfair and unjust the P.A.P. have been to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, it is only discussion in the Assembly that will bring  all  these\r\n\r\nthings out.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has already quoted to you international practice and I do\r\n\r\nnot  think  I need go into details. For example, I just mention the New  Zealand\r\n\r\nMilitary   Training   Poll  Act;  in  Jamaica,  France,   Switzerland,   Canada,\r\n\r\nNewfoundland, all over the world, Sir, wherever they hold referenda, the  matter\r\n\r\nis  first  discussed in the Assembly and it is not just done by  the  Government\r\n\r\nalone.  I need here only bring out the deceit and pretence of the P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\nwhole  referendum Bill. Whenever they are cornered and whenever they cannot  put\r\n\r\nup  any  more excuses, whenever their arguments cannot face up to the logic  and\r\n\r\nweight  of arguments on our side, they always go back to the same old argument\r\n\r\nthat this is a general Referendum Bill. It is always their pet excuse\r\n\r\n- this is a general Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have tried to indicate to the Member for Queenstown that all\r\n\r\nthese  choice remarks could, I think, very well be passed when we  come  to  the\r\n\r\nright  amendment. We are now on the matter of procedure actually, the matter  of\r\n\r\nprocedure  as  to  whether  or not when any matter  is  to  be  submitted  to  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara should make his order directing\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat  referendum on the advice of the Government alone or on the advice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at the request of the Legislative Assembly. Any matter  meaning  any\r\n\r\nmatter in general. Therefore, all these comments on what the P.A.P. are going to\r\n\r\ndo  about  it, the particular question relating to merger - those remarks  do  not\r\n\r\narise now; or rather they would arise, but whether they are proper or not  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferent  thing. The Chairman has to look after those remarks as he  will  hear\r\n\r\nonly  proper  parliamentary remarks. But I think that trend will arise  when  we\r\n\r\ndeal with the next amendment where there is an issue of one question yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that\r\n\r\nall  these  remarks  were passed in Select Committee while  we  were  discussing\r\n\r\nclause 5 - the first amendment. The same amendment -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have already indicated that when we were in Select\r\n\r\nCommittee there was an amendment to change the word \"matter\" to \"question\"  and\r\n\r\nbecause of that, all those remarks were relevant. I allowed the debate to  range\r\n\r\nover  that  amendment  and the amendment to clause 13, and  that  is  why  those\r\n\r\nremarks were allowed. But now no memher of the Opposition has chosen to move  an\r\n\r\namendment that the word \"matter\" should read \"question\". That being so, my  duty\r\n\r\nis  to  channel the debate to the proper issue. The proper issue is  as  I  have\r\n\r\nenunciated:  it  is  simply, when there is any matter  going  to  referendum - the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  merger,  the  matter of toddy-shops, or any matter,  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nsmoking  I  think was mentioned in Select Committee - whenever it is  considered\r\n\r\nthat  that  matter should go to referendum, then it is the Government  who  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  decide whether that matter should go, or is it the Government  at  the\r\n\r\nrequest of the Legislative Assembly? Anyway, when it comes to the detail  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat question will be asked on that particular matter, then so far as merger is\r\n\r\nconcerned, the Member for Queenstown will probably be in order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Under the circumstances, Sir, I do not wish to say\r\n\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\ngenerally  speaking, we can know from common knowledge that this  amendment\r\n\r\nconcerning whether the holding of the national referendum should be at  the\r\n\r\nrequest  of  the  Assembly or whether it should be at the  request  of  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  does  not  make very much difference. We now  feel  there  is  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  to  bring up this amendment purely because this  Government  has\r\n\r\nrecently  acted  in  such a way that there should be this  necessity.  That\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that  if  the Opposition is faced with a Government  which  is\r\n\r\nfairly  and  sincerely practising democracy, then there would  not  be  any\r\n\r\nnecessity  for us to bring up such an amendment. But now we  must  realise\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  in the state of experimenting with parliamentary  democracy,\r\n\r\nand  in the course of the past two years of such experiment, we have  seen\r\n\r\nthat  the  Party in power has not done well. It has acted in  such  a  very\r\n\r\nimmature  way that we must bring up this amendment. Therefore, if  the  Government  has  not said that the Opposition can carry out canvassing  during\r\n\r\nthe  period of national referendum, and if the Government does not give  us\r\n\r\nsufficient  time  to carry out canvassing, we will have to  bring  up  this\r\n\r\namendment.  Unless and until the Government indicates that sufficient  time\r\n\r\nwill  be  given to us for the purpose of canvassing, we will have to  bring\r\n\r\nup  this  amendment.  In the course of debate on this  National  Referendum\r\n\r\nBill, the Government has shown that it has acted against\r\n\r\nthe principles  of democracy, and therefore we find the necessity  to  bring  up\r\n\r\nthis  amendment. This amendment, in my personal opinion, will help  us  in\r\n\r\nthe  experiment  of parliamentary democracy. If there is no evil  intention\r\n\r\non  the  part of the Government, then I see no reason why it should  refuse\r\n\r\nthis amendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  support the amendment moved by  the  Member  for  Anson.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  amendment  is  of  trifling  importance  compared  to   the\r\n\r\namendments\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  clause  5  and clause 29, which are decisive and would make  all  the\r\n\r\ndifference  whether the coming merger referendum is going to be  an  honest\r\n\r\nor  a dishonest referendum, yet I think if the Government would accept this\r\n\r\namendment,  it would improve the National Referendum Bill as a general  law\r\n\r\nfor future referenda.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the difference between the present clause and the amendment,\r\n\r\nif  the  Government accepts it, is that the Opposition Parties would be given  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  ventilate their views on any matter which is of sufficient  national\r\n\r\nimportance  and  which the Government wishes to present  to  the  people  for  a\r\n\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present clause, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is only the Government which\r\n\r\nadvises  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara to put such an issue to  the  people  in  a\r\n\r\nreferendum, and the people would be given only 14 days' notice under clause 6 to\r\n\r\nweigh  the pros and cons of such an issue. But if the Government is prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept the amendment, then what would happen is that such an issue, before being\r\n\r\nput  to the people for a verdict, would first of all be submitted to this  House\r\n\r\nfor  a  thorough debate. This would be in the interest of the democratic  system\r\n\r\nbecause  then  the people would be informed of all the pros and cons,  all  the\r\n\r\naspects of the issue as seen from all angles, and I think that would be  in  the\r\n\r\ninterest of the country.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I say the request by the Opposition Parties is a fair\r\n\r\nrequest. We do not ask for anything more - just let the Opposition have a  chance\r\n\r\nto ventilate their views for the interest of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if the term\r\n\r\n\"national referendum\" is to be interpreted into Chinese, then it should  be  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the people. That would mean that when a matter is approved  by  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  or  any  governmental organisation, it should go  to  the  people  for\r\n\r\nconfirmation  or  rejection  as to whether this  decision  of  the  Assembly  or\r\n\r\nparliamentary organisation should be adopted. That is the true\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmeaning  and definition of a national referendum. Therefore, today the amendment\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for Anson and the Member for Queenstown is very reasonable  and-rational. It is in the interest of the people and it is in compliance  with  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of a national referendum. When this National Referendum Bill was brought\r\n\r\nup  for  Second  Reading,  the  Minister concerned  told  this  House  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment would have to spend some $400,000 to carry out a national referendum.\r\n\r\nNow this $400,000 has to be approved by the Legislative Assembly before it could\r\n\r\nbe  spent  on the national referendum. Therefore, we can see clearly that  since\r\n\r\nthe national referendum will cost some $400,000, which is to come as a result of\r\n\r\nthe approval by this House, then a national referendum must, in the first place,\r\n\r\nbe  approved  by the Legislative Assembly before the Minister for  Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nadvises the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to bring it to the people for a decision.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of a national referendum is usually one of\r\n\r\nnational  importance. That being so, we in the Legislative Assembly,  which  is\r\n\r\nthe  supreme authority in this country, must have a say in the matter before  it\r\n\r\ncan  be  referred  to the people; in other words, such a matter  must  first  be\r\n\r\ndebated in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see that on item 3 of the Order Paper, the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has brought up a motion concerning the reclamation of Upper East  Coast\r\n\r\nRoad.  This  is  only  a matter of little importance, but  even  so,  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has to get the approval of the Assembly before the work can be  carried\r\n\r\nout.  But,  comparatively speaking, a national referendum  matter  is  far  more\r\n\r\nimportant  than this. So there is all the more reason why this matter  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  national referendum should be debated in this House before the Minister for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs can advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to issue an order  to  carry\r\n\r\nout  the  national  referendum.  So, what we  are  requesting  now  is  actually\r\n\r\nconducive to the true\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmeaning  of  the term \"national referendum\". It is a very legitimate request  we\r\n\r\nare  making.  We  see no reason why the Government cannot accept this  amendment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  coming  from the Opposition. We must not allow a matter  of  national\r\n\r\nimportance to be dealt with by the Government alone and in a unilateral manner.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 7 of the Bill says that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nhas  the  power  to  postpone a national referendum. Since the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara can decide the holding of a national referendum and also postpone such  a\r\n\r\nnational  referendum, then I would say that the Government will spend a  lot  of\r\n\r\nmoney when conditions are to their favour.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. To put the record right, I think the hon. Member has been\r\n\r\ninterpreted  as  having  said  that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  has  power  ta\r\n\r\npostpone  a referendum under clause 7. Well, clause 7 reads:- \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If at any time\r\n\r\nafter the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  has  issued the order referred to in section 5 of this Ordinance  it  is\r\n\r\nshown  to his satisfaction that owing to any cause whatsoever no referendum  has\r\n\r\nbeen  held  in  pursuance  of such order, he may at any  time  thereafter  issue\r\n\r\nanother order for the same purpose.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>So,  it  is  not a question of postponing. It is a question of if the referendum\r\n\r\nhas not in fact been held.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I meant to say that the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, on the advice of the Cabinet, feels that if  conditions\r\n\r\nduring  this  period are unfavourable to the Government, then  the  Cabinet  can\r\n\r\nadvise  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to change the time for  the  holding  of  a\r\n\r\nnational referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out very clearly here that since this\r\n\r\nis a mattter of a national referendum, it should be referred to the Assembly. It\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  left in the hands of the Government at a time when  things  are\r\n\r\nfavourable to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is my personal opinion that if the Government wishes\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  comply  with  the  principles of democracy,  then  the, amendment  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  must be accepted by the Government unconditionally.  The  Government\r\n\r\nhas no reason to reject it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's arguments against\r\n\r\nthe  principle of this amendment in the Select Committee were somewhat  childish\r\n\r\nand  puerile. The Government's attitude was, in fact, such that it  amounted  to\r\n\r\nsaying, \"This is my business and you shut up!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is very much the behaviour of an upstart child. The whole attitude\r\n\r\nof  the Government seems to be governed by its belief that it can insist on  its\r\n\r\nso-called  rights of a government and disregard the feelings of the  people.  It\r\n\r\nappears to the P.A.P. that forms are all important - so important that they  throw\r\n\r\nout reason and sense and forget their obligation to the people and the necessity\r\n\r\nfor fair play. The way the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  conducts itself illustrates the extent of degeneration  that\r\n\r\nhas set in. They imagine that once they have been elected they have the right to\r\n\r\nplay  ducks and drakes with the people. I do not think it is because the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters are so dull as to lack a sense of logic. It is just that they want  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  our people are kept ignorant and confused on any  matter  put  or\r\n\r\nreferred to them in a referendum, and particularly on the merger issue. This  is\r\n\r\nevident.  They  deliberately  close  all  doors  for  a  full,  frank  and  free\r\n\r\ndiscussion.  Ignorance  and  confusion on the referendum,  particularly  on  the\r\n\r\nmatter of merger, fits very well into the P.A.P. scheme of things, because  that\r\n\r\nis the only way they can survive.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on this Bill so far held in Select Committee, their argu\r\n\r\nments  were  directed  at  clouding and confusing the  issue.  The  Government's\r\n\r\nattitude to the principle of this amendment in the Select Committee - they have up\r\n\r\nto  now  kept  quiet, I do not know whether they want to put  forward  the  same\r\n\r\narguments - can  be  summed up to be replies that were advanced to arguments  that\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition had not put forward, instead of giving replies to arguments that\r\n\r\nthe Opposition had,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  fact,  put  forward.  Sir, the Government rejected!  the  principle  of  the\r\n\r\namendment in the Select Committee on three grounds, namely, one, that  it  would\r\n\r\ninfringe  upon the authority of the Government to refer a matter for referendum;\r\n\r\ntwo,  that  it would involve the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in a public controversy,\r\n\r\nand three, that certain gentlemen, namely, Mr F. Fernandez and company and' Mr\r\n\r\nAng  Kim Thye and company, had made representations to the contrary. Sir,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom these three feeble reasons, the Government has not been able to put forward-any sound logical reasons for its rejection.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine these reasons and ascertain their validity. To start with,\r\n\r\npoints  two  and three are uncalled for, because we have not suggested  that  we\r\n\r\ndesire  to  infringe  upon  the authority of the  Government  and  we  have  not\r\n\r\nsuggested  that we desire to bring the Yang di-Pertuan Negara into  any  public\r\n\r\ncontroversy. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis is not asking the Government to assign to\r\n\r\nthe Opposition any of its functions or rights. We are not interested. We are not\r\n\r\nanxious to drag the Head of State into a public controversy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On point one, Sir, will acceptance of this amendment infringe upon the\r\n\r\nauthority of the Government to refer any matter to a referendum? The answer is a\r\n\r\nclear  no.  The  Government  has a majority in this House.  Although  it  is  an\r\n\r\nuncomfortable majority of one, nevertheless it is a majority. So long as that is\r\n\r\nthe  case,  whatever is the decision of the Assembly it will, in  effect,  be  a\r\n\r\ndecision  of  the  Government with or without the Opposition's support.  In  the\r\n\r\npresent Assembly, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. need not doubt the support of\r\n\r\ncertain  Opposition  Parties  like U.M.N.O. How will  the  Government  lose  its\r\n\r\nfunctions?  The  statement, Sir, by the Minister for Home Affairs  in  the  last\r\n\r\nsentence  of  the  Official  Report of the Select  Committee  on  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962, col. 89, reads:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Government consider that the right to hold a referendum on any matter and\r\n\r\nany  time,  if  it  is  in the public interest to do so, is  a  matter  for  the\r\n\r\nExecutive and not the legislative power.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThis  is  not only irrelevant but also misleading. It shows utter  confusion\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the position will be such that the Government will have the right to\r\n\r\ndecide  on  a referendum on any matter, because in this House the Government\r\n\r\nhas a majority. The decision of the final form of the actual question to  be\r\n\r\nput  to the people will rest with the Government, because the Government has\r\n\r\na  majority in this House. No question can be put to the electorate  against\r\n\r\nthe  will of the Government, because the Government has a majority  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  As  long  as the Government has a majority in this Assembly,  as  in\r\n\r\nfact  the Government should rightly have, it means that it is the Government\r\n\r\nthat  decides on whether to hold a referendum, when to hold (he  referendum,\r\n\r\nand on what matter to hold a referendum.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thorough discussion on any subject for a referendum is a function of\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly. We must not confuse the issue. The Government's bluff as  to\r\n\r\nlosing  its  rights, etc., is merely meant to confuse and detract  from  the\r\n\r\nissue.  Sir, the purpose of this amendment is clear. It is not to usurp  the\r\n\r\nfunctions of the Government. It is to allow free and full discussion by  the\r\n\r\n51  representatives  of  the  people on a  matter  to  be  referred  t)  the\r\n\r\nelectorate in a referendum so that the voters are clear about the  arguments\r\n\r\nfor and against that matter.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in rejecting this amendment - I do not know whether they want to\r\n\r\nreject  it,  but from their performance in the Select Committee the  chances\r\n\r\nare  that they would reject it - the Government would be rejecting a  call  to\r\n\r\nallow  full  and  proper  discussion on any  question  by  all  the  elected\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  the people before the question on that  matter  can  be\r\n\r\nactually put to the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Point two, Sir, the Government's suggestion that if the principle of\r\n\r\nthis amendment is accepted, then the Yang di-Pertuan Negara will be involved  in\r\n\r\na  public controversy is even more ridiculous. I wish to quote the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLaw  who  repeatedly harped on this point in the Select Committee.  I  refer  to\r\n\r\ncolumn  86  of  the  same Official Report, the last line, the last  sentence  in\r\n\r\ncolumn 86:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If it is to be now provided that the Head of State must act on the advice of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative  Assembly, it will follow that his acts will  be  brought  into\r\n\r\npublic controversy.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>How  can the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be involved in a public controversy? He will\r\n\r\nnot and cannot take sides in the debates of this House. Is the Government trying\r\n\r\nto  suggest that he may be politically biased one way or the other? Today,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Government is supposed to make the laws of the country, but this  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  it  can  jolly  well make whatever laws it pleases  without  first\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  Legislative  Assembly. The  Government  is  constitutionally\r\n\r\nrequired to bring the proposed laws to this Assembly for\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndebate  and adoption. Only if the Assembly passes them can they be sent  to  the\r\n\r\nYang di-Pertuan Negara for his sanction. On the logic of the P.A.P. Government's\r\n\r\nargument,  this  must  mean that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  has  already  been\r\n\r\ninvolved  in a public controversy. But has this been the case? Perhaps  only  in\r\n\r\none  instance  and  only  one  instance,  and  for  that  the  P.A.P. is  fully\r\n\r\nresponsible.  You will remember, Sir, having agreed to and supported  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  Bill  in  this  Assembly, they quietly slipped out through  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nbackdoor  and told the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to hold up the legislation.  What\r\n\r\ncynicism  and  what hypocrisy, Sir! I cannot believe that the Hon. Minister  for\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs,  the Hon. Minister for Finance and the Hon. Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\ncould have offered this argument with any seriousness. They must be scraping the\r\n\r\nbottom of the barrel in their desperate attempt to justify their case. I repeat,\r\n\r\nSir, today our Constitution is such that all Bills are only sent to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for assent after this Assembly passes them. The practice is  that\r\n\r\nno  Bill  can  be  assented to by him if this Assembly does not  pass  it.  This\r\n\r\npractice has not brought the Head of State into any public controversy, and  its\r\n\r\ncontinuance need not necessarily bring him into one in the future. An  extension\r\n\r\nof  this  practice  to  include referenda on matters of national  importance,  I\r\n\r\nsubmit,  Sir,  need not necessarily bring him into any public  controversy.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment's bluff once again is merely meant to mislead and confuse the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the third point, I need not say very much. In fact, the names of the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives   speak  for  themselves.  Sir,  they  are   well-known   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nenthusiasts. Their representations have the Government's blessing,  so  much  so\r\n\r\nthat the only argument the Minister for Home Affairs in the Select Committee was\r\n\r\nable to do was to quote two paragraphs. From their representations - I think it is\r\n\r\ncolumn  90 - he said, \"I think these two passages put the Government's  case  very\r\n\r\nclearly, and I do not think I need elaborate further on this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmatter.\" I would like to read these two paragraphs. I would like to quote  from\r\n\r\nthe top of the column:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If you will permit me, Mr Chairman, may I quote two short passages from the\r\n\r\nmemorandum submitted by certain gentlemen? I refer to Paper No. 5, paragraph  4,\r\n\r\nwhich says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There is no precedent in the world where a section of opposition in the As\r\n\r\nsembly,  which  does not shoulder the responsibilities of government  is  given\r\n\r\nthe  right to decide what the Government should ask the people in a referendum.\r\n\r\nFor  the opposition to demand this concession is akin to asking for a share  in\r\n\r\nthe  administration to which it is not entitled. If the Government were to give\r\n\r\nin  to  this demand, it might as well hand over the reins of Government to  the\r\n\r\nopposition and allow the opposition to run the Referendum...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And in paragraph 4 of Paper No. 6, I quote again:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It is the universal practice in every democratic country for the Government\r\n\r\nin  power  to set the questions. There is logical reason for this. A referendum\r\n\r\nis  a  method whereby the Government in power wishes to test public opinion  on\r\n\r\nany  matter of its own choosing. It is not intended to be a vote for or against\r\n\r\na  particular  Government  or  Party.  Therefore  the  question  on  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants  to  ascertain  public opinion  is  logically  a  matter  for\r\n\r\nGovernment to decide.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  after  quoting this, Sir, all the Minister did say was, \"I think these  two\r\n\r\npassages  put  the Government's case very clearly, and- I do not  think  I  need\r\n\r\nelaborate further on this matter.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, surely they put the Government's case quite rightly, because they are\r\n\r\nP.A.P. representations. However, these two paragraphs quoted give  a  distorted\r\n\r\nversion  of  the  Opposition's stand. I do not know whether the  Government  had\r\n\r\ndeliberately told these representors that this was, in fact, the demand  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition,  but  anyway, these two paragraphs contained in  the  representation\r\n\r\ngive  a  distorted version of the stand of the Opposition. My arguments as  laid\r\n\r\ndown  in  points one and two earlier completely invalidate this distorted  claim\r\n\r\nthat the Opposition seeks to take over the functions of the Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, Sir, even if the Minister wished to accept the representation, he\r\n\r\nmust at least show a sense of balance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThis  representation  was  made by 8 individuals  who  represented  no  one  but\r\n\r\nthemselves.  But  mass  organisations like the group of  38  Trade  Unions,  two\r\n\r\nHawkers' Associations, two Associations of Rural Dwellers and 32 Associations of\r\n\r\nOld Boys made representations to the contrary. Their sentiments are embodied  in\r\n\r\nthe amendment before the Committee.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these organisations, put together, represent well over one hundred thou\r\n\r\nsand   members,   one  hundred  thousand  bodies  who  are  members   of   these\r\n\r\norganisations. Well, if you add their families, their number will be  more  than\r\n\r\ndouble.  In  addition  to  this, the P.M.I.P. and the Liberal  Socialists  both\r\n\r\nsupported the sentiments expressed in the amendment. Sir, if the Government want\r\n\r\nto  accept  popular representation, surely the proper thing to do is  to  accept\r\n\r\nthese  amendments  and not to reject them and quote the words of  8  subservient\r\n\r\nindividuals to substantiate the rejection.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I maintain that our request is perfectly legitimate. There are precedents\r\n\r\nand  they  have been quoted in the Select Committee. A referendum,  particularly\r\n\r\nthe  forthcoming referendum on merger, is of national importance. It affects the\r\n\r\nlives  of  all our people and their future and that of generations to come.  The\r\n\r\nconduct of such a referendum cannot be left at the hands of one political Party.\r\n\r\nThey  should  not be left, above all, in the hands of a discredited Party  whose\r\n\r\ndishonesty is evident. An Assembly decision will, in fact, meet the view of  the\r\n\r\nmajority, namely, that of the Government, yet the discussion and the debate will\r\n\r\nbe useful to all our people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government accept this amendment, it is not because they have all of a\r\n\r\nsudden  become  generous; it is because they are fully  aware  of  the  pressure\r\n\r\noutside;  it  is because they are fully aware of the resentment -of the  people;\r\n\r\nand  if  the Government accept this amendment, then it shall be a gain  for  the\r\n\r\npeople and not a concession given by the P.A.P. to the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nBut,  Sir, if the Government rejects this, then the question the Government  has\r\n\r\nto  answer is whether it is prepared to allow a thorough discussion by  all  the\r\n\r\nelected representatives of the people before they are expected to decide on  the\r\n\r\nmatter. I hope that our Ministers will not come back and tell us that this is a\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill for merger, that the merger issue has already been discussed- in\r\n\r\nthe Assembly and that therefore there is no need to have this amendment. This is\r\n\r\nsomething  which they have already said in Select Committee and  it  is  just  a\r\n\r\ncontradiction  of  their other argument advanced on the basis  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill. I say to them, Sir, whether this is a merger Referendum\r\n\r\nBill  or  a general Referendum Bill, our amendments and arguments state that  we\r\n\r\nask  the  Government to bring to this Assembly the matter - or  any  matter - to  be\r\n\r\nreferred  to the people in a referendum. We ask the Government to allow  the  51\r\n\r\nelected  representatives of this House to debate that matter first so  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  will know of the arguments for and against that matter. This  should  be\r\n\r\ndone well before a referendum is held so that the people will have more time  to\r\n\r\nconsider the merits or otherwise of the issues put to them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose and resumed his seat immediately afterwards.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> The Minister for Finance always wants to stand up and put forward\r\n\r\nwhatever arguments he has and if he is going to tell us that merger has  already\r\n\r\nbeen  decided,  then  I  need only quote his colleague, the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs,  who  says that this is a general Referendum Bill. My  point  is  this,\r\n\r\nwhether it is a general Referendum Bill or a merger Referendum Bill, the  matter\r\n\r\nmust be discussed in the Legislative Assembly. However, Sir, I will keenly await\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Home Affairs, the Minister for Finance  and  the  most  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Law and their colleagues to put forward whatever  arguments  they\r\n\r\nhave.  The  Minister  for Law very categorically says that the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara will be involved in a public controversy if this\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\namendment  is accepted. I would like to see the logic, Sir,I want the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Law to substantiate that publicly. As I said, I keenly await the arguments,\r\n\r\nas  I  am  sure,  Sir, that since the Government have been generous  enough  to\r\n\r\nsuspend Standing Orders for this debate to go on till midnight, we can all  sit\r\n\r\nhere until midnight day in and day out, but they need not be impatient\r\n\r\n- as  I  thought the Deputy Prime Minister was impatient - because when they  found\r\n\r\ntoo  many  Barisan Sosialis speakers, they asked, \"Why do you want this  discuss\r\n\r\nthis  small matter at such great length?\" But we are prepared. Let them come  at\r\n\r\nthe proper time and put forward their case. If the Government are not afraid  to\r\n\r\ngive the people every possible opportunity to know the arguments for and against\r\n\r\nan issue or a question, then they must accept the amendment. The purpose of this-amendment,  as  I have stated, is to allow a full, free and frank discussion  on\r\n\r\nany  matter that is to be put to the people before it is actually put  to  them.\r\n\r\nThis  is because, Sir, we, unlike the P.A.P., want our people to understand  and\r\n\r\nconsider clearly any matter before they vote on it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today the practice of parliamentary democracy in\r\n\r\nSingapore has come to a crisis; that is to say, parliamentary democracy  is  now\r\n\r\nundergoing a very serious test in our country. Under parliamentary democracy, we\r\n\r\nhave   a   Party   in  power  and  Parties  in  the  Opposition  consisting   of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the people who have the right to air their views  on  matters\r\n\r\nof  national  importance  so  that  the Government  can  practise  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  the proper manner. But, unfortunately, we can see  clearly  today\r\n\r\nthat  the  system of parliamentary democracy is now faced with  a  very  serious\r\n\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convening of sittings in this Assembly should aim at discussing matters\r\n\r\npertaining  to  the political situation in the State or to the security  of  the\r\n\r\nnation,  or  the welfare of the nation. These subjects should be the  topics  of\r\n\r\ndiscussion in the Assembly. For example,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  the Order Paper today, we have a motion on \"Reclamation of Upper East  Coast\r\n\r\nRoad\",  but  here  we  have a more serious matter, a matter which  concerns  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore. We have this Singapore National Referendum Bill which deals\r\n\r\nwith the constitutional progress and future of Singapore.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government has brought up a matter concerning the whole nation for\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  a  matter concerning partly the administration of  the  Government,\r\n\r\nthen  this matter which concerns the whole interest of the people and the  whole\r\n\r\nfuture of Singapore should not be overlooked by the Government. They seem to  be\r\n\r\ntrying  to leave this matter out of the hands of the Assembly. In trying  to  do\r\n\r\nso, the practice of parliamentary democracy becomes a farce.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that Members of the House have been elected by the people in order\r\n\r\nthat  the views of the people can be reflected in the Assembly. Now, since  this\r\n\r\nmatter concerns the entire people of Singapore, the Government should not try to\r\n\r\ntake it out of the hands of the Assembly. They should not deny a full discussion\r\n\r\nin the Assembly. So we want to find out why the Government are afraid to discuss\r\n\r\nand debate this matter in the Assembly. The Government do not only try to refuse\r\n\r\na  discussion in the Assembly but they also try to stop the leaders in the civil\r\n\r\norganisations  from airing their views. They even try to ask the newspapers  not\r\n\r\nto  publish  the  opinions  of the civic organisations.  We  have  received  two\r\n\r\nrepresentations  from  78  civic  organisations  and  we  can  see  from   these\r\n\r\nrepresentations what their views are on this matter.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I asked why the Government was afraid to discuss the matter in the\r\n\r\nAssembly.  If  they  are  sincere, and are prepared  to  practise  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  the  proper manner, then on a matter which  concerns  the  entire\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, the Government should allow a discussion in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIf  they are sincere, then I see no reason why the Government should act  in  an\r\n\r\narbitrary manner on the national referendum. If they want to veto the amendment,\r\n\r\nthen we can only come to one conclusion, and that is they want to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndestroy  the system of parliamentary democracy. They should not behave in  this\r\n\r\nmanner,  otherwise it would mean that they are indulging in  a  secret  selling\r\n\r\nout of the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that the P.A.P. Government are now in the act of destroying parliamen\r\n\r\ntary  democracy. In the present situation, they have lost faith in parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  When the Prime Minister came back from abroad, he said  at  a  Press\r\n\r\nconference  that in Egypt there was no Opposition and, therefore, the  Party  in\r\n\r\npower  did  not allow the Opposition parties to disrupt the cordial relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Government and the people. In the opinion of the  Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nthat  system  was better and it brought about quicker progress than  what  India\r\n\r\ncould do, because in India, there are Opposition Parties whose opposition to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policies slow down Government work and thereby delay progress.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, from these talks of the Government Ministers, we can draw a conclusion,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the parliamentary democracy in Singapore is now under a very  serious\r\n\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 5 (1) simply reads thus:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers that it is in the public\r\n\r\ninterest  to  do so he may by order direct that any matter be submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nelectors for a referendum.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a few minutes ago the Member for Upper Serangoon alleged\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government was immature and not adhering to constitutional  practice.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I would say if we had a more mature Opposition, this amendment\r\n\r\nwould  not  have been brought to this Assembly for debate in the first instance.\r\n\r\nThis is a procedural clause and is the practice in all democratic countries.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under the constitution, as in all constitutions patterned on\r\n\r\nthe  British system of parliamentary democracy, the Head of State, in this  case\r\n\r\nthe Yang di-Pertuan Negara, is obliged to act in accordance with the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nadvice  of  the Government. The Government in turn is responsible to the  Legis\r\n\r\nlative  Assembly  for  the acts of the Head of State. It is  essential  that  in\r\n\r\nexercising his powers under legislation the acts of the Head of State should not\r\n\r\nbe brought into public controversy. I am sure, as a lawyer, the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nis  better informed on this aspect of the function of the Head of State  than  I\r\n\r\nam.  He  will  also realise that this position is untenable if the provision  is\r\n\r\nmade  for  the  Head  of  State to act on the advice of the  Assembly.  However,\r\n\r\nevidently one blunder does not make him a wiser man.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment today does not alter the essence of the original\r\n\r\namendment of the Member for Anson. There is an old Chinese saying for this.  The\r\n\r\nsoup is changed but not the medicine. I shall leave this constitutional argument\r\n\r\nin  more expert hands than the Member for Anson's. In any case, this is not  the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of the amendment. The real purpose of the amendment  is  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis Assemblymen and the Member for Anson sought to  arrogate  unto\r\n\r\nthemselves the right to dictate whether there should be a referendum and, if so,\r\n\r\nwhen.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it has already been pointed out in Select Committee that in\r\n\r\nno  country  in  the  world where parliamentary democracy is  practised  that  a\r\n\r\nsection of the Opposition which does not shoulder the responsibilities of govern\r\n\r\nment  be  given any executive power. The Government consider that the  right  to\r\n\r\nhold a referendum on any matter and at any time, if it is in the public interest\r\n\r\nto do so, is the function of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real point at issue today is whether matter of national importance will be\r\n\r\nbrought  before the Assembly for debate prior to a referendum being held.  This,\r\n\r\nas  has  been  explained in the Select Committee, the Government  will  do.  All\r\n\r\nmatters  of  national importance, for which the Government consider a  national.\r\n\r\nreferendum is necessary, will be brought before the Assembly for debate, so that\r\n\r\nthere will be, in the words of the Member for Queenstown, a free, full and frank\r\n\r\ndiscussion in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were, as indeed the Government had done in the case of the proposed\r\n\r\nmerger referendum, indeed free,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nfull and frank discussions in the Assembly for days on end. Mr Speaker, Sir, if\r\n\r\nyou  remember, the Member for Queens-town nearly bored all of us to  tears  with\r\n\r\nhis  seven-and-a-half-hour  speech in the Assembly  on  the  merger  issue.  And\r\n\r\nprevious to this Assembly debate, the merger issue had, in fact, been aired  for\r\n\r\nquite  sometime  and  subsequent to the Assembly debate  there  were  even  more\r\n\r\ndiscussions.  Mass  meetings were called by the Barisan Sosialis  and  house-to-house  canvassing organized, unfortunately, more with a view to scaring and  con\r\n\r\nfusing  the  people. Be that as it may, the Barisan Sosialis and the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  cannot  deny  that  merger, an issue of  national  importance,  has  been\r\n\r\nthoroughly  ventilated  in the Assembly. And, in fact, the  Government  is  even\r\n\r\nprepared to go further, if need be. The Government is even prepared, as has been\r\n\r\nstated  by  the  Minister for Finance, to debate the details, and  that  is  the\r\n\r\nquestions to be put in a referendum for debate in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hock Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hock Guan (Changi):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Referendum Bill is a very important Bill.

We do not care whether\r\n\r\nor not it is important to the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  But we do care, because it is important for all the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we have this amendment, in order to prevent the P.A.P. from  doing\r\n\r\ndishonest things which may cause disastrous events in Singapore.

Sir, the practice of parliamentary democracy in Singapore is  now  in\r\n\r\ndanger.  It is because there are a few political beggars who are now  in  power,\r\n\r\nand  who keep on destroying the system of parliamentary democracy. Sir,  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

Ministers were elected by the people in 1959, when they were\r\n\r\nhonest  to  them,  but  now  the P.A.P. leaders will betray  the  people.  They,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  dare  not face the people and give them a chance  to  express  their\r\n\r\nopinion  and to choose what they want.

May I - I know you understand  it,  Sir,\r\n\r\nbut may I for the record: Clause 5 reads: \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara considers that it is in the public\r\n\r\ninterest  to  do so he may by order direct that any matter be submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nelectors for a referendum.'  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  what does the amendment ask? That instead of the\r\n\r\nword \"considers\" it should now read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is advised\r\n\r\nby the Minister at the  request of the Legislative Assembly.'  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Legislative Assembly unfortunately is not the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nplus  the Member for Anson, as you are fully aware. The Legislative Assembly  in\r\n\r\nessence is, in fact, the majority party which is the Government. So to say  that\r\n\r\nin  making this amendment we arrogate to ourselves the right to dictate  when  a\r\n\r\nreferendum should be held is. I suggest, Sir, intended merely for their  friends\r\n\r\nof  P.A.P. Radio and the frightened members of the Press who give them  all  the\r\n\r\nspace  which they seem to require. It is not intended to convince you or  us  or\r\n\r\nanybody.  This  argument  was  advanced if you  will  remember,  in  Select  Com\r\n\r\nmittee - and was met in Select Committee - and whatever my personal views may be  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Home Affairs, I do not and never thought him quite so stupid as\r\n\r\nto  be incapable of following a very simple and logical argument. That is how we\r\n\r\nseek to arrogate to dictate if there should be a referendum and, if so, when, by\r\n\r\nasking that the Legislative Assembly should debate it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next he said, Sir, that he does not mind and the Government does not mind if\r\n\r\nthese  matters are thoroughly debated in the Assembly. But that is all it seeks.\r\n\r\nIf,  in  fact, they do not mind, why this strenuous objection? That is  all,  in\r\n\r\nessence.  What does the amendment seek? That the matter be fully debated  before\r\n\r\nit is submitted to His\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nExcellency  for his Order.

Be it enacted by the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  with  the  advice and consent of the  Legislative  Assembly  of\r\n\r\nSingapore...'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>He  is  asking  in this Bill that we should advise and consent to the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara  enacting  this law. It is part of his constitutional  function,\r\n\r\nSir.  You  know,  and we all know, but in order to meet this  specious  argument\r\n\r\nwhich  was  advanced by the Minister for Law and the highly sensitive atmosphere\r\n\r\nseemingly  associated with His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  you  will\r\n\r\nnotice,  Sir, that our amendment says that it is the Minister who should  advise\r\n\r\nhim but before the Minister advises him we should request the Minister. So, even\r\n\r\nif it is true - and it is not, we all know - so that the people should not be misled\r\n\r\nby  any  suggestion of encroachment upon the prerogative of His  Excellency,  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  amendment whereby it is now required that the  Minister  should\r\n\r\nadvise  him.  In  fact,  that is what is normally done. That  is  admitted.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  is still advising him. But we say that the Minister should not  advise\r\n\r\nHis Excellency until we request the Minister. There goes the other argument.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, Sir, with inflated chest, \"We are going to allow the questions to be\r\n\r\ndebated  which  are  going to go into this referendum.\"  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  un\r\n\r\nfortunately for the P.A.P., there is a Constitution, a Constitution  which  they\r\n\r\nhave  to work under and which in this Assembly is administered by you, and there\r\n\r\nare the Standing Orders which permit the Opposition to bring up motions, and  it\r\n\r\nis  thanks  to a motion from the Opposition that the questions which are  to  be\r\n\r\nposed  by the referendum are going to be discussed - no thanks to the P.A.P!  They\r\n\r\nnever  gave  and never intended to give any opportunity to anybody  to  discuss.\r\n\r\nThey have consistently avoided any suggestion of debating the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nquestions  or  telling us what the questions exactly were to  be.

But I was only giving an example show\r\n\r\ning  you  what the consequences would be after having such a Referendum Bill  as\r\n\r\nthis. In clause 5, the Government want to provide for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nto  order the holding of a national referendum. But it is not very good  because\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly is the highest body in the State. Usually, when  there\r\n\r\nis  pressure  on the Government, then it will decide whether or not  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nnational  referendum.  That  means the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  will  order  the\r\n\r\nholding  of  a  national  referendum at the discretion of  the  Government.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if you have not read about the Chinese novel, Travels to the West,\r\n\r\nyou would not understand that there is a so-called Monkey God who, according  to\r\n\r\nthe  novel, knows all sorts of tricks and magic. When this Monkey God  caused  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  trouble in the heavenly palace - it appears from the novel that he  is  a\r\n\r\nhero - a war ensued between the heavenly army's guards and the Monkey God. I would\r\n\r\nsay  that  if you do not have such tricks and magic such as the Monkey God  has,\r\n\r\nyou  will not win a battle. But there is another God or, rather Fairy. When this\r\n\r\nMonkey God changed itself into other forms, this Fairy also changed into a  form\r\n\r\nsuperior  to that of the Monkey God, so that he could always defeat  the  Monkey\r\n\r\nGod. Say, the Monkey God at first changed\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ninto  a  worm,  then  the other Fairy changed itself  into  a  fish.  After\r\n\r\nseveral  changes, such as changing into a house or a temple,  and  what-not\r\n\r\nthe Monkey God in the end was unable to change itself into any form.

As I have  said,  perhaps\r\n\r\nunder pressure the Government will hold a national referendum just as  what\r\n\r\nI have said, like the Monkey God changing itself into several forms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this point, what I mean is that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.     Government,  if  they want to have  a  clean  record  of  having\r\n\r\npractised democracy and having recorded as having held an honest  and  fair\r\n\r\nnational  referendum,  should  accept  the  amendment.  In  doing  so,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment should let the Assembly have a chance to debate and discuss  and\r\n\r\nadvise the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara, otherwise it is not too good.

Parliamentary democracy does not mean\r\n\r\nthat  every  Member of the Assembly should speak. Parties  have  their  own\r\n\r\nWhips  to  decide how many speeches there should be and how  relevant  each\r\n\r\nspeech should be. Mr Tee\r\n\r\nKim Leng.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, today this House is discussing the\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum Bill. I believe that all Members  of  the  House  have\r\n\r\nreceived  from various civic organisations and trade unions copies  of  the\r\n\r\nmemoranda.  [hey have clearly shown that if this House does  not  abide  by\r\n\r\nthe  practice of parliamentary democracy, then it would mean the  death  of\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy. From the debate up to now,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwe  have only heard one of the Government Members - only one. I believe they  have\r\n\r\nreceived  many  criticisms and public attack. I believe they  will  one  day  be\r\n\r\njudged by the people and will be deemed to be guilty by the people. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  why do we want to amend the present clause 5? The purpose I think you will\r\n\r\nunderstand full well. Everyday you read the newspapers; the purpose is that  the\r\n\r\npresent P.A.P. Government's actions are more dictatorial and oppressive than the\r\n\r\ncolonial  government,  and they can do all sorts of improper  things.  They  can\r\n\r\ncreate a lot of unnecessary provisions and a lot of improper situations. That is\r\n\r\nwhy  before  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara orders  the  holding  of  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum,  we  ask that the Assembly should be informed  of  it  and  have  it\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  the Assembly. When we say that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  orders\r\n\r\nthe  holding  of  a  national referendum, we ask that  the  Assembly  should  be\r\n\r\ninformed of it and have it discussed in the Assembly. When we say that the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara orders the holding of a national referendum, it means that  it\r\n\r\nis  the Party in power which orders it. The Party in power, in the interests  of\r\n\r\nitself,  may,  on  the  question of such national importance,  hold  a  national\r\n\r\nreferendum when the people are not prepared. Is this democratic? The next  point\r\n\r\nperhaps is that the majority of the people of Singapore have already lost  their\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the P.A.P. because they are always dishonest and  distort  their\r\n\r\nviews.  The  present Government may, by means of the propaganda machinery  which\r\n\r\nthey  control,  publicise  what they want to say to  the  people  through  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Rediffusion. The Party in power can use all the machinery  which\r\n\r\nthey control to tell the people distorted things. At the same time, we know that\r\n\r\nwhen  a  government is in control of government machinery, it can resort to  its\r\n\r\npowers  to  suppress  freedom of expression. It can  also  suppress  the  Press,\r\n\r\nordering  the  latter not to publish any news detrimental to the Government.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, the Government can pass any law for anything formulated, and proposed\r\n\r\nby itself, and can prevent the people from holding protest meetings. That is why\r\n\r\nthey are so suspicious of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  also  because the Government has  acted  in  the  way  I  have\r\n\r\ndescribed. The Government is also very likely to do the same thing again.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know why we want to amend this clause - to ask the Assembly\r\n\r\nto request the Minister to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to order to hold  a\r\n\r\nnational  referendum. We know that in a democracy every law should be passed  by\r\n\r\nthe Legislature. Therefore, a matter of national importance should be passed  by\r\n\r\nthe Legislative Assembly and let the Minister be requested by the Legislative As\r\n\r\nsembly  before  he  advises the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. On matters  of  national\r\n\r\nimportance, if such matters are discussed in the Assembly, then the people  will\r\n\r\nbe better able to understand the matters and they can know better the situation.\r\n\r\nOnly  in  this  way  will  it comply with parliamentary democracy.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will not put on the cloak of parliamentary democracy and at the  same\r\n\r\ntime destroy it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, so much heat has been generated over something so innocuous  which\r\n\r\nneed  not  even  be debated at all.

Why has there been so much\r\n\r\nirrelevant  talk  on  a clause that is nothing - that does not introduce  anything\r\n\r\nnew?  It  is  just a constitutional practice and procedure. It  is  because  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  has  no more faith in the Government. Anything that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwants to do is treated with doubt and suspicion - and the Opposition, particularly\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan, the excomrades of the P.A.P. want to do all they can to expose and\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. to  counter-expose.

All I can say is that I forgive them, for they know  not  what\r\n\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to the Member for Anson, a person who is very well known as a\r\n\r\ntop lawyer in Singapore and who knows a lot about constitutions - for him to stand\r\n\r\nup and give a very lengthy talk in moving his motion and had to be checked on  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  occasions on points of order, is something I find  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nforgive.  He  quite rightly brought out constitutional practice. \"Look  at  this\r\n\r\nlaw,\"  he  said, \"any law before it can become law, has to be on the advice  and\r\n\r\nwith  the  consent  of the Assembly.\" That is constitutional practice.  That  is\r\n\r\nconstitutional  procedure. So, in the same way, when  the  Government  wants  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out any kind of act under any law, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has  to  do\r\n\r\nit.  He  does  it on the advice of the Government, never on the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly. The Legislative Assembly is there to  see  that  any  law\r\n\r\npassed,  or laws that are democratic, or laws that give unreasonable  powers  to\r\n\r\nthe Government, the Legislature, especially the Opposition, will keep a watchful\r\n\r\neye  on  any  acts of the Government in the administration of the  laws.  I  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the Barisan Sosialis are so strong on this. All their  speeches\r\n\r\nhave  been on the questions, not on whether or not a referendum has to be  held.\r\n\r\nNow,  whether  or  not  the  referendum  has  to  be  held,  the  constitutional\r\n\r\narrangements with the Federation have already been dc-bated in this Assembly  on\r\n\r\nthe  motion introduced by the Member for Anson himself. It has been accepted  by\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  that a referendum must be held to ascertain  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  as  to  whether  or not there should be closer  political  and  economic\r\n\r\nassociations with the Federation of Malaya. And on the matter of merger  itself,\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  had 2 days of it, if I remember rightly, with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown speaking for 7\ufffd hours - he is still the champion speaker, Sir. No  one\r\n\r\nhas  yet  tried  to  outdo what he has done. So, what is all  this  talk  about?\r\n\r\n\"Matters\", \"questions\", what is all this about? The Minister, in reply to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncharges  levelled  by  Members of the Opposition, has said  just  now  that  the\r\n\r\nquestions will be debated in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Member for Upper Serangoon said that this amendment does not make\r\n\r\nmuch difference. What he was aiming at were the questions to be posed and if the\r\n\r\nOpposition  are assured that the questions to be posed will be fully debated  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  there should be an end to this unnecessary  debate.  The  funny\r\n\r\nthing  is  this - the Member for Queenstown says, \"If we let it go like  that,  it\r\n\r\nwill just enable the Government to have a snap referendum.\" A snap referendum on\r\n\r\nwhat - whether  or  not  the  Barisan Sosialis should  be  banned?  What  sort  of\r\n\r\nreferendum can there be? Merger is the only referendum that is before the  House\r\n\r\nand  before  the  public,  and  everyone knows that  there  is  going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nreferendum. How \"snappier\" can it be? Then we must pass this law as  quickly  as\r\n\r\nwe  can  with  all  the  proper  safeguards to see  that  the  undemocratic  and\r\n\r\nunreasonable provisions are removed so that we will know sooner the views of the\r\n\r\nelectorate  as to whether or not the people of Singapore want closer association\r\n\r\nwith the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope with the assurance given by the Minister that the questions to be\r\n\r\nposed in the referendum - in any referendum - will be brought before this House  for\r\n\r\nopen, frank and full debate, this should put an end to this unnecessary exchange\r\n\r\nof words that are bringing us nowhere other than telling the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  there has been this vendetta that is not only fought out in public but  is\r\n\r\nalso  fought  out in this august Chamber. Let us put an end to this  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nvery  surprised that there should have been such a long debate on a very  simple\r\n\r\nconstitutional point. The question is whether legally and constitutionally,  the\r\n\r\nHead of State can be advised by a Minister who receives a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nrequest  from the Legislative Assembly. That is the question. Now, in  all  coun\r\n\r\ntries  which have adopted the British parliamentary system of government, it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  in  legislation that the Head of State can do certain executive  acts,\r\n\r\nand  when he does them, he must act on the advice of the Government. That is the\r\n\r\nconstitutional principle everywhere, and it is so in Singapore.  I  would  refer\r\n\r\nthe  Assembly to section 20 (2) of the Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council\r\n\r\nwhich provides that the Cabinet shall have the general direction and control  of\r\n\r\nthe  government of Singapore and shall be collectively responsible therefore  to\r\n\r\nthe Assembly.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the Ministers who form the Cabinet are each one, separately\r\n\r\nand  collectively, responsible for the advice which they give  to  the  Head  of\r\n\r\nState.  They  are responsible to this Legislative Assembly for the advice  which\r\n\r\nthey  give to the Head of State. That is the constitutional principle, known  as\r\n\r\nthe doctrine of ministerial responsibility. That is the doctrine which is at the\r\n\r\nroot  of  democratic  government and we will be abdicating  our  position  as  a\r\n\r\nGovernment it we knowingly agreed in this Legislative Assembly to the suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  the  Head of State should be compelled to act en the advice  of  a  single\r\n\r\nMinister  who  receives  a request from this Legislative  Assembly.  That  is  a\r\n\r\nnonsensical proposition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, I would say that the Member for Thomson is a very acute\r\n\r\nminded  person. In all these matters - even in legal problems - he has a mind  that\r\n\r\ncan see things in a far clearer and sharper light than the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the way the Member for Anson performed here just now? He held up a\r\n\r\ncopy  of  the  Referendum  Bill and shouted, \"Look  at  the  Singapore  National\r\n\r\nReferendum Bill. Look at the oreamble! What does it say? Be it enacted  by  the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara with the advice and consent of the Legislative  Assembly\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.'  Therefore, the Legislative Assembly can  advise  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara.\" But the Member for Thomson is a\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nperson  with a more acute mind. Mr Chairman, he referred us to the Trade  Union\r\n\r\nBill  and  he  said, \"There you are, look at what happened to  the  Trade  Union\r\n\r\nBill.\"  He then quoted me as saying in the Select Committee that the purpose  of\r\n\r\nall  this  is  to  ensure that the Head of State is net brought  into  political\r\n\r\ncontroversy. He did that to ridicule what I had said but he saw the  point,  Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir. He said, \"There you are, here is the case of the Head  of  State\r\n\r\nand  a  Bill.  We have enacted it, but the Government got hold  of  him  and  he\r\n\r\nwithdrew  his assent.\" He recognised the position. He could see the legal  point\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Member for Anson could not see, that even in the matter of assenting\r\n\r\nto  the Bill, the Head of State must, under the Constitution, take the advice of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the debate might go on for hours and hours. We are debating\r\n\r\nwith people who have a scant knowledge of constitutional law, but in accord with\r\n\r\ndemocratic  practice,  we  are  quite prepared  to  sit  here  till  12  o'clock\r\n\r\nconsidering  this clause. It is our duty to sit here and listen  attentively  to\r\n\r\neach  and everyone of them, to the gems of ignorance that flow from their  lips,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it did appear just now when the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill was speaking that he was, in fact, speaking for the Government.

However, Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill is of no consequence to the political situation in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nI am not in the least interested in him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Then why bring it up?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, up to now, the Minister for Finance has kept quiet.

The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs was, in fact, putting forward the same argument that  he  had\r\n\r\nadvanced  in  Select Committee. If I were to reply him once again,  I  would  be\r\n\r\nrepeating  all  the things that I had said earlier. Therefore, Sir,  I  have  no\r\n\r\nintention of replying to his statement point by point. But I do briefly want  to\r\n\r\nsum up the position, Sir. He said that it was a procedure clause and that it was\r\n\r\npractised in all democratic countries. Sir, I am not a lawyer. I do not know the\r\n\r\nfiner points of law. But the Member for Anson, I believe, has quoted a number of\r\n\r\nexamples in Select Committee and I think he did quote countries like the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nUnited  States  and  New Zealand where the question put to  the  referendum  was\r\n\r\ndiscussed and debated by the Legislature.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a basic principle is at stake. What we want to ensure is that there is a\r\n\r\ndebate  in this House on any matter referred for a referendum to the people.  It\r\n\r\nis  no  use  telling  us  that the merger issue has already  been  debated  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  there  is no need to accept this solution, because the  Government's\r\n\r\nargument so far has been that this is a general Referendum Bill. Although  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  seriously  believe  them,  it may be well be  that  they  want  to  hold  a\r\n\r\nreferendum to decide whether one should smoke a pipe or want to smoke a  cigar,\r\n\r\nas has already been debated in Select Committee. If the Government is serious in\r\n\r\nsaying that this is a general Referendum Bill, then naturally it is necessary to\r\n\r\nhave  such an amendment. Sir, in our minds, the arguments are quite simple  and\r\n\r\nclear.  It  appears  to us that it is necessary to have this amendment  to  this\r\n\r\nparticular  clause in order to ensure that there is a debate on any matter  that\r\n\r\nshould be referred to the people in a referendum. It appears to us that if  this\r\n\r\namendment  is  not  accepted, then the Government is not obliged  to  refer  any\r\n\r\nmatter to this Assembly first for a debate before it is to be put to the people.\r\n\r\nThat is a fundamental point that we wish to make.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, I am fascinated by the number of self-anointed\r\n\r\nexperts  on law in this Chamber. The Prime Minster is a self-anointed expert  on\r\n\r\njurisprudence;  the  Minister for Health and Law is a  self-anointed  expert  on\r\n\r\nconstitutional  law.  He  says  that  it is  the  constitutional  law  that  His\r\n\r\nExcellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara can only  act  on  the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, not the Minister, but the Government. Well, Sir, if he is  quibbling\r\n\r\nabout  the word, I can assure him that the Opposition would be very happy if  he\r\n\r\nwere to move an amendment and substitute the word \"Government\" for \"Minister\" in\r\n\r\nmy amendment. We\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould be quite content, it is not a matter of quibbling with us. The Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill, with round blue eyes, told us he could not understand what it was all\r\n\r\nabout, but he ended up by confessing that he knew what it was all about when  he\r\n\r\nasked  us  to accept the assurance of the Government that they would  allow  the\r\n\r\nAssembly to debate in future all matters before they go to a referendum. Is that\r\n\r\nthe way to legislate for a country - to accept the assurance of the Government?  I\r\n\r\nam  not  saying  particularly the P.A.P. Government. I  am  merely  saying  that\r\n\r\ngovernments  come  and  go, and governments are notoriously  short-lived.  Their\r\n\r\nmemories  are  short - and  that is hardly the way to run the  country,  to  accept\r\n\r\nassurances  for  the  future  from  the Government  to  the  effect  that  those\r\n\r\nsafeguards will be complied with, as they could be so easily incorporated in the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes I am equally\r\n\r\nsurprised  at  the  Member for Cairnhill but for different reasons,  that  there\r\n\r\nshould be this lengthy debate.

When  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants  to enact new laws, it must come to the Legislative  Assembly.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  if the Government could run the country without  money  and\r\n\r\nwithout  changing the laws of the country during its period of office, it  could\r\n\r\nvery  well  govern the country constitutionally without calling Parliament,  but\r\n\r\nthe difficulty in modem governments is this: governing a country is so expensive\r\n\r\nthat they must come to Parliament and therefore every year and from time to time\r\n\r\ngovernments  are forced to convene the Assembly, or the House of Representatives\r\n\r\nas  the case may be. It would still be parliamentary democracy if the Government\r\n\r\ncontinues to rule without enacting new laws and without coming to Parliament for\r\n\r\nmonies. If they continue to rule the country like that, I think we all would  be\r\n\r\nvery happy and praise the Government and might even possibly vote them in again,\r\n\r\neven though they do not call the House every month.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the constitutional responsibility of the Head of State in a\r\n\r\nparliamentary democracy, as I see it, is to accept the advice of his  Ministers.\r\n\r\nNow,  the responsibility of giving good advice to the Head of State is  that  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers,  and the responsibility of the Ministers is to  the  House.  The\r\n\r\nNegara or the Head of State as the case may be, is not responsible to the  House\r\n\r\nfor any of the acts he performs. Now, he can only perform acts on the advice  of\r\n\r\nhis  Ministers. If he does anything wrong, it is the Ministers who take the  rap\r\n\r\nfor  it,  as  they  are  responsible to the Assembly, or  the  House  of  Representatives as the case may be. The constitutional practice therefore is that the\r\n\r\nNegara or the Head of State can only act on the advice of his Ministers, and his\r\n\r\nMinisters are responsible to the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHouse. If  he gives wrong advice, the Government is chastised. If it loses  the\r\n\r\nconfidence of the House, it resigns.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not yet seen any law - and I am here\r\n\r\nsubject to correction by the Member for  Anson or any ether Member, and if they wish\r\n\r\nto cite authorities  to  me,  I shall be very pleased to listen to it - which says that\r\n\r\na Head of State shall  act on  the  advice of the Ministers at the instigation of the\r\n\r\nAssembly. I have  not yet  seen  any section in any particular Ordinance which says that.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for  Anson,  in  substantiation  of his claim, did  cite  the  preamble  to\r\n\r\ntwo Ordinances wherein it is said, \r\n\r\n\"Be it enacted by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara with the  advice and consent of the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly of Singapore, as follows:-\". By  that  he  intended to convey\r\n\r\nto the Assembly that the Negara acts  with  the advice  of  the Assembly.\r\n\r\nI beg to submit, with great respect to the Member  for Anson, that that is not the\r\n\r\ncorrect position. It is merely a form of words,  Mr Speaker, Sir, which is used in\r\n\r\nOrdinances and which is necessitated by our Order in  Council. Mr Speaker, Sir, if\r\n\r\nyou will be good enough to look at Part VI  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Order  in  Council. \"Powers and  procedure  of  the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly\" under the marginal note \"Power to make laws\" it says this:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Subject to the provisions of this Order, it shall be lawful for the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, with the advice and consent of the Assembly, to make laws for\r\n\r\nthe peace, order\r\n\r\nand good government of Singapore.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will note that in the Constitution, the person who can\r\n\r\nmake  laws is the Negara and not the Assembly. It shall be lawful for the  Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara . . . to make laws for the peace, order and good government of\r\n\r\nSingapore'  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Assembly.  That   is   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional form. But nobody in their senses contends that it is  the  Negara\r\n\r\nwho  makes the laws of Singapore, it is this Assembly that makes laws  and  when\r\n\r\nBills  have had their Third Reading, it goes up to the Negara, and on the advice\r\n\r\nof the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nappropriate Minister, he assents to them when they become law.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do suggest, with great respect to the Member for Anson, that the words in\r\n\r\nthe  preamble  to  our  Ordinances are necessitated by section  47  of  the  Constitution \r\n\r\nto comply with the constitutional provisions of the Order in  Council.\r\n\r\nSo  when the Member for Anson quotes them as something substantiating his  point\r\n\r\nof  view,  I  find myself unable to accept it, because I think that is  not  the\r\n\r\ncorrect constitutional position.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the other aspects raised by Members of the Barisan Sosialis particularly, their political objection to this clause They say, firstly, that the\r\n\r\nGovernment might spring the merger issue on them unexpectedly. Mr Speaker. Sir,\r\n\r\nwe  have  debated merger and everything connected with merger ad nausea,  and  I\r\n\r\ntell my friends in the Barisan Sosialis that the people in Singapore are fed up\r\n\r\nto  the teeth with reading about merger, hearing about merger. They are sick  to\r\n\r\ndeath  of  it. And if the Barisan think by consuming the Assembly time  for  the\r\n\r\nlast four hours, they are going to get more reading space in the papers and more\r\n\r\nradio time, I tell them this - that when the people see the- papers reporting  any\r\n\r\nthing  connected with the merger they turn quickly to something  else.  That  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening today in Singapore, because we are making much too  much  of\r\n\r\nthis.  It  is a national issue, of course, hut tiresome repetition. Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\nSir, does not make the issue any more important.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point the Barisan make is that the merger issue might be forced on\r\n\r\nthe public without the Assembly being made aware of it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the Member for Anson who moved a motion to the effect that a\r\n\r\nreferendum  on the merger should be held, and with an amendment the  motion  was\r\n\r\naccepted.  Sir,  the two points which have been made, that the issue  of  merger\r\n\r\nmight be put without\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndebate in the House, cannot be sustained. That a referendum might not be held on\r\n\r\nthe  merger  cannot  be sustained, because these two issues  have  already  been\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in the Assembly and settled. I think debate which we have had  should\r\n\r\nnot have been on clause  5 of this Bill, but it should have been on clause 13. I think  all  the\r\n\r\narguments  advanced become quite relevant and quite pertinent  and  sensible  if\r\n\r\nthey are advocated in relation to clause 13. But in relation to clause 5, I  say\r\n\r\nthey do not make sense.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Farrer Park obviously hopes to become a Minister of the P.A.P., because  he\r\n\r\nis  speaking for the P.A.P. and riot speaking for anybody else. It is not a case of  our  trying  to get more radio time. The mere fact that the  Assembly  sits\r\n\r\nuntil  12  o'clock every night shows the intentions behind the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nmove. They cannot possibly cut out publicity on the debate, but they want also to limit the possibility of our\r\n\r\ndebate material getting in  time for the newspapers the next day. And you  know,\r\n\r\nSir, it is a very important issue. Everybody has eyes on the Referendum Bill and\r\n\r\nit  is  going to be a test as to whether or not we in Singapore will be given  a\r\n\r\nchance to say No in a peaceful and constitutional manner.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

Everytime we\r\n\r\npin them down on arguments, everytime they are cornered, everytime they have no\r\n\r\narguments to put forward, they say this is a general Referendum Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are trying to get across to the Government is this: do you agree to the\r\n\r\nprinciple that the matter or issue should first be debated in the Assembly?  Let\r\n\r\nme quote to you, Sir, the Minister for Finance in column 87* - he has been blaming\r\n\r\nme for belabouring the point. He said,\". . . we will concede to him straightaway\r\n\r\n. . .  that  there should be free, full and frank discussion of any  issue  of\r\n\r\nnational  importance\". And then further on he said, \"the subject of a referendum\r\n\r\nwhich we are going to hold very soon\" - implying merger. There was already free, full and frank discussion.  Again,\r\n\r\nin  column 88, the second paragraph, which has already been quoted by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Official Report of Select Committee on Singapore National Referendum Bill No. 3\r\n\r\ndated 8th May, 1962.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance again explained, \"Now, no government in Its senses is going to have a referendum on a matter which is not of national importance. Any matter of national importance must be debated in the Assembly, it is the natural course of events.\" Let us see what he said about this. In columns 91 and 92 the\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson asked, after all his arguments had been put forward,  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  admitted the legality and the strength of  our  arguments,  he\r\n\r\ncould  not  understand why - that is in column 92, Sir, - in accepting the principle\r\n\r\nthe Government nevertheless rejected the amendment. They had already agreed  to\r\n\r\nthe principle, Sir,If the wording is not correct, let them amend the wording to\r\n\r\nmake it correct. But male sure that the principle that there should be full  discussion  in the Assembly be accepted, in column 103 at the bottom, Sir, the  Min\r\n\r\nister for Finance said, \"If the accepted\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\npractice by any government is to give the Opposition full opportunity to  debate\r\n\r\nin  the Assembly, then it is quite unnecessary to embody it in any law.\" And  he\r\n\r\nfurther  added,  \"I do not see any necessity at all. You might  as  well  embody\r\n\r\nthose very obvious practices which are carried out by all Governments.\" In other\r\n\r\nwords, he admits the principle, hut he simply does not want to write it down  in\r\n\r\nthe law. You can understand the meaning of what he is saying.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You admit it is necessary. You admit the principle of it, yet you do not want\r\n\r\nit in the law. Why? Simply because the whole intention, as I have said, Sir, was\r\n\r\nto  have a snap referendum. The P.A.P. wanted to got it done quickly without any\r\n\r\ndiscussion in the Assembly on that particular question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we possibly have exhausted all points unless the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance wishes to extend the debate for another half an hour.  Dr\r\n\r\nGoh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if it is the purpose of this amendment to ensure that\r\n\r\nfull  debate takes place on any question to be posed in the referendum,  then  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that they have tried to achieve their objective in a most  inept  and\r\n\r\nclumsy  way. If it is their real purpose to ensure that any question put to  the\r\n\r\nreferendum should be debated first in the Assembly, this is not the  way  to  do\r\n\r\nit. Because by asking that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, the Head of State, should\r\n\r\nact  on  the  advice  of  the Assembly, either directly on  the  advice  of  the\r\n\r\nAssembly,  or  as the Assembly rules through a Minister, is wrong in  principle.\r\n\r\nThe Member for Farrer Park has given a most lucid, and, to me, a most convincing\r\n\r\naccount that it cannot be done in that way.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has given the constitutional position. May I give\r\n\r\nan  account  of  the  political reasons behind this amendment?  Sir,  you  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  the  debate  on merger, which was  to  be  the  subject  of  the\r\n\r\nreferendum, took place in November.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nIn  fact  the  first proposal that the Government would hold  a  referendum  on\r\n\r\nmerger  occurred  in September, I think, when the Member for  Queenstown  and  I\r\n\r\ndiscussed  this  matter over a radio forum. At that time the  Barisan  Sosialis.\r\n\r\nsomehow  or  other, came to the conclusion that we were going  to  have  a  snap\r\n\r\nreferendum on merger. What led them to this conclusion I do not know,  but  from\r\n\r\nSeptember  onwards  they turned all their guns on merger,  all  their  publicity\r\n\r\nweapons  were  deployed to the limit. And after sometime when they  kept  on  re\r\n\r\npeating  themselves, people found their arguments a shade not  only  ridiculous.\r\n\r\nbut  tiresome.  They  shot all their bolts by, I would say,  January,  February.\r\n\r\nthereabouts,  and there was no merger. So the purpose of this is  to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  on  the  timing of the referendum precise date they would not miscalculate\r\n\r\nagain.  Sir, why should we give them this particular advantage? Is the P.A.P. a\r\n\r\nphilanthropic  organisation? Is it our purpose to assist the Barisan  Sosialis?\r\n\r\nIt is not our slightest intention to do that. Let us be quite frank about it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back to the amendment itself. If that is what the Barisan Opposition really wants, that is, that the subject must be debated in the Assembly,\r\n\r\nthey have done it in a clumsy and constitutionally wrong way by this amendment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. is about to be drowned, the S.P.A. has throw-n\r\n\r\ndown a life buoy in order to save\r\n\r\nit.

And  that seems to me to be raised in the amendment to clause 18  by  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown. It seeks to add:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Every ballot paper shal1 be in the Form in the First Schedule to this\r\n\r\nOrdinance.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes in the First Schedule which indicates that his desire is that there\r\n\r\nshould be one question with an answer \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the first part of the amendment which urges that there should be only\r\n\r\none question - that is to be raised also in the amendment proposed in clause 13.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to clause 13 of the Member for An-son and the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  seeks in page A3, line 41, to leave out \"questions\" and insert  \"one\r\n\r\nquestion as framed by the Legislative Assembly\". That introduces the issue as to\r\n\r\nwhether  that  question should be framed' by the Legislative  Assembly.  On  the\r\n\r\nissue as to whether there should be a plain yes or no, this appears to be raised\r\n\r\nin  the  amendment by the Member for Anson in clause 20, where he seeks, whether\r\n\r\nthere  should be one question or more than one question, that there should still\r\n\r\nbe the request to the electors to say \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears to me to be convenient that the debate on this second amendment\r\n\r\nshould range over all those amendments I have mentioned, so that there will  be\r\n\r\nno  repetition  and time will certainly be saved. And when we reach  the  other\r\n\r\namendments which I have mentioned and arguments have already been exhausted  in\r\n\r\nrespect of any of them, then, of course, the Member who desires to take  a  vote\r\n\r\non  his amendment could propose the amendment for; a vote be taken. I trust that\r\n\r\nwould  be acceptable, as I think it would save the time of this Assembly  if  we\r\n\r\ncan take  all  these issues together. Whether there should  be  one  question,\r\n\r\nwhether  that question should be framed by the Legislative Assembly, and whether\r\n\r\nthe question should demand an answer \"yes\" or \"no\". The principle \"yes\" or \"no\"\r\n\r\nshould also apply if, in fact, there is more than one question.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sir, there are, in fact, three issues, as you have pointed out\r\n\r\nin  our amendments. I appreciate it is necessary that we should range over these\r\n\r\nissues which are in part covered by others, but the others, for example, require\r\n\r\nframing by the Legislative Assembly of the one question and others still require\r\n\r\na particular form of ballot\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npaper.  I would ask, Sir, in allowing us to range over these others, you  would\r\n\r\nnevertheless  grant us some indulgence when it comes to the specific  amendment,\r\n\r\nhowever brief it may be, to pinpoint those particular issues, Sir, and have them\r\n\r\nclarified  instead of leaving a thing inchoate with a great deal of argument  on\r\n\r\nall issues.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I have not indicated that. I have indicated that when we reach\r\n\r\nthe  other amendments which are mentioned, if it appears that the arguments have\r\n\r\nalready  been exhausted in respect of them, then it is up to the Member to  move\r\n\r\nsimpliciter if he so desires. But if the arguments have not been exhausted, and,\r\n\r\nas the Member for Anson suggests, and if Members wish to summarise the arguments\r\n\r\nin respect of those amendments, then I cannot stop them.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page A2, line 23, at end, to add-'(3) Not more than one question shall be\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the electors in any one referendum and such question shall  contain\r\n\r\nonly  one  issue and the electors shall only be required to answer such question\r\n\r\nin the simple affirmative or negative.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>As you have pointed out, Mr Chairman, there are, in fact, three matters in that\r\n\r\none single amendment. The first is not more than one question shall be submitted\r\n\r\nin a referendum. The second is that each question should contain only one issue,\r\n\r\nand it should not be double-headed. The third is that the people should have the\r\n\r\nright  to say yes or no. Mr Chairman, this amendment arises out of the  unhappy\r\n\r\nhistory  of  this Bill. Later I would crave your indulgence to refer to  certain\r\n\r\naspects of it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 16th of March, 1962, on the Second Reading of this Bill, at page 29 of\r\n\r\nthe  revised  transcript [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 3; col. 280], the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"This  Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the wish  of  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification of\r\n\r\nthe two territories.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we next heard the Deputy Prime Minister, on the 17th of April.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\non  my motion for a referendum on the merger issue, at page 8 [Hansard Vol.  17,\r\n\r\nNo. 8, col. 774]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nwith  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own\r\n\r\ninterest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation should be brought about.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, from those statements that this is a specific Referendum\r\n\r\nBill for the issue of merger. And then to make it quite certain an amendment was\r\n\r\nmoved  by  the  Deputy Prime Minister to my motion, and this was  the  operative\r\n\r\npart:  \"this  House  welcomes  the Government's introduction  of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum to ascertain the  wishes\r\n\r\nof  the  people  on  the  mode  and manner of the  inevitable  reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation of Malaya before arrangements are finalised . . .\".  Mr  Chairman, there are, in the plainest possible terms, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand the Deputy Prime Minister telling us that this is a specific Bill.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seeking to have the question formulated by the Assembly, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health and Law's reply at column 110 [Official Report of Select Committee on\r\n\r\nSingapore  National Referendum Bill No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]-midway-said,  \"My\r\n\r\npoint  here,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, is that this is a general referendum  Bill.  If\r\n\r\nthere  was before the Committee a Bill dealing with a specific referendum issue,\r\n\r\nthere is nothing to prevent the Legislative Assembly from deciding the questions\r\n\r\nto  be put to a referendum. But in this case, this is a general Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nand  certain executive acts are to be done by the Head of State.\" At column 118,\r\n\r\nthe same Minister, Sir, said this in a general referendum Bill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There might be various matters. One is the matter of smoking - whether the\r\n\r\npublic  should be allowed to smoke. The Member for Anson does not like  smoking.\r\n\r\nOne  day  we  might  hold a referendum on this. That is one  matter.  Merger  is\r\n\r\nanother matter. These matters involve all sorts of questions. For instance,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson does not like smoking but he might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagree  that  people should be allowed to continue pipe-smoking. A referendum  on\r\n\r\nsmoking  could  raise the following questions: Should smoking be prohibited,  or\r\n\r\nshould pipe-smoking or cigar-smoking be allowed?'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure you, Mr Chairman, I am not going to read all of them, but I do want\r\n\r\nto  show  you  how important it is now to pin this down to show you  that  quite\r\n\r\nshamelessly  and  blatantly in this Assembly they say one thing  and  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee they say another. There is no question of the blush of shame. There is\r\n\r\na  purely  an  interest in the power dynamics of the situation  which  does  not\r\n\r\ninclude, Sir, respect for logic or for the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if I might refer to column 138, the same Minister:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Member for Anson has moved an amendment that there shall be only one ques\r\n\r\ntion  on one issue. Mr Chairman, I have pointed out repeatedly that this  is  a\r\n\r\ngeneral Referendum Bill and there is a procedure in the Bill for the putting  of\r\n\r\nquestions. . . . Take the case of toddy shops. Questions could be:\r\n\r\n\"Should  toddy  shops be closed? Or should the sale of toddy to toddy  shops  be\r\n\r\nprohibited?\" There was the example of the Malay language: \"When should Malay  be\r\n\r\nthe official language?\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he goes on at column 140 to give you a few more questions that could be\r\n\r\nasked. Mr Chairman, we are in a quandary now. We are told by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister, by a solemn motion  passed  by  a  Government\r\n\r\nmajority  in this House, the motion saying that the purpose of the Bill  was  to\r\n\r\nhold  a  referendum  on merger, and we have had the Minister for  Finance  whose\r\n\r\ninterest  in finance went to the somewhat colloquial expression of, 'Let's  come\r\n\r\ndown to brass tacks. This Bill is for a referendum on merger.\" If you would like\r\n\r\na  reference,  Sir,  it is on the 11th May, at column 181  [Official  Report  of\r\n\r\nSelect Committee No. 4]. We have had a gentleman, the Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs, who on the 16th March in the revised  transcript\r\n\r\nat page 24 -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Member for Anson is beating about the bush.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ramming falsehoods down the throats of those who utter\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthem is painful, I know; I can understand it. Now, Sir, if you look at  the\r\n\r\nrevised  transcript of 16th of March at page 24 [Hansard  Vol.  17  No.  3,\r\n\r\ncol. 273]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan\r\n\r\nChee  Seng)  ha  Mandarin): Mr Speaker, Sir, today we  are  debating  the\r\n\r\nSingapore National Referendum Bill. This ought to be a simple and  meaningful\r\n\r\nBill.  Its  purpose is to reunite Singapore with  the  Federation  of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Now, Mr Speaker, in every instance - and  I shall be producing books; I am not talking off the cuff - where there\r\n\r\nhave  been specific Bills before ad hoc for specific issues for the purpose\r\n\r\nof  referring them to the people the issue has been specified in the  Bill;\r\n\r\nquestions  have  been  specified;  and you  will  find  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nambiguity. Here the right hand and the left had of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. not  only  do  not  agree, Sir, but  the  right  hand  sometimes\r\n\r\ndisagrees with itself, as does the left hand.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a vast number of references which I do not intend to deal with at\r\n\r\nthis  juncture; if provoked, I will. The purpose was to show you - and perhaps\r\n\r\nI  might  as  well  start with it now, Sir,If we are to believe  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  Deputy Prime Minister, the Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Health, and the Minister for Finance who,  of  course,  later\r\n\r\nchanged  his mind on the 11th of May, then this is a specific Bill to  deal\r\n\r\nwith the issue of merger.\r\n\r\nWhy  then are the questions not there? Should the questions be there,  Sir?\r\n\r\nLet  us ascertain. I would ask you to look at the Jamaican Ordinance,  Sir - I\r\n\r\nunderstand  you have a copy; and I have a photostat copy here, Sir - Ordinance\r\n\r\n53  of  1960. \"A law to provide for ascertainment by means of referendum  of\r\n\r\nthe opinion of the people of Jamaica\r\n\r\nwith  respect to the continued participation of Jamaica in the Federation of the\r\n\r\nWest  Indies.\" Sir, it provides, inter alia, that the date of the referendum\r\n\r\nshould  not be less than six weeks after the proclamation. It also  provides\r\n\r\nthe question:\r\n\r\n\"Should  Jamaica remain in the Federation of the West Indies?\" And the  electors  are  required  to  answer  \"yes\" or \"no\".  By  the  way,  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\ninteresting\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nto  notice  that  subsection (3) says that a majority of the people  voting  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  That  is  one.  They, on the other side, are  very  fond  of  liquor\r\n\r\nlicensing,  Sir. Let us take British Columbia. I do not know if you have  this;\r\n\r\nif  you have not, I will table it. \"British Columbia, Chapter 221, 1960, Liquor\r\n\r\nControl Plebiscites Act.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Lieutenant Governor-in-Council may from time to time submit to a vote of\r\n\r\nthe electors the following question on a ballot in the following form.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>and,  Sir (if I might show you, and I will table it), the question is there  on\r\n\r\nthe ballot paper:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Do you approve of the sale of beer by the glass in licensed premises without\r\n\r\na bar under Government control and regulation?'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>7.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  there  is  \"Yes\" with a square against it; there is  \"No\"  with  a  square\r\n\r\nagainst that.

I\r\n\r\nam  indebted to the Clerk of the Assembly for the Communication of the  17th  of\r\n\r\nMay  where  Members  will find this referred to, and if I  might  read  it,  Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  this  is from the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly  of  Western  Aus\r\n\r\ntralia about referendum procedure in Western Australia.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1932, there was great agitation within the State regarding seceding from\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth.  The  Parliament in that year passed  an  Act  authorising  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  to he held on the question [and you will notice again  the  question\r\n\r\nwas  formulated  by  Parliament] \"Are you in favour  of  the  State  of  Western\r\n\r\nAustralia withdrawing from the Federal Commonwealth established under the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nCommonwealth of Australia Constitution Act (Imperial)?\"'\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  bless  the Clerk of Western Australia, he even told us that the  voter  was\r\n\r\nrequired to vote \"Yes\" or \"No\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next one, Mr Chairman, as you are probably aware, is that in New Zealand\r\n\r\nthere  are no general referendum provisions. But provisions do exist that  are\r\n\r\nad  hoc,  and  in  each piece of legislation with reference to a  referendum  in\r\n\r\nrespect of a specific issue the questions are framed by Parliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada there was the Dominion Plebiscite Act. This is to be found in an\r\n\r\nannexe - annexe  2 - which we received from the Clerk of the  House.  It  was  a\r\n\r\nmemorandum  prepared by Dr Morose Olivier, Parliamentary Council of Canada.  It\r\n\r\ntells us that in 1942 there was a Dominion Plebiscite Act wherein was formulated the following question for the decision of the people of Canada:\r\n\r\nAre you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligation arising out of\r\n\r\nany  past  commitments  restricting the methods  of  raising  men  for  military\r\n\r\nservice?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annexe 1, which is supplied by the Clerk of the Assembly, being a document\r\n\r\nprepared  by  Mr  C.  D.  Combe  of the House of Assembly  of  Adelaide,  South\r\n\r\nAustralia,  will  inform us that there is no general law in South  Australia  to provide  for the taking of referenda. In the past, referenda had been  held  in\r\n\r\npursuance  of ad hoc legislation. I do ask, Mr Chairman, that it be appreciated\r\n\r\nthat  ad  hoc legislation means that in each instance the legislation directs  a\r\n\r\nspecific question for a specific issue.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us now come to the general referendum laws. Let us take Australia,\r\n\r\nwhich is close to us and a Dominion of the Commonwealth. I refer you to Volume\r\n\r\n4  of  the  Commonwealth Acts of Australia. At page 3565  is  to  be  found  the\r\n\r\nReferendum  Constitution  Alteration Act  1905-1936.  Now,  Section  5  of  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance  says  that  whenever \"a proposed law for the alteration  of  the  Con\r\n\r\nstitution is to be submitted to the electors, the Governor-General may  issue  a\r\n\r\nwrit for the submission of the proposed law. There is an authority to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe Governor-General \"On the role of Parliament\" that the Member for Farrer Park\r\n\r\nis  perhaps looking for. But we will pass that. That matter is now finished. But\r\n\r\nI want him to notice that in each case the law is first passed by Parliament and\r\n\r\nthen  put  by the Governor-General. Now, what is the form in which he  puts  it?\r\n\r\nSir, the form is to be found in Section 14 (A) (1) . Here it says that the ballot\r\n\r\npapers  to be used for the purposes of the referendum may be in accordance  with\r\n\r\nForm  C in the Schedule. The Schedule is to be found in page 3585. Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nif I might draw your attention to\r\n\r\nit.  I  would be happy to table it. The question is: \"Do you approve of the  pro\r\n\r\nposed law for the alteration of the Constitution intituled? [Here is set out the\r\n\r\ntitle of the proposed law.]\" There is a square for 'Yes' and a square for 'No'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in fairness, Mr Chairman, I would not like to omit mentioning that there\r\n\r\nis  also Section 14 (A) (3) , which says that if two or more referenda are  held\r\n\r\non the same day, it shall not be necessary for the forms of the ballot paper for\r\n\r\neach  referendum to be on a separate piece of paper, but two or  more  forms  of\r\n\r\nballot  paper which may be used by any one elector may be on one piece of  paper  in accordance with Form D in the Schedule. Form D, Mr Chairman, is on  the\r\n\r\nsame  page 3585. There it has: \"(1) Do you approve of the proposed law  for  the\r\n\r\nalteration  of  the Constitution intituled [here is set out the title]\"  with  a\r\n\r\nsquare  for  'Yes'  and  a square for 'No'. Then, \"(2) Do  you  approve  of  the\r\n\r\nproposed law for the alteration of the Constitution intituled, [here is set  out\r\n\r\nthe title]\" with another square for 'Yes' and a square for 'No'. You will notice\r\n\r\nthat  the  questions  proposed are carefully put because  the  Legislatures  are\r\n\r\nconscious  of the capacity not merely of a Machiavellian mentality but  even  of\r\n\r\nnormal  crooks to phrase questions which are so dishonest that no  honest  reply\r\n\r\ncan be adduced.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have not finished. I would now refer you to Switzerland, which is per\r\n\r\nhaps  the  home of the finest form of democracy barring one matter  the  curious\r\n\r\nblind side that - whatever our views are as regards that particular\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\naspect - it  should not blind us to the fact that they -have achieved the  highest\r\n\r\nform of expression of the democratic process in any country in the world. Let me\r\n\r\nrefer  first to the blind side, and that is they will not allow women  to  vote.\r\n\r\nThey say that we vote so often, we have to vote probably every other Sunday;  if\r\n\r\nwomen  vote  nobody is going to cook the Sunday joint. But that is neither  here\r\n\r\nnor  there.  I  ask  you  to  note this Article 120 of the  Swiss  Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Article  120 - when one section of the Federal Assembly passes  a  resolution,\r\n\r\nthat  there be a total revision of the constitution, and the other section  does\r\n\r\nnot  assent  to it; or when 50,000 Swiss citizens entitled to vote demand  total\r\n\r\nrevision,  then the question of whether there should be such revision shall,  in\r\n\r\nthe  one case as in the other, be submitted to a vote of the Swiss people by aye\r\n\r\nor  no.\" You have a law which introduces the regulations under that Article  120\r\n\r\nand it is known as the Law of 1892. In Article 11 of that law, where the Federal\r\n\r\nAssembly  formulates the separate proposal distinct from the proposal formulated\r\n\r\nby  popular  initiative  the following two questions  should  be  submitted  for\r\n\r\nvoting:  \"Do  you accept the popular initiative proposal, or do you  accept  the\r\n\r\nproposal formulated by the Federal Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here, thanks to the Swiss Representative in Singapore, the actual form of ballot paper in Switzerland, and I shall submit it to you. This one says: \"Do you accept the initiative concerning the protection\r\n\r\nof the consumers, or do you accept the counter proposal of the Federal Assembly?\r\n\r\nReply 'Yes' or 'No'. Those who reply 'Yes' to the two questions will be void.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, having traced what others do, let us come back to the main purposes of my amendment. I ask that there should be not more than one question. Let us step there for a moment, Mr Chairman. Why did I say that? Because we have been assured, Mr Chairman, however much we have reason to doubt assurances\r\n\r\ngiven by this Government: nevertheless I read to you\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe  formal  assurances of the Prime Minister, the Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs, and the Minister for Finance that this Bill is a Bill\r\n\r\nfor  a  referendum  in  respect of the proposed closer  relationship  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how many questions have been debated, connected with those proposals?\r\n\r\nTwo. Which are they? The first one is the White Paper proposals in Command 33 of\r\n\r\n1961 which were passed by the Assembly by a majority of 33, with 18 walking out,\r\n\r\nif you will remember.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can you remember the other question? There have been so many millions of\r\n\r\nwords  by the P.A.P. Government and their machines to confuse the issue  that  I\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  surprised if most people in Singapore have forgotten  the  other\r\n\r\nquestion,  and I ask your indulgence to refer to it. I have in mind,  Mr  Chair\r\n\r\nman,  the Hansard of the 21st of November, 1961. I would be grateful if I  could\r\n\r\nhave that for a moment. Can I borrow it, Sir?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A copy of the Hansard was handed over to Mr Marshall.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we are, Sir. At column 406. You remember, the Minister for Labour moved\r\n\r\nwhat was called the merger motion:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That, whereas it has always been the avowed objective of all nationalists of\r\n\r\nMalaya  to achiievc the reunification of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya\r\n\r\nand to remove the artificial division created by the British by their policy  of\r\n\r\n\"divide  and rule\", this House affirms and declares that the first objective  of\r\n\r\nall  true  patriots  of  Malaya is to achieve the  reunification  of  these  two\r\n\r\nterritories in a merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Member  for  Qucenstown then moved to delete the  words  \"in  a  merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Melaya\" and to substitute \"in a genuine  merger\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  with  the  Federation  of Malaya,  with  Singapore  entering  the\r\n\r\nFederation as the twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming\r\n\r\nFederal  Citizens on Merger Day'. So, that was the second aspect of merger  that\r\n\r\nwas debated - the White Paper and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthe Opposition view which was expressed in this amendment, \"a genuine merger  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  with the federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering the Federation\r\n\r\nas  the  twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming  Federal\r\n\r\nCitizens on Merger Day\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remember, Mr Chairman, when brickbats start flying about asking for\r\n\r\npie  in  the sky, that these terms are terms that were offered by the Federation\r\n\r\nto the State of Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak. That was our stand and after, as you\r\n\r\nremember, the marathon debate, the Government with its allies on the Front bench\r\n\r\nof the Opposition defeated that amendment. Therefore, the question of \"a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya, with Singapore entering  the\r\n\r\nFederation as the twelfth state and with all its Citizens automatically becoming\r\n\r\nFederal Citizens on Merger Day\" was rejected by this Assembly in the name of the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, the position then is that there is but one question and one question which has been approved by this Assembly, and that question is whether the Assembly approves Command Paper 33 of 1961 which the P.A.P. call merger. If I might for a moment, Mr Chairman, entertain you with another bed-time story of\r\n\r\nthe  way  the P.A.P. work. I have discovered where they get their technique.  It\r\n\r\nseems  a long, long time ago, Mr Chairman, there was an emperor of China called\r\n\r\nCh'n  Shih Wang. Some 2,200 years ago, do not take me in respect of the accuracy\r\n\r\nof  the  date. He was a great emperor, Mr Chairman. He built the Great Wall  of\r\n\r\nChina.  He unified all the provinces of China and he left a peaceful, great  and\r\n\r\nprosperous country to his son. His son being young and inexperienced  trusted  a\r\n\r\nfriend  of  his whom he made Prime Minister. He trusted his Prime Minister  like\r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore trusted the gentleman who leads the Government  front\r\n\r\nbench.  He  trusted  him.  They trusted him. These are  the  trusted  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and this Prime Minister slowly worked himself into position until  one\r\n\r\nday he felt strong enough to challenge the power of the emperor and so he got  a\r\n\r\ndeer  from  the  forest and brought it into the imperial palace and  before  the\r\n\r\nimperial's presence, he said \"Sire, is not that a beautiful horse?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nThe  king said. \"Do not be a fool. That is not a horse. That is a deer.\" And the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister said, \"Sire, ask your courtiers.\" It is like the P.A.P. saying.\r\n\r\n\"Ask  the Assembly. Is this not merger?\" And the courtiers, who knew well  where\r\n\r\ntheir  bread  was  buttered and who it was that put them in their  offices,  all\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Sire,  that is a beautiful horse.\" Let us go back. We in  this  Assembly\r\n\r\nhave said that these proposals are merger proposals. Mr Chairman, the point is:\r\n\r\nwhy  one  question?  One question because that is the only  question  which  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  has approved. That question - that Command Paper 33 of 1951 is good  for\r\n\r\nSingapore;  and  it  is right and proper that that question  should  go  to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  though,  as  the Member for Farrer Park has informed  you,  we  in  the\r\n\r\nWorkers'  Party  are  genuinely in doubt as to the  long  term  value  of  these\r\n\r\nprovisions  and, in fact, hear that in the long view they would be adverse  both\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation and to ourselves. Nevertheless, we would struggle as we  are\r\n\r\nstruggling today for the right of those who want those \"merger proposals\" as the\r\n\r\nPAP, calls them, \"P.A.P. proposals\" if we may, for simplicity. I would fight for\r\n\r\ntheir  right to say \"yes\" to those proposals though I think that they are wrong.\r\n\r\nAnd,  I  say. Sir, surely elementary decency requires that those who  themselves\r\n\r\nwould like to say \"yes\" should recognize the riqht of those who disagree to  say\r\n\r\n\"no\".  You remember Voltaire's famous dictum \"I do not agree with what  you  say\r\n\r\nbut I will fight to the death for your right to say it.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Chairman, shou1d there be another question posed? We of the Workers'\r\n\r\nParty are not fooled by the Government's alleged generous democratic inspiration\r\n\r\nand  motivation  in wanting to put the Opposition point of view.  If  they  have\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"We want to put your point of view as enunciated in the amendment to  the\r\n\r\nmotion which you formerly moved,\" then we would say, \"Yes, put it as a question\r\n\r\nif  you  like, but the people should be entitled to say \"'We do not  want  this\r\n\r\neither.'\" You should not force the people, however\"' well-meaning you  are,  any\r\n\r\nmore than to force a daughter you love to marry either A or B. That is not the\r\n\r\nchoice at\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nall  because the one may be totally unacceptable as in this case and  the  other\r\n\r\nmay  be  a question for very grave misgivings. But it is not an honest approach.\r\n\r\nas indicated, that they intend to put forward. It is not the Opposition point of\r\n\r\nview as enunciated in column 406 of Hansard of the 21st of November, 1961, where\r\n\r\nwe  asked for a genuine and complete merger with Singapore entering as the  12th\r\n\r\nState  and  with automatic conversion of citizenship. That is not what  hey  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to put. They say that the Opposition want a Penang and Malacca type.  You\r\n\r\nknow  it  is  a  curious  thing; I have in the past heard about  this  Goebbels'\r\n\r\ntechnique. I was old enough to read about it when Goebbels was alive.  He  said,\r\n\r\n'If a lie is big enough, repeated often enough and loud enough, some people will\r\n\r\nbelieve  it.'  But  I  can see it working. I can see it working  amongst  honest\r\n\r\npeople  and there are honest people who believe that Opposition Members  want  a\r\n\r\nform  of  merger  whereby  a  major part of our people  are  deprived  of  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the radio forum the Prime Minister agreed that, in fact, that was not correct. On the 11th of June, Mr Jek, another P.A.P. gentleman, earning a\r\n\r\nlucrative income by his political activities, said over Radio P.A.P. that it  is\r\n\r\nthe Communists who want a Penang and Malacca type of merger. Well, Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nif  it is the Communists who want a Penang and Malacca type, what have we to  do\r\n\r\nwith  this?  Are  we  running Singapore for the Communists?  Are  we  holding  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  for  the  Communists,  or are we  going  to  hold  a  referendum  in\r\n\r\nconformity  with the recognised principle of decency and, that is,  to  put  the\r\n\r\nissue  clearly to the people whereby they can have an opportunity to  accept  or\r\n\r\nreject it as was alleged by the Prime Minister. Now, Mr Chairman, you say to me\r\n\r\nthat  if the people do not want this Penang/Malacca type as you say why  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment offering this as an alternative? Yes, Mr Chairman, why? On the  face\r\n\r\nof it, it seems rather absurd, but if you know them, as I know them, if you have\r\n\r\nfollowed  their twisted and tortured reasonings you will realise that they  have\r\n\r\ncome to the position now\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwhere they are conscious of the possibility that a straightforward referendum on\r\n\r\nthe  issue - Do you accept White Paper, Command Paper 33 or not, may well bring  a\r\n\r\nmajority of our citizens against\r\n\r\nit.   Some  of  the  majority would be entitled to believe  that  if  this  were\r\n\r\nrejected,  the Federation must, in its own good sense, recognise that they  have\r\n\r\ngot  to offer us better terms and offer them quickly. But in the meanwhile  what\r\n\r\nhappens  to  the P.A.P., Mr Chairman? What happens to the Prime Minister?  What\r\n\r\nhappens  to  the Front Bench?

It is perhaps best to quote him in his own words. I refer you, Sir, to\r\n\r\nthe revised transcript of Hansard, 16th\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nMarch, 1962, page 32, first paragraph [Vol. 17 No. 3, col. 285]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Sir, if there was the slightest risk of merger being frustrated and the\r\n\r\ncountry plunged into disaster by the activities of the Communists manipulating a\r\n\r\nreferendum,  let  me  say that it would be criminal folly on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to hold a referendum and allow the future of Malaya and Malaysia  to\r\n\r\nbe  imperilled. If that were the position, if the risk existed, then, regardless\r\n\r\nof  what benefit the Member for Hong Lim or the Member for Anson may reap by the\r\n\r\nGovernment  having  to  carry the odium of living down the  Communist  smear  of\r\n\r\ntrying to sell out a Chinese Singapore to a Malay Federation, it would still  be\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  the  Government to go through with it to ensure that  the  peace,\r\n\r\nsecurity and happiness of the people, not just of Singapore but of Malaya and of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, are not jeopardised.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, those with knowledge of the P.A.P. dictionary will tell you\r\n\r\nthat  that means that if there was the slightest danger of this Government being\r\n\r\noverthrown, then that is the point at which democracy must end. It is  all  very\r\n\r\nwell to have democracy, but not a democracy where the P.A.P. are not the persons\r\n\r\nin  power.  How, Sir, is the Prime Minister to achieve this business  about  \"no\r\n\r\nrisk  that  the referendum should be lost\"? After all, there can be no question,\r\n\r\nbut  there  are  many people who are genuinely convinced that  the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  are inimical to our long-term future, just as there are many  people,\r\n\r\nSir,  who are honestly convinced that they are valuable for our future. How  are\r\n\r\nwe  to  prevent  the risk from eventuating, that those against the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals  would be more than those in favour? Quite simple, Sir - by  not  giving\r\n\r\nthem the chance to vote against the White Paper proposals. But how do you put  a\r\n\r\nreferendum  without  giving the people a chance to vote against  the  proposals?\r\n\r\nAgain,  Sir, you do that by not having the one question which was agreed  to  by\r\n\r\nthis  House,  but by having another question which was never debated,  something\r\n\r\nthat  nobody  wants-the Penang and Malacca type of merger which  the  Government\r\n\r\ninterprets  as  being  one  that  provides  for  341,000  people  losing   their\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  You put that question. Then what does it matter if there  are  two\r\n\r\nquestions  and  both are unpalatable, so long as one can answer  \"No\"  to  both?\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSir,  that is the question. They will not allow the people to say \"no\" to  both.\r\n\r\nThey  will not allow the people to say \"yes\" or \"no\". No - you strike out the  one\r\n\r\nyou  do  not  want.  Now,  that is fair enough to  those  who  want  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals.  But what about those who do not want it and who do not want  either,\r\n\r\nas  nobody wants these curious proposals which they propound such as the  Penang\r\n\r\nand  Malacca type of merger with 341,000 citizens losing their citizenship? \"Oh,\r\n\r\nwell, they'll have to lump it.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>9.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a curious petition, Sir, which I have received today from 39 cultural\r\n\r\nassociations and which refers to Hobson's choice. I shall come to that in a  few\r\n\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then, we are posed with this question: that the people have got to strike\r\n\r\nout  one  or the other. We in the Workers' Party recognising the unhappy dilemma\r\n\r\nwhere   decent  citizens  cannot  accept  in  good  conscience  either   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals - and  nobody  wants the Penang and Malacca type with  341,000  citizens\r\n\r\nlosing their citizenship - and not being able to choose from either, and not being\r\n\r\nable to strike out either but wanting to deface their ballot paper, we moved  an\r\n\r\namendment  that  that  should  be permissible.  This  was  seized  upon  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and now even a blank vote is no longer permissible, because  if  you\r\n\r\nstrike  out both or if you put a blank vote, that shall be deemed to be  a  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the  P.A.P. proposals. But that is the second instalment  of  this  tragic\r\n\r\nstory, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, what I want to draw your attention to is that in the amendment that I\r\n\r\nseek, I bring in the experience we have of the context, and that is, the context\r\n\r\nof  this  Bill  being allegedly a specific Bill for a referendum on  a  specific\r\n\r\nissue - , the  merger issue -  in respect of a specific position  that  there  were\r\n\r\nspecific proposals called White Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which was passed. That is\r\n\r\nthe  only  question that can legitimately be put. And the only way to  obtain  a\r\n\r\ndecision is to give the people a choice to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a radio forum on 12th June, the Minister for Finance used some curious\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nEnglish.  I do not suppose you have a transcript, Sir, but I can make  it  available - it is an official one. He said on page 5:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh says you must have a question with \"yes\" or \"no\" answer.\r\n\r\nThe answer is that this is a most utterly ridiculous proposition.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A  ridiculous  proposition. Mr Chairman, I think we  have  shown  earlier  this evening  that  in  some 12 democratic countries, including France,  Switzerland,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, Jamaica, British  Columbia,  West\r\n\r\nAustralia, every  one of their specific referenda required an answer - \"yes\"  or\r\n\r\n\"no\". Why do the Government resist so strenuously the right to the people to say\r\n\r\n\"yes\" or \"no\"? Let us grant them two questions that they insist on. Let us grant\r\n\r\nthem  a  million  questions that they insist on to confuse  the  people.  It  is\r\n\r\nbecause if you have the right to say \"yes\" or \"no\", Mr Chairman, then no matter\r\n\r\nhow  filthy the question, no matter how dishonest, disgraceful and indecent  the\r\n\r\nalternative, you can say \"no\" to each of them, and you may thereby  bring  about\r\n\r\nthe  fall  of  the  P.A.P. Government, which so strenuously  seeks  to  maintain\r\n\r\noffice,  which  considers that the welfare of the country is  equated  with  the\r\n\r\nwelfare of its Front Bench.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, on this issue with regard to the two questions. I had earlier sought to show you that the. Opposition Parties had made their stand clear from the 21st of November - and even earlier - that we wanted a genuine and complete merger, with Singapore coming in as the\r\n\r\ntwelfth  State  and  with our citizens becoming citizens of  the  Federation  on\r\n\r\nMerger Day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, I want to repeat that this is what has been offered by the\r\n\r\nFederation to Brunei, Borneo and Sarawak. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I have been wondering whether these detailed arguments\r\n\r\nare not in fact anticipating the Member for Anson's own motion where he suggests\r\n\r\nthat  there  should only be one question and that is connected  with  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper.  Of  course, there must be some overlapping. But I would suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson that a detailed debate on those lines could await the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndebate on his motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged for your guidance, Mr Chairman. I hope you\r\n\r\nappreciate  that I am seeking to put forward my reasons in the  context  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that this is supposed to be a Bill for a specific issue in accordance with\r\n\r\nthe  motion already passed, that in that specific issue the Prime Minister  and\r\n\r\nhis  henchmen  have, to their ill fortune, indicated the nature though  not  the\r\n\r\nwording  of  the questions. And the nature of the questions they have  indicated\r\n\r\nare  two  questions: Do you want the P.A.P. proposals or do you want Penang  and\r\n\r\nMalacca with loss of citizenship? So I have got to show why the one is right and\r\n\r\none alone is right in the context of my motion, and the other one is wrong. Sir.\r\n\r\nBut I do not wish to weary the House, and if you feel that enough has been said,\r\n\r\nSir, I shall stop at this juncture.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It has been moved as an amendment in page A2, line 23, at end,\r\n\r\nto add -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(3) Not more than one question shall be submitted to the electors in any one\r\n\r\nreferendurn  and  such question shall contain only one issue  and  the  electors\r\n\r\nshall  only  be  required to answer such question in the simple  affirmative  or\r\n\r\nnegative.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I have indicated that the debate could range over the second amendment to clause\r\n\r\n13,  that  is to say, In page A3, line 41, to leave out \"questions\"  and  insert\r\n\r\n\"one  question as framed by the Legislative Assembly\"; the amendment  to  clause\r\n\r\n18.

Statements\r\n\r\nhave  been  issued.  There have been forums on the matter, memoranda  have  been\r\n\r\nsubmitted and meetings of associations and political parties have been called to\r\n\r\ndiscuss this Bill. Mass meetings\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ntoo  have  been held and everybody in Singapore is wondering what the Government\r\n\r\nare  going to do. The Government have already given an indication that they will\r\n\r\npose  two  questions  to the people, and from what we have  learned,  these  two\r\n\r\nquestions will not be acceptable to the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that when this Bill was sent to Select Committee,\r\n\r\nviews  were  sought from various associations. It was thought  that  if  various\r\n\r\nassociations, organisations and individuals could submit their views on the Refe\r\n\r\nrendum  Bill to this Select Committee, these views might possibly influence  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  to  change the Government stand on the Referendum  Bill.  But\r\n\r\nwhile we were deliberating in Select Committee, the Prime Minister was in London\r\n\r\non  the 19th of May, telling the people in London that the referendum that would\r\n\r\nbe  carried out in Singapore would be on the mode and manner of merger. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  Sir,  even while we were deliberating as to whether we should  have  one\r\n\r\nquestion or two questions, the P.A.P. had already made up their minds. They  had\r\n\r\nalready decided to pose two unacceptable questions to the people. Otherwise  how\r\n\r\ncould  the  Prime  Minister have said those words at London  Airport?  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  all the memoranda that were submitted to the Select Committee could  not\r\n\r\ninfluence  the P.A.P. Ministers in any way. In fact all the memoranda  submitted\r\n\r\nto  the  Select Committee were treated just like wastepaper. It was  a  disgrace\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P.  Government  should so lightly  treat  public  opinion.  Their\r\n\r\nacceptance of Select Committee deliberations was merely an eyewash just to  give\r\n\r\nthe  impression that the P.A.P. would not mind accepting views from the  people.\r\n\r\nBut  in  actual fact, when these views were presented to the P.A.P., they  never\r\n\r\naccepted  those  views  in spite of the weight of logic and  argument  in  these\r\n\r\nmemoranda.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is this referendum? The Prime Minister has defined it in various\r\n\r\nways.  He  says that it is a means whereby the views of the people could  be  as\r\n\r\ncertained.  Examples have been quoted to you, Sir, by the Member for  Anson  and\r\n\r\nfrom the memoranda submitted to the Select Committee for our deliberations\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin  Select  Committee that a referendum is actually a means  whereby  the  Legis\r\n\r\nlative Assembly seeks the views of the people on a specific issue, -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mode and manner.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - motion, resolution or Bill or law that has been passed by\r\n\r\nthe  majority in the Legislative Assembly.

May I quote you\r\n\r\nalso  column 95 of the Official Report of the Select Committee on the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Referendum  Bill [No. 3 dated 8th May, 1962]? This  has  already  been\r\n\r\ntouched on by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin his speech, but I might as well repeat\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Mr David Marshall: Forgive me, Sir. The Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act,\r\n\r\n1906-36, section 3:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Referendum means the submission to the electors of a proposed law for the\r\n\r\nalteration of the Constitution.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whenever a proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution is to be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the electors, then the Governor in Council may issue a  writ  for\r\n\r\nsubmission.'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  proposed  law is one that has already been debated by both  Houses  of  the\r\n\r\nAustralian Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  it has been explained why the words \"Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh\" are very correct\r\n\r\nand  why  there should be only one question to be posed to the people. The  only\r\n\r\nway  for the electorate to endorse any decision already taken or adopted by  the\r\n\r\nLegislative  Assembly is for one question to be posed to them  that  requires  a\r\n\r\nsimple  answer  of  'yes' or 'no'. The answer comes back clear and  unequivocal,\r\n\r\n'yes' or 'no', and there is no doubt of the mind of the voter. Mr Marshall, the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson,  has  quoted a number of precedents of  referenda  in  other\r\n\r\ncountries  and he has pointed out that it is a law that has also been passed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative  Assembly. He has pointed cut, Sir, that the  question  too  is\r\n\r\nframed,  as  I have a little while ago also pointed out. He also quoted  Article\r\n\r\n120  in  the  Swiss  Constitution which sets out the procedure  where  only  one\r\n\r\nquestion is put to the electorate in the referendum and the answer required is a\r\n\r\nsimple  'yes'  or  'no',  all clearly showing that the  correct  translation  of\r\n\r\nreferendum is \"Chyuen Min Fu Chyueh\". It specifies that if there is going to be a\r\n\r\nreferendum, then it should be a referendum on a motion or resolution, a Bill  or\r\n\r\nlaw  that has been passed in the Legislative Assembly and that it must be  posed\r\n\r\nin one question to the people for their endorsement.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Paper Command No. 33 of 1961, has been passed by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nSimple  logic therefore tells us that if the P.A.P. are honest, these  proposals\r\n\r\nought to be put to the people of Singapore to see whether or not they approve of\r\n\r\nthem. They can be asked simply, \"Do you approve the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmerger  proposals as embodied in Paper Command No. 33 of 1961?\" The question  is\r\n\r\nneat  and  simple, and it comes back with an answer \"yes\" or \"no\". In this  way,\r\n\r\nyou can easily find out the views of the people on this important issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have boasted that the merger proposals have the popular support of\r\n\r\nthe  people and we feel that it is time they put it to the test. After all, the\r\n\r\ntest of the pudding is in the eating. Let them therefore put these proposals  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  if  the answer comes back with a 'yes', then  the  P.A.P. can\r\n\r\njustify  their claim that their merger proposals have the support of the people.\r\n\r\nBut  if  different questions are asked, and especially if the two questions  are\r\n\r\nunacceptable to the electorate, then they will be forced to cast uncertain votes\r\n\r\nor blank votes. Because if they cannot accept those two questions posed to them,\r\n\r\nthen  that  is the only way they can show their disgust and protest against  the\r\n\r\nquestions  put. Not only is it unfair to the voter but it also goes against  the\r\n\r\nstated  objective of the P.A.P. of finding out the views of the  people  on  any\r\n\r\nissue.  We  have  twice  debated in radio forums about democratic  practice.  If\r\n\r\nunacceptable questions are asked, one must have the right to say 'no'. But, now,\r\n\r\nwhat  has happened is that with the addition of clause 29, the voter is not even\r\n\r\nallowed  to say 'no'. He is denied the right to say 'no', because if  he  should\r\n\r\ncast  a blank vote, he is deemed to accept the decision o, the Assembly - that  is\r\n\r\nthe decision of the P.A.P. How are the P.A.P. going to claim that the true views\r\n\r\nof  the people will be ascertained? So to avoid all this, the only proper  thing\r\n\r\nis: pose one question on one issue to which a simple answer of 'yes' or 'no'  is\r\n\r\nrequired.  Only  then can we ascertain the views of the people on  any  specific\r\n\r\nissue.  The Member for Anson has quoted you precedents. I wish to refer  to  the\r\n\r\nConscription Referendum of 1916 in Australia. The people were asked one question\r\n\r\nand  they  were  asked to give the answer in a 'yes' or 'no'  form.  On  another\r\n\r\noccasion in 1917, they were again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nasked  to  indicate their views on conscription. On this occasion, one  question\r\n\r\nwas  posed  which required only a simple answer of \"yes\" or \"no\".  The  question\r\n\r\nposed was: \"Are you in favour of the proposal of the Commonwealth Government for\r\n\r\nreinforcing  the  Australian Forces overseas?\" I do not know, Sir, whether  the\r\n\r\nprecedent which I am quoting has already been quoted, but for the record, may  I\r\n\r\nrefer  you  to  column 115 of the same Official Report, where Mr  Byrne  talked\r\n\r\nabout the New Zealand Military Training Poll Act. There it tells you, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nit is one question which asks for a yes or a no. It says, Sir:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr David Marshall: The words of the 'New Zealand Military Training Poll Act say,\r\n\r\n\"I vote for/I vote against compulsory military training.\"'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In essence, it just asks for yes or no. And then, may I also refer you to column\r\n\r\n232 [Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May, 1962], at the bottom,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Byrne: Yes. Schedule Form of Voting-Paper.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>It asks for yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have this Jamaican Referendum Federation Law, which I need not\r\n\r\nmention because it was covered in detail by the Member for Anson. And then there\r\n\r\nis  the  Commonwealth  of  Australia Referendum  (Constitution  Alteration)  Act\r\n\r\n1906-1936,  Form  C,  which is referred to in column 159 of  the  same  Official\r\n\r\nReport. Again it says here, Sir, \"yes\" or \"no\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer you to the Plebeian, our Party organ of 8th June, 1962. There we have\r\n\r\na  series of questions from West Australia, Canada, France, Jamaica - all giving\r\n\r\nexamples of how one question was set. In Canada, it says here, the question  was\r\n\r\non the Dominion Plebiscite Act of 1942 on which a pubic vote was taken: \"Are you\r\n\r\nin  favour  of releasing the Government from any obligation arising out  of  any\r\n\r\npast  commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military  service?\"\r\n\r\nThen  there is a precedent in Western Australia in 1932. Here, again,  there  is\r\n\r\none  question: \"Are you in favour of the State of Western Australia  withdrawing\r\n\r\nfrom the Federal Commonwealth established under the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nCommonwealth  of Australia Constitution Act?\" Then there was the question  posed\r\n\r\nin  January 1961 for the people in France to say \"yes\" or \"no\": \"Do you  approve\r\n\r\nthe  Bill submitted to the French people by the President of the Republic?\"  And\r\n\r\nthen  there  was  the  Jamaica  one  which has  already  been  quoted.  Then  in\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, the referendum held on the 1st of April this year was on a proposal\r\n\r\nto  ban  the manufacture or deployment of atomic arms on Swiss soil. The  people\r\n\r\nwere asked to answer yes or no.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, let us see how the P.A.P. twisted and turned when it came to arguments\r\n\r\nwith  the Opposition in Select Committee. Let us trace the arguments from column\r\n\r\n115.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Byrne: Sir, I am aware, that in the case of Jamaica, the question was\r\n\r\nframed by the Legislative Assembly. That is clear from the Ordinance itself. All\r\n\r\nalong  I  have maintained that that was a specific law to deal with  a  specific\r\n\r\nreferendum question.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, the Minister for Health and Law admits that that is the  normal\r\n\r\npractice  but  that  because this is a general Referendum Bill  it  is  no  more\r\n\r\napplicable.  Yet, I can quote to you many, many instances where the P.A.P. have\r\n\r\nsaid that this Bill is for merger. They have said more than 25 times in all that\r\n\r\nthis is a general Referendum. I can quote you all the columns, Sir, but I do not\r\n\r\nthink  I  should waste your time. But I will quote the instances where they  say\r\n\r\nthat this Bill is for merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In column 87 Dr Goh said that. In column 84 Mr Byrne said that, by\r\n\r\nimplication. In column 151, Dr Goh said that.

In column 179 [Select Committee Official Report No. 4 dated 11th May,\r\n\r\n1962], the Minister for Home Affairs said that. In column 181, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance said categorically, \"Let us come down to brass tacks. This Bill  is  for\r\n\r\nmerger.\" Then in column 187, the Minister for Finance again said that. Then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, there was the amendment to the referendum motion by the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nIn  April which the Member for Anson has already quoted. Then in the Second Read\r\n\r\ning  of  the Bill, the Minister for Home Affairs said on 14th March, at page  4,\r\n\r\nlines  I  and  2  [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 1, col. 70], \"Sir,  when  the  Bill  was\r\n\r\ndrafted,  it was intended that in a referendum on merger . . .\". I need  not  go\r\n\r\nfurther.  Then on the same date, on page 5, the Minister for Home Affairs  again\r\n\r\nsaid at paragraph 3 [col. 73]:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mr Speaker, Sir, under the provisions 01 this Bill, the first matter to be\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to the electors for a referendum will be the terms and conditions  of\r\n\r\nmerger of Singapore with the Federation.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And then still on the Second Reading on 16th March, page 5, paragraph 3 [Hansard\r\n\r\nVol.  17, No. 3, col. 247], \"Dr Goh Keng Swee: At the referendum that is to  be\r\n\r\nheld after this Bill is passed . . . \". Therefore, merger by implication. But he\r\n\r\nstated  very  categorically in page 2, second line [col. 241], \"Everybody  knows\r\n\r\nthat  this  referendum  will be on merger, and merger has been  the  outstanding\r\n\r\npolitical issue before the country...\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then on page 20 [col. 267], on the same date, somewhere in the middle, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health and Law said. \"Machinery is being provided by this  Bill  to\r\n\r\nenable the referendum on merger to be held in a far and just manner.\" \"fair  and\r\n\r\njust\" - my eye! And then on the 16th, at page 29 [col. 280], this was said by  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"This Referendum Bill has been brought in to determine the wish of the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification of\r\n\r\nthese two territories.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that even the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister is not left out, on 17th\r\n\r\nApril, page 4, paragraph 3 [Hansard Vol.\r\n\r\n17, No. 8, col. 769], the whole paragraph\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nmore  or less refers to merger. I quote this, Sir, merely to show how the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave  been twisting and turning. Whenever they are cornered, whenever they think\r\n\r\nthis argument serves their purpose, they say. \"This Bill is a general Referendum\r\n\r\nBill.\" But when they find it convenient, as during discussion about the time  to\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  for canvassing, they say, \"Oh! you already have been talking  about\r\n\r\nmerger  for a long time,\" and they further categorically say, \"This Bill is  for\r\n\r\nmerger.\"  Let us go to col. 131 [Select Committee Official Report  No.  3  dated\r\n\r\n8th May, 1962] where Dr Goh Keng Swee says:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am in sympathy with a great deal of what the Member for Queenstown said,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  the questions must be simple; the issues must be made clear to the people\r\n\r\nso that they can make up their minds quite clearly...'.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He says, \"But whether that should apply to all referenda which may be carried\r\n\r\nout  in  future I am not so certain,\" implying again that in principle he agrees\r\n\r\nthat  everything we say is correct, but that since this may be a Referendum Bill\r\n\r\nfor  the smoking of tobacco or for drinking alcohol, therefore he cannot  agree.\r\n\r\nWe  had all the weight of authority and commonsense on our side. Sir, but  since\r\n\r\nthey  wanted to keep on twisting, there was nothing very much we could do  about\r\n\r\nit.  They  accepted the validity of our arguments, hut all the  time  they  were\r\n\r\nshielding  behind the phrase, \"This is a general Referendum Bill.\" The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Health and Law also said - and this has been quoted by the Member for Anson - \r\n\r\nthat  if  it  was a specific Bill there was nothing to prevent the  Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly  from deciding on the question to be put in a referendum. But  then  he\r\n\r\nfollowed  up again by saying that this was a general Referendum Bill.  And  then\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance again in column 134:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Goh Keng Swee: In view of the practice in other countries, I think it is\r\n\r\nunduly  restrictive  in the general referendum law -  such as we  are  considering\r\n\r\nnow - to limit the questions of the type which require only a yes or no answer.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>In other words, implying again that it is quite right we should have only one\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nquestion  put  to the people and that that question must be a simple  one  which\r\n\r\ndemands an answer of 'yes' or `no'. But since this is a general Referendum Bill,\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  have it. Then he further said in column 148 that multiple  questions\r\n\r\nare very complicated. Yet he insists on more than one question now.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the Minister for Finance why he feared posing one question to the\r\n\r\npeople,  and  his  answer was very categorical. May I refer you  to  column  323\r\n\r\n[Select Committee Official Report No. 5 dated 15th May, 1962]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dr Lee Siew Choh: Because of this New Clause (A). All doubts and risk of\r\n\r\nlosing  for  the  P.A.P. have at last been solved. How, I will explain  further.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two steps in this. The referendum, of course, would not  he  on  one\r\n\r\nquestion, because that would mean defeat for the P.A.P.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>What did the Minister for Finance say? He said, \"That is what you say.\" In other\r\n\r\nwords,  he  thinks that if the P.A.P. were to pose one question  to  the  people\r\n\r\nthere would still be the possibility that the P.A.P. might win. I hope they will\r\n\r\njust  pose the question and settle all doubts on the issue. Then when I referred\r\n\r\nto  his  anxiety about the P.A.P. losing, the Minister for Finance said  in  the\r\n\r\nsecond paragraph of column 326:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Far from our anxiety growing from month to month, on the contrary, whatever\r\n\r\nanxiety we had at the beginning has been gradually dispelled.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>And in the next page at column 327, he further said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"So we are not at all worried about their so-called propaganda campaign to\r\n\r\nconvince the people that this is a sell-out merger.\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>He  said that the crowds attending our rallies were dwindling in number and that\r\n\r\nour  house-to-house campaign had been a flop. He was not worried.. Yet in  spite\r\n\r\nof his anxiety having been gradually dispelled, he still dare not put one simple\r\n\r\nquestion  to the people concerning Command Paper No. 33 of 1961. There are  very\r\n\r\ngood reasons, Sir, why we think\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. should pose the White Paper merger proposals to the people.  A\r\n\r\nlot  of promises have been made concerning the P.A.P. merger proposals. Promises\r\n\r\nwere  made  by the Prime Minister as early as July during the Anson by-election,\r\n\r\nin  a rally at Tras Street. On 11th July, he said, \"The decision rests with  the\r\n\r\npeople  and not with the Ministers,\" and on 13th July in a rally held  near  the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police Headquarters, he again said, \"It is our business to  settle  the\r\n\r\nconditions and then it is for the people to decide.\" Probably they may decide in\r\n\r\na different manner. Then there was this radio talk which the Prime Minister gave\r\n\r\non 27th July and this was quoted in a radio forum by the Member for Hong Lim.  I\r\n\r\nhave  just got this from the Library and it says here in big headlines \"NO SELL-OUT-LEE TELLS THE PEOPLE\".\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> What is the date of the paper?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is dated 27th July, 1961 - The Straits Times.

What  is  more\r\n\r\ninteresting  is that he explained the mechanics of the voting in the referendum.\r\n\r\nIn the Press interview, he said that all the voters need do is to put a cross in\r\n\r\nthe space indicating yes if they agree and a cross in the space indicating no if\r\n\r\nthey  do not agree. And following that on the 15th of October a letter was  sent\r\n\r\nto  the  Opposition and a Press statement was issued. I will quote. I am reading\r\n\r\nfrom  a  Singapore  Government Press Statement dated 14th October.  The  heading\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The  Prime  Minister and Leader of the House reply to Opposition's call  for  a\r\n\r\nspecial Assembly Session.\" I will read it, Sir:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The following are texts of letters written by the Prime Minister, Mr Lee\r\n\r\nKuan  Yew, and the Leader of the House, Dr Toh Chin Chye, to the  Chairmen  of\r\n\r\nthree  Opposition Parties who, after a meeting on October 6th. 1961, in a  joint\r\n\r\nletter called for a special Assembly session to discuss the question of merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Party Chairmen to whom the letters were sent are Dr Lee Siew Choh\r\n\r\nof  the Barisan Sosialis, Mr Ong Eng Guan of the United People's Party, and Mr\r\n\r\nDavid Marshal1 of the Workers' Party.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>I  will  now  quote  you the relevant paragraphs.

Not only you as Members of the Opposition  but  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the people of Singapore should be fully informed of the agreement  in\r\n\r\nprinciple...'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Agreement in principle!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that has been reached between the two Governments.

Obviously, Sir, the P.A.P. idea of accept\r\n\r\nor  reject means to add another alternative which is unacceptable to the people.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is typical of the P.A.P. twist and turn. I am just wondering  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  forgotten  all this. Mind you, Sir, these are  all  solemn  words,\r\n\r\nwritten  in  black  and white. And what did the Minister for Finance  say  about\r\n\r\nsolemn  words?  The  Minister  for Health and Law  said  \"perfect  co-ordination\r\n\r\nbetween the brain and tongue\". Those are the operative words of the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  and  Law about words spoken by the Prime Minister, solemn  words.  Well,\r\n\r\nmake sure that they are solemn. Make sure that they mean what they say. That  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Minister for Finance has been trying to tell us - that the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nalways chooses his words very well.

I think the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson has already dealt with it, but it can bear repeating. What we\r\n\r\nwant to say is this: that the P.A.P. must not make a mockery of democracy. If\r\n\r\nunacceptable questions are posed to the people, then it will only lead to open\r\n\r\nreferendum rigging, and the present Referendum Bill is merely a legal cover for\r\n\r\nsuch referendum rigging. I have given examples of unacceptable questions: Do you\r\n\r\nwant the voter to choose death by electrocution or by hanging? Under those\r\n\r\ncircumstances, surely you do not expect the voter to choose anything. The voter\r\n\r\nwants to live, but he is offered only alternatives of dying. To give another\r\n\r\nexample - he may be asked to be either a cow or a horse. Surely you do not expect\r\n\r\nthe voter to choose one of these two alternatives. Of course, now their pet\r\n\r\nsubject is the Penang type of merger. But this Penang type of merger is a\r\n\r\ndistortion of the Opposition stand. The Member for Anson has already dealt with\r\n\r\nthis adequately. But I will just repeat this. The Opposition stand on the merger\r\n\r\nissue is that all Singapore citizens must become Federation citizens on merger,\r\n\r\nand there must be adequate proportional representation. And let us tell the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. this: however much they may want to distort, however much they may go on\r\n\r\nto the radio. Redifiusion, radio talks, Press statements about the Penang type\r\n\r\nof merger, they will not deceive the people as to what is the actual stand of\r\n\r\nthe Opposition.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Marshall in the forum said that you made a mistake!

The original intention of the P.A.P., from what I have already indicated\r\n\r\nto  you, was to pose to the people one simple question requiring a simple answer\r\n\r\nof  \"yes\" or \"no\" to their merger proposals. The few bits that I read out to you\r\n\r\nwere  clear  enough. It was intended the people were to be asked  to  accept  or\r\n\r\nreject  them. That was that. But unfortunately for the P.A.P., as time went  on,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. realised that their sellout merger was completely exposed.  See  the\r\n\r\nway  they  had  to reveal the information on the merger proposals - by  dribs  and\r\n\r\ndrabs!  They  came out with the word \"national\" being equal to  \"citizen\".  Then\r\n\r\nthey came out with excuses that automatic citizenship was impossible. Later they\r\n\r\nsaid  it was unreasonable. Still later they gave excuses about residential quali\r\n\r\nfication, and so on and so forth. The mere fact that they had to reveal this bit\r\n\r\nby  bit is already evidence enough that there was something which they dared not\r\n\r\ntell the people about. There was something which the P.A.P. themselves know  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  object  to  very  much. The P.A.P. knew  that  the  people  would\r\n\r\ndefinitely  condemn them for having negotiated for such proposals on  behalf  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But then, of course, we must realise that at that time the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nin  no  position to negotiate. The Prime Minister went up and down, begging  the\r\n\r\nTunku  on  bended knees to accept his merger proposals. You will remember,  Sir,\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Tunku said in a debate in the Federation Parliament, namely that  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister of Singapore had gone along to beg of him to help him out of  his\r\n\r\ntroubles.  Therefore,  to help out the Prime Minister of  Singapore,  he  kindly\r\n\r\naccepted the proposals put to him.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

Let me go back to the exposure of this  P.A.P. referendum\r\n\r\nplot.  As  the sell-out nature of the P.A.P. merger proposals was seen  through,\r\n\r\nand  especially  after the debate in the House on the merger issue,  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncame to realise that if they were to put those very proposals to the people  for\r\n\r\nendorsement or rejection, it would be rejection and not endorsement. Instead of\r\n\r\na  \"yes\"  which  they had hoped for, it would have been a \"no\". Therefore,  when\r\n\r\nthis  Bill was put forward, they already had the intention of posing two or more\r\n\r\nquestions to the electorate. Those questions, of course, would have to be framed\r\n\r\nin  such  a  way that they would be completely unacceptable to the  people.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. proposals  would be one of the alternatives, and the  other  alternative\r\n\r\nwould be something worse. The people would be asked to choose between two evils,\r\n\r\nand  it  was  expected, according to P.A.P. calculations, that the people  would\r\n\r\nchoose\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe lesser of two evils. Under those circumstances, it was calculated that possi\r\n\r\nbly  the P.A.P. might get away with it and the P.A.P. merger proposals would  be\r\n\r\ncarried  in the referendum. That was the plot of the P.A.P. As regards  how  the\r\n\r\nchange came later on, I will come to that when we discuss the blank vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But up to this stage we can see that the P.A.P. wanted to have a snap re\r\n\r\nferendum,  and that snap referendum can be seen from clauses 40,  41,  and  also\r\n\r\nclauses  5,  6, and 13. \"No canvassing allowed\" with two unacceptable  questions\r\n\r\nsuddenly  pounced on the people. That was the plot. As we go  on  to  the  other\r\n\r\nclauses, I shall come to the other parts of the plot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch a little on clause 18 because I have filed an amendment\r\n\r\nthere, but I wonder whether I should wait until clause 18 is discussed.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Wait for clause 18.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> In this clause 18 I merely ask for a form of ballot paper\r\n\r\nto  be put in a Schedule.

This is all in line with the idea of  a\r\n\r\nsnap  referendum  and the fact that they have so far refused even  to  accept  a\r\n\r\nsimple  amendment like this shows to what low level the thinking of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas sunk.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want now to go into the details of this ballot paper, and I think I\r\n\r\nwill  reserve  it until we come to the clause itself. But I want to  impress  on\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, that all these amendments that we ask for are only put in so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  have  an  honest, fair, and just referendum. If the people's wishes  should\r\n\r\ncoincide  with  the wishes of the P.A.P., then there is no need to  go  to  such\r\n\r\nlengths  as to pose unacceptable questions, or to put in blank votes  and  other\r\n\r\nundemocratic provisions in the Bill. The Ministers opposite have repeatedly said\r\n\r\nthat  it  should be a fair and just referendum, but so far we have  proved  that\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  is  very unfair, unjust and very undemocratic. The test  before  the\r\n\r\npeople today, Sir, is whether or not the people will be given an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nexpress  their  wishes and aspirations in a peaceful and constitutional  manner;\r\n\r\nwhether or not they will be allowed to say \"no\" in a peaceful and constitutional\r\n\r\nmanner. If the P.A.P. insist on their Fascist behaviour, and if they insist in the\r\n\r\nway  they  are going about it, then it will only mean the death of parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy.  And it will prove to the world that parliamentary democracy  can  be\r\n\r\ndestroyed by people who do not know how to make use of power when they gain it.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote, Sir, from the Report of Proceedings of the Seventh Commonwealth\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Conference  held  in  London  in  September,  1961.

The main contention of the Opposition is that the Bill  should\r\n\r\ncontain  provisions for only one question to he asked. I pointed out during  the\r\n\r\ndebate  on  the motion moved by the Member for Anson on the 17th of April,  1962\r\n\r\n[Hansard  Vol. 17 No. 8], that the National Referendum Bill was a  general  Refe\r\n\r\nrendum  Bill. In the motion moved by the Member for Anson on 17th of  April, he\r\n\r\nmentioned  specifically  a  referendum  oil  merger.  I  quite  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum on the Federation/Singapore merger is a specific referendum. But this\r\n\r\nreferendum  cannot  be  conducted until the National Referendum  Bill  has  been\r\n\r\npassed. Therefore, when the Member for Anson earlier on quoted me and said  that\r\n\r\nI was at variance with what I had said previously, it is not quite correct.\r\n\r\nI put to you a very simple question.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  agreed  that  the National Referendum Bill is  a  general  Bill  for\r\n\r\nreferenda  that may be held in the future, it is pretty obvious that it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  pre-determine the nature of the question that may be asked.  There\r\n\r\nfore, allowance must be given to the fact that the question to be formulated\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nin future years will vary according to the problem that is being put before the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, in particular the Member for Anson and the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  are  specific that a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" should  be  given  to  a\r\n\r\nquestion  in a referendum. I will give you a simple example. We are  all  agreed\r\n\r\nthat  if a person is thirsty, he must drink. That is an obvious fact which  none\r\n\r\ncan  deny. If you are thirsty, you must drink. So it would be ridiculous for  us\r\n\r\nto go along and ask Members of this House to vote \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question:\r\n\r\n\"Are  you  going to drink if you are thirsty?\" For Members of this House  to  be\r\n\r\nasked  to answer the question by a \"yes\" or a \"no\" is the height of foolishness,\r\n\r\nif not ridicule. Having agreed that a person who is thirsty must drink, the next\r\n\r\nobvious and logical question to ask is \"What sort of drink do you want?  Do  you\r\n\r\nwant  tea  with or without milk? Do you want coffee black or white? Do you  want\r\n\r\nyour  tea  or  coffee with or without sugar? Or do you just want plain  water?\"\r\n\r\nThese  are  obvious choices.

Nonetheless, the choice has to\r\n\r\nbe  given. But we are all agreed on one basic question, in this analogy of mine,\r\n\r\nthat it is necessary to drink if you are thirsty. And having agreed on that,  we\r\n\r\nmust  decide  what  drink we want. Now, coming back to a more specific  problem.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this House cannot deny that the principle of merger is accepted  by\r\n\r\nall Parties. Merger has been accepted by all Parties in Singapore because it  is\r\n\r\nthe economic solution for Singapore. Just to prove what I have said, may I quote\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Anson in column 557 in the debate on merger on 23rd  November,\r\n\r\n1961, in Hansard, Volume 15, No. 7? This is what the Member for Anson said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"And, Sir, in case there is any suggestions as to when I and my Party began to\r\n\r\nbelieve in merger, here is a dog-eared copy of the very first and the only party\r\n\r\nplatform of the Workers' Party on its formation in December of 1957, in the very\r\n\r\nfirst paragraph and in the first sentence, it says.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The basis and framework of all policy must be recognition of the fact that\r\n\r\nSingapore is geographically, ethnically, and economically part of Malaya and the\r\n\r\nonly healthy ultimate solution is integration with Malaya on an equal basis with\r\n\r\nother states...'\"\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The Member for Anson accepts that there must be merger. But it must be merger on\r\n\r\nan  equal basis with other States, either with Penang, Malacca, Johore, Selangor\r\n\r\nor  Perak. The Member for Queenstown, during the debate on the motion  moved  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson on the 17th of April, said this at page 24 of the  revised\r\n\r\ntranscript  dated 18th April, 1962 [Hansard Vol. 17, No. 9, col. 879].  This  is\r\n\r\nwhat the Member for Queenstown said:\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Culture say that merger is a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. pledge. Let me tell them right here and now:\r\n\r\nit  is  all  poppycock and nonsense, because merger was on the platform  of  all\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in Singapore.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>The  Member for Anson accepts merger. The Member for Queenstown accepts  merger.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Member for Queenstown even goes to the extent of saying that  all\r\n\r\npolitical Parties in Singapore want merger. The Member for Hong Limb in the same\r\n\r\ndebate, said this on page\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n36  of  the  revised transcript dated 17th April [Hansard Vol. 17, No.  8,  col.\r\n\r\n813]:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If the worst comes to the worst and the people were asked what type of merger\r\n\r\nthey would prefer, then the ballot paper should put forward the two alternatives\r\n\r\nwhich the two groups of Parties in this Assembly have supported.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  I wish the House to confirm that all Parties in this Chamber, and in  fact\r\n\r\naccording  to the Member for Queenstown, all Parties who stood for election  in\r\n\r\n1959 had merger as their platform.\r\n\r\ntn other words, nobody is against the principle of merger. The Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  would  like Singapore to be merged with the Federation on an equal  basis\r\n\r\nlike any of the other States in the Federation. The Member for Hong Lim goes  to\r\n\r\nthe  extent of even accepting that it might well be that two alternatives should\r\n\r\nbe  placed on the ballot paper. So I say, Mr Chairman, that the fuss now kicked\r\n\r\nup  by Members of the Opposition in moving this amendment that only one question\r\n\r\nshould  be  asked  in  the referendum is absolutely irrelevant.  What  they  are\r\n\r\nseeking to do is not merely to draw a red herring, but I would even charge  them\r\n\r\nthat  they  are just trying to prevent this Bill from being passed  so  that  by\r\n\r\nfilibustering they hope to delay the day of decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, under these circumstances, I can see no grounds why the Member for Queenstown, the Member for Anson and the Member for Hong Lim have insisted that only one question should be asked in the referendum on merger, and that a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer is required. As I have pointed out in my analogy\r\n\r\npreviously,  if  the principle of merger is accepted, then the  people  must  be\r\n\r\nasked  on the mode and manner of merger. Just as I said, if it is accepted  that\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary for us to drink if we are thirsty, then it must be asked  what\r\n\r\ndrink do you want?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Take salt water!\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Well, if the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown likes salt water, we are surrounded by the sea\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nand he can drink as much salt water as he likes. We are not stopping him. And if\r\n\r\nhe  wants the Rochore Canal water, I cannot stop him either. I will come back to\r\n\r\none  basic conclusion. The number of minutes which have been spent by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson and the Member for Queenstown on this amendment refutes all that they\r\n\r\nhave  said  in  the past during the debate on merger. Under these circumstances,\r\n\r\ntheir amendment to this clause cannot be accepted.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Chairman, yet one more blatant contradiction to emblazon on\r\n\r\ntheir  shield.

This was reinforced  by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister on the 17th of April, page 8 of the revised transcript [Hansard Vol.\r\n\r\n17, No. 8, col. 774]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...as I have already explained, the Minister for Home Affairs last year,\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on merger, introduced the Singapore National Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nwith  one prospect, and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their  own\r\n\r\ninterest  to  go to a referendum to state specifically how the reunification  of\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Federation should be brought about.'\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>If  English  has  any meaning, what is the meaning of \"one prospect\"?  Today  he\r\n\r\ntalks  about drinking - I forget which canal water; Rochore Canal water; and  salt\r\n\r\nwater.  Drinking salt water makes people mad, and it does bring about a  certain\r\n\r\naberration.  And  if he tells us that he has been drinking salt  water,  we  can\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  change  of stand which he so blatantly  and  unblushingly  puts\r\n\r\nforward  today.  But  I have not heard him admit that either  he  or  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  been drinking any salt water. Apart from that, we have  a  solemn\r\n\r\namendment to the motion which, by virtue of the Government majority, was  passed\r\n\r\nby  this House. We have no reason to doubt that this was a specific Bill  for  a\r\n\r\nspecific  purpose, and that purpose was a referendum on merger.

They tell  us  now  because  they  find  it\r\n\r\ninconvenient to agree that the question should be posed. They tell us that this\r\n\r\nis  a  general  Referendum Bill for drinking water or ginger pop. Mr  Chairman,\r\n\r\nvery well. But do they recognise - and this is a simple question - that the issue of\r\n\r\nthe  merger proposals is vital to the welfare of the people? It is so  vital  to\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the people that it merits a Bill all by itself. If they want this\r\n\r\nas   a   general  Referendum  Bill,  would  they  introduce  a  Referendum  Bill\r\n\r\nspecifically for the merger? Is that so unfair? Could they not introduce one? It\r\n\r\nis  a  very  short  one. We have a form in the Jamaican one.  Mr  Speaker,  you\r\n\r\nyourself  are  conscious that I sought to introduce a motion in this  House  for\r\n\r\nleave  to  introduce a Bill myself for the purpose of merger with the Federation\r\n\r\nand a referendum thereon, and you ruled it out of order because you stated, Sir - \r\n\r\nthough  I do not have the letter; it is your letter and I hope, if I incorrectly\r\n\r\nquote  you,  you  will correct me - that that was out of order because  there  was\r\n\r\nalready  a  Bill specifically for a referendum on the merger in accordance  with\r\n\r\nthis motion.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Not one word was said by  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister on that aspect.

Since he has asked me a specific\r\n\r\nquestion, then I think I have to answer it. The Member for Anson was not  paying\r\n\r\nattention  when  I  drew my analogy that if we all accept  the  principle,  then\r\n\r\nobviously  the  next  question which we must go  to  is,  how  do  we  go  about\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  principle? The example I drew upon was  that  if  a  man  is\r\n\r\nthirsty,  it  is accepted that he must drink to quench his thirst, otherwise  he\r\n\r\nwill  just die. Therefore, having decided that he must drink, you have  to  give\r\n\r\nhim  a  choice  of  what  he wants to drink. Now, I have pointed  out  examples,\r\n\r\nquotations  made by the Member for Anson, the Member for Queenstown, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Hong Lim, that they are all in favour of the principle of merger. They might\r\n\r\nnot  agree with us that the White Paper is a step forward. In fact, I think they\r\n\r\nwalked out of the Chamber when the vote was hut on that occasion. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson has stated during the debate on merger that he accepts merger as the  only\r\n\r\nultimate solution and that is by way of integration\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith Malaya on an equal basis with other States. Surely he is not withdraw\r\n\r\ning  that  statement. It is a basic policy of his Party. He, in fact,  says  \"If\r\n\r\nthere is any suggestion as to when I and my Party began to believe in merger, we\r\n\r\nhave a copy of the very first, and the only party platform of the Workers' Party\r\n\r\non  its formation in December 1959,\" meaning, of course, that the Workers' Party\r\n\r\nhas always stood for merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It is quite correct. Therefore. I see no reason. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  why  the Bill which is before us should not be used to initiate  a  referendum  on  merger. There is no objection to it. Mr Marshall  took  objection\r\n\r\nbecause I said it was a Bill designed for referenda besides that on merger.  Now\r\n\r\nassume  that  this is a Bill specifically designed to carry out a referendum  on\r\n\r\nmerger.  We  have  all  agreed in this House that merger is  essential.  Without\r\n\r\nmerger it will be like committing hara kiri.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The P.A.P.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> It will be like committing suicide. You are afraid we will\r\n\r\nask  the  citizens of Singapore: \"Do you want to live?\" \"Do you want to  commit\r\n\r\nsuicide?\"  Do the Members of the Opposition sincerely believe that we are  going\r\n\r\nto  put  forward  such an idiotic question before the people: \"Do  you  want  to\r\n\r\nlive?\" And ask them to answer yes or no. They all have accepted merger. And  the\r\n\r\nreason,  they  all  understand,  is that it is vital  to  the  economic  life  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If Assemblymen say they represent the people of Singapore,  then  it\r\n\r\nmust  he obviously concluded that since all political Parties have accepted  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  merger, the people also accept the principle  of  merger.  Having\r\n\r\nagreed  on that basis, we must therefore arrive upon the manner and the mode  in\r\n\r\nwhich  this merger must be carried rut. Therefore, I see no reason whatever  why\r\n\r\nthe  Members  in  the  Opposition should insist that there  ought  only  be  one\r\n\r\nquestion  put  in  the referendum for merger or that there should  be  a  simple\r\n\r\nanswer yes or no. Now, as I\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nhave  pointed  out, before we can execute the referendum on Federation/Singapore\r\n\r\nmerger,  this  Bill must be got through and this Bill is designed  not  only  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  the  referendum on merger, but also other referenda which  may  take\r\n\r\nplace in the future. I see really no objection why this Bill should not be  used\r\n\r\nto  implement  the  referendum on merger. Therefore, there would  be  no  reason\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  why  a  special  Bill must be passed  specially  to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nreferendum for merger.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, we on the Front Bench here have been sitting very quietly listening to  the\r\n\r\ngems  of  wisdom  from the mouths of the Member for Anson  and  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  I did not think of joining in the debate so early, but  because  my\r\n\r\nname has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Anson, I think it is time that  I\r\n\r\nshould  rise  and  say  my  piece. First of all, he said  that  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  is so ready to accept the assurance of the Government. May  I  assure\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson that the Member for Cairnhill is never so naive? In  fact,\r\n\r\nif  he  will  look  at  the amendment proposed by him to clause  13,  it  is  my\r\n\r\nintention, when that clause comes up for debate, to move an amendment to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  questions  to be posed in a referendum should be  as  framed  by  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly. That will tie the Government down to voting for\r\n\r\nit.  If the Government vote against it, then it will be clear that what they say\r\n\r\nis  one  thing  and  what they mean is another, and that  they  cannot  keep  on\r\n\r\nclaiming  that  they  always mean what they say, and say what  they  mean.  This\r\n\r\ndebate  is  going  to be like the debate on merger where a lot of  unnecessarily\r\n\r\nhard  words were exchanged by both sides of the House. Even the Member for Anson\r\n\r\nhas  said that the Minister for Law has said that the law can turn a man into  a\r\n\r\nwoman and, if I remember rightly, when I was in the Government with him, it  was\r\n\r\nexplained  to  me  that  under  the law, the male always  embraces  the  female.\r\n\r\n[Laughter] So, therefore, it means that when you say \"man\" under the law, it can\r\n\r\nalso mean a woman.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to understand the dingdong battle that has been waged\r\n\r\nbetween  the  P.A.P. and the ex-P.A.P., i.e., the Banisan now,  and  the  lone\r\n\r\nvoice of the Workers' Party, the Member for Anson, one must go back to  the\r\n\r\ntime  when  there was a radio forum at which the Minister for Finance,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown, the Member for Farrer Park, and the Member for  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  were  present. A question was posed to the forum as to their  view  on\r\n\r\nwhether  it  was more desirable to hold a referendum or a general  election\r\n\r\nin  order  to ascertain the views of the electorate on merger.  The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown  insisted  that  there should  be  general  elections.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  is ever fond of calling for general  elections  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  see  the  P.A.P. removed from office. But the  Banisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nMembers forget that they were returned as P.A.P. Members, and if they  wish\r\n\r\nto  sit on our side of the House it will be better for them to get a  fresh\r\n\r\nmandate from the people.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

So in a way the Government was committed  to  a\r\n\r\nreferendum.  Therefore, the Government introduced a Bill for First  Reading\r\n\r\nsome  months ago and I must say, well the Government can deny it,  that  at\r\n\r\nthat particular time, what was in their minds was that they would pose  one\r\n\r\nquestion  to  the electorate. In fact, the utterances of the Front  Benches\r\n\r\nof the Government  clearly  indicated that that was their intention. They meant  to  put\r\n\r\nWhite Paper 33 to the electorate for them to pass judgment.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the days went by, Sir, the P.A.P. began to have qualms because it was\r\n\r\nthen  felt  by them that if they were to pose that one simple question  for\r\n\r\nthe  verdict  of the electorate, the majority of the electorate  would  say\r\n\r\nno.  They  would say no, not because they do not want merger,  not  because\r\n\r\nthey do not\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant  closer relationship with the Federation of Malaya; they would say no  just\r\n\r\nto  show their disgust at the Government and their great desire that the sooner\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  Government  is buried, the healthier it would  be  for  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the Second Reading of the Bill was postponed for a  month  or  two.\r\n\r\nBut  then the bright lads of the P.A.P. suddenly thought of a wonderful scheme.\r\n\r\nYou  know  the  P.A.P. are  wonderful schemers. They  suddenly  thought  of  a\r\n\r\nwonderful scheme. \"Ah, ah! I think we could win this referendum if we  were  to\r\n\r\npose  more  than one question, so long as the question in regard to Cmd.  Paper\r\n\r\n33  is going to be the only sensible, reasonable and advantageous question.\" So\r\n\r\nthey thought it would be a good thing if they were to put two questions to  the\r\n\r\nelectorate  such  as:  \"Do you want the P.A.F. type merger  whereby  we  retain\r\n\r\nautonomy  in  education and labour, or do you want the Barisan type  of  merger\r\n\r\nwhereby  340,000 non-local born citizens would lose their citizenship  rights?\"\r\n\r\nIf  they  were to pose those two questions to the electorate, Sir,  surely  the\r\n\r\n340,000  non-local-born citizens will vote for the P.A.P. because they want  to\r\n\r\nretain  their  citizenship rights, and 340,000 non-local-born citizens  are  al\r\n\r\nready  in  the majority.
