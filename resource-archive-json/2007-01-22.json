I hope to complete the reviews within the next few months so that we can have them implemented this year.&nbsp; There will be many rounds of public consultations during the review so that we can forge the best solutions for Singaporeans.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic MediShield reform is more straight-forward.&nbsp; We did one last year which has brought about many benefits.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 925<p>The industry structure is now sustainable.&nbsp; Cherry-picking has been eliminated.&nbsp; MediShield has regained its financial viability.&nbsp; Patients with large bills have benefited from larger payouts, with co-payment reduced from 60% to 40% of hospital bills.&nbsp; They have saved thousands of dollars.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But 40% is still high for many patients.&nbsp; Preliminary soundings suggest that Singaporeans are prepared to pay higher premiums for greater MediShield payout, provided the premium increase is not too big.&nbsp; Our actuary consultant is helping us in the review.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we are reviewing the deductible imposed on the private MediShield enhancement policies.&nbsp; The current level of $3,000 may be too high and there is scope to reduce it by $500 or so.&nbsp; We will settle the details within a month or two.&nbsp; This will particularly benefit the middle income group who use the private unsubsidised wards.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for ElderShield, this is a four-year-old scheme launched in 2002 to provide some basic financial protection for Singaporeans with severe disabilities.&nbsp; It is contractually bound for a review and renewal by September this year.&nbsp; So we will conclude the review within the next few months and be clear on what to do come September.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our actuary consultant has been on this assignment for a few months now but it is a&nbsp; complicated review.&nbsp; I hope to achieve clarity by next month so that we can discuss more of this in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):&nbsp;</B> Sir, supplementary question on MediShield.&nbsp; Could I ask the Minister whether he is concerned about the 30% of Singaporeans who are not covered under MediShield?&nbsp; How does this group of people pay for their high hospital bills as many of them, in fact, belong to the less <p align=left>Column: 926<p>well-off group?&nbsp; If the Minister is going to reply that they can apply to Medifund to pay for their bills, then may I ask him how long will the present Medifund last, taking into consideration the increasing life expectancy of the majority and the fast ageing population?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, may I ask the Minister whether MediShield can only be claimed through hospitalisation as&nbsp;many illnesses can now be treated under day-surgery?&nbsp; Should we not heed to prevent over-consumption incentives in the design of medical insurance?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B> <B>:</B> &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am certainly as concerned as Dr Lily Neo and, rightly so, because if you stay out of insurance thinking that you will never fall very sick, then when you are hit with a major illness, life will be rough on you.&nbsp; As for the 30% uninsured - I thought it was 25%&nbsp;but I cannot remember the figure but it is a significant minority - not necessarily all of them belong to the lower income group.&nbsp; I have looked at some of the data and there are those in&nbsp;the middle-class and&nbsp;many of them are housewives of middle-income families.&nbsp; My message remains the same:&nbsp; please buy insurance for your spouse.&nbsp; Most of them are female who are not working and they look after the family, so as husbands, please look after them and buy them insurance.&nbsp; But a large number are children who are not yet in the workforce.&nbsp; Because they are&nbsp;young, their insurance is actually very low.&nbsp; I remember it is only about&nbsp;$30 a year.&nbsp; Please buy insurance for your children as well.&nbsp; They may be young and fit, but you never know, when something happens and you want to buy insurance,&nbsp;they may be excluded because of&nbsp;pre-existing illness.&nbsp; It is far better to sign them on when they are young and healthy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we have discussed&nbsp;this in this House several months ago.&nbsp; A large number of them are young and below 20 <p align=left>Column: 927<p>years old.&nbsp; We will eventually catch up with them because once they start working and contribute to CPF, we have a way of reminding them. But it&nbsp;is the spouses whom some husbands may have forgotten, but please sign them on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the adequacy of Medifund, certainly with ageing, the demand will grow and that is why every year, around this time, I will be reminding the Minister for Finance to top up Medifund, if possible.&nbsp; There is an immediate target to double it to $2 billion and I am sure the Minister for Finance will be sympathetic.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

My second question is what will be done to assist older&nbsp;and lower-income&nbsp;Singaporeans who do not have enough Medisave savings to take care of their healthcare needs and also to pay for their MediShield premiums.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question is to ask the Minister whether he will review the upper limit imposed on Medisave&nbsp;funds because&nbsp;once it reaches a certain amount it will roll over into the Ordinary Account.&nbsp;

<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B> <B>:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I can certainly assure the Member&nbsp;that affordability must be one of the key elements in the design of the 3M system because, if it is not affordable,&nbsp;what is the point.&nbsp; It may be a good plan on paper but if most people are excluded, then it does not serve any purpose.&nbsp; That is the reason why in the last MediShield reform, I sought advice <p align=left>Column: 928<p>from Members and I remember Mdm Halimah and Dr Neo gave me very good advice that the premium increase should not exceed single digit which limits it to about $10 a month.&nbsp; That is why we designed the last MediShield reform that way.&nbsp; But once you are limited by&nbsp;$10 per month, the payout is also limited and that is why I was not able to bring the co-payment down from 60% to 20% which was the target I set out&nbsp;to do.&nbsp; But, never mind, we achieved quite a good outcome in reducing it to 40% and this year I hope that the public, at least based on the&nbsp;people whom we have spoken to during the focus group discussions, will find it reasonable to have another round of increase of a few dollars a month and,&nbsp;hopefully to bring co-payment&nbsp;down to 20%, if possible.&nbsp; The various computations are actively being done now.&nbsp; I hope this is something that we can achieve and we can discuss this next month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the inadequacy of Medisave for the elderly, whenever the budget allows it, we have some top-ups for the elderly.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the Budget Statement next month.&nbsp; Hopefully, there is some good news for us&nbsp;too.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As to the acceptance of ElderShield, I am quite glad that the last few times when I looked at the subscription level - because we have a system now, whenever Singaporeans reach the age of 40,&nbsp;a notice will go out to them to encourage them to sign on&nbsp;- those who objected and said, \"No, I don't want&nbsp;to sign on.\", I think it is down to about 10%.&nbsp; So, in terms of flow, 90% of Singaporeans who reach 40 are signing on to ElderShield.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is good and&nbsp;there is a better understanding of the need of such a severe disability plan.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, as at end-2005, Singaporeans aged between 61 and 65, have an average Medisave balance of $11,700. So it is about $12,000.&nbsp; This can cover about 10 normal episodes of Class B2 hospitalisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 1st April, 2006, we raised the inpatient withdrawal limit for Medisave from $300 to $400 per day of hospitalisation.&nbsp; The purpose is to help Singaporeans cope with their hospitalisation cost, particularly for those who choose to stay in the unsubsidised wards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to this, Medisave covered, on average, 67% and 52% of the Class B1 and Class A/private hospital bills respectively.&nbsp; After the change, the Medisave coverage has increased to 76% and 57% respectively, reducing the patients&rsquo; out-of-pocket expenses.&nbsp; The change has also benefited patients in Class B2/C.&nbsp; They can now use Medisave to pay for more than 95% of their bills.&nbsp; So, it is practically the full amount.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim asked if the change has led to more patients in restructured hospitals opting for private wards.&nbsp; The evidence based on five months of data does not support such a view.&nbsp; I am glad that patients have remained prudent in their choice of wards in accordance with what they can afford.&nbsp; This will help conserve their Medisave balances for their future needs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So for a person having diabetes at 40 years old now, or hypertension as well, the question&nbsp;is whether there will be enough Medisave by the time he actually retires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; I am very concerned about this particular topic because $11,000 or $12,000 is a five-digit figure, but it is not a big number, bearing in mind that you have many years to go.&nbsp; With medical science, life expectancy is growing every decade by a year or two.&nbsp; So, really, people should look at Medisave carefully and try to conserve, and that is the reason I have to be the very unpopular gatekeeper now and&nbsp;then when Members put up their hands and say, \"Please, can I use Medisave for this and for that?\",&nbsp;I have to always bring them back to the original purpose of Medisave, which is for costly hospitalisation.&nbsp; So when it is for outpatient treatment, a few dollars, or even if it is tens of dollars, please pay for it out of your pocket and conserve the amount in Medisave for the old age, especially at the time when you will not be working.&nbsp; That is why it took us 20 years after we introduced Medisave to decide to make a major change, which is from inpatient to outpatient, but even then to restrict it to&nbsp;4 chronic illnesses and we have to restrict it carefully.&nbsp; We have started it for four diseases.&nbsp; Implementation so far has been&nbsp; smooth.&nbsp; It is a little bit of leap of faith.&nbsp; If&nbsp;all patients follow, comply with the instructions of their doctors and manage their chronic illnesses while they are still mild, the hope is that we can avoid very costly complications 20 or&nbsp;30 years down the road.&nbsp; So, on a life-time basis, hopefully, you save money and not just deplete your funds.&nbsp; That is why for the extension of this scheme to other illnesses,&nbsp;we restrict it to those where <p align=left>Column: 933<p>there are clear-cut disease management protocols and not just for any kind of outpatient treatment.&nbsp; Because if it is purely consumption without any impact on the future health, then I think we should not do so.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Health screening is a most interesting topic.&nbsp; It covers a wide field.&nbsp; There are a lot of self-interested parties with personal interest at play when they push for certain kinds of screening.&nbsp; For one,&nbsp;some of those esoteric health screenings cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to pick up things which often the patient would die before that thing kills him. That means he dies of something else and not because of that.&nbsp; Because the scanning technology is now so advanced, you can pick up all sorts of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody is perfect and we have&nbsp;all kinds of&nbsp;problems with us in the body but&nbsp;we&nbsp;may not die of those things, but die of something else.&nbsp; But if you pick it up, and the US begins to coin a term called \"pre-disease\",&nbsp;you are in fact healthy people, but if you are pre-diseased, you are pre-diabetes, you are pre-whatever,&nbsp;it merely&nbsp;caused you so much anxiety and,&nbsp;of course, along the way some of the hospitals may come in to say, \"Do this, do that.\"&nbsp; And because in the US, they allow advertising of prescription drugs,&nbsp;you are just making the&nbsp;population hypochrondriac.&nbsp; And when they go to the doctor, they ask, \"Please <p align=left>Column: 934<p>prescribe this, please prescribe that.\", and the money just run out but, at the same time, their health does not improve.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for screening, please take it with, shall I&nbsp;say, &nbsp;\"a pinch of salt\".&nbsp;&nbsp;All&nbsp;I know is some of the most effective health screenings which really make sense, which really prolong life and improve health are rather inexpensive, which is, what is your blood pressure, your cholesterol level, and those basic tests are really very cheap which most people can afford.&nbsp; If you cannot afford it, as MPs, as organised by Dr Lily Neo for many years, we do it on a community level and we can help subsidise them.&nbsp; But for those esoteric $600 or $700 type of screening,&nbsp;if you feel that it will benefit you, please pay for it yourself and do not look to me for subsidy or for Medisave to be used.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NEW HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS--><p align=left>Column: 934<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:NEW HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS:::935--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

At the same time, the horn and hazard warning lights of the errant vehicle will be activated.&nbsp; When the alarm is activated, the Hazmat Transport Vehicle Tracking System (HTVTS) operators will verify with the company involved to ascertain the nature of the violations, eg, transportation of hazardous cargoes outside of the regulated transportation routes or hours without prior approval from SCDF.&nbsp; If a violation is unable to be verified through the company concerned, the operators will activate SCDF's Enforcement Bikers and Police's Fast Response Cars, if necessary,&nbsp;to intercept the errant vehicle.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, whilst the tracking system can detect an errant hazmat vehicle, it cannot immobilise the vehicle to prevent a determined terrorist from driving it into a target.&nbsp; We now have plans to roll out the progressive installation of immobilisers on these hazmat vehicles that would enable SCDF to remotely activate them to stop the vehicles by shutting down the engine safely.&nbsp; We will implement this plan over a one-year period, starting from April this year.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs):</B>&nbsp; Sir, buprenorphine (which is the active ingredient in Subutex) was made a Class A controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act on 14th August 2006.&nbsp; Between 14th August 2006 and 31st December last year, CNB arrested a total of 347 persons for Subutex-related offences. Of these, 150 Subutex abusers were sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for treatment, 55 abusers were imprisoned under the Long Term Imprisonment regime, and 102 persons were sent to Prisons as they were found to have either trafficked or possessed the drug.&nbsp; As for the remaining 40 persons, 22 were given a warning and 18 are pending further investigations.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the implementation of tougher measures to counter Subutex abuse, I am happy to report that the situation has improved significantly.&nbsp; To prevent the influx of illicit supply of the drug, CNB is maintaining a watchful eye at the checkpoints as well as on the ground situation.&nbsp; CNB has not detected any signs of a black market emerging and the number of Subutex tablets seized monthly is not high.&nbsp; Between 14th August 2006&nbsp;and 31st August 2006, 512 Subutex tablets were seized.&nbsp; Although&nbsp; about 1,000 Subutex tablets were seized in September 2006, this is attributed to a single seizure of 884 Subutex tablets, which is the largest consignment seized so far.&nbsp; 319 tablets and 590 tablets were seized in October and November&nbsp;last year&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 940<p>respectively.&nbsp; In December 2006, only 79 tablets were seized.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feedback from the public also suggests that the Subutex abuse situation has improved.&nbsp; I am sure Members of Parliament who monitor the grounds&nbsp;will know this. Since September 2006, the monthly number of calls and other feedback from the public on Subutex abuse have&nbsp;declined.&nbsp; We believe that CNB's strong enforcement action has led to a decline in public concern over Subutex abuse.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CNB's intelligence indicates that, while it is likely that a small proportion of Subutex abusers may attempt to illicitly access the drug, the vast majority of ex-Subutex abusers have very likely managed to overcome their Subutex dependence. Thus, CNB's enforcement actions have helped to contain Subutex abuse. Nevertheless, CNB will continue to keep a close watch on the Subutex abuse situation and will press on with vigorous enforcement efforts to detect and deter illicit drug activities, taking firm action against both drug traffickers and abusers alike.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> &nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;since August 2006, based on the information released by the Central Narcotics Bureau on its website, it appears&nbsp;that there have been several operations in which&nbsp;significant amounts of heroin had been seized.&nbsp; And I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether he thinks it is possible that there has been a displacement effect from Subutex now that&nbsp;it is controlled and such abusers switching instead to heroin.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ng Eng Hen</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mdm Ho for her question.&nbsp; She is asking for two sets of situations.&nbsp; One set is for workers.&nbsp; In fact, she is quite right.&nbsp; The low-wage workers, if we increase the CPF for them, they would be more costly to employ and they might find problems in employability.&nbsp; If we increase, for example, the employees' CPF, obviously they will have less in take-home pay.&nbsp; I think that is why there is merit in NTUC's suggestion that, for this group of workers, we&nbsp;actually reduce both, and that is something we are seriously considering, ie, reduce the employees' CPF so that their take-home pay is increased, and reduce the employer's CPF so that they cost less to hire.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, then something has to be done if we did do that to match the reduction in CPF, and this is where Workfare comes in and this is an active area that we are consulting various agencies.&nbsp; For various companies, Mdm Ho is saying, \"Yes, some companies are doing well and there is a global demand for my goods, but certain companies that are looking at domestic demand may not be doing very well.\"&nbsp; And we agree that <p align=left>Column: 946<p>the CPF is a blunt tool.&nbsp; Even when we reduced it, there were companies that were doing well post-SARS.&nbsp; We recognise and, therefore, it is important to consider two general points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, that we should do it only when the economic forecast is sustained and projections are good.&nbsp; Two, the actual increase, if any, should be able to allow a majority of companies to respond to it, as well as to look at other budget measures which may be helpful to these companies which are usually the SMEs.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RETIREMENT SECURITY OF SINGAPOREANS--><p align=left>Column: 946<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RETIREMENT SECURITY OF SINGAPOREANS:::950--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, about four in ten active&nbsp;CPF members who turned 55 in 2005 met the Minimum Sum of $90,000.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason for this is that members were and are able to withdraw 50% of their CPF balances when they turn 55, before they set aside the Minimum Sum.&nbsp; In other words, previously we said, \"Even if you did not, you could withdraw an amount of your CPF.\"&nbsp; If we had not allowed that,&nbsp;60% of active members would have met this Minimum Sum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the reason why the Government had announced in 2003 that the Minimum Sum should be gradually increased, and the 50% withdrawal rule will be progressively phased out starting&nbsp;from 2009. These changes will help <p align=left>Column: 947<p>Singaporeans to set aside more funds for their retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides changing the withdrawal rules, the Government will help Singaporeans to enhance their retirement security in a number of other ways.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, the Government will help&nbsp;older Singaporeans keep their jobs and stay longer in their jobs so that they can&nbsp;earn more and put more into&nbsp;their CPF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we will find ways to help CPF members enhance the returns on their CPF savings.&nbsp; In February this year, the CPF Board has&nbsp;tightened the criteria for admitting funds into the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) in order to improve the quality of funds in CPFIS.&nbsp; In other words, we set out a number of criteria, both on&nbsp;expense ratios and fund loading charges as well as how they perform.&nbsp; So, we are using two levers.&nbsp; One is information, ie, to put out the information on how the funds perform.&nbsp; We rank them in terms of their expense ratios, as well as set benchmarks for how much they can charge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the CPF Board will continue to educate CPF members on ways to improve their retirement adequacy.&nbsp; We are working with market players to provide members with better information about their investments, educating members so that they can make informed investment decisions, providing online financial tools and reaching out to Singaporeans through seminars and road shows on the need for retirement funding.&nbsp; The most recent road show at the HDB Hub in September 2006 attracted 92,000 visitors.&nbsp; So Singaporeans are actively engaged, and I take it that they&nbsp;want to learn also how to plan their retirement.&nbsp; We will also&nbsp;work with the Housing and Development Board to encourage the prudent use by members of CPF for housing.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minimum Sum, as it is called, is the minimum sum, ie, minimum enough for substantial living and let me translate it into monetary terms.&nbsp; If we assume a 20-year lifespan from age 62,&nbsp;the&nbsp;average life expectancy now at age 62 for males is&nbsp;81 and that for&nbsp;females is 84.&nbsp;&nbsp;For females,&nbsp;84 minus 62 is 22 years.&nbsp;If we translate so many in dollar terms, ie, about $90,000 over 20 years, we get the amount.&nbsp; That is the&nbsp;amount that we&nbsp;think is adequate for subsistence living.&nbsp; That is why it is called the Minimum Sum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point which Mdm Halimah asked is whether we are considering a variety of plans to enhance the retirement savings for members and when the study would be completed.&nbsp; Sir, the study is on-going.&nbsp; But even as we are looking at various aspects, we have moved.&nbsp; Some of the changes the CPF Board has made&nbsp;in terms of tightening entry of funds and dictating maximum expense ratios were as a result of this study.&nbsp; There was a proposal put&nbsp; that the CPF Board should consider itself as an aggregating body to put out funds.&nbsp; That is a little bit more complex and it has taken us a while.&nbsp; We <p align=left>Column: 949<p>are still consulting various stakeholders.&nbsp; The issues are risk-tolerance and educating members, which the industry tells us is&nbsp;not that easy.&nbsp; No matter how much we educate members, some do make wrong decisions in investments.&nbsp; In any framework where we liberalise the investment framework, members must be willing to live with that risk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a third point, on the monetisation of assets.&nbsp; As the Prime Minister mentioned, the majority of Singaporeans have assets.&nbsp; Even the lowest 20% of households have a positive equity of $138,000.&nbsp; This is a significant asset that we can help them monetise and have an income stream.&nbsp; It is an added revenue for their retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for National Development is actively studying these options in terms of how we can provide options that allow our elderly to monetise.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ng Eng Hen</B>:&nbsp; Sir, as I mentioned, these are active suggestions that we are looking into.&nbsp; But we cannot run away from one cardinal principle on investing, ie, higher returns come with greater risks.&nbsp; So, if a member wants to put in his funds which may have a projected higher return, he has to live with the fact that he may also lose money in the short term.&nbsp; That is <p align=left>Column: 950<p>why the current framework, which pays 4% for the SA and the MA accounts, is risk-free, the Government bears the risks.&nbsp; Members, if they want to, for example, could invest in the CPFIS.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as our results show, about three-quarters of them do not make good investment decisions and&nbsp;fail to outperform CPF's interest rates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Lily Neo asked whether we should invest on behalf of members.&nbsp; That is a good suggestion. It allows us to aggregate the sums and reduce the expense ratio.&nbsp; But the problem we are still grappling with is one of investment risk.&nbsp; Even though I may do it cheaper for you, ie, at a lower amount, if the stocks go down and there is a loss of money, there is a risk that we will have to factor in.&nbsp; So, we are looking at all these issues.&nbsp; Currently, at the&nbsp;4% interest risk-free rate on SA and MA, I think it is quite reasonable, given the current conditions of the market.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) has been indeed one of the vehicles used to enhance Singaporeans' retirement security.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to please explain why the maximum contribution cap on the SRS declines each year instead of going the other way round?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ng Eng Hen</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is a very good question best answered by the Minister&nbsp;for Finance.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:INTEGRATED RESORTS--><p align=left>Column: 950<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:INTEGRATED RESORTS:::952--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>INTEGRATED RESORTS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Mechanisms to monitor work-in-progress--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Mechanisms to monitor work-in-progress)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; <B>Ms Lee Bee Wah</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in view of the large investments involved in, and the high profile of, the two Integrated Resorts (a) if mechanisms have been put in place to monitor the work-in-progress to ensure <p align=left>Column: 951<p>compliance with the contract awarded; (b) if he will provide an update on the work-in-progress with regard to these two projects; and (c) what recourse is there if the companies fail to meet their contractual obligations, such as completion deadlines.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the obligations of the Integrated Resort (IR) operators are clearly outlined in the Requests for Proposals and the Development Agreements.

A key concern facing our SMEs is the increase in global competition, especially from lower-cost competitors offering higher value-added activities.&nbsp; In this respect, we have various programmes, at both the industry and the enterprise level, to help our SMEs upgrade their capabilities and move up the value-chain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the industry level, we have the Local Enterprise and Association Development, or LEAD programme, which supports industry development efforts by able and willing industry associations.&nbsp; At the enterprise level, we have introduced the Capability Development Programme, which covers areas such as process improvement, strategic alliances, and certification of products and processes to international standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Companies can also leverage on the Technology Innovation Programme to strengthen their technology innovation capability and capacity. The programme provides SMEs with the expertise, infrastructure as well as the financial support for their research and other innovation related projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Financing</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area that we help our SMEs is in financing.&nbsp; Access to financing, as&nbsp;we all know, is a key concern of our SMEs.&nbsp; In 2005, we extended some $800 million worth of loans to more than 3,600 SMEs through the various schemes, such as the Local Enterprise Finance Scheme <p align=left>Column: 954<p>(LEFS), and the Micro Loan Programme.&nbsp; The Internationalisation Finance Scheme was launched this year, making available $500 million worth of loans for overseas expansion purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; To complement the loans, the Government has also made available equity financing, matching Government funds with private sector investments under the Start-up Enterprise Development Scheme (SEEDS) for innovative start-ups.&nbsp; The Business Angel Scheme was also introduced last year to spur the level of business angel investments in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are pleased that the private sector has recognised that not all SMEs are high-risk, and have introduced loans and services to cater particularly to the SME market.&nbsp; Several banks are even offering unsecured financing products to SMEs, in the form of instalment loans and revolving credit lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accessing overseas markets</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third area of&nbsp;concern for SMEs is access to overseas market opportunities.&nbsp; To build up these connections, SMEs can participate in outgoing missions and fairs as well as the various IE Singapore&rsquo;s networking platforms.&nbsp; Companies can also tap on the International Marketing Activities Programme which supports the activities organised by trade associations and chambers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote our enterprises to the world, we recently launched the BuySingapore portal.&nbsp; This initiative is a national e-channel that leverages on the established Singapore Brand to acquire and disseminate foreign business leads to our companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has put in place quite a comprehensive package of assistance to our&nbsp;SMEs.&nbsp; I assure Members that we will continue to improve and adapt our assistance as the needs of our SMEs evolve.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 955<p><B>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, one common feedback from the SMEs is the bewilderment over the sense of the many financing schemes that are available.&nbsp; I do not know&nbsp;if the Government is minded to put together all these schemes into one organisation.&nbsp; The Government has resisted the call for setting up an SME bank.&nbsp; I am wondering whether or not an alternative parallel organisation, which mirrors the functions of the bank and that supports these SMEs financially, in terms of the various schemes available, is something which the Government may consider.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; We have debated this many times.

These are areas which we will continue to look at to improve our processes.&nbsp; The very fact that 8% of our SMEs take up the LEFS scheme, to me, is a very good sign.&nbsp; First, the schemes are there. So if SMEs do not take them up, it does not necessarily mean a bad thing.&nbsp; But we will look into the take-up rates.&nbsp; It is not for lack of availability.&nbsp; The funds are there. There are also competing avenues for the SMEs.&nbsp; So it is not that they have to depend entirely on the Government for the LEFS scheme. The banks are coming in. We have an OTC market. There are many avenues.&nbsp; And it is good that our SMEs are self-reliant and they have their own financing resources.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Lee Bee Wah</B>:&nbsp; Sir, in view of the impending increase in&nbsp;CPF, does the Minister foresee that it will bring additional burden to the SMEs, in particular, now that&nbsp;the SMEs are also facing a steep increase in&nbsp;rental, labour cost, material cost, etc?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>:&nbsp; Again, let me thank the Member for raising this.

Mr Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge that it is not easy to match persons with disabilities with the right jobs. However, I am pleased to say that we have come a long way in facilitating the employment of persons with disabilities. In the past, persons with disabilities would be kept at home and not given the opportunity to work.&nbsp; Now, persons with disabilities are able to find meaningful employment. For example, today, Bizlink Centre, a central job placement agency funded by MCYS and the National Council for Social Service, manages to place about 250 Persons with Disabilities into open employment annually, while another 1,300 of them are finding employment in our sheltered workshops.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry firmly believes that employment is the best form of self reliance for the disabled and will encourage all persons with disability, who are work-capable, to seek employment. However, we recognise that people with disabilities do face difficulties in securing employment, not because they are incapable but because they are often not given the opportunity to demonstrate what they are capable of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why my Ministry worked with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency to set up the ENABLE Fund (Engaging Persons with Disabilities in Employment Fund) in July 2006. It aims <p align=left>Column: 961<p>to encourage employers to make that first step of employing people with disabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the process, these companies which employ people with disabilities will demonstrate that people with disabilities can also be contributing staff and they are employed not out of compassion, but based on their merit. This is what the disabled community is asking for too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ENABLE Fund is one of the many initiatives that my ministry has to encourage employment amongst persons with disabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;It complements the efforts of Bizlink, which also conducts vocational assessments and onsite job counselling or coaching after placement to help the employee with disability adjust to his new work environment. For example, Natural Cool Holdings, one of the companies that has tapped on ENABLE Fund, has utilised the grant to engage a training officer from Bizlink to coach its staff.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ENABLE fund is open to employers who are willing to hire four or more persons with disabilities. As at 15th January 2007, 14 companies have tapped on the fund, with 41 workers benefiting from it. There are another seven companies currently at different stages of discussion with the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF), which administers the ENABLE Fund.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the ENABLE Fund has just been launched, it is still too early to establish if the grant is sufficient. The Employment Sub-committee of the Enabling Masterplan is concurrently gathering feedback from the employers through focus group discussions on how to assist persons with disabilities in getting employment. The committee is a 3P effort, involving the people sector, the private sector and the public sector. In addition to voluntary welfare organisations, the sub-committee also has representatives from the National Trades Union Congress, the Singapore <p align=left>Column: 962<p>Workforce Development Agency, the Singapore National Employers' Federation, the Singapore Human Resource Institute, the Ministry of Manpower and several employers. These agencies are well placed to advise on the ENABLE Fund. If adjustment to the grant is necessary, the Enabling Masterplan Employment Sub-committee will make the appropriate recommendations to my Ministry.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, SNEF has been actively promoting the ENABLE Fund through marketing brochures and posters, and the distribution of marketing collaterals to SNEF member companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Disability Awareness and Public Education campaign has been launched in conjunction with the International Day of Disabled Persons on 3rd December last year.&nbsp; With greater awareness of the ENABLE Fund and public education on the abilities and productivity of persons with disabilities, I hope more companies will recognise the work value of people with disabilities and provide them jobs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State whether the Ministry is satisfied with only 14 companies and 41 workers benefiting from this Fund.

Our target is to attract one million foreign patients by 2012.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect the medical travel market to continue to expand as the middle class grows.&nbsp; The competition to be medical hubs will at the same time intensify.&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo mentioned Bangkok&rsquo;s Bumrungrad Hospital which was reported to have served about 400,000 foreign <p align=left>Column: 966<p>patients per year.&nbsp; But there are many more such competitors in Thailand, Malaysia and India.&nbsp; In due course, I am sure China too will move into this sector.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, patients from ASEAN countries account for about 70% of our international inpatient volume.&nbsp; We have begun to reach out to non-ASEAN countries, with encouraging results.&nbsp; There is a growing trend in patients arriving from further afield, including Russia, Bangladesh and the Middle East.&nbsp; These are new markets with significant potential.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To tap these opportunities, we need to increase our capacity, especially in manpower and hospital beds.&nbsp; We also need to raise our clinical capabilities and service standards so as to justify our higher cost premium.&nbsp;

So the key is&nbsp;to continue to expand our doctors and&nbsp;nurses.&nbsp; And capacity as well, in terms of physical beds.&nbsp; Right now, I really see a need for at least one or two private hospitals to come up, and I am working very closely with URA to release land for this purpose.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Though English will remain as the common working language for Singaporeans, there is room for greater use of dual or multiple languages in our Parliament when national issues are debated, so that Singaporeans of all races and all generations can be engaged on these issues.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allowing Members a greater opportunity to use mother tongues in this House will not only make for more effective debate, especially when the issues can be better expressed in their own language context, but will also allow the House to reflect the multi-racial and multi-lingual heritage of Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with this, there will be changes made to the Official Reports of the Parliamentary Debates to incorporate the written transcripts of mother tongue speeches, for public record and access.

This is in line with Government's policy to allow more people to understand the broad directions of our policy.&nbsp; This is most beneficial.&nbsp; So I personally fully support this proposal to allow the MPs to use one or more of the official languages.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the last&nbsp;sitting of Parliament in November 2006, PM suggested that the MPs be allowed to switch to the other official languages in their speeches.&nbsp; This proposal was moved by the Leader of the House and approved by Parliament.&nbsp; Almost all of us are in favour.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the suspension of Standing Order was an ad hoc measure that allowed the MPs to use more than one language in a speech, only during that particular sitting.&nbsp; This is not good enough.&nbsp; When many of my MP colleagues knew that the Deputy Leader was going to move this motion to allow MPs to use multiple languages in one speech once and for all, all showed support and enthusiasm.&nbsp; On behalf of all my parliamentary colleagues, I would like to thank the PM for his suggestion and the Deputy Leader for moving this motion.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a multi-racial country and I would like to express my thanks in all the four official languages.&nbsp; In English, we say, \"Thank you\".&nbsp; In Malay, we say, \"Terima kasih\".&nbsp; In Tamil, we say, \"Nandri.\"&nbsp; In Mandarin, we say, \"Xie xie\".</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 973<p>Sir, I support the motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 1101-1102.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.12 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion raised by the Deputy Leader of the House.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore language policy has always included a promotion of bilingualism, mastering English as a language for commerce, education and also administration, and certainly using Mandarin as a unifying language for the Chinese community.&nbsp; Passing this motion would be in line with the promotion of our cultural and lingual diversity in a multi-racial, multi-cultural and multi-lingual society.&nbsp; We, Members of the House, leaders in our community, must set the example and spearhead the efforts in Parliament.&nbsp; We shape our language and certainly our language shapes us as well. Using our mother tongues in our speeches will enable a greater connection with members of our community, especially those who do not understand and speak English.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the General Household Survey of 2005, for example, about 24% of Chinese households do not use English at all and we have a relatively similar number for Malay households as well.&nbsp; These are exactly the segment we will be reaching out to with this new policy.&nbsp; They will now be able to connect better with their Members in Parliament and follow and support their speeches closely. With a language familiar to them, they will be more at home, and we certainly cannot deny that certain issues when discussed and spoken of in a certain language can create and generate more emotions, greater passion and also impact than when stated in English. This is a known phenomenon and may be related to the way our brains&nbsp;encode messages and information in the limbic system.&nbsp; It is also human nature to click and connect with those with similarities to you and <p align=left>Column: 974<p>particularly those who speak and understand the same language.&nbsp; When we speak at our election rallies, we used a combination of languages.&nbsp; And it is timely indeed for this practice to be extended to this House.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is small in size but big on languages.&nbsp; This was reported as early as 1991 in the <I>Business Times</I> of 15th November and our parliamentary Chamber will now be&nbsp;more of a linguistic stage with diversity in languages co-existing in a very dynamic way, reflecting our national integration.&nbsp; It will also emphasise the conservation of our mother tongue and indeed a very positive step in fostering further rootedness among Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are already many other nations that have adopted the dual or multilingualism policy, and these would include Scotland, Malta, Wales, Canada and Hungary, just to name a few.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Mr Low Thia Khiang was asking me whether I was supporting the use of Punjabi.&nbsp; It is not an official language, but I understand Malay quite well.&nbsp; I studied it until my A-levels.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I notice in the past that Members, in making their speeches, some of them felt quite constrained when they were forced to use just one language to deliver their speeches.&nbsp; Some Members were effectively Mandarin-speaking, and when they deliver their English speeches because they had to deliver speeches in English, they felt a bit uncomfortable.&nbsp; Similarly, those who were English-speaking and wanted to deliver&nbsp;Mandarin or Malay speeches, I could also sense an uneasiness when they delivered their speeches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, if we had that flexibility in the past, I am sure Members would have delivered certain portions of their speeches in English and certain portions in their mother tongue and, therefore, making their delivery a bit&nbsp;neater and more interesting&nbsp;to listen to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, more Members are bilingual and equally comfortable in both English and their mother tongue.&nbsp; So, I think we should not restrict them if they feel comfortable in making their speeches in any of the official languages that they choose to.&nbsp; We have a very efficient translation service in Parliament.&nbsp; So I do not foresee any reduction in understanding when Members switch their speeches from one language to <p align=left>Column: 976<p>another.&nbsp; Therefore, Members of this House should not feel that we will not be able to follow the speeches if the switch is made.&nbsp; Of course, I do not see any Member in this House speaking in all the four official languages.&nbsp; But if Dr Vasoo was still in this House, perhaps he may have been the one that could have delivered in all four languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I did ask a number of my grassroots leaders, some friends and also a few residents that I met, and every one of them told me that they actually liked the flexibility that they saw during the debate on the President's Address.&nbsp; Many of them told me that it added colour to the debate.&nbsp; As I said, I myself studied Malay as my second language.&nbsp; I enjoyed the speeches&nbsp; that were made in both languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Over the past few years, MAS has progressively liberalised the banking sector.&nbsp; At the same time, MAS has also sought to implement a risk-based supervisory approach that moves away from the one-size-fits-all rules and allows for well-managed risk-taking.&nbsp; The measures have resulted in more choices for consumers, new innovative products and competitive pricing.&nbsp; With the free play of market forces and the growing complexity and international nature of banking businesses, there will also be new risks to be addressed.&nbsp; For example, depositors are now increasingly exposed to the risks of both local and foreign banks&rsquo; expanding international operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS continuously reviews and refines its regulatory framework to ensure that it is robust and responsive, without adding undue burden and cost to the industry; a framework that upholds prudential standards and the interests of depositors, while fostering the growth of the sector.&nbsp; The Banking (Amendment) Bill is part of this on-going process.&nbsp; It introduces <p align=left>Column: 978<p>several new policies and measures to strengthen prudential standards, facilitate risk-based supervision and provide banks with greater operational flexibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In preparing this Bill, MAS has consulted extensively with the industry and the public on the policy changes and the draft Bill.&nbsp; The feedback received was carefully considered, and incorporated into the Bill where practicable and consonant with its regulatory objectives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the major amendments in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Strengthening prudential safeguards</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first set of amendments is to strengthen the prudential safeguards.&nbsp; On this, I would elaborate on three main amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, is the revision of methodologies for limiting large exposures and related party exposures.&nbsp; Currently, section 29 of the Banking Act sets prudential limits on credit facilities extended by banks to a single borrower or a group of related borrowers.&nbsp; It also curtails unsecured credit facilities to parties related to the bank.&nbsp; These prevent the default of any single borrower from seriously impacting the financial strength of a bank.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS is introducing a number of changes to ensure that the prudential limits remain relevant and are in line with international best practice.&nbsp; First, instead of a limit based on credit facilities granted, the Bill introduces a more comprehensive measure based on exposures, which would include a bank&rsquo;s equity investment in, as well as other transactions with a counterparty.&nbsp; The second key change is that MAS will recognise a bank&rsquo;s efforts in mitigating risks, by allowing the bank to offset its exposures where these are secured by qualifying collateral, or to substitute its exposures to a counterparty with that of a <p align=left>Column: 979<p>credit protection provider of good rating.&nbsp; To reduce the risk of contagion and non-arm&rsquo;s length transactions between a bank and a related party, the current limit on unsecured lending to related corporations will be widened to restrict the exposures of a bank incorporated in Singapore to its substantial shareholder groups, and exposures of a bank in Singapore to entities in which the bank holds a major stake.&nbsp; The industry will be given a two-year grace period to make the appropriate adjustments for compliance with the revised section 29.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Introduction of an asset maintenance regime</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS&rsquo; liberalisation measures in the last few years have brought about greater foreign bank participation in our banking sector.&nbsp; While the competition has added to the dynamism of the banking sector, the banking system will increasingly be exposed to risks arising from the foreign banks&rsquo; international operations.&nbsp; Should a foreign bank fail, the resolution of a cross-border bank insolvency will be complex and drawn-out.&nbsp; The claims of depositors and creditors will be subject to substantial uncertainty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The revised section 40 aims to strengthen the foreign bank regulatory framework by requiring foreign full and wholesale bank branches to maintain a minimum level of eligible assets in Singapore in proportion to their deposit liabilities.&nbsp; This would help to improve the recovery of assets from a failed foreign bank branch in Singapore to meet the claims of Singaporean depositors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The asset maintenance requirement has been carefully calibrated to balance prudential objectives with the banks&rsquo; commercial interests, and determined after close consultation with the industry.&nbsp; A six-month grace period will also be <p align=left>Column: 980<p>given, for foreign bank branches to make necessary adjustments to their asset allocations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment of the priority ranking of deposit liabilities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, both non-bank and inter-bank deposit liabilities of a bank rank ahead of other unsecured liabilities in the event of a winding up of a bank.&nbsp; In recognition that non-bank depositors are likely to be less well informed than banks and in greater need of protection, the Bill reorders the priority ranking under section 62 and places all non-bank deposit liabilities of a bank ahead of inter-bank liabilities, with the latter ranking <I>pari passu</I> with other unsecured creditors.&nbsp; This is consistent with the objective of protecting non-bank depositors and encouraging banks to exercise prudence and market discipline in respect of exposures to their bank counterparties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancing MAS&rsquo; role in bank resolution</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next set of amendments is with regard to MAS' role in bank resolution.&nbsp; While MAS seeks to promote and preserve stability in the financial system through high standards of licensing, regulation and supervision, like many reputable regulators, it does not aim to prevent the failures of all financial institutions.&nbsp; Such a \"zero-failure\" regime is neither feasible nor desirable as it leads to considerable moral hazard for the regulator and places an excessive regulatory burden on our financial institutions.&nbsp; When dealing with a bank in distress or insolvency, a private sector resolution option is often preferred by regulators, but in the event that this is not possible, international experience has shown that it is important for the regulator to be able to take action quickly to minimise losses to depositors and other creditors, and to maintain stability in the entire financial system.&nbsp; The Bill will accord MAS a wider role in the resolution <p align=left>Column: 981<p>process and a broader range of resolution options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, the new section 54A provides MAS the right to be heard in insolvency proceedings of a bank and the power to approve the appointed liquidator.&nbsp; Part VIIA introduced by the Bill also empowers MAS, with the approval of the Minister in charge of MAS, to direct the sale of the business of a bank and in the case of a bank incorporated in Singapore, to require the issuance of new shares, to restructure the share capital or to sell existing shares to other investors.&nbsp; Before it can exercise these powers, MAS has to consider the interests of depositors of both the transferor and transferee, as well as the stability of the financial system in Singapore.&nbsp; The affected parties will be given a right to be heard prior to the Minister&rsquo;s approval of such a transfer, except where it is not practicable or desirable to do so, for instance, where an expeditious transfer is crucial in maintaining financial system stability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Facilitating risk-based supervision and allowing operational flexibility of banks</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to how the amendments will facilitate risk-based supervision and allowing operational flexibility of our banks.&nbsp; Consistent with the risk-based supervisory approach</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>adopted by MAS, the Bill will allow the calibration of prudential requirements according to an individual bank's financial strength, its risk profile and its risk management capabilities.&nbsp; Let me provide a few examples.&nbsp; The revised section 29 allows MAS to raise the large exposure limits for individual banks where there are strong justifications.&nbsp; Under section 40, a higher asset maintenance requirement may be imposed on banks that pose greater supervisory concerns.&nbsp; The amended section 38 will allow banks the operational flexibility to draw down their liquidity reserves to deal with liquidity stress situations.&nbsp; In addition, in view of <p align=left>Column: 982<p>the industry's need to move nimbly in a fast-paced environment, the new section 76A will allow MAS to grant exemptions from requirements in the Act in specific situations&nbsp;where the prudential objectives are not compromised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current regime, only banks and non-bank financial institutions are subject to MAS' rules on the issuance of credit cards.&nbsp;The new Part VIII extends MAS' regulatory scope to all issuers targeting the Singapore market and not just banks and financial institutions. Entities that have not been approved to issue credit cards in Singapore will be prohibited from soliciting for or accepting card applications in Singapore, and this applies equally to third parties acting on their behalf.&nbsp; MAS will be empowered to inspect the operations of approved credit card issuers for compliance with MAS&rsquo; rules pertaining to credit card operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed regime also clarifies that single party merchant credit is exempted from regulation.&nbsp; Such an arrangement, where the card is really used only for transactions with the issuer, is essentially a deferred payment scheme offered by merchants to their customers.&nbsp; In addition, a new exemption for cards granting credit in small amounts not exceeding $500 will be introduced.&nbsp; This allows flexibility in payments for small-ticket items without raising substantial concerns about Singaporeans spending beyond their means.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me now turn to the other&nbsp;amendments that are needed to update the banking regulatory framework:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(a)&nbsp; Section 22, which requires a bank to maintain a reserve fund. This will&nbsp;be repealed in light of enhancements to MAS' regulatory framework over the years, and the banks will be allowed to release their reserves over a five-year period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 983<p>(b)&nbsp; Section 5, which restricts the use of the word \"bank\" to protect consumers from being misled as to the status of the entity they are dealing with, will be amended to accommodate legitimate uses of the word, such as representative offices of foreign banks; international financial institutions like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank;&nbsp;and where it is used in a non-financial sense, such as \"Blood Bank\" and&nbsp;\"Infobank\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendment to section 4B will provide flexibility for MAS to exclude or include any financial product from or in the definition of \"deposit\".&nbsp; This is necessary to facilitate MAS&rsquo; response to innovative products that either legally satisfy the definition of \"deposit\" but do not meet the economic characteristics of a deposit, or conversely meet the economic characteristics of a deposit but do not satisfy the legal definition of \"deposit\".&nbsp; An example of the latter is a <I>murabaha</I> investment&nbsp;- an Islamic variant of a time deposit.&nbsp; Products that are prescribed as deposits will be accorded priority ranking in the event of a bank winding-up and protection under the deposit insurance scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; The amendments to section 26 will permit MAS to disclose only non-customer information provided by banks to MAS under limited circumstances, such as for the purpose of sharing aggregate information at international fora and contributing to research projects.&nbsp; This is to balance MAS' responsibility for surveillance and supervision of the financial sector with its commitment to preserve the confidentiality of individual banks' information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e)&nbsp; To underscore the importance of accurate reporting of information to MAS, section 66 will be amended to extend the obligation&nbsp;- currently imposed on directors and executive officers&nbsp;- to any <p align=left>Column: 984<p>person who furnishes information to MAS to exercise due care in ensuring that the information is&nbsp;not false or misleading.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f)&nbsp; Finally, the new section 54B will explicitly provide MAS with the powers to direct the removal of directors from the board of a Singapore-incorporated bank, if these persons fail to perform their duties and functions, to protect public interest and depositors.&nbsp; This is in line with international standards and the practices in reputable jurisdictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, a sound and vibrant financial sector is an integral part of ensuring the success and resilience of the Singapore economy.&nbsp; These amendments to the Banking Act are part of an on-going process to enhance the robustness and responsiveness of our banking regulatory framework, in tandem with the growth in scope and sophistication of the activities of the banks in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>3.37 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Inderjit Singh:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the proposed amendments in the Bill.&nbsp; The Bill is definitely a step in the right direction when we consider Singapore's efforts to become a major world financial centre.&nbsp; I have comments on six areas of the proposed amendments to the Banking Act, as follows:<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first comment is on section 4B.&nbsp; The Bill proposes widening the possible definition of \"deposit\" in section 4B.&nbsp; This is a positive development and I welcome it.&nbsp; Sir, there is a trend of capital movement from the west to the east, particularly from the Middle East.&nbsp; We need to be ready for this expected surge in capital, including that from the Arab <p align=left>Column: 985<p>world, where many are owners of the capital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that the banks will take up the challenge to devise new, <I>Syariah</I> -compliant financial instruments, including deposits, that will give these owners options to invest their capital here.&nbsp; Additionally, Islamic banking instruments may also appeal to a wider population, as has been&nbsp;experienced elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that we may even need to go further because now is the right time for Singapore to position itself as the key centre outside the Arab world for Islamic banking.&nbsp; I was hoping to see more done to make Islamic banking a reality in Singapore.&nbsp; MAS therefore should form a focus Committee or workgroup to seriously develop Islamic banking options in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, the widening definition of \"deposit\" may catch some consumers unaware as they may view some products as principal-guaranteed when they may involve hidden risks or costs. What restrictions exist or are proposed to prevent the introduction and marketing of such products and, in particular, of them being labelled as straightforward \"deposits\"?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second comment is on section 22 which is the abolishment of the reserve fund.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how the reserve fund is presently maintained and whether the repeal of the requirement is expected to lead to an outflow of capital from Singapore.&nbsp; If so, will this not lead to excess supply of Singapore dollars on the market and lead to a risk of fluctuation in the currency value?&nbsp; Especially at a time when the US dollar is in a trough, it may not be wise to risk any fluctuation that we can avoid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third comment is on the prudential safeguards on the proposed amendments to sections 27 to 29 of the <p align=left>Column: 986<p>Act, I note that these amendments will likely involve some dislocation of certain parties, but that it will make for a stronger industry as a whole where the risks are acceptably spread out by the banks. This will also benefit consumers by giving them greater assurance of the stability of the banks where they entrust their money to.&nbsp; I welcome, in particular, the shift to an exposure-based regime of disclosure. What this change means is that banks that have large exposure to groups of related entities will have to scale back on this exposure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in the case of DBS Bank, which has large exposure to Government-linked companies (GLCs) in terms of supporting their financing requirements, I think that the proposed amendments will provide an impetus for a few things:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, DBS will have to source elsewhere for business&nbsp;that it may have to forgo as a result of the Bill. This is a good opportunity for them to exploit other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, it will also make DBS (and other such banks) more open to innovative funding arrangements, especially funding more SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GLCs will also have to source funding on market-driven principles, having to satisfy lenders not linked to the Government that they are viable credit risks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically, could the Minister enlighten us as to whether Temasek, which is a core part of Singapore's investment strategy, will face any significant challenges because of the proposed amendments since many of its related entities bank with DBS and Temasek also owns DBS?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MAS' ability to exempt certain banks or categories of banks from operation of these limits in its prudential safeguards, which is in section 29(3), is potentially sensitive, especially if it works <p align=left>Column: 987<p>in favour of local banks.&nbsp; I suggest that this be taken into consideration before any exemptions are made, which must be well-considered and judiciously made.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the disclosure requirement itself in section 27(1) of the Act as proposed, it would require a statement on exposure by&nbsp;banks in Singapore. Checking on this looks like a difficult task for MAS.&nbsp; In the case of foreign banks, their exposure may be spread wider geographically than local banks.&nbsp; Has the feasibility of checking on compliance been considered by the Minister and MAS?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, some of this disclosure may involve clearance from regulatory authorities overseas due to their banking secrecy Act, for example, in the case of disclosures that involve exposure to banks or customers of banks overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, local banks are required to include their Asian Currency Units (ACUs) exposure in their calculations while foreign banks operating ACUs are presently exempted from this by reason of the transitional provision in clause 67(9)&nbsp;of the Bill.&nbsp; There may be a disproportionate impact on the numbers reported by local banks because of this.&nbsp; I hope that we are not unwittingly imposing more difficult conditions on local banks that would favour&nbsp;foreign banks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth comment is on sections 38 to 40, which are on the asset maintenance regime.&nbsp; I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the proposed amendment to section 38 which concerns minimum liquid assets, the Bill contains new powers for MAS to deal with banks in relation to a minimum liquidity required, especially for liquidity stress situations. This is, of course, good for the consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 988<p>The Bill, however, also changes the period for altering the minimum liquidity to three days, instead of the previous one month, under section 38(3).&nbsp; MAS has clarified that, in practice, it will continue to act in consultation with industry, and the three-day period for altering the minimum liquidity will only be used exceptionally.&nbsp; If this is the case, why is there a need to reduce the statutory period for compliance to three days?&nbsp; Why not instead stick with a longer limit, while providing for a shorter limit to be no less than three days?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the three-day limit in the provision could seem very onerous for financial institutions.&nbsp; Hence, it may work against the long-term aim of making Singapore a financial hub.&nbsp; I therefore suggest that&nbsp;a ministerial check be written in as a safeguard for invoking this minimum period which means that we should not do it at the very first instance.&nbsp; Can this check be introduced in the Act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In section 39 as proposed, and this concerns minimum cash balances, this provides flexibility to MAS to deal with different banks differently.&nbsp; In my opinion, this is also a good idea.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, the financial penalty provided for in&nbsp;section 39(7) should be provided for in the Act itself instead of being left to subsidiary legislation.&nbsp; Is there a good reason why it is removed from this Act?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in section 40, which covers the asset maintenance requirements and the related sections 49 to 55, which concern certain powers of MAS, could the Minister please enlighten the House on how other major financial centres handle such asset maintenance?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even the best of regulations cannot totally rule out flight risk of capital when banks are in stress. What is the experience of other jurisdictions in reducing flight risk of capital on impending <p align=left>Column: 989<p>insolvency and how can the chances be minimised in Singapore? What are the lessons learnt from other areas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the powers of MAS to step in and manage the affairs of banks in or approaching insolvency, what is the role of MAS when it moves in to control a bank as provided for in this Act? What are its objectives when it takes over the running of the operations of such an insolvent bank?&nbsp; Will the current insolvency procedures, applicable for all companies, not be sufficient? Why the need for these additional changes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my fifth comment is on section 62, which concerns the priority ranking of depositors. The proposal to put non-bank depositors ahead of bank depositors is a welcome move as it will provide protection to the less sophisticated depositors. Could the Minister clarify whether&nbsp;it is expected that there may be a move by some banks to concentrate their deposits in other banks that do not accept significant deposits from non-bank depositors?&nbsp; This is so that they can avoid being pushed back in the queue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth comment is on sections 57 to 57G which are on credit cards and credit.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a welcome move and we have seen many of our residents, who have been in this downward spiral of debt.&nbsp; In extreme cases,&nbsp;people borrow from one credit card company using one facility to service debt taken from another facility at a very punishing interest rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly run out of options and face a mountain of debt and also bankruptcy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I therefore welcome the tightening of the rules that control credit card issuance and the extension of credit.&nbsp; Sir, I have a few questions for the Minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, the proposed section 57(3) would catch advertisers, especially since section 57(8)(c) (not knowing that advertisement would breach the law) is <p align=left>Column: 990<p>difficult to apply, in my opinion.&nbsp; Can this be revoked to provide effective protection for advertising agencies when they have to apply this?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In section 57D(1), this gives the power to issue directions but subsection 4 provides for high fines for violations.&nbsp; Subsection (2) also provides that the directions are not subsidiary legislation. The combined effect of sections 57D(2) and (4) blurs the line between subsidiary legislation and directions. For subsidiary legislation, there is an obligation to publish it in the <I>Gazette</I>, so we cannot say that ignorance of the law is no excuse.&nbsp; Is it not more appropriate to have the directions instead published as subsidiary legislation?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards section 57E, there is no provision for informing the public upon revocation of a licence.&nbsp; There is also no requirement for a licensee whose licence is revoked to notify at least their ex-customers.&nbsp; Further, subsection (2), requiring the licensee to prevent the use of cards after the licence is revoked, is likely to be practically unworkable and may be difficult to comply with.&nbsp; Subsection 3, while preserving transactions that took place before revocation, says nothing about transactions that took place after revocation. There is potential impact on third parties that has to be addressed. Can this section, therefore, be revoked to take this situation into account?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the Government's policy on mass-providers of credit to lower income groups that are usually&nbsp; targeted&nbsp;with credit cards (ie, those earning income below $30,000)?&nbsp; For example, we have seen extensive advertising over the last year of lending of smaller amounts by a commercial credit provider that is not subject to the Banking Act.&nbsp; Advertisements for such credit are plastered all over MRT stations, taxis, among other places.&nbsp; Will this likely affect the market <p align=left>Column: 991<p>estimates on the credit and default and indebtedness problems arising&nbsp;from over-borrowing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do we want the Banking Act to be the only legislation governing mass-providers of credit?&nbsp; If so, what other changes would be necessary to other legislation, for example, the Moneylenders Act (Cap. 188)?&nbsp; Can we bring both of these Acts, or at least the institutions licensed under&nbsp;them, under the same monitoring agency to provide for better control of their activities?&nbsp; So, credit card debt is, therefore, not the only problem.&nbsp; It is the other type of debt that may exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, this being a very technical Bill which is difficult to understand, but I managed to understand most of it, I hope that the Minister can clarify the points I have raised.&nbsp; But, overall, I think this is a good Bill and I support the amendments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.46 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments are comprehensive and will empower MAS to better manage the new dynamics of the banking sector in the years to come.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only one comment on the Bill. This relates to credit card advertisements and promotions by banks, section 56, subsection 5 (page 68).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do Net advertisements or solicitations come under this section, if a foreign bank originates it outside Singapore but intended for a Singapore audience, or as part of a regional marketing exercise of which Singapore is one target market?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Internet is still very much a grey area that transcends territoriality. Is it possible to develop more granular controls on Net advertisements and promotions?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 992<p>Sir, I also have a number of other issues to raise relating to the development of the banking sector in Singapore.&nbsp; Unlike Mr Inderjit who has digested the technicalities, I am raising another perspective.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first relates to developments in credit card technology.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have seen recent cases of credit card skimming&nbsp; and credit card fraud perpetrated by foreigners, precisely because we use magnetic-striped cards. The continued targeting of Singapore by these fraudsters may undermine our reputation as a trusted financial hub.&nbsp; On the other hand, credit cards with embedded microchips have reduced card fraud by as much as 80% in countries like France.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances, I would like to ask if MAS would mandate the adoption of EMV microchip technology to replace magnetic stripe-based cards.&nbsp; I understand this may be a costly exercise for banks. But I would like to argue that the cost is worth our reputation as a trusted financial hub, as well as for the reputation of the banks themselves.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question concerns two-factor authentication. MAS has mandated that local banks adopt two-factor authentication (2FA) to provide stronger security for e-banking. But feedback by bank customers indicates that it may be inconvenient for them to carry multiple tokens for different bank accounts.&nbsp; I would like to ask if there is a better alternative that provides more convenience but does not sacrifice the added security.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next question is about phishing or anti-phishing.&nbsp; Phishing is becoming more rampant around the world. Security experts tell us that phishing attempts are moving away from the USA and Europe to the Far East. Singapore banks have also <p align=left>Column: 993<p>been the targets of phishing attacks in the past.&nbsp; One reason why phishing continues unabated is because phishing sites are often located in servers in third countries where banking laws are not so strict. Many security experts believe the answer lies in more effective inter-governmental collaboration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of this, I would like to ask: What are the prospects for increased inter-governmental cooperation in combating phishing? What are the prospects and challenges for a global or inter-governmental agreement in combating phishing and similar crimes?<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one issue that crops up regularly among SMEs is the need for a SME Bank.&nbsp; As business organisations, banks naturally gravitate towards higher-yield activities. This, coupled with more stringent banking controls, may make financing for SMEs less attractive. SMEs, on the other hand, need a good source of funding to help them grow and regionalise. According to the 2006 SME Development Survey, a good 40% of SMEs depend on overdrafts as their main source of short-term funding. This is an expensive option for them.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the situation has improved slightly in the past three years, the financing structure for SMEs has not changed at all. Overdrafts remain their main source of short-term funding (40%), followed by trade financing (32%), term loans (27%) and factoring (7%).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, less than one in three SMEs (27%) are able to secure loans to finance their growth. Clearly, this structure needs to be corrected.&nbsp; Can MAS look into the feasibility of an SME Bank to assist SMEs finance their growth and to go regional? The SME Bank can provide a wide range of financing options designed for SMEs and on more competitive terms. This will, in turn, help our SMEs to become more <p align=left>Column: 994<p>competitive in their markets.&nbsp; The SME Bank can also provide first- or second-round funding for start-up companies, thus supporting our drive towards greater entrepreneurship.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe such a bank can be viable financially. More importantly, it can provide the much-needed impetus to help our SMEs grow and expand regionally.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my final comment relates to the marketing of financial products. We all know that banks do not make much money by accepting deposits. They do make money by selling their depositors additional products such as unit trusts, insurance policies or structured deposits.&nbsp; In the case of structured deposits or investment products, customers are not made aware of the many and often substantial hidden costs in these products. While they are promised protection of their principal sums, many of the management costs of these products are often deducted upfront. So, in cases where the returns on these products are minimal, depositors may actually lose part of their principal.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In light of this, banks must demonstrate greater transparency by advising their customers of the hidden costs of these products.&nbsp; A related area of concern is the way banks target specific customers who have deposits of a certain size. This clearly violates the privacy of the customer. Banks have obviously made use of privileged customer information to target their customers for cross-selling. Do customers have any safeguards to protect their information? MAS should mandate that banks do not use confidential customer information for any other purpose than normal transaction and communications.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS can also require banks to put up prominent warning labels to alert customers that there are risks attached to <p align=left>Column: 995<p>these &lsquo;safe&rsquo; investments.&nbsp; This is similar to the warning labels put on cigarette packs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe these are major issues that will require the attention of MAS to further strengthen Singapore&rsquo;s position as a trusted financial hub and banking centre.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on these, I rise in support of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo, who obviously have mastered the amendments very comprehensively and have suggested many comments and&nbsp;improvements.&nbsp; I believe Mr Inderjit Singh raised six points and Mdm Ho raised four.&nbsp; So there are 10 points altogether.&nbsp; I hope Members would bear with me as I go through these points.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Mr Inderjit Singh talked about Middle-Eastern funds and the definition of deposits.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that we have to deepen our engagement with the Middle East and attract Middle-Eastern funds into Singapore.&nbsp; Our aim is not so much to become a centre for Islamic finance but to build upon our existing strength as an international financial centre.&nbsp; In this regard, we are working with the industry to ensure we have a full suite of financial products and services, including Islamic products and services.&nbsp; We have been reviewing our legislative framework to ensure what we have is conducive to all these new Islamic financial products.&nbsp; Our approach has also been to level the playing field, ensure the neutrality of rules so that anybody coming up with innovative Islamic financial products will not find that they are operating against regulations which are not in their favour.&nbsp; So the neutrality of rules will therefore apply to both conventional and Islamic products and services wherever possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 996<p> Mr Inderjit Singh suggested a Committee to address this.&nbsp; I think this is a good point.&nbsp; In fact, MAS has been working with industry players to tap the views of all the players as to how to develop their products and to make sure we are able to engage the Middle East and to be a player in Islamic finance.&nbsp; So I agree that MAS will continue to deepen its engagement with the industry players.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of definition of deposits, I recognise that consumers sometimes may be confused whether what they are buying into or what they put into is essentially a deposit or not.&nbsp; That is the reason why we have some of these amendments.&nbsp; Let me clarify that we are not widening the definition or the scope of a deposit.&nbsp; What we are seeking to amend the Act is to allow the MAS to recognise certain products that meet the economic substance of a deposit, ie, that the principal is guaranteed but does not quite satisfy the legal definition of a deposit.&nbsp; Some of these products relate to the Islamic financial products.&nbsp; By clarifying the definition, I think it makes it better for us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mr Inderjit Singh refers to complex deposits, I suppose he is probably referring to structured deposits.&nbsp; Some of these products are advertised as deposits but they have features which require you to take a risk on your deposits.&nbsp; All structured deposits are, in fact, currently subject to higher product disclosure requirements, as set out in the Financial Advisers Act.&nbsp; These are the guidelines on structured deposits.&nbsp; This is to ensure that people who buy into such products know what they are buying into and they know that this is not a straightforward deposit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point which Mr Inderjit Singh raised is the outflow from the reserve fund and its impact on the Singapore dollar and the flow of funds out of Singapore.&nbsp; Let me explain that the <p align=left>Column: 997<p>reserve fund is essentially the retained earnings that belong to the shareholders.&nbsp; This has been kept under section 22, and this was intended to raise the reserve requirements for the banks</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>as they build up&nbsp;their reserve requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 22 previously, the banks were not allowed to distribute to their shareholders.&nbsp; There is now no longer this requirement to maintain the reserve fund and in fact we do not require the fund to be maintained in any particular form of asset.&nbsp; So with the repeal of section 22, and we allow this to be done over five years, we do not foresee any difficulties that Mr Inderjit Singh pointed out that there will be this huge outflow of funds affecting the Singapore dollar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next area that Mr Inderjit Singh raised is regarding the prudential safeguards, particularly the large exposure limits.&nbsp; Let me assure the House and Mr Inderjit Singh that MAS has conducted several consultations with the industry on the revised framework and we do not expect the banks to have any significant difficulty complying with these new rules.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, we still have a two-year transition period for the banks to modify their systems and to make the necessary preparations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether the exemptions are necessary.&nbsp; Essentially, we need to strike a balance between setting out the requirements in a very transparent and&nbsp;stringent manner as well as giving MAS the flexibility to deal with the situation as it arises.&nbsp; So it is this flexibility that MAS needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially in situations of restructuring or in a resolution of a bank failure, MAS needs some of these exemptions to give it the flexibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh cautioned that MAS' &nbsp;use of such exemption powers may be seen to be based on MAS own requirements and may not be seen to be <p align=left>Column: 998<p>transparent.&nbsp; So I think we have to strike a balance.&nbsp; Let me assure Mr Inderjit Singh that the exemption power does not relieve MAS of its duty to ensure that when it exercises such powers, it exercises it on good defensible grounds and where there are strong prudential justifications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh also asked about the regulation of foreign banks and how the exemption of exposures booked in the ACU of a bank incorporated outside Singapore&nbsp;would present problems with us.&nbsp; We have to work closely with our counterparts in other jurisdictions, just as we regulate or&nbsp;supervise the branches of foreign banks here.&nbsp; Similarly, our counterparts in other countries would also supervise or regulate the branches of Singapore banks.&nbsp; This close regulation and&nbsp;cooperation between regulators&nbsp;will allow us to make sure that the regulations cover across borders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth area is the minimum liquid asset and the asset maintenance requirements.&nbsp; Basically, what we are confronted here with is the problem of maintaining liquidity when there is a stress on the banks.&nbsp; Liquidity risk is a critical risk for the banks and, in normal circumstances, of course, the liquidity requirements of a bank for its day-to-day operations can be reasonably anticipated, and the MAS has no reason to make any sudden changes to the minimum liquidity requirements.&nbsp; The three-day grace period that we are seeking for really only addresses when there&nbsp;is severe adverse liquidity position of a bank.&nbsp; We will only impose this after careful assessment of the situation.&nbsp; A bank which has insufficient liquidity to make its claims can very quickly accelerate into a crisis of confidence and bring down the bank.&nbsp; And if the MAS is prevented from acting promptly to deal with such stress situation and such crisis, then it can be even more damaging for Singapore's reputation as a financial centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 999<p>On the issue of&nbsp;minimum cash balances, again, this is the need to balance flexibility and transparency.&nbsp; Again, when we made the changes of an&nbsp;imposed requirement, this will be put up as a subsidiary legislation and which will be gazetted when we notify the banks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the asset maintenance requirements, Mr Inderjit Singh asked what were the practices in other countries.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;assure him that asset maintenance is in fact one of the prudential tools which enhance the protection of depositors and this is a practice &nbsp;which is commonly done in other jurisdictions. Basically, if a branch of a foreign bank faces problems, we&nbsp;want to be able to circle some of the assets they have here so that its assets can be protected and to pay the local depositors.&nbsp; Other jurisdictions in fact go further and require the bank to incorporate locally before they can accept&nbsp;retail deposits.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;in fact, the regime that we have here is fairly liberal.&nbsp; We allow the foreign banks to set up branches here, but we do want to introduce this new asset maintenance regime in order to be able to protect our depositors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth area is the priority ranking of&nbsp;depositors and Mr Inderjit Singh asked whether, with such a situation,&nbsp;banks would game and go for a situation where the inter-bank deposits will rank higher.&nbsp; I think this is a possibility.&nbsp; But I am sure when banks undertake activities with their counter parties, they do not just take this as&nbsp;a key consideration.&nbsp; Before entering into any transaction, I am sure the principal consideration of the bank is the creditworthiness of its counter parties, and not the ranking of its inter-bank deposits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth area is the credit card regime.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh welcomes the tightening of the rules.&nbsp; But at the same <p align=left>Column: 1000<p>time, he wonders whether we should have a single entity to regulate all the credit.&nbsp; I think we do want to prevent Singaporeans getting themselves into situations where, as Mr Inderjit Singh mentioned, they borrow money to pay earlier credit problems or loans and, as a result, they end up spiralling into a situation where it is very difficult for them to get out.&nbsp; At the same time, we cannot be overly stringent.&nbsp; If we cut off the limits on credit card applications too stringently and we prevent avenues for lower-income Singaporeans to borrow through, say, for example, the Moneylenders Act, then they have nowhere to go and they will probably end up with the loansharks.&nbsp; So this is where we have to strike a balance.&nbsp; Indeed, this is what we have done between the Ministry of Law which oversees the Moneylenders Act and MAS which oversees the Banking Act.&nbsp; You have noticed in recent months that&nbsp;we have coordinated the policies so that we have a consistent regulatory framework with regard to credit borrowing from Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the four issues raised by Mdm Ho Geok Choo.&nbsp; The first issue is on SME financing and her suggestion of a SME bank.&nbsp; I think we have addressed this just now in&nbsp;a Question for Oral Answer.&nbsp; We have quite a wide range of avenues for SMEs to have access to financing, whether through trade financing,&nbsp;term loans, factoring, or through Government assistance, LEFS scheme and many other schemes, which I mentioned just now.&nbsp; We will continue to evolve and provide more opportunities.&nbsp; Right now, many banks in fact regard SME financing as an area of growth that they will be focusing on.&nbsp; I know of many banks who see that by developing the SME sector in Singapore as a template for which they can bring the business model to the regional countries and&nbsp;it is a way of expanding their business.&nbsp; So it is not true that the banks see the SME as a sector <p align=left>Column: 1001<p>for which there are no good business prospects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS will continue to welcome initiatives by the financial institutions to provide new financing options for the SMEs.&nbsp; For example, we have seen some initiatives put up to allow the SMEs to tap the capital markets and also to assess credit applications based on cashflow analysis, and not just simply on collateral.&nbsp; Let me also stress that MAS continues to be open to admitting financial institutions with specialised expertise in SME financing, so long as they are&nbsp;financially sound and meet our prudential standards.&nbsp; Some players in foreign markets who specialise in SME financing do not take deposits.&nbsp; In such instances, they will not require a banking licence from the MAS.&nbsp; There are a few of such players in Singapore already who are funded primarily in the capital market and which provides equipment leasing, factoring and other working capital loans to our SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho asked about the technology risks and whether our credit card technology can be updated to prevent fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole issue of the appropriate technology to apply in credit cards, MAS' position is to leave it largely to the private sector.&nbsp; They are in the best position to decide for themselves.&nbsp; Let me tell the House that from the annual statistics that MAS has been collecting from the banks in Singapore on credit card fraud, in fact, credit card fraud losses have fallen significantly in the past few years.&nbsp; Between 2002 and 2005, credit card fraud losses have fallen by more than 50%, from $9.7 million to $4.5 million.&nbsp; So MAS does not see this as a very big problem.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, we will continue to monitor it and we will continue to encourage the credit card providers to adopt the right technology to prevent credit card fraud.&nbsp; They have to balance the likely losses from the fraud with the cost to be incurred in introducing new or very difficult technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1002<p> Mdm Ho also asked about the disclosure of product information.&nbsp; It is true that some of the banks are very aggressive in cross selling.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, we have the&nbsp;Financial Advisers Act which regulates such cross selling and the market conduct of such cross selling.&nbsp; Under the Financial Advisers Act, all material information related to the product must be provided to the clients and such information disclosed must be clear,&nbsp;adequate and not false or misleading.&nbsp; So the rules are there and MAS will continue to enforce these rules.&nbsp; There are also similar rules, as I mentioned just now, on structured deposits&nbsp;which sometimes Singaporeans find difficulty in understanding the risks which they are undertaking in taking up these products.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo talked about advertisements on the Net.&nbsp; Basically, our approach to advertising on the Net for credit card is that if the advertising is targeted at Singaporeans, then it will come under the rules.&nbsp; I think that is the guiding principle.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.16 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (Prof. S Jayakumar):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Trade Marks Act to pave the way for Singapore to ratify the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks.&nbsp; That Treaty is the tangible outcome of a very&nbsp;successful diplomatic conference that the World Intellectual Property Organisation held in Singapore in March last year.&nbsp; The Treaty further harmonises trademark registration procedures and provides for electronic filing, making it more convenient for businesses to register and manage their trademarks globally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For applicants filing trademarks in Singapore to gain from the benefits of the Treaty, we need to bring our domestic trademarks regime into full compliance with its provisions, and also for us to ratify the Treaty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Provision for multiple-class system</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our trademarks regime is already largely compliant with the provisions of the Treaty.&nbsp; But for&nbsp;full compliance, we need to amend the Trade Marks Act to enable IPOS to fully implement a \"multiple-class\" trademark registration system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For trademark registration, goods and services are categorised into 45 classes as defined in the Third Schedule of the Trade Mark Rules.&nbsp; Currently, those wishing to register a trademark with IPOS in more than one class have to submit a separate application for each class. &nbsp;With a multiple-class system, they only need to submit one single application for all the applicable classes. &nbsp;This will make it more <p align=left>Column: 1004<p>convenient for trademark owners and&nbsp;their agents, as they will be able to manage their trademark registrations in appropriate bundles instead of handling each registration individually.&nbsp; For example, only one registration will be necessary for all classes of goods and services claimed for the same trademark. These bundles of registrations can be assigned, renewed or licensed as bundles as well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To implement a multiple-class system, clause 3 of the Bill amends section 17 of the Trade Marks Act to allow the registration of a series of similar trademarks in two or more classes of goods or services.&nbsp; To complement a multiple-class system, clause 2 introduces a new section 5A to allow the division of a trademark application into two or more applications. &nbsp;This is because there may be times when an applicant may wish to divide up a multiple-class application into two or more applications. &nbsp;For example, the applicant may wish to register the trademarks for those classes that do not face opposition first, instead of holding the entire multiple-class application back.</p><p><br><I>Relief measures for procedural oversight</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Treaty also provides for relief measures to alleviate procedural mistakes by trademark applicants so that they do not lose the rights to the trademarks filed.&nbsp; This is because there may be instances when they miss certain time limits to respond to objections or queries from the Registrar of Trademarks and their trademark applications then become treated as withdrawn.&nbsp; There may also be instances when applicants may need more time to respond to the Registrar.&nbsp; To comply with the Treaty, clause 5 amends section 108 for rules to be made on extending time limits and for reinstating withdrawn trademark applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For consistency with the other rule-making provisions in the Act, clause 5 also removes the technical requirement <p align=left>Column: 1005<p>for the Minister to consult IPOS on rule changes since these are inevitably done in consultation with IPOS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other amendments:&nbsp; registration of licence of pending trademarks</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than aligning our trademarks regime with the provisions of the Treaty, this Bill also seeks to provide businesses with greater flexibility in trademark management.&nbsp; Specifically, clause 4 amends section 41 to allow the registration of licences relating to pending trademarks and not just registered trademarks. This is to enable third parties to take note of the licensee&rsquo;s interest in the trademark.&nbsp; It is useful even if the trademark is pending registration as some trademarks can quickly acquire goodwill and become highly desirable for licensing through franchising.&nbsp; This proposed amendment will enhance our business-friendliness and put Singapore on par with jurisdictions such as the UK and Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, Sir, this Bill will bring about greater convenience to businesses as well as&nbsp;update our trademarks regime to be on par with international practices. &nbsp;It will also enable us to ratify and participate in the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks so that applicants filing trademarks in Singapore may benefit when the Treaty comes into operation.&nbsp; Consultations by IPOS indicate that the proposed changes have been&nbsp;welcomed by trademark applicants and supported by the trademark agents in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp; -&nbsp; [Prof. S Jayakumar].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><p align=left>Column: 1006<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Chairman:</B> The citation year \"2006\" will be changed to \"2007\", as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>Clauses 1</I> to <I>6</I> inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I propose to take the break now.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 4.45 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\">Sitting accordingly suspended</p><p align=\"right\">at 4.24 pm until 4.45 pm.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t<P><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><em>Sitting resumed at 4.45 pm</em><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div></P>      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1006<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL:::1014--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>STATUTES (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as its title implies, this Bill collates a number of amendments to several Acts which are mainly technical in nature. Let me highlight the key ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to various Acts relating to record keeping requirements</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister and Minister for Finance announced in the Annual Budget <p align=left>Column: 1007<p>Statement last year that a decision had been made to reduce the record-keeping period in a number of statutes, generally to five years with a view to reducing the burden and costs to businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to that statement, this Bill proposes amending 14 statutes to reduce to or specify a record-keeping period of five years. Amendments to the record-keeping period in a few more statutes will be made when those statutes are individually amended at a later time. With the exception of the Charities Act and the Income Tax Act, the amendments to the statutes covered under this Bill will apply to existing records to enable businesses to enjoy the benefits of the amendments as soon as they are brought into effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the Charities Act and Income Tax Act, the reduction in record-keeping period from seven years to five years under the Income Tax Act will take effect from year of assessment 2008 whilst that under the Charities Act will take effect from any financial year ending in 2007. These proposed effective dates for the Income Tax Act and Charities Act will give IRAS sufficient time to prepare for the transition and also give taxpayers and charities sufficient notice of the changes and the related transitional provisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Patents Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 makes several technical amendments to the Patents Act. Generally, these amendments will bring our patent system in line with two changes to the Regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT) to which Singapore is a party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is to provide an applicant with two more months after the statutory 12-month period to file his Singapore <p align=left>Column: 1008<p>patent application and claim priority over an earlier relevant application that he has filed in a Paris Convention or WTO member state, provided the applicant can show that he missed the initial 12-month period unintentionally, or despite showing due care.&nbsp; Amendments to section 17 of the Patents Act, with consequential amendments to section 87, are proposed to effect this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second is to allow an applicant to include the description and missing parts in his Singapore patent application by making reference to an earlier relevant application which completely contains them, assuming his Singapore patent application has claimed priority over this earlier relevant application. This allows the applicant to secure or retain the original date of filing of the application, and is important as a later date of filing could expose the application to additional prior art that would decrease the patentability of the invention. To effect this, amendments to section 26 of the Patents Act are proposed, along with consequential amendments to sections 2, 28, 29, 36A, 80 and 84.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these PCT-related amendments demonstrate our continuing commitment to keep our patent system in line with international developments. Public consultations show that the proposed changes are expected to be welcomed by both applicants and patent agents for the added flexibility they bring to the patent application process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from these PCT-related amendments, other technical amendments are also proposed to clarify provisions in the Patents Act concerning the requirement for English translation of foreign language patent applications, the publication status of PCT applications entering national phase in Singapore, and the entitlement of persons to act as patent agents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1009<p><p><I>Amendment to the Plant Varieties Protection Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 7 aligns section 52 of the Plant Varieties Protection Act with corresponding sections in the Trade Marks, Patents, and Registered Designs Acts regarding composition of offences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ame<I>ndment of Boundaries and Survey Maps Act and amendment of Land Surveyors Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the principal amendments to the Land Surveyors Act, or \"LSA\" for short, are to provide for the licensing of Limited Liability Partnerships (or \"LLPs\") formed by registered surveyors to supply or engage in survey services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presently, the LSA only has provisions to grant licences to corporations and partnerships to supply or engage in survey services.&nbsp; There are no provisions to grant licences to LLPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The LLP is a business structure which is especially suitable for professional firms. The amendments will allow registered surveyors to form such business entities. This is a pro-business approach. Similar amendments have been made to the Professional Engineers Act and Architects Act to allow for LLPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other amendments to the LSA are technical and minor in nature, whilst the amendments to the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act are consequential to the proposed amendments to the LSA to provide for LLPs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to Schedule A of the Criminal Procedure Code</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Schedule A of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) lists out Penal Code offences and provides whether the Police may arrest without a warrant and whether bail is available as of right. The amendments rectify the anomaly where sections 130B, 130C and 151A of the <p align=left>Column: 1010<p>Penal Code have been omitted from the Schedule.&nbsp; Section 130B concerns piracy on the high seas, section 130C concerns piractical acts and section 151A concerns the making, printing or distributing of any document that incites violence or counsels disobedience to a lawful order of a public servant or is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.&nbsp; These are all serious offences. Other offences similar in nature and gravity are likewise also \"seizable\" offences. With these amendments, Police will be able to arrest offenders of sections 130B, 130C and 151A in the Penal Code without a warrant. These three offences will not be compoundable, and the offenders will not be entitled to bail as of right, but at the discretion of the court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Immigration Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Immigration Act currently allows ICA to require the furnishing of security from the master, owner, charterer or agent of any vessel, aircraft or train arriving in Singapore, if ICA has reasonable grounds to believe that any person arriving on board, such as a member of the crew, a passenger, or a stowaway, may attempt to disembark in or enter Singapore illegally.&nbsp; The purpose of this security bond is to cover the cost of the maintenance and repatriation of the person if he is subsequently stranded in Singapore. The bond will only be enforced if any of its conditions is breached in contravention of the Immigration Act and its regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Act requires the security in such cases to be furnished by way of a bond, or a bond accompanied by a guarantee from the bank or insurer. The Act also requires the form of the bond and the guarantee to be stipulated. This restricts the types of security and the form of the bond and guarantee which ICA can accept. In addition, it limits the selection of the acceptable types of security which are available to the shipping community. Hence, clause 10 <p align=left>Column: 1011<p>seeks to amend section 43(4) of the Act to vest powers in the Controller of Immigration to determine the manner and form of security required, so as to allow flexibility on the type or types of security which may be accepted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Public Transport Council Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 13 makes a technical amendment to the definition of \"ticket payment service\" in the Public Transport Council Act to clarify that the service relates to \"mode of payment for tickets\" instead of \"tickets\". This reflects accurately the intention for the PTC to regulate a service provider who provides a service which relates to any \"mode of payment for tickets\". An example of a \"mode of payment for tickets\" is the ez-link card.&nbsp; The amendment does not expand the scope of the definition but merely serves to clarify it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to the Public Utilities Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 14 amends paragraph 1 of the Third Schedule to the Public Utilities Act to change the financial year of the PUB. Currently, based on the calendar year, it will be changed to start from 1st April and end on 31st March the following year.&nbsp; Consumers and suppliers will not be affected by this change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendments to the Road Traffic Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendment to section 44(1) of the Road Traffic Act will remove the current stipulation in section 44(1) that the Deputy Commissioner of Police may keep a driver's conviction or&nbsp; disqualification record for a period not exceeding three years. At present, a certificate relating to the particulars of any conviction or disqualification maintained under section 44(1) is <I>prima facie</I> evidence of the conviction or <p align=left>Column: 1012<p>disqualification, by virtue of section 44(2). The proposed amendment will allow a certificate relating to the particulars of any conviction or disqualification, recorded and maintained under section 44(1), to be <I>prima facie</I> evidence of the conviction or disqualification under section 44(2), when the conviction or disqualification occurred more than three years previously.</p><p><br><I>Amendment to Supreme Court of Judicature Act and Subordinate Courts Act as a consequence of the five-day work week</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clauses 16 and 17 amend the Subordinate Courts Act and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act to reflect the days on which the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts and their respective Registries must be open, following the introduction of the five-day work week in the civil service in 2004. However, notwithstanding the amendments, the Supreme Court and Subordinate Court Registries will continue to function on Saturdays. At the Subordinate Courts - Mentions Court 26, Family Court 1 and the Juvenile Court will also continue to remain open on Saturdays so that arrested persons may be produced before a Magistrate before the expiry of the 48 hour maximum detention period stipulated in section 36 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The amendments will also not change the position that a Supreme Court Judge or a judicial officer of the Subordinate Courts may lawfully sit on a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday if in the opinion of the Judge or judicial officer, the business to be dispatched is extremely urgent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Amendment to section 139 of the Women's Charter</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under section 139 of the Women's Charter, the power to make rules to fix the fees and costs payable for matrimonial proceedings as well as the <p align=left>Column: 1013<p>rules concerning the practice and procedure for matrimonial proceedings is vested in the Chief Justice and two other Judges of the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice is of the view that the judges of the Family Court ought to be formally involved in the making of rules governing matrimonial proceedings and that the rules should be relevant to the lay person.&nbsp; Clause 18 amends section 139 of the Women&rsquo;s Charter to provide that the rules committee will comprise the Chief Justice, a Judge of the Supreme Court and a District Judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two practising lawyers appointed by the Chief Justice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, lastly, the Bill corrects a grammatical error in section 2(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have some queries for the Senior Minister of State concerning the rationale for the reduction of the record-keeping period which is dealt with in clauses&nbsp;2 to 4 and also in the Schedule of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I recall correctly, in October 2005, this issue actually came up before Parliament in the context of the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill. At that time, the House was told that IRAS needed to keep records for seven years and one of the reasons was that the Limitation Act still provided a six-year time bar for actions and IRAS needed that allowance for some actions where they have to recover back taxes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as far as I know, the time bar under the Limitation Act still remains the same at six years for most civil actions.&nbsp; My question is whether this reduction in record-keeping to five years would risk <p align=left>Column: 1014<p>destruction of relevant records which might be needed for court actions.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1015<p><p><I>Introduction</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, although the intent of this Secondhand Goods Dealers Bill to provide for the licensing and control of secondhand goods dealers remains the same as the current Secondhand Dealers Act (SHDA), MHA is proposing to enact a new Bill because most of the sections in the current Act have been amended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Secondhand Dealers Act was enacted in 1918 to regulate businesses that deal in the trading of secondhand goods.&nbsp; That is almost 100 years ago. This is because businesses that deal with secondhand goods trading have the potential to be a channel for criminals to dispose of stolen goods - or what is known as fencing.&nbsp; Hence, the need to regulate the secondhand goods trading industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Act has been useful in solving some crimes.&nbsp; Members will know that, in recent years, handphone theft nearly tripled from 1,700 cases in 2001 to more than 4,800 cases in 2005 before falling to about 4,600 cases last year.&nbsp; Police's regulatory control of secondhand dealers, as well as other enforcement measures, has contributed to this improving trend.&nbsp; Apart from intensifying checks on dealers of secondhand handphones, Police compared the leads from cases of handphone theft against the transaction records of dealers.&nbsp; These efforts have improved our success rate in crime solving and this, in turn, has had a deterrent effect on thieves and errant secondhand handphone dealers.&nbsp; Clearly, the Act has been useful in helping Police deal with errant dealers who are responsible for the quick and easy disposition of stolen handphones.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the intent of the Act remains the same, the crime situation has changed <p align=left>Column: 1016<p>considerably over the years.&nbsp; This Bill before the House reflects a refinement of the existing Act to better serve today&rsquo;s regulatory and investigative requirements.&nbsp; It also seeks to bring it up to date with Police&rsquo;s current enforcement needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Sharper regulatory focus</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the new Act will sharpen the focus of the regulatory regime for secondhand goods dealers.&nbsp; We assess that there is no need to subject all secondhand goods dealers to regulatory requirements, such as yearly registration and payment of fees, especially if the items they deal in are of little crime control value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, whereas the Schedule of the current Act contains a list of goods that are excluded from regulation under the SHDA, that is, a &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; approach, the new Act will take a &ldquo;positive list&rdquo; approach, that is to say, the new definition of secondhand &ldquo;goods&rdquo; in clause 2 of the Bill will cover only items that have considerable value and which have been identified to be common items of theft and easily disposed of to secondhand goods dealers by property offenders.&nbsp; To ensure that we can adjust quickly to changing crime trends, the Minister will have powers to amend this &ldquo;positive list&rdquo; by order in the <I>Gazette</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This &ldquo;positive list&rdquo; approach in regulation will benefit dealers in secondhand goods that are not in the Schedule.&nbsp; Such an approach is also more pro-business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let me assure the House that, with this loosening of control over the industry, Police will still exercise regulatory control over dealers in secondhand goods which are of interest to the Police.&nbsp; Enforcement checks will continue to ensure that errant dealers are dealt with accordingly under the SHDA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Expansion of scope</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1017<p> Sir, the second major enhancement to the current regime involves extending the definition of &ldquo;shop&rdquo; beyond physical shop premises, to include any place of business, whether a physical place or a virtual one like the Internet.&nbsp; The current Act does not cover dealers operating without a shop.&nbsp; We recognise that many secondhand goods dealers today actually carry on their business via other means, such as on the Internet, or in an open-air setting like Sungei Road.&nbsp; This is unacceptable, as thieves and robbers will simply get rid of their loot through these other dealers who do not have a shop-front.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MHA is hence widening the coverage of the law to include those dealers who do not operate within a shop.&nbsp; However, in keeping with the emphasis on a sharper regulatory focus, only dealers who trade in secondhand goods that are listed in the Schedule will come under the ambit of the Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Record-Keeping</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect of this Bill lies in clause 10, which requires selected dealers to keep transaction records and to submit these to the Police.&nbsp; Such records are valuable in facilitating Police&rsquo;s work in crime control and investigation.&nbsp; Secondhand goods dealers are also required by law to retain the records for a period of not less than five years and to produce such records for examination by any Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, Licensing Officer or police officer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Consolidate and update penalties</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Act has not been amended for some time, the penalties in the SHDA are generally light in today&rsquo;s context.&nbsp; Apart from the penalty of an imprisonment term of up to three years for dealers in used bicycles or bicycle parts, motor vehicles <p align=left>Column: 1018<p>or motor vehicle parts, for failing to keep proper books of accounts, all other offences carry only a penalty of a fine of up to $1,000, and an imprisonment term of up to six months.&nbsp; These penalties are insufficient in today&rsquo;s context as revenues of dealers&rsquo; trade are considerably higher.&nbsp; The law will then lose its impact, if it poses little deterrence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the Pawnbrokers Act as a benchmark as the two Acts are similar in intent and purpose, MHA is consolidating all the penalties in clause 18 of the Bill, which imposes a stiffer general penalty of a fine not exceeding $20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, to any person convicted of an offence under the proposed Act or its Rules.&nbsp; As this is only the maximum amount of the fine, the court will have greater leeway to impose the appropriate punishment in any particular case.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Composition of offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clauses 18 and 19 give Police more powers in bringing errant dealers to task.&nbsp; But, as not every case is serious enough to be prosecuted in court, the new Act will empower the Licensing Officer to compound any such offence prescribed as compoundable by the Minister, with a composition fine not exceeding $2,000.&nbsp; This is in line with the process Ministry of Law started two years ago to make some offences, where appropriate, compoundable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker Sir, enacting this Bill will mean that, for a start, more than 900 existing dealers would no longer be licensed under the Act, as they are not currently dealing in goods in the Schedule or the &ldquo;positive list&rdquo;.&nbsp; This is in line with the policy to reduce regulatory controls on businesses.&nbsp; Police will focus their control over secondhand goods dealers who trade in high-end or profitable secondhand goods, using the new &ldquo;positive list&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1019<p>Sir, in conclusion, the Government, through this new Act, is taking another important step to help ensure that our legislation keeps pace with evolving trends so that we can keep crime under control whilst allowing businesses as much room to operate as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.10 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.&nbsp; The proposed Bill will provide a comprehensive legislative framework to regulate the trading of secondhand goods in Singapore, and prevent the sale of stolen goods through secondhand dealers.&nbsp; Sir, the rise in prices of consumer goods and the promotion of reuse or recycling of consumer goods for environmental protection reasons have created a market for secondhand goods in Singapore.&nbsp; This is especially so for secondhand goods such as precious metals, jewellery, computers, electronic devices, and antiques.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This growth in the secondhand goods market has at the same time also provided a convenient channel for stolen goods to be traded in secondhand goods shops or through the Internet.&nbsp; Thus, it is indeed timely to update the current Secondhand Dealers Act which was enacted in 1918 and to take into consideration the new range of secondhand goods, the avenues where secondhand goods are transacted, and the prevention of stolen goods being transacted in the secondhand goods market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposed Bill has placed stringent measures to regulate secondhand goods dealers in terms of licensing, keeping proper records, facilitating Police <p align=left>Column: 1020<p>investigation, and penalty regime. But there are certain shortcomings in the&nbsp;Bill with regard to the impact of the Bill on cost of business, control of secondhand goods shops, keeping of proper records, retention of secondhand goods , unfair practices, and protection of consumers purchasing secondhand goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(1)&nbsp; Cost of business and secondhand goods dealers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposed Bill will increase the business cost of secondhand goods dealers as there will be licensing fee, licence renewal fee, transfer fee, and cost of keeping proper records for five years.&nbsp; In addition, dealers are bound by the Act to provide information at their expense to facilitate Police investigation.&nbsp; Sir, I wish to ask the following clarifications from the Minister: (i) how much is the licensing fee as compared to the present fee; (ii) is the licence fee applicable for one shop outlet or multiple shop outlets for the same firm; (iii) what is the period of the licence; (iv) how much are the renewal and transfer fees; and (v) whether there are procedures and prescribed forms to ensure the standardisation of keeping proper records in English such as a master register of secondhand goods&nbsp;in possession, and those transacted stating the time at which and the person from whom he purchased or received such goods, including their particulars?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I propose that the Bill provide a standard procedure and the use of prescribed forms so as to ensure compliance, reduce business cost and facilitate Police investigation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(2)&nbsp; Control of secondhand goods shops</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, licensing will ensure proper control of the secondhand goods dealers and the secondhand goods market.&nbsp; To further facilitate the enforcement of licensed dealers, I propose that we should include a clause highlighting the need for <p align=left>Column: 1021<p>secondhand goods dealers to display their licences in a conspicuous place in their shops or sale outlets.&nbsp; These signages should also be of a certain size and type as prescribed by the licensing authority displaying such words as \"Licensed dealer in secondhand goods\".&nbsp; The display of licence and signage will also protect consumers who wish to purchase secondhand goods from authorised secondhand dealers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The growth in Internet transactions, both locally and overseas, has made it challenging to control the sale of secondhand goods&nbsp;on the Net.&nbsp; I would like to clarify with the Minister as to how this proposed Act will regulate Internet sale of secondhand goods, especially for auction websites, where not much information of both sellers and buyers are needed for the transactions.&nbsp; Such Internet transactions may provide the loopholes where stolen goods can be channelled for disposal.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to seek clarifications from the Minister as to whether licences are required for individual stall operators of flea market, trade fairs and ad hoc car boot sale operators, including community-based organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(3) Keeping of proper records</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the keeping of proper records is a costly process but a necessity for control purposes.&nbsp; In Singapore, many secondhand goods dealers are small and medium enterprises.&nbsp; Many do not have the resources to modernise their operations, such as using information technology to keep track of transactions and inventory control.&nbsp; Thus, the requirements of the Bill to keep five years proper records will have significant impact on these businesses making it difficult for them to comply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would propose that the Ministry spell out clearly the format and information required in keeping proper <p align=left>Column: 1022<p>records for the purpose of crime prevention and investigation so that secondhand goods dealers can comply without undue financial commitments.&nbsp; In addition, the Ministry should also take this opportunity to encourage secondhand dealers to upgrade and computerise their operations and provide appropriate Government grant through SPRING Singapore to support these SMEs.&nbsp; The upgrading of business practices of secondhand goods dealers will also benefit the Police Force in its crime prevention efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(4) Retention of secondhand goods</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To deter the transaction of stolen goods and ensure recovery of such goods, it is necessary for the Act to specify the retention of certain specified secondhand goods, especially those which can be disposed of easily, for a certain period such as one month.&nbsp; There should be provisions in the Act to require licensed dealers who acquire secondhand goods other than from another licensed dealer to retain such goods in possession for a minimum period before reselling them or making modifications to the goods.&nbsp; This will provide more time for Police to effectively investigate and recover stolen goods.&nbsp; In this aspect, may I ask the Minister how effective is the Police in helping people to recover stolen property?&nbsp; If the recovery rate is low, we should put in place more measures in the Act to facilitate the recovery of stolen goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(5) Unfair practices</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 11 of the Bill requires the secondhand goods dealers to provide information of stolen goods or lost secondhand goods to the Police upon notification.&nbsp; Failure to do so is an offence under the Act.&nbsp; This requirement is indeed very onerous on the dealers, especially when they have to deal with thousands of secondhand goods transactions and <p align=left>Column: 1023<p>stocks, especially for small items such as handphones or electronic devices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In practice, it may be difficult for the dealers to provide the required information on time to facilitate Police investigation or it will cost the business a lot to comply with every Police's request under clause 11.&nbsp; This practice, if frequently implemented, will be unfair to the dealers as their business operations will be adversely affected.&nbsp; I would propose that this clause be implemented with caution, and should only apply in situations where there&nbsp;is sufficient evidence that dubious dealers are deliberately concealing information on secondhand goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, instead of penalising dealers for not collaborating, I would urge the Ministry to consider incentivising dealers who furnish information resulting in the solving of crimes.&nbsp; These good efforts by the dealers can be appropriately rewarded or recognised when renewing their licences.&nbsp; In this way, we can further encourage partnership between the Police and secondhand dealers in crime prevention and increase the chances of recovery for stolen goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(6) Protection of consumers purchasing secondhand goods</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposed Bill does not offer any protection to consumers buying secondhand goods.&nbsp; While we practise the <I>caveat emptor</I> principle,&nbsp;the secondhand goods market is a complex market where consumers can be easily conned into purchasing stolen goods or misrepresented into paying new goods prices for secondhand goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further protect consumers, I would propose that the licensing authority should maintain a directory of licensed secondhand goods dealers on its website so that consumers can authenticate these <p align=left>Column: 1024<p>dealers when purchasing secondhand goods.&nbsp; The authority should also display dealers whose licences have been revoked or suspended.&nbsp; This will prevent such dealers from operating in our market and conning our consumers.&nbsp; I wish to ask the Minister what measures are in place in the Bill to protect consumers of buying secondhand goods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I just wish to ask the Senior Minister of State whether it is intended for secondhand goods dealers like <I>karung guni</I> men who deal occasionally with the goods listed in the Schedule of the&nbsp;Bill to be registered under this Bill.&nbsp; If so, bearing in mind their low educational qualifications, whether any form of assistance would be given to them to enable them to comply with the licensing requirements under the Act.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Sir, I thank both Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Lim for their comments and, in particular, Dr Teo who has made some points which&nbsp;will enable me to explain how this Act will work out.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, of course, this is not a new Act.&nbsp; This is an Act which has been in place for some time, but too long and therefore we are replacing it.&nbsp; When we look at how to improve the workings of the Act,&nbsp;we look at what is happening on the ground, at any loopholes that need to be filled up and, yet, at the same time to maintain, like I have said, a business environment that is friendly.&nbsp; In other words, one key focus of this Act is really to enforce with a lighter touch.&nbsp; So let me reiterate what we have done which is essentially working with a positive list.&nbsp; This makes it very clear that only those goods which are of interest to Police, and if you look at the Schedule, there are nine of them, will be regulated.&nbsp; In fact, the old Act had items, such as gunny bags, sail cloths, <p align=left>Column: 1025<p>canvas, kerosene tins, oil drums and other similar empty receptacles, wooden and tin lined boxes and cases, and so forth. These are probably some of the materials that the <I>karung guni</I> men will deal in.&nbsp; So to modernise it, we look at what goods ought to be covered.&nbsp; This is number one.&nbsp; Already, with this approach, out of the 2,700 currently registered licences being issued,&nbsp;900 licences would not need to be taken out.&nbsp; So we are reducing that straightaway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to that, the current Act in fact also provides an exemption scheme.&nbsp; In other words, currently, the approach taken by Police is that if some other Act already covers you, for example, the Pawnbrokers Act, because the intent of the Pawnbrokers Act is also to include people who may leave goods there and these may be stolen goods too,&nbsp;you will not be covered under the Moneylenders Act. But Police tells me that in working out this new regime, what they intend to do is to look at the track record of the licensee.&nbsp; If he has a good track record, they are prepared to exempt him from the licensing requirement.&nbsp; In other words, he need not pay the licence fee, but he would be required to notify Police of the fact that he is in business and he would agree to submit information as and when required.&nbsp; We have tried the exemption approach for various other regimes like the massage parlour scheme where we want to be able to also reward good conduct.&nbsp; So those who already have a good track record need not be burdened with the regulatory scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the question of business cost should be seen in this context.&nbsp; We are not there to increase business cost.&nbsp; In fact, we are very mindful of business cost.&nbsp; And that is why the fee regime will be retained.&nbsp; Currently, it is $150 for the whole year.&nbsp; It will be so.&nbsp; And in fact, if you look at the current Act, already the processes of transfer, renewal, and so <p align=left>Column: 1026<p>forth, are there.&nbsp; So the current regime will stay.&nbsp; Indeed, there is an improvement because under the current scheme, the licence is taken to start from 1st&nbsp;January to&nbsp;end on 31st December.&nbsp; So if a new person comes on board in June, he has to renew on&nbsp;1st January the following year.&nbsp; But now, with more flexibility, it will be one calendar year from the time the person is issued with a licence.&nbsp; That is why I am not minded, for example, to take up&nbsp;the suggestion of Dr Teo's that may in fact add to business cost.&nbsp; For example, if you say, \"Why not&nbsp;require the dealer to keep the goods for one year?\", that would mean that he would have holding cost; he would have compliance cost; he would have monitoring cost.&nbsp; That is why I do not think we need to do that.&nbsp; But I will show that by one or two things that we have done, the plight of consumers who may have lost goods and indeed the plight of consumers who may buy secondhand goods which are stolen will be somewhat ameliorated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I say this?&nbsp; This is linked to the second point which is the format of the reporting structure.&nbsp; Dr Teo very rightly pointed out that requiring dealers to keep information is important.&nbsp; But of course the framework that Police imposes must be reasonable.&nbsp; Five years is reasonable because, like I have just mentioned in my earlier speech in this House,&nbsp;amendments have been moved to standardise record-keeping periods in various Acts&nbsp;to five years.&nbsp; I think it is fair to ask the secondhand goods dealers to keep records for five years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The format, again, will be a simple one.&nbsp; I take his point that if you want people to keep information and if you want the dealers to submit information as and when required, it should not be a very complicated and complex field.&nbsp; So Police has got that clearly in mind.&nbsp; In fact, he made a very good point too regarding whether or not we should encourage the secondhand goods dealers to submit <p align=left>Column: 1027<p>through online.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we are mindful that not all secondhand goods dealers are sophisticated.&nbsp; But Dr Teo urges that Police should take this opportunity to maybe work with SPRING Singapore to get more of them to be computer literate and to maximise and leverage on the benefits of computerisation.&nbsp; I think that Police can do.&nbsp; But the point of keeping it simple, I think, is important.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp;Police intends not just&nbsp;to have one language, but the explanation will be in four languages with&nbsp;the&nbsp;submission in English.&nbsp; But the dealers would know what to submit, as the explanation to them is given in four languages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An additional important piece of information which Police would require that is different from the current position will be the identity of the buyer.&nbsp; Currently, it is not required.&nbsp; Currently, the focus is more on the seller -&nbsp;who&nbsp;the seller is, and so forth.&nbsp; But this is&nbsp;part of more effective tracing.&nbsp; So it is not so much whether the goods are physically there.&nbsp; But if they are not, who bought them.&nbsp; Hence, there will&nbsp;a new requirement where the identity of the buyer will also be required.&nbsp; Hopefully, this would assuage some of&nbsp;the concerns of Dr Teo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, he is right in that one other area that we have to now fill up is this new&nbsp;area that has blossomed and bloomed, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;trading on the Internet.&nbsp; Currently, the Act, being framed in 1918, only covers physical shop fronts.&nbsp; So Police will take the opportunity to also fill up this gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every dealer who deals&nbsp;in secondhand goods, as set out in the Schedule, will have to apply for a licence.&nbsp; If they are not sure, then I would&nbsp;urge them to check with the licensing unit.&nbsp; There is a police licensing unit general enquiry line, 68350000.&nbsp; Basically, Police will be very friendly.&nbsp; They are not there to&nbsp;catch you&nbsp;off guard.&nbsp; They want to <p align=left>Column: 1028<p>help you because some people&nbsp;may not be certain or sure whether they need a licence.&nbsp;And indeed, Dr Teo mentioned some of these.&nbsp; What if you&nbsp;just want to buy and sell your own things online, for example, you are occasionally a person who likes to refresh your wardrobe,&nbsp;will you be caught?&nbsp; Or a flea market, I know that some of&nbsp;our friends set up shop at Tanglin Mall&nbsp;fortnightly.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do not know whether it is first and third week or second and fourth week&nbsp;where you can set up shop and&nbsp;sell things.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;some of the trade bazaars that now dot the island.&nbsp; As a general guide, a person who sells a fairly large amount of goods, especially those of the same type, like handphones, and with some regularity, not once off, that means frequency of trade and especially if you are not selling your own goods or not buying goods for your own consumption, then you will probably be required to obtain a licence.&nbsp; But if you are not sure, just check.&nbsp; So the once-off guy who sells his own goods, I think he&nbsp;need not&nbsp;fear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I have covered business cost.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.32 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, increasingly, terrorists are using explosive precursors like ammonium nitrate as&nbsp;substitutes for explosives.&nbsp; Palestinian terrorists started using these in the 1990s when controls on access to conventional explosives were tightened.&nbsp; The local Jemaah Islamiyah network that ISD disrupted in 2001 and 2002 had planned to procure 17 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for the manufacture of truck bombs to carry out attacks in Singapore.&nbsp; Overseas, the Jemaah Islamiyah successfully used explosive precursors, nitrate-based chemicals and potassium chlorate mixtures respectively, to carry out the Bali and Jakarta Marriot bombings in Indonesia.&nbsp; The seizure of <p align=left>Column: 1030<p>large quantities of ammonium nitrate in London in March 2004 and the theft of 1,200 kilograms of the same material from storage facilities in France in May 2004 highlight the need for control over explosive precursors.&nbsp; The foiled UK airline plot, with the intended use of such precursors, uncovered in August 2006 further reinforces the need to control explosive precursors in Singapore.</p><p><br><I>Background to the control of explosive precursors</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Arms and Explosives Act currently regulates the dealing in, importation, transportation, storage, purchase and disposal of explosives.&nbsp; It does not include explosive precursors, such as ammonium nitrate and potassium perchlorate.&nbsp; Explosive precursors are oxidizing agents with legitimate industrial use that, unfortunately, can also be easily converted into improvised explosive materials.&nbsp; After a study in 2002 for dual use goods, a list of explosive precursors was identified for control.&nbsp; The explosive precursors that have been identified are widely used for research, industrial and agricultural purposes.&nbsp; However, despite their legitimate uses in different industries, they pose a security risk should they fall into the wrong hands.&nbsp; Explosive precursors were assessed based on their chemical properties and their widespread usage in Singapore and also on their potential for use by terrorists in improvised explosive devices.&nbsp; However, in determining effective enforcement controls over these substances, security has to be balanced against stifling the commercial and research activities related to their usage.</p><p><br>&nbsp;<I>Establishing a new licensing structure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these amendments to the Arms and Explosives Act, the Singapore Police Force will take over the control of explosive precursors from the National Environment Agency.&nbsp; The amendments <p align=left>Column: 1031<p>will establish a new licensing structure for explosive precursors to prohibit the possession, storage, importation, exportation, manufacture of or dealing in any explosive precursor unless the person is authorised by the Police.&nbsp; To ensure that the appropriate security measures are in-place to safeguard the precursors, Police will conduct threat and risk assessments on the applicants and storage sites prior to the approval of the licences.&nbsp; New sections 21A to 21H will provide for the licensing of explosive precursors, with sections 21A to 21E providing for the regulation of explosive precursors while sections 21F to 21H set out the provisions that apply generally to licences issued under the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;types of licences required will depend on the activity that a licensee will be involved in.&nbsp; A single licence will cover all the explosive precursors for each type of activity, eg, storage, and it will state the description of the explosive precursors as well as their quantity cap.&nbsp; However, if a licensee is involved in more than one type of activity, eg, storage and deal in, the licensee will require different licences, one to store the explosive precursors and another to deal in the explosive precursors.&nbsp; This is because of the current limitations in the Police Licensing Computerised System.&nbsp; Police will be reviewing this and make it easier for applicants to apply for only one licence for all types of explosive precursors and activities.&nbsp; The detailed regulatory provisions will be set out in the Arms and Explosives (Explosive Precursors) Rules.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As new chemicals will be introduced in the market, and new synthesis methods will be developed with the advancement of technology, we will constantly review the list of explosive precursors and make appropriate changes when necessary.&nbsp; A new Schedule will be introduced to specify the explosive precursors that are <p align=left>Column: 1032<p>to be regulated by the Act.&nbsp; There are currently 15 chemicals of concern locally, including ammonium nitrate, which are common explosive precursors used by terrorists.&nbsp; The Minister will have the power, by order published in the <I>Gazette</I>, to amend the Schedule, with the amendment of section 45, to add or delete chemicals according to the threat situation.&nbsp; Those chemicals currently controlled under Environmental Pollution Control Act will be taken off the Schedule once these amendments are brought into force.&nbsp; The Minister will have the power, by order published in the <I>Gazette</I>, to grant exemptions under the new section 44B, and make rules to regulate explosive precursors by the amendment of section 46.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, not everyone who uses fertilisers and the related chemicals of interest will have to be licensed.&nbsp; To illustrate, only ammonium nitrate fertilisers with nitrogen concentrations of more than 28% will be controlled.&nbsp; This 28% threshold is consistent with the approach in other developed countries with similar legislation, such as the United Kingdom, which has identified ammonium nitrate with less than 28% of nitrogen content as not normally presenting an explosion hazard.&nbsp; The European Fertilisers Manufacturers Association grades ammonium nitrate with less than 28% nitrogen as Type C fertilisers and these are considered non-hazardous and non-dangerous.&nbsp; Moreover, there are also alternatives, such as calcium sulphate, that users can easily switch to so that the impact on the public will be negligible.&nbsp; For more information about the chemicals to be controlled, members of the public may contact the Police Arms and Explosives Branch or visit its website.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Penalty for corporations or persons</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while it is not our intention to stifle the legitimate industrial application of explosive precursors, for example, in <p align=left>Column: 1033<p>agriculture as fertilisers, the penalties for mishandling these must be commensurate with the possible threat it poses to society if it falls into the hands of terrorists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to their dual use nature, explosive precursors could be licensed to corporations and companies or directly to individuals.&nbsp; Having separate penalties for corporations and individuals is to hold them accountable for securing and preventing the misuse of explosive precursors.&nbsp; Corporations may be fined up to $100,000 if they contravene any sub-provision.&nbsp; For individuals, the fine is $50,000 or/and a jail sentence not exceeding two years.&nbsp; The penalties are consistent with that of the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act and the Environmental Pollution Control Act.&nbsp; This, however, is still lower than the penalties for offences relating to breaches of licences for explosives, which attract a maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment.&nbsp; For offences with criminal intent, other&nbsp;legislation will be used.</p><p><br><I>Definition of arms, electronic dart guns and stun guns</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is&nbsp;also updating other provisions&nbsp;in the Act to take into account changes in our security landscape.&nbsp;&nbsp;New definitions of &ldquo;arms&rdquo;, &ldquo;electronic dart guns&rdquo; and &ldquo;stun guns&rdquo; will be amended or introduced to provide for a wider range of new &ldquo;arms&rdquo;, &ldquo;electronic guns&rdquo;, &ldquo;stun guns&rdquo; and new weapon accessories in the market.&nbsp; The Minister will have the power, by order published in the <I>Gazette</I>, to specify any weapon, accessory, article or thing to be &ldquo;arms&rdquo; for the purpose of this Act.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>District Courts to have jurisdiction to hear offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, offences under the Act can be heard in a District Court or a Magistrate&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; However, a Magistrate&rsquo;s <p align=left>Column: 1034<p>Court can only award fines not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months.&nbsp; This restriction curtails the punitive effect of the Act.&nbsp; With the amendments, the offences under the Act will&nbsp;be heard only in a District Court, and the Court will be given jurisdiction to hear and determine all prosecutions for offences under the Act, and to impose the full penalty or punishment prescribed under the Act, notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Impact on industry</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MHA has consulted the industry players extensively and has taken into consideration their feedback.&nbsp; One example is the three-month grace period that will be given to all non-licence holders who possess, import, export, manufacture or deal in any of the explosive precursors to apply for a licence after the amendments come into force.&nbsp; During this period, they will be deemed to hold a licence until their application for licence is approved or the application is refused or withdrawn.&nbsp; For persons who do not wish to apply for a licence under this Act, they will have a six-month grace period</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The proposed amendments to the Arms and Explosives Act will expand regulatory control of explosive precursors such as ammonium nitrate and potassium. As part of our efforts in strengthening our security infrastructure against terrorism, it is necessary that a legislative framework be put in place to regulate the use of chemicals which can be used to make explosives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these explosive precursors have dual uses, meaning they can have both peaceful and hostile applications.&nbsp; To provide additional safeguard to our people, we must set&nbsp;up measures to control the use of explosive precursors in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, however, there are two concerns in the Bill which I would like to highlight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, licensing structure.&nbsp; Clause 6 of the Bill spells out the licensing structure for persons dealing with explosive precursors in situations such as possession, importation, exportation, storage, transportation and manufacture.&nbsp; In order to prevent the hostile use of explosive precursors, we need to control the entire supply chain of such chemicals ranging from its source to its end-user point. Therefore, we must have a single point control and have only one type of licence for all persons dealing with explosive precursors irrespective of their activities in the supply chain.&nbsp; This will ensure better accountability and facilitate monitoring and enforcement by the authorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further minimise the security risks, we should classify the various types of explosive precursors according to their likelihood of converting into explosives, and the quantity used by commercial or <p align=left>Column: 1036<p>Government agencies.&nbsp; A classification of licence by the types of explosive precursors and quantity handled would provide a more efficient and effective \"risk-based\" approach to regulate explosive precursors.&nbsp;Sir, as the control of explosive precursors forms a critical pillar in our security infrastructure, I would urge the Ministry to allocate resources to set up the licensing structure as soon as possible, including upgrading the IT system in the Police Force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope that the Minister can also further clarify on how the licensing structure can help to better control the use of explosive precursors in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is on the monitoring regime.&nbsp; Sir, at present, explosive precursors is used in many applications.&nbsp; This, coupled with the introduction of new compounds with potential of converting into explosives, will pose challenges to the authority to enforce the Act and prevent hostile uses of explosive precursors.&nbsp; Sir, it is difficult to monitor the movement, storage and use of these explosive precursors at different locations at different times.&nbsp; This will increase the risk of having these compounds being&nbsp;put into hostile uses.&nbsp; Sir, I would urge the Ministry&nbsp;to set up a traceability regime where explosive precursors&nbsp;can be tracked closely without imposing too much cost on businesses.&nbsp; We can adopt the procedures as set&nbsp;up in the&nbsp;control of poisons as&nbsp;laid out in the Poisons Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firms dealing with explosive precursors should&nbsp;also&nbsp;set up control systems to monitor such compounds in their respective activities.&nbsp; A reporting structure, similar to the Secondhand Goods Dealers Act, should be put in place where persons dealing with explosive precursors must immediately report to the authority of any loss&nbsp;or missing explosive precursors so that appropriate action can be taken to prevent any hostile attacks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1037<p>Sir, may I ask the&nbsp;Minister how is the Ministry planning to monitor the use of explosive precursors in commercial applications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I thank Dr Teo for raising his concerns.&nbsp; In fact, I have given some information that is required by Dr Teo in my Second Reading speech.&nbsp; Indeed, Sir, the Police will adopt a risk-based approach to regulate the explosive precursors.&nbsp; The explosive precursors that have been included in the regulation were assessed based on their chemical properties and the widespread use in Singapore and also on potential use by the terrorists to make improvised explosive devices.&nbsp; We know that for some kind of explosive precursors, for example, ammonium nitrate, certain concentration levels are required in order for that to be useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given examples of ammonium nitrate when we say that those with 28% or more concentration will be controlled. This is the same standard that other countries use.&nbsp; When we determine the kind of materials to be controlled, we will bear in mind the cost to the business in compliance.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In terms of the control of explosive precursors, Police will be the licensing authority and they will be the single point of control to regulate the people who want to import, manufacture, export or to deal in such explosive precursor materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, of course, we have a system that only allows one type of activity to be reported and controlled.&nbsp; We will look at it.&nbsp; As I have said earlier, I have asked the Police to see how we can further improve the licensing process so that they only need to approve one licence for the purpose of either storage, transport, sale, etc, of all these explosive precursors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be regulations to control and monitor the movement and use of these explosive precursors. Dr Teo referred to it <p align=left>Column: 1038<p>as the \"traceability regime\".&nbsp; In fact, that will be so. The dealers and the storage licensees will be required to maintain proper records for inspection by the Police.&nbsp; And in the event when they lose an item or when an item is stolen,&nbsp;they will have to report immediately to the licensing officer about the circumstances leading to the loss and to explain what further measures will be taken to tighten the security to safeguard the explosive precursors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There will also be specific requirements set down in the transportation of such explosive precursors so that they do not just go all over the place, like we require&nbsp;hazardous material vehicles or vehicles that convey hazardous materials.&nbsp; We can also impose further conditions, such as requiring them to have armed escorts, as we now do for the conveyance of arms, explosives and guns, for example. We can require them to get&nbsp;armed security guards to escort them. The Police will also implement an audit regime.&nbsp; That means, they will go round auditing, checking and ensuring that the licensees&nbsp;comply with all the conditions&nbsp; imposed on the licensees when they carry out their trade.&nbsp; This will be done on a surprise basis.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very mindful that explosive precursors can be misused by those who have no reason to use it other than to cause harm to Singapore.

The second group covers other amendments to the Income Tax Act arising from ongoing reviews to improve our income tax framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill was released for public consultation from June to July 2006. The draft Bill has been revised to incorporate a number of suggestions from businesses and members of the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Tax changes from 2006 Budget Statement</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first highlight the key tax policy changes that were announced in the 2006 Budget Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(a)</I> &nbsp;<I>Maritime Finance Incentive (MFI) scheme</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Maritime Finance Incentive or MFI scheme was introduced to nurture the <p align=left>Column: 1042<p>growth of ship financing activity so as to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s position as a maritime hub. Under this scheme, tax exemption will be granted on the qualifying incomes of Approved Ship Investment Enterprises, with a concessionary tax rate of 10% for Approved Ship Investment Managers. The MFI scheme is introduced by clauses 2, 10, 35, and 44(f) of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(b) &nbsp;Tax treatment of prescribed Islamic financing arrangements</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To promote Islamic finance in Singapore, the tax treatment of prescribed Syariah-compliant financing arrangements entered into by a financial institution on or after 17th February 2006 will be harmonised with conventional financing arrangements to ensure a level playing field. Clause 21 of the Bill provides for these changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(c)&nbsp;Writing down allowances for the cost of acquisition of intellectual property rights</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To boost Singapore&rsquo;s attractiveness as an intellectual property hub, writing down allowances will be extended to companies which have acquired or will be acquiring the exclusive or substantial economic rights to approved intellectual properties in the window period running from 17th February 2006 to 31st October 2008, subject to conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Income Tax Act will also be amended to allow companies to claim writing down allowances for the full cost of acquiring an intellectual property on or before 31st October 2008 even if the payments for the acquisition were made on a staggered or instalment basis. The enhancements to the rules for claiming writing down allowances are covered under clause 16 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1043<p><p><I>(d)&nbsp;Tax deduction for treasury shares for employee stock option and share award obligations</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With effect from the year of assessment 2007, companies will be able to deduct against their income, the cost incurred in the purchase of treasury shares which are used to fulfil obligations on employee stock options and share awards. Clauses 11 and 12 of the Bill provide for these enhancements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(e) &nbsp;Enhancement of the tax exemption scheme for foreign-owned funds</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the tax exemption scheme for foreign-owned funds is limited to funds which are not tax resident in Singapore. To further support the growth in our asset and wealth management industries, tax exemption will be extended to foreign-owned funds which are resident in Singapore and approved during the period from 17th February 2006 to 16th February 2011. This enhancement is reflected under clause 10 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Off-Budget Tax Changes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall now deal with the other tax policy changes which require amendments to the Income Tax Act.&nbsp; Our existing tax policies and incentive schemes are reviewed regularly to ensure that they remain relevant. Let me now highlight three major changes to our incentives and policies that arose from these ongoing reviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(f)&nbsp;Penalty for failure to file an income tax return</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the penalty for not filing an income tax return is significantly less severe than the penalty for under-declaring income.&nbsp; This creates an incentive for taxpayers to avoid taxation by not submitting their income tax <p align=left>Column: 1044<p>returns.&nbsp; To discourage this practice, a penalty of double the amount of tax undercharged will be introduced for the failure to file a tax return in respect of any year of assessment within three years from the filing deadline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify to Members that the new penalty will only be imposed on taxpayers who without any reasonable excuse fail to file their returns in a timely fashion, and is not targeted at taxpayers with valid reasons for late filings. The penalty is introduced by clauses 39, 40, 41, and 42 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>(g)&nbsp;Enhancement of Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR) for parents of legitimised and adopted children</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Parenthood Tax Rebate was introduced as part of the Marriage and Parenthood Package announced in August 2004 to married parents for their second, third, or fourth child born to them or legally adopted on or after 1st January 2004.&nbsp; My Ministry has reviewed the rebate and will be making the following enhancements:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to further promote the importance of an intact family, the rebate will be extended to the natural parents of an illegitimate child born on or after 1st January 2004 if they marry before the child reaches&nbsp;six years of age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, for parents of an adopted child, the child&rsquo;s qualifying age for the parents to receive the rebate will be streamlined from the current age of 21 years to 6 years with effect from 1st January 2006. This means that parents who adopt a child on or after 1st January 2006 will qualify for PTR if the child is below&nbsp;six years old at the point of adoption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes to the Parenthood Tax Rebate Scheme are reflected under clause 29 of the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1045<p><p><I>(h)&nbsp;Adoption of the Financial Reporting Standard 39 for accounting purposes</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be introducing a new section to institute the tax treatment arising from companies&rsquo; adoption of the Financial Reporting Standard 39 which relates to Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, or FRS 39 for short. With FRS 39, companies will now have to reflect most of their financial assets and liabilities at market values in their financial statements. To minimise the tax adjustments arising from the adoption of this standard, the income tax treatment of financial assets and liabilities has been changed so as to be more in line with the accounting treatment. This new section is provided by clause 21 of the Bill. Members may wish to note that IRAS has already issued a circular on 30th December 2005 to explain the changes in detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, 19 other off-Budget changes have been incorporated in this Bill as well. As many of them are technical in nature, or relate to improvements in tax administration, I will not put Members through the details of the remaining changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;- [Mrs Lim Hwee Hua].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill considered in Committee.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Chairman--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p align=\"center\"><strong>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; The citation year &ldquo;2006&rdquo; will be changed to &ldquo;2007&rdquo;, as indicated in the Order Paper Supplement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1046<p><I>Clauses 1</I> to <I>44</I> inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:PROPERTY TAX (SURCHARGE) (ABOLITION) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 1046<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:PROPERTY TAX (SURCHARGE) (ABOLITION) BILL:::1047--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>PROPERTY TAX (SURCHARGE) (ABOLITION) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Finance (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Overview of the Bill</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill seeks to repeal the Property Tax (Surcharge) Act with effect from 1st July 2006.&nbsp; This change was announced by the Prime Minister in his 2006 Budget Statement. The Property Tax (Surcharge) Act was enacted in 1974 to impose a surcharge, in addition to the property tax payable, for certain classes of properties held by foreign owners before 1st January 1974.&nbsp; The purpose then was to discourage foreigners from holding onto these properties during the time of housing shortage.&nbsp; The surcharge is no longer needed as, firstly, we now regulate property ownership by foreigners through the Residential Property Act (RPA), and, secondly, most of these landed properties bought before 1974 have either been sold to Singaporeans or to other foreign owners who have obtained approval under the RPA and who therefore are not required to pay the surcharge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key provisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 1 introduces the Act and states that it will be in effect from 1st July 2006.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 2 repeals the Property Tax (Surcharge) Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1047<p>Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, this Bill provides greater flexibility for the Government-Paid Maternity Leave and Adoption Leave schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Government-Paid Maternity Leave</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me begin with Government-Paid Maternity Leave.&nbsp; In 2004, we extended maternity leave from&nbsp;eight weeks to 12 weeks.&nbsp; For the first and second confinement, employers continue to pay for the first&nbsp;eight weeks, while the <p align=left>Column: 1048<p>Government reimburses the last&nbsp;four weeks.&nbsp; For the third and fourth confinement, the Government pays for the full 12 weeks.&nbsp; However, based on current legislation, the mother must be married to the child's father before the child's birth, and the child must be a Singapore citizen at birth.&nbsp; Otherwise, the mother does not qualify for Government-Paid Maternity Leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few mothers who obtained citizenship for their child or who married their child's father, shortly after the child's birth have appealed to my Ministry asking that they too be eligible for Government-Paid Maternity Leave.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government-Paid Maternity Leave is an incentive scheme for intact families to have children who are Singaporean citizens.&nbsp; Whether the child is a citizen immediately at birth or shortly thereafter is inconsequential.&nbsp; Therefore, we are proposing to be more flexible by opening up Government-Paid Maternity Leave to mothers whose child obtains citizenship shortly after birth.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government-Paid Maternity Leave scheme should reflect our current social mores and norms.&nbsp; That is why mothers who give birth out of wedlock are not entitled to Government-Paid Maternity Leave.&nbsp; Having said that, our desired outcome is that children are brought up in intact families.&nbsp; Consequently, the proposed amendment allows for mothers who give birth out of wedlock, but regularise their situation by marrying their child's father shortly after birth to also be eligible for Government-Paid Maternity Leave.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As maternity leave is meant for the mother's physical recuperation and for her to care for and bond with her baby, the leave must be consumed within&nbsp;six months from the child's birth.&nbsp; Where the mother is married to the child's father before the child's birth, and the child is a <p align=left>Column: 1049<p>Singapore citizen at birth, the first&nbsp;eight weeks must begin no later than the day of confinement, but the last&nbsp;four weeks may be taken flexibly, subject to an agreement between the mother and her employer.&nbsp; This is in line with the Employment Act.&nbsp; A mother whose child is not a Singapore citizen at birth or who marries her child's father after the child's birth will also follow this leave structure, except that she will be eligible for Government-Paid Maternity Leave only from the day the child becomes a Singapore citizen or the day she marries the child's father, as the case may be.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This change will apply not just to employees, but to self-employed mothers as well.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Adoption Leave</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, now&nbsp;let me move on to Government-Paid Adoption Leave.&nbsp; An adoptive mother can consume&nbsp;four weeks of Adoption Leave in a continuous block or flexibly before the child turns&nbsp;six months, similar to the practice for maternity leave.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when we first introduced Adoption Leave in August 2004, adoptive mothers could only take the leave after the adoption order was granted.&nbsp; The whole adoption process can take&nbsp;four to&nbsp;eight months to complete.&nbsp; In the case of a foreign child, the child must also have obtained citizenship.&nbsp; Therefore, few mothers qualified for the leave.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During my Ministry's Committee of Supply Debate in 2005, my Minister announced that we will allow mothers to go on Adoption Leave at a much earlier point in the adoption process.&nbsp; A mother who has applied to adopt a Singaporean child may now take Adoption Leave from the time when the court appoints the Director of Social Welfare in MCYS as Guardian-in-Adoption of the child.&nbsp; In the <p align=left>Column: 1050<p>case of a child who is not a Singapore citizen at the time the adoption application is made, the Adoption Leave may be taken from the time when a Dependant's Pass has been issued for the child.&nbsp; This is almost the starting point where the child is physically with the adoptive family.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The change took immediate effect administratively from the date of announcement on 10th March 2005.&nbsp; We are now making the legislative amendments to formalise the change.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Children Development Account and Post-Secondary Education Account</I></p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than the changes to Government-Paid Maternity Leave and Adoption Leave, this Bill also contains a general amendment to the Baby Bonus scheme.&nbsp; The amendment would allow unused Children Development Account funds to flow through to another account in the child's name, and not just strictly to his Edusave account.&nbsp; This is in preparation for the introduction of the Post-Secondary Education Account, which the Prime Minister announced during National Day Rally 2005.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me take this opportunity to reiterate the point that making Singapore a great place for families cannot rely solely on the Government's efforts.&nbsp; While my Ministry will periodically review and refine our policies to ensure that they remain relevant and useful, employers and individuals have to play their part.&nbsp; More than just policies, programmes and infrastructure, moulding a family-friendly society requires values and mindset change.&nbsp; Let us all work together to realise our vision of making Singapore a great place for families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amendments provide greater clarity and remove some of the restrictions found in the existing law and are beneficial to women. Under the current law, entitlement to the paid maternity benefit will depend on the status of the mother or child at the time a woman gives birth.&nbsp; The amendment has modified this for the better.&nbsp; For example, with the amendment, a Singaporean woman whose baby is a non-citizen at birth can now enjoy the paid maternity benefit so long as the child becomes a citizen within the stipulated period.&nbsp; This is less onerous compared to the existing law, which denies the mother of the benefit if the child is not a citizen at birth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also support the amendment to section 2 which allows for the transfer of moneys standing in a member's bank account under the scheme to the Edusave Account or any other account as may be prescribed by the Minister.&nbsp; This provides for greater flexibility in the event that other uses are allowed for the moneys in view of recent suggestions on how continuing education can be supported by the Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are a couple of points which I wish to raise on the proposed amendments.&nbsp; Under the existing law, which is further refined by the amendment, the Government will reimburse an employer who has granted paid adoption leave to a female employee who has applied to adopt a child.&nbsp; This is an important benefit as it provides support to childless couples or&nbsp;those who want more children but cannot have more of their own.&nbsp; However, there are practical difficulties that affect the effectiveness of this benefit.&nbsp; Paid adoption leave is not a common benefit in Singapore, as many employers do not provide such a benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1052<p> For this benefit to be truly effective, more should be done to encourage employers to provide paid adoption leave.&nbsp; One enlightened employer that provides such a leave is the public sector.&nbsp; Under the public sector paid adoption leave scheme, a female employee who adopts a child is given four weeks of paid leave, subject to mutual agreement between the Ministry and the officer concerned.&nbsp; In the private sector, two good employers come to mind - UBSAG and Microsoft.&nbsp; These are two examples of companies in the private sector that I know of that provide paid adoption leave to their employees.&nbsp;UBSAG provides up to 15 weeks of paid adoption leave, while Microsoft offers one month of this benefit to their employees.&nbsp; I wish to urge more employers to follow the public sector and the example of UBSAG and Microsoft,&nbsp;so that more women can benefit from the scheme provided in our law.&nbsp; There is little cost to employers as the Government reimburses up to a certain number of days. But this could be an additional incentive for employers to recruit and retain talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next comment relates to section 9(3)(A) of the amendment as well as the existing section 3 of the Act.&nbsp; Both these sections provide that a pregnant female employee will not be entitled to the benefit if her employment is terminated due to whatever reasons.&nbsp; I feel that these provisions are harsh as they do not differentiate between situations where a woman loses her job because of her own fault, such as misconduct or when she voluntarily decides to leave the company during the benefit period, as against situations where she has no control, such as retrenchment,&nbsp;unfair dismissal or even upon expiry of her contract of employment in the event that she is on a short-term contract.&nbsp; I agree that when there is misconduct involved, then she should forfeit her entitlement.&nbsp; But in a situation such as retrenchment or unfair dismissal, for example, the job loss <p align=left>Column: 1053<p>is not due to the woman's fault, so she should not be penalised.&nbsp; This is one area which the law should provide greater flexibility and I hope that the Ministry could look into this,&nbsp;instead of a blanket prohibition, and assess it on its own merits.&nbsp; Otherwise, what happens is a perpetuation of two wrongs.&nbsp; First, a female employee is denied of the benefit under the Employment Act, which is then followed by a denial of the additional benefit under this Act.&nbsp; This is painful for a female employee as the income loss is significant at the time when she needs it most and she has an additional mouth to feed and is no longer employed.&nbsp; It also runs counter to the very purpose of this Act which is to encourage women to have more babies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, this law has already been in place for a couple of years but we do not have a sense as to its effectiveness and whether or not it has reached its objective of promoting procreation among women and families.&nbsp; Are the measures adequate or do we need to do more to help women to have more children and, if so, in what areas?&nbsp; Perhaps, it is time that the Ministry conducted a survey to assess the impact of this legislation, which is an important piece of social legislation and make refinements, where necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the amendments put forth in the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Generally, I am in support of the amendments proposed&nbsp;in the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp; It is the Government's policy that emphasises the importance of forming a family and children's development through the amendments to the adoption leave scheme, Government-paid maternity leave and Baby Bonus.&nbsp; Having a family is an important investment in Singapore because people are an important asset to the country.&nbsp; Therefore, assistance and incentive to the people&nbsp;are an investment by the Government for the future of the country.&nbsp; However, I suggest that we should take a more progressive approach to ensure that no one is left behind or neglected.</p><p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I feel that the assistance given must reach more than the first four children.&nbsp; True, this scheme is not a social assistance but it is more of providing a good headstart for the children.&nbsp;So I feel that we should not be concerned that, by extending this scheme, it would be seen as a social assistance to the lower-income families because there are already a number of specific assistance packages for them, like HOPE.&nbsp; In a family, there is a likely occurrence that children who are born later would not receive attention and benefits&nbsp; as good as their elder siblings and this is especially in the case of the middle and lower-income families.&nbsp; It is true that for families in this group, it is better for them to have a smaller family and do not burden the parents.&nbsp; However, if it happens that the family has more children, the children will be affected in the long-term.&nbsp; This may be detrimental to the country later because we are already having a low birth rate.&nbsp; Every child is important and they are our capital for our future.&nbsp; Every child has to be assisted to <p align=left>Column: 1055<p>become useful citizens and we should not limit what they could benefit from.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> (<I>In English</I>):  The second point which I think should be considered is to extend the Government-paid Maternity Leave (GPML) Scheme to include fathers as well.&nbsp; Recently, <I>The Straits Times</I> featured France's turnaround in its birthrate on 18th January 2007.&nbsp; One of the success factors is that&nbsp;incentives were granted to either the father or mother, regardless of gender.&nbsp; In fact, certain studies in Europe have also shown that in some highly industrialised countries, women are choosing to have more children because of the support they get from family members, particularly their husbands.&nbsp; In these countries, we also notice that fathers have benefits too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore's context, such a move is certainly very much in line to allow greater bonding between both parents and child.&nbsp; The role of the father is as important, particularly today, when both parents are working is commonplace.&nbsp; A father's role should not be seen as restricted mainly to one, ie, supporting the family financially.&nbsp; The Government should be more flexible in allowing either parent to be eligible for the leave scheme, particularly for the Government-paid component.&nbsp; Broadening the coverage of the GPML and&nbsp;adoption leave also sends the message that the role of the child's upbringing and bonding belongs to both parents, and this should apply, whether it is for adoptive or biological parents.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I think that the Government can also make provisions, should the mother pass on at delivery.&nbsp; Though not very common, I believe that fathers should then be able to benefit from these leave schemes.&nbsp; I am aware that I have also been pushing for a bit more flexibility in the implementation of this Bill, with the child's welfare at the centre of focus.&nbsp; But <p align=left>Column: 1056<p>I have also received feedback from the ground that on the extension of the Government-paid Maternity Leave Scheme to mothers who marry after the child is born could send the wrong signal to certain conservative parts of our society.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to pose a question to the Minister of State, because I am aware of MCYS' position on children out of wedlock and I would like to know how MCYS would plan to handle this sensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>6.33 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, clause 12A of the Children Development Co-Savings (Amendment) Bill states that the Government would reimburse any employer who has granted a married, widowed or divorced female employee paid leave of up to 24 days in connection with her adoption of a child below six months of age.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I applaud the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports for initiating paid adoption leave, as this is an official recognition that women who adopt children are helping to contribute more citizens to Singapore.&nbsp; These women are responding to the Government's procreation and pro-family policies in a different way, and their efforts should be saluted.&nbsp; This Ministry initiative will also send a strong signal that adopted children are treasured.&nbsp; It would go a long way to remove a stigma long associated with adopted children that they are second-class children within their own family as they are not born in it but adopted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I note that the proposed adoption leave could only be taken if the woman's employer agrees.&nbsp; I feel that leaving the discretion to the employer is as good as not having the leave in the first place, as I fear that many employers <p align=left>Column: 1057<p>would never agree.&nbsp; I would therefore urge the Government to consider making the 24 days' adoption leave mandatory and, at the same time, consider granting leave to the male employee as well because parenting is a joint responsibility of the husband as well as the wife.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current amendments grant any female employee, married, widowed or divorced, adoption leave only if she proactively seeks and obtains her employer's agreement.&nbsp; Should the employer disagree and disapprove of the request, the female employee will not be able to enjoy this benefit.&nbsp; Unlike mandatory maternity leave, adoption leave in this case is not compulsory and largely dependent on the organisation the female employee works in, ie, whether the organisation adopts pro-family policies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, many married employees choose to consider child adoption as their option primarily because they are unable to conceive after years of trying, and the decision whether to adopt is also not an easy one to make, and the consensus between spouses and their families is even harder to reach.&nbsp; The employees often expend much effort to try to adopt a child.&nbsp; In most cases, it does not come easy and, sometimes, it takes years before the adoption is finalised.&nbsp; When the adopted baby finally arrives at the adopted family's home, it is understandable that these employees, particularly the mothers, who are filled with joy, just like how first-time parents feel after the wives' delivery, would need much uninterrupted time to reorganise their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is reasonable to expect these employees' desires to want to be with their newly-adopted infants for the purpose of bonding and taking care of this new family member.&nbsp; Like any newborn babies, these adopted infants too need lots of assurance and love when they first arrive at the adopted family's home.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1058<p>Therefore, it is logical for these employees, particularly the female employees, to want to spend time with the adopted child for reassurance, especially the initial crucial months.&nbsp; Unfortunately, and realistically speaking, these female employees know that it is difficult to get the employers to agree because, to the employers, it is but an adoption of somebody else's child.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, making the leave mandatory would be a step forward in our modern and mature state with low fertility rates and consistent with the Government's drive towards a pro-family environment in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me at this stage to say a few words in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070122/20070122VS_112046.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.]&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I fully support the initiative by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to provide female employees desiring to adopt a child to be given paid leave.&nbsp; This will send a strong signal that the Government supports parents to adopt children when they cannot give birth to their own children, so that they can fulfil the dream of having a full family.&nbsp; Such a move can send a very strong signal, ie, that the adopted child will enjoy a certain status, particularly when we&nbsp;realise that an adopted child may sometimes&nbsp;not enjoy the kind of esteem as&nbsp;natural children.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Although we have such a legislation, I feel that, unfortunately, the Government should not leave the discretion of granting paid leave to the employers.&nbsp; In other words, the employers can decide whether or not to award such paid leave to the employee because, generally, the employers may not think that the adopted child would be as good as their own children.&nbsp; They can say they are only adopting other people's children, so there is no necessity for the employee to be given this paid leave to look after the child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1059<p> I feel that the Government should make it compulsory.&nbsp; Unless it is mandatory,&nbsp;the employee will never enjoy such paid leave, except for a small minority of companies which are very rational and sympathetic in granting such paid leave to their employees.&nbsp; To adopt a child for parents who are unable to conceive, it is a very important decision.&nbsp; They must have thought through this very thoroughly and have made all sorts of considerations before they decide to adopt, and they have to pay a big price for it because, once a child comes to the family, the child will also need some time to build up bonding with their adopted parents so that they can actually enjoy the fun of being members of a family.&nbsp; If after spending a lot of time and money and the parents could not enjoy such paid leave to be with the child, it is very regrettable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Government will consider making it mandatory so that, by law, employers should provide such paid leave to the employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In English)</I>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will now continue in English, on what other countries have done in this respect.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are aware that more and more societies have adopted pro-adoption policies in view of declining birth rates in most developed countries.&nbsp; For example, in Norway, the total amount of parental and adoption leave has been increased from 52 to 53 weeks at 80% of full pay, or from 42 to 43 weeks at full pay.&nbsp; In the UK, under the Paternity and Adoption Leave Regulations 2002, an employee, regardless of gender, enjoys ordinary adoption leave period of 26 weeks.&nbsp; In the USA, the federal government allows leave and work scheduling flexibilities for employees who adopt children.&nbsp; Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, each parent is also entitled to use a total of up <p align=left>Column: 1060<p>to 12 weeks of leave without pay for adoption and care of a newly-adopted child.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we can see from these overseas examples, there is an ever-growing trend in these societies to seek a balance between work and family commitments.&nbsp; I urge the Government to seriously consider making adoption leave mandatory, if not for the whole 24 days, then at least for 14 days as a start, and also to grant the fathers some leave as well so that, together, the family can truly experience the joy of parenthood.&nbsp; I am glad to know that the Government has actually provided for four weeks of paid maternity leave for adoption cases and I would urge the private sector employers to do likewise as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, adoption leave is intended for married employees, widowed, divorced or those who have fewer than four other living children.&nbsp; In considering the mandatory adoption leave, I would suggest that, for the single females who never married for various reasons but would want to adopt a child to form their own family</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I believe that for fathers who adopt children, they extend the same benefits to them as well.&nbsp; We highlight such enlightened companies in the private sector.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that the public&nbsp;sector should take the lead in many of these things.&nbsp;

I agree with some, but for the others, we cannot implement them for the time being.<p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I want to put the whole Bill in correct perspective.&nbsp; The objective of the Children Development Co-Savings Act is to encourage procreation and parenthood in the context of marriage, as the Government's view is that a two-parent family provides the best environment for our children to grow up in and to fulfil their potential.&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Zaqy Mohamad that the Government still believes in promoting marriages and promoting procreation within intact families.&nbsp; Therefore, for single mothers, we have not extended some of the benefits to them.&nbsp; However, single mothers still enjoy the 12-week maternity leave under the Employment Act and their children also enjoy equal treatment under KiFAS, CFAC, Edusave and also enrolment in schools.&nbsp; The mother can benefit from the Foreign Domestic Worker levy concession as well as child care leave and so on.&nbsp; Even for housing, the mother can also apply to buy or rent a flat from HDB jointly with her parents.&nbsp; Therefore, we have other assistance schemes to help them.&nbsp; Government-Paid Maternity Leave is not an assistance scheme.&nbsp; It is an incentive scheme to encourage intact <p align=left>Column: 1062<p>families to have children, and to have more children.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me address Members' comments and some of the questions that they have raised.&nbsp; I would like to thank Mdm Halimah for supporting the Bill.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has also encouraged employers to follow the public sector&rsquo;s lead to provide paid Adoption Leave.&nbsp; I am sure the public sector will take the lead.&nbsp; On Ms Ellen Lee's suggestion to make Adoption Leave mandatory, I would like to say that the paid maternity leave by the Government is primarily to allow the mother to recover from child birth.&nbsp; So the objective is actually recovery from delivery.&nbsp; But the Government is very kind and has extended this benefit to mothers who adopt as well.&nbsp; This only started in 2004.&nbsp; Let us try to implement this Bill first because, so far, according to my Ministry, there has been no complaint or appeal to make Adoption Leave mandatory.&nbsp; We will also work through our partners - NTUC, the Singapore National Employers Federation, MOM, the National Family Council, Centre for Fathering and so on - to encourage employers to grant the leave.&nbsp; I think the employers are quite receptive.&nbsp; MOM has also assured me that if there is any complaint, they will try their best to help convince the employer to give this leave to the adoptive mother.&nbsp; I am sure Singaporean employers or even MNCs are good community citizens.&nbsp; We call upon them to support the adoptive mother.&nbsp; Let us try this voluntary way to encourage employers.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the extension of Government-paid leave to fathers, I am very pleased that both of my male colleagues have called for fathers to play a more important role in bringing up their children.&nbsp; This is a good sign.&nbsp; In 2004, the Government allowed working fathers to have two days of Childcare Leave per year if the child is below seven years of age.&nbsp; And together <p align=left>Column: 1063<p>with the mother, they enjoy four days of Childcare Leave per year.&nbsp; This is only the beginning.&nbsp; I am sure that the National Population Committee, headed by DPM Wong, can look into the ways in which fathers can play a greater role in child raising.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On extending the Baby Bonus to beyond the fourth child, I would like to say that when we introduced the Act in 2001, we only extended the benefit to the second and third child.&nbsp; In 2004, we amended it to include the first and fourth child.&nbsp; The Government's stand is that, by doing so, we cover 98% of Singaporean families with children.&nbsp; Those families with a fifth child are in the minority.&nbsp; I should also say that most of them are from lower-income families.&nbsp; We do not encourage lower-income families to have more than four children because we hope that they can spend their limited resources on the three or four children and make sure that these children can really develop their potential.&nbsp; And if they cannot manage, they should not have more.&nbsp; Having said this, ComCare, Family Service Centres, CDCs and other schemes do help these families if they have more than four children.&nbsp; Those are assistance schemes.&nbsp; This is an incentive scheme and we do not encourage the lower-income families to have more than four children.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah is also concerned about the effectiveness of this incentive scheme and whether it has been working well.&nbsp; The Ministry carried out a survey last year.&nbsp; I think DPM Wong also announced the results in 2006.&nbsp; We have seen some encouraging signs.&nbsp; In the recent survey of 3,000 married respondents by MCYS, 83% of them indicated that the parenthood package has created a <p align=left>Column: 1064<p>friendlier environment for having and raising children in Singapore.&nbsp; In particular, the younger and higher income respondents were more likely to respond positively.&nbsp; 56% of the respondents also said that the parenthood package has influenced them to have or consider having more children, or have children earlier.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that it looks like the birth rate has presently stopped declining, and I hope that, maybe this year, we can see an upward trend.&nbsp; I thank the MPs for their suggestions and hope to further consider some of the points, especially getting fathers to share more parenting responsibilities.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In addition, a driver who is charged for very serious traffic offences such as causing death by dangerous driving (Sec 66 RTA) or causing death by a rash and negligent act (Sec 304A Penal Code) may have his licence suspended with immediate effect.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Road Traffic Act, a driving licence may be revoked if the driver is certified to be medically unfit to drive by a doctor.&nbsp; A driving licence can also be revoked if a new driver accumulates 13 or more demerit points or if he fails to display the Probation (P) plate twice within the 12-month period after obtaining his Driving Licence.&nbsp; If the driving licence is revoked, the person must wait a year before being allowed to take a driving test.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were 140 and 240 driving licences revoked in 2002 and 2003 respectively.&nbsp; In 2004, the number of licences revoked increased by 32% to 320.&nbsp; This was mainly due to new drivers who were caught for not displaying the P-plate twice or for chalking up 13 or more demerit points within the first year of obtaining their driving licences.&nbsp; Police has since worked with the driving schools to educate new drivers on traffic offences through their training packages, especially during the advance theory lessons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of driving licences revoked has since fallen to 170 in 2005, which is 48% lower compared to 2004.&nbsp; In 2006, the number of driving licences revoked was 90 as compared to the 170 licences revoked in 2005.&nbsp; This reduction was partly due to a significant reduction in the licences revoked for probationary drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traffic Police takes a strong enforcement stance against those who drive dangerously, including those who speed on our roads, as they not only put their own lives at risk but also the lives of other road users.&nbsp; Suspension and revocation of driving licences take such errant drivers off the roads and help contribute to the safety of other road users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1071<p>Besides enforcement, Police, supported by private sector partners, has been organising many public education programmes. Police launched the Road Safety Outreach 2006 (RSO 2006) in conjunction with the Police Week Carnival in June 2006 as part of its on-going road safety public education efforts.&nbsp; The launch of RSO 2006 kicked off a year-long series of road safety activities, such as exhibitions and workshops, reaching out to all categories of road users to heighten their awareness on the importance of road safety, including the dangers of speeding.</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1071<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The average numbers of new PRs and SCs are 38,700 and 8,300 respectively, for the period 2001-2005.&nbsp; We could expect to add about 200,000 new PRs and 40,000 new SCs in the next 5 years if we get the same numbers of new PRs and SCs as in the last 5 years.</p><p><br><I>Profile of immigrants</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many new PRs and SCs in Singapore were employment pass holders, usually graduates or diploma-holders who are skilled professionals or managers working in our strategic economic sectors such as the finance, biomedical sciences and creative industries. Beyond education qualifications, we also look for those with relevant experience and/or specific skills that can add vibrancy and diversity, and meet the needs of our economy. As the nature and needs of our economy change, we will adjust our requirements accordingly to ensure that new PRs and SCs fit the relevant profile.</p><p><br><I>Competition for talented migrants</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is not the only country grappling with population issues. Many countries are seeking suitable migrants to augment their population. For example, the US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong have programmes in place to target and attract suitable immigrants.&nbsp; Even Japan, traditionally a homogenous society, has begun to open its doors to non-ethnic Japanese immigrants.&nbsp; It was recently reported that there are more than two million such immigrants who are Japanese citizens today. The conclusion from this is clear &ndash; many countries are facing demographic challenges which will affect their economic vitality and viability if they are unable to augment their population and workforce. Immigration is a necessary and critical strategy in this regard.</p><p align=left>Column: 1089<p><p><br><I>Rationale for encouraging immigration</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our birth rate has been falling. In 2004 and 2005, we only had 1.25 babies born per woman, i.e. a Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 1.25. This is way below the 2.1 level needed to replace ourselves. Falling birth rates is a common phenomenon among many other countries. Since 2004, we have put in place a comprehensive marriage and parenthood package to encourage more resident births. Nevertheless, it would require an attitudinal change towards a more pro-family mindset among Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is unlikely that we will be able to reach the TFR of 2.1 to replace ourselves. This is why our approach to augmenting our population is three-pronged: encourage more Singaporeans to get married and have more babies; keep our overseas-based Singaporeans connected and committed to Singapore; and top up our population and workforce with suitable immigrants.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore must and will continue to welcome immigrants who can identify with our way of life and whose diverse talents can contribute to the vibrancy and viability of our country.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will monitor our population growth closely to ensure that the quality of life and well-being of Singaporeans will not be compromised as our population grows through careful urban planning and development.</p></p></span>\t<p align=left>Column: 1089<p>\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Adjustments can then be made to the market value of the property, to account for differences in attributes between the properties under comparison such as location, floor area, lease term, age, view, orientation and storey height.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB adheres to the above principle when pricing new HDB flats.&nbsp; Specifically, the prevailing market value of new HDB flats are assessed using recently transacted resale prices of similar flats in the vicinity, with appropriate adjustments factored in to account for differences in attributes.&nbsp; HDB then sells the new flats below their prevailing market values, so that flat buyers enjoy a market subsidy when they buy the flats.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB prices its flats relative to their market cost rather than development cost (i.e. the land and construction cost), so as to reflect the flats&rsquo;

To help eligible first-timers buy and own flats, HDB offers new flats at subsidised prices, and provides a CPF Housing Grant of $30,000 or $40,000 for those who choose to buy resale flats.&nbsp; HDB also offers mortgage loans at a concessionary interest rate to help buyers finance their flat purchase.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, HDB flats are very affordable to the vast majority of Singaporeans, including the middle income group.&nbsp; Over 70% of all HDB loan mortgagors service their monthly instalments fully from their CPF account.&nbsp; Another 10% use a combination of CPF and cash.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, the average new HDB flat buyer uses only about 20% of his monthly household income*&nbsp;to service his housing loan.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Government recognises that the lower income households may need additional help, given the economic pressures of globalisation. The Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) was thus introduced in March 2006 to provide further assistance to lower-income households to buy their first flat.&nbsp; The qualifying income ceiling for the AHG is set at $3,000, to ensure that the Government&rsquo;s limited public housing subsidies are prioritised to help families with more pressing needs.</p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

By offering teaching and learning approaches based on students&rsquo; different abilities and learning styles, it allows students to learn at an appropriate pace and progress as far as possible in their studies.&nbsp; This is how we have brought the attrition rate in schools down, to about 3% currently.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the years, MOE has been regularly reviewing and refining our approaches to streaming, so that we can help our students learn as best as they can.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1093<p> At the primary level, we have made several refinements to the system, including as Mr Liang has noted, the introduction of subject-based banding to replace the current EM3 stream, starting from 2008.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the secondary level, students currently take the Express, Normal (Academic) [N(A)] or Normal (Technical) [N(T)] courses.&nbsp; The N(A) course which Mr Liang asked about has allowed students who will have difficulty taking the &lsquo;O&rsquo; levels in four years to prepare for the &lsquo;N&rsquo; levels instead.&nbsp; Many of them go on to take their &lsquo;O&rsquo; levels in Secondary 5.&nbsp; By doing this over five years, they learn at a more comfortable pace, and are able to do better.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar to the primary level, we have been introducing greater flexibility for students in secondary schools.&nbsp; To cater to late developers, we allow for transfers between the Express, N(A) and N(T) courses.&nbsp; For the N(T) students, we now allow for lateral transfers after&nbsp;Secondary 2, and beyond.*&nbsp;&nbsp;N(A) and N(T) students are also able to take up to two of their subjects at a higher level.^&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 2,400 (or 20%) N(A) students sat for one or two &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level examinations while in Secondary 4 in 2005.&nbsp; From this year, schools that are ready have also been able to allow selected N(A) students&nbsp;to skip the 'N' level examinations altogether, and take a five-year course aimed at preparing them&nbsp;for their &lsquo;O&rsquo; level examinations.<sup>#</sup></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our secondary schools have introduced further innovations to customise learning for their students.&nbsp; For example, Dunman Secondary School has adopted a form of subject-based banding for their students.&nbsp; Secondary 3 N(A) students who are strong in Mathematics attend classes with the Express students, while Secondary 3 N(T) students who are good in Mathematics attend classes with the N(A) students.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will continue to review our secondary school landscape and streaming policies.&nbsp; We will learn from experience with the various flexibilities that have been introduced in schools, and explore ways to further refine secondary school education over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>*&nbsp;From 2005, there are provisions for lateral transfers to N(A) course i.e. Sec 2N(T) to Sec 2N(A), Sec 3N(T) to Sec 3N(A) and Sec 4N(T) to Sec 4N(A). This change resulted in an increase in the number of N(T) students promoted or transferred to the N(A) course, from 210 in 2004 to 370 in 2005.&nbsp; The year refers to when the transfer was effected, i.e. 370 N(T) students transferred from 2004 N(T) to 2005 N(A).<br> ^&nbsp;For a start, Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) and Mathematics were offered.&nbsp; In 2004, it was decided that the range of examinations that N(A) students could sit for be expanded to the full range of &lsquo;O&rsquo; Level subjects from 2006.

However, resources will always be limited while the wish list is infinite.&nbsp; We need to allocate more funds to those who need them more. Those who can afford to pay should contribute their share. This way, we make sure that more money is channelled to families who are less well-off. This is the basis for means testing. It will ensure that lower income families which require more assistance than higher income families get the assistance they need.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Means testing was not introduced to save the Government money.&nbsp; Rather, the government is committed to spending more on programmes for the disabled. As an example, the Government&rsquo;s contribution to Early Intervention Programmes for Infants and Children (EIPIC) and Community Integration Support (CIS) Programme, two programmes for children with disabilities, is expected to increase from $4.5 million in 2006 to $6.7 million in 2010. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) through the Community Chest has also committed $4.8 million this year and will continue to generously support these services in the coming years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, EIPIC fees continue to be affordable even after means testing.&nbsp; They range from as low as $10 per month for the lowest income group to about $200-$400 plus per month for those with family income exceeding $3,500.&nbsp; In fact, two centres have reduced fees for the lowest income parents by some $40-$70*.</p><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>*&nbsp;Asian Women&rsquo;s Welfare Association and Autism Resource Centre.</p><BR></div></P></div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<div align=\"left\"><p align=left>Column: 1099<p>We would like to reiterate that families who still face financial difficulties despite the subsidy from MCYS and ComChest can approach their Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) for help.&nbsp; The social workers from the VWOs will make an assessment and see how they can further help the family on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a family has more than one child with disability, they would enjoy a higher level of subsidy.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Many Helping Hands approach in ensuring a social safety net is in place has worked for us. Together, if each of us does our part - Government, Community and the Family - we can maximise the use of our limited resources and help more needy children with disabilities.</p></p></span><p><div align=left>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><p align=left>Column: 1101<p><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
