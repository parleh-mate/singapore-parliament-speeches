(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that in the past few\r\n\r\nyears  the Primary Production Department has  made\r\n\r\nuseful  contributions  towards  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\nagriculture.  For  instance,  the  Department  has\r\n\r\nintroduced   the  immunisation  of  poultry,   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of fine breeds and also the  teaching\r\n\r\nof  modern  and scientific methods of  agriculture\r\n\r\nand  poultry-keeping so as to benefit the farmers.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  are  faced with the  basic  problem,\r\n\r\nnamely,  the  shortage  of  land  for  agriculture\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Therefore,  we  have  to  depend  on\r\n\r\nimport  of  vegetables, fish, and other foods  for\r\n\r\nwhich we have to pay foreign exchange. Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the yearly foreign exchange that  we  spend\r\n\r\namounts   to  several  hundreds  of  millions   of\r\n\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of world-wide inflation and high\r\n\r\nprices   I   feel  that  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  should take up more responsibility  in\r\n\r\nthe provision of daily necessities so as to enable\r\n\r\nour  people to buy goods at reasonable prices.  In\r\n\r\nwhat  fields can the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nbe  of any service? I feel there are three aspects\r\n\r\nof  work  which  it  can  do:  (1)  the  extensive\r\n\r\nplanting of certain vegetables, including potatoes\r\n\r\nand  mushrooms,  in some villages  or  in  certain\r\n\r\nislands  so  as to lower the cost of  agricultural\r\n\r\nproducts; (2) to develop fresh water fish breeding\r\n\r\nand  deep-sea fishing so as to save some  tens  of\r\n\r\nmillion dollars on foreign exchange: and,  (3)  to\r\n\r\ndevelop a tropical fish market on a large scale in\r\n\r\norder  to  get  a  substantial amount  of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  for  our  country.  At  this   time   of\r\n\r\ninflation   I   feel  that  these  schemes   would\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  national  savings   and   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of new sources of income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that orchid growing is a new industry\r\n\r\nwhich will also bring in a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubstantial income. In recent years we  know  that\r\n\r\norchid  cultivation is making  great  progress  in\r\n\r\nrural areas. In our country, the history of orchid\r\n\r\ngrowing goes back to some 40 years. First, we must\r\n\r\ngive  credit  to  the authorities of  the  Botanic\r\n\r\nGardens  for  their efforts on orchid growing  and\r\n\r\ncultivation. Today many people have taken the  cue\r\n\r\nand have since been growing orchids. Today we have\r\n\r\nmany hybrids and varieties of quality orchids  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  well  known for orchid cultivation.  Even\r\n\r\nHawaiian  orchids are not comparable to ours  now.\r\n\r\nHere  the  Primary Production Department has  made\r\n\r\ngreat contributions. There is another aspect which\r\n\r\nwe  can be proud of. The Currency Board has chosen\r\n\r\nour orchids as the design for our currency notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a substantial amount of foreign\r\n\r\nexchange  through the sale of orchids. If  we  can\r\n\r\npay  more  attention to the development of  orchid\r\n\r\ngrowing  and a wider market, we will achieve  even\r\n\r\nmore.  Therefore, I would like to suggest  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  concerned to set up an  organisation  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  farmers  in the marketing  of  orchids.\r\n\r\nAccording to a survey, Europeans and Americans are\r\n\r\nfond  of orchids. For example, West Germany  alone\r\n\r\nexports   various  kinds  of  flowers  to  various\r\n\r\ncountries  amounting to S$850  million  per  year.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  calculation, our  total  export  of\r\n\r\norchids  is about US$6 to US$7 million,  which  is\r\n\r\nabout 3 per cent of that of West Germany, which is\r\n\r\nour  major market. In addition to this, there  are\r\n\r\nother   markets  in  West  Europe.  So   we   must\r\n\r\nintensively  develop our export markets.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest  to the Minister to set up a special  unit\r\n\r\nin  the Primary Production Department and vest  it\r\n\r\nwith special duties to develop foreign markets for\r\n\r\norchids  and other kinds of flowers. We  may  then\r\n\r\ngive more attention to our small farmers who plant\r\n\r\nflowers, so that they may be cared for and not  be\r\n\r\nexploited   by  the  middlemen.  Next,   we   must\r\n\r\nextensively   develop  the   methods   of   orchid\r\n\r\nplanting.  Though  we  are short  of  agricultural\r\n\r\nland,  we  still  have a certain number  of  farms\r\n\r\navailable for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   planting   of  orchids.   This   aspect   of\r\n\r\nagriculture has many good points. (1) It does  not\r\n\r\nlead  to  pollution  of the  air.  (2)  It  has  a\r\n\r\nbeneficial contribution towards water. (3) We  can\r\n\r\nearn  much  foreign exchange through  the  use  of\r\n\r\nsmall  capital  investment on non-productive  land\r\n\r\nand also utilising manpower to our benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope the Minister will urge the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department to  develop  this  type  of\r\n\r\nagriculture in order to get more foreign  exchange\r\n\r\nfor our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the present inflation  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhat  steps are being taken to produce and to grow\r\n\r\nmore  crops  locally? We cannot be self-sufficient\r\n\r\nin  all types of food products; but we can  be  on\r\n\r\nsome  of them. What effort is being made to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  self-sufficient in  poultry,  pigs,\r\n\r\neggs,  fish, etc.? With proper farming, we can  be\r\n\r\nself-sufficient in vegetables too.  If  those  who\r\n\r\nlive  in  houses with a garden are  encouraged  to\r\n\r\ngrow  vegetables, the inflated price of vegetables\r\n\r\nin  the markets can be lowered considerably.  Just\r\n\r\nto  quote an instance, today at the Kandang Kerbau\r\n\r\nMarket, the cost of two red chillies is 10  cents.\r\n\r\nNormally, you can get about 15 chillies  for  that\r\n\r\nprice. Imagine the difference in real value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear that our vegetable gardens are\r\n\r\ngradually   being   pushed  out.   What   is   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of  putting up vegetable  gardens  in\r\n\r\nflatted  farms?  Has  the Minister  thought  about\r\n\r\nthat?  The roof-top of every housing block can  be\r\n\r\nrented out to farmers to plant vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsome of my farmers in Potong Pasir are affected by\r\n\r\nurban  renewal. It is strange that  those  farming\r\n\r\nsome  0.5  hectare  of land,  or  less,  were  not\r\n\r\nconsidered  bona  fide  farmers  by  the   Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department. Because\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  this, they did not receive compensation\r\n\r\nnormally paid to bona fide farmers, either in  the\r\n\r\nform of cash, a free HDB flat, or alternative land\r\n\r\nto   cultivate.  I  cannot  fathom  the  rationale\r\n\r\ngoverning   the  Primary  Production  Department's\r\n\r\ndetermination  of  bona  fide  farmers   and   the\r\n\r\nnecessity to differentiate farmers. Is one of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  that  of avoiding paying compensation?  I\r\n\r\nwould  be most pleased if the Hon. Minister  could\r\n\r\nenlighten me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, a farmer is bona fide, whether he\r\n\r\ntills 0.5 or 1.0 hectare of land. He should not be\r\n\r\ndiscriminated against for being poorer. He  sweats\r\n\r\nand  toils, just tilling the land, perhaps harder,\r\n\r\nto   provide   Singaporeans  with   fresh,   green\r\n\r\nvegetables.  He has no other means  of  earning  a\r\n\r\nliving.  The Primary Production Department  merely\r\n\r\nconfuses  the poor hardworking farmer  by  telling\r\n\r\nhim that he is not a bona fide farmer. How can  he\r\n\r\nfigure   this  out  when,  in  actual  fact,   his\r\n\r\noccupation is farming? Imagine the farmer  willing\r\n\r\nto  assist  the Government by moving  out  of  the\r\n\r\nland,  which provides him with his livelihood,  to\r\n\r\nspend  the rest of his days in the confines  of  a\r\n\r\nHDB  flat,  and  yet  he is denied  the  right  of\r\n\r\ncompensation  as a farmer. Why is  the  Government\r\n\r\ndenying him this right to live and enjoy the  just\r\n\r\nrewards of his hard work by refusing to compensate\r\n\r\nhim as a bona fide farmer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong):</b> Sir, I have an\r\n\r\namendment* under this Head and since everybody  is\r\n\r\ntalking about agriculture, can I join in?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The amendment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head LK be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead CA 1111.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nsince  I  am  the  Member  of  Parliament   of   a\r\n\r\nconstituency, half of which is rural, I feel  that\r\n\r\nit  is  necessary for me to reflect in this  House\r\n\r\nthe  poor  plight of our farmers.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Chua Chu Kang will also have the  same\r\n\r\nfeeling, although he is not in the House yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, most of our farmers are rustic folks of\r\n\r\ngreat    forbearance.   They   are    law-abiding,\r\n\r\nhardworking, and their only aspiration in life  is\r\n\r\nto  earn  three  comfortable  meals  a  day.  They\r\n\r\nneither  play  with power, nor do they  manipulate\r\n\r\nour  market.  So  when there is a manipulation  of\r\n\r\nprices of farm products in Singapore, the greatest\r\n\r\nvictims of such manipulation are the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when prices of farm produce fall, who\r\n\r\nextends  a helping hand to the farmers?  But  when\r\n\r\nthere  is a slight rise in prices, everybody tries\r\n\r\nto  keep  it  down.  For  example,  a  scheme  was\r\n\r\nintroduced to stop slaughtering pigs for two  days\r\n\r\na  week, and there was even the lifting of  import\r\n\r\nduty  on  frozen  chicken and the lifting  of  the\r\n\r\nimport  ban  of  pigs from other countries.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  such measures, our farmers  have  been\r\n\r\nvery hard hit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world seems to be unduly\r\n\r\nharsh  and unfair to farmers in Singapore. We  are\r\n\r\nvery  hard hit by imported inflation and we cannot\r\n\r\ndo  anything  about  it.  The  20,000  farmers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore are also affected because they  have  to\r\n\r\npay  more for their daily necessities. In the case\r\n\r\nof  employed workers, they have the 9 per cent and\r\n\r\n$25 recommended by the National Wages Council. But\r\n\r\nwho  is  there to look after the poor farmers  and\r\n\r\nhelp them fight inflation? So it is fair that when\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  little rise in the  prices  of  farm\r\n\r\nproduce, attempts are made to suppress it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is becoming increasingly difficult to\r\n\r\nengage  in farming activities in Singapore because\r\n\r\nof  the diminishing returns of farm land. Although\r\n\r\na  lot of land has been acquired from the farmers,\r\n\r\nthey are resettled in a much smaller plot of land.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,   the  rate  of  compensation   still\r\n\r\nremains the same, despite the increase in the cost\r\n\r\nof  building construction and materials in  recent\r\n\r\nyears. This has also made it difficult for farmers\r\n\r\naffected by resettlement to build their own  farms\r\n\r\nand farm-houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our labour shortage has also\r\n\r\naffected farmers because it is difficult for  them\r\n\r\nto engage help on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfarm.  So  they will have to pay higher  wages  to\r\n\r\nengage  farm help. This is another item that  adds\r\n\r\nto their burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, furthermore there is the question of the\r\n\r\nrise  in  the  price of animal feed.  Animal  feed\r\n\r\ndealers  have  not only increased  the  prices  of\r\n\r\ntheir  products but they have also asked for  cash\r\n\r\nfrom  the farmers instead of allowing them credit.\r\n\r\nBecause of this difficulty, the cost of production\r\n\r\nhas definitely gone up, and if no help is rendered\r\n\r\nto  the poor farmers, I am afraid they will suffer\r\n\r\nin   the  end.  Sir,  if  what  is  left  of   our\r\n\r\nagriculture  cannot be developed or even  continue\r\n\r\nto exist, it will be a great tragedy for Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will mean that all the  consumers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will have to pay more for imported  farm\r\n\r\nproducts. The situation will then be much worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is quite right that because of\r\n\r\ngeographical  limitation,  we  do  not  depend  on\r\n\r\nfarming  and  agriculture for  a  living.  But  it\r\n\r\ncannot be denied that farming activities are  also\r\n\r\nan  asset to our national wealth because they help\r\n\r\nto solve our unemployment problem on the one hand,\r\n\r\nand  they  help  to  balance the  prices  of  farm\r\n\r\nproducts imported from overseas on the other hand.\r\n\r\nWithout  agricultural activities in our farms,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to pay at least 30 cents  for  an  egg\r\n\r\nimported  from abroad. Therefore, every assistance\r\n\r\nmust  be  given to our farmers to enable  them  to\r\n\r\nincrease   their   production,  so   that   higher\r\n\r\nproductivity  will help to bring down  prices  and\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of living in Singapore thereby  helping\r\n\r\nour consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our agriculture is now in great\r\n\r\ndifficulties. It is only the Government that is in\r\n\r\na   position  to  revive  agriculture   which   is\r\n\r\ndeclining in Singapore. I would like to take  this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  ask the Government  to  extend  a\r\n\r\nhelping   hand   to   the   development   of   our\r\n\r\nagriculture. It should not be allowed to  swim  or\r\n\r\nto sink by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong  in  regard to his views on agriculture  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past one or two years, many\r\n\r\ncountries  in  the world have suffered  from  food\r\n\r\nshortages. Worldwide inflation has affected all of\r\n\r\nus  in Singapore, particularly those who depend on\r\n\r\nimported  goods. The cost of living  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nhas also risen because of this. In respect of food\r\n\r\nsupply, the Primary Production Department has over\r\n\r\nthe  years encouraged farmers in Singapore to work\r\n\r\nhard  and  to help them with all kinds of  farming\r\n\r\naids.  As  a  result we have been able to  achieve\r\n\r\nself-sufficiency in the supply of  pigs,  chicken,\r\n\r\nand eggs. But because of the fantastic rise in the\r\n\r\nprice  of animal feed, the prices of farm products\r\n\r\nhave  also  been affected. So if we had  neglected\r\n\r\nour  agricultural sector, our cost of living would\r\n\r\nhave risen still higher, because we will then have\r\n\r\nto  depend  entirely  on the importation  of  farm\r\n\r\nproduce  and  other consumer goods as  well.  That\r\n\r\nwould  add  further  to what is  already  a  heavy\r\n\r\nburden on our people. Sir, if this had happened we\r\n\r\nwould  have  lost  at  least  by  way  of  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange. So the contribution made by our  farmers\r\n\r\ncannot be denied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next problem I would like to bring to the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  Minister is  the  question  of\r\n\r\nchange  of employment of our farmers. We all  know\r\n\r\nthat  most of our farmers in Singapore are in  the\r\n\r\nage  group  of 40 to 50. Because of  a  change  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  such  as  measures  taken  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  protect our water resources  which\r\n\r\nmake  it  difficult for farmers to carry on  their\r\n\r\nfarming  activities, then these farmers will  have\r\n\r\nno choice but to change their employment. But with\r\n\r\ntheir  limited  qualification and experience,  and\r\n\r\nage, it will be difficult for these old farmers to\r\n\r\nchange  their jobs. As a result, their  livelihood\r\n\r\nwill  become  problematic and, from the  point  of\r\n\r\nview  of  our  national economy,  that  will  also\r\n\r\nconstitute a great loss of our manpower.  Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis  my belief that our enlightened Government will\r\n\r\nnot  allow  our small and medium-size  farmers  to\r\n\r\nsink or to swim by themselves, and every help will\r\n\r\nbe given them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore has to import\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   good  number  of  agricultural  products  from\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries, and the prices  of  these\r\n\r\nagricultural  products  are  rising   higher   and\r\n\r\nhigher. In view of this fact, I am enquiring  from\r\n\r\nthe Hon.

We have to import most of our frozen meat\r\n\r\nfrom countries like New Zealand, Australia and the\r\n\r\nUSA.  The  prices  of frozen meat  have  increased\r\n\r\nconsiderably over the past year, thus contributing\r\n\r\nto  the  high  cost of living.

This  is\r\n\r\nobvious because there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth  disease sometime back and, as a result,  we\r\n\r\nhad  to slaughter about 400 head of cattle.  There\r\n\r\nhave also been complaints why we have stopped  the\r\n\r\nimport  of  cattle. The answer is obvious:  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of the foot-and-mouth disease.  Otherwise\r\n\r\nit will spread throughout Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the project on Batam island, we have\r\n\r\ninvested  nothing. It is completely an  Indonesian\r\n\r\nproject  with  Australian assistance -  Australian\r\n\r\ncattle.  The  cattle is already there.  If  it  is\r\n\r\nimported into Singapore, Batam island will be used\r\n\r\nas  a  quarantine station. In other words, if  the\r\n\r\ncattle there is free of the foot-and-mouth disease\r\n\r\nit  can then come straight into Singapore and  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily into our quarantine station in Jurong.\r\n\r\nAt  the  moment they are still breeding the cattle\r\n\r\non  Batam island. I do not think they have  enough\r\n\r\nhead of cattle for export to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Bukit Ho Swee, he wants to\r\n\r\nknow why we do not farm on the islands. There  are\r\n\r\nalready  some  farmers  in Pulau  Ubin  and  Pulau\r\n\r\nTekong. But it is not easy to get the farmers from\r\n\r\nthe  main  island  to farm on  the  other  islands\r\n\r\naround Singapore because it means transporting the\r\n\r\nproducts  across  the  sea. This  takes  time  and\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong made his usual speech on\r\n\r\nthe  Budget.  Can I deal with one point  that  was\r\n\r\nraised  by him, and that is, the question  of  the\r\n\r\nlifting  of  quota on chickens? This was  done  in\r\n\r\norder  to bring the price down. But this  was  not\r\n\r\ndone  by my Ministry because we are not in  charge\r\n\r\nof the quota. However, we have warned the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  of the dangers of leaving that  quota\r\n\r\ntoo  long. Our prime concern, like the Member  for\r\n\r\nJurong,  is the protection of our farmers.  Having\r\n\r\nseen  the  poultry industry grow to such a  strong\r\n\r\nposition that we export chickens and eggs  -  this\r\n\r\nwas not easily done, but done over many years - we\r\n\r\nare  naturally conscious to see that this industry\r\n\r\nis  not  affected by foreign competition. We  have\r\n\r\nalready  warned the Ministry of Finance  of  these\r\n\r\ndangers and we are keeping a finger on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir talked about bona\r\n\r\nfide farmers. If someone keeps a few chickens  and\r\n\r\na  pig in his backyard for the Chinese New Year or\r\n\r\nChristmas,  that  does not make him  a  bona  fide\r\n\r\nfarmer, especially if he works in Jurong or drives\r\n\r\na taxi. By a \"bona\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfide  farmer\", we mean a farmer who genuinely does\r\n\r\nfarming.  There  are, of course, genuine  or  bona\r\n\r\nfide  farmers.  But there are also people  who  do\r\n\r\nfarming  part-time just to have eggs for breakfast\r\n\r\nor chicken for the week-end. They do not depend on\r\n\r\nfarming completely as a means of subsistence,  and\r\n\r\nthat is why we say they are not bona fide farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson wants the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment to grow vegetables on the roof-tops  of\r\n\r\nHousing Board flats. It is an ingenious idea,  but\r\n\r\nit  has  practical difficulties.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  wants the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nto  find  a market for orchids. There are  already\r\n\r\nseveral  orchid  exporters in Singapore  who  have\r\n\r\ntheir  contacts overseas, and hence the export  of\r\n\r\norchids  brings in considerable foreign  exchange.\r\n\r\nBut   it   is   not  for  the  Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment to compete with these firms. No one  is\r\n\r\nprevented  from exporting orchids if he  can  find\r\n\r\nthe right contacts overseas. As for fishing, there\r\n\r\nis  a  Fisheries Research Station at Changi and  I\r\n\r\nwould  be happy to show the Member around.  If  he\r\n\r\ngoes there he will see that fish are reared. There\r\n\r\nare  also the giant fresh water prawns. The  young\r\n\r\nfish  and  prawns  are  sold  to  the  farmers  or\r\n\r\nfishermen for breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year the Primary Production Department is\r\n\r\nasked  to  help farmers. Well, it does help  them.\r\n\r\nBut  there is a shortage of land in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nthere are priorities. The town itself is expanding\r\n\r\nand with the creation of new towns like Toa Payoh,\r\n\r\nQueenstown and Woodlands, there is less  land  for\r\n\r\nfarming. But the Department is not asleep. It  has\r\n\r\nthe  Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory  at  Kampung\r\n\r\nJava which provides routine diagnosis of pigs  and\r\n\r\npoultry  which  have died. It finds  out  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong  and  tells  the farmers.  Specific  disease\r\n\r\ncontrol  schemes  are  conducted  by  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction  Department. There is also the  control\r\n\r\nof   pullorum  disease  in  poultry,   and   swine\r\n\r\nbrucellosis  in  pigs,  a  disease  which   causes\r\n\r\nabortions  in  fertility,  resulting  in  loss  of\r\n\r\nproduction.  We have a scheme which enables  farms\r\n\r\nto get rid of this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisease.   We   have  also  a  free  swine   fever\r\n\r\nvaccination   service,   a   poultry   vaccination\r\n\r\nservice, a plant protection service, and there are\r\n\r\n10   treatment   centres   strategically   located\r\n\r\nthroughout the island providing treatment services\r\n\r\nto  pig and poultry farmers on the island. We even\r\n\r\nhave  training facilities and both ad hoc training\r\n\r\nand   organised  training  are  conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment to enable farmers to learn more  recent\r\n\r\ntechniques   on  farming,  breeding  and   disease\r\n\r\ncontrol.  The  Farm  School at  Sembawang  is  one\r\n\r\nexample  of  organised training conducted  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment, it runs a one-year residential  course\r\n\r\nand  trainees  can choose one of  three  subjects,\r\n\r\nanimal husbandry, horticulture or fish culture for\r\n\r\nspecialisation.  The school  has  turned  out  173\r\n\r\ngraduates  who are now either managing  their  own\r\n\r\nfarms   or  gainfully  employed  in  the   primary\r\n\r\nproduction sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be interested to know that the\r\n\r\nDepartment has successfully experimented with  the\r\n\r\ncultivation of straw mushroom, and yields of up to\r\n\r\n15  per  cent of the weight of the growing  medium\r\n\r\nhave been obtained. The Department has also run  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  courses for the public, and there  are\r\n\r\nnow   a   few  commercial  farms  producing  straw\r\n\r\nmushrooms.  A limiting factor to this  development\r\n\r\nis  the  lack of padi-straws, the medium used  for\r\n\r\ncultivating  the mushroom. But the  Department  is\r\n\r\nnow   experimenting  with  substitutes,  such   as\r\n\r\nsawdust,  cotton  waste, coconut fibre  and  paper\r\n\r\nwaste. The results are inconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for hydroponics, the Department has\r\n\r\nsuccessfully experimented with the cultivation  of\r\n\r\nhigh  value  crops, such as capsicum,  under  this\r\n\r\nsystem.  Yields of up to one pound per  plant  per\r\n\r\ncrop  may be obtained, and with three crops  in  a\r\n\r\nyear.   The   Department  is  now  extending   its\r\n\r\nexperiments  to leafy vegetables, and  these  have\r\n\r\nshown  encouraging results. Yields are much higher\r\n\r\nthan  those produced from the conventional methods\r\n\r\nof cultivation. The Department is now intensifying\r\n\r\nits  efforts  to  transmit  its  findings  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fishing port at Jurong, Members will\r\n\r\nremember the opposition\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  met  when  the port was first opened  and  the\r\n\r\nfishmongers had to shift to Jurong. But I am happy\r\n\r\nto  say  that,  since  its  opening  in  1969,  an\r\n\r\nincreasing number of fishing vessels have made use\r\n\r\nof  the  port  facilities. The number  of  fishing\r\n\r\nvessels  visiting the port in 1973 was  only  387,\r\n\r\nand  last year numbered 659. The fishing port  has\r\n\r\nattracted  fishing vessels not only from  our  own\r\n\r\nRepublic but also those from Japan, Taiwan,  Korea\r\n\r\nand  Russia. About 2,000 local fishermen and 4,000\r\n\r\nfish  merchants  and retailers  make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket  facilities. Members will be interested  to\r\n\r\nknow   too  that  seven  factories  are   now   in\r\n\r\nproduction, producing filleted fish meat and  fish\r\n\r\nmeal for animal feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Sir, I was not talking about one pig,\r\n\r\ntwo  chickens and three ducks.

In any large establishment  there\r\n\r\nare  bound to be some black sheep. But amongst our\r\n\r\nnursing   corps,  I  found  that  the  number   of\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  staff is negligible.  Having  said\r\n\r\nthat,  I  would  like to point  Out  a  number  of\r\n\r\ngrievances of the hardworking nursing staff  which\r\n\r\ncan   be  rectified  without  much  cost  to   the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One very common grouse is that the quality of\r\n\r\nuniforms  and  shoes provided  is  generally  very\r\n\r\npoor. They are badly tailored, shoddily made, ill-fitting, and on top of it several trips have to be\r\n\r\nmade to the suppliers or contractors to obtain the\r\n\r\nrequired  uniforms or shoes. All this in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe fact that, I am sure, we pay these contractors\r\n\r\nand suppliers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr N.

Nor are they aware that sometimes  some\r\n\r\nnurses have to stump up from their own pockets  to\r\n\r\nsupplement their inadequate supply of uniforms and\r\n\r\nshoes.  For instance, district nurses and midwives\r\n\r\nhave  to make rounds to private homes in the rural\r\n\r\nareas, and they should therefore be supplied  with\r\n\r\nadditional shoes and uniforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that there are far too many\r\n\r\nAssistant  Nurses  with practically  no  promotion\r\n\r\nprospects at all in our Government health service.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, I am told there are only eight posts  of\r\n\r\nSenior  Assistant Nurses for the  1,800  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses  in  service  now. A  number  of  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses can and should be given the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nundergo  training  to  be Staff  Nurses.  Although\r\n\r\nthese   Assistant   Nurses  have   the   necessary\r\n\r\neducational  qualifications, they  have  not  been\r\n\r\ngiven the opportunity. One begins to wonder,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  this is not deliberately intended to ensure  a\r\n\r\nconstant supply of Assistant Nurses to provide the\r\n\r\nnecessary nursing service at a cut-rate salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Sir, because of the  limited\r\n\r\nnumber  of  post graduate vacancies and  to  avoid\r\n\r\ndelay in getting their post basic training in  the\r\n\r\npreferred  specialty, some Staff Nurses choose  to\r\n\r\ngo  abroad  on no-pay leave for such training.  On\r\n\r\nrejoining the service after completion of the post\r\n\r\ngraduate   course,   they  are  neither   accorded\r\n\r\nincremental    credits    for    the    additional\r\n\r\nqualifications obtained nor is their no-pay  leave\r\n\r\nperiod considered in the pension calculations. The\r\n\r\nadditional qualifications they have obtained, Sir,\r\n\r\nbenefit   the  service  and  yet  they  lose   out\r\n\r\nfinancially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have noticed that in the hospital wards,\r\n\r\nin  many instances, there is only one Staff  Nurse\r\n\r\nin  each shift duty, the rest are Assistant Nurses\r\n\r\nor  Student  Nurses. If more than one  patient  is\r\n\r\ntaken  seriously ill, or if two or three  patients\r\n\r\nare  critical, then pandemonium prevails.

Although this system has been implemented\r\n\r\nin  some hospitals there are other hospitals which\r\n\r\nstill  follow the old seven-night shift system.  I\r\n\r\ndo not know why this is so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

I  agree with the Government that  whoever\r\n\r\nmakes use of the medical services must pay a token\r\n\r\nshare  towards  the cost, to check  abuse  in  the\r\n\r\nunnecessary  use  of  these  services.  A  patient\r\n\r\nvisiting  the out-patient clinic pays $2 (the  fee\r\n\r\nis $3 at the General Hospital) on his first visit,\r\n\r\nand  quite  often the doctor asks the  patient  to\r\n\r\ncome back for further check-ups or treatment.  All\r\n\r\nthese  subsequent visits cost $2 each. Such second\r\n\r\nvisits,   where  the  doctor  sees   whether   the\r\n\r\nprescribed treatment is correct or effective,  can\r\n\r\nlast  only 5 or 10 seconds. The patient still pays\r\n\r\nthe usual charges. There are also occasions when a\r\n\r\ndoctor  refers his patient to another unit on  the\r\n\r\nsame  day, and yet the patient has to pay  at  two\r\n\r\nplaces,  though it is for treatment  of  the  same\r\n\r\nsickness. Is it possible to waive the charges  for\r\n\r\nthese  second visits, or at least reduce  them  in\r\n\r\norder  to reduce the strain on the pockets of  the\r\n\r\npoor?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Service in Singapore must be one of\r\n\r\nthe  most  unpopular professions for any  aspiring\r\n\r\nyoung  man  of  Singapore.

How\r\n\r\ncan a doctor perform his best during the second 12-hour   shift,  when  he  would  have  been   tired\r\n\r\nphysically  and  mentally?

He has raised this matter\r\n\r\nof  uniforms of nurses. As a matter of  policy,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to assure him, first of all, that it is\r\n\r\nnot  my  policy to issue ill-fitting uniforms  and\r\n\r\nill-fitting shoes to our dedicated nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just move on to the other matters which\r\n\r\nhave been raised? The first point he has raised is\r\n\r\nthat  there are too many Assistant Nurses  around,\r\n\r\nand  he  thinks  that we are taking  in  too  many\r\n\r\nAssistant Nurses in order to exploit them. That is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not true. In fact, it is not true  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  more  Assistant Nurses than  qualified\r\n\r\nStaff Nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Member has brought up\r\n\r\nis   that   Assistant  Nurses  have  very   little\r\n\r\nprospects  for  promotion or  transfer  to  become\r\n\r\nstudent Staff Nurses. In fact, there is no lack of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npromotional  prospects for  them.  Promotion  from\r\n\r\nAssistant Nurse to Senior Assistant Nurse is based\r\n\r\non  merit and not necessarily based on the  number\r\n\r\nof  vacant posts. There are also opportunities for\r\n\r\nAssistant  Nurses who do well in  examinations  to\r\n\r\njoin as student Staff Nurses in the second year of\r\n\r\nthe  three-year Staff Nurse course. This is  again\r\n\r\nbased  on examination results. Those who score  70\r\n\r\nper  cent  and  above are allowed  to  join  these\r\n\r\ncourses.  Another  opportunity also  is  given  to\r\n\r\nserving Assistant Nurses who have failed to  score\r\n\r\n70  per  cent  but on the basis of good  work  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to  join the student Staff Nurse  course.\r\n\r\nThey are paid full salary while on this course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point raised is the three-night shift\r\n\r\nsystem for nurses in our hospitals. As a matter of\r\n\r\nfact, the Ministry of Health agreed to reduce  the\r\n\r\nseven-night duty cycle to a three-night duty cycle\r\n\r\nfor  nurses. This was agreed to in principle  with\r\n\r\nthe union concerned, with the qualification that a\r\n\r\npilot  scheme  should, in the first  instance,  be\r\n\r\nintroduced at the Outram Road General Hospital. To-date,  some hospitals have been able to  implement\r\n\r\ncompletely  this three-night duty cycle  They  are\r\n\r\nthe   Outram  Road  General  Hospital,  Middle-ton\r\n\r\nHospital,  and  the  Trafalgar  Home.  Some  other\r\n\r\nhospitals, however, like the Woodbridge  Hospital,\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau Hospital, and Thomson Road General\r\n\r\nHospital have partially introduced the three-night\r\n\r\nduty  shifts.  The point is that  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health that does not want to introduce\r\n\r\nthe  three-night shift in all the  hospitals.  The\r\n\r\nreason  why some hospitals have not introduced  it\r\n\r\ncompletely  is due to the shortage of  staff.  The\r\n\r\nMember can be assured that in due course the three-night  shift  duty  will  be  introduced  in   all\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to granting of no-pay leave to nurses\r\n\r\nwho  wish  to  go  overseas for  their  post-basic\r\n\r\ncourses, the selection for granting this leave  is\r\n\r\nbased on the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The training course must be directly related\r\n\r\nto  the  development and expansion of the  medical\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The course can be recognised for both post-basic increment, and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The course is not available locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor  the information of the Member, for the  years\r\n\r\n1972  and  1973, only two applications for  no-pay\r\n\r\nleave  to  go  on  a post-basic course  have  been\r\n\r\nturned   down.  In  1972,  31  applications   were\r\n\r\nreceived, of which only one was turned down.  This\r\n\r\napplicant wanted to apply to go on a course  at  a\r\n\r\ntime  when many of her contemporaries were already\r\n\r\nabroad completing a course in plastic surgery. For\r\n\r\nthe  1973  case,  the  applicant  was  advised  to\r\n\r\nproceed on other types of courses which would meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs of the medical services. But as she was\r\n\r\nadamant   on  her  choice,  her  application   was\r\n\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the promotion of those who have\r\n\r\nobtained this post-basic qualification, may I  say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not possible to promote everyone  who\r\n\r\nhas  this post-basic qualification. In a promotion\r\n\r\nexercise other considerations have to be met with.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  not every post-basic qualification  can\r\n\r\nbe  recognised. As far as nurses going abroad  are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  they are always advised  as  to  which\r\n\r\npost-basic qualifications are recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ill-fitting uniforms and shoes,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say  that  uniforms and  shoes  are  being\r\n\r\nsupplied  by a contractor. May I stress  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  uniforms are made to measure. They  are  not\r\n\r\nready-made  uniforms. If, after  measurement,  the\r\n\r\ntailor  does  not give a fitting uniform  then  he\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  re-cut it at the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\ncontractor. Similarly with shoes. Therefore, it is\r\n\r\nnot true to say that we are not aware of the fact.\r\n\r\nBut  such errors do occur sometimes, and when they\r\n\r\ndo the contractor has to make good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to fixed allowance for midwives, may\r\n\r\nI  say that midwives serving in the City districts\r\n\r\nare  paid  $60 per month and those in the outlying\r\n\r\ndistricts are paid $70 per month. Those serving in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas are paid $55 a month.  This,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  you can see, is an anomaly  inherited\r\n\r\nfrom the former City Council and the Rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBoard, which paid different rates. The question of\r\n\r\nfixed allowances is now under review. Fortunately,\r\n\r\nno  decision  has been arrived at, at the  moment,\r\n\r\nand  because of the rise in fuel prices and  taxi-fares it has been necessary to restudy the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson, may I just enlighten him on the $3 and\r\n\r\n$2 charges. A $2 fee is charged for each treatment\r\n\r\nin an ordinary outpatient dispensary, but a $3 fee\r\n\r\nis  charged  if  one  attends a specialist  clinic\r\n\r\nattached  to  our  hospitals.  There  is  no  such\r\n\r\ndirective  as  the Finance Minister  saying,  \"You\r\n\r\ncharge  $2  in  this  hospital  and  $3  in   that\r\n\r\nhospital.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the increase in hospital fees. I\r\n\r\nam  glad  the  Member for Anson  agrees  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  policy that whoever uses  the  medical\r\n\r\nservices  should  pay a token sum  towards  costs.\r\n\r\nThis helps to check the abuse of these facilities,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps instilling in our people an awareness\r\n\r\nthat  nothing is for free. However, it is not true\r\n\r\nto say that doctors often request patients to come\r\n\r\nback  for check-ups after treatment. Requests  for\r\n\r\npatients  to come for second visits are only  made\r\n\r\nwhen necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point about doctors being on\r\n\r\ncall for 24 hours, may 1 enlighten the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson that this 24-hour on call duty is also  true\r\n\r\nof  doctors  the  world over,  and  certainly  not\r\n\r\r\npeculiar  to Singapore. However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  that it does not necessarily follow that  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  do  not sleep during such  24-hour  duty.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Member for Kim Seng can enlighten  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  on this matter.  Nevertheless,\r\n\r\ndoctors who are on call duty are given the day off\r\n\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the resignation of doctors, I may\r\n\r\nhave something more to say when the Member for Kim\r\n\r\nSeng  raises the matter under a different subhead.\r\n\r\nSo I do not think I will deal with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  in  detail now. But may I just say that  there\r\n\r\nare  many  reasons  for a doctor  to  resign  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  service.  It may  not  necessarily  be\r\n\r\nassociated only with working conditions.  Some  go\r\n\r\nout to be in private practice because they believe\r\n\r\nthat they can earn more money. In fact, those  who\r\n\r\nare  in  private practice may have  to  work  even\r\n\r\nharder,  particularly when they  are  starting  to\r\n\r\nestablish  their  practice.  On  the  analysis  of\r\n\r\nresignation,  Sir,  among  the  doctors  who  have\r\n\r\nresigned there are those who do not go on  24-hour\r\n\r\ncall  duty at all, particularly those who work  in\r\n\r\noutpatient dispensaries and school health clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the amendment to the Medical\r\n\r\nRegistration  Act which the Member for  Anson  has\r\n\r\nraised. The major change in the amendment  to  the\r\n\r\nAct is that we now have a local list of recognised\r\n\r\nmedical  qualifications. In other  words,  persons\r\n\r\nwith  qualifications which are not on  this  list,\r\n\r\nhowever,  may  be registered by the order  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister  after they have satisfied the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical  Council that they have reached a standard\r\n\r\nof  competence to practise independently. Normally\r\n\r\nthe  Medical Council makes its recommendations  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister, under the provisions of the new Act.\r\n\r\nThe person would have to go through an examination\r\n\r\nset by the Medical Council to test his competency.\r\n\r\nThis is quite important because we are letting him\r\n\r\nfree  to practise independently, and if he is  not\r\n\r\ncompetent he will endanger the health and life and\r\n\r\nlimb  of  members  of  the public.  In  1972,  two\r\n\r\npersons   who   did   not  have   the   recognised\r\n\r\nqualification were so examined. One passed and was\r\n\r\nrecommended for registration. In 1973, there  were\r\n\r\nsix  persons who applied for registration and were\r\n\r\nexamined.   One  was  successful  and   has   been\r\n\r\nregistered.  This  year  one  applicant  will   be\r\n\r\nexamined in March/April, and six others have asked\r\n\r\nto be examined in September 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, although the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  it  is not his policy to  supply  ill-fitting uniforms and so on,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  point  made  is that public funds  are  being\r\n\r\nutilised  to  supply  these  uniforms.  We  expect\r\n\r\npublic  funds  to  be properly  utilised.  If  the\r\n\r\ncontractor  supplies ill-fitting uniforms,  though\r\n\r\nthey are made to measure, I suppose something  has\r\n\r\nto  be  done  to see that we get a contractor  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not supply ill-fitting uniforms in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that made-to-measure uniforms are called\r\n\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also raised the problem of nurses in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas. They ought to be provided with  more\r\n\r\nuniforms because they are out on the field. Nurses\r\n\r\nin  hospital  work  within  the  confines  of  the\r\n\r\nhospital  and  perhaps they do not  need  as  many\r\n\r\nuniforms as those who work in the outlying areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is good to hear that promotions from\r\n\r\nAssistant Nurses to student Staff Nurses and Staff\r\n\r\nNurses are based on merit. The word \"merit\" can be\r\n\r\ninterpreted  in  many ways. Perhaps  it  would  be\r\n\r\nbetter   if   the  number  of  promotional   posts\r\n\r\navailable  is  made known as that would  at  least\r\n\r\ngive the nurses an opportunity of knowing what  to\r\n\r\nexpect  when applying for these promotional posts.\r\n\r\nAs  was  pointed  out, there are  1,800  Assistant\r\n\r\nNurses with only eight promotional posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister agreed with me that there is a\r\n\r\nshortage of nurses and that is why the Ministry is\r\n\r\nnot able to implement the three-night shift system\r\n\r\nalthough they accept that it is a better system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> In all hospitals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, in all hospitals. It has\r\n\r\nbeen  done  in some hospitals. But for  the  other\r\n\r\nhospitals, they are not able to do it because they\r\n\r\nare  short of nurses. That is the point I am  also\r\n\r\ntrying  to make - shortage of nurses. What is  the\r\n\r\nMinister  going to do about it? I thought  I  even\r\n\r\npointed out that there was an occasion that I know\r\n\r\nof  when  there was only one Staff Nurse  and  the\r\n\r\nrest  were  either  Assistant  Nurses  or  student\r\n\r\nnurses.  This  is  not  a  satisfactory  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should congratulate the Minister when he said\r\n\r\nthat about 30 nurses were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven  leave to do post-basic courses. This  bears\r\n\r\nout  the  point that these post-basic courses  are\r\n\r\nnecessary,  and the fact that he gave  the  nurses\r\n\r\nleave  to  do this post-basic course on their  own\r\n\r\nshows  that this post-basic training is necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd  as the Minister has said, when they come back\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  promotional  posts  available.  My\r\n\r\nquarrel  is not about promotional posts not  being\r\n\r\navailable. But after they have utilised their  own\r\n\r\ntime and their own money to go through an approved\r\n\r\ncourse  -if it is not approved, he would not  have\r\n\r\ngiven  them  no-pay leave - when they  come  back,\r\n\r\nthey   should  at  least  be  given   the   annual\r\n\r\nincrement.  No,  they do not get it.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will  give  some consideration  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  and perhaps let me know why this  is  not\r\n\r\nbeing done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\nalready  explained the position. As far  as  post-basic qualifications for nurses are concerned, not\r\n\r\nall  of  them,  in  particular Staff  Nurses,  are\r\n\r\nentitled to an increment. But most of the  courses\r\n\r\ndo entitle the nurses to an increment. If they are\r\n\r\nentitled to it, they would have got it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point made by the Member for Telok\r\n\r\nBlangah  is  that  too many Assistant  Nurses  and\r\n\r\nStudent  Nurses  are around, and  not  many  Staff\r\n\r\nNurses.  Let  me  just give him the  figures.  The\r\n\r\nstudent nurse population as at 1st March, 1974, is\r\n\r\n763,  as  compared to 2,182 qualified  nurses.  In\r\n\r\nfact, each ward has a team of an average of 19  to\r\n\r\n20 nurses, made up of Sisters or Nursing Officers,\r\n\r\nStaff  Nurses, Assistant Nurses and Student Nurses\r\n\r\nat various levels of training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as shortage of nurses is concerned, every\r\n\r\nattempt  has  been  made to  expand  the  training\r\n\r\nschool  of nurses, and we have been getting larger\r\n\r\nintakes  in the last year or two, in view  of  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of our medical services.  But,  as  you\r\n\r\nknow, whatever calculations we make with regard to\r\n\r\nintake  and projection, if we expand too fast,  as\r\n\r\nwe  do  at  the  moment, there is bound  to  be  a\r\n\r\nshortage of manpower, including\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnurses.  But the Member for Telok Blangah  can  be\r\n\r\nassured that we are training as many nurses as  we\r\n\r\ncan  at the moment. In fact, when our calculations\r\n\r\nwere  made, they were based on a seven-night shift\r\n\r\nduty.    But   now   because   of   the    union's\r\n\r\nrepresentation, we thought it reasonable and  have\r\n\r\nchanged it to a three-night shift. But surely  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Blangah cannot expect us  to  do\r\n\r\nwonders  and  increase  the population  of  nurses\r\n\r\novernight. We do what we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> The union must co-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> And as my colleague says, the\r\n\r\nunion must also co-operate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In  fact,\r\n\r\neven  if  the Member for Telok Blangah goes  to  a\r\n\r\ntailor,  he  does not expect a right  fit  on  the\r\n\r\nfirst fitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

In any case, the contractor\r\n\r\nwho  gives the ill-fitting uniforms will be  asked\r\n\r\nto  change  again and again, and that  will  incur\r\n\r\nmore   expense  on  his  part.  So  that  is   his\r\n\r\npunishment.  Of  course, if he has been  producing\r\n\r\ntoo  many  ill-fitting uniforms, he  can  be  rest\r\n\r\nassured that he will not get the contract when the\r\n\r\nnext tender comes up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Moreover, the measurements  are\r\n\r\nnot taken properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey just sew the uniforms and supply them  to\r\n\r\nthe nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister about the\r\n\r\ncharges of $2 and $3. Why is there this difference\r\n\r\nin   charges   between  outpatient   clinics   and\r\n\r\nhospitals? I do not know the reason. If  a  person\r\n\r\ngoes  to a hospital, he is charged $3, but charged\r\n\r\n$2  if he goes to a clinic. The Minister has  also\r\n\r\npromised  that a person will be charged only  once\r\n\r\nif  he  goes to an outside clinic and pays $2  and\r\n\r\nthen  subsequently he is required  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  hospital  again  on  the  same  day.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has promised that a person will  not  be\r\n\r\ncharged  twice  in  the  same  day  for  the  same\r\n\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nnot  understood me. I have never made any promises\r\n\r\nas  far as charges are concerned because they  are\r\n\r\nlevied according to the manual which is not put up\r\n\r\nby  me.  But  if patients are to be charged,  they\r\n\r\nwill be charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the difference between $3 and $2,\r\n\r\nI  think  I  might have to take half  an  hour  to\r\n\r\nexplain   to   the  Member  for  Anson   for   his\r\n\r\nenlightenment.  This  is in regard  to  specialist\r\n\r\ntreatment for injuries and treatment of coughs and\r\n\r\ncolds. Perhaps the Member for Kim Seng could  help\r\n\r\nme   explain  to  the  Member  for  Anson  outside\r\n\r\nParliament   the  difference  between   specialist\r\n\r\ntreatment and a simple outpatient service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe  invitation of the Hon. Minister, I  certainly\r\n\r\nshall explain it to the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to put on record the point made\r\n\r\nby  the Hon. Minister regarding the working  hours\r\n\r\nof  doctors in hospitals. I should hate to have it\r\n\r\nthought  that, in actual fact, doctors sleep  when\r\n\r\nthey  are on night calls. As a matter of  fact,  I\r\n\r\nthink  the Minister could bear me out when  I  say\r\n\r\nthat  doctors in hospitals work seven days a week,\r\n\r\nSundays and public holidays included. And many  of\r\n\r\nthem  go  on night calls, at least twice,  if  not\r\n\r\nthree times\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  sometimes four times a week. This means  that\r\n\r\nthey  start work at 8.00 in the morning, work  the\r\n\r\nwhole  night  through till 8.00 the next  morning,\r\n\r\nand  continue  till 2.00 p.m, the  following  day,\r\n\r\nwhich  means  putting in at least 30  hours  at  a\r\n\r\nstretch, depending on the exigency of the  service\r\n\r\nwhen they may not be released until 5.00 p.m, the\r\n\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point\r\n\r\nabout  sleeping on duty? What I said was this.  If\r\n\r\nthey  are on call duty, it does not mean that they\r\n\r\ncannot sleep. When they are on call duty, they can\r\n\r\nsleep but have to wake up when somebody calls  the\r\n\r\nbleep.  It  is very foolish while on 24-hour  call\r\n\r\nduty  to  keep waiting for the bleep. I think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kim Seng understands what I have  been\r\n\r\ntrying to put across.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point that they work long\r\n\r\nhours,  the  situation was worse before,  but  not\r\n\r\nnow.  Because of the protests and so on,  we  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  system whereby if a  doctor  is  on\r\n\r\nnight  duty  he  gets  an  afternoon  off  on  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  day. I cannot say that this system  has\r\n\r\nbeen  followed  in every case,  but  it  has  been\r\n\r\nfollowed  in the vast majority of cases.  But,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, being doctors they have to respond to  the\r\n\r\nexigencies of the service. In fact, I know that in\r\n\r\na  few specialities, like surgery, obstetrics  and\r\n\r\ngynaecology, they have to work longer  hours  than\r\n\r\nin   the  other  specialities,  maybe  orthopaedic\r\n\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

However,  it  is\r\n\r\nadmitted  that  strict control  on  the  purchase,\r\n\r\nstorage   and  sale  of  sodium  hydroxide   (more\r\n\r\ncommonly  known  as caustic soda) by  the  Poisons\r\n\r\nInspectorate  is indeed necessary as caustic  soda\r\n\r\nis still one of the favourite suicidal poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule (3) of the Poisons (Sodium Hydroxide) Rules,\r\n\r\n1958, states that \"it shall not be lawful to  sell\r\n\r\nsodium  hydroxide  unless the  purchaser  holds  a\r\n\r\npermit (i.e. Form E) to purchase same\". Under  the\r\n\r\nPoisons  Ordinance a holder of Form A is  licensed\r\n\r\nto  import  and  store poisons, and presumably  is\r\n\r\nallowed  for  his own use but he cannot  sell.  To\r\n\r\nsell, he requires to possess Form C. It is further\r\n\r\ncomplicated  that while a holder  of  Form  A  can\r\n\r\npurchase   caustic  soda  from  anywhere   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he  is not allowed to purchase  within\r\n\r\nSingapore unless he simultaneously possesses  Form  E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an emergency, such as shipping delay or\r\n\r\nout-of-stock situation, an industrial  firm  using\r\n\r\ncaustic  soda cannot temporarily buy caustic  soda\r\n\r\nlocally  unless he possesses Form E  as  explained\r\n\r\nabove. In this acute situation where a seller,  in\r\n\r\nhelping out an emergency, contravenes the law,  he\r\n\r\nis  prosecuted  in  court. A few  \"good-intention\"\r\n\r\nsellers have landed in court and their rice  bowls\r\n\r\nbroken  in  performing a samaritan act.  To  avoid\r\n\r\nthis  situation and perhaps the only solution  for\r\n\r\nthe  industrial firm using caustic soda is to stop\r\n\r\nproduction   and   await  the  approval   of   his\r\n\r\napplication for Form E which normally takes  three\r\n\r\nor four weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Director of Medical Services\r\n\r\nappears to have taken a retrogressive step in that\r\n\r\nlicensees cannot simultaneously hold both  Form  A\r\n\r\nand  Form  E.  This makes matters  worse  and  the\r\n\r\nindustrial  sector  is  badly  inconvenienced  and\r\n\r\nsimply  cannot understand this illogical decision.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth  and  Home  Affairs explain  the  rationale\r\n\r\nbehind this confusing state of affairs?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this confusing situation in the control\r\n\r\nof  caustic soda, may I suggest that the  relevant\r\n\r\nRules  be  amended and the procedure  streamlined.\r\n\r\nLike  many countries elsewhere, it appears obvious\r\n\r\nthat  the  holder of Form A should be  allowed  to\r\n\r\npurchase caustic soda from both outside and inside\r\n\r\nSingapore,  subject  to  any  reasonable   control\r\n\r\nprocedure the Ministry of Health think fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise concerns\r\n\r\nthe  strict  enforcement of labelling requirements\r\n\r\nfor  all  scheduled poisons controlled  under  the\r\n\r\nPoisons  Act  and Poisons Rules. Here  again,  the\r\n\r\nPoisons Inspectorate is too rigid and do not allow\r\n\r\nany  degree  of flexibility within  the  scope  of\r\n\r\npeople who are suitably qualified or authorised to\r\n\r\nhandle the use and sale of poisons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most instances, imported poisons are already\r\n\r\nlabelled  with  the word \"Poison\" in  the  English\r\n\r\nlanguage.  In  these cases, exemptions  should  be\r\n\r\ngranted to sales made to trading and manufacturing\r\n\r\nfirms with knowledgeable, qualified and authorised\r\n\r\npersonnel, in  the case of poisons  sold  to  the\r\n\r\npublic   (e.g, at  retail  pharmacies),   it   is\r\n\r\nunderstandable  that the word \"Poison\"  should  be\r\n\r\nwritten in the four languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, importers have to label these\r\n\r\npreparations  when they sell them  to  the  trade.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  moment these goods  arrive  at  the\r\n\r\nretailers  they in turn paste their own  label  on\r\n\r\nit. Usually, the first label is either removed  or\r\n\r\nsuperimposed by the second label. This is  because\r\n\r\nthe  name  and  address of the seller  has  to  be\r\n\r\nincluded in the label at each stage. The label put\r\n\r\nby  the  importer,  therefore,  serves  no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose  between  the importer and  the  retailer.\r\n\r\nThis wastage of labour and labelling material will\r\n\r\nagain  lead  to  higher  expenditure  which   will\r\n\r\nfinally be passed on to the end-users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many importers of new drugs and poisons have\r\n\r\nfound   the  approval  procedure  very  arbitrary,\r\n\r\nespecially in border-line cases. There appears  to\r\n\r\nbe  no  co-ordination between relevant departments\r\n\r\nand  frequently  importers  are  pushed  from  one\r\n\r\ndepartment   to  another.  Although  the   Poisons\r\n\r\nauthority   insists  on  the  requirement   of   a\r\n\r\nqualified pharmacist to present the case, far  too\r\n\r\noften  the  authority is simply represented  by  a\r\n\r\nclerical   officer,   who   finally   makes    his\r\n\r\nrecommendation   to   his   qualified    superior.\r\n\r\nOccasionally,  there appears to be a  \"bargain  or\r\n\r\nnegotiation\" taking place during this  discussion.\r\n\r\nThis  unhealthy situation also needs streamlining.\r\n\r\nI   would   like  to  suggest  that  a   permanent\r\n\r\nassessment  committee  be  set  up  consisting  of\r\n\r\nknowledgeable  and  qualified representatives  and\r\n\r\ngiven proper terms of reference and guidelines  to\r\n\r\nwork with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there exists a Poisons Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  (PAC) which seldom sit  and  only  meet\r\n\r\nwhen necessary. Perhaps the PAC should be given  a\r\n\r\n\"shot\" to wake them up. It should be completely re-organised  and re-vitalised with proper  terms  of\r\n\r\noperations  and  guidelines.  One  of   its   more\r\n\r\nimportant functions must be the continuous  review\r\n\r\nof Poisons regulations and to keep up-to-date with\r\n\r\nrecent  information on the availability and danger\r\n\r\nof existing and/or new poisons. At the moment, the\r\n\r\ndecision to ban an existing poison or to add a new\r\n\r\npoison to the Poisons Schedule is based on  an  ad\r\n\r\nhoc   basis.  Frequently,  incomplete  or  partial\r\n\r\ninformation is used in the assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Available published literature shows that for the\r\n\r\nperiod  1960  to  1969, 114  deaths  were  due  to\r\n\r\ncaustic  soda poisoning consisting of 90 per  cent\r\n\r\nsuicides  and 10 per cent domestic accidents.  For\r\n\r\nthe  same  period  the number  of  deaths  due  to\r\n\r\nsalicyclates poisoning was 21 cases consisting  of\r\n\r\n50  per  cent  suicides and 50 per  cent  domestic\r\n\r\naccidents. This 50 per cent of domestic  accidents\r\n\r\nmostly  involved young children. The  majority  of\r\n\r\nthese cases were due to methyl salicyclates, as it\r\n\r\nis  the  common  ingredient used  in  the  popular\r\n\r\nmedicated oils used\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nextensively   in  external  application   by   the\r\n\r\nChinese. Most Chinese families stock a few bottles\r\n\r\nof  these  medicated oils at  home  and  they  are\r\n\r\nsometimes  used as a sort of panacea.  On  certain\r\n\r\noccasions,  such as in the revival of  unconscious\r\n\r\npersons, a small amount is even taken orally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recent available figures for the four years\r\n\r\n1970-73  revealed 10 deaths due  to  caustic  soda\r\n\r\npoisoning,  whereas the number of  deaths  due  to\r\n\r\nmethyl  salicyclates poisoning was about 3\ufffd  times\r\n\r\nmore  (36  cases). This clearly shows that  deaths\r\n\r\neither  suicides  or  domestic  accidents  due  to\r\n\r\nmethyl salicyclates poisoning have now come to the\r\n\r\nforefront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Chemistry Annual Report for\r\n\r\n1972  gave  a figure of 140 tests for salicyclates\r\n\r\ndetected in biological samples. In addition, tests\r\n\r\nfor  salicyclates  were also  conducted  at  other\r\n\r\npublic testing institutions such as the Department\r\n\r\nof   Pathology.   For  1973,  the  Department   of\r\n\r\nPathology   reported  91  tests  for  salicyclates\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by the Hospital Authorities.  From  the\r\n\r\nabove  figures  (both deaths  and  tests),  it  is\r\n\r\nobvious  that  poisoning due to  salicyclates  has\r\n\r\nachieved  wide proportion. Yet the Poison Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  is  still sleeping  and  doing  nothing\r\n\r\nabout  it.  As mentioned earlier, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  has  stringent and complicated  procedures\r\n\r\nfor  the  control of caustic soda but salicyclates\r\n\r\nis  not  even  placed in the Poisons  Schedule.  I\r\n\r\nwould therefore like to suggest that, in the first\r\n\r\ninstance,  salicyclates should be  placed  in  the\r\n\r\nPoisons  Schedule. This will help  to  effectively\r\n\r\ncontrol and prevent domestic accidents and  deaths\r\n\r\nin some cases of small children and young adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest the setting up of a\r\n\r\nPoisons  Information Centre. The list of available\r\n\r\npoisons is expanding rapidly and a store-house  of\r\n\r\nthe latest information on existing and new poisons\r\n\r\nis  most essential. Many professionals such as the\r\n\r\nmedical practitioners, pharmacists, chemists, etc.\r\n\r\nare sometimes caught in a situation where they are\r\n\r\nin  no  position  to recommend a treatment  for  a\r\n\r\nparticular new poison. The availability\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Poisons  Information  Centre  for\r\n\r\nconsultation under such a situation will  be  most\r\n\r\nhelpful.  It  is  not suggested  that  the  Centre\r\n\r\nshould  be  established on the scale as  those  in\r\n\r\nJapan,  Edinburgh or London. For a start, a  small\r\n\r\nInformation Centre is suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to comment on the Misuse of\r\n\r\nDrugs Act, 1973. The Act became operative in  July\r\n\r\n1973  and  contains extensive provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nregulation  and control of dangerous  and  harmful\r\n\r\ndrugs  - referred to as \"controlled drugs\". Nobody\r\n\r\nwill  dispute the need for such stringent control,\r\n\r\nespecially  with the increasing problems  of  drug\r\n\r\npeddling  and  drug addiction facing  our  society\r\n\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support generally the wide provisions in\r\n\r\nthe   Act,   but  it  is  my  opinion   that   the\r\n\r\nimplementation   part  requires  streamlining.   I\r\n\r\nregret to suggest that the enforcing officers  are\r\n\r\nextremely  bureaucratic and  do  not  exhibit  any\r\n\r\nsense of discretion or flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 (1) (d) of the Act empowers the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make regulations \"requiring  medical\r\n\r\npractitioners,  dentists, pharmacists,  veterinary\r\n\r\nsurgeons  and other persons who deal in controlled\r\n\r\ndrugs  as  may  be authorized by regulations  made\r\n\r\nunder  this Act to keep records and make returns\".\r\n\r\nArising   from   this  provision   the   enforcing\r\n\r\nauthority makes rules insisting that all purchase,\r\n\r\nstorage  and  usage of controlled  drugs  must  be\r\n\r\nregistered  in  a specially bound  book  and  that\r\n\r\nentries  must be made daily. To comply  with  this\r\n\r\nregulation, clinics and surgeries have to employ a\r\n\r\nclerk  just  to do the monotonous task of  posting\r\n\r\nthe controlled drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Your time is up.

An\r\n\r\nemergency  unit  at this hospital  would  help  to\r\n\r\nrelieve   strain  at  the  Outram   Road   General\r\n\r\nHospital.  At  present any emergency treatment  in\r\n\r\nthe Sembawang area i5 referred to the Thomson Road\r\n\r\nHospital  unit.  Travelling  that  distance   from\r\n\r\nSembawang  to the Thomson Road Hospital may  quite\r\n\r\noften be a waste of time, for the narrow roads are\r\n\r\nreputed to be crawling with traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand our hospital wards are crowded,\r\n\r\nand  there is usually a long waiting list. Why not\r\n\r\nintroduce  a  `Home Care' service in hospitals  as\r\n\r\nintroduced  in some countries? Patients  who  have\r\n\r\nthe  necessary people to look after  them  in  the\r\n\r\nhome can be discharged from the hospitals early so\r\n\r\nthat  their beds can be occupied by those who  are\r\n\r\nreally serious. A nursing service that can keep an\r\n\r\neye on these discharged patients can be introduced\r\n\r\nto help those who are looking after their patients\r\n\r\nat  home. Valuable time and money can be saved  in\r\n\r\nthis  way. Further, patients have a better  chance\r\n\r\nof  quick recovery when they are being attended to\r\n\r\nby their loved ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently there was an outbreak of typhoid\r\n\r\nfever  in isolated areas.

For the Member's  information,\r\n\r\nthere   is  already  an  emergency  unit  at   the\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital.  It was  opened  in  November\r\n\r\n1971. However, at the beginning it was providing a\r\n\r\nlimited service, i.e, only during office hours. In\r\n\r\nthe middle of last year the hours were extended to\r\n\r\n9 p.m, on weekdays and 5 p.m, on Sundays. But from\r\n\r\nthe  1st of October last year, it operates  a  24-hour  service.  At the same time, a new  emergency\r\n\r\ncomplex,  complete with operating theatres,  X-ray\r\n\r\ndepartment  and  intensive care  area,  was  being\r\n\r\ndeveloped in the Alexandra Hospital. This  complex\r\n\r\nis expected to be comp1eted in May this year. This\r\n\r\nwill  certainly help to relieve the  load  on  the\r\n\r\nOutram Road General Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Sembawang Hospital, an emergency\r\n\r\nunit  is  also being constructed there,  and  this\r\n\r\nwill be completed in the middle of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to `Home Care' service as suggested\r\n\r\nby  the  Member, this is being looked into by  the\r\n\r\ndistrict  nursing service which cares for patients\r\n\r\nwho  are  discharged from hospitals. Similar  care\r\n\r\nfor mothers and new born babies after delivery are\r\n\r\nalso  provided by midwives. T.B., leprosy and V.D.\r\n\r\npatients  are  visited by investigators.  However,\r\n\r\nall  these  services are in the process  of  being\r\n\r\nreorganised. It must, however, be pointed out that\r\n\r\nsuch    services   are   not   economical    since\r\n\r\nconsiderable  manpower has to be expended  on  the\r\n\r\nfield.  Whereas  only four to  six  cases  can  be\r\n\r\nattended to per day by such visits, three or  more\r\n\r\ntimes  the  number  can  be  attended  to  at  our\r\n\r\nMaternal and Child Health Clinics as well  as  the\r\n\r\nschool  clinics  if  the  patients  go  to   these\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to overcrowding of hospital wards, I\r\n\r\nhave  to  inform the Member that now there  is  no\r\n\r\novercrowding particularly after we took  over  the\r\n\r\nAlexandra and Sembawang Hospitals. Together, these\r\n\r\ntwo  hospitals  have an additional 469  beds.  The\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital has at the  moment  405  beds.\r\n\r\nThis   number  will  be  increased  to  430  beds.\r\n\r\nFurthermore  a  small hospital will  be  built  in\r\n\r\nChangi  to  be called the Changi Chalet  Hospital.\r\n\r\nThis  hospital will be equipped for the  treatment\r\n\r\nof  emergency, outpatient, and X-ray services  and\r\n\r\nminor laboratory investigation. It will have about\r\n\r\n36  beds.  It is expected to be completed  by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I have to say with regard to the\r\n\r\nqueries raised by the Member for Anson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the points raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley,  I  am glad, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  you\r\n\r\nruled that this matter should have been brought up\r\n\r\nunder  a separate subhead. The whole tenor of  the\r\n\r\nspeech of the Member suggests that he was confused\r\n\r\nwith regard to the rules pertaining to our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisons  Act.  First, let me refer to  the  sodium\r\n\r\nhydroxide rules under the Poisons Act, 1958. May I\r\n\r\ninform  the Member for River Valley that it  is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  piece of legislation with six  paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIts  purpose  is  to regulate the sale  of  sodium\r\n\r\nhydroxide, commonly known as caustic soda, so that\r\n\r\nit is available only to persons who require it for\r\n\r\ntrade,  business or industrial purposes. This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  necessary to reduce the  incidence  of\r\n\r\npoisoning,  intentional  or  otherwise,  by   this\r\n\r\nchemical  which has caused death and injury  prior\r\n\r\nto  the  introduction of this control.  The  rules\r\n\r\nrequire  that  licensed sellers  may  sell  sodium\r\n\r\nhydroxide  only to persons holding  valid  permits\r\n\r\nissued by the Ministry. Permits are issued free of\r\n\r\ncharge  to persons who have satisfied the Ministry\r\n\r\nthat  sodium  hydroxide  is  necessary  for  their\r\n\r\nindustries.   In   order  not   to   inconvenience\r\n\r\nindustrialists, permits are issued for  quantities\r\n\r\nestimated  for six months' requirements.  Further,\r\n\r\npersons  who  wish  to  buy sodium  hydroxide  for\r\n\r\nresale,  export or for scientific and  educational\r\n\r\npurposes  are  exempted from  applying  for  these\r\n\r\npermits.   The  rest  of  the  rules  consist   of\r\n\r\ninstructions   to  sellers  when  handling   these\r\n\r\npermits  and  are well understood by all  licensed\r\n\r\nsellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the flexibility in labelling\r\n\r\ncontrol which was referred to by the Member, may I\r\n\r\nsay  that poisons are controlled because of  their\r\n\r\ntoxicity and potentially harmful properties and in\r\n\r\norder to prevent accidents arising from their use.\r\n\r\nFor  the safety of workers handling these poisons,\r\n\r\none  basic  requirement  is  that  containers  for\r\n\r\npoisons  should be labelled with the name  of  the\r\n\r\npoison  contained therein and with the  cautionary\r\n\r\nwords  \"POISON - NOT TO BE TAKEN\" in red  ink  and\r\n\r\nany  other specific cautions relevant to the  form\r\n\r\nand danger of the chemical concerned. For example,\r\n\r\nsodium hydroxide is to be labelled \"Poison -  This\r\n\r\nsubstance  is  caustic.\"  And  the  Poisons   rule\r\n\r\nprovides that they be printed in English, Chinese,\r\n\r\nMalay and Tamil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirements of labelling provided in the\r\n\r\nPoisons  rules  and enforced by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  are  minimal  for the  protection  of  all\r\n\r\npersons handling dangerous chemicals in factories,\r\n\r\nlaboratories,  etc. These requirements  are  basic\r\n\r\nand    universal.   Any   relaxation   of    these\r\n\r\nrequirements  would  increase  industrial  hazards\r\n\r\nwhich  I  believe  my  NTUC colleagues  would  not\r\n\r\nsupport  because it would be creating hazards  for\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain relaxations in labelling\r\n\r\nprovided. For instance, all drugs including patent\r\n\r\nmedicine classified as poisons if dispensed  on  a\r\n\r\nprescription  need  not be  so  labelled.  Certain\r\n\r\ngroups of medicine, e.g, insulin and antihistamine\r\n\r\npreparations, may be labelled with only  the  word\r\n\r\n\"POISON\" and in black letters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Poisons Advisory Committee,\r\n\r\nthis  committee advises me on matters with  regard\r\n\r\nto  poisons and drugs. In fact, it is  an  ad  hoc\r\n\r\ncommittee and not a standing committee. I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  it  is fair to say that this committee  has\r\n\r\ngone  to sleep. In fact, it is an ad hoc committee\r\n\r\nand  a  meeting of this committee is  called  when\r\n\r\nthere  is  any matter to be discussed on  and  for\r\n\r\ntheir  advice.  In  fact, this  committee  met  on\r\n\r\nseveral     occasions     and     made     certain\r\n\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to further control to regulate the\r\n\r\nuse  of  drugs, this is covered by two other  Acts\r\n\r\napart  from the Poisons Act, namely, the Medicines\r\n\r\n(Advertisement and Sale) Act passed  in  1968  and\r\n\r\nthe  Misuse of Drugs Act passed in 1973.  However,\r\n\r\nmay  I say that additional controls are also being\r\n\r\nconsidered  and  my Ministry is now  looking  into\r\n\r\nmeasures  for  the registration of  all  medicinal\r\n\r\nproducts   recommended  for  treatment  of   human\r\n\r\nailments.  The quality of control of all  finished\r\n\r\nmedicinal preparations are also being looked into.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is an all-embracing control and very\r\n\r\nmuch has to be done, and a thorough Medicines Bill\r\n\r\nis  now in the process of being drafted. There may\r\n\r\nbe some loopholes here and there with regard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  medicines sold in Chinese medicine shops,  and\r\n\r\nthey  will be taken care of when the new Medicines\r\n\r\nBill   is   passed.  At  the  moment,  this   very\r\n\r\ncomprehensive Bill is being drafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\ncompletely  missed  all the  points  that  I  have\r\n\r\nraised.  I am not quarrelling about the  rules  in\r\n\r\nthe  Poisons  Act.  I am fully aware  of  the  six\r\n\r\nparagraphs  in  the Act. What I am  suggesting  is\r\n\r\nfairly  straightforward. Why is it that a  person,\r\n\r\nwho  holds Form A which allows him to buy  caustic\r\n\r\nsoda  from  anywhere outside Singapore, cannot  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to buy sodium hydroxide within Singapore?\r\n\r\nIn  other words, the law requires that if he holds\r\n\r\nForm   A   under   the  Poisons   Act,   he   must\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  hold  Form  E  under  the   sodium\r\n\r\nhydroxide  rule  1958. Without  this  Form  E,  he\r\n\r\ncannot  buy  caustic soda locally. My question  is\r\n\r\nstraightforward. Why is it that a person,  who  is\r\n\r\nauthorised  by law by holding Form A  to  purchase\r\n\r\ncaustic  soda from anywhere outside Singapore,  is\r\n\r\nnot  allowed to buy caustic soda within  Singapore\r\n\r\nunless  he holds Form E? That is the gist  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst point that I want to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is on the question of labelling.\r\n\r\nI  am not suggesting any leniency or relaxation of\r\n\r\nthe  Poisons  Act or the Poisons  rule.  From  the\r\n\r\npractical  point  of view, I am  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nenforcement  section,  in particular  the  Poisons\r\n\r\nInspectorate, does not exercise any  common  sense\r\n\r\nat  all and no sense of discretion. I went through\r\n\r\nthe trouble to quote the examples. For example, an\r\n\r\nimporter already imports a certain poison with the\r\n\r\nlabel \"POISON\" in English, and what he does is  to\r\n\r\nsell this labelled poison to a trading firm or  to\r\n\r\na  manufacturing firm which intends to repack  and\r\n\r\nsell  it to the pharmacist. Therefore. I am saying\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  no  necessity for  the  importer,\r\n\r\nhaving  bought this carton of poison, to  put  the\r\n\r\nword \"POISON\" on the carton in four languages  and\r\n\r\nsend it to the retailer, because the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretailer  will tear the whole label  out  and  put\r\n\r\nanother  label  \"POISON\" in four languages  inside\r\n\r\nthe carton. I do not see the logic. I am trying to\r\n\r\nexplain that this requirement is unnecessary,  and\r\n\r\nin terms of labour and labelling material the end-user  finally has to pay a higher price for it.  I\r\n\r\nam saying that some discretion be exercised in the\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  this simple  rule.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting any relaxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point, as far as the Poisons Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  is concerned, is precisely  what  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying to get at -that decisions are made on an ad\r\n\r\nhoc  basis.  To ban or to include a  poison  is  a\r\n\r\ndecision  made  on  an ad hoc  basis.  So  I  have\r\n\r\nsuggested  very  clearly that there  should  be  a\r\n\r\npermanent committee. So on these three points, the\r\n\r\nMinister has completely misunderstood me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point that the Minister has not answered\r\n\r\nis my suggestion on the procedure for approval.  I\r\n\r\nmentioned  that there is no co-ordination  between\r\n\r\nrelevant  departments. I have also mentioned  that\r\n\r\non the one hand the Poisons authority requires the\r\n\r\nretailer  or the importer to have a pharmacist  to\r\n\r\npresent  his  case and yet, on the other  hand  at\r\n\r\nGovernment  end it is only a clerk  who  tries  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate.  I am suggesting that a more  permanent\r\n\r\ncommittee  be set up, which the Minister  has  not\r\n\r\neven touched on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which I wanted to say was that I\r\n\r\nwent   through   a   lot  of  trouble   collecting\r\n\r\nstatistics to show why - and I am sorry to say the\r\n\r\nMinister  did  not  quite understand  what  I  was\r\n\r\ntrying  to  get at with all the confusion  of  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of sodium hydroxide -there is a  need  to\r\n\r\nput   methyl   salicyclate   under   the   Poisons\r\n\r\nOrdinance. I illustrated that for the whole period\r\n\r\n1970-73,  there were only 10 deaths  from  caustic\r\n\r\nsoda  poisoning  whereas there were  36  cases  of\r\n\r\nsalicyclate  poisoning. I would  have  thought  it\r\n\r\nobvious  that the Minister would give a reasonable\r\n\r\nreply  and  say,  \"O.K., we will  put  it  in  the\r\n\r\nPoisons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule\",  or \"We will consider it.\"  Instead  he\r\n\r\ncompletely  dismisses all the efforts I  have  put\r\n\r\nin. He did not say anything about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in connection with this lack of co-ordination and also this non-flexibility or\r\n\r\ncomplete  lack of discretion on the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nenforcement section, I am suggesting that although\r\n\r\nlaws   are   passed   by  Parliament   with   good\r\n\r\nintentions, sometimes the spirit and intention are\r\n\r\ncompletely misinterpreted by those responsible for\r\n\r\nits implementation. This is serious because it can\r\n\r\nlead  to  misunderstanding between the  Government\r\n\r\nand the public. This sometimes leads to resentment\r\n\r\nagainst the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up the last point on the non-flexible\r\n\r\nbureaucratic approach. Under the Misuse  of  Drugs\r\n\r\nAct   every  medical  practitioner  or  practising\r\n\r\nsurgeon  must put an entry into a specially  bound\r\n\r\nrecord book whatever he buys, uses and stores. And\r\n\r\nhe  must  employ a clerk to do all this monotonous\r\n\r\nwork.  Because of section 34 (1) (d) of  the  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement section in the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\ninsists  that  it  must also be a specially  bound\r\n\r\nbook  approved by the Ministry of Health officials\r\n\r\nand  that  entries must be made in the book  every\r\n\r\nday.  I  do  not see the logic of it. Consequently\r\n\r\nsome  doctors  have been summoned to  court  on  a\r\n\r\ntechnicality, which defeats the usefulness of this\r\n\r\nMisuse  of  Drugs Act. Perhaps the Minister  could\r\n\r\nplease comment on these few points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in all fairness, let me\r\n\r\nsay  that the Member for River Valley is a  highly\r\n\r\nqualified chemist, whereas the Minister is not. It\r\n\r\ndoes  seem  to me that the Minister has  been  fed\r\n\r\nwith  all  sorts of wrong information, and  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  time  we changed the Chief Chemist  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, if the Member for River\r\n\r\nValley  is less excited about the whole matter,  I\r\n\r\nthink he would have understood some of my answers.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is he gets so excited that he does not\r\n\r\nunderstand me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point he raised about Form A\r\n\r\nand  Form  E, may I say that if anyone  buys  from\r\n\r\noutside, that means he is importing. That is quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from buying within Singapore. He may  be\r\n\r\nan  importer, a small time consumer or a big  time\r\n\r\nconsumer, but if he buys in Singapore, that is not\r\n\r\nimporting. So different rules apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Poisons Advisory Committee\r\n\r\nwhich advises me as Minister, I am not saying that\r\n\r\nwe  will  not  consider his  recommendation  of  a\r\n\r\npermanent committee. I am just pointing out to him\r\n\r\nthat it is not fair to ask an ad hoc committee  to\r\n\r\nmeet regularly. He says this committee has gone to\r\n\r\nsleep. In fairness I must stand up to defend  this\r\n\r\ncommittee. It is an ad hoc committee and  it  only\r\n\r\nmeets  when it is called to meet. So it is  unfair\r\n\r\nto  say  that it has gone to sleep. The suggestion\r\n\r\nof  the  Member for River Valley was that we  must\r\n\r\nform a permanent committee. Well and good, we will\r\n\r\nconsider  his  suggestion. Perhaps  I  might  even\r\n\r\nnominate  him  to  be Chairman of this  committee,\r\n\r\nsince he is so well versed with the small details.\r\n\r\nIf  I  do, then the suggestion made by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu will be met and I will be fed by  a\r\n\r\nwell-qualified chemist on matters of poisons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point complained of by the Member for\r\n\r\nRiver  Valley is that these rules and  regulations\r\n\r\nhave not been implemented in the right spirit, but\r\n\r\ncarried  out to the letter of the law.  There  are\r\n\r\nalways two sides to a question. That was his point\r\n\r\nof  view, whereas the enforcement officer has  his\r\n\r\npoint  of view. The trouble is that while  he  has\r\n\r\nmade   this   allegation,  I  do  not   have   the\r\n\r\nenforcement officer here to confront his  charges.\r\n\r\nBut since I represent them I will do as best as  I\r\n\r\ncan.  Sir,  I do not know of the actual  instances\r\n\r\nwhere he says that they are unimaginative in their\r\n\r\naction.  But to be fair, I always listen  to  both\r\n\r\nsides  of the story and come to my own conclusion,\r\n\r\nnot just one side of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, just a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.

I\r\n\r\nam   suggesting  what  I  think  the  public   are\r\n\r\nthinking, and I am reflecting their views. Perhaps\r\n\r\nto  satisfy  the Minister, what he has  to  do  is\r\n\r\nsimply  to  ask  the  public.  Go  round  to  some\r\n\r\nclinics, surgeries or manufacturing firms and  see\r\n\r\nwhat  they  think of the enforcement officers,  in\r\n\r\nparticular the Poisons Inspectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is unfair for the Minister to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  since I have brought the matter up,  then  I\r\n\r\nhad better do it.

I think this point of logic\r\n\r\nis  very  important  because it  means  either  an\r\n\r\nindustrial firm has to stop production or  not.  I\r\n\r\ngrant that if one is allowed to buy anything  from\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, that means importing.

I am trying  to\r\n\r\ntell  the  Minister that it does not  make  sense.\r\n\r\nMaybe   that   1958   rule   requires   amendment.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it is time the Inspectorate woke up  to\r\n\r\nwhat  other people in the world are doing.

I am alarmed by the degree of discontent\r\n\r\nand low morale among hospital staff. This has been\r\n\r\ncompounded  by  the world-wide inflation  in  1973\r\n\r\nthat   served   only  to  further  aggravate   the\r\n\r\nsituation. To illustrate this, may I quote figures\r\n\r\nof the number of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoctors resigning from the Health Ministry from\r\n\r\n1970 to 1974?\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n                               Resignations\r\n\r\n      1970                          35\r\n\r\n      1971                          44\r\n\r\n      1972                          69\r\n\r\n      1973                          67\r\n\r\n      1974 (January to March only)  53\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>These figures eloquently speak for themselves. For\r\n\r\nthe first three months alone this year, 53 doctors\r\n\r\nhave  resigned. It is conceivable that by the  end\r\n\r\nof this year many more will leave - multiply 53 by\r\n\r\n4,  and  we  will have more than 200 resignations.\r\n\r\nSir,  are  we  to  wait any  longer  to  see  more\r\n\r\nresignations before remedial action  is  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe Health Ministry to keep doctors in service?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what is more disturbing today is not the\r\n\r\nexodus  of doctors from the public to the  private\r\n\r\nsector,  but  the growing number  of  doctors  and\r\n\r\ndental  surgeons  who  have left  or  are  leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  work or emigrate to Australia,  New\r\n\r\nZealand, the United Kingdom, U.S.A, and Canada!  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Hon.  Minister can produce  figures  to\r\n\r\nhighlight this very sad and very regrettable state\r\n\r\nof affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last comprehensive salary review for doctors\r\n\r\nwas  more  than 10 years ago. Unless an  immediate\r\n\r\nreview  of salary and service conditions is  made,\r\n\r\nthe  future of the health service and health  care\r\n\r\nfor our people will hang precariously in jeopardy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is today, the hospitals are grossly\r\n\r\nunderstaffed. Work-load continues to increase. New\r\n\r\nhospitals and new departments are set up and  with\r\n\r\nfewer  doctors the work-load per doctor  naturally\r\n\r\nincreases.  Some departments, I am sure  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  is  aware, are now running with  just  a\r\n\r\nskeleton  staff.  I am sure the Hon.  Minister  is\r\n\r\nalso  aware that departments are running with  one\r\n\r\nsenior  registrar when there should be  four,  and\r\n\r\ntwo  medical officers when there should be  seven,\r\n\r\nand  five  housemen when there should be eight  or\r\n\r\nnine.   What  incentive  is  there  to  keep   the\r\n\r\nremaining doctors from leaving?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, private practice is attractive with every\r\n\r\ngood  prospect of earning multiples of the  salary\r\n\r\nthat  institutional service offers. Most certainly\r\n\r\nit   is  preposterous  to  expect  Government   to\r\n\r\nsubstantially  increase  salaries  to  match   the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  What can be  done  is  to  raise\r\n\r\nsalaries to a more realistic and reasonable  level\r\n\r\nand at the same time to offer fringe benefits such\r\n\r\nas housing. Housing for the middle income group in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  without doubt its biggest  problem.\r\n\r\nThis  problem has been raised in Parliament during\r\n\r\nthis  Budget debate and the Government  has  shown\r\n\r\nfull cognisance of it. The cost of private housing\r\n\r\nhas  soared  way beyond the reach of  doctors  and\r\n\r\nother  middle income wage earners. I am confident,\r\n\r\nSir,  that doctors will stay in service if housing\r\n\r\nbenefit is extended amongst other incentives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Ministry has made desperate attempts\r\n\r\nto  solve the doctor crisis by recruiting  foreign\r\n\r\ndoctors into Singapore. More and more doctors  are\r\n\r\nbeing  recruited from India and Ceylon.  Recently,\r\n\r\ndoctors  from the Philippines, Taiwan,  Korea  and\r\n\r\neven  Indo-China  are recruited  to  prop  up  our\r\n\r\nhospitals.  I  wonder if this move of  the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry is a temporary measure to meet the doctor\r\n\r\nshortage,  or  is  this going to  be  a  permanent\r\n\r\nfeature.  Paradoxically, we in this  country  have\r\n\r\nenough   doctors   of  our  own   to   staff   our\r\n\r\nestablishments. Sir, I do not propose  to  discuss\r\n\r\nthe  merits  or  demerits  of  recruiting  foreign\r\n\r\ndoctors.  What  I  hope  will  not  happen  is   a\r\n\r\nsituation  in  this country like that  in  Britain\r\n\r\ntoday  where its hospitals and allied institutions\r\n\r\nare run by foreigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the need for a review of salary and\r\n\r\nservice  conditions, there is an  urgent  need  to\r\n\r\nattract  and to encourage more students  to  study\r\n\r\nmedicine. This is all the more necessary with  the\r\n\r\nprojected  plans to build new hospitals.  Has  the\r\n\r\nHealth  Ministry made any projection of its  staff\r\n\r\nrequirement  say, in five years' time?  Sir,  this\r\n\r\nmonth,  out  of  26 dental surgeons who  graduated\r\n\r\nfrom  the  University of Singapore, not one  is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof this country. With more than 100 houseman-posts\r\n\r\navailable,  not  more  than  60  Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to graduate as doctors from our  medical\r\n\r\nschool  which proudly boasts to be one of the  top\r\n\r\nmedical institutions in the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to part-time doctors, some 20-30\r\n\r\nper  cent  of doctors are females. It is  a  well-known  fact  that  many  female  doctors  are  not\r\n\r\npractising  their professional expertise  as  they\r\n\r\nare  also  at the same time expected  to  be  good\r\n\r\nhousewives  and  mothers. In view of  the  current\r\n\r\nstaff shortage, would the Hon. Minister reconsider\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  stand not to  accept  these  lady\r\n\r\ndoctors for part-time service? Requests for  part-time  employment  in the Health Ministry  by  lady\r\n\r\ndoctors  have  up  till today been  rejected.  The\r\n\r\nmedical  establishments can  well  do  with  these\r\n\r\nadditional hands. The public spends almost $10,000\r\n\r\na   year  to  train  medical  students  to  become\r\n\r\ndoctors.  Can  the  Ministry  justify  this   huge\r\n\r\nexpenditure if the expertise obtained is to  waste\r\n\r\nbehind kitchen doors?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Kim Seng a lot of  doctors  have\r\n\r\nresigned  since 1970. Could it be  that  there  is\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in their promotions? There are also\r\n\r\nsome specialists who have resigned. How is it that\r\n\r\nforeign  doctors  are promoted whereas  our  local\r\n\r\ndoctors are not promoted? If they are not promoted\r\n\r\nthey  will resign. The Minister must find out  why\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  short of doctors.  Foreign  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom   Australia,  U.K.,  Brunei,  and   Malaysia,\r\n\r\nincluding  India,  can be accepted.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nmust  reconsider this matter and  try  to  recruit\r\n\r\nforeign doctors who are able. It is unfair not  to\r\n\r\naccept foreign doctors. Otherwise next year  there\r\n\r\nwill  be a bigger shortage of doctors. But if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  does  not care about the  shortage,  who\r\n\r\nwill suffer? The people will suffer, and therefore\r\n\r\nhe must take into consideration what I have said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some Members:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson makes one think that only  he\r\n\r\nis  concerned  about the shortage of doctors,  not\r\n\r\nthe  Minister or the Ministry. I think he has made\r\n\r\na very far-fetched statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just deal with the Member for Kim Seng now?\r\n\r\nHe  spoke about the shortage of doctors last  year\r\n\r\nand also about why they should have their salaries\r\n\r\nrevised and so on, and that nothing has been  done\r\n\r\nto date. That is not strictly true because, as far\r\n\r\nas our specialist doctors are concerned, their pay\r\n\r\nhas  been  increased  by the  recent  increase  in\r\n\r\nspecialist  allowances. Further, they can  now  be\r\n\r\npromoted on merit and their promotion will not  be\r\n\r\ndependent upon vacancy in the posts available.  In\r\n\r\nfact, there is no limit to the superscale level to\r\n\r\nwhich they can be promoted. For example, a head of\r\n\r\na  unit  has been promoted to Superscale Grade  D,\r\n\r\nwhereas in the past heads of units were limited to\r\n\r\nSuperscale  Grade  E. That is just  for  a  start.\r\n\r\nThere have been promotion exercises, and it is not\r\n\r\ntrue to say nothing has happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as medical officers are concerned,\r\n\r\nhon.  Members may be aware that the National Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  been  given  the  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nreviewing  salaries not only of doctors  but  also\r\n\r\nothers in the context of the nation as a whole. In\r\n\r\nfact,  to  be  fair,  doctors  are  not  the  only\r\n\r\nprofessionals working in the Government. There are\r\n\r\narchitects, engineers, and so on. So any  increase\r\n\r\nor  revision  in  salaries must also  include  the\r\n\r\ndoctors.  Of  course, as the  Health  Minister,  I\r\n\r\nwould   very  much  urge  that  their  terms   and\r\n\r\nconditions  of service are improved.  But,  before\r\n\r\nthe  National Wages Council deliberates over these\r\n\r\nmatters, the medical officer, in the meantime, has\r\n\r\nbenefited from the 13th month payment - there were\r\n\r\ntwo  13th month payments in one particular year  - and  also  the  9  per  cent  wage  supplement  as\r\n\r\nrecommended by the National Wages Council.  So  it\r\n\r\nis not true to say that nothing has been done with\r\n\r\nregard to their salaries. Something has been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone although perhaps not as much as we wish it to\r\n\r\nbe.  But  it  is rather odd - and I am not  saying\r\n\r\nanything  in objection - that salaries of  doctors\r\n\r\nhave  been  raised again and again in this  august\r\n\r\nAssembly,  but  so far I have not  heard  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  of  any raise in salaries of accountants,\r\n\r\nengineers   and   architects   employed   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the resignation of doctors.\r\n\r\nLet  me  hasten  to  assure the public  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  alarmed.  Although  the  rate  of\r\n\r\nresignation has increased, I do not think the  way\r\n\r\nin which the Member for Kim Seng has presented the\r\n\r\ncase  is correct, that is, just because there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a large number of resignations in the  first\r\n\r\nfew months of this year, resignations will come up\r\n\r\nto a very high figure by the end of the year. I do\r\n\r\nnot think that will happen. I would like to assure\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  that  although  we   are\r\n\r\nunderstaffed at the moment we are not  badly  off.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some years ago doctors had to work longer\r\n\r\nhours.   At  the  moment,  although  not  in   all\r\n\r\nhospitals  but  in  quite a number  of  hospitals,\r\n\r\ndoctors have been given a day off following  night\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the figures about the resignation\r\n\r\nof  doctors in 1970, which the Member for Kim Seng\r\n\r\nquoted, they are more or less correct. They  tally\r\n\r\nwith my figures although there may be a difference\r\n\r\nof  one  or  two. Then he did ask me how  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  doctors had emigrated to Canada,  Australia\r\n\r\nand  so on. I do not have the actual figures,  but\r\n\r\nthe figures which I have on migration are obtained\r\n\r\nfrom  various  sources,  that  is,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical   Association,  medical  colleagues,   the\r\n\r\nMedical  Register and so on. I  can  say  that  in\r\n\r\n1973,  out  of the 67 resignations, four  went  to\r\n\r\nAustralia,  one to Brunei, one to Canada,  one  to\r\n\r\nIndia, one to New Zealand, one to Sibu, two to the\r\n\r\nU.K, and  10 joined the University of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAnd  41  of  them actually resigned  for  personal\r\n\r\nreasons, which means that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey are probably in private practice earning,  as\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kim Seng has said, three  or  four\r\n\r\ntimes  more. If they want to earn much more  money\r\n\r\nin private practice, we cannot help it. But we try\r\n\r\nour  best to retain them. In fact, as far  as  the\r\n\r\nmovement  of  doctors from Government  service  to\r\n\r\nprivate  practice is concerned, as  Members  would\r\n\r\nknow,  we have introduced two schemes to get  them\r\n\r\nback  to work for at least a few sessions  in  our\r\n\r\nhospitals.   First,   there   is   the   part-time\r\n\r\nconsultant   scheme  whereby  those   in   private\r\n\r\npractice  who  volunteer to work in  the  hospital\r\n\r\nwill  be  paid  a  certain sum per  session.  This\r\n\r\nscheme   is   particularly   helpful   to    those\r\n\r\ndepartments which need the specialists  concerned.\r\n\r\nThe other scheme, of course, is the appointment of\r\n\r\nhonorary consultants so that their expertise  will\r\n\r\nnot  be lost in the private sector. In fact,  they\r\n\r\nwill see more searching cases in the hospitals and\r\n\r\ntheir talents will be more usefully employed there\r\n\r\nthan in the private sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the point about foreign doctors having\r\n\r\nbeen  recruited into the Singapore health service,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say  this? As far as Government policy  is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  do  not go out  of  our  way,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  to  advertise in the  press  to  recruit\r\n\r\ndoctors  from  other countries. Any applicant  who\r\n\r\nwrites in and is found suitable for recruitment is\r\n\r\noffered employment. Recruitment of foreign doctors\r\n\r\ninto  the service is in the main confined to those\r\n\r\nwith  higher  qualifications. With regard  to  the\r\n\r\nbreakdown of figures of foreign doctors  which  we\r\n\r\nhave  employed, may I say that the  largest  group\r\n\r\nconsists  of Malaysians. We have in service  today 43  Malaysian doctors, 16 of whom are with  higher\r\n\r\nqualifications     and    27    without     higher\r\n\r\nqualifications. The second group  consists  of  13\r\n\r\nCeylonese,   11   of   whom   have   got    higher\r\n\r\nqualifications,   in   other   words,   they   are\r\n\r\nspecialists.  Only two of them are without  higher\r\n\r\nqualifications.  We have also six Indian  doctors,\r\n\r\ntwo with higher qualifications and four without\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhigher  qualifications. And there are  14  others,\r\n\r\nfive  with higher qualifications and nine  without\r\n\r\nhigher  qualifications. Altogether the  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  doctors is 76. As far as  our  policy  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, as I have said, we do not go out of our\r\n\r\nway  to recruit foreign doctors. If they apply and\r\n\r\nif  they  are  found suitable, we employ  them  if\r\n\r\nthere  are vacancies. We cannot be too choosey  in\r\n\r\nour recruitment. If we have vacancies we fill them\r\n\r\nup.  Of course, we are very concerned about  their\r\n\r\ncompetence and standards. In fact, as I have said,\r\n\r\nmost  of them have higher qualifications. For  the\r\n\r\ninformation of Members, the vast majority  of  the\r\n\r\nIndian  and  Ceylonese doctors we  have  recruited\r\n\r\nhave recognised higher medical qualifications from\r\n\r\nthe U.K. Their qualifications include the M.R.C.P.\r\n\r\nLondon,  or  Edinburgh, or  F.R.C.S,.  London,  or\r\n\r\nEdinburgh.   Most  of  them  had   hitherto   held\r\n\r\nspecialist  positions in the  U.K, hospitals.  On\r\n\r\nrecruitment  into our service they were  appointed\r\n\r\ndirectly  to consultant positions, as for example,\r\n\r\nSenior  Registrars. Thus with regard to the policy\r\n\r\nof  appointing doctors from overseas which I  have\r\n\r\nenumerated,   the   possibility   of    recruiting\r\n\r\nincompetent doctors is very much reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of them have performed\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily. However, in any group there  would\r\n\r\nbe  a  few who might not perform as satisfactorily\r\n\r\nas we would have wished. In this respect there has\r\n\r\nbeen  only one case in which it has been necessary\r\n\r\nto  terminate  the contract of a  foreign  doctor.\r\n\r\nThis was not for lack of competence but because he\r\n\r\ndid not fit well into the service. However, if any\r\n\r\none  of  them is found to be incompetent.  We  can\r\n\r\neasily terminate his contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the intake of medical and dental\r\n\r\nstudents  into  our  medical  schools,   I   agree\r\n\r\nentirely  that we should do our very best  to  get\r\n\r\nour  citizens  to take up medicine and  dentistry.\r\n\r\nBut,  unfortunately, it appears  that  with  rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  going on in Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nshortage of engineers, architects and accountants,\r\n\r\nmany  of  our young men now tend to opt  for  such\r\n\r\ncourses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  overlook medicine and dentistry. This is  the\r\n\r\nsituation we are now facing. But, in any case,  we\r\n\r\nwill  give  them every encouragement  to  take  up\r\n\r\nmedicine,  not  only for an under-graduate  course\r\n\r\nbut also a post-graduate course for those who have\r\n\r\nalready qualified. In fact, we have devised a very\r\n\r\nattractive  training scheme for young  doctors  to\r\n\r\ntake  up  a  higher qualification. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthere  is much complaint as far as that scheme  is\r\n\r\nconcerned.  Many doctors have taken  advantage  of\r\n\r\nthat  scheme and, as a result, we produce quite  a\r\n\r\nlarge number of Masters of Medicine in the various\r\n\r\nspecialities each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to projections for staff\r\n\r\nrequirements, may I say that there  are  not  only\r\n\r\nnew  projections  but also new services  as  well.\r\n\r\nThis is based on the criteria determined by actual\r\n\r\nobservation  in  the  ward. For  example,  in  the\r\n\r\nmedical unit, for every 70 beds there should be  a\r\n\r\nstaff  complement comprising one  consultant,  two\r\n\r\nsenior  registrars,  three  medical  officers  and\r\n\r\nthree  to  four housemen. The figures are  higher,\r\n\r\nfor  instance,  in  the surgical,  obstetrics  and\r\n\r\ngynaecology  wards. Of course, this is  the  ideal\r\n\r\nnumber. We try to project the Ideal, but if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have the ideal number we try to make do  with\r\n\r\nwhat we have.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to incentives to retain doctors in\r\n\r\nthe  service,  particularly young  doctors,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the  scheme for Government  officers  to  be\r\n\r\neligible  for  housing, we  are  also  considering\r\n\r\nbuilding some blocks of flats for medical officers\r\n\r\nas  part  of  the development of the new  hospital\r\n\r\nthat  is coming up in Outram Road. I am personally\r\n\r\nvery  sympathetic  to  the  need  of  doctors  for\r\n\r\nhouses, especially the young doctors, who have not\r\n\r\nestablished  their  own  homes.  My  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nrecently  appointed  a  committee  to  study  this\r\n\r\nquestion  and to make recommendations.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  if  our young doctors are given houses  they\r\n\r\nwill  not  only be tied down to their service  but\r\n\r\nthey  will  also have something to  lose  if  they\r\n\r\nthink of emigrating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the Member for Anson, I might\r\n\r\nas  well  enlighten the Member for Kim Seng  about\r\n\r\nemploying lady doctors part-time. I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay  straightaway that we have  a  scheme  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment to employ lady doctors part-time. It is not\r\n\r\nthat  we  have no such scheme. In fact, there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  schemes  whereby doctors in private  practice\r\n\r\ncan be appointed to the medical service. The first\r\n\r\nScheme  A is based on sessional appointment  where\r\n\r\nwe  pay $30 for a two-hour session up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof  $400  a month. The second Scheme B is a  part-time  appointment paid in proportion to the  hours\r\n\r\nof  work given each week to a 42 hourly times  the\r\n\r\nlast drawn salary. Such appointments would be  for\r\n\r\nthose  who were previously in Government  service.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, in respect of Scheme A we have four\r\n\r\nappointments.  For the information of  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kim Seng, three of them are married women and\r\n\r\nI  think  one  is  a male doctor. With  regard  to\r\n\r\nScheme   B,  two  lady  doctors  have  also   been\r\n\r\nappointed. In other words, they are being utilised\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of the medical service. It is not\r\n\r\ntrue  to  say  that  their  applications  are  not\r\n\r\nconsidered at all. We will be happy to take  in  a\r\n\r\nlarger  number  under  this  scheme.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Kim Seng can encourage  some  of  his\r\n\r\ncolleagues to apply for these appointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless I have left out anything else that the\r\n\r\nMember for Kim Seng has raised, may I just  go  on\r\n\r\nto  the Member for Anson. The Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nagain  brought  up  the  question  of  the  recent\r\n\r\namendment to the Medical Registration Act  whereby\r\n\r\nwe have in our local List excluded medical schools\r\n\r\nin  India.  This  does  not mean  that  those  who\r\n\r\ngraduated  from medical schools in India  are  not\r\n\r\nable  to  practise in Singapore. Under  a  certain\r\n\r\nprovision  of the Act, they can apply to practise.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  Medical Council will  judge  their\r\n\r\ncompetence  by invariably setting an  examination,\r\n\r\nand  on  passing  the examination,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nregistered. I have already answered this question\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen  the  Member for Anson raised it at the  last\r\n\r\nBudget debate. Of course, the Member may have  his\r\n\r\nown  views. But that is the position. It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  that we guard our standards of  medical\r\n\r\npractice very jealously. Other countries may  have\r\n\r\nother  standards, but that is their privilege.  As\r\n\r\nfar  as  Singapore is concerned,  human  life  and\r\n\r\nhealth  is  important and we want to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nonly  competent  doctors are allowed  to  practise\r\n\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the Government has again\r\n\r\nbrought  out  the  bogey  of  the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil. It is not true that the doctors have  not\r\n\r\ngot  wage increments, wage adjustments and so  on.\r\n\r\nThey  do receive the 9 per cent and the 13th month\r\n\r\npay  and  so on. Sir, everybody receives  the  NWC\r\n\r\naward,  not  just the doctors and architects.  NWC\r\n\r\nrecommendations  are the result  of  a  number  of\r\n\r\nfactors  -  to  make  adjustments  for  the   wage\r\n\r\nrestraints  and  for the cost of living  that  has\r\n\r\nincreased tremendously. Perhaps this may not be  a\r\n\r\npermanent feature. But to say that doctors did get\r\n\r\nwage  increases  is not correct. It  is  something\r\n\r\nthat 1 find hard to accept. The Minister said that\r\n\r\ndoctors  are  not  the only  people  who  did  not\r\n\r\nreceive   the  wage  increase,  but  others   too,\r\n\r\narchitects,  accountants, lawyers. But  the  brain\r\n\r\ndrain  in  the  medical services has been  greater\r\n\r\nthan in any other service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Does the Member have the facts\r\n\r\nand figures?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N.

I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwould  be able to tell me that the brain drain  in\r\n\r\nthe medical services is not greater than the brain\r\n\r\ndrain  in  all the other services and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nwhy  should there be wage adjustments for doctors.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  for me to produce facts and  figures.\r\n\r\nHowever,  Sir,  we  have examples.  Where  we  are\r\n\r\nafraid  that  there will be further  resignations,\r\n\r\nwage  adjustments have been made in the Government\r\n\r\nservice,  e.g, the Police and the Fire Brigade  in\r\n\r\nspite of the National Wages Council awards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we  should look into the  question  of\r\n\r\nresignation  of  doctors much more carefully  than\r\n\r\njust  writing it off as \"What to do? We cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of housing for doctors brought\r\n\r\nup  by  the  Member for Kim Seng is worth  looking\r\n\r\ninto.  I  am glad the Minister has mentioned  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is looking into the possibility  of\r\n\r\nproviding doctors with houses. This is a  move  in\r\n\r\nthe  right direction. I know of a doctor who asked\r\n\r\nhis  wife to resign so that they could qualify  to\r\n\r\napply  a  Housing Board flat, as he was bonded  to\r\n\r\nserve the Government. I think he had a scholarship\r\n\r\nand, therefore, he had to serve for five years. If\r\n\r\nhe  did not have such a bond with the Ministry, he\r\n\r\nwould  have  resigned from the service instead  of\r\n\r\nasking  his wife to resign. This is a matter  that\r\n\r\nwe have to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the very fact that less people want to take\r\n\r\nup  medicine is a sure sign that there is no money\r\n\r\nin medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> No money in medicine in\r\n\r\nGovernment service - if the Minister wants  me  to\r\n\r\nbe  specific. I think I heard - I hope I am  wrong\r\n\r\n-the Minister saying that private doctors who come\r\n\r\nto serve the Government are being paid $30 for two\r\n\r\nhours. Sir, we get what we deserve. If we pay  for\r\n\r\nquacks,  we  get  quacks. Look at the  newspapers.\r\n\r\nEven  unqualified  private  tutors  for  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  students command much more  than  $15  per\r\n\r\nhour, Sir!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I would like to ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether   he  is  prepared  to  consider  allowing\r\n\r\nChinese  physicians to serve  our  people  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I brought this subject up\r\n\r\nbecause he happened to be the Minister for Health.\r\n\r\nIf  he  were the Minister in charge of architects,\r\n\r\nengineers or lawyers, I would have brought up  the\r\n\r\nsame topic under the pertinent Head. I raised this\r\n\r\npoint because I feel that there is a real case for\r\n\r\nus  to  give careful and thoughtful consideration.\r\n\r\nAnd  I thought that it would be helpful to him  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health. It was not my  intention\r\n\r\nto  be  an  alarmist. I have quoted  figures.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  has very cleverly reduced these  figures\r\n\r\nand felt somehow that one should not be alarmed. I\r\n\r\nhope he is proven right. He has raised a number of\r\n\r\npoints and it is a pity that I do not have time to\r\n\r\nreply to them. I thank the Minister for mentioning\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's care and concern about housing and\r\n\r\nhis  assurance that he will look into this problem\r\n\r\nfurther. The second point is that he would proceed\r\n\r\nto encourage more students, and in the coming year\r\n\r\nI shall be watching it very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for incentive programmes and traineeship\r\n\r\nprogrammes to keep doctors in service,  I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndisagree  with him. In actual fact,  a  number  of\r\n\r\ndoctors who have elected for higher training  have\r\n\r\nresigned  and have refunded to the Health Ministry\r\n\r\nwhatever  amount  they were  given  initially  for\r\n\r\nfurther training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> How many?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> Sir, I do not wish to quote\r\n\r\ncases.  But if the Minister wants, I can give  him\r\n\r\ncases. There was one classic case of a trainee who\r\n\r\nwent on leave for one week. On Monday, the Head of\r\n\r\nDepartment  received a letter of  resignation  but\r\n\r\ntwo  days  before  that he had  already  left  for\r\n\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for part-time lady doctors, I am thankful to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for mentioning that there are cases.\r\n\r\nBut it is surprising that this is somewhat unknown\r\n\r\nor mysteriously hidden. There are in actual fact a\r\n\r\ngood  number of doctors who have applied but  have\r\n\r\nbeen rejected. With the Minister's assurance, I am\r\n\r\nsure  more  doctors  will apply  for  this  scheme\r\n\r\nbecause in all sincerity I hope we attract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nback into the service more people, whether they be\r\n\r\nladies  or men, because we need them just  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said quite clearly earlier  on.

Of course, I quite understand\r\n\r\nhim.  He is a trade unionist. The point is: I  did\r\n\r\nnot say that medical officers should not have wage\r\n\r\nrevisions. I said that it should be revised in the\r\n\r\nnational  context, not only for  medical  officers\r\n\r\nbut  also  the other officers.

I  have  received\r\n\r\ncomplaints that there are times when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of the doctors and nurses attending to cases\r\n\r\nbrought in to this Unit have been found to be rude\r\n\r\nand snobbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctors attached to this Unit must do their\r\n\r\nwork  only at this Unit but instead they are  made\r\n\r\nto  go  on  ward duty as well. As such,  when  the\r\n\r\ndoctor goes round checking the patients, sometimes\r\n\r\nwith  housemen following him around  for  lessons,\r\n\r\nthere  is no other doctor available at this  Unit.\r\n\r\nThe  Emergency Unit is meant for emergency  cases.\r\n\r\nThose  who  are  suffering in  pain  or  requiring\r\n\r\nurgent treatment cannot wait for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the case of a person who was brought in\r\n\r\nbecause of a heart attack. He was attended to only\r\n\r\ntwo  hours  later. By that time he was  only  good\r\n\r\nenough to be pronounced dead. A life was lost  and\r\n\r\nit  could have been saved only if proper attention\r\n\r\nwas  given  at  the right time. I also  understand\r\n\r\nthat often when patients are referred to the X-ray\r\n\r\nunit  by the Emergency Unit, they are not attended\r\n\r\nto as quickly as possible. This has resulted in an\r\n\r\nordinary  X-ray taking about two to  three  hours.\r\n\r\nSometimes the doctors are overworked and  some  of\r\n\r\nthe cases are not thoroughly checked. To quote  an\r\n\r\nexample,  there  was a case of a  statutory  board\r\n\r\nemployee  who fractured his leg in an accident  at\r\n\r\nhis  place of work. He was referred to the  Outram\r\n\r\nRoad  General  Hospital,  and  was  granted  three\r\n\r\nmonths'  leave, but he is still not  fully  cured.\r\n\r\nThough  the nature of his illness does not  permit\r\n\r\nhim  to  do normal duties, the doctor nevertheless\r\n\r\nsent  him to work without recommending that he  be\r\n\r\ngiven light duties because of his limping leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, since the doctor at the General\r\n\r\nHospital  had taken such a decision,  the  Board's\r\n\r\ndoctor  did  not want to overrule the decision  of\r\n\r\nthe   hospital  doctor.  I  think  they  have   an\r\n\r\nagreement  between them. The patient  then  got  a\r\n\r\nnote  from  his  union leader to appeal.  But  the\r\n\r\nletter  was ignored. Furthermore, I understand  he\r\n\r\nwas advised by his\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuperior to take vacation leave instead. I do  not\r\n\r\nblame  the  doctor for this decision; probably  he\r\n\r\ncould  have made a wrong decision due to  pressure\r\n\r\nof  work. We take pride in our hospitals and their\r\n\r\nfacilities,  yet  there  are  many  services  left\r\n\r\nwanting. Some buttons in the medical service  have\r\n\r\nto be pushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Paediatric Unit too at the hospital is often\r\n\r\noverworked. It is believed that there are  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  paediatricians  with many  children  to  look\r\n\r\nafter. If more paediatricians are appointed,  then\r\n\r\nour  children  in  the  ward and  those  requiring\r\n\r\nspecialist   attention  will  not  be   neglected.\r\n\r\nSometimes  patients are turned away  just  because\r\n\r\nthe  doctors  in  the  section  had  gone  to  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  to give lectures to the students.  Why\r\n\r\nis this section understaffed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also note that in this unit there is no\r\n\r\nskin  specialist available. The children are  also\r\n\r\nnot referred to the skin clinic for treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, improvements are needed in the non-paying wards. There is often congestion in these\r\n\r\nwards. Beds are placed all over the corridors  and\r\n\r\nthey  are  so  close to each other that  there  is\r\n\r\nhardly  any  space  for  free  movement.  This  is\r\n\r\naggravated  when student nurses and  housemen  are\r\n\r\nmoving around during their lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, something is definitely wrong with the\r\n\r\nbilling  system  in  the  General  Hospital.  When\r\n\r\npatients leave the hospital after treatment,  part\r\n\r\nof the Bill is sent to the employer and part of it\r\n\r\nto  the  ex-patient. This brings confusion to  the\r\n\r\nemployer  and  the  ex-patient.  I  am  sure   the\r\n\r\naccounting  system in the General Hospital  is  no\r\n\r\nbetter   either.  Why  not  eliminate   all   this\r\n\r\nunnecessary  paper work by sending the  full  bill\r\n\r\ndirectly  to  the  employer or the  ex-patient?  A\r\n\r\ndivision of a single bill will thus be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bring this subject up because there n a case of\r\n\r\nan  employee of a statutory board who was admitted\r\n\r\nto  the  hospital some time back and he was  faced\r\n\r\nwith this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson, I would like to enlighten him by saying\r\n\r\nthat it is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrue  that doctors in the Emergency Unit  do  ward\r\n\r\nduties.  For his information, there are 18 doctors\r\n\r\nattached to the Emergency Unit of the Outram  Road\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital on full-time, and they do not  do\r\n\r\nward  duties at all. Up to March, 1972, there were\r\n\r\nonly  12  doctors attached to the Emergency  Unit.\r\n\r\nThis  number  was increased to 18 in April,  1972.\r\n\r\nThe  Head  of  the  Unit is a surgeon,  and  these\r\n\r\ndoctors are also not on 24-hour call-duty but on a\r\n\r\nshift  duty of eight hours each. The Head  of  the\r\n\r\nUnit is a surgeon and he operates on cold cases as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Anson that emergency\r\n\r\ncases  are always promptly attended to by doctors.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  problem here is that  non-emergency\r\n\r\ncases  come in to crowd the Emergency Unit,  which\r\n\r\nis  meant for emergency cases. As a result,  there\r\n\r\ncould  be occasions when a genuine emergency  case\r\n\r\nescaped notice and was not given proper attention.\r\n\r\nThe Member has quoted some particular cases. If he\r\n\r\nwants me to look into them, he should write to  me\r\n\r\nand  give  me the details. We will certainly  give\r\n\r\nhim satisfaction. He is in the habit of writing to\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry  and myself, and I hope he  continues\r\n\r\nwith that habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to paediatricians, I would like to\r\n\r\nassure him that there is no shortage of specialist\r\n\r\npaediatricians.  In  fact, there  are  12  trained\r\n\r\npaediatricians with higher qualifications  working\r\n\r\nin  the children's ward in the Outram Road General\r\n\r\nHospital.  In  the  past year  more  doctors  have\r\n\r\nacquired  a  higher qualification in  paediatrics.\r\n\r\nHowever, no skin specialists are available in such\r\n\r\nwards.  Skin  specialists are available  in  units\r\n\r\nspecialising  in  this field, and  references  are\r\n\r\nmade to such specialists, if necessary. It is  not\r\n\r\npossible to have all sorts of specialists  in  one\r\n\r\nward.  In  so  far as congestion in  the  ward  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, it is hoped to alleviate this situation\r\n\r\nwhen  the  new  Outram  Road General  Hospital  is\r\n\r\ncompleted, when we will then have more beds in the\r\n\r\nPaediatric Unit. Of course, the problem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  that we will have more and more children,  and\r\n\r\nthat is why family planning has to be stressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to non-paying\r\n\r\nwards  in  the Paediatric Unit in the Outram  Road\r\n\r\nGeneral Hospital. By this, I suppose he refers  to\r\n\r\nC  class wards, and his implication is that  there\r\n\r\nis  no  crowding  in the A and B class  wards.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  the Outram Road General Hospital  there\r\n\r\nare no A and B class wards for children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to patients being turned away because\r\n\r\ndoctors  have  gone  to  the  University  to  give\r\n\r\nlectures  to  medical students,  may  I  say  that\r\n\r\npatients,  whether  they are attended  to  by  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  doctors  or  Government  doctors,  are\r\n\r\nusually requested to come on the appointed day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to bills, they are never sent\r\n\r\npartially to the patient and the employer. As  far\r\n\r\nas  the Ministry of Health is concerned, bills are\r\n\r\nsent to either the patient or the employer. A bill\r\n\r\nis sent to the employer if the employer is willing\r\n\r\nto  furnish a letter of guarantee. However, if  an\r\n\r\nemployer  is  not willing to furnish a  letter  of\r\n\r\nguarantee, the bill is always sent to the patient.\r\n\r\nIn  industrial  cases  where  it  is  possible  to\r\n\r\nidentify the employer, the bill is always sent  to\r\n\r\nhim.  However, in a manually operated system which\r\n\r\nhas to cater for anything up to 180 bills per day,\r\n\r\nminor  errors are bound to occur. However, Members\r\n\r\nmay   wish   to  know  that  the  feasibility   of\r\n\r\ncomputerising the billing system is  under  active\r\n\r\nstudy, and we hope to implement it before long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, in view of the somewhat\r\n\r\nhigh  rate  of  turnover of medical staff  at  the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  I  presume  we have  to  depend  quite\r\n\r\nheavily on newly qualified doctors and housemen. I\r\n\r\nam  just  wondering whether the Minister can  off-hand tell the House what is the average length  of\r\n\r\nmedical experience of doctors in the hospitals. He\r\n\r\nhas many times emphasised on the competence of the\r\n\r\nmedical  staff, and I am just wondering what  sort\r\n\r\nof arrangements are in force to supervise the work\r\n\r\nof these young doctors or housemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, young doctors are always\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  the  consultants  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nsupervision  is adequate. So I do  not  think  the\r\n\r\nMember for Jalan Kayu should worry very much  over\r\n\r\nthis point. In fact, with the recent increment  in\r\n\r\nspecialist  allowances,  there  have   been   less\r\n\r\nresignations from among our Government specialists\r\n\r\nthan from among our medical officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, I was a bit disturbed when\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson alleged that a patient  was\r\n\r\nnot  attended to in time. There was some delay.  I\r\n\r\njust want to know whether or not the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  has  received any such complaint.  Was  he\r\n\r\naware  of this case or did he come to know  of  it\r\n\r\nonly just now when the Member for Anson brought it\r\n\r\nup?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I myself was very disturbed\r\n\r\nwhen  I heard that.

He should have brought it\r\n\r\nup to me in a letter, which lie normally does. The\r\n\r\npoint is this, and I have said just now, we try to\r\n\r\ngive prompt attention to emergency cases, but  the\r\n\r\ntrouble is that the non-emergency cases crowd into\r\n\r\nthe Emergency Unit. As a result, genuine emergency\r\n\r\ncases may have inadvertently escaped attention. In\r\n\r\nfact,  the  doctors and nurses now and  then  pick\r\n\r\ncases which need urgent attention and they do give\r\n\r\nprompt  attention straightaway. The  non-emergency\r\n\r\ncases, of course, have to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Recently, a security corps was  formed  by\r\n\r\nthe  national  servicemen  to  play  the  role  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining law and order. It goes without  saying\r\n\r\nthat the setting up of this corps is a right move.\r\n\r\nOn  the one hand, it helps the Police to keep  law\r\n\r\nand  order. On the other hand, it helps to  enrich\r\n\r\nthe  experience of the Vigilante Corps members and\r\n\r\nto train them to be more competent in their role.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the organisation of this Vigilante Corps\r\n\r\nis  not  big  enough.  There are  only  about  100\r\n\r\nmembers  doing patrol duty. It is not  sufficient.\r\n\r\nMore members should be deployed in the rural areas\r\n\r\nand  the housing estates. That is why I would like\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider increasing the  strength\r\n\r\nof   this   corps.  I  understand  that   national\r\n\r\nservicemen  in the Vigilante Corps number  20,000.\r\n\r\nSir,  it is not difficult to recruit more national\r\n\r\nservicemen  of the Vigilante Corps  to  do  patrol\r\n\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allowance paid to members of\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante  Corps, I think the amount  is  too\r\n\r\nsmall. Members of this corps receive only about 25\r\n\r\ncents  per  hour for their training.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nsmall; 25 cents is not enough to pay for their bus\r\n\r\nfares.  Sir, I would like the Minister to increase\r\n\r\nthe allowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the allowance to the group leader\r\n\r\nof  the Vigilante Volunteer Corps, I would like to\r\n\r\ncite one example. In my constituency there are two\r\n\r\ngroup  leaders. They are very dedicated  to  their\r\n\r\nduties  as  they utilise their leisure  hours  for\r\n\r\nthis  civic role. They have done so for more  than\r\n\r\n10  years. At present, they are in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nvolunteer   corps   in   several   constituencies.\r\n\r\nHowever,  for carrying out their duties, they  are\r\n\r\npaid  only  80 cents per hour for their transport.\r\n\r\nThis  is not enough. The price of petrol has  gone\r\n\r\nup.  The  price  of premium petrol  is  now  about\r\n\r\n$3.20,  an increase of about 50 per cent over  the\r\n\r\npast  year.  Sir,  I would like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider increasing the transport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallowance for the group leaders in order to offset\r\n\r\ntheir loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with regard to the\r\n\r\nrecruitment of volunteers for the Vigilante Corps,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of volunteers is only about  300-400.\r\n\r\nSir,  there has been a reduction in the  programme\r\n\r\nof   activities.  In  order  to  revive  the  full\r\n\r\nprogramme of activities, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  consider  recruiting more members.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  are many dedicated citizens who would  like\r\n\r\nto  participate in such activities, and this is  a\r\n\r\nuseful means to train up our citizens to serve the\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have received some\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from Vigilante Corps members  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  allocation  of duties they  are  deployed  to\r\n\r\nother constituencies. This is not good because  it\r\n\r\nwill  increase their transport expenses and  their\r\n\r\nduties  will  be made more difficult because  they\r\n\r\nare  not  familiar with the environment  in  other\r\n\r\nconstituencies.  In  posting these  members,  they\r\n\r\nshould  be  posted  to constituencies  near  their\r\n\r\nhomes so that they can more effectively carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to talk about long hair. I\r\n\r\nappreciate  the efforts made by the Government  to\r\n\r\nget rid of long hair. There is an Action Committee\r\n\r\nconcerned   with  this  anti-long  hair  movement.\r\n\r\nAlthough  two years have passed, we can still  see\r\n\r\nmany  people  with  long  hair.  Even  in  certain\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments, there are civil  servants\r\n\r\nwith  long  hair. Why is this so? I  believe  that\r\n\r\napart from a minority of people with long hair who\r\n\r\ncome  from  abroad, cinema shows  also  have  some\r\n\r\ninfluence   on  our  young  people   because   the\r\n\r\ncharacters in films also sport long hair.  If  the\r\n\r\nheroes  in  these films keep long hair, our  young\r\n\r\nare  apt to copy them. They believe that in  order\r\n\r\nto  become heroes, they must imitate or copy their\r\n\r\nhair styles. Sir, in order to get rid of long hair\r\n\r\nstyles  vigilance  should be kept  up  and  action\r\n\r\ntaken  to  deal with those who keep long hair.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, we should also ban  those  films\r\n\r\nshowing long-haired heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, lastly, I would like to\r\n\r\ntalk about internal security and what the Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  do. There should be more Police  Weeks  to\r\n\r\npromote  better relations between the  Police  and\r\n\r\nthe  public in order to achieve greater peace  and\r\n\r\norder in the Republic. We should bear in mind that\r\n\r\nco-operation with the Police is part of  our  duty\r\n\r\nas citizens. If better relations exist between the\r\n\r\nPolice   and  the  public,  there  will  be   less\r\n\r\nopportunity for people to commit crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto seek clarification on procedure.

Then  he\r\n\r\nproceeds to talk about the Police which should  be\r\n\r\nraised  under Head ND -Police. Sir,  if  we  allow\r\n\r\nthis  to go on, there is not going to be any order\r\n\r\naround.  Then how are we going to debate? I  would\r\n\r\nlike a ruling on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hwang, I am aware of that. In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  consulted the Clerk on this,  but  since\r\n\r\nthere is no objection either from the Minister  or\r\n\r\nfrom  hon. Members, I have allowed the Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  to  go on. So the next time  you  think\r\n\r\nthat  the  Member  is violating  Standing  Orders,\r\n\r\ncould  you  please object, so as  to  give  me  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to make a ruling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> In that case, can I be\r\n\r\npermitted  to speak now on Police brutality?

I am going to  speak\r\n\r\non  brutality  which is more a subject  of  policy\r\n\r\nthan  the  question of Police Week,  which  is  an\r\n\r\nadministrative matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If it is a question of policy, Mr\r\n\r\nHwang,  you can go ahead. But I will stop  you  as\r\n\r\nsoon as you touch on administrative details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Thank you very much, Sir. From\r\n\r\nthe number of complaints I have heard lately in my\r\n\r\n\"Meet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  People\"  sessions, it is evident that  Police\r\n\r\nbrutalities   are   on  the  increase.   What   is\r\n\r\nunfortunate is that most people who have had rough\r\n\r\ntreatment dished out to them are reluctant to come\r\n\r\nforward  and  make official charges  for  fear  of\r\n\r\nsubsequent  retaliation, and also  they  can  ill-afford  the  time  and money  involved.  From  the\r\n\r\nstories  one  hears, the Police officers  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave refined their techniques of brutality to such\r\n\r\nan  extent  that they do not leave  any  tell-tale\r\n\r\nmarks  that  might incriminate them  subsequently.\r\n\r\nWith  their  knowledge of the rules  of  evidence,\r\n\r\nthey will make sure that subsequent identification\r\n\r\nis made impossible. In cases where the responsible\r\n\r\npersons  are  identified, there are always  ready-made  witnesses  among  their  own  colleagues  to\r\n\r\ntestify to their innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At most of our Police stations, the lock-up is\r\n\r\nbeing  used rather too liberally. I have heard  of\r\n\r\ncases  of  persons caught without driving licences\r\n\r\nor some such similar offences, and thrown into the\r\n\r\nlock-up until they are able to contact their homes\r\n\r\nfor  the licences to be produced. How many of  our\r\n\r\ncitizens, because of minor omissions or oversight,\r\n\r\nhave  been subjected to the indignities  of  being\r\n\r\ntreated  as  common criminals? I dread  to  think!\r\n\r\nOver   the  last  couple  of  years,  the   Police\r\n\r\nDepartment, as quite rightly pointed  out  by  the\r\n\r\nhon.  Member  for Sembawang, has  been  trying  to\r\n\r\npromote  the  image  of  being  \"friends  of   the\r\n\r\npeople\".  But unless we make sure that  atrocities\r\n\r\nof  the nature I have just mentioned are put to  a\r\n\r\nstop,  I  cannot  see  how the  Police  Force  can\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  being  accepted  as  friends  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all fairness, I must say that most of the\r\n\r\nmisconduct  took place among the  lower  level  of\r\n\r\nofficers,  often  without  the  knowledge  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers-in-charge, most of whom are  perhaps  too\r\n\r\nheavily loaded with work to be able to keep an eye\r\n\r\non  things. For example, the Officer-in-charge  of\r\n\r\nthe  Police station in Jalan Kayu also  has  under\r\n\r\nhis  control  Serangoon Gardens, Upper  Serangoon,\r\n\r\nPunggol, Nee Soon and Sembawang, which come to  an\r\n\r\narea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalmost  half of Singapore.

They should not\r\n\r\nworry   about  them.  They  should  not   be   too\r\n\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, may I just touch on the point raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Jalan Kayu? He raised  the  point\r\n\r\nthat allegations or complaints of Police brutality\r\n\r\nare on the increase. As far as I can see, I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether Police brutality is actually on  the\r\n\r\nincrease  or because people are now more conscious\r\n\r\nof  their  rights that there have been an increase\r\n\r\nin  the number of complaints. In any case, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  emphasise that, as far as the policy  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs or that of the Police\r\n\r\nis concerned, we do not tolerate Police brutality.\r\n\r\nI  made this very clear in my speech last year  at\r\n\r\nthe annual dinner of the Police Force - I think it\r\n\r\nwas sometime in September or October - that as far\r\n\r\nas  the Ministry of Home Affairs is concerned,  we\r\n\r\ndo not tolerate Police brutality. I agree entirely\r\n\r\nwith Members that if we do not check any instances\r\n\r\nof Police brutality, whatever we do in Police Week\r\n\r\nto  foster  good relations between the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  members  of  the Police Force  will  come  to\r\n\r\nnaught.  One  instance of an actual occurrence  of\r\n\r\nbrutality can undo all the good work that has been\r\n\r\ndone.  In other words, one single shower  can  wet\r\n\r\nthe  whole field. Of course, there are always  two\r\n\r\nsides to a case. Let us\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe fair. There will be allegations. Some are true.\r\n\r\nSome are motivated by revenge. Therefore, some may\r\n\r\nnot  be  true  or some may be true. But  I  assure\r\n\r\nMembers   that   every  complaint,  whatever   the\r\n\r\nmotivation, is thoroughly investigated  into.  For\r\n\r\nacts  of brutality by members of the Police Force,\r\n\r\nwhich  are substantiated, disciplinary action  has\r\n\r\nbeen  taken and will continue to be taken. Members\r\n\r\ncan be rest assured of that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point was about a person who committed\r\n\r\na  traffic  offence  was found without  a  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  and  was  put  in a lock-up.  Of  course,\r\n\r\ntechnically,  if  a  person  cannot  produce   his\r\n\r\ndriving  licence or an identity card to  establish\r\n\r\nhis  identity, he will be arrested.  But  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  instructions  to  members  of  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice that in cases where a person cannot produce\r\n\r\nhis  driving licence or identity card, but  if  he\r\n\r\ncan  satisfy  the Traffic Police of his  identity,\r\n\r\nthen  he  should not be arrested. Technically,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, he can be arrested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about the Police\r\n\r\nDivision  under which jurisdiction Jalan  Kayu  is\r\n\r\nincluded, of course, that Division covers  a  vast\r\n\r\narea  under  the charge of an 0/C. It is  a  Rural\r\n\r\nDivision.  Therefore, coverage tends to be  larger\r\n\r\nbecause  there is less population. It is like  the\r\n\r\ndelineation  of  the  constituencies.  Some  urban\r\n\r\nconstituencies are much smaller in area than rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies  which are very large  because  the\r\n\r\npopulation  in  the rural areas is  more  sparsely\r\n\r\nspread  out than in the urban areas. But  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  the  Police Divisions - we have  eight  Land\r\n\r\nDivisions - - which had been fixed years ago, have\r\n\r\nto be re-delineated. A review is now being made to\r\n\r\nre-delineate these Police Divisions in  the  light\r\n\r\nof  developments which have taken place in  recent\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member for Sembawang's\r\n\r\ncomments,  I  would like to thank him  for  paying\r\n\r\ntribute   to  us  for  setting  up  the  Community\r\n\r\nSecurity Force of the Vigilante Corps. Of course,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  has also at the same time made some complaints\r\n\r\nwhich  I will deal with now. One of his complaints\r\n\r\nis  that the Force is a bit too small. He wants it\r\n\r\nto  be enlarged. At the moment the strength of the\r\n\r\nCommunity Security Force is about 2,400.  However,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the initial success achieved  by  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Security Force, plans have already  been\r\n\r\nmade to expand it to 5,000 by July, 1974. Although\r\n\r\nthe  present force is mainly deployed in the urban\r\n\r\nareas  which  are  more crime  prone,  it  may  be\r\n\r\npossible  later  on to deploy them  to  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas in which the Member for Sembawang may have a\r\n\r\nvested interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the case put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Sembawang  for  increasing  the   travelling\r\n\r\nallowance  to  members of the Vigilante  Corps,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  say  that the Ministry  will  not\r\n\r\nconsider  any increase in the allowance  given  to\r\n\r\nnational  servicemen  in the Vigilante  Corps,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  the increase in bus fares and in  petrol\r\n\r\nprices.  The  reason  is  that  members   of   the\r\n\r\nVigilante Corps have been granted concession rates\r\n\r\nfor  travel  on buses. For a revised  fare  of  20\r\n\r\ncents  to  40 cents, the Vigilante Corps  national\r\n\r\nservicemen need only pay 20 cents. Thus, the total\r\n\r\nincrease  in  bus  fares would  only  be  marginal\r\n\r\ncompared to the total allowance paid for each duty\r\n\r\nsession.  On  the question of giving an  increased\r\n\r\nallowance to offset increases in petrol prices,  I\r\n\r\ndo  not think that an affirmative decision will be\r\n\r\nconsistent  with our policy, which the  House  has\r\n\r\nheard for the last one week, to persuade owners of\r\n\r\nprivate  vehicles to economise  in  their  use  of\r\n\r\npetrol.  Furthermore,  members  of  the  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps   are  deployed  for  limited  policing   in\r\n\r\nincreasing  numbers,  and  they  will  patrol  the\r\n\r\nvicinity  of  their own residence. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nnecessity for travel will be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nBut,  of course, the Member has mentioned a number\r\n\r\nof cases where members of the Vigilante Corps were\r\n\r\ndeployed in areas away from their residence. There\r\n\r\nmight  have been exceptions but as far as possible\r\n\r\nwe try to deploy them in the areas where they live\r\n\r\nfor obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the complaint about long hair, the\r\n\r\nMember has thought fit to raise it again, although\r\n\r\nI  had answered the question quite comprehensively\r\n\r\nlast  week.  In  any case, may I say  that  it  is\r\n\r\nalways our policy to take action against those who\r\n\r\nsport  long  hair. Of course, if  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  has  seen any Government  officer  with\r\n\r\nlong   hair,   he  can  himself  make   a   report\r\n\r\nstraightaway  and action will be  taken.  He  also\r\n\r\nmentioned that in some of the films, and I suppose\r\n\r\nhe  has seen them, the heroes have got long  hair.\r\n\r\nHe  said that this should be discouraged. I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  him  entirely but I thought he  should  have\r\n\r\nraised this matter with my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Culture, when his Ministry came up for debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also brought up the matter about fostering\r\n\r\nbetter relations between the police and members of\r\n\r\nthe public. May I say that this has always been at\r\n\r\nthe  back  of our minds, as a result of  which  we\r\n\r\nhave   been  conducting  Police  Weeks.  For   the\r\n\r\ninformation of Members, this year we are going  to\r\n\r\nhave   a  much  bigger  campaign  to  foster  this\r\n\r\nrelationship. It will come on in June. In place of\r\n\r\nthe  Police  Week  we are going to  have  a  \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore Crime Free\" campaign. Not only will  the\r\n\r\ntheme of good public relations with the Police  be\r\n\r\nstressed,  but  there are also other  themes,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  how members of the public  can  help  to\r\n\r\nprevent crime. They will be along the lines of the\r\n\r\nmass  campaigns which we have had,  for  instance,\r\n\r\nthe \"Keep Singapore Clean\" campaign, where Members\r\n\r\nof Parliament as well as the Citizens Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittees  are  involved. I hope the  Member  for\r\n\r\nSembawang will actively support this campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I beg your indulgence to\r\n\r\nsay  a  few words. I am most appreciative  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  assurances, but the unfortunate  thing\r\n\r\nis  that  when complaints of Police brutality  are\r\n\r\npassed   down  the  line,  to  what   extent   are\r\n\r\ninvestigations   conducted  seriously   by   those\r\n\r\nimplementing   Government  policy?  The   Minister\r\n\r\nhimself has just pointed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nout that he is not aware whether the incidence  of\r\n\r\nPolice  brutality has gone up or  whether  it  has\r\n\r\ncome down. That in itself indicates the complexity\r\n\r\nof   bringing  up  complaints  against  a   Police\r\n\r\nofficer.  If  a  person were to make  a  complaint\r\n\r\nagainst a particular policeman, he would very soon\r\n\r\nfind  that  another officer from the  same  police\r\n\r\nstation  is  sent to investigate, and the  officer\r\n\r\nwould take two or three hours or even a day or two\r\n\r\nharassing  the  complainant  with  all  sorts   of\r\n\r\nqueries  and  so on. Since the Minister  has  said\r\n\r\nthat  he is very concerned about maintaining  good\r\n\r\nrelations  with the public, will he  not  consider\r\n\r\nlooking into the existing rules and regulations to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  there are ways whereby  people  with\r\n\r\nlegitimate  complaints  can  \"short  circuit\"  the\r\n\r\nexisting  technicalities, and whether  or  not  in\r\n\r\nview   of   the  ineffectiveness  of  the  Central\r\n\r\nComplaints  Bureau  to set  up  his  own  separate\r\n\r\ncomplaints  bureau? In this way, I am  quite  sure\r\n\r\nthe  relationship will go a long way. This  is  my\r\n\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other aspect, I think it is not right to\r\n\r\nsay  that  the  population of the rural  areas  is\r\n\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> The density is lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The density might not be as\r\n\r\nhigh  as  the  urban  areas,  but  the  number  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  not  less.  So with  the  same  numbers\r\n\r\nspread  over  a much bigger area, is it  not  more\r\n\r\nreason for a much bigger staff to police the area?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I clarify the point\r\n\r\nabout  Police  brutality?  It  is  not  that   the\r\n\r\nMinister  or the Police Commissioner is not  aware\r\n\r\nof  it.  The point is, as I have said, we  do  not\r\n\r\ntolerate  Police brutality if there is  a  genuine\r\n\r\ncomplaint.  If complaints are made, they  will  be\r\n\r\ninvestigated. In fact, if the Member wants to know\r\n\r\nmore  about it, he can put in a Question for  oral\r\n\r\nanswer  and  he will get a detailed answer  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether any action has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  taken in respect of such complaints. I think\r\n\r\nthat will be more satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is about complaints and why\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public are reluctant to  complain.\r\n\r\nThe Member says that the Central Complaints Bureau\r\n\r\nis  ineffective.  I  do not think  the  Bureau  is\r\n\r\nineffective. We do get complaints from the Central\r\n\r\nComplaints Bureau. But at the same time  there  is\r\n\r\nno  reason  why members of the public  should  not\r\n\r\napproach their MPs. Our MPs are very hard-working;\r\n\r\nthey   look   after   the   interests   of   their\r\n\r\nconstituents. In fact, one complaint  came  to  me\r\n\r\nthrough   one  of  the  MPs,  and  it   is   being\r\n\r\ninvestigated.  I  do  not  think  we  should  have\r\n\r\nanother  bureau.  It  is  just  bureaucracy  being\r\n\r\nduplicated.  The MPs are the persons to  whom  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  should be made. MPs have been  writing\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to me on behalf of their constituents,\r\n\r\nand  there should not be any fear on the  part  of\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public to make complaints so  long\r\n\r\nas  they  are genuine complaints and not motivated\r\n\r\nby  some other ulterior motive. Of course, in  any\r\n\r\norganisation, we have the black sheep. II is  only\r\n\r\nwhen these complaints are investigated that we can\r\n\r\nknow  who the black sheep are, so that action  can\r\n\r\nbe taken. Instead of making general complaints, it\r\n\r\nwill  be  more  helpful  if  particulars  of   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  are given so that the  matter  can  be\r\n\r\nlooked into. We have to be fair to both sides, and\r\n\r\nwhen the whole truth is out appropriate action can\r\n\r\nbe taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, it is not that the MPs are\r\n\r\nnot  willing to help.

We like to be fair to the\r\n\r\nDepartment, as the Minister has pointed out, and I\r\n\r\ncannot  therefore just write to the  Minister  and\r\n\r\nsay  that  so-and-so has complained  that  he  was\r\n\r\nbeaten  up.

There must be statements  and\r\n\r\nso  on.  I  agree. But if the person who wants  to\r\n\r\ncomplain refuses to give a statement, we can  draw\r\n\r\nour own conclusions. Why do they refuse to give  a\r\n\r\nstatement? Members can say that the complainant is\r\n\r\nfrightened.  But  what can we  do  if  he  is  not\r\n\r\nwilling   to   substantiate  his  complaint?   The\r\n\r\ncomplaint  must be substantiated with a statement.\r\n\r\nIs  that so difficult for the complainant?  If  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not want to give a statement, then what  can\r\n\r\nwe  do? I appreciate the difficulties of the  MPs.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if a person comes to the Ministry\r\n\r\nhimself to make a complaint and he refuses to give\r\n\r\na  statement, what can we do?

There must be a reason why the recent\r\n\r\nmovie   \"Walking  Tall\"  was  so  popular  amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.

I  have  also said: it is quite  probable\r\n\r\nthat  the  increase  in the number  of  complaints\r\n\r\nmeans  that  members  of the public  are  plucking\r\n\r\ncourage  to come up and make their complaints.  It\r\n\r\nis a good thing. That is my feeling and assessment\r\n\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to talk about the Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps. I heard the Minister saying that he is  not\r\n\r\nprepared to increase the training allowance for VC\r\n\r\nmembers. I feel that the reasons given by him  are\r\n\r\ntoo  simple  to  be credible. In actual  fact,  we\r\n\r\nshould consider increasing the allowance for basic\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that they are paid only 25 cents per\r\n\r\nhour  for basic training, which is normally for  a\r\n\r\nduration of four hours. Therefore, they get only a\r\n\r\nmaximum   of  $1.  Although  they  are   given   a\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate  for  public  transport,   the\r\n\r\nminimum bus fare is 20 cents. Therefore, for a  VC\r\n\r\nmember to go to his centre for training, he spends\r\n\r\n40  cents for his journey to and fro. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nhe  may spend 30 cents on drinks. This amounts  to\r\n\r\n70  cents.  After  the four-hour  training  at  10\r\n\r\no'clock, he may have a snack which costs about  50\r\n\r\nto   80   cents.   Therefore,  according   to   my\r\n\r\ncalculation, a VC member spends at least $1.20  to\r\n\r\n$1.50  on a night out for training. Therefore,  to\r\n\r\npay him $1 is inadequate. In the past, with $1  he\r\n\r\ncould  possibly have a balance of 30 cents to  buy\r\n\r\ncandy  or  sweets for his children. But  time  has\r\n\r\nchanged.  I hope the Minister will look into  this\r\n\r\nmatter more seriously, because I cannot accept the\r\n\r\nreasons  that he has given for not increasing  the\r\n\r\nallowance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I fully\r\n\r\nsupport  the  views expressed by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang. I also feel that the reasons given\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister were too simple. At the  present\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  minimum bus fare is 20 cents.  There\r\n\r\nare  also  other  factors  to  consider.  So  this\r\n\r\nallowance  of 25 cents per hour is too  little.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Minister will reconsider this matter  and\r\n\r\ngive  adequate allowance to the trainees so as  to\r\n\r\nraise  their  morale in the present circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister may not have heard this very clearly\r\n\r\njust now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the allowance for the group leader in the\r\n\r\nVigilante Volunteer Corps is also inadequate.  The\r\n\r\ngroup leaders go on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npatrol  duty in various areas to supervise the  VC members.  In  discharging  such  patrol  duty   at\r\n\r\nspecific  times and at specific places, a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntravelling in their own cars is involved. If  they\r\n\r\nhave  to travel by taxi or by bus, it can even  be\r\n\r\nmore  costly.  If  they are asked  to  walk,  then\r\n\r\nunless  they are marathon walkers it is impossible\r\n\r\nfor  them  to do so. The present rate of allowance\r\n\r\nat  80  cents  per  hour for transport  for  these\r\n\r\npeople  is  too  little. I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ngive sympathetic consideration to this matter.  It\r\n\r\ndoes  not  mean that because we must economise  in\r\n\r\nthe use of fuel we should overlook this matter.

Just  now  I have put in  my  case  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  an increase in the  basic  training\r\n\r\nallowance.  The  reasons are that bus  fares  have\r\n\r\nbeen increased from 20 cents to 40 cents, and soft\r\n\r\ndrinks  from 20 cents to 30 cents. Furthermore,  a\r\n\r\nbowl  of  mee which previously cost 30  cents  now\r\n\r\ncosts   50  cents  or  80  cents.  So  the   total\r\n\r\nexpenditure per night's training is about $1.20 to\r\n\r\n$1.50.

Our\r\n\r\nrecords  have indicated that signs of drug  abuse,\r\n\r\nespecially  amongst our youths,  have  started  to\r\n\r\ndecline.  Strict enforcement action, such  as  the\r\n\r\nclosure  of  discotheques in November last  year,\r\n\r\nhas  to some extent helped to check the spread  of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse  among youths.

Of these, only\r\n\r\n507  or  6.4  per cent were committed  by  persons\r\n\r\nbelow  20  years  of age. This is  an  encouraging\r\n\r\nsign.  Since  the Misuse of Drugs  Act  came  into\r\n\r\noperation  in July last year, the Bureau  arrested\r\n\r\n111  drug traffickers and pushers. These purveyors\r\n\r\nof  misery and death have since been convicted  in\r\n\r\ncourt.  Their  sentences ranged  from  a  fine  of\r\n\r\n$5,000 and two strokes of the cane to seven years'\r\n\r\nimprisonment  and  two strokes of  the  cane.  The\r\n\r\nactivities  of  drug  trafficking  syndicates  are\r\n\r\nalways   cloaked  with  tightly  secured  secrecy.\r\n\r\nEnforcement agencies in other parts of  the  world\r\n\r\nhave   great   difficulties  in   penetrating   or\r\n\r\nobtaining  information  about  such  sophisticated\r\n\r\nsyndicates. The Central Narcotics Bureau faces the\r\n\r\nsame difficulty. However, the Bureau's sources  of\r\n\r\ninformation can be considered good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, some time back the\r\n\r\ngranting of citizenship was a major problem in our\r\n\r\nRepublic.   Today   the  situation   is   entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent. May I know what is the present ruling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that citizenship is not a right but\r\n\r\nonly  a  privilege. I agree with the  ruling  that\r\n\r\nthere   should   be   restrictions   in   granting\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  taking into account the  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  problems of the Republic. However,  some\r\n\r\ntime   back  it  was  announced  that  loyal  army\r\n\r\nofficials   would   have   special   consideration\r\n\r\nattached  to  their application  for  citizenship.\r\n\r\nWith  regard  to  this category of  applicants,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister a question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Singapore citizen with two Sons who\r\n\r\nwere born abroad. The boys joined him in 1958. The\r\n\r\nelder  boy faithfully joined the army as a regular\r\n\r\nnational  serviceman in 1961. He is  now  a  staff\r\n\r\nsergeant  and  is  married to a Singaporean.  They\r\n\r\nhave a child born in Singapore. In 1969 he applied\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship  and,  after  going  through  two\r\n\r\ninterviews, he is still waiting for a  reply.  Why\r\n\r\ndoes  it take so long to consider his application?\r\n\r\nIf  the  Minister  wants the particulars  of  this\r\n\r\ncase,  I would not mind giving him the application\r\n\r\nnumber for his easy reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the younger brother, after\r\n\r\nfinishing his studies in Singapore, went abroad to\r\n\r\ncontinue  his education. He has been returning  to\r\n\r\nthe Republic every year to renew his passport.  He\r\n\r\nhas  every  evidence to prove that he went  abroad\r\n\r\nsolely for educational purpose. He too had applied\r\n\r\nfor  his citizenship and was unsuccessful  in  his\r\n\r\nfirst attempt. Today this poor boy is in Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  an  academic degree, and is  still  awaiting\r\n\r\nanxiously for the result of his second application\r\n\r\nfor  citizenship. And because of  his  non-citizen\r\n\r\nstatus he is unable to get a proper job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe  had  also  loyally applied for  a  post  as  a\r\n\r\nregular serviceman at the CMPB. Two weeks later he\r\n\r\nreceived  a reply in the negative. But he  decided\r\n\r\nto  make  a  trip  to  the CMPB  to  ask  why  his\r\n\r\napplication was turned down. The official told him\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  not dealing with  graduates  and\r\n\r\nreferred  him  to the O.P.C. This  young  lad  was\r\n\r\ngiven  the  same reply. But this time he  was  not\r\n\r\ngiven  a verbal reply at the O.P.C, as the reasons\r\n\r\nwere regarded as confidential. It is believed that\r\n\r\nbecause of his non-citizen status, he is unable to\r\n\r\nget  on.  What is going to be the plight  of  this\r\n\r\nboy?  His  age  is  catching up and  he  is  still\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know why foreign women\r\n\r\nwho  are married to Singapore citizens take a long\r\n\r\ntime  to  get  their citizenship. Can the  Minster\r\n\r\nenlighten me on this subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I\r\n\r\ndeal with the Member for Anson first, and then the\r\n\r\nMember for Telok Blangah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Member for Anson agrees with\r\n\r\nGovernment's basic policy on citizenship, that is,\r\n\r\ngrant  of  citizenship  is  not  a  right  but   a\r\n\r\nprivilege,  and that there should be  restrictions\r\n\r\nin granting citizenship by taking into account the\r\n\r\neconomic  and social problems of the  Republic.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to inform him that there has  been  no\r\n\r\nbasic  change  in this policy. The main  criterion\r\n\r\nupon  which  citizenship is granted  is  that  the\r\n\r\napplicant should not be a liability but should  be\r\n\r\nable  to make a positive contribution towards  the\r\n\r\neconomic wellbeing of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession referred to by the Member\r\n\r\nregarding  service  in the  SAF  applies  only  to\r\n\r\npersons born on or after the 1st of January, 1949,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  those within the call-up age group  for\r\n\r\nnational  service.  Permanent residents  who  have\r\n\r\ncompleted      full-time     national      service\r\n\r\nsatisfactorily  will be eligible  for  citizenship\r\n\r\nprovided they have completed five years' residence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Citizenship status  will  only  be\r\n\r\nconferred   after   completion   o   five   years'\r\n\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case brought up by the Member refers to an\r\n\r\napplicant  serving as a regular in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces. To enable the Registrar of Citizens\r\n\r\nto  look into this case, I will appreciate  it  if\r\n\r\nthe Member will supply more details. In respect of\r\n\r\nthe  application  by the younger  brother  of  the\r\n\r\napplicant mentioned, the application may have been\r\n\r\nrejected  on the grounds that he has not fulfilled\r\n\r\nthe  residential  requirement. More  details  will\r\n\r\nalso  be required. I am surprised that the  Member\r\n\r\nhas not written to me on these two cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the foreign woman married to a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen, she must first  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration for permanent  residence\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Once permanent residence  has  been\r\n\r\ngranted,  she  must  reside in Singapore  for  two\r\n\r\nyears   before  she  can  qualify  to  apply   for\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizenship. The Member will appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  owing  to  the large number of  applications\r\n\r\nfrom  such persons, it will necessitate some  time\r\n\r\nfor the application to be processed. Since 1969 to\r\n\r\n28th  February, 1974, there were a total of 32,257\r\n\r\napplications from such persons. The applicant must\r\n\r\nalso take her turn in the queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the query by the Member for\r\n\r\nTelok Blangah, regarding the stencilled reply that\r\n\r\nhe  gets,  may  I  say  that whenever  he  gets  a\r\n\r\nstencilled  reply,  he can  be  assured  that  all\r\n\r\nenquiries   have  been  seen  to  and   personally\r\n\r\nprocessed  by  the  Registrar  of  Citizens.   The\r\n\r\nmajority  of  these enquiries are for  expeditious\r\n\r\nconsideration of applications and for  information\r\n\r\non  the progress of the application. As it is  not\r\n\r\npossible to indicate the outcome of an application\r\n\r\nuntil  a decision has been made, a standard  reply\r\n\r\nthat  the  application is under  consideration  is\r\n\r\ngiven.  And  in  view  of the  numerous  enquiries\r\n\r\nreceived  daily  at the Registry,  not  only  from\r\n\r\nMembers   of   Parliament  on  behalf   of   their\r\n\r\nconstituents but also from members of  the  public\r\n\r\ndirect,  the  reply is stencilled.  If  stencilled\r\n\r\nreplies  for such enquiries were not given,  there\r\n\r\nwould   be   a  waste  of  material  and  manpower\r\n\r\nresources. However, may I point out to the  Member\r\n\r\nthat the reply saying\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the application is under consideration means\r\n\r\nthat  there  is hope that the application  may  be\r\n\r\ngranted  at  a future date, no matter whether  the\r\n\r\nreply was handwritten, typed or stencilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is past guillotine time now.

But his application was turned  down\r\n\r\ndue  to  the fact that both of them had  not  been\r\n\r\nliving together for more than five years. Since he\r\n\r\nwas  unsuccessful in his effort to  get  his  wife\r\n\r\ndown he decided to migrate to join his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I be enlightened as to what is the\r\n\r\npresent  ruling  on the question  of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwanting their foreign wives to join them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point I would like to raise is: what\r\n\r\nprecautionary measures are being taken  along  our\r\n\r\ncoast  and  entry points to prevent the  entry  of\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants? Press reports state that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  unwanted people are in Singapore.  What  is\r\n\r\nthe Immigration Department doing about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nlaw  governing  the  entry of wives  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens for permanent residence is set out in the\r\n\r\nImmigration  (Prohibition of Entry)  Order,  1973.\r\n\r\nUnder  paragraph  3 of the Schedule  to  the  said\r\n\r\nOrder,  the wife of a citizen who has not  at  any\r\n\r\ntime  after  her  marriage been living  separately\r\n\r\nfrom  her husband for a continuous period of  five\r\n\r\nyears  may be granted permanent stay in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  law  has been in operation since  1959.  The\r\n\r\nunderlying  presumption is that  if  a  couple  is\r\n\r\nreally  attached to each other, they would not  at\r\n\r\nany time live separately for more than five years.\r\n\r\nIt  is not only possible for the Singapore citizen\r\n\r\nhusband  to  visit  his wife  in  her  country  of\r\n\r\nresidence, hut the wife herself can also  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore from time to time on a temporary  social\r\n\r\nvisit  pass,  even if she is not ready  to  settle\r\n\r\ndown  permanently here. To be equitable,  the  law\r\n\r\nhas  to  he  applied  equally  to  all  concerned.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if it can be proved that the  separation\r\n\r\nof  a  couple is due to circumstances beyond their\r\n\r\ncontrol,   my  Ministry  is  always  prepared   to\r\n\r\nconsider and approve their application on  special\r\n\r\ncompassionate grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the precautionary measures taken\r\n\r\nto  prevent entry of illegal immigrants, may I say\r\n\r\nthat  concerted action has been and is being taken\r\n\r\nby  the  Police  and Immigration authorities.  The\r\n\r\nMarine  Police,  while patrolling the  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters of Singapore, are on the look-out for small\r\n\r\nvessels   sneaking  in  with  illegal  immigrants.\r\n\r\nMembers  of  the Police Force, on  beat  or  other\r\n\r\nduties, carry out frequent checks to detect  those\r\n\r\nwho manage to enter. Surprise checks and raids are\r\n\r\nperformed   by   the  Immigration  Department   on\r\n\r\ninformation  received.  In  addition,  Police  and\r\n\r\nImmigration Officers carry out surprise checks  at\r\n\r\nvarious worksites all over Singapore. Such actions\r\n\r\nhave  resulted  in continuing arrests  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants throughout the year.

Whilst the\r\n\r\nGovernment is to be praised for this, the 13 civil\r\n\r\nservants  are  worthy of even greater  praise  and\r\n\r\ncommendation for the risks they had taken to  save\r\n\r\nthe   Government  from  this  misfortune.  It   is\r\n\r\nbelieved that initially the 13 officials had great\r\n\r\ndifficulty in obtaining landing rights  in  Kuwait\r\n\r\nuntil  the  leader  of  the  delegation  tactfully\r\n\r\npersuaded   the   authorities   there   to    make\r\n\r\nconcessions.  I  wonder if  the  Government  would\r\n\r\nconsider some form of commendation for these brave\r\n\r\nand loyal civil servants. Though the situation was\r\n\r\ntackled  very tactfully, can the Minister tell  us\r\n\r\nwhat  security measures have been taken to protect\r\n\r\nour islands and coasts? There may be other similar\r\n\r\nattempts in the future. After this recent incident\r\n\r\nat  Pulau  Bukom, what safety measures  have  been\r\n\r\nintroduced at these vital installations? Incidents\r\n\r\nof  sabotage  can occur again. We must  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat we do not relax in our vigilance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police patrol cars have quite often\r\n\r\nproved to be the losers when chasing criminals who\r\n\r\nescape  in more powerful cars. Obviously something\r\n\r\nmust  be done about this. Is there any possibility\r\n\r\nof  introducing a helicopter service to track down\r\n\r\ncriminals who flee from the law?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to draw the attention of this House\r\n\r\nto  the  streakers who run naked in some  American\r\n\r\nUniversity  campuses and then  into  the  streets.\r\n\r\nWithin  the  short space of a few days,  this  new\r\n\r\ntrend  has  spread to France, Japan  and  then  to\r\n\r\nHongkong.  Just as the mini-skirt, the long  hair,\r\n\r\nthe  drug  addiction and the free-sex parties  had\r\n\r\ncome  from  the West to the East and then  to  our\r\n\r\nRepublic,  it will not be long before  \"streakers\"\r\n\r\nwill  be seen running in our Singapore streets.  I\r\n\r\nwas  told that some of the girls and boys used  to\r\n\r\nloll naked at Changi Beach at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indecent or obscene exposure has been regarded as\r\n\r\na  minor offence and penalties of perhaps  $10  or\r\n\r\n$20 fines have been imposed. I would like to point\r\n\r\nout that a streaker's exposure is not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame  kind  of obscene exposure that we have  been\r\n\r\ndealing  in  the  past. This  is  part  of  a  new\r\n\r\nmovement  designed to destroy  the  youth  and  to\r\n\r\ndamage   the  socio-economic  structure   of   the\r\n\r\ncountry. This is a serious matter, and I urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  introduce  severe  penalties   for\r\n\r\nstreaking before they become a regular feature  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Our investments in our youth  would  be\r\n\r\nfrustrated  and, in order to save our  youth  from\r\n\r\nthis evil influence, may I venture to suggest that\r\n\r\noffenders  be  punished by caning for  the  damage\r\n\r\nthey   do  will  be  no  less  severe  than   drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the functions of our\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary.  How  do  they  serve   the\r\n\r\ncountry and the people?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist</b> rose -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind the Member for Potong\r\n\r\nPasir that we have six minutes to go. Will he,\r\n\r\ntherefore, leave three minutes for the Minister to\r\n\r\nanswer?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Baptist:</b> Yes. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\npresent  traffic situation on the  road  endangers\r\n\r\npedestrian  life immensely. Statistics  will  show\r\n\r\nthat  about  50 per cent of the road users  killed\r\n\r\nevery year are pedestrians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the need for higher standards of\r\n\r\nroads,  traffic markings, improved vehicle  design\r\n\r\nand   driver  training,  there  is  a   need   for\r\n\r\npedestrian  training.  The National  Safety  First\r\n\r\nCouncil  has  done a great deal towards  promoting\r\n\r\nthe  awareness of pedestrian safety with the  help\r\n\r\nof  the Traffic Police, the National Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress   and   other  interested  parties.   But\r\n\r\npedestrians keep dying on the roads. It appears as\r\n\r\nif  pedestrians are still unaware of  the  dangers\r\n\r\nlurking   on   the   asphalt  jungle.   Organising\r\n\r\npedestrian  safety  campaigns in  itself  must  be\r\n\r\nlauded. But are we achieving the results we want?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this lack of knowledge among\r\n\r\npedestrians can be corrected through education and\r\n\r\ncampaigns. But the devil-may-care attitude of some\r\n\r\npedestrians   cannot   be   erased   without   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of sterner measures. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  is failing in its responsibilities  if\r\n\r\nit  does  not  take  cognisance  of  the  terrible\r\n\r\ntragedies that are caused on our roads and come up\r\n\r\nwith an effective answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to protect those who seem\r\n\r\nnot  to  want to protect themselves.

Why is jay-walking  permitted?\r\n\r\nWhen   will  legislation  be  introduced  to  help\r\n\r\npedestrians  protect  themselves  and  other  road\r\n\r\nusers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I hope I can do justice\r\n\r\nto  the two Members but the time is limited. First\r\n\r\nof all, I agree with the observation of the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Anson   that  the  13  civil  servants   who\r\n\r\naccompanied the four Laju hijackers to Kuwait  had\r\n\r\nshown dedication to duty. In fact, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome    Affairs   is   considering   putting    up\r\n\r\nrecommendations  for  this  year's  National   Day\r\n\r\nAwards  for  those who had given  outstanding  and\r\n\r\ndedicated service during the Laju affair. However,\r\n\r\nthe award for commendation for outstanding service\r\n\r\nis  considered collectively by the Government once\r\n\r\na  year.  As it is not yet time for the Government\r\n\r\nto   consider  the  annual  awards,  it  would  be\r\n\r\ninappropriate  for me to comment further  on  this\r\n\r\nsubject without pre-empting Government's decision.\r\n\r\nImmediately  after the sabotage attempt  at  Pulau\r\n\r\nBukom, the Government reviewed the security of all\r\n\r\nour   vital  installations,  and  hence   security\r\n\r\nmeasures  were  immediately  put  into  effect  to\r\n\r\nprevent any similar attempt in the future. We have\r\n\r\nalso tightened the security of our Airport and the\r\n\r\nvarious  entry  and landing points of  our  Island\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member's point about Police cars\r\n\r\nchasing  criminals along Singapore roads, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to inform the Member that, contrary to  what\r\n\r\nhe  has  said,  the patrol cars  have  been  quite\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in apprehending criminals  fleeing  in\r\n\r\ncars  after  a chase. Only recently, a patrol  car\r\n\r\nfrom  \"E\" Division spotted a stolen vehicle,  gave\r\n\r\nchase and finally caught up with the wanted man to\r\n\r\nrecover  the  stolen vehicle and  apprehended  the\r\n\r\nculprit. There have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  instances  where  Police  patrol  cars  have\r\n\r\ncaught up with the fleeing vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point about the feasibility of introducing\r\n\r\nhelicopter  service  to  combat  crime  has   been\r\n\r\nconsidered by my Ministry. However, in view of the\r\n\r\nprohibitive  costs  involved,  both  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ninitial  outlay  to purchase the  helicopters,  to\r\n\r\nbuild  helicopter  pads, etc, and  the  recurrent\r\n\r\ncosts   of  maintenance  and  operation   of   the\r\n\r\nhelicopters  as  well as manpower training,  since\r\n\r\nthe Police has no qualified helicopter pilots, the\r\n\r\nproject  has been shelved for the time being.  The\r\n\r\nmain   reason   for  wanting  to   introduce   the\r\n\r\nhelicopter  service to combat crime,  however,  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  chase  criminals on land  but  rather  to\r\n\r\nundertake   harbour  and  sea  patrol  to   combat\r\n\r\nsmuggling  activities and illegal immigration,  to\r\n\r\nassist in traffic control and emergency evacuation\r\n\r\noperations  and  so on. It is not meant  to  chase\r\n\r\ncriminals. In view of the need to economise in the\r\n\r\nface  of  the uncertain world economic  situation,\r\n\r\nconsequent  upon  the energy crisis,  my  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  not be pursuing the project any further  for\r\n\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to streaking. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson's concern over undesirable trends, like  the\r\n\r\nstreakers  infiltrating into  Singapore,  is  very\r\n\r\nmuch  appreciated.  To-date  the  Police  has  not\r\n\r\nreceived any complaint of such incidents. However,\r\n\r\nit  is  envisaged that, except perhaps for a small\r\n\r\nminority, streaking would not appeal to our youths\r\n\r\nwho  are  basically Asian in outlook where modesty\r\n\r\nis  still  one of our strong tenets, I  hope.  The\r\n\r\nPolice,  however,  will  deal  severely  with  any\r\n\r\nstreakers  brought to their notice. Under  section\r\n\r\n24  of  the  Minor Offences Act, a first  offender\r\n\r\nwill  be  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding $250 or to imprisonment for a  term  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  one  month.  On second  and  subsequent\r\n\r\nconvictions, the offender will be liable to a fine\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding $500 or to imprisonment for a  term\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding six months. However, in  future  if\r\n\r\nthe  situation merits it, the Member's  suggestion\r\n\r\nthat  such  streaker  offenders  be  caned  or  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  other  forms of drastic  punishment\r\n\r\nwill be considered. Until\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthen,  I do not think the Member for Anson  should\r\n\r\nbe too unduly worried about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> I am not worried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> With regard to the point\r\n\r\nbrought  up  by  the Member for Potong  Pasir  for\r\n\r\neffective control of traffic, I agree that traffic\r\n\r\nsupervision is becoming increasingly difficult  in\r\n\r\nview  of the rapid increase in the number of motor\r\n\r\nvehicles and drivers on the road. Recognising  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  this function, the  Government  is\r\n\r\ngiving  high  priority to the Traffic Police.  For\r\n\r\nthe first time the Mobile Squad, which is the main\r\n\r\ntraffic law enforcement arm of the Traffic Police,\r\n\r\nhas  been  brought up to full strength early  this\r\n\r\nyear.  The  Mobile Squad is now operating  with  a\r\n\r\nfull establishment of five senior officers and 184\r\n\r\njunior  officers, 137 motor cycles,  22  scooters,\r\n\r\ntwo   pursuit  cars  and  two  sets  of   portable\r\n\r\nelectronic  traffic analysers, commonly  known  as\r\n\r\nspeed traps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also a selective enforcement squad of\r\n\r\ntraffic  police  organised  since  1972.  This  is\r\n\r\nbeginning  to  show results. The total  number  of\r\n\r\nroad  accidents  for the year 1973  is  35,977  as\r\n\r\ncompared with 36,125 for the year 1972, showing  a\r\n\r\ndecrease of 148 cases. At the same time, the death\r\n\r\ntoll  also registered a decrease. In 1973 a  total\r\n\r\nof  380 persons were killed as compared to 390  in\r\n\r\n1972,  showing a decrease of 10 in the  number  of\r\n\r\npersons  killed  in  road traffic  accidents.  The\r\n\r\ndecrease  is all the more significant considering,\r\n\r\nthe   fact   that  the  motor  vehicle  population\r\n\r\nincreases at the rate of 10 per cent per annum. It\r\n\r\nis  because of mounting traffic accidents that  we\r\n\r\nwill   be  launching  a  mammoth  \"Keep  Singapore\r\n\r\nAccident Free\" campaign in October this year,  and\r\n\r\nI  hope  Members of Parliament will  support  this\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
