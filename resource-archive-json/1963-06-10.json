The  first  session  was  on  the   28th\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1963,  convened at the instance  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government to discuss these  unresolved\r\n\r\nmatters.

The percentage, in our view,\r\n\r\nshould  have  regard to two factors,  namely\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Central Parliament and\r\n\r\npopulation, and not just capacity to pay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The whole of Singapore's surplus based on\r\n\r\n1962 calculations goes to the Federal Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement had already been reached on the 1st\r\n\r\nMarch,  1963, on the initial disposal  of  national\r\n\r\ntaxes collected in Singapore. The proceeds would go\r\n\r\nneither   to  the  Singapore  nor  to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nConsolidated Fund but to an account to be opened in\r\n\r\nthe Singapore branch of the Central Bank. The money\r\n\r\ncollected  must  physically  be  in  Singapore.  No\r\n\r\ndisbursement from the fund would be made until  the\r\n\r\napportionment between the two Governments has  been\r\n\r\nagreed  to  as to Singapore's contribution  to  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government for Federal services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government then proposed a scheme\r\n\r\nwhich  was  embodied in a paper  submitted  to  the\r\n\r\nInter-Governmental Committee for  consideration  at\r\n\r\nits  meeting  on  the  2nd  April,  1963,  held  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The main outline of the scheme  was  as\r\n\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Singapore's contribution for Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\nservices  should  be  based on actual  expenditure\r\n\r\nand  not  projected expenditure. The  contribution\r\n\r\nin   the   first  instance  should  be  based   on\r\n\r\nestimates  passed  by  the Federal  Parliament  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of these common Pan-Malaysian expenditure\r\n\r\nand  should  be  adjusted  after  the  Accountant-General  has  submitted  his  accounts  of  actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Capital expenditure on defence and internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  should be financed partly  from  revenue\r\n\r\nand partly from loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The percentage of Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontribution  should be based  on  three  factors,\r\n\r\nnamely,    its   representation   in   Parliament,\r\n\r\npopulation and economic growth through Time.  This\r\n\r\npercentage  will increase in accordance  with  the\r\n\r\ngrowth of industry in Singapore determined by  the\r\n\r\nannual   census  of  production  carried  out   in\r\n\r\nSingapore   since  1960.  The  percentage   should\r\n\r\ninitially  be below the proportion of  Singapore's\r\n\r\npopulation  to total Pan-Malaysian population  and\r\n\r\neventually rise beyond it, to the extent  that  it\r\n\r\nfalls short of it in the initial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government objected to Singapore's\r\n\r\nproposals on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the contribution for Pan-Malaysian defence\r\n\r\nand internal security expenditure was far too low.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) there would be troublesome accounting\r\n\r\ndifficulties which may lead to acrimonious  annual\r\n\r\ndisputes over the quantum of contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Federation Government would be put\r\n\r\ninto an invidious position of having its financial\r\n\r\naccounts scrutinised by a State Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) the surplus of the Singapore Government was\r\n\r\nnot   shared  and  made  available  to  the  other\r\n\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Razak, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation, then discussed the matter informally with myself and the Minister for Finance and stressed that the expenditure approach must be abandoned by the Singapore Government if any progress was to be made in these discussions. The contribution must be assessed in terms of\r\n\r\npercentage  of national taxes arising in  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  this  percentage could be subject to  periodic\r\n\r\nreview to ensure fairness to both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government then submitted an\r\n\r\namended  scheme.  This approach is  identical  with\r\n\r\nthat  to  the  first scheme, but  it  contains  two\r\n\r\nconcessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst,  defence and internal security  contribution\r\n\r\nby  Singapore was reduced from $93.6 million to $75\r\n\r\nmillion  a year. Next, Singapore retains  half  her\r\n\r\nsurplus,  based  on 1961 calculations,  instead  of\r\n\r\nsurrendering the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals of the Federation Government were\r\n\r\nthen  discussed at plenary sessions of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee on  10th  and  11th  April,\r\n\r\n1963.  The  Singapore Government, at this  meeting,\r\n\r\naccepted that Singapore's contribution need not  be\r\n\r\nrigidly   related  to  actual  Federal  expenditure\r\n\r\nincurred   and  we  attempted  to  work   out   the\r\n\r\napportionment pf national taxes between Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontribution  for  the  cost  of  common  Malaysian\r\n\r\nservices  and  the cost of Federal  departments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Singapore's State expenditure.  The\r\n\r\ngap between the estimates of the two Governments of\r\n\r\nthe  cost  of Federal departments in Singapore  was\r\n\r\nnarrowed  down  to $8.7 million.  This  is  due  to\r\n\r\ndiffering interpretations of the White Paper on the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of three Departments -  Income  Tax,\r\n\r\nCustoms and Broadcasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of $75 million for defence and\r\n\r\ninternal security expenditure was accepted  subject\r\n\r\nto a consideration of the following factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) British contribution to defence expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Details of the defence and internal\r\n\r\nsecurity   expansion  programme  have   not   been\r\n\r\nexamined by the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Capital cost of defence and internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  expenditure  which  may  amount  to  $18\r\n\r\nmillion  out  of  $75  million  would  be  met  by\r\n\r\ncapital  transfers  from  Singapore's  Development\r\n\r\nFund to Federation Development Fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The percentage agreed upon should be\r\n\r\nreviewed  periodically for the first five  or  six\r\n\r\nyears   until   defence  and   internal   security\r\n\r\nexpenditures have stabilised themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards non-defence expenditure, such as\r\n\r\nExternal Affairs, Parliament, the Civil List, etc.,\r\n\r\nthis  constitutes  a small part of  the  total  and\r\n\r\ncould be settled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout difficulty. We have agreed in deference  to\r\n\r\nthe    Federation   Government's   approach    that\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on  these  Federal  services,   except\r\n\r\ndefence  and  security, would  not  be  subject  to\r\n\r\nscrutiny  of actual expenditure. We were,  however,\r\n\r\nunable  to do so for defence and internal  security\r\n\r\nexpenditure,   because   future   expenditure   was\r\n\r\nunpredictable  and  periodic  reviews,  which   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  had  agreed,  would  ensure\r\n\r\nfairness to both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government had indicated that it\r\n\r\nis not prepared to meet any prospective deficits in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  Budget. Accordingly, Singapore's  view\r\n\r\nis  that there is no case for surpluses to be  paid\r\n\r\ninto  the  Federal  Treasury. If  the  question  of\r\n\r\nsharing  surpluses computed on the  basis  of  1961\r\n\r\nfigures   were   not  pursued  by  the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,   the   difference  between   Singapore\r\n\r\ncalculations   and   the  Federation   calculations\r\n\r\nbecomes very narrow indeed. The gap amounts  to  no\r\n\r\nmore than $13.7 million, or about four per cent  of\r\n\r\nwhat  we estimate national taxes in Singapore  will\r\n\r\nyield in 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had also offered to amend our laws to allow\r\n\r\nthe Federal Minister of Finance sufficient scrutiny\r\n\r\nover Singapore's tax collection machinery to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the collection of taxes, including Income  Tax\r\n\r\nand   Customs,  was  carried  out  efficiently  and\r\n\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two elements which have a bearing on\r\n\r\nSingapore's   financial   contribution    to    the\r\n\r\nFederation.  The first consists in  the  accounting\r\n\r\napproach,  and  the  purpose  is  to  forecast,  as\r\n\r\naccurately  as possible with the figures  at  hand,\r\n\r\nwhat  would  be the cost of Pan-Malaysian  services\r\n\r\nand  of  Federal  services in Singapore  from  1964\r\n\r\nonwards.  On  the  basis of this forecast,  we  can\r\n\r\nagree   on  the  apportionment  of  national  taxes\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore for Singapore's contribution\r\n\r\nto the Central Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second element consists of sharing\r\n\r\nSingapore's   prosperity   after   Malaysia.    The\r\n\r\nfinancial talks have run into difficulties  because\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government wants to introduce  this\r\n\r\nelement  into the apportionment ratio,  taking  the\r\n\r\n1961 surplus as the yardstick of prosperity. Whilst\r\n\r\nwe  agree  that  prosperity in Malaysia  should  be\r\n\r\nshared all round, we have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen unable to agree to this particular formula. It\r\n\r\nis   the   additional  prosperity   consequent   on\r\n\r\nSingapore's  entry  into Malaysia  that  should  be\r\n\r\nshared,  not  its  past prosperity  based  on  1961\r\n\r\nfigures  when  it  was not part of the  Federation.\r\n\r\nShould   for  instance,  Singapore  prosper   under\r\n\r\nMalaysia  with the advent of a Common Market,  then\r\n\r\nwe  must share this prosperity with the rest of the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting was held informally on Wednesday, 29th\r\n\r\nMay,  in  Kuala Lumpur. It was agreed in  principle\r\n\r\nthat   a   Common  Market  should  be   established\r\n\r\nthroughout Malaysia. This agreement will  pave  the\r\n\r\nway  for a settlement of the financial arrangements\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Federation of Malaya  and  Singapore.\r\n\r\nSingapore's  progressive  entry  into  the   Common\r\n\r\nMarket must necessarily mean the gradual erosion of\r\n\r\nits free port status as Malaysia industrialises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further informal meeting was held on Tuesday,\r\n\r\n4th  June,  in  Kuala Lumpur.  On  the  basis  that\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  arrangements will  be  made  for  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  Common Market  including  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a Tariff Board under a chairman to be\r\n\r\nnominated   jointly  by  the  two  Governments   by\r\n\r\nMalaysia  Day, we have agreed to consider that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Government   should   pay   a   certain\r\n\r\npercentage  of  our national taxes to  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government is also being asked to\r\n\r\npay by way of grant a sum of $50 million during the\r\n\r\nfirst   five  years  of  Malaysia  for  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of  the  under-developed   States   of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, namely, the Borneo territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance is at the moment carefully\r\n\r\ngoing  through  these proposals, in particular  the\r\n\r\npercentage  figures, and a reply will be  given  to\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government this week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set out only the main outline of the course\r\n\r\nof  discussions. When final agreement  is  reached,\r\n\r\nall  details  will  be  published  for  debate  and\r\n\r\nadoption in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, may I say that the rationale for\r\n\r\nthe arrangements in regard to Singapore lies in the\r\n\r\nfact  that  there will not, in fact, be a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  on  the basis of one of the present  eleven\r\n\r\nStates of the Federation. Had there been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  as advocated by some  Parties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  like  the Barisan  Sosialis,  then  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  Singapore's revenues  from  Income  Tax,\r\n\r\nCustoms, vehicle taxes and others will logically be\r\n\r\nsurrendered to the Central Government.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat  we  give up more than three-quarters  of  our\r\n\r\ntotal  revenue  instead of only  about  one-quarter\r\n\r\nunder the White Paper terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the White Paper, the usual\r\n\r\narrangements which are suitable in the case of  the\r\n\r\nother  States  in the Federation do  not  apply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  special position of  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nalso  shown  by the fact that it has been  allotted\r\n\r\nonly  15  seats  in  the House of  Representatives,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  below  the number it is entitled  to  if\r\n\r\nthere  was  complete merger. Within the  limits  of\r\n\r\nthis  position, we have tried and will continue  to\r\n\r\ntry  to  work  out  a  fair formula  to  share  our\r\n\r\nprosperity consequent on the formation of a  Common\r\n\r\nMarket for Malaysia. Needless to say, if the Common\r\n\r\nMarket  terms are inequitable in their  application\r\n\r\nas  between industries in the Federation of  Malaya\r\n\r\nand Singapore, then the whole basis of contribution\r\n\r\nto the Central Government must be altered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Order Paper I notice there is a motion standing in the names of the Member for Cairnhill and the Member for Tanglin. There are approximately ten minutes to go before we have, under Standing Orders, to move on to the discussion of the Development Estimates. With the\r\n\r\nconcurrence  of  the  House, I would  suggest  that\r\n\r\nsince this is a matter of some importance and since\r\n\r\nit  has  been raised not only by way of a  question\r\n\r\nbut  also by way of a motion, perhaps we could,  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the debate on the Development Estimates,\r\n\r\ntake the motion standing in the names of the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill and the Member for Tanglin.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of that debate I would be able to give  any\r\n\r\nsuch  further  information as  Members  would  deem\r\n\r\nproper or necessary for a proper discussion on this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On the suggestion made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  relevant Standing  Order  would  be\r\n\r\nStanding Order 10, paragraph (2) .

Would he consider publishing  a\r\n\r\nWhite Paper together with the memoranda referred to\r\n\r\nby  him, and particularly, Sir, in view of the very\r\n\r\ngrave connotations to that statement of his, that a\r\n\r\ncommon  market has been agreed upon,  which  rather\r\n\r\nsuggests  not a common market, Sir, but  a  Customs\r\n\r\nUnion; and whether he would also publish the  Rueff\r\n\r\nReport  for which we have been anxiously  awaiting,\r\n\r\nso  that  we  should  be in a  position  with  some\r\n\r\nresponsibility and seriousness to consider a matter\r\n\r\ngravely  affecting our future.  It  should  not  be\r\n\r\ntaken so hurriedly, Sir. This is a matter for study\r\n\r\nand  I  would  urge the Prime Minister to  indicate\r\n\r\nwhether he would consider the urgent publication of\r\n\r\na White Paper with the memoranda and the details he\r\n\r\nhas  given, and other details that might  help  us,\r\n\r\ntogether with the Rueff Report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> At some stage or other, either\r\n\r\nwhen negotiations are successfully concluded or are\r\n\r\nunable to he resolved, then all the memoranda  that\r\n\r\nhad  been  put in stating in detail the  respective\r\n\r\nstands  of  the  two Governments will  have  to  be\r\n\r\npublished together with the Rueff Report.

I\r\n\r\nhave  made this statement because a Member  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance Party has requested me to do so.

I would have preferred to allow his principals\r\n\r\nin  Kuala  Lumpur more freedom for  discussion  and\r\n\r\nnegotiations.  I  have  deliberately  slurred  over\r\n\r\ncertain  parts of the immediate proposals  that  we\r\n\r\nare  considering in order to give a certain  degree\r\n\r\nof  flexibility  of approach. I hope  \"flexibility\"\r\n\r\nwould  be  an  appropriate  word  for  both  sides,\r\n\r\nbecause   of  this  new  element  that  they   have\r\n\r\nintroduced  into  the discussions - the  question  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's prosperity being shared with  the  rest\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia. I say the House can have my assurance\r\n\r\nthat we will not move, and in fact we have no right\r\n\r\nto  move,  from the terms of the White Paper  which\r\n\r\nhad been voted upon by the people, unless there  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely a quid pro quo. If we are asked to  give\r\n\r\nsomething more than what we had agreed to give  and\r\n\r\nwhat  they had agreed to accept, then obviously  we\r\n\r\nmust  in  return have some benefit arising  out  of\r\n\r\nMalaysia, and I was glad on the 29th of last  month\r\n\r\nwe   reached  agreement  on  a  common  market   in\r\n\r\nprinciple.  The  detailed  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nCommon Market are contained in the Rueff Report. It\r\n\r\nwill have to be gone through by the officials.  But\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  the Member for Anson  that  nothing\r\n\r\nwould   give  me  more  pleasure  eventually   when\r\n\r\nnegotiations have been successfully concluded  than\r\n\r\nto  publish them in toto, and I think he, and  even\r\n\r\nmore so the merchants who have built a valuable and\r\n\r\nlucrative trade over the years on the basis of  our\r\n\r\nfree  port,  will have a great interest  in  seeing\r\n\r\nthat all this does not disappear in the chase of  a\r\n\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp for a common market.  I  think  he\r\n\r\ncan  take the assurance of my Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nwho  has met these merchants, that there is no such\r\n\r\nsudden disappearance of our free port at all  under\r\n\r\ncontemplation.

Sir, if a contract has already been  made\r\n\r\nfor  the  completion of this project by  a  certain\r\n\r\ndate, then usually for every day's delay after  the\r\n\r\ncontractual  date,  the contractor  has  to  pay  a\r\n\r\npenalty of a certain sum. If that is the case, then\r\n\r\nnaturally he will have to complete the contract  as\r\n\r\nsoon  as  possible in order to minimise his losses.\r\n\r\nNow  here  the Government is going to ask for  more\r\n\r\ncontractors to help and get itself involved  in  an\r\n\r\nexpenditure  of $600,000 more in order  to  achieve\r\n\r\ncompletion  in  February 1964. What  is  the  magic\r\n\r\nabout  the  date  February 1964 that  requires  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to spend up to $600,000 more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I can understand\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Members for Yio Chu Kang and Tanglin  are\r\n\r\nhotted  up  over  this item. I  myself  was  pretty\r\n\r\nhopping  mad and when I came back and I found  this\r\n\r\nexplanation  given  under Head D.19  - Multi-storey\r\n\r\nCar  Park.  I  have  since  made  inquiries  in  my\r\n\r\nMinistry and have discovered that actually the  sum\r\n\r\nof  $600,000 does not represent an increase  to  be\r\n\r\nasked for in this Assembly on account of our desire\r\n\r\nto  have  the car park completed in February  1964.\r\n\r\nThe  sum  of  $1 million was voted to be  spent  in\r\n\r\n1962.  However, only $400,000 was spent last  year.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the sum of $600,000 as indicated in this\r\n\r\nestimate  is  actually a revote. Members  will  see\r\n\r\nthat it is written down there quite clearly \"Multi-storey  Car  Park -Revote - $600,000\" which  we  are\r\n\r\nasking to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspent this year. There is no necessity - in fact,  I\r\n\r\nwould  be  the last person to come to this Assembly\r\n\r\nto ask for a sum of money of this size just to have\r\n\r\nthe car park completed by that date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, if this is a revote, it\r\n\r\nmeans that the original situation still holds good.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Four-Year Development Plan of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  this  Multi-storey Car  Park  is  just\r\n\r\ngoing  to cost $2 million - a million to be spent  in\r\n\r\n1962.  But  because $400,000 was spent,  therefore,\r\n\r\n$600,000 more will be required as a revote. But  in\r\n\r\nthe explanation given to us in this Paper, Sir, the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of this car park is  mentioned  at  a\r\n\r\ncost of $2.45 million. Where does the $0.45 million\r\n\r\ncome  from,  if it is a revote? It just  makes  the\r\n\r\nmatter more confusing. If it is $2 million, why can\r\n\r\nit  not  be mentioned as $2 million? Why should  $2\r\n\r\nmillion become $2.45 million and then we are led to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  it was an increase on  the  original\r\n\r\ncost of the Multi-storey Car Park? According to the\r\n\r\nexplanation given by the Deputy Prime Minister,  it\r\n\r\nis  still  $2  million. Then what is the  point  of\r\n\r\nputting in $2.45 million? Somebody must be  making\r\n\r\nsome mistake somewhere?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the mistake, if it arises,\r\n\r\nis  not on my account. The Member for Cairnhill  is\r\n\r\nquite  correct  when he pointed  out  that  another\r\n\r\n$450,000  has `been mentioned as the  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nMulti-storey  Car  Park. In fact,  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  will  remember reading in the Press  of  the\r\n\r\ndelay  which was experienced in building the multi-storey  car  park owing to the extra depth  of  the\r\n\r\npiling  which must le made and, in fact,  we  shall\r\n\r\ncome  later  to  this  Assembly  to  ask  for  this\r\n\r\nadditional sum of money to compensate for the extra\r\n\r\namount  of piling that will be needed. But  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment, these estimates are asking simply for a sum\r\n\r\nof  $600,000 as a revote, a sum of money which  was\r\n\r\nnot spent in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nadmits  that  an extra $450,000 would be  required.\r\n\r\nMay I ask -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> For piling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> For piling.

I think that is a wrong way of budgeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, it is really a matter for\r\n\r\nthe  Public Works Department to work out  increases\r\n\r\nthat  are required on the project. Only the sum  of\r\n\r\n$600,000  which should have really  been  spent  in\r\n\r\n1962   is  being  asked  to  be  revoted  and   the\r\n\r\nadditional  sum of $450,000 which is  required  for\r\n\r\nextra  piling would probably have to  come  up  for\r\n\r\nAssembly approval at some later stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\njust  now the Member for Cairnhill has pointed  out\r\n\r\nto   the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  that  from  this\r\n\r\nestimate it is clear that the Government,  when  it\r\n\r\nput  forward  this estimate, did not find  out  how\r\n\r\ndeep  the  piling has to be. That is why they  have\r\n\r\nmade this mistake in the estimate. Therefore, since\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  has  asked  for  another  $600,000,\r\n\r\naccording to him, this was a revote which  was  not\r\n\r\nspent in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Deputy Prime Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\ntwo  questions  which I raised just  now.  Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhen  will this Multi-storey Car Park be completed,\r\n\r\nand  how  long will the Government take to  recover\r\n\r\nthe  capital  expenditure on this Multi-storey  Car\r\n\r\nPark from the receipts from the car park?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The car park is expected to be\r\n\r\ncompleted sometime in 1964.

Now,  in  the  explanation   to   the\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Estimates, it is put down  as  $2.45\r\n\r\nmillion,  so  that, in effect, the Government  have\r\n\r\nalready  spent  $0.45 million more  than  they  had\r\n\r\nexpected to spend during that year. It would appear\r\n\r\nfrom the Deputy Prime Minister's statement that the\r\n\r\n$0.45  million has been incurred on account of  the\r\n\r\nextra  piling. If that is correct, then,  I  think,\r\n\r\nwith due respect to the Deputy Prime Minister, this\r\n\r\nHouse  has  not been given the proper  information,\r\n\r\nand  they  should have come to this House then  for\r\n\r\n$600,000 plus $0.45 million.

Now,\r\n\r\npresumably when we spend the $2 million  which  had\r\n\r\nbeen  voted for in the 1962 Estimates, the Assembly\r\n\r\nwill be asked to approve another sum of $450,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to\r\n\r\ndisagree.

It\r\n\r\nis  the  fourth year now. Over the past four years,\r\n\r\nwe have never seen the Government doing anything to\r\n\r\nhelp  improve `the agricultural techniques  of  the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  nor  have they done anything  to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  standard of living. From these Supplementary\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Estimates,  we  can  see   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  the past four years have  not  been\r\n\r\nlooking  after the livelihood of the rural  people,\r\n\r\nespecially the farmers and poultry-keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me point out to the\r\n\r\nGovernment that, in fact, this $740,000 should have \r\n\r\nbeen  spent in 1961 but in that year the Government\r\n\r\ndid  not use this money. Let me quote Paper Cmd.  6 \r\n\r\nof 1963 - Financial Statements for the Year 1961 - page 191.  \r\n\r\nThe  money  voted  to  be  used  for   Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment Projects in 1961 was $500,000.  But  by\r\n\r\nthe  end of 1961, the money spent in this field was\r\n\r\n$34,000 -  not even $35,000. Therefore, in 1961,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had only spent 6 per cent  of  the  sum\r\n\r\nvoted,  and the balance of about $460,000  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  touched.  In the 1962 Development  Estimates,\r\n\r\nthe  Government asked for a vote of  $470,000.  How\r\n\r\nmuch of this sum has been spent? This House has not\r\n\r\nreceived any financial report on this. In 1963, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  have also asked for a sum  of  $200,000\r\n\r\nfor  rural development projects. The sums voted for\r\n\r\nthe  two  years  1962 and 1963 total  $670,000  for\r\n\r\nrural  development projects. But up to now,  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how much the Government have spent  from\r\n\r\nthese  votes. If the Government have  spent  6  per\r\n\r\ncent  of the 1961 vote, then we believe they  could\r\n\r\nnot  have used more than ten per cent of the  total\r\n\r\nvotes  for 1962 and 1963. Therefore, we can clearly\r\n\r\nsee  that  from  1961 to 1963 the  Government  have\r\n\r\nspent   less  than  $70,000  on  rural  development\r\n\r\nprojects. That is my calculation. But the  Assembly\r\n\r\nhas  approved  $1.37 million for rural  development\r\n\r\nprojects,  and  we can therefore see  clearly  that\r\n\r\nduring the past three years the Government have not\r\n\r\nspent  $1 million to improve the standard of living\r\n\r\nof  the  rural  people and to help the  farmers  to\r\n\r\nimprove their production techniques. And today, the\r\n\r\nGovernment want the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssembly to approve $740,000 for this purpose. This\r\n\r\nonly  goes  to  show  the false  intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  because this sum of money  should  have\r\n\r\nbeen  spent during the past three years,  but  they\r\n\r\nhave not done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from these figures, we can clearly see that the P.A.P. Government have no intention of improving the livelihood of the rural people. They do not care about the living conditions of the farmers, the bankrupt rural economy, and the reduced prices of eggs. The\r\n\r\nGovernment  are  not  concerned  about  all   these\r\n\r\nmatters.  It is now 1963. In one year's  Time,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. will have to face the people's judgment. The\r\n\r\npeople know -  and the P.A.P. also know - that what the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government did in the past will be exposed.\r\n\r\nThe  coming  year  will also show that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will no longer receive the  support  of\r\n\r\nthe rural people. That is why the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nhave now come to the Assembly to ask for a vote  of\r\n\r\n$740,000  for  rural development projects  for  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of Veterinary Clinics  and  Extension\r\n\r\nCentres,  and  a  Fertilisers and  Mixtures  Supply\r\n\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, before the P.A.P. took office, they proposed to the rural people their so-called P.A.P. Development Plan, in which they promised that they would establish co-operatives and all sorts of things to help the rural people, especially the farmers. But so far they have done\r\n\r\nnothing  of  this  sort, and  they  still  have  no\r\n\r\nintention  of doing anything. The P.A.P. have  not\r\n\r\ndone  what they had promised to do. This is a  fact\r\n\r\nboth the P.A.P. and the people know very well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past four years the rural people have\r\n\r\nbeen very disappointed at what the P.A.P. have done\r\n\r\nfor   them.  Everywhere  you  can  see  the  people\r\n\r\nscolding  the  P.A.P.  Government  for  not  having\r\n\r\nimproved  their living conditions and helping  them\r\n\r\nin  their  agricultural production. They blame  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government for having increased their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nassessments,  taxes and all the other  things.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government cannot shirk their responsibility\r\n\r\nfor this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from this vote of $740,000\r\n\r\nthat is asked of this Assembly, we can see clearly that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhave always been trying  to seek  ways and means to deceive the people, \r\n\r\nand  to give  them  the  impression  that  the  P.A.P. are looking  \r\n\r\nafter  them and are taking care  of  their\r\n\r\nlivelihood   by  trying  to  give  them  veterinary\r\n\r\nservices,  fertilisers, supplies  and  things  like\r\n\r\nthat.  But  this sum of money, which was originally\r\n\r\nintended to be used for the people, has never  been\r\n\r\nused  to the fullest extent by the Government.  Now\r\n\r\nthe  Government have come to this Assembly  to  ask\r\n\r\nfor  this vote in spite of the fact that there have\r\n\r\nbeen  surpluses  every year. These  surpluses  have\r\n\r\nbeen  due to the fact that the Government have  not\r\n\r\nbeen  able to carry out its work. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance should resign since he is unable to use all\r\n\r\nthe vote that has been approved. I am going to tell\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P. Government that it is impossible now for\r\n\r\nthem to cast a smokescreen to deceive the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore. The so-called development of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nis nothing more than a paper tiger. It is something\r\n\r\nthat  is good to look at, but there is nothing  in\r\n\r\nsubstance. Therefore, I want the Government to give\r\n\r\nus the full facts about these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now that the Government have come to this House to ask for a supplementary vote of $740,000 for rural development and other purposes, it shows that the P.A.P. have failed in their work in this respect. They have failed to look after the interest and livelihood of the\r\n\r\npeople in the rural areas. Now that they are  going\r\n\r\nto face their death, they are fabricating imaginary\r\n\r\nfigures and plans in order to deceive the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang seems to be out of his mind today.

I have mentioned in this  House\r\n\r\nof  the  services  that have been supplied  to  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  and the fishermen. What we are  requesting\r\n\r\ntoday  is money to implement more schemes  to  help\r\n\r\nthe farmers and the fishermen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the farmers in Singapore know that today if\r\n\r\nthey need inoculations for their chickens and pigs,\r\n\r\nthey  can easily get them from either the extension\r\n\r\ncentres  that  we  have built  or  from  the  rural\r\n\r\ncommunity centres which we have recently built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you know, these rural community centres\r\n\r\nare built not only to supply amenities to the rural\r\n\r\nfolks but also to supply veterinary services to the\r\n\r\nfarmers, the pig rearers, the poultry rearers, etc.\r\n\r\nWe   have  introduced  artificial  insemination  in\r\n\r\nSingapore for pigs. As I have said before  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse, Sir, Singapore is the first tropical country\r\n\r\nto introduce this service. Already numerous farmers\r\n\r\nwho  have  pigs  in  their farms  are  getting  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in 1959 when we came to office, there were\r\n\r\ntwo  veterinary  extension  centres  in  existence.\r\n\r\nSince  then,  we  have built  three  more  of  such\r\n\r\nextension  centres - one in Changi, one  in  Yio  Chu\r\n\r\nKang and one in Tampines. The fourth one at Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  is  nearing completion. From these  extension\r\n\r\ncentres,  we  supply  veterinary  services  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  who live around these areas and certain  of\r\n\r\nour  services are even brought to the doorsteps  of\r\n\r\nthe farmers.

In the Development Estimates for 1963, there\r\n\r\nis   a  vote  of  $200,000  for  rural  development\r\n\r\nprojects. This money is committed to the artificial\r\n\r\ninsemination  service, the anti-pest  service,  the\r\n\r\nprovision of fisheries training and also  one  film\r\n\r\nunit,  and  the  building of the  fourth  extension\r\n\r\ncentre  at  Thomson Road. What we  are  asking  the\r\n\r\nAssembly is a provision of $155,000 for three  more\r\n\r\nveterinary extension centres to be built in Jurong,\r\n\r\nMandai  and later on one to be built in the Punggol\r\n\r\narea. We are planning ahead so that the benefits of\r\n\r\nall  these  services can be brought to farmers  all\r\n\r\nover the island of Singapore, including Pulau Ubin,\r\n\r\nPulau Tekong and the Southern Islands. We know that\r\n\r\nwhilst   it  has  been  possible  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nveterinary  services  on Singapore  Island  by  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of veterinary clinics and  extension\r\n\r\ncentres, it has not been possible to provide  these\r\n\r\nservices  to  the  adjacent islands  of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nparticularly  Pulau  Ubin,  Pulau  Tekong  and  the\r\n\r\nSouthern  Islands.  It is therefore  intended  that\r\n\r\nsuch  services should be extended to these islands,\r\n\r\nand  we intend to build a mobile team to move  from\r\n\r\nisland to island and from one part of the island to\r\n\r\nanother  part  of the same island where  there  are\r\n\r\nconcentrations of farmers. In order to render these\r\n\r\nmobile  services, a properly fitted boat which  can\r\n\r\ncarry  up  to  ten persons with a reasonable  speed\r\n\r\nwill  be  required.  To provide  this  mobile  unit\r\n\r\nservice,  we  require $40,000. On top of  that,  we\r\n\r\nintend to initiate a Scheme whereby we will produce\r\n\r\nsludge  and chemical fertilizers and sell  them  at\r\n\r\ncost   to   farmers  through  all  our   veterinary\r\n\r\nextension centres and the rural community centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mammen (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Mammen):</b> Order.

So  I  would\r\n\r\nlike the Minister for Health and Law to assure this\r\n\r\nHouse  that the future allocation of hawker pitches\r\n\r\nin  these markets will be made on a very fair basis\r\n\r\nwithout any party bias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr K.

Byrne):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, in modern town  planning,\r\n\r\npublic  markets are recognised as essential  social\r\n\r\namenities and often the markets form the centre  of\r\n\r\nthe  shopping  area  of the neighbourhood.  In  the\r\n\r\nplanning  of  the various estates, the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  have  been  requested  by   the\r\n\r\nMinistry to include in their layout suitable  sites\r\n\r\nfor   markets  in  relation  to  the  size  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  itself and the needs of the people.  In\r\n\r\nconformity   with  this  planned   development   of\r\n\r\nessential amenities for the public, it is necessary\r\n\r\nthat  markets in the Board's housing estates should\r\n\r\nbe  provided. The responsibility for the  provision\r\n\r\nof  markets  lies with the Ministry of Health,  and\r\n\r\nthe   Housing  and  Development  Board  have   been\r\n\r\nrequested   to   provide  in  their  planning   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  such markets  as  part  of  their\r\n\r\noverall development plan. Experience has shown that\r\n\r\nthe  construction costs of markets by the Board  as\r\n\r\nan  integrated project result in development  at  a\r\n\r\nmuch lower cost, so that the market extensions  can\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphased suitably with the development of the Board's\r\n\r\nestates.

This market is estimated  to  serve  a\r\n\r\nresident  population of 70,000.  The  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding will be $375,000 and the cost of equipment\r\n\r\nwill be $31,610. The second market will be built at\r\n\r\nJalan  Merpati,  that  is in  the  Macpherson  Road\r\n\r\n(South)  area. It is to be a market of 100  stalls.\r\n\r\nIt  is  proposed  that  this market  will  serve  a\r\n\r\nresident population of 17,000. The building cost is\r\n\r\n$180,000 and the cost of equipment is $31,600.  The\r\n\r\nthird market is to be a market of 150 stalls to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  in  Beo Lane in the Bukit Ho Swee  area.  It\r\n\r\nwill  serve  a resident population of  48,000.  The\r\n\r\nbuilding cost is estimated to be $225,000  and  the\r\n\r\ncost of equipment, $71,990. The fourth market is  a\r\n\r\nmarket of 100 stalls to be built in Tang-un Halt in\r\n\r\nthe Queenstown neighbourhood (Four). It is expected\r\n\r\nthat  this  market will serve a resident population\r\n\r\nof   32,000;  the  cost  of  construction  will  be\r\n\r\n$190,000  and  the cost of equipment, $31,600.  The\r\n\r\nfifth market is to be a 100-stall market, off Jalan\r\n\r\nBatu  in  Tanjong Rhu. It is expected  to  serve  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of 24,000 residents. The  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding   will  be  $190,000  and  the   cost   of\r\n\r\nequipment, $31,600. The sixth market is  to  be  at\r\n\r\nHoy  Fatt Road. This is a 100-stall market  in  the\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hill Estate. It is expected to  serve  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of 18,000; the cost of construction  is\r\n\r\n$190,000; the cost of equipment is $31,600. It must\r\n\r\nbe  pointed  out  that the population  figures  are\r\n\r\nestimates  of  population growth  in  the  area  of\r\n\r\nredevelopment alone. In fact, experience has  shown\r\n\r\nthat  these  markets, when completed, can  serve  a\r\n\r\nmuch larger population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, apart from markets in the Housing Board areas, hawker pitches are also being provided by the Housing and Development Board and up to date, the Board has provided 35 pitches in the Tanjong Rhu Estate, costing $25,000. In addition, the Board\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  built 35 pitches in the Alexandra Hill Estate,\r\n\r\ncosting  $11,000. The Board has already built  half\r\n\r\nof  the  312 hawker pitches in the Kallang  Estate,\r\n\r\ncosting   $40,000.   The   Board   will   soon   be\r\n\r\nconstructing 88 new hawker pitches, costing $35,000\r\n\r\nin the Bukit Ho Swee Estate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of hawker pitches in Housing and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board Estates has been designed  as  an\r\n\r\nextension  of  the  enlightened  approach  to   the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  hawkers. In a number  of  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  estates,  hawker  stalls  began\r\n\r\ndeveloping and there was a danger that these modern\r\n\r\nhousing  estates would be reduced to slums if  such\r\n\r\nhawker development were allowed to go on unchecked.\r\n\r\nIn  order to meet the demands of the population for\r\n\r\nhawker  facilities and at the same Time to exercise\r\n\r\neffective  control and maintain the  estates  in  a\r\n\r\nsanitary  and aesthetic state, hawker pitches  have\r\n\r\nbeen provided and are being developed in all recent\r\n\r\ndevelopment. The cost of such construction is borne\r\n\r\nentirely by the Board. The arrangement between  the\r\n\r\nBoard  and  the  Markets and Hawkers Department  is\r\n\r\nthat  70  per  cent of the fees  are  paid  to  the\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Board for recovery of costs\r\n\r\nand  30  per  cent is retained by the  Markets  and\r\n\r\nHawkers   Department  for  maintenance  and   water\r\n\r\ncharges. The licence fees are $10 or $15 per stall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of providing suitable alternative sites\r\n\r\nfor  hawkers has been followed in the case of other\r\n\r\nhawker  areas.  Those  are  areas  other  than  the\r\n\r\nHousing Board areas, where it has been necessary to\r\n\r\nmove   hawkers   to   deal  with   development   or\r\n\r\nredevelopment,  traffic  obstruction  or   hazards,\r\n\r\ninterference with public cleansing and other health\r\n\r\nactivities. This policy has been satisfactory  and,\r\n\r\nin  a  number of cases where such resettlement  has\r\n\r\nbeen necessary, there has been good co-operation on\r\n\r\nthe  whole  from the hawkers. Such resettled  areas\r\n\r\ninclude East Coast Road, the big bottleneck at  the\r\n\r\njunction  of Joo Chiat Road and the Changi  Market,\r\n\r\nthe  hawker congestion outside Killiney Road Market\r\n\r\nand  the  vicinity of the Lido Theatre  in  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hawker policy matters are carefully discussed\r\n\r\nby  the  Hawkers Advisory Committee and all aspects\r\n\r\nof  the  problem are carefully examined before  any\r\n\r\naction is decided upon.

According to the Government explanation, because Malaysia will be established on 3 1st of August, therefore it is necessary to extend short-wave\r\n\r\nradio transmission to the three Borneo territories.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Government has asked this  House  to\r\n\r\napprove  this vote of $1,350,000 for this  purpose.\r\n\r\nThe  so-called Ministry of Culture is, in fact, the\r\n\r\npropaganda machinery of the P.A.P. Radio  Singapore\r\n\r\nis,  in fact, the voice of the P.A.P. From the past\r\n\r\nseries of incidents,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore have come to  know\r\n\r\nthat   Radio   Singapore  is  the  main  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery  of  the P.A.P. Government,  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  already bankrupt in  the  eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  it  has  no possibility  of  convening\r\n\r\nrallies,  street conferences and other meetings  of\r\n\r\nthe   people.  That  is  why  the  only  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery  available to it is to make  use  of  the\r\n\r\nmoney   of   the  people  for  its  own   political\r\n\r\npropaganda,  that is, through Radio Singapore.  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, at present the facilities of  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore are more than sufficient and there is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity to expand them further by spending  $1.35\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can know that the P.A.P. not only wants to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  party propaganda throughout Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore,   but  also  it  wants  to  extend   its\r\n\r\npropaganda to the three Borneo territories  because\r\n\r\nit  hopes to set up branches there. But so  far  it\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  successful. No  members  have  been\r\n\r\nforthcoming. Because the P.A.P. is unable to set up\r\n\r\nbranches in the Borneo territories, it has now come\r\n\r\nto   think  of  this  method  of  extending   radio\r\n\r\nservices. It has now come to this House to ask  for\r\n\r\na  vote of $1.35 million to extend short-wave radio\r\n\r\ntransmission  to the component parts  of  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the Government's explanation,  it  is\r\n\r\nscheduled to spend $550,000 in 1962 on the National\r\n\r\nArt  Gallery,  but so far we have not seen  whether\r\n\r\nwork  has  started on it. The Minister for  Culture\r\n\r\nhas  never  mentioned about it at all,  because  he\r\n\r\nknows  that  the  National Art  Gallery  cannot  do\r\n\r\nanything  in the field of political propaganda  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  That is why although the vote  on  the\r\n\r\nNational Art Gallery was already there in the  1962\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates, the P.A.P. did not carry out\r\n\r\nthe project because it found it was of no political\r\n\r\nuse  to  it. Mr Speaker, in col. 2288 of  Hansard,\r\n\r\nVol. 15 No. 24 dated 15th December, 1961, when  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Farrer  Park asked  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nCulture about the building plan of the National Art\r\n\r\nGallery,  the Minister for Culture pointed  out  to\r\n\r\nthe House that the plan would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  implemented in 1962. But he had not carried out\r\n\r\nwhat  he had promised in this Assembly. But now  he\r\n\r\nhas  transferred this $550,000 for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nextending   the   short-wave   radio   transmission\r\n\r\nservice. Mr Speaker, this sum of $1.35 million  is\r\n\r\nnot  small. It is collected from the people in  the\r\n\r\nform of taxes and it amounts to one-quarter of  the\r\n\r\nassessment revenues for 1963. Since the P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  office, it has introduced various taxes,  one\r\n\r\nof which is assessment tax. The present Government,\r\n\r\nin order to extend the services of Radio Singapore,\r\n\r\nintends now to use a further $1.35 million which is\r\n\r\none-quarter  of  the property tax  for  this  year,\r\n\r\n1963.  But  we  would like to ask this.  After  the\r\n\r\nextension  of  this  radio service,  what  can  the\r\n\r\npeople   get?   Can  their  living  conditions   be\r\n\r\nimproved? Can sanitary conditions be improved? Will\r\n\r\nthere be more schools? Why does the Government  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  use  this big sum of money  to  help  the\r\n\r\npeople improve their standard of living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while ago the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment boasted about helping the rural  people\r\n\r\nto improve their livelihood and standard of living.\r\n\r\nGranted  that the money to be spent is  only  about\r\n\r\n$740,000. But $1.35 million is proposed to be spent\r\n\r\njust for the extension of radio services, which sum\r\n\r\nis  derived from various forms of taxes paid by the\r\n\r\npeople, such as property tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this House has a duty to prevent the P.A.P. from squandering away public money and the wealth of this country in schemes like this extension of radio service. Through Radio Singapore, the P.A.P has also threatened the people. For instance, on May Day after every interval of a few minutes, Radio Singapore made an\r\n\r\nannouncement threatening workers repeatedly not  to\r\n\r\nattend the May Day celebration of the S.A.T.U. for\r\n\r\nfear  of  violence. On the other hand, the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthrough  Radio  Singapore,  urged  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nattend  the N.T.U.C. May Day rally. All this proves\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. is abusing State\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmachinery   to  achieve  its  political   ends   by\r\n\r\npolitical  propaganda. That is why we cannot  allow\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. to  squander  away  any  more   money\r\n\r\nbelonging to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it comes to this House asking for a vote of\r\n\r\n$1 .35 million for the extension of radio services.\r\n\r\nI  suggest that this vote should be withdrawn,  and\r\n\r\nthat  this sum of money could be put to better  use\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall be\r\n\r\nmoving  my  amendment No. (2)* if I find  that  the answers  of  the  Minister  for  \r\n\r\nCulture  are   not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n*  Amendment (2) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head D.49 be reduced by the whole\r\n\r\nsum in respect of subhead 4.\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member does not choose to speak\r\n\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Can I speak now, Sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Certainly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture  a few  questions:  firstly,\r\n\r\nwhether   this  expenditure  is  really  necessary;\r\n\r\nsecondly, whether it is so urgent that it  must  be\r\n\r\nspent   before  the  Federation  of   Malaysia   is\r\n\r\nestablished; thirdly, if it should be  spent  after\r\n\r\nthe  establishment of the Federation  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwould  the  expenditure not be shared  between  the\r\n\r\nGovernments  of  the  Federation  of   Malaya   and\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I think I will answer the first  two\r\n\r\nquestions  raised  by the Member for  Tanglin.  His\r\n\r\nfirst  question is: is it necessary to expand radio\r\n\r\nservices before Malaysia is established? The  point\r\n\r\nabout  the time factor - whether it should  be  spent\r\n\r\nbefore Malaysia is established or not - is irrelevant\r\n\r\nbecause radio services have to be expanded to cover\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories as well through the  short-wave  band  for the simple reason that  practically\r\n\r\nall  the radio services in the five territories are\r\n\r\noperating  on  a  short-wave  band,  including  the\r\n\r\nBorneo territories where they are    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestablishing  a more powerful short-wave  band.  We\r\n\r\nourselves therefore have to follow suit, regardless\r\n\r\nof what happens after Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other reason is that, as the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  knows, we have a commercial service.  Once\r\n\r\nevery  other commercial service goes on short  wave\r\n\r\nand  we stick to medium wave, then perhaps we shall\r\n\r\nhave to ask for more than the $1.3 million that  we\r\n\r\nare  asking for today. We have to go on short wave,\r\n\r\nif  for  no  other  reason  than  to  establish   a\r\n\r\ncommercial service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, it follows on what the Member for\r\n\r\nYio Chu Kang has been ranting against. We are quite\r\n\r\ngratified,  Sir,  that  the  Communists  and  their\r\n\r\npuppets  here  have developed a  phobia  about  our\r\n\r\nradio  propaganda. We are not afraid of propaganda.\r\n\r\nThey  are  afraid  of propaganda.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  has  every reason to  be  afraid  of  a\r\n\r\nfurther  extension of our radio services  to  cover\r\n\r\nthe   Borneo   territories  as  well,  because   if\r\n\r\nperformance  within our limits on  medium  wave  in\r\n\r\nSingapore has cost him dearly, then I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthat if our performance over radio forums could  be\r\n\r\nheard  throughout the Borneo territories,  many  of\r\n\r\nhis  Communist supporters in the Borneo territories\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  have cause to doubt  whether  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis,  which  has  always  put  itself\r\n\r\nforward  as the spearhead of the Communist movement\r\n\r\nin Malaysia, is a dependable ally. Today they are a\r\n\r\nbroken wing if we are to pay any credence to  their\r\n\r\nown  propaganda  in  the Barisan newspapers.  Today\r\n\r\nthey  are relying on guerilla warfare in the Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories to save them from the predicament  they\r\n\r\nare  in. We are quite open about it. It is the duty\r\n\r\nof  a  democratic  society to  use  the  propaganda\r\n\r\nmachinery.  It has always been here. It is  nothing\r\n\r\nnew.  We have never established it. When the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown and the Member for Yio Chu Kang were\r\n\r\non  this side of the House, they had no occasion to\r\n\r\nraise  questions  about the money spent - whether  it\r\n\r\nwas  worth while spending money on radio. In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey   were  anxious  that  our  radio  should   be\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  But  today, now  that  they  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger on this side and no longer\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfighting  the  cause  of  democracy  but  obviously\r\n\r\nfighting  the  cause  of the Communists  and  alien\r\n\r\nconfrontationists, they know that the radio can  be\r\n\r\nused  effectively to stifle them and  to  conscribe\r\n\r\nthem, as we had shown them in the referendum.  That\r\n\r\nis why, Sir, they are terrified of any extension to\r\n\r\nthe  radio  services because it would be  one  more\r\n\r\nblow against their propaganda and one more means to\r\n\r\nexpose Communist falsehoods, Communist strategy and\r\n\r\nCommunist propaganda.

We have never made any  propaganda\r\n\r\nfor  the  Party. We have always made propaganda  on\r\n\r\nbehalf   of   the  democratic  cause  against   the\r\n\r\nCommunists. I challenge him at any moment  to  show\r\n\r\nany  one occasion where the radio has been used for\r\n\r\nparty propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a tribute to us that he equates  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to the democratic cause in general. We  have\r\n\r\nalways   challenged,  accused,  and   exposed   the\r\n\r\nCommunists  but  never have we ever  gone  and  put\r\n\r\nacross on any occasion purely party propaganda.  We\r\n\r\nare  able to deal with them in this field  when  we\r\n\r\nhave  occasion  to  meet  them  outside  the  radio\r\n\r\nstudios.  But  over the radio, our main  cause  has\r\n\r\nbeen to espouse democracy in our fight against  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.  They  know very well,  Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\nreferendum proved that for the first Time. That  is\r\n\r\none  of the reasons why we are expanding our  radio\r\n\r\nservices.  The Communists believe in pro, paganda,\r\n\r\nbut it is quite a different type of propaganda when\r\n\r\nthey send school children carrying Ovaltine or Milo\r\n\r\nor  milk  bottles  and going around  whispering  to\r\n\r\nfarmers  that  the Government are  doing  this  and\r\n\r\ndoing  that. They know that the blank votes in  the\r\n\r\nreferendum were least in the city areas where there\r\n\r\nis  adequate radio coverage, but in the rural areas\r\n\r\nwhere   there  is  not  adequate  radio  propaganda\r\n\r\ncoverage,  the  blank votes were  high.  Since  the\r\n\r\nreferendum,  it has been our policy to  extend  the\r\n\r\npublicity services, including radio and television,\r\n\r\nin the rural areas which are their last stronghold.\r\n\r\nThey know today that that stronghold is being taken\r\n\r\naway  from  them. Therefore, there is every  reason\r\n\r\nfor  them  to come out now and say that  the  $1.35\r\n\r\nmillion  that  is being spent on the  extension  of\r\n\r\nradio  services is a waste of money and why can  we\r\n\r\nnot  build  houses  and clinics.  We  are  building\r\n\r\nhouses.  In  fact,  Sir, the  damage  done  by  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis and the Communists by  trying  to\r\n\r\nsabotage  the  economy  of  the  country   and   by\r\n\r\nmisleading workers to artificial strikes  has  cost\r\n\r\nthe  country far more than the $1,300,000  that  we\r\n\r\nare  going  to  spend on radio. This $1.35  million\r\n\r\nwill ensure that the capacity to damage the economy\r\n\r\nof  the  country by the Communists and the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  is more effectively reduced.

The  inordinate hurry being shown  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture to have  two  very  expensive\r\n\r\nitems  before  the  House for  approval  shows  its\r\n\r\neagerness  to have radio and television  propaganda\r\n\r\nbefore 31st August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know how important it was for the\r\n\r\nJapanese  during  the Japanese  occupation  not  to\r\n\r\nallow  local people to be able to time in to short-wave broadcasts. We were only allowed to time in on\r\n\r\nthe medium-wave band. It is recognised all over the\r\n\r\nworld by both power blocs that radio propaganda  is\r\n\r\nso  important  that  even  without  sending  forces\r\n\r\nacross  the  seas, they can capture the territories\r\n\r\nthey want by subversion in that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I was in Jesselton and in Kuching, there\r\n\r\nwas  fear  expressed by the people there  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  poison  in  Singapore.  This  was  due  to   a\r\n\r\nstatement by the P.A.P., who said that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nwere  open-front Communists. They said,  \"They  say\r\n\r\nso. If there are open-front\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunists, what about those who are not open-front\r\n\r\nCommunists?\" The Finance Minister in his  financial\r\n\r\nstatement  has referred to the last  ten  years  as\r\n\r\nbeing  years of strife. Sir, that period  coincides\r\n\r\nwith  the period of the establishment of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. If propaganda is broadcast on  short\r\n\r\nwave to our neighbours who are going to be partners\r\n\r\nin  Malaysia  and they are already  scared  of  the\r\n\r\npoison from Singapore, the earlier installation  of\r\n\r\nall  this machinery will simply mean the chance  of\r\n\r\nmore  propaganda for the P.A.P. throughout Malaysia\r\n\r\ndisturbing the climate in other territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, the P.A.P. may say that they have\r\n\r\nchanged, but we have not yet seen the change to  be\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  bit above the surface.  We  are  not\r\n\r\nconvinced  of that yet. Already we see a strike  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today  affecting  the  nurses  and   the\r\n\r\nwelfare of the sick people in the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Ministry of Culture is really anxious\r\n\r\nto preserve the good climate in Borneo and Sarawak,\r\n\r\nthey  could very well refrain from trying to extend\r\n\r\nthe  scope of their propaganda machinery till after\r\n\r\n31st August, when people can say there will be fair\r\n\r\nplay  for  all.  At this particular Time  President\r\n\r\nSoekarno  and  the  Tunku have decided  that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be a policy of co-operation and not one  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation.  The P.A.P. have said  they  believe\r\n\r\ndefinitely in open confrontation. I can foresee, in\r\n\r\nthese   radio   programmes  over   the   short-wave\r\n\r\nbroadcasts,  there  can be such  statements  as  to\r\n\r\ninvite  open  confrontation from other territories,\r\n\r\nthereby  spoiling the atmosphere not  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nbut of Malaysia. If the P.A.P. Government is really\r\n\r\ninterested  in  more co-operation instead  of  more\r\n\r\nconfrontation in Malaysia, they could refrain  from\r\n\r\nspending this sum till after 31st August, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe have heard the three Ministers of the Government\r\n\r\nreferring to me as the Member for Yio Chu  Kang.

His reply clearly shows that it is when the P.A.P. is unable to explain its abuse of the Government machinery that it will bring out the weapon of the so-called united front of the Communists. All this so-called united front of\r\n\r\nCommunists is a claim made by the P.A.P. in  order\r\n\r\nto  shirk  its  responsibility and to  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople.  It  is  claimed by  the  P.A.P. that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis has infiltrated into  the  unions\r\n\r\nand  led  strikes, and so it is necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to expand the services of  broadcasting\r\n\r\nin order to pin down the Barisan's infiltration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the past few days we have seen that if the argument of the Minister for Culture can stand, then it means that the Communists have already infiltrated into the Ministry of Home Affairs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen employees of the Ministry of Home Affairs on strike. The pickets perform their duties outside the C.I.D., on the doorsteps of the Special Branch, outside the Central Police Station and even outside the Ministry of Home Affairs itself. On all these\r\n\r\nbuildings  we can see banners and strike  placards.\r\n\r\nThe   slogan  is  that  the  strikers  condemn  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   for  using  the  Police  against   the\r\n\r\nlegitimate strikers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are even a lot of cartoons on display, and one of the cartoons says, \"Small men, small pay.

In fact, the Government intends to make use of the radio to achieve its political propaganda and it is actually\r\n\r\nimpractical. They are unable to do this because the\r\n\r\nfuture general election will show where they stand.\r\n\r\nAs  a  matter of fact, the naive arguments  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture over Radio Singapore will  not\r\n\r\nbe  able to deceive the people. If he thinks so,  I\r\n\r\nsay  it is a mistaken conception. We all know  that\r\n\r\nthe  Voice  of America has a very great voice.  Its\r\n\r\ntransmission  is very strong, but the  strength  of\r\n\r\nthe U.S.A. imperialists is decreasing from Time  to\r\n\r\nTime.  All  that we are concerned now is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should not be allowed to  abuse  public\r\n\r\nfunds   on   an   insignificant   and   unnecessary\r\n\r\nexpansion. So if the Government wants to  show  the\r\n\r\nworld  that it is interested in the welfare of  the\r\n\r\npeople, then it must make use of this money that is\r\n\r\nbeing  asked  for,  for  the  improvement  of   the\r\n\r\nlivelihood of the people and not for the  expansion\r\n\r\nof this short-wave service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Tanglin takes\r\n\r\nobjection, as far as I can gather, to the extension\r\n\r\nof the short-wave service on two grounds. First, be\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  under a misapprehension  that  Radio\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  for party propaganda.  He  has  been\r\n\r\nsaying  that for the last three years.  There  must\r\n\r\nhave been many instances over the past three years.\r\n\r\nI  have asked him Time and again if he could  quote\r\n\r\nany  instance where party propaganda,  as  distinct\r\n\r\nfrom  government  propaganda, has gone  across  the\r\n\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he says he went to Jesselton and saw\r\n\r\nsome people - I do not know which people he saw  -\r\n\r\nwho said that they are afraid of the poison that is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be spread from Singapore to  the  Borneo\r\n\r\nterritories. Obviously, Sir, this \"poison\" is  meat\r\n\r\nto  many  people in Jesselton, because we have  had\r\n\r\nfrom  the Political Study Centre-which has also  in\r\n\r\nthe  past been accused of being a P.A.P. propaganda\r\n\r\noutfit  -  enquiries from certain people  who  came\r\n\r\nfrom the Borneo territories and the Federation to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattend  our  Political Study Centre,  who  were  so\r\n\r\nimpressed  by  what  was going on  that  they  have\r\n\r\nofficially requested us twice to send our lecturers\r\n\r\nand  speakers  to go and conduct similar  political\r\n\r\nstudy  classes in the Borneo territories. In  fact,\r\n\r\nwe  have  another  request  and  we  have  been  so\r\n\r\nsuccessful that they have asked us to go across and\r\n\r\ntell   their   civil  servants  of  the   political\r\n\r\nbackground to the big struggle that is going on  in\r\n\r\nthis  area.  I cannot therefore see that  what  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. says  over  the radio or at  the  Political\r\n\r\nStudy  Centre  could possibly be called  poison  by\r\n\r\npeople  who  matter. I do not  know  who  were  the\r\n\r\npeople   whom  the  Member  for  Tanglin   met   in\r\n\r\nJesselton. Obviously, they could not be people  who\r\n\r\nmattered.

I am saying that the Member for Tanglin saw\r\n\r\nsome  people, and as it was a short visit he  could\r\n\r\nhave  seen  only two or three people. It  is  quite\r\n\r\npossible  that those people do not matter in  terms\r\n\r\nof what the people of Borneo or Jesselton want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, if what goes over Radio Singapore\r\n\r\ncan be considered as poison, the radio stations  in\r\n\r\nthese three territories would not have asked for an\r\n\r\nexchange  of  programmes, especially  many  of  the\r\n\r\nprogrammes   in   regard  to   political   matters.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  Sir,  what  we  are  trying  to  do  by\r\n\r\nestablishing a short-wave service is to ensure that\r\n\r\ninstead of recording programmes on tape and sending\r\n\r\nthem there weeks late, with the establishment of  a\r\n\r\nshort-wave service people in the Borneo territories\r\n\r\ncan  listen  in  to the same radio  programmes  and\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  same  radio  diet  as  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his other point, whether this\r\n\r\nexpansion  could  not  be  held  back  until  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia, it is our duty not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto halt everything, even necessary extensions, just\r\n\r\nbecause  of  Malaysia. We have to go  on  with  the\r\n\r\nnormal extension of our service, not only for radio\r\n\r\nbut  also  other services. Nor can we say  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  stop  building  a  few  more  post  offices\r\n\r\nbecause we should wait till after Malaysia for  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government to decide whether to build those\r\n\r\npost  offices or extend the airport. It is our duty\r\n\r\nto  carry on doing what is necessary, regardless of\r\n\r\nwhat  happens after Malaysia. That is the basis  on\r\n\r\nwhich  we  plan  to extend this short-wave  service\r\n\r\nbecause it is necessary and not because we want  to\r\n\r\nspread  poison.  It  is  ridiculous  to  say  that,\r\n\r\nbecause  far  from receiving poison the  people  of\r\n\r\nBorneo  want to listen in to many of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  such as some of the radio forums.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Queenstown  has  excited  considerable\r\n\r\ninterest in the Borneo territories and many of them\r\n\r\nregretted  that they were not privileged to  listen\r\n\r\nin  to the fiasco that the Member for Queenstown is\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  have experienced at  a  recent  radio\r\n\r\nforum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a reference to T.V. in the latest issue\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan  from which  I  shall  quote  some\r\n\r\nrelevant extracts when we conic to deal with T.V.

And now with  this  short-wave\r\n\r\nservice, they will have direct experience  of  what\r\n\r\nthe Member for Queenstown and his ghost-writers are\r\n\r\ncapable of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture  should really he called the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Propaganda.

Sir,   I   met\r\n\r\nresponsible  leaders  of the political  Parties  in\r\n\r\nNorth  Borneo, and they explained to me the  reason\r\n\r\nwhy  they  insisted on controlling  immigration  in\r\n\r\ntheir  territory.

The\r\n\r\nevidence  was  this: that the News Room  under  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Front  Government - then  they  metamorphosed\r\n\r\ninto   the  S.P.A.,  and  I  think  now  they  call\r\n\r\nthemselves  the Grand Alliance. But  his  claim  is\r\n\r\nthat before, under their regime, the News Room  was\r\n\r\nelsewhere, and that with the present Government the\r\n\r\nNews  Room is in the City Hall. The News  Room  has\r\n\r\nalways been in City Hall, so I do not see how  that\r\n\r\nconstitutes party propaganda over Radio Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards his speech. I cannot recollect it.\r\n\r\nNormally   we   never  interfere  with   the   news\r\n\r\npresentation and he can challenge it. He can ask of\r\n\r\nany News\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEditor. The only thing we are interested in is, how\r\n\r\nshould the news be relayed? Normally what the  News\r\n\r\nEditor  does is he has got only two, three or  four\r\n\r\nminutes.  He  uses his judgment and  cuts  out  the\r\n\r\nleast  impressive of the speeches. It may  be  that\r\n\r\nwhen  he  first read out the report of the Member's\r\n\r\nspeech  unedited, which as he said came  to  a  few\r\n\r\nparagraphs,  and it was discovered  that  the  Time\r\n\r\nlimit  at  his  disposal  was  only  two  or  three\r\n\r\nminutes,  he went through it with a red pencil  and\r\n\r\ndecided to delete it. It is a normal process  which\r\n\r\ngoes on in every newspaper office. So that does not\r\n\r\nconstitute proof that'd there is P.A.P. propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the two points I wish to make,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Member and other  Members  have  been\r\n\r\nsaying  that  we  broadcast  party  propaganda.  We\r\n\r\nalways challenge them. Please produce instances. If\r\n\r\nthere  were  any  instances during the  past  three\r\n\r\nyears, there must obviously have been a great  deal\r\n\r\nof  party propaganda going across. They should have\r\n\r\nnoted   it   down - \"Such  and  such  a  date,   this\r\n\r\nparticular item or party propaganda was put across.\r\n\r\nPlease,  can you explain?\" Then we will be prepared\r\n\r\nto  explain.  But to make a general statement  that\r\n\r\nthere   is  party  propaganda,  as  distinct   from\r\n\r\ngovernment  propaganda. What  hurts  them  most  is\r\n\r\nthis.  This  Government has achieved a great  deal,\r\n\r\nunlike the previous Government, and therefore has a\r\n\r\nlot  to boast of. Therefore, the more we boast, the\r\n\r\nmore  it  hurts  them. That is the crux  of  `their\r\n\r\ncomplaint that there is P.A.P. propaganda. What  he\r\n\r\nmeans is that by contrast we build houses; we  show\r\n\r\nthem  over  T.V. If they had T.V., they would  have\r\n\r\nnothing  to  show.  If  you  want  to  boast  about\r\n\r\nsomething,  you should boast about something  which\r\n\r\nis  convincing.  Now we have achieved  so  much  of\r\n\r\nwhich  we are proud and we are justified in putting\r\n\r\nit  over  the radio. We have built houses, we  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  schools, we have built roads; we show  them.\r\n\r\nWhen  Members like the Member for Tanglin  look  at\r\n\r\nall  this, it irritates them. It annoys the  Member\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  the  truth. Therefore, he decides  being  a\r\n\r\n\"moral  rearmamenter\"  to  say  that  all  this  is\r\n\r\npropaganda. The houses could not exist, the schools\r\n\r\ncould   not   exist;  therefore   this   is   party\r\n\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will\r\n\r\npardon me, I have to bring up an illustration  that\r\n\r\nI think should be brought up under television.

The   Supervisor  of  the  Referendum   was\r\n\r\nannouncing  the result. There has been a  tradition\r\n\r\nthat such announcements are made publicly over  the\r\n\r\nloudspeaker to the people, because they  voted  for\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we went through the same process after\r\n\r\nthe  referendum. Surely if the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin - I  do  not know if he was there, I did not see  him\r\n\r\nafter  the result - he could have hobnobbed with  the\r\n\r\nmasses   and  listened  together  with  them,   and\r\n\r\nrejoiced over the result together with them. It has\r\n\r\nbeen  the  custom  always  for  the  Supervisor  of\r\n\r\nElections  to  make the announcement publicly,  and\r\n\r\nnot whisper it privately to a few friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, regarding some films over T.V. There was no\r\n\r\nT.V. then. T.V. started on 15th February. I do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether he is mentioning some other instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the display of flags, we made a film,\r\n\r\nand  there  were  occasions during  the  referendum\r\n\r\nstruggle when there were rallies for the Tunku.  We\r\n\r\ntook  a  lot  of  pictures - some  where  the  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nbrought banners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> They were not shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> They were shown, and if the Member\r\n\r\nwants, we are prepared to show him. We have sixteen\r\n\r\nBerita Singapura, each lasting about ten to fifteen\r\n\r\nminutes.  There were pictures with lots  of  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nbanners.  In  fact,  there was a  slight  confusion\r\n\r\nbetween S.P.A. and A.U.P.E. banners.

There  was\r\n\r\nnothing  to  prevent  the S.P.A. on  the  day  the\r\n\r\nreferendum results were declared to come  out  with\r\n\r\ntheir  flags and banners and mingle with the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nbanners.  The  Barisan  were  there;  they  brought\r\n\r\nbanners,  but they had to leave hastily before  the\r\n\r\nresults  were  announced.  So  they  now  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity of being filmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore submit, Sir, that the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  has not yet produced tangible evidence  of\r\n\r\nparty propaganda as against government propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The Minister for Culture has\r\n\r\nnot denied that there is such a television film and\r\n\r\nthat it was shown over the television programme.

Here the Government is asking for a vote of $4,460,900 for providing furniture and equipment. According to the explanation given here, the T.V. Pilot Service was inaugurated on 15th February, 1963 and the Regular Service came into\r\n\r\nbeing on 2nd April, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we can see clearly that this House has\r\n\r\napproved  two votes for this expenditure. In  1962,\r\n\r\nthis  House  already approved $3 million  for  T.V.\r\n\r\nexpenses.  On  18th June, 1962 the Government  also\r\n\r\nasked  this House to approve $787,030 as  shown  in\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper No. 11 of 1962. Therefore,  the  two\r\n\r\nvotes  passed previously should be enough  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  use on T.V. services. Fundamentally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  the emphasis should be on educating  the\r\n\r\npeople. The television services should not be  used\r\n\r\nto  mislead  the people or as a means of propaganda\r\n\r\nfor the ruling Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since the 15th o February when the T.V. Pilot Service was inaugurated in Singapore, the Government have installed quite a number of television sets in the community centres. At the last sitting of this House, the Minister in his reply said that the Government had installed 78\r\n\r\nT.V. sets in these community centres. At the  same\r\n\r\ntime, he said that the Government would install the\r\n\r\nsame\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber of T.V. sets from then on in other community\r\n\r\ncentres. But can these T.V. sets bring any  benefit\r\n\r\nto  the  people? We have to examine  this  question\r\n\r\nclosely. It is now four months since the setting up\r\n\r\nof  television  in  Singapore.  During  these  four\r\n\r\nmonths,  many guardians of households have advanced\r\n\r\ntheir  views  on the T.V. services  and  they  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  the errors of the Government,  saying\r\n\r\nthat  the Government have been using T.V. for their\r\n\r\npropaganda purposes for their own Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the T.V. programmes are normally on in the evening from 7 p.m. to about 11 p.m. This period is very important to certain people, especially to the students. As a result of the introduction of T.V., many students waste their valuable Time watching T.V. programmes and do not\r\n\r\nconcentrate  on  their  school  lessons.  This   is\r\n\r\nespecially  so in the community centres where  many\r\n\r\nafternoon  session students do not  go  home  after\r\n\r\nschool.  They  just  loiter  around  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres  waiting  to see T.V. programmes.  Quite  a\r\n\r\ngood  number of parents have complained about  this\r\n\r\nto  us.  They say that because the Government  have\r\n\r\ninstalled T.V. sets in many community centres their\r\n\r\nchildren  have not been returning home in Time  and\r\n\r\nthat   they  have  been  neglecting  their   school\r\n\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we should remember that in the rural areas every family makes full use of its labour force. Some of these students have to help in the farm or look after the poultry after school. But as a result of the Government's installation of T.V. sets in community centres in the rural areas, these students do not return home in Time to help in this\r\n\r\nsort  of  work.  Thus, the family as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nstudents  themselves suffer a great  loss.  We  can\r\n\r\ntherefore  say that the period for T.V. programmes\r\n\r\nis  already long enough, and yet the Government are\r\n\r\ntrying to introduce another channel, a second  T.V.\r\n\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I believe that the Government will be receiving complaints\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  they  will have to think twice about  this  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the students pay attention  to  their\r\n\r\nlessons. Instead of this, the Government are trying\r\n\r\nto  extend  T.V. services. What is the Government's\r\n\r\nintention? I think the Government intend to  extend\r\n\r\ntheir  T.V. programmes to the rural areas in  order\r\n\r\nto  propagandise their rallies and meetings with  a\r\n\r\nview  to  the  next general election. But  whatever\r\n\r\nthey  do,  we  know  that the people  will  not  be\r\n\r\nattracted  to  these  rallies.  That  is  why   the\r\n\r\nGovernment intend to attract and induce the  people\r\n\r\nto come to their rallies and talks by means of T.V.\r\n\r\nprogrammes. The Conservative Party in England  also\r\n\r\nused  this  means  and I believe  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  are also trying to emulate this  tactic\r\n\r\nfor their political publicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Government are wrong in wanting such a great sum of money for T.V. extension. They should not be doing this. The vote asks for $4.46 million plus $3 million voted in 1962 plus $780,000 voted for 1961. Altogether the Government will have $8 million for T.V. purposes. Now this total sum of $8 million is the same amount as the house\r\n\r\nassessment rates in the rural areas for  1961.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  let us see Paper Command 6 of 1963,  page\r\n\r\n81.  Under the heading of Rural Administration, the\r\n\r\nsum  is  about  $8.5 million for  house  assessment\r\n\r\nrates.  The Government are asking $8.2 million  for\r\n\r\nT.V.  Why  can the Government not use this  sum  to\r\n\r\nbuild  more  creches and other social amenities  in\r\n\r\nthe  more crowded areas to give more benefit to the\r\n\r\nworking  population? The Government have  not  been\r\n\r\nlooking  after the livelihood of people in the  low\r\n\r\nincome  groups. They are only interested  in  their\r\n\r\npolitical future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the way in which the Government are squandering the money will not be forgotten by the people in the next elections. The Prime Minister's trips and his speeches here and there and certain American films of low taste are televised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when the P.A.P. came to power, the Minister for Labour inspected various community centres and ordered that all American publications should be confiscated because, according to him, these publications gave American imperialist propaganda and should not be allowed in the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres. But in the T.V. programmes  of\r\n\r\ntoday  the  Government  is  exhibiting  a  lot   of\r\n\r\nAmerican  films and other undesirable  films.  This\r\n\r\ngoes  to  show  that T.V. Singapura  is  unable  to\r\n\r\nprovide  its  own programmes. On the  contrary,  it\r\n\r\nwants to extend the time of T.V. shows and thus  it\r\n\r\nwill  have  to borrow from elsewhere. That  is  why\r\n\r\nquite a great deal of American films have been used\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  T.V. programmes.  This   is   very\r\n\r\ndangerous to the people of Singapore. This practice\r\n\r\nis exactly opposite to what the Minister for Labour\r\n\r\nhas said in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, a little while ago when discussing the question of Radio Singapore. I said that the Government should spend more time on social welfare and not on their struggle for their own future political life. Dr Thio Chan Bee: Mr Speaker, Sir, the sum of\r\n\r\nalmost  $4\ufffd million is a very big sum to  spend  on\r\n\r\nextension of television services at this Time. From\r\n\r\nthose  who have been watching television programmes\r\n\r\nthere  have  been  complaints that the  Government,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  spending more money on quality  films,\r\n\r\nare  giving very, very old films, and educationally\r\n\r\nthe films especially for the children arc not quite\r\n\r\nsuitable.  I  saw a few of the films on  television\r\n\r\nand  I  must  say  that young children  with  their\r\n\r\nimitative faculties highly developed would be  able\r\n\r\nto  follow  the creatures in the cartoons resorting\r\n\r\nto  the use of axes to break down doors anti so  on\r\n\r\nand  to  chase  one  another  with  very  dangerous\r\n\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we know very well that the main purpose\r\n\r\nof  television at this time is propaganda on behalf\r\n\r\nof the P.A.P. We know very well that in the case of\r\n\r\nthe P.A.P., the Government and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are almost identical, because when  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  goes  on his rounds  visiting  the\r\n\r\npeople,  he  is greeted as the Prime Minister,  but\r\n\r\nwhen he talks he attacks other Parties, making  him\r\n\r\nappear  as a Party leader rather than the  national\r\n\r\nleader.  So, how are people to know that the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  appearing  in  television  is  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister or the Party leader, because he acts as if\r\n\r\nhe  is  both  at  one and the same  Time,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Culture  himself  has   indirectly\r\n\r\nadmitted  only  a  few months  ago  that  the  main\r\n\r\npurpose of television is to reduce the influence of\r\n\r\nthe Barisan in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, by implication, that means\r\n\r\nit  is really to put up the stock of the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> If that is the main purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  sense  of this item, I think it is not  proper\r\n\r\nfor  the  Party  in power a: this  Time,  with  the\r\n\r\ngeneral elections probably not far away ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

[Laughter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> --- spent a great deal of Time\r\n\r\narguing that we should not have spent more money on\r\n\r\ntelevision but that we should have no television at\r\n\r\nall  .Sir,  he pointed out the evils of television.\r\n\r\nYoung  people  instead of going  home,  go  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres:  farmers' children  instead  of\r\n\r\nstaying  at home go to the community centres.  But,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Choa Chu Kang knows that  even  in\r\n\r\nCommunist China long treatises are written  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  the advent of television is to keep  up  with\r\n\r\nthe Times, so the people should have the advantage of  the  latest  of\r\n\r\nscientific devices,  which  is television. So,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto that extent, the Barisan Sosialis is not only  a pro-Communist group  but it is outdated. It does not keep in touch with the latest advance in  Communism, because  in  Moscow  and in Peking,  television  is regarded \r\n\r\nas an essential part of the people's life. Therefore,  for the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis now  to  claim that television is no good - and that is what a \r\n\r\ngreat deal  of  the  argument  was  about,  because  some parents are \r\n\r\ncomplaining that their children are not staying in their homes and are \r\n\r\nspending their  time in the community centres, I can tell him that if he\r\n\r\ntries  to say that the Barisan Sosialis would  like the  Government to \r\n\r\ndismantle all T.V. sets  in  all community  centres,  I shall be  prepared\r\n\r\nto  take Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis to any  community centre  to get\r\n\r\nthem to get up and say that  we  are going  to take away the community \r\n\r\nT.V. sets, and  I am  quite sure, Sir, what the answer of the  people would \r\n\r\nbe. The Barisan Sosialis would probably  have to go to Jakarta to seek \r\n\r\nrefuge. Sir, this is quite simple. Just like radio, T.V. is one more weapon \r\n\r\nto expose the falsehoods of the Communists. They  keep on  saying - they have\r\n\r\nbeen saying for the  last  two years  - that the P.A.P. is exploiting \r\n\r\nthe people and has  done  nothing  for the people,  has  not  done anything \r\n\r\nto improve the welfare of the people.  But what  is happening since T.V.\r\n\r\ncame? The people  arc seeing  houses. They see them visually and the  lie of \r\n\r\nthe  Communist propaganda that a  non-Communist Government  cannot  do \r\n\r\nthings  for  them  has  been exposed.  They  say there arc no clinics. \r\n\r\nWe  show clinics  being  opened.  They  say  there  are   no schools.\r\n\r\nWe show schools being opened. People  see that  in  community centres \r\n\r\nin the rural areas  for the  first  Time  on TV. People  are  beginning \r\n\r\nto realise - visual  evidence, concrete evidence - that unlike what the \r\n\r\nCommunists claim, that only under a Communist  society  can  life  be\r\n\r\nbetter  for  the people,  they now say, yes, in a democratic society it  \r\n\r\nis  possible to create a better  life  for  the people,  and that is the\r\n\r\nmain motivation.  Because, Sir,  when  the project for television was \r\n\r\nstarted while hon. Members were still in the   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  they  were  quite  excited  about  the prospects  of \r\n\r\ntelevision.  But  since  they   left suddenly,  television has become \r\n\r\na  bad  thing,  a dangerous weapon to deceive the people. Why  is  it when \r\n\r\nthe  television project was mooted when  they were  still  in  the \r\n\r\ngovernment,  they  were  most enthusiastic about television? They\r\n\r\nsaw  in  it  a weapon  to educate the people, to teach them.  That\r\n\r\nis  what we are doing now, teaching the people what is happening in \r\n\r\nSingapore. For the first Time, they are beginning to see things which \r\n\r\nwere not possible to convey purely over the radio. So, Sir, I hope it\r\n\r\nwill  be made public that the Barisan Sosialis have now  come to a stag\r\n\r\ne where they will deny  T.V. to the  ordinary people in the community \r\n\r\ncentres  who cannot  afford  T.V., that they are  now  demanding that\r\n\r\nthe Government should withdraw television sets because it is a waste of \r\n\r\nTime and it is not fit for ordinary people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Minister give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Sir, as far as I understand my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the Member for Choa Chu  Kang,  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that the contents of television are no  good.\r\n\r\nIt is not television itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. If the Member for Choa Chu\r\n\r\nKang  had  been misrepresented, I am sure he  would\r\n\r\nhave  got up to say how he had been misrepresented.\r\n\r\nMr Rajaratnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have got my notes here saying\r\n\r\nthat  farmers are complaining that their  children,\r\n\r\ninstead  of helping them in their houses at  night,\r\n\r\nare spending Time in the community centres watching\r\n\r\ntelevision. Obviously, therefore, the Barisan  line\r\n\r\nis   that  children  of  farmers  are  not  to  see\r\n\r\ntelevision. I hope this is a line that the  Barisan\r\n\r\nis  taking, that they have come to a  point  where\r\n\r\nthey have now to argue that television is all right\r\n\r\nfor doctors who can afford\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelevision. Their children can see television,  but\r\n\r\nas  regards children of farmers, the Government  is\r\n\r\nwasting  money  providing a television  service  in\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again he says that the television programmes\r\n\r\nfall  far short of expectations. We have only  been\r\n\r\nfour  months on television. People are trying hard.\r\n\r\nWe  are  short of money and some of the  programmes\r\n\r\nare not up to standard. But it is not quite true to\r\n\r\nsay, as the Barisan Sosialis has just claimed, that\r\n\r\nwe  show  only American films. It is true  we  show\r\n\r\nAmerican  films,  but we also show  Chinese  films,\r\n\r\nIndians films, Indonesian films, Malay films, Malay\r\n\r\nprogrammes. It is difficult to get Malay films,  so\r\n\r\nwe spent more money putting forward live programmes\r\n\r\nwhich  cost  six  or  seven  Times  as  much,  even\r\n\r\nsometimes  ten  Times as much  as  getting  feature\r\n\r\nfilms on hire -  old films - but again I have said that\r\n\r\nwe hope that as our people become more experienced,\r\n\r\nthey will be able to produce better programmes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Sir, that even the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nafter  making all this denunciation of  television,\r\n\r\nfind  it  convenient from Time to Time to refer  to\r\n\r\ntelevision?  Recently, we had  a  T.V. forum.  The\r\n\r\nleader  of the Barisan Sosialis came to the  forum.\r\n\r\nIf  he thought it was an instrument of reaction,  a\r\n\r\nwaste of Time, a waste of public money, why did  he\r\n\r\ncome  up  to  the television forum? And the  latest\r\n\r\nissue  of the Barisan referred with great pride  to\r\n\r\nwhat  happened  at the T.V. forum.  They  used  the\r\n\r\nprogramme  as  an argument in their favour - \"It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  noted that three M.P.s in the T.V. forum have\r\n\r\nsimilarly suggested that Malaysia had been rushed.\"\r\n\r\nSo,  Sir, when television suits their ends,  it  is\r\n\r\ngood  television; but if it does not, then  let  us\r\n\r\ndeprive  the  people  of television.  That  is  the\r\n\r\napproach.  We  are  quite frank about  our  use  of\r\n\r\ntelevision. We use television, we use the radio, we\r\n\r\nuse  all  means of propaganda to defeat and  expose\r\n\r\nthe Communists; and this is a powerful weapon. As I\r\n\r\nhave  said before, Sir, we will continue to use  it\r\n\r\nto  conscribe and defeat the Communists as we  have\r\n\r\ndone in the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with reference to the Member for Tanglin, I\r\n\r\nam  not  quite sure what he said. After  regretting\r\n\r\nthat  we have spent $4 million, he went on  to  say\r\n\r\nthat  we should spend more money on quality  films.\r\n\r\nIf,  on  the  one hand, he believes that television\r\n\r\nshould  be improved by using better films, I  quite\r\n\r\nagree with him. We hope there will come a Time when\r\n\r\nwith  the  introduction  of  commercial  television\r\n\r\nthere will be enough money for us to buy newer  and\r\n\r\nbetter films and produce our own films. But this is\r\n\r\na  normal  part  of  our  expansion  of  television\r\n\r\nservice.  As  you  know,  the  television   service\r\n\r\noriginally  started off as a one and  a  half  hour\r\n\r\nservice.  Since  then, far from  what  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  have to say. I have lots of letters  from\r\n\r\npeople  saying that they want more Time.  They  say\r\n\r\nthat  three hours are not enough. The Chinese  want\r\n\r\nmore  programmes; the Indians want more programmes;\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  want more programmes and the  English-educated  want more time. Therefore, the  expansion\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been foreseen is now taking place,  far\r\n\r\nsooner than we expected. So this money is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  expansion takes place as rapidly as possible;\r\n\r\nand  I am quite sure the Member for Tanglin did not\r\n\r\nreally  mean  what  time said  when  he  said  that\r\n\r\ncartoons  had a bad effect on children. I am  quite\r\n\r\nsure  in  his school he must have provided  Grimms'\r\n\r\nFairy  Tales to school boys. There are more horrors\r\n\r\nin  a  Grimms' fairy tale than in one of our modern\r\n\r\ncartoons, because modern children are bright enough\r\n\r\nto  be  able  to  distinguish between  fantasy  and\r\n\r\nreality,  and  I  am quite sure that  none  of  the\r\n\r\ncartoons  really  have  an  adverse  influence   on\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nthink  I want to waste too much Time because  there\r\n\r\nis  a very important motion coming after this.  But\r\n\r\nrealising. Sir, that it is no use arguing too  much\r\n\r\nand too long with the Government side when they are\r\n\r\ndetermined to run the thing through, I want to  say\r\n\r\nthis. If the Government had spent with as much\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsense  of  urgency the huge sums of money to  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  water shortage, there would have been no water\r\n\r\nshortage, but when it comes to election propaganda,\r\n\r\nmoney is available and it must be spent quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\na  while  ago, I pointed out to the House that  the\r\n\r\npresent  T.V. service is more than sufficient  and\r\n\r\nthat there is no necessity for further expansion of\r\n\r\nthe T.V. service, but the Minister for Culture said\r\n\r\nthat we are opposing all the T.V. services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have pointed out, another point is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment make use of T.V. for political purposes.\r\n\r\nOn  28th  June, 1962, when this House was  debating\r\n\r\nthe  First  Supplementary Development Estimates,  I\r\n\r\nasked the Acting Minister for Culture, that is  the\r\n\r\npresent Minister fur Finance, to assure this  House\r\n\r\nthat  the  T.V. service should not be used  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. as a sort of political propaganda.  I  also\r\n\r\npointed  out  on  that  occasion  that  the  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Culture  should  give  us  such   an\r\n\r\nassurance, but he did not and dared not  give  such\r\n\r\nan  assurance. Therefore, this clearly  shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. are only interested in their  political\r\n\r\npropaganda  and not in educating and informing  the\r\n\r\npeople  but  only  in their political  future.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  feel that the present T.V. service  is\r\n\r\nnot  sufficient, and therefore they have asked  for\r\n\r\nanother $4 million approximately to expand it. This\r\n\r\nwill be a great loss to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister said just now that when I was in the P.A.P. I said that T.V. was a good thing and that it should be started. This is wrong. When we left the P.A.P., the Prime Minister saw me and the Member for Upper Serangoon and we talked for more than three hours in his office. At that\r\n\r\nTime, the Prime Minister said that all the measures\r\n\r\nand  policies can be put to the people through  TV.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister then requested us to give  very\r\n\r\ncareful consideration to this problem. However,  we\r\n\r\ntold  him  that propaganda through T.V. could  not\r\n\r\ndeceive the people, that it would only increase the\r\n\r\nmisery and hardship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the people and that therefore this would be\r\n\r\na waste of public funds. If the Prime Minister were\r\n\r\nhere,  I hope he would rise up and confirm this  if\r\n\r\nhe has the courage to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as responsible representatives of the people, we have a duty to keep a check on the actions of the Government, so that money derived from the people will be spent for the benefit of the people and not for the benefit of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not\r\n\r\nreally  intend to get involved in this debate,  but\r\n\r\nsince  my  name has been used in vain,  I  think  I\r\n\r\nshould say a few words of clarification. The Member\r\n\r\nfor  Choa  Chu  Kang  said  that  he  asked  for  a\r\n\r\nguarantee which I dared not give. The guarantee  he\r\n\r\nasked for was mat T.V. should not be used for party\r\n\r\npropaganda. Sir, it is just like asking  a  man  to\r\n\r\nguarantee not to beat his wife with a big stick. It\r\n\r\nis  obviously  an  irrelevant and  loaded  sort  of\r\n\r\nguarantee  and I treated it with the contempt  that\r\n\r\nit   deserved.  My  colleague,  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nCulture,  has repeatedly said that if  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis or the Member for Tanglin has any concrete\r\n\r\nexample that any particular programme is being used\r\n\r\nfor P.A.P. party propaganda, please let us know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Will you appoint a Commission?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am really surprised to\r\n\r\nlearn  that  the Party appointed the Commission.

He said that he talked to the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  during the break, not before  the  break.\r\n\r\nLong  before  that, the Government had  decided  to\r\n\r\nlaunch into T.V. and there was no dissenting  voice\r\n\r\nthen.  It was during the break that he went to  see\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister to say that propaganda  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  used  to deceive the people. That  is  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis type of propaganda. Our propaganda\r\n\r\nis  used  to  expose those people who  deceive  the\r\n\r\npeople as well as to educate the people and that is\r\n\r\nthe crux of the problem.

In our present Constitution, defence services and foreign affairs are the responsibilities of the United Kingdom and therefore we, the people of Singapore, should not shoulder these responsibilities. The Members of\r\n\r\nthis   House   are   elected  according   to   this\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Before our present position  alters,\r\n\r\nwe  should not incur any expenditure to expand this\r\n\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year on 28th June, we had a very heated\r\n\r\ndebate  in  this  House  on  the  question  of  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  the Second Battalion,  Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry Regiment. On that occasion, the Government\r\n\r\nasked  for $2 million for the establishment of  the\r\n\r\nSecond Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment,  and\r\n\r\nthat Development Estimate was approved in spite  of\r\n\r\nour  strong  opposition. Today, the Government  are\r\n\r\nasking  for  $3.8 million for the same purpose.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government are going to use this sum of  money\r\n\r\non  other development projects, then we welcome it.\r\n\r\nBut the Government are now going to use this sum of\r\n\r\nmoney   for   the  establishment  of   the   Second\r\n\r\nBattalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the P.A.P. came to power, among all the\r\n\r\npledges they made during the election, they had not\r\n\r\npointed out that they were going to use this sum of\r\n\r\nmoney   on   the  establishment  of   this   Second\r\n\r\nBattalion.  At that Time, they promised the  people\r\n\r\nthat  they  wanted  to  use all  the  resources  to\r\n\r\nimprove   the  living  standards  of  the   people.\r\n\r\nHowever, not only do the Government now not  intend\r\n\r\nto  carry  out their pledges, but, on the contrary,\r\n\r\nthey are going to do all sorts of things which they\r\n\r\ndid  not  promise the people during the  elections.\r\n\r\nThe request for provision for this Second Battalion\r\n\r\nis   a  very  clear  example  of  the  Government's\r\n\r\nintention.  The Labour Ministry has  published  two\r\n\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe  first  one  calls on the people  to  join  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Force;  the second calls on the  people  to\r\n\r\njoin  the Singapore Infantry Regiment. It looks  as\r\n\r\nif  the  P.A.P.'s industrialisation scheme has  now\r\n\r\nbeen  turned  into  a scheme for expansion  of  the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces.  The Labour Exchange of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  have not told the people what  employment\r\n\r\nthey  have given them. Instead they have asked them\r\n\r\nto join the Police and the Armed Forces. Singapore\r\n\r\nis a small island with only 1.6 million population.\r\n\r\nIs  it  really necessary that we should expand  the\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces?  At present the U.K. Government  has\r\n\r\nstationed  a  lot  of  troops  in  all   parts   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The  Prime Minister last  Friday,  when\r\n\r\nreplying  to  the Member for Upper Serangoon,  also\r\n\r\npointed   out  that  the  British  Government   has\r\n\r\noccupied  13,000  acres of  land  for  their  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.  Apart from the British forces,  there  are\r\n\r\nalso  Federation troops in Singapore. Last  Friday,\r\n\r\nthe   Minister   for  National  Development,   when\r\n\r\nreplying to the Member for Changi, pointed out that\r\n\r\nthere were 1,380 units of houses which are occupied\r\n\r\nby the Federation troops. Therefore, in addition to\r\n\r\nthe  British  troops  in Singapore,  we  also  have\r\n\r\nFederation troops stationed in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these troops, we also have local\r\n\r\ntroops - the  First  Battalion,  Singapore   Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment, established on 11th March, 1957,  by  the\r\n\r\nthen  Labour Front Government, which was  an  anti-people,  anti-worker, reactionary  Government.  The\r\n\r\npurpose  of  forming  this Regiment  was  to  fight\r\n\r\nagainst  the  people in Singapore. But the  P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwhich  professes to be an anti-colonial Government,\r\n\r\nnot only does not disband the First Battalion, but,\r\n\r\non  the  contrary, is doing all it can to establish\r\n\r\nanother Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very good political lesson to the people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. We have seen that the P.A.P. has  no\r\n\r\nintention whatsoever to improve the people's living\r\n\r\nstandards.  They  are now building their  political\r\n\r\nfuture on the strength of the Armed Forces so as to\r\n\r\nmaintain  themselves in power. Can we say that  the\r\n\r\nLoops at present in Singapore are not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsufficient? In fact, Singapore has become a  police\r\n\r\nState  and a military State. Hence we can find  the\r\n\r\nreason   for  the  establishment  of  this   Second\r\n\r\nBattalion  by  the  Government. In  The  past  they\r\n\r\nrelied on the people's strength, but now they  have\r\n\r\nforsaken  the  people and lost the support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Their  very survival now  depends  on  the\r\n\r\nPolice   and  troops.  The  Government  have   also\r\n\r\nanticipated  that  the  people  will  resent  them,\r\n\r\nbecause   they  have  suffered  enough,   and   the\r\n\r\nresentment  and dissatisfaction of the people  have\r\n\r\nalso   increased   day  by  day.   Therefore,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in order to suppress the discontent  of\r\n\r\nthe people and to shore up the British position  in\r\n\r\nthis  area,  have found it necessary  to  establish\r\n\r\nthis Second Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We the people of Singapore should not incur this\r\n\r\nextra  expenditure. If this amount  of  money  came\r\n\r\nfrom  their  own pockets, we still want to  object.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this big sum of money has to be  paid  by\r\n\r\nthe people, and that is all the more reason why  we\r\n\r\nshould object to this request. This sum of money is\r\n\r\nnot  used  to  protect the people but  to  maintain\r\n\r\ntroops  who will be used to suppress the people.  I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  whether, apart from  expanding  this\r\n\r\nBattalion, the Government have the intention to set\r\n\r\nup  a Third Battalion. Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not  allow  the Government  to  increase  the\r\n\r\ntroops   to  suppress  the  people.  The   revenues\r\n\r\ncollected from the people should be spent on  their\r\n\r\nwelfare.  Now,  the Government is asking  for  $3.8\r\n\r\nmillion,   which  is  equivalent  to  the   revenue\r\n\r\ncollected  from radio licences and vehicle  driving\r\n\r\nlicences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Tanglin pointed out to\r\n\r\nthis House that when the people asked for money  to\r\n\r\nbe  used on development which is beneficial to  the\r\n\r\npeople,  the  Government replied  that  it  had  no\r\n\r\nmoney. But now the Government are asking for a  big\r\n\r\nsum  of  money  to support British imperialism  and\r\n\r\ncolonialism, and they are willing to be the running\r\n\r\ndogs  of  British imperialism. They are willing  to\r\n\r\nsee the people suffer, and to see that there are no\r\n\r\nopponents.   The  establishment   of   the   Second\r\n\r\nBattalion only shows that the people will have more\r\n\r\nmisery and hardships in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfuture  and  that they will be suppressed  by  this\r\n\r\nmilitary unit. We, the people of Singapore, must be\r\n\r\nunited   to   condemn  the  Government   for   this\r\n\r\nirresponsible  action  in establishing  the  Second\r\n\r\nBattalion,  Singapore  Infantry  Regiment.  If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are sincere in caring for  the  people,\r\n\r\nthen  we ask them to make use of this sum of  money\r\n\r\non  social  relief, because this sum of money  will\r\n\r\ndouble  the amount at present available for  public\r\n\r\nassistance  and other social welfare  purposes.  If\r\n\r\nthe  Government  are going to set  up  this  Second\r\n\r\nBattalion by hook or by crook, then the P.A.P. will\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to avoid their responsibility in  the\r\n\r\nfuture  and  the  consequences  arising  from  this\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang\r\n\r\nwhether he thinks that the defence of a country and\r\n\r\nits  internal  security  should  be  handed  to   a\r\n\r\ncolonial ruler. Perhaps he did not have the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman (Mr Mammen): If the Member for Choa\r\n\r\nChu Kang wants to reply, he will reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, from what the Member for Choa Chu Kang has\r\n\r\ncriticised about this vote, we can only come to one\r\n\r\nconclusion.  That  is, he is of  the  opinion  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's defence and internal security should be\r\n\r\nthe responsibility of the British colonialists, and\r\n\r\nnot  that  of  the people through their  own  Armed\r\n\r\nForces.  Because, according to him, there are  many\r\n\r\nBritish troops in Singapore, therefore, there is no\r\n\r\nnecessity to expand this Battalion of the  Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment,  and  there is no necessity  for  such  a\r\n\r\nlarge  sum of money to be spent on it. His argument\r\n\r\nis  that  we should leave our defence and  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity in the hands of the British troops. He  is\r\n\r\nin fact speaking like a colonialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, no nationalist with any self- respect, will allow his own county and its defence to be in the hands of a colonial government. The Singapore Government has been elected\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  people themselves. The Battalion  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  established comprise the citizens themselves.\r\n\r\nThe  aim  of this infantry Regiment is to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of internal security in our own\r\n\r\nState.  It  is  necessary for  us  to  expand  this\r\n\r\nInfantry  Regiment,  because  after  the  31st   of\r\n\r\nAugust,   1963,   Singapore  will   have   achieved\r\n\r\nindependence  through merger and Malaysia,  thereby\r\n\r\nbecoming a part of an independent nation. As I have\r\n\r\nalready  pointed  out,  no nation  with  any  self-respect  will ever allow its internal security  and\r\n\r\ndefence  to be in the hands of any foreign country.\r\n\r\nSo  it  is necessary for us at the present juncture\r\n\r\nto expedite the expansion of the Infantry Regiment,\r\n\r\nso that by the 31st of August, we will have our own\r\n\r\ntroops  to shoulder the responsibility of  defence.\r\n\r\nAs  a matter of fact, the question of whether there\r\n\r\nis  a  necessity for this Battalion arose last year\r\n\r\nwhen  we  were debating the Supplementary Estimates\r\n\r\non  the Second Battalion. But for the fact that the\r\n\r\nMember for Choa Chu Kang has seen fit to raise  the\r\n\r\nquestion  again,  there is, in  fact,  no  need  to\r\n\r\nrepeat  the  arguments in reply  to  the  criticism\r\n\r\nraised  at that Time and repeated now by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Choa Chu Kang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the Labour Ministry has published two\r\n\r\nbooklets  calling upon the people of  Singapore  to\r\n\r\njoin  the  army and the police. What is wrong  with\r\n\r\nthat?  Any independent nation should have  its  own\r\n\r\nPolice  Force and Armed Forces. Is the  Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu Kang suggesting that the Police Force  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should be manned by foreigners?  Does  he\r\n\r\nalso mean that the Armed Forces of Singapore should\r\n\r\nbe  manned by foreigners as well, entirely  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of a foreign nation? Does he also go a  step\r\n\r\nfurther to mean that we should leave the protection\r\n\r\nof  the  lives and properties of our people in  the\r\n\r\nhands of a foreign nation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that the intention of the Second\r\n\r\nBattalion is to suppress the \"people\". I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask him for a definition of \"people\". According\r\n\r\nto  what  I understand, the word \"people\",  in  the\r\n\r\ndictionary of the Barisan Sosialis, refers  to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists   and  those  elements  which   are   in\r\n\r\ncollusion with foreign Communist forces. So in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neyes  of  these \"people\", the Armed Forces and  the\r\n\r\nPolice  would  be used to suppress  the  people  as\r\n\r\nindicated  in their own definition. The Member  for\r\n\r\nChoa  Chu  Kang says that the amount we are  asking\r\n\r\nfor  should be utilised in building more houses and\r\n\r\nincreasing public assistance. But I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntell  him  this. If the pro-Communist  elements  do\r\n\r\nless   to   instigate  political  strikes,  thereby\r\n\r\nresulting  in the loss of employment for  thousands\r\n\r\nof  people and cause untold misery and suffering to\r\n\r\ntheir  families,  then there will  be  no  need  to\r\n\r\nincrease the amount of public assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, it is our contention that our State should\r\n\r\nhave  no  bases  for  foreign forces,  and  foreign\r\n\r\ncontrol  in a united Malaya. The Minister for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  does not in his speech deny  what  I  have\r\n\r\nalleged in my speech. It is obvious that we can see\r\n\r\nthat  the  First Battalion and the Second Battalion\r\n\r\nhave  their  Commandants  appointed,  not  by   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home Affairs, but by somebody  else.\r\n\r\nAre  they appointed by the Prime Minister? In fact,\r\n\r\nall  these officials and Commandants are not in the\r\n\r\nhands  of  the Minister for Home Affairs.  Can  you\r\n\r\ntell  us  in  whose hands and in whose control  are\r\n\r\nthese  people?  If the Government thinks  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore are in the Armed Forces,  then\r\n\r\nthese  Armed Forces are forces of Singapore people.\r\n\r\nWho are actually controlling these Armed Forces and\r\n\r\nin whose interests are these Armed Forces intended?\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the present Armed Forces are not\r\n\r\nactually  in  the  hands of the people  themselves.\r\n\r\nThey   are   being   controlled  by   the   British\r\n\r\ncolonialists and the British rulers. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Home Affairs is, on the face of it,  a\r\n\r\nMinister  who  appears to have some  powers  within\r\n\r\nhimself,  but  in actual fact, the appointments  of\r\n\r\nthe  Commandants  and other Army Officers  are  not\r\n\r\nwithin his powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the Members of Parliament of the Labour Party of Britain came to Singapore on 17th April and he told the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffairs in the presence of representatives  of  the\r\n\r\nPress  that  if a nation still has its economy  and\r\n\r\nArmed  Forces  in  the hands of a foreign  country,\r\n\r\nthen  that nation is still a neo-colonial  country.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore and Malaya today, can we ask, is there\r\n\r\ntrue  independence? Even in the event of  so-called\r\n\r\nMalaysia, Singapore will still remain in the  hands\r\n\r\nof  the British rulers. The British/ Malayan Treaty\r\n\r\nwill still remain in force to protect the interests\r\n\r\nof the British colonialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the debate on Radio Singapore, the Minister for Culture talked about Communists; so did the Minister for Home Affairs. It was said that because the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\ninstigate  political strikes, it  is  necessary  to\r\n\r\nestablish the Second Battalion. From the  words  of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Home Affairs, we can see  clearly\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  has established  the  Second\r\n\r\nBattalion  in order to suppress legitimate  strikes\r\n\r\nand  the  working  class. In the  struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers,   strikes  are  forced  on   the   workers\r\n\r\nthemselves.  There is no question of Communists  or\r\n\r\nno  Communists.  If  it is a matter  of  Communists\r\n\r\ninciting political strikes, then how are you  going\r\n\r\nto  explain  the strikes that are happening  within\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs itself? Can we ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs what  happens  to  the\r\n\r\nstrike  that  concerns the Special Branch  and  the\r\n\r\nPolice   Force?   Have  all  these   strikes   been\r\n\r\ninstigated by the Communists? It is clear that  the\r\n\r\nworking  class, in order to improve and  raise  its\r\n\r\nliving  standard, will have to resort to the  final\r\n\r\nweapon of strike. But the Government has classified\r\n\r\nstrikes as \"political\" and \"non-political\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strikes that are organised by unions belonging to\r\n\r\nthe  Government are non-political, whereas  strikes\r\n\r\norganised by unions that are not affiliated to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment Party are political. But in the eyes  of\r\n\r\nthe  working people, it is clear what intention the\r\n\r\nGovernment have in the establishment of the  Second\r\n\r\nBattalion.  In fact, the Minister for Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nhimself  has  already indicated the real  intention\r\n\r\nfor the establishment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Second Battalion. So this Committee should\r\n\r\nrefuse to approve this vote that is being asked for\r\n\r\nfor the Second Battalion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   let   me   explain  the   intention   of\r\n\r\nestablishing the Second Battalion. The  purpose  is\r\n\r\nto  suppress  those traitors who try  to  sell  our\r\n\r\ncountry  to  foreigners and  not  to  suppress  the\r\n\r\npeople. We can therefore understand why the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  and  the people who toe  their  line  are\r\n\r\nworried  about this, because they are  serving  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of certain foreign powers. Their  purpose\r\n\r\nis  to  sell  out  our national  interest  and  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  people to these foreign  powers.\r\n\r\nThey   would  like  to  see  Singapore  and  Malaya\r\n\r\ncontrolled by foreign powers. That is why they  are\r\n\r\nworried and are averse to the idea of setting up  a\r\n\r\nSecond Battalion. But the genuine nationalists  and\r\n\r\nthose who are law abiding and loyal to Singapore do\r\n\r\nnot have to worry about the expansion of the police\r\n\r\nor  the  armed services. They do not have to  worry\r\n\r\nabout the consequences of this expansion. They  can\r\n\r\nsleep  well without any worries, but to those  pro-Communist  elements and those who try to  sell  out\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the people of Singapore  to  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Communists, it is, of course,  a  cause\r\n\r\nfor  concern.  The  process  of  suppressing  those\r\n\r\npeople who try to sell out their countries and  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  their  people has  been  carried  out\r\n\r\nperiodically in many neutral Afro-Asian  countries,\r\n\r\nfor instance, in the United Arab Republic, Cambodia\r\n\r\nand  India.  They  have suppressed  those  traitors\r\n\r\namong them who want to sell out their countries.  I\r\n\r\nwould like to tell these people who want to try  to\r\n\r\nsell out our national interest that we will use all\r\n\r\nthe  forces  available in Singapore  to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such people like the Member for Choa Chu Kang,\r\n\r\nwhether  a country is truly independent depends  on\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is in the Communist bloc.  Only  those\r\n\r\ncountries in the Communist bloc are independent and\r\n\r\nthose   outside   the  Communist   bloc   are   not\r\n\r\nindependent  countries.

In  actual\r\n\r\nfact,  he  is  not clear himself. His mind  is  not\r\n\r\nclear  when he clearly states that the independence\r\n\r\nof  a  country  depends on the  fact  that  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry there are no foreign military bases, and in\r\n\r\nthe  field  of  economy  it is  not  controlled  by\r\n\r\nforeign powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, to become a so-called independent Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe   establishment  of  the  so-called  additional\r\n\r\nBattalion  in  a  so-called  independent  Malaysia,\r\n\r\naccording to our view, the intention is to use  the\r\n\r\nmanpower  of  Singapore  to  be  colonial  puppets,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  know  that if the  Minister  for  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  can recognise that an independent  country\r\n\r\nis  one  that  does  not have  military  bases  for\r\n\r\nforeign  powers, then we can say that the expansion\r\n\r\nof  a  further Battalion is necessary, but we would\r\n\r\nlike  to point out that the purpose of this  is  to\r\n\r\nsuppress the people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  cannot agree with what the Member  has\r\n\r\nsaid.

I  was  informed\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  an  average of about  400  persons\r\n\r\nthere.  Sir, we want to remember that they are  not\r\n\r\nprisoners.  They have never been convicted  by  any\r\n\r\ncourt  of law. They are detainees detained by order\r\n\r\nof   the  Minister  on  inadequate  information  to\r\n\r\nconvict  them  in  a court of law,  otherwise  they\r\n\r\nwould be produced in Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in the public interest, on suspicion detains them. And these arc the persons we call gangsters or who are alleged to be gangsters. One thing I want to draw your attention to, Mr Chairman, is that there is no right in law to make these people work, no right whatever; but with a now traditional capacity for intimidation, what in\r\n\r\nChina  is  called persuasion, the P.A.P. makes  it\r\n\r\nplain  to these detainees that if they do not agree\r\n\r\nto work, they do not have to but they will not come\r\n\r\nout of gaol alive. It is very simple. We have power\r\n\r\nto  detain  you for ever and a day,  not  like  the\r\n\r\nJudges  of  this country who can only send  you  to\r\n\r\nprison for life, which means 15 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nWe  have  power to detain you for ever and  a  day.\r\n\r\nEvery  two  years  it  is  renewed.  And  so  these\r\n\r\ndetainees,  under  threat,  which  in  a  different\r\n\r\nclimate  would  constitute  criminal  intimidation,\r\n\r\nvolunteer  to  work,  Mr Chairman,  and  they  are\r\n\r\nworking in the heat of the day  - and I do say  heat,\r\n\r\nSir, of the day. They are working, I understand,  8\r\n\r\nhours  a  day and I accept the assurance I received\r\n\r\nfrom  the Commissioner of Prisons that they do  not\r\n\r\nwork  for  more  than 8 hours at very  hard  manual\r\n\r\nlabour;  and  they get paid, Sir. Do you  know  how\r\n\r\nmuch they get paid?  - 10 cents a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in Japan, as a prisoner of war being\r\n\r\nmade  to  work at the same type of work  and  being\r\n\r\npaid  10 Japanese sen a day which I never received,\r\n\r\nbecause at the end of 10 days they exchanged it for\r\n\r\n10  cigarettes for 1 yen, 1 cigarette  a  day.  But\r\n\r\nhere these people are paid 10 cents a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, there are two things I want to draw your attention to, apart from having drawn attention to the fact that these persons have not been convicted. I know we are on Pulau Senang itself only and I shall limit myself to the issue there, and it is this, that there is a responsibility, where a person is not properly\r\n\r\nconvicted, for us to look after those families whom\r\n\r\nwe  deprive  of their bread winner.  I  think  that\r\n\r\nthere is a duty to maintain them reasonably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a second aspect and it is this, Mr\r\n\r\nChairman;  there is a duty on us to  pay  for  work\r\n\r\naccording to the value of the work, that is to say,\r\n\r\naccording  to  trade union rates. These  people,  I\r\n\r\nrepeat, are not prisoners. These are basic issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter, Mr Chairman - I was received with\r\n\r\nevery courtesy and shown, I believe, all round  the\r\n\r\nisland,  certainly all the places that I wished  to\r\n\r\nsee. But it is rather far away, and possibly it  is\r\n\r\nnot  often visited. I may be wrong in this,  but  I\r\n\r\ncame  away with a very strong impression of an aura\r\n\r\nof   fear  in  all  those  detainees,  an  aura  of\r\n\r\nhelplessness and hopelessness, because they are  so\r\n\r\nutterly  at  the mercy of every minor  official  on\r\n\r\nthat island. Their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelease or their continued detention is at the whim\r\n\r\nof  officials and is no longer subject to law.

I  am\r\n\r\ninformed, Sir, contrary to my fear, that, in  fact,\r\n\r\nthere  is  no cohesion between the different  gangs\r\n\r\nfrom whom these 400 people are alleged to be drawn.\r\n\r\nThat  is  one  matter which I find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  which would like the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nexplain if he can; whether, in fact, bringing these\r\n\r\npeople  in  close propinquity over  a  long  period\r\n\r\nsubject  to not merely superior discipline  of  the\r\n\r\nofficers  from  the prisons but the  discipline  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own groups does not build an esprit de corps\r\n\r\nwhich  could  endanger our peace if  in  fact  they\r\n\r\nare - as I have no doubt some of them are - drawn  from\r\n\r\nsecret society gangs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One final matter, Mr Chairman. It is a dreadfully\r\n\r\nforlorn  spot, this wrongly named island.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  hear  some  public  assurance  that   the\r\n\r\nofficers  in the Prison service, who are  condemned\r\n\r\nto  do  part do their duty on that island,  receive\r\n\r\nsome  recompense in some fashion either by  way  of\r\n\r\nspecial   leave  or  over-time  pay  because,   Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,   they  are  doing  jobs  not  originally\r\n\r\nenvisaged under the Prison service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think, in\r\n\r\nfact,  some  of the points mentioned by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson have already been raised in the form  of\r\n\r\nquestions and I would be repeating the answers if I\r\n\r\nwere to answer him in detail now. But briefly, what\r\n\r\nI  would  like to say is that prior to  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment assuming office, the detainees who  were\r\n\r\ndetained   under   the  Criminal   Law   (Temporary\r\n\r\nProvisions)  Ordinance had, in fact,  no  means  of\r\n\r\nsecuring  their own release, because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nscheme  for  rehabilitating  these  secret  society\r\n\r\nmembers and what the previous Government did was to\r\n\r\nlock  them up in Changi, three to a cell. Now, when\r\n\r\nwe  came  to  power we thought that this  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  was undesirable and that something  should\r\n\r\nbe  done  to rehabilitate these detainees  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  could be returned to society as normal  human\r\n\r\nbeings. Therefore, the Government appointed  an  ad\r\n\r\nhoc committee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  December  1959  to  inquire  into   the\r\n\r\nexisting arrangements for the detention of  persons\r\n\r\nunder   the  Criminal  Law  (Temporary  Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance 1955 and to make recommendations for  any\r\n\r\nmodifications  or  alterations  of   the   existing\r\n\r\narrangements  and also to make recommendations  for\r\n\r\nthe rehabilitation of detainees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of this ad hoc committee was submitted\r\n\r\nin  January  1960,  and I would like  to  draw  the\r\n\r\nattention of the Member for Anson to sections 6 and\r\n\r\n7  of  the  said Report which can be found  in  the\r\n\r\nReport  of  the  Prisons Inquiry Commission,  1960.\r\n\r\nExcept  for  some  minor  modifications  based   on\r\n\r\npractical experience, the Government has, in  fact,\r\n\r\nimplemented  the  scheme for the rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\ncriminal law detainees or better known as the Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang Scheme recommended by this ad hoc committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say that detainees who go to Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang  volunteer to go there and also  voluntarily\r\n\r\nagree  to  work there. The work they  do  at  Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang  is not punitive in any sense but  part  and\r\n\r\nparcel  of  the  whole  rehabilitation  process  of\r\n\r\nteaching   the  detainees  the  normal   acceptable\r\n\r\nstandard  of conduct in society and to  equip  them\r\n\r\nwith the necessary skills for making an honest  and\r\n\r\nproductive livelihood when they are released.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as I can say, it is very much of an\r\n\r\nexperiment, and I think only time can tell  whether\r\n\r\nthe  scheme  is really a success. But judging  from\r\n\r\nthe results since the implementation of the scheme,\r\n\r\nI   would   say  so  far  the  results  have   been\r\n\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson just now mentioned about an\r\n\r\naura of fear in Pulau Senang. I just wish to repeat\r\n\r\nwhat  the Director of Prisons replied to him,  that\r\n\r\nis,  he went, in fact, at the wrong time. When  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson visited Pulau Senang, there was an\r\n\r\nincident  which  happened just a  week  before  his\r\n\r\nvisit  where, I think, a warder or several  warders\r\n\r\nhad been assaulted `by some criminal law detainees,\r\n\r\nand  consequent  upon  that, these  detainees  were\r\n\r\npunished. They might have been sullen as  a  result\r\n\r\nof that. Presumably that might\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  given the impression to the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nthat  there was an aura of fear. But I have  myself\r\n\r\nmade  several visits to Pulau Senang, and I do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  an  aura of fear.  In  fact,  the\r\n\r\ndetainees  were  very pleased to speak  to  me.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  occasionally, they even raised  problems  to\r\n\r\nme. I did not detect any aura of fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the dependants of the detainees, if they\r\n\r\nare in difficulty, they can always go to the Social\r\n\r\nWelfare Department and public assistance is  always\r\n\r\ngiven  to  them.  As  for  the  law  wages  of  the\r\n\r\ndetainees - and  I am sure the Member for  Anson  was\r\n\r\ninformed by the Director of Prisons - it is receiving\r\n\r\nthe  attention  of the Government. In  fact,  their\r\n\r\nwages  have been increased to 30 cents a few months\r\n\r\nago.  I  think, since early this year, their  wages\r\n\r\nhave  been  increased to 30 cents  a  day  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is considering further increases  if  it\r\n\r\ncan afford to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Government do recognise that the officers\r\n\r\nworking  in Pulau Senang are isolated from  society\r\n\r\nand  therefore  merit  some  compensation  for  the\r\n\r\nisolation  that they have to undergo. In fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  gives each officer $3 allowance  a  day\r\n\r\nextra, and in addition to this the Government  also\r\n\r\ngives each officer one day leave per week over  and\r\n\r\nabove  their  normal leave period. In other  words,\r\n\r\neach  officer is entitled to two and  a  half  days\r\n\r\nrest per week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, I am sorry if my little\r\n\r\nspeech  gave  the impression that I was criticising\r\n\r\nthe  concept of Pulau Senang. The fact that  I  did\r\n\r\nnot  praise  it  is  possibly due  to  the  unhappy\r\n\r\ninfection  from P.A.P. traditions of  never  saying\r\n\r\nanything nice about your opponents. The concept  of\r\n\r\nPulau Senang and the experiment of Pulau Senang  is\r\n\r\na  good  one. What I am criticising is that we  are\r\n\r\nusing  persons who have not been convicted  by  any\r\n\r\ncourts  as  slave labour. The Minister having  been\r\n\r\nthere - and   I  know  he  has  been  there - must   be\r\n\r\nimpressed  by  the  very  considerable  assets   in\r\n\r\nbuildings, vegetable gardens, irrigation works  and\r\n\r\nthe provision for water which are being constructed\r\n\r\nby these detainees. And it is my submission, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  that if you make a man work,  \r\n\r\nyou  should pay  him  his  full wages -  what I call trade  union wages,\r\n\r\nor   what   you   might   call   economic wages - deducting therefrom \r\n\r\nthe cost of his  enforced lodging  and the cost of his board. \r\n\r\nThat  would  be fair.  I  am glad to hear that it is 30 cents.  But you  know,  \r\n\r\nMr Speaker, they do not  even  have  a canteen.  \r\n\r\nThey  cannot  order  a  cup  of   coffee. Gangster or no gangster, Sir, if you are trying  to attract  them  \r\n\r\nto  a human way  of  life,  I  would suggest  a proper approach, and \r\n\r\nfrom the  point  of view  of socialists and persons who believe \r\n\r\nin  the trade  union  movement, I resent the suggestion  of using  \r\n\r\npersons detained by executive act  as  slave labour. I resent the \r\n\r\nsuggestion that we can  compel human beings to work at below \r\n\r\neconomic wage and let the Government benefit by it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to see a canteen for these people from\r\n\r\nwhich  they can purchase a few of  the  minor necessities   \r\n\r\nof  life.  I  would   like   to   see opportunities for them \r\n\r\nto receive their families in the  island,  so  that it does \r\n\r\nnot  sound  so  bad, instead of being brought to some prison \r\n\r\nin town for the purpose of their fortnightly meetings.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the concept is a good one: do not let us spoil\r\n\r\nit by being mean. I say that they  should be  paid  in  full \r\n\r\nand I say that they should  have some human amenities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of volunteering, Mr Speaker, the Minister\r\n\r\nwas not completely frank with this  House. Perhaps he would like \r\n\r\nto add that any detainee  who does riot volunteer to go to Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang will  not be  released by this Government. That is a fact.\r\n\r\nIt is  made,  I gather, completely clear to  those  in Changi  \r\n\r\nthat if you want to be released, you  first apply to go to Pulau \r\n\r\nSenang. If you are a very good boy  there for one year or 15 months, \r\n\r\nthen  you  go back to Changi for a short period and then you  \r\n\r\nare released.   These  are  matters  that   have   been officially \r\n\r\nbrought to my attention, and  I  do  not think I am in any way \r\n\r\nmisrepresenting them. Sir, if you say to me, \"You will  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  a  prisoner for the rest of your life, or  else work,\"  \r\n\r\nand  I volunteer to work, need I  add  that that is a curious \r\n\r\nconcept of volunteering which  is peculiar  to  the  P.A.P.? \r\n\r\nBut  one  other  matter, Sir - apart  from this volunteering \r\n\r\naspect  that  the Minister has introduced - is that there are \r\n\r\nsome  who are  not allowed to volunteer. I wonder if I  might \r\n\r\nbe permitted to mention it under this heading. That is,  \r\n\r\nthe non-Malayan citizens have no hope of  over being  released, \r\n\r\nbecause they are  not  allowed  to volunteer for Pulau Senang. \r\n\r\nMr Speaker,  it  is  a very unhappy position we have been reduced \r\n\r\nto, that Government can, at its pleasure, do more  than  our Judges \r\n\r\nand keep a man in prison for longer than his own life Time.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure the Government\r\n\r\nhas the power to detain a person for ever.  I  think there is a \r\n\r\nlimit to the  period  of detention,   I   think,  to   five   \r\n\r\nyears.   Well, nevertheless, I will check that up.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, first the canteen facilities for the detainees.\r\n\r\nThe  detainees  do  have  canteen facilities  to  purchase  cigarettes \r\n\r\nand  tobacco, toilet  articles, confectionery and groceries.  \r\n\r\nThe suggestion  by  the  Member  for  Anson  that   the detainees  \r\n\r\nshould  be able to  purchase  meals  and drinks is, in fact, receiving attention now.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as to the suggestion that the detainees should be\r\n\r\nallowed to receive their families on  the island,  this  question has \r\n\r\nbeen  gone  into  since 1961.  There  are  a  number of difficulties  \r\n\r\nquite apart  from  the difficulty of getting launches  to convey  the  \r\n\r\nfamilies of these detainees  to  Pulau Senang  Island.  There  is  also  \r\n\r\nthe  question  of security  and  also the construction  of  a  jetty. \r\n\r\nUntil  the  jetty is constructed, it  is  just  not possible  to  make  \r\n\r\na  start and,  in  fact,  if  I recollect,  we  have, since the end of  \r\n\r\nlast  year, managed to secure a launch for this purpose and  we are  now  \r\n\r\njust  waiting for the completion  of  the jetty   to  commence  conveying  \r\n\r\nthe  families   of detainees to Pulau Senang. I must emphasise that as far\r\n\r\nas these detainees are concerned, work is of  a voluntary nature, regarded \r\n\r\nand accepted as part  of their training  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand rehabilitation process. In their case, work has a  therapeutic meaning, \r\n\r\nand wages are  a  secondary matter. What they receive is regarded as a means \r\n\r\nto provide them with a few extra amenities of living. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the Member for Anson's dispute that their work is voluntary. Sir, I do agree with the\r\n\r\nMember for  Anson that detainees have been told, or it  is more  or less \r\n\r\nindicated to them, that if they  want to  secure  their early release, they  \r\n\r\nmust  go  to Pulau  Senang. That is accepted. Because how do  we assess  \r\n\r\nwhether  a detainee is fit for  release  to society? How do we observe whether \r\n\r\nthe detainee has changed  his attitude towards society, has  decided to  \r\n\r\nreform and to make an honest living  if  he  is given a chance outside? \r\n\r\nThe only way, I suggest, is through the work that he does in Pulau Senang,  \r\n\r\nhis behaviour  in  Pulau Senang; then  we  can  observe whether he has really \r\n\r\nreformed. Therefore, work is, shall  we  say,  necessary, and,  in  fact,  it \r\n\r\nis recommended by the ad hoc committee on Pulau Senang scheme - that is, rehabilitation \r\n\r\nthrough work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is some political\r\n\r\nmotive. We hear from the  Member for Anson that the detainees in Pulau Senang \r\n\r\nshould be  paid  the  rate for the job according  to  good trade union principles. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson has even gone so far as to suggest\r\n\r\nthat the Government  is guilty  of employing slave labour in Pulau  Senang. \r\n\r\nMay  I, with  respect, suggest to the  Member  for Anson that this is completely \r\n\r\nsanctimonious humbug. Let us view the concept of Pulau Senang in a proper light.  \r\n\r\nThis  is  a  scheme to rehabilitate  secret society gangsters. It is not a matter\r\n\r\nof the wicked P.A.P.  Government  catching  innocent  people  and putting  them \r\n\r\nto do some slave work for the benefit of  the P.A.P. or the Government. Now. Sir, \r\n\r\nlet  us suppose  that  the  Government  is  so  absurd,  so ridiculous, as to \r\n\r\naccept the proposal of the Member for  Anson and pay these detainees in Pulau \r\n\r\nSenang the  rate for a job - let us say, $4.50 for unskilled labour,  going  to  \r\n\r\n$8.50 for masons,  and  so  on. Surely, he will understand  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  if this were the case,  then  there would  be a standing invitation to \r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public to join secret societies and thereby to  get a remunerative \r\n\r\ncareer in Pulau Senang with food and everything thrown in. The purpose of the work  \r\n\r\nthat they do is not for the Government to make money out of  it. If they rear poultry \r\n\r\nand collect eggs,  the eggs  do not come to the Ministers on the breakfast table;  \r\n\r\nthe  benefit goes back to the detainees  in the  form of more amenities for them.\r\n\r\nBut the  main thing is to impress upon these people that work  is creative  and  is \r\n\r\nof  value  to  society  and   to inculcate in these unfortunate young men  pride  in \r\n\r\nwork and a sense of social responsibility. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one matter connected with the\r\n\r\nscheme which has not been mentioned, that is the follow-up work  on detainees in Pulau \r\n\r\nSenang. After they have had   a  good  record,  shown  responsibility   and leadership,  \r\n\r\nthey  are given a trial  in  the  Work Brigade  camp  where I must say that many  of \r\n\r\nthem have  proved  to  be very creditable  members.  The particular camp which graduates\r\n\r\nof Pulau Senang  go to, I think, is the most efficient camp in the Work Brigade.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, the courteous effort of the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  to  answer   my criticism had, for a moment, made me forget that we were \r\n\r\nin  a  Chamber dominated by the P.A.P.  I  am indebted  to  the  Minister  for  \r\n\r\nFinance  for  his Alibanesque   contribution  to  the   debate.   \r\n\r\nThe \"sanctimonious humbug\" of which he speaks  is  very apt  to those who can \r\n\r\nspeak of pride in work  being paid  30 cents a day whilst your family starves  \r\n\r\non social welfare pittances. That is the kind of pride in  work  that the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncan speak about. That  is the kind of men they say they produce, men who take a  \r\n\r\nsense  of  social responsibility - whilst  their families starve, they sweat at \r\n\r\nhard labour  in  the sun  with  pick  and shovel and get  paid  by  this beneficent \r\n\r\nGovernment 30 cents a day.

So  far,   394\r\n\r\ndetainees  have successfully been rehabilitated  at\r\n\r\nPulau Senang.

The  rest\r\n\r\nreturn  to their homes and to society free to  come\r\n\r\nand  go, subject to easy supervision conditions for\r\n\r\na  short period as a final test as to whether their\r\n\r\nrehabilitation is complete.

Be that as it  may,\r\n\r\nlet me come to my motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the operative word here is \"progress\", and I\r\n\r\ncan  understand that there is a divergence of views\r\n\r\non the meaning of \"progress\". English, Sir, is such\r\n\r\na difficult language to understand that sometimes\r\n\r\na  word can have two or three meanings. The meaning\r\n\r\nthat  I  want  to imply in this word \"progress\"  is\r\n\r\nnot,  shall  we say, the terms of an  agreement  or\r\n\r\ndisagreement  that have taken place in  the  Inter-Governmental Committee. What I mean to imply by  my\r\n\r\nmotion  is  the  rate of progress,  to  come  to  a\r\n\r\nfinalisation  on such an important issue  on  which\r\n\r\nhangs the coming into existence of Malaysia on 31st\r\n\r\nAugust, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his statement this\r\n\r\nafternoon disclosed that there has been  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nhard bargaining going on, and we do sympathise with\r\n\r\nhim  that there has been this hard bargaining.  But\r\n\r\nwhat we find it difficult to forgive him is the way\r\n\r\nin   which   he  hoped  to  circumvent  this   hard\r\n\r\nbargaining. He did say earlier this afternoon  that\r\n\r\nhe felt that it would not be appropriate to mention\r\n\r\nin this House the discussions that have taken place\r\n\r\nbetween the Singapore Government and the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  on the financial talks that  have  been\r\n\r\ntaking  place since February. But what  I  fail  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  is  this.  Why,  if  he  considers   it\r\n\r\ninappropriate,  should he find  it  appropriate  to\r\n\r\ngive  statements  to  Press reporters  whenever  he\r\n\r\ncomes  back after his discussions in Kuala  Lumpur,\r\n\r\nand  why  should he find it appropriate during  his\r\n\r\nvisits  to  the rural constituencies  to  tell  the\r\n\r\npeople what he thinks should be the right thing for\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  what the Federation  Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to  do  to  Singapore  in  regard  to  this\r\n\r\nfinancial arrangement. That is something  which  we\r\n\r\nfind it difficult to understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have great respect for the intelligence of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister, but we find it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nappreciate  this  intelligence  when  he  tries  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate on matters of national issue through  the\r\n\r\nPress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\nbeen giving statements to the Press on matters that\r\n\r\nhave been discussed in Kuala Lumpur. The statements\r\n\r\nat Times prove very confusing reading. At one Time,\r\n\r\nwe  read that the Prime Minister was going to fight\r\n\r\nto the bitter end and the very next morning we read\r\n\r\nin  the papers that the Prime Minister said, \"There\r\n\r\nis  nothing  wrong.  Things can  be  settled  quite\r\n\r\namicably.\" This brought confusion in the  minds  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the things I want to focus attention on\r\n\r\nis  this:  the  Prime Minister  is  very  adept  at\r\n\r\npropaganda,  while the Minister for  Culture  says,\r\n\r\n\"What  is  wrong, if we are good at this particular\r\n\r\ngame  to  knock out the Communists?\" I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.  There  is nothing wrong there.  But  what  is\r\n\r\nwrong  is  this:  the  Prime Minister  is  fond  of\r\n\r\nindulging  in  propaganda hoping to reap  political\r\n\r\ncapital  out of propaganda based on something  that\r\n\r\nis not correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us take the most important Press\r\n\r\nstatement which he gave some months ago. I think it\r\n\r\nwas  after the March or April sitting.

The most important  Press\r\n\r\nstatement he gave was this, \"Ah, that monster,  the\r\n\r\nMinister of Finance in Kuala Lumpur, wants to  take\r\n\r\nall  the money from Singapore and to creep  in  and\r\n\r\nmilk  Singapore  in order that our social  services\r\n\r\nwill  go  abegging.\"  That was the  impression  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister created. We got that impression,  so\r\n\r\nmuch  so  that  we  even swallowed  that  wonderful\r\n\r\npropaganda.  We felt, \"Oh, God, our Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nis  right.  There is no reason why  the  Federation\r\n\r\nFinance Minister must take all the Federal  tax  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  control us from Kuala  Lumpur.\"  We\r\n\r\nfelt  sorry for him and we took that line. We  said\r\n\r\nthat  he was right. The Federal taxes collected  in\r\n\r\nSingapore must remain in Singapore.

If he will look at page 2, sub-paragraph   4,  the  sum  total  result   of   that\r\n\r\nmemorandum was that we owed the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFederation money.

I am not a financial expert.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance can take the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  through all the various  intricacies  of\r\n\r\nthe arguments.

It  means that there shall  be  no  further\r\n\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance says surely there are a lot of other technical obstacles. What technical obstacles there\r\n\r\nare, have  been  created  by  the P.A.P. Government for ten months!  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then again the impression given by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  who  has  taken  upon  himself  to  give\r\n\r\nstatements  on  the discussions  on  the  financial\r\n\r\ntalks and brush aside his Minister for Finance, and\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance has accepted that brushing\r\n\r\naside   so   tamely  and  so  quietly.  The   other\r\n\r\nimpression given was this: Au, the surplus. The pre-Malaysia  surplus, not the surplus after  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nbut  the pre-Malaysia surplus. 1959, 1960, 1961 and\r\n\r\n1962. That monster, the Minister of Finance of  the\r\n\r\nFederation, wants to grab it all. But that  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  position. What is disclosed by this  statement\r\n\r\nis  that the Finance Minister wants to grab it all.\r\n\r\nBut that is not the position. What is disclosed  by\r\n\r\nthis  statement  is that what the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nwants to grab is the surplus after Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

We must have some sort of\r\n\r\norder from the Government Front bench, otherwise we\r\n\r\nwill  never  get on. And I would suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill look at Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is what he said, \"wants to\r\n\r\ngrab\".  Grab  is the impression he created  in  the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people, so I gave what my impression\r\n\r\nwas. We felt it was wrong too. We felt that Federal\r\n\r\ntaxes collected in Singapore should not be taken to\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur. We felt that pre-Malaysia  surpluses\r\n\r\nshould  be  the absolute property of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We felt it so much that we went to Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  and  made representations. The S.P.A. made\r\n\r\nrepresentations that such things,  if  right,  were\r\n\r\nwrong.  But  we were told there had  been  no  such\r\n\r\nintention  at  all to take pre-Malaysia  surpluses.\r\n\r\nThere  is  no  intention at all that Federal  taxes\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore should be sent up  to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur and then the Singapore Government would have\r\n\r\nto  go  to  the  Federation  Finance  Minister  for\r\n\r\ndishing  out Singapore's proportion of the  revenue\r\n\r\nfor   its  own  budget.  Therefore  the  impression\r\n\r\ncreated was all wrong. But then when we found  that\r\n\r\nthe  impression created in the minds was wrong,  we\r\n\r\nbegan  to realise that this was nothing but  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nfirst-class propaganda. They wanted to make it  out\r\n\r\nto  the  people  of Singapore that they  fought  so\r\n\r\nhard,  they  fought  so bitterly,  they  fought  so\r\n\r\nconsistently   that   money  from   Federal   taxes\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore would remain in Singapore in\r\n\r\na  neutral  fund  and  that pre-Malaysia  surpluses\r\n\r\nwould  be  the absolute property of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Why  did they play that  game?  Because\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  to make it appear to  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, with an eye to the general elections  in\r\n\r\n1964, that they were the champions of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do not blame the Prime Minister for\r\n\r\nindulging  in  that kind of propaganda,  but  I  do\r\n\r\nblame  him for this. That if we are a party to  any\r\n\r\nnegotiation,  it  is  the  first  requirement  that\r\n\r\neither  party  should  not  do  anything  to  cause\r\n\r\nembarrassment to the other party, so that there can\r\n\r\nbe  better  understanding, better co-operation  and\r\n\r\nbetter  working  out of a solution  to  the  mutual\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  both parties. Instead of  which  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister went out tearing hard at the  other\r\n\r\nparty,  that  is  to  say, the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaya,  making out that he was a great  hero.  And\r\n\r\ncould  we  say  that  it  was  as  expected,   that\r\n\r\nretaliation   came   almost  forthwith   from   the\r\n\r\nFederation side that the Prime Minister was talking\r\n\r\nOut of turn, that the Prime Minister was trying  to\r\n\r\nnegotiate  through the Press, that what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister said was wrong; and not only that but they\r\n\r\nwent  so far as to let out a few skeletons  in  the\r\n\r\ncupboard?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that method of negotiation is all wrong\r\n\r\nand  it is because of the manner in which the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has indulged in trying to negotiate  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government that  I  have  felt  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  bring this motion to  the  House  in\r\n\r\norder to put the Prime Minister on the right track.\r\n\r\nYou  can  only  negotiate in the quietness  of  the\r\n\r\nconference  room,  each party giving  his  case  as\r\n\r\neffectively and as forcefully as he can muster, but\r\n\r\nnot   to   come  out  in  the  Press   before   the\r\n\r\nnegotiations  were concluded one way or  the  other\r\n\r\nand try to label the other party as a big bad wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement given by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\ntoday did not disclose that there was any intention\r\n\r\nwhatsoever on the part of the Federation Government\r\n\r\nto  want  to  take over the pre-Malaysia surpluses.\r\n\r\nAnd one more significant point in this statement of\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister is this. He kept on saying that\r\n\r\nthe   other  party  was  the  Government   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya,  but  in  all   his   Press\r\n\r\nstatements,  what  did  he say?  The  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance,  the President of the M.C.A. But  here  he\r\n\r\ndid  the right thing. He had been negotiating  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government of the Federation of Malaya and not\r\n\r\nwith the Minister of Finance, Mr Tan Siew Sin, the\r\n\r\nPresident of the M.C.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this statement also discloses the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  very  first  plenary  session  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Committee  took  place  on  the  28th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1963, and then there were a few  meetings\r\n\r\nin  March, then in April, and then again in May and\r\n\r\nJune.  Let  us  come  to  the  April  meeting.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  gave,  as  an  excuse  to  shorten  the\r\n\r\nsittings of this Assembly last April, the necessity\r\n\r\nof  the  presence  of the Prime  Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance in inter-governmental\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalks  in the Federation.  On  the  9th  of\r\n\r\nApril,  while  the debate was still raging  on  the\r\n\r\nmotion  in  connection  with  the  action  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment against subversives, the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nleft  for Kuala Lumpur that evening. The very  next\r\n\r\nmorning, while the Member for Queenstown was  still\r\n\r\non  his  feet  talking right up to 6  a.m. in  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  the  Prime Minister was  safely  away  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur. Not only was he safely away, but  he\r\n\r\nwas  actually  engaged in a game of golf.  We  were\r\n\r\ntold that the reason why the Prime Minister and the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance had to go to Kuala Lumpur  on\r\n\r\nthe  10th of April was that crucial talks  were  to\r\n\r\ntake place between the Government of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  of the Federation of  Malaya,  but\r\n\r\nthen because of the war that had been engendered by\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister,  the war  in  the  newspapers\r\n\r\nbetween  the  Prime  Minister  and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Finance, it led to a lot  of  unhappy\r\n\r\ndisclosures, so much so that a disclosure was  even\r\n\r\nmade - and that has not yet been denied - that  on  the\r\n\r\n10th of April, the date that the Prime Minister was\r\n\r\nto have a meeting in Kuala Lumpur on crucial talks,\r\n\r\nhe  was absent on the grounds that he was too tired\r\n\r\nafter  having  played  a game  of  golf  the  whole\r\n\r\nmorning.  I  did  not say it. But  it  was  in  the\r\n\r\npapers. I will not quote it. The Prime Minister can\r\n\r\nget  all  his  assistants to read it.  He  did  not\r\n\r\nattend that meeting on the 10th ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister rose ---\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I just would like to be\r\n\r\nreferred to the newspaper  - the cutting - because  I\r\n\r\nhave never on any occasion remembered my being  too\r\n\r\ntired  to  attend a meeting because of  a  game  of\r\n\r\ngolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to point out the exact news item  in\r\n\r\nthe newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am sorry to see our poor\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is confused.

There can be only one side\r\n\r\nfor  any  political Party in Singapore - the side  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. But it all depends on the\r\n\r\nway that any political Party implements that vow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going into the details of what has been\r\n\r\nsaid  by the Prime Minister, what has been demanded\r\n\r\nby  the  other side, and what has been demanded  by\r\n\r\nthis  side.  That is still left for  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment to negotiate with the Government of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya. But what I do urge  upon  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister is this. It would be  most  foolish\r\n\r\nand  suicidal  to  try  and negotiate  through  the\r\n\r\nPress,   and   the   sooner  he   understands   and\r\n\r\nappreciates  that,  the sooner a better  atmosphere\r\n\r\nwill  prevail in the Inter-Governmental  Committee.\r\n\r\nRemember, Sir, about that meeting last April?  What\r\n\r\nhappened?  Nothing came out of it - it blew  up.  The\r\n\r\nPrime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister,  according to Press reports,  - if  not  on\r\n\r\nthe 10th, then it must be the 11th or the 12th, you\r\n\r\ncan  see  it - the  Prime Minister according  to  all\r\n\r\nthat,  it was agreed that there should be no  Press\r\n\r\nreleases  other than an agreed Press  release.  The\r\n\r\nagreed Press release was duly issued, but when  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister came home and after having been  met\r\n\r\nby the members and reporters of the local Press, he\r\n\r\nwent  to town. He started calling names. He started\r\n\r\nsaying that this was wrong and that was wrong.  For\r\n\r\nall  we  know, he may be right in saying all  those\r\n\r\nthings. But what I say is that it is wrong for  him\r\n\r\nto  say  all those things. After having  reached  a\r\n\r\nsolemn    agreement   in   the   Inter-Governmental\r\n\r\nCommittee,  there should be no Press  releases,  he\r\n\r\ngave  a  Press  interview. Then  there  followed  a\r\n\r\ncounter-attack from the Federation, and this  makes\r\n\r\nsad   reading.  Sad  reading  to  the   people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. And what makes matters more sad was that\r\n\r\nit   even  brought  the  Chairman  of  the   Inter-Governmental Committee, Tun Razak, to give a  Press\r\n\r\nstatement  rebuking our Prime Minister. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister can read that particular  Press\r\n\r\nstatement.  We all did see in it the  local  Press;\r\n\r\nand   whether  that  rebuke  administered  by   the\r\n\r\nChairman  of  the Inter-Governmental Committee  was\r\n\r\ndeserved by him or not we have not as yet read  any\r\n\r\nstatement  from him denying that, or accepting  the\r\n\r\nrebuke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Sir, the Prime Minister is very\r\n\r\nfond  of negotiating in public is this. Every  week\r\n\r\nhe goes round baby-kissing in the rural areas. That\r\n\r\ndoes  not matter. He can go and kiss as many babies\r\n\r\nas  he wants. Nobody minds that. But at every visit\r\n\r\nof  his  to  the  rural constituencies,  he  starts\r\n\r\nblaring  out \"the trend of negotiations\"  in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur. Does he consider that it is a wise thing to\r\n\r\ndo? Or is he doing that with a particular political\r\n\r\npurpose?  Surely,  Sir, as our Prime  Minister,  we\r\n\r\nexpect  him  to be more circumspect in  his  public\r\n\r\nutterances; that, in so far as a national issue  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, he should try to represent the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  the  best possible  manner,  without\r\n\r\ngiving the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother side the opportunity nor the right to run him\r\n\r\ndown,  to  say that what he was trying  to  do  was\r\n\r\nnothing but a political stunt. That is what he  did - going  round kissing babies and  disseminating\r\n\r\npolitical propaganda. He visits the rural areas  as\r\n\r\nPrime Minister. But in all his speeches it was  the\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the P.A.P. that was going  out\r\n\r\nspouting political propaganda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry, Sir, if I spent a little time going\r\n\r\nthrough my notes, because ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because you had nothing to\r\n\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> --- we did not expect that this\r\n\r\nmotion  would  come  up. But anyway,  what  we  are\r\n\r\nagainst  is  not  what has been  discussed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, but rather the way in which  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has been handling this situation. Sir,  it\r\n\r\nis now agreed, even the Prime Minister has said it,\r\n\r\nthat what is left to be settled is the question  of\r\n\r\napportionment:  how much to go to  the  Federation,\r\n\r\nhow much to go to Singapore. And also the ratio  of\r\n\r\ndistribution of post-Malaysia surplus. That is what\r\n\r\nI  understand  from this statement.  In  regard  to\r\n\r\napportionment, Sir, I would like the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nto  make a categorical statement in this House.  In\r\n\r\nNovember  1961,  when  the  Prime  Minister  tabled\r\n\r\nCommand  Paper  33 for debate, he told  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  it  had  been  agreed  between  him  and  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Prime  Minister that the  apportionment\r\n\r\nwould  be  on  the  basis of 25 per  cent  for  the\r\n\r\nFederation, 75 per cent for Singapore. But it would\r\n\r\nseem  from  this  statement here  today,  that  the\r\n\r\napportionment ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of order, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the exchange of letters\r\n\r\nwere  tabled in this House in which the phrase  was\r\n\r\ncarefully used, \"that we shall keep more than three-quarters of our revenue.\" I think that paraphrasing\r\n\r\nme  when documents have been produced in this House\r\n\r\ndoes not help the debate. The motion is, \"That this\r\n\r\nHouse  expresses concern with the progress,\" and  I\r\n\r\ncannot but join in the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconcern.  The  motion  is not  concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nmanner in which we have negotiated but is concerned\r\n\r\nwith  the  progress. And I would like to raise  two\r\n\r\npoints.   First,  that  the  Member  for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nconfines himself, when he quotes from authority, to\r\n\r\nthe documents that have been produced at that Time;\r\n\r\nsecondly, that he confines himself to this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did more or less anticipate\r\n\r\nall  these  difficulties and  I  did  hint  that  I\r\n\r\nconsidered  that  the debate  on  this  motion  was\r\n\r\npremature. The Prime Minister said he would produce\r\n\r\na  White Paper in due course. The debate could take\r\n\r\nplace  on  the  White  Paper. But  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  insisted, and now he  finds  himself  in\r\n\r\nthese difficulties. The Prime Minister, I think, is\r\n\r\ncorrect  when he says that if there is to  be  some\r\n\r\nreference  to a document specifically,  a  specific\r\n\r\nquote should be made from that document, and not  a\r\n\r\nmere  paraphrase. On the other point as to  whether\r\n\r\nor not what has been said is relevant. I suppose it\r\n\r\nis relevant in passing. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am not quoting from a\r\n\r\ndocument, Sir,I said that was what he said  during\r\n\r\nthe  sitting  in November 1961.

On reading  through\r\n\r\nthe  whole statement, it shows one thing. It  is  a\r\n\r\nreport  of  the different stages towards  surrender\r\n\r\nand  finally of abject surrender by the P.A.P.  The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister talks of the quantum of Singapore's\r\n\r\ncontribution and the responsibility for  collection\r\n\r\nof  national  taxes in Singapore after merger,  and\r\n\r\nthese  talks are important enough to have  affected\r\n\r\nquite  a  number  f  services  ill  the  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  For  example, you might  have  heard.\r\n\r\nSir,  that there are already strikes in the  Police\r\n\r\nDepartment.  You  might also  know  that  they  are\r\n\r\nthreatening a strike in the P. & T. Department. All\r\n\r\nthese  are Pan-Malayan departments and who controls\r\n\r\nthe   money   and  pays  the  salaries   in   these\r\n\r\ndepartments  will  have a great  hearing  on  these\r\n\r\nstrikes.   The  Parliamentary  Secretary   to   the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Culture, of course, understands  this\r\n\r\nvery  well, and he is responsible for many  of  the\r\n\r\ndemands  that  are  now  conveyed  to  the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment.  But  this  statement  by   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has revealed certain other things which we\r\n\r\nnever  knew before. You see, Sir, all the Time  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has been giving the impression to the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore that the differences between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation  are only  on  the  matter  of\r\n\r\nsurpluses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a forum in the Nantah about a week or so ago,\r\n\r\nwe  exposed  this so-called surplus  angle  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. But I will come to this later. The two other\r\n\r\nimportant  points which the statement has  revealed\r\n\r\nare:  there  is  a new thing called Pan-  Malaysian\r\n\r\nexpenditure;  and  there is another  new  thing  of\r\n\r\npayment to the Borneo territories of $50 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have run through the White Paper very, very\r\n\r\ncarefully, Sir, with a tooth comb, but nowhere have\r\n\r\nI been able to find the word \"Malaysian\" - common Pan-Malaysian expenditure. This is something  which  is\r\n\r\nentirely new and which the people of Singapore have\r\n\r\nso  far not been told of. The other one is this $50\r\n\r\nmillion.  All  this merely shows  that  the  money,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  the  bone  of  contention  between   the\r\n\r\nFederation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  Singapore,  will ultimately be  used  for  the\r\n\r\nexpansion  of the armed forces for the  suppression\r\n\r\nof  the people in this region. The money which  the\r\n\r\nFederation   wants   will  be  spent   on   capital\r\n\r\nimprovements  in fighting-ships, fighting-vehicles,\r\n\r\nfighting-equipment,  all in order  to  prevent  the\r\n\r\nrealisation of the hopes and aspirations  not  only\r\n\r\nof  the  people of Singapore but also of the Borneo\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.

I have indicated my views as\r\n\r\nto  how  the debate should go. The motion asks  the\r\n\r\nHouse to view\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith concern the progress made by the Government in\r\n\r\nits  talks relating to Head 17 of Paper Command  33\r\n\r\nof  1961.  The Prime Minister has set  out  in  his\r\n\r\nstatement the progress made so far, and the  debate\r\n\r\nnow  should  be as to whether or not  the  Assembly\r\n\r\nshould  view with concern the progress as  detailed\r\n\r\nin the statement of the Prune Minister. That is all\r\n\r\nwe are debating to-night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But it would be enlightening,\r\n\r\nSir,  that whilst we go by what the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas  revealed to-night, we should also go  by  what\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister has said to the Press. Unless we\r\n\r\ndo  that,  Sir,  we shall not be able  to  see  the\r\n\r\ndeception which the Prime Minister has practised on\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. It is pertinent  at  this\r\n\r\npoint that we bring out certain facts to show  that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. is not above-board in all its dealings.\r\n\r\nHere,  in this statement, the Prime Minister, first\r\n\r\nof  all,  reveals that on 21st March the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment proposed that Singapore should bear 21.2\r\n\r\nper    cent   of   certain   common   Pan-Malaysian\r\n\r\nexpenditure  such  as defence,  internal  security,\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs,  Parliament,  etc.  As  I   have\r\n\r\nalready  said,  this is something which  we  cannot\r\n\r\nfind  in  the  White  Paper. But,  of  course,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment may have another story to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the Government of the\r\n\r\nFederation insists on is that the total revenue  of\r\n\r\nSingapore should be collected and controlled by the\r\n\r\nFederation   and  that  only  certain  revenue   be\r\n\r\nassigned to the State to enable Singapore  to  meet\r\n\r\nher  obligations  in  the State itself.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nthis  question  of the so-called surplus  does  not\r\n\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a letter to the Straits Times on 25th of\r\n\r\nMay,  the  Deputy  Controller of Supply,  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nfrom the Treasury in Kuala Lumpur, revealed that it\r\n\r\nis  not  a  matter  of surplus or deficit,  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore has  all  the  Time  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  tell  the people of  Singapore,  but  a\r\n\r\nmatter of percentage to be apportioned between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  Governments.  And he revealed  that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of X per cent to the Federation and  Y  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  Singapore. Once the percentage  has  been\r\n\r\nassigned, it is entirely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na matter of State budgeting, whether there is  a surplus or deficit. That was the position from  the very  beginning, as insisted upon by the Federation Finance Minister, Mr Tan Siew Sin. But, of course, as   revealed  in  this  statement,  the  Singapore Government objects, and it objects because of  one, two  and three reasons. But, if you will look, Sir, at  No. (ii) - I will pick on No. (ii) , which is on\r\n\r\n3 - it  means that the Singapore Government  in\r\n\r\neffect had already accepted in principle the matter\r\n\r\nof  percentage to be contributed to the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  P.A.P. merely  complains  of  the\r\n\r\npercentage  being too high. That is  all.  But  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of percentage had already been  accepted\r\n\r\nby   the   Singapore   Government,   although   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore insist  on  a  couple  of\r\n\r\nconditions,  namely,  the  representation  in   the\r\n\r\nCentral Parliament and the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have all along been saying that\r\n\r\nrepresentation in the Central Parliament is a  very\r\n\r\nimportant thing, and we are glad to note  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government has at last admitted  this  very\r\n\r\nfact.  I wish also to draw your attention, Sir,  to\r\n\r\nwhat the Prime Minister has been telling the people\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 23rd of March in the Straits Times, he\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"We  must  collect and  keep  and  pay.  The\r\n\r\nFederation Government understand this. I  think  we\r\n\r\nhave  been  sufficiently articulate.\" This  is  the\r\n\r\nvery  firm  stand  of the Government,  for  in  the\r\n\r\nheadlines  in the Straits Times it says, \"We  stand\r\n\r\npat.\"   Yet   whilst  saying  that  the   Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment   must  collect  and  keel)   and   then\r\n\r\ncontribute,  the  Prime Minister in  his  statement\r\n\r\nhere  reveals  that  the Singapore  Government  had\r\n\r\nalready   accepted  the  principle  of   percentage\r\n\r\ncontribution.   He   only   complained    of    the\r\n\r\ncontribution of 21.2 per cent being too  high.  But\r\n\r\nother  than  that,  the whole  principle  has  been\r\n\r\nadmitted and everything agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then whilst talking about these three factors on\r\n\r\npage   4,  namely,  representation  in  Parliament,\r\n\r\npopulation and economic growth, the Government also\r\n\r\nrevealed that any percentage payment to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Federation would mean a built-in  increase  in\r\n\r\npayment to the Federation and, therefore, so far as\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned, something which the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncould  not  agree to. Mr Jek Yuen Thong, Political\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister, wrote in a  letter\r\n\r\nto  the  Straits Times that this built-in  increase\r\n\r\nwould   arise   from   the  natural   increase   in\r\n\r\nconsumption, from the large number of taxes over  a\r\n\r\nwider  range of commodities, and from the  increase\r\n\r\nin   the   actual  level  of  taxation.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nalthough it says that a percentage payment is  very\r\n\r\ndisadvantageous   to  Singapore,   the   Government\r\n\r\nnevertheless accepted this principle of  percentage\r\n\r\npayment to the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On page 4, it says the payment should be based on\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure. But what  difference  does  it\r\n\r\nmake  whether the actual expenditure should  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  case of 1961 or 1962? Because, as revealed  in\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister's  statement,  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nfuture expenditure will be unpredictable; in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  expenditure will be mounting  and  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  from  Singapore  will  similarly   be\r\n\r\nmounting. They try to save face over the fact  that\r\n\r\nactual  expenditure must mean that the  Accountant-General  submits audited accounts.  This  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  anything  except to show  that  even  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  Government to Government  negotiations,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. clearly does not trust the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Otherwise, why insist on this?  Unless\r\n\r\nthere  is  fear that everything is not above-board,\r\n\r\nyou  need  not  insist  on  the  Accountant-General\r\n\r\nsubmitting his accounts of actual expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then these three factors, namely representation in\r\n\r\nParliament,  population and economic growth - in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers a fourth factor is added, i.e. the  size\r\n\r\nof   the   area  to  be  defended.  The  Government\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  when it comes to the agreement,  has\r\n\r\nclean  forgotten these factors other than  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  which the Government equates with  the  so-called  common market. Representation in Parliament\r\n\r\nis  forgotten. Population factor is forgotten.  The\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  of  face-saving  that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment gives the Prime Minister is this talk of\r\n\r\nso-called  limited common market. But  we  must  be\r\n\r\ncareful about this common market\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbusiness, Sir, because, as far as we know, the\r\n\r\nform   of  common  market  which  the  P.A.P. had\r\n\r\noriginally  envisaged is that there must  be  joint\r\n\r\nconsultation  at the top as regards how  industries\r\n\r\nshould be sited and assigned. Only then would  the\r\n\r\ninterests of Singapore be adequately looked  after;\r\n\r\notherwise it amounts to surrender. A's it  is,  the\r\n\r\nonly form of common market arrangement that we know\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government will agree to is one  in\r\n\r\nwhich the Federation has complete control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> How do you know?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Well, would you let us know\r\n\r\nthen, if that is not the case!

A little while\r\n\r\nback, for example, the Prime Minister said that  he\r\n\r\nhas  never  said  that 25 per cent  of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nrevenue  would be given to the Federation.  I  have\r\n\r\nhere a statement issued by the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that  25  per cent  is  all  that  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government would be contributing. I  will\r\n\r\nread  this little bit from the statement, and I  am\r\n\r\nsure, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will appreciate that to\r\n\r\nconfine  myself  strictly to the  progress  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment would be quite difficult. This is  a\r\n\r\nstatement issued by the Singapore Government on 7th\r\n\r\nFebruary, 1962, and Dr Goh Keng Swee was answering\r\n\r\nMr  Chan Chiaw Thor, who is now being detained  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What date?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and the statement reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Minister explained that a certain sum was meant to meet the cost of two items, namely, the contribution to the Federation Government and (1) certain departments which are now run by the Singapore Government but which, on merger, will be run by the Central Government. For example, Police, Post Office, Telecommunication, Civil Aviation,\r\n\r\nPrisons,  the Audit 0ffice and the Defence  Forces.\r\n\r\nThe  recurrent loss of the department is about  $62\r\n\r\nmillion,  the  development  expenditure   about   8\r\n\r\nmillion a year; and (2)  Singapore will have to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  its  share of Pan-Malayan Defence Forces,  the\r\n\r\nForeign Office and certain State institutions  such\r\n\r\nas  the  Central Parliament. Dr Goh estimated  the\r\n\r\nannual  share at $8 million. This makes a total  of\r\n\r\n$78  million  a year or nearly one-quarter  of  the\r\n\r\nestimated revenue for 1961, which was $345 million.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the reason why the contribution Singapore\r\n\r\nmakes  to  the Central Government has been  put  as\r\n\r\nabout 25 per cent.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Further down, the statement reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The real additional expenditure to Singapore will\r\n\r\nbe  around $8 million a year only representing  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  Singapore's share in the Malayan  Defence\r\n\r\nForces  and the Foreign Service.

Finally - this\r\n\r\nwas  an exchange of letters dated 11th November  - we\r\n\r\nhave  agreed  that Singapore would keep  more  than\r\n\r\nthree-quarters of her revenue for the discharge  of\r\n\r\nher  responsibilities on education, labour,  social\r\n\r\nwelfare, health and all the other matters  set  out\r\n\r\nas  State  or  concurrent responsibilities  in  the\r\n\r\nschedule  annexed to our memorandum and be entitled\r\n\r\nto  15  seats in the Central Parliament of the  new\r\n\r\nFederation. Now, in our estimation then,  in  broad\r\n\r\noutline, being entitled to 15 seats on merger which\r\n\r\nwas on very\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecial conditions, we envisaged that we would keep\r\n\r\nmore  than three-quarters of our revenue, and  that\r\n\r\nis still the position  - unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not for me to comment on the tactics of\r\n\r\nan Opposition leader whose Party headquarters is in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur.  But  I  must  thank  him  for   the\r\n\r\ncompliment  he  paid  me in my absence  on  Friday,\r\n\r\nnamely,  that he wanted - in fact he was anxious  for\r\n\r\nan occasion - to confront me. In other words, he, the\r\n\r\nagent  of the principal in Kuala Lumpur, was  going\r\n\r\nto confront me today, and I waited 45 minutes as he\r\n\r\nwaffled on and on for that moment of confrontation.\r\n\r\nOn  whose side is he? He says he is on the side  of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. What else could he say? If\r\n\r\nhe  were on the side of the people of Singapore, he\r\n\r\nshould be prepared to stand up to his principals in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur,  as we have done, and  say  to  them\r\n\r\nexactly  where they get off. I know that in  saying\r\n\r\nthis,  we become unpopular with people who will  be\r\n\r\nin   authority   over  Malaysia,   which   includes\r\n\r\nSingapore, after 31st August. There will have to be\r\n\r\na  settlement on fair and honourable terms based on\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper before the 31st. It will be tabled\r\n\r\nhere in detail, and adopted after proper debate. We\r\n\r\nadjourned  after our meeting in April in  the  hope\r\n\r\nthat  we would achieve agreement before the  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the Federation went off  on  his\r\n\r\ntour  of the United States and Britain, which  tour\r\n\r\nwas  expected  to take a month. Unfortunately,  our\r\n\r\nplea  for  a  meeting was construed as  a  sign  of\r\n\r\nweakness. Therefore, for reasons which I thought to\r\n\r\nbe in the interests of the people, I did not attend\r\n\r\na  particular meeting in Kuala Lumpur and chose  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  Cameron Highlands with the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nof the Federation who was golfing with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golf is a very necessary asset in Malaysia, and a\r\n\r\nlot  of  valuable  and  important  information  was\r\n\r\nimparted   and   analysed  in  the  leisurely   and\r\n\r\nsometimes  enlightened and rarified  atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nthe  highlands.  On  many  an  occasion  I  thought\r\n\r\nperhaps  if  only Members on the other side  played\r\n\r\ngolf, they would not have made some of the colossal\r\n\r\nblunders that they had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to move an amendment to this motion,\r\n\r\nand  the amendment is to add at the end \"Paper Cmd.\r\n\r\n33  of  1961\" the words \"and expresses  its  desire\r\n\r\nthat  there should be an early settlement fair  and\r\n\r\njust to both sides on the basis of the terms of the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  which  has  been  approved  by   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> \"Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961\" instead of\r\n\r\n\"the White Paper\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> So be it, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is, at the end, to add -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"and expresses its desire that there should he an\r\n\r\nearls settlement fair and just to both sides on the\r\n\r\nbasis of the terms of Paper Cmd. 33 of 1961 which\r\n\r\nwas approved by this Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I stress\r\n\r\nthe  operative words \"on the basis of the terms  of\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd. 33 of 1961 which was approved  by  this\r\n\r\nAssembly\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to dwell at length on the\r\n\r\ntortuous  course of negotiations.  Clothed  in  the\r\n\r\nofficialese language of financial negotiators was a\r\n\r\nplan  by  which we were, in fact, not only to  lose\r\n\r\nall  our  surplus,  but  to be  owing  the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment money at the end of it. I refer to pages\r\n\r\n1  and  2.  We have moved away from that  position,\r\n\r\nfortunately, not least because we decided to  stand\r\n\r\nup  and talk up, I think, with as much courtesy  as\r\n\r\nthe  situation merits. There will have  to  be,  if\r\n\r\nneed be, more harsh words, but at the end of it, it\r\n\r\nis our duty to see that we produce to this House an\r\n\r\nagreement which is in accord with the principles of\r\n\r\nthe  merger which we approved in this Assembly  and\r\n\r\nwhich we placed before the people. We debated it at\r\n\r\ngreat  length and in great detail over a period  of\r\n\r\nnearly a year. There was no misunderstanding as  to\r\n\r\nthe intent, nor as to the language that was used in\r\n\r\nthese  solemn  documents. A departure  from  or  an\r\n\r\namendment  in  any respect to these  documents  can\r\n\r\nonly be if it is on a quid pro quo basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not wish to prejudice the future\r\n\r\ncourse  of  our negotiations, but I  would  like  a\r\n\r\ncategorical  assurance from Members  on  the  other\r\n\r\nside  that  they  are with us in this,  because  it\r\n\r\nhelps.  If the agents or parties whose headquarters\r\n\r\nare in Kuala Lumpur are with us, then obviously  it\r\n\r\nwill  be easier to persuade the principals in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur that it is unwise in the long run to try and\r\n\r\nalter  terms  which  may in the  end  work  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment of the whole of Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are for a strong Central Government, and we\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the most important element in  making\r\n\r\nany  government  of  the Federation  strong  is  to\r\n\r\ncommand the loyalty of its subjects, in this  case,\r\n\r\nthe 1.7 million people of Singapore. They have been\r\n\r\ntold for over a year, two years now, by people like\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown that they were sold down\r\n\r\nthe  drain, finished, enslaved by the Malays in the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and that what really  was  wanted  was\r\n\r\ncomplete   merger.  We  fought  them,  because   we\r\n\r\nbelieved  that  what we were doing  was  right.  If\r\n\r\nconviction  was lacking in what we were  doing,  we\r\n\r\nwould  have faltered before the cohorts  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  able to marshal. I promise this Assembly that\r\n\r\nwe  shall  produce that document in which all  that\r\n\r\nwas  agreed will be enshrined, and if there is  any\r\n\r\nalteration, it must be on a quid pro quo basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill says that we have been\r\n\r\nuntruthful.  Have we? Right at this moment  we  are\r\n\r\nasked  to  pay $50 million as a grant.  From  what?\r\n\r\nFrom  our surpluses. How can we pay if we have  not\r\n\r\ngot the money? I am not going to say whether we are\r\n\r\nor  we  are  not.  At this moment  I  think  it  is\r\n\r\nimpolite to reply in this Assembly. This debate has\r\n\r\nbeen triggered off by the tactics of the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  He  raised the question.  He  wanted  a\r\n\r\nstatement. He put a motion down. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nhe  said that he wanted to confront me. Well, I  am\r\n\r\nhere  to be confronted, and we never run away  from\r\n\r\nany  confrontation. We say this, you can bundle  up\r\n\r\nSingapore  on  a military plate, hand  it  over  by\r\n\r\nmilitary  government, as it, is the  right  of  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government to do as a sovereign power. But,\r\n\r\nif it is to be with our consent, if we are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpected  to  justify and defend this  Constitution\r\n\r\nand  work it, then we must believe that it is  fair\r\n\r\nand  just. If we are going to find our cream soaked\r\n\r\nup,  then I say that at the end of three years,  if\r\n\r\nnone of the houses go up, none of the factories  go\r\n\r\nup   to  give  jobs,  schools,  education  for  the\r\n\r\nchildren, jobs for the growing boys, then  you  can\r\n\r\nhave  all the army you like in the world,  but  you\r\n\r\ncannot  keep this place down. That is why we  fight\r\n\r\nfor  it  because we believe it is right  that  this\r\n\r\nplace  should  expand. If it expands because  of  a\r\n\r\ncommon  market  on terms which do not  destroy  our\r\n\r\nentrepot  trade, then it is our duty to share  that\r\n\r\nprosperity - additional    prosperity,    not    past\r\n\r\nprosperity;  not a $50 million grant. \"Grab\",  that\r\n\r\nwas the word used by the Member for Cairnhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have quite rightly kept the Federation\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister out of my discussions on  this  for\r\n\r\nspecific reasons, because I do not believe for  one\r\n\r\nmoment  that  it  is either his  intention  or  his\r\n\r\ndesire to depart from what has been agreed.  But  I\r\n\r\ndo  believe that the M.C.A. in Kuala Lumpur, one of\r\n\r\nthe   principal  associates  of  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  played politics and they  thought  that\r\n\r\nthis  was  a  clever way in which  they  could  fix\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 there will be elections. Everybody knows\r\n\r\nthat.  This  Assembly will have  run  out.  Between\r\n\r\nAugust  1963  and July 1964, if the funds  dry  up,\r\n\r\nthen  the election results can be fixed, like  they\r\n\r\nwere  in  Kelantan and Trengganu. You can dismantle\r\n\r\nthe  bridge halfway, pack it and bring it home; and\r\n\r\nthe  State Government can rusticate. But  that  was\r\n\r\nnot what we agreed. What we are fighting for is not\r\n\r\nfor  a  P.A.P.  Government but for  any  government\r\n\r\nelected  by  the people of Singapore. Whoever  wins\r\n\r\nthat  election  next year will find  in  the  kitty\r\n\r\nnearly  $400  million which was not there  when  we\r\n\r\ntook  office. That money will not disappear between\r\n\r\nnow  and  next  year.  Some will  be  expended - more\r\n\r\nhouses, schools and community centres  - but it  will\r\n\r\nbe  there. The reason why the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nfinds the ground cold  -  he keeps getting these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfainting  fits, and I was worried for him  when  he said  that \r\n\r\nhe was going to take a long  time  this evening - is  that there is \r\n\r\neuphoria on  the  ground.

But I say,  it  is our \r\n\r\nduty  to the people that we stand up to  self- made  Senators, and \r\n\r\nthat they understand the mettle of   Singapore,  that  whoever\r\n\r\nwants   to   govern Singapore must first understand the basic \r\n\r\nforces at work.  And the first basic force is that the Member for  \r\n\r\nQueenstown is just a little bit of ice on top of  an  iceberg,\r\n\r\na little bit of fluff. It  is  the iceberg    that    we    are   \r\n\r\nconcerned     with. [Interruption] - No  I have met the  iceberg,  and \r\n\r\nI have a healthy respect for it. They made very grave errors of\r\n\r\nmiscalculation, misjudgment, for which no doubt  they  will pay\r\n\r\nbitterly. They blotted  their copybook.

Tun Razak is in Manila.  He will \r\n\r\nbe back on Friday. My colleague, the Minister for  Finance, will have\r\n\r\nsent his reply  before  his return.  He  will be in Kuala Lumpur on \r\n\r\nMonday;  I hope  to  be there on Tuesday. By the end  of  next week \r\n\r\nwe may have to be in London. And I have  said this  publicly,  not \r\n\r\nbecause we like  to  bare  our chest  on these matters, that in \r\n\r\nSingapore  we  are accustomed  to  living  under  high  stresses \r\n\r\nand strains. And when Senators tell us that they intend to  go on\r\n\r\nwithout Singapore, and hope thereby  that we  will  succumb and our \r\n\r\nknees will buckle  in,  I think it is our duty to make it quite clear \r\n\r\nto them that,  grave as the consequences may be for all  of us, \r\n\r\nincluding ourselves as a Government and  as  a Party,  rather than \r\n\r\nbreach basic concord, we  would face  the awful consequences.\r\n\r\nFor them, once  again Pandora's  Box  is  open.

After  all,  we  have  15  seats   out   of\r\n\r\n159 - taxation  and representation  go  together.  We\r\n\r\nsaid  so.  And  therefore I ask  the  House,  fully\r\n\r\nconfident  that whatever the inner compunctions  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Cairnhill about what his principals\r\n\r\nwill  tell him, he will find it difficult  to  vote\r\n\r\nagainst  this  amendment to his motion.

We  are  against  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper  in principle. We know that  all  this\r\n\r\ntalk   about   so-called  financial   autonomy   is\r\n\r\nsomething like a farce. Therefore we would  abstain\r\n\r\non the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. has staged this drama of a fight for so-called autonomy in finance for reasons best known to itself. However, this drama is coming to a close although the final chapters are still not yet concluded. But the farce has been exposed and the plot to deceive the people\r\n\r\nunmasked,  and  the P.A.P. now lays bare  with  the\r\n\r\nnaked  truth  exposed. It finds that  it  has  been\r\n\r\ncornered   and  it  must  find  a  reasonable   and\r\n\r\nhonourable way out of its quandary. Sir, the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  took a very short Time to  bring  about\r\n\r\nits phoney sell-out merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He  is  out  of  order  by  using   that\r\n\r\nexpression.  Secondly, I cannot  see  how  that  is\r\n\r\nrelevant to the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am coming\r\n\r\nto  the explanation that this amendment is only  an\r\n\r\nattempt to hoodwink the people. By and by,  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, you will see from the White Paper that\r\n\r\nthe  broad principles of this so-called merger took\r\n\r\nsuch  a  short Time to draft out and formulate  and\r\n\r\nwhich  the P.A.P. Government accepted. We therefore\r\n\r\ncannot understand why it has taken so much time  to\r\n\r\nfinalise  one small item amongst tens of  items  in\r\n\r\nthe White Paper. We cannot understand what game the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is playing when it has sold out more  basic\r\n\r\nrights of the people of Singapore - for instance, the\r\n\r\ncitizenship  rights and our representation  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral Malaysian Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. Government claims that it is fighting for us to obtain financial control, financial autonomy and that the delay in the progress of the talks is due to the stumbling block from the Federation side. Whatever it is, Sir, from what we know, the words \"financial\r\n\r\nautonomy\"  were never mentioned at all  during  the\r\n\r\nreferendum, and they were first quoted by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister only in the Chinese Press during  a  visit\r\n\r\nto  Bukit  Panjang on Sunday, the 3rd March,  1963.\r\n\r\nNow, these words \"financial autonomy\" only appeared\r\n\r\nin  the Chinese Press, but in the English Press and\r\n\r\nin  official announcements in this House,  we  hear\r\n\r\nthe    words    \"financial    talks\",    \"financial\r\n\r\narrangements\",    \"negotiations    on     financial\r\n\r\narrangements\". In the Chinese Press, they  appeared\r\n\r\nas  \"financial autonomy\". We cannot understand  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of this double talk by the P.A.P. and  we\r\n\r\nmust clarify this to understand the motion. We know\r\n\r\nthat  the  Chinese Press is read  by  most  of  the\r\n\r\nvoters, three-quarters of whom are Chinese, and  it\r\n\r\nis  believed  that  most  of  the  leaders  of  the\r\n\r\nAlliance  Government read only the  English  Press.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, in the Nanyang Siang Pan on  4th\r\n\r\nMarch, 1963, there were headings in the paper which\r\n\r\nread - may I translate:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Prime Minister Lee makes speech in welcome party\r\n\r\nat  Mandai. \"After merger, this State of  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have autonomy in finance. Therefore, we  have\r\n\r\nonly 15 seats in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Central Parliament although Sabah and  Sarawak\r\n\r\ntogether have 40 seats. But finance comes under the\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Central Government.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, this theme of financial autonomy was played up\r\n\r\nby  the Chinese Press every Time the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nvisited  the  rural constituencies,  but  it  never\r\n\r\nappeared  in the English Press. When he  speaks  in\r\n\r\nMandarin   and  Hokkien,  he  speaks  of  financial\r\n\r\nautonomy. But when he speaks in other languages, we\r\n\r\nnever hear of financial autonomy but just financial\r\n\r\narrangements and financial negotiations. But,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  people  cannot be easily deceived.  They  know\r\n\r\nthat  all  this  talk of financial  autonomy  is  a\r\n\r\nbluff.  The  White  Paper has  stated  clearly  and\r\n\r\nplainly  under Item 7 of the Annexure that  out  of\r\n\r\nthe thirteen powers relating to finance, eleven are\r\n\r\ncompletely under Federal control and two items  are\r\n\r\nconcurrent  powers  which  mean  nothing  much   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Sir, where is the autonomy in  finance?\r\n\r\nThat  is why we cannot understand the delay in  the\r\n\r\ntalks  on  finance.  Under  the  White  Paper,  the\r\n\r\ncontrol of financial and monetary policies has been\r\n\r\ngiven   almost   completely   to   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment.  We  cannot  understand  what  is   the\r\n\r\nmeaning  Of  financial autonomy. Now, if  financial\r\n\r\nautonomy  means not the control of policies,  which\r\n\r\nbasic  right the P.A.P. Government has sold to  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government, but a difference of  pounds,\r\n\r\nshillings and pence, of dollars and cents,  then  I\r\n\r\nwish to remind the Minister for Finance of a speech\r\n\r\nhe  made  at  the Singapore Airport on 16th  April,\r\n\r\n1963,  contained  in  the Sin  Chew  lit  Poh.  The\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, returning after a meeting  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur, said, \"Between friendly states  what\r\n\r\nis  a  few  million dollars?\" Sir, if that  is  the\r\n\r\ngenuine difference between the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation Government,  then  we  do  not\r\n\r\nunderstand why there should be delay in the  talks,\r\n\r\nunless   it   is   meant   for   the   purpose   of\r\n\r\nelectioneering,  for  capturing   votes   and   for\r\n\r\noutmanoeuvring the S.P.A. Alliance in  winning  the\r\n\r\nvotes of the bankers, the insurance companies,  the\r\n\r\nbig  bosses  in  town, the colonial  merchants  and\r\n\r\nfirms and industrialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the statement made today by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said that there had been no agreement  or\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore and the Federation Governments\r\n\r\ncould  reach no agreement on two matters;  firstly,\r\n\r\nthe apportionment of expenditure and the quantum of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  contribution for Federal  expenditure;\r\n\r\nand  secondly,  responsibility  for  collection  of\r\n\r\nnational taxes in Singapore after merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this was the position on the 28th of February,\r\n\r\n1963,  and is the position, as far as I know,  now.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is the position, then the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nmust  have  been  guilty of deceiving  the  people,\r\n\r\nbecause a few days after that, during his visit  to\r\n\r\nBukit Panjang constituency, he said this and it was\r\n\r\nin  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh of 4th March,  1963.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  on and again in many of his speeches on  that\r\n\r\nday,  which  was  only three days after  the  First\r\n\r\nSession  of the Inter-Governmental Committee,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government had  agreed  after  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  Malaysia  that  Singapore  would\r\n\r\ncollect  its  own  taxes.  Other  than  fairly  and\r\n\r\nreasonably   allocating  a  part  to  the   Central\r\n\r\nGovernment   for  defence,  external  affairs   and\r\n\r\ninternal  security, the balance would remain  under\r\n\r\nthe  control of Singapore. If you will  excuse  me,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, I repeat the words  in  Chinese\r\n\r\nwhich  he said himself, \"Ta mah chern lee  ho  lian\r\n\r\nher pang chern pooh ee tong yee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

On  the same day, he  said,  \"If  our\r\n\r\nfinance  is controlled by the Federation,  we  must\r\n\r\nlisten  to them. The White Paper has stated clearly\r\n\r\nthat  we run our own finance; each year we  give  a\r\n\r\nquarter of our revenue to the Federation Government\r\n\r\nso  that  they  can run external affairs,  defence,\r\n\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, either the statement given to the House by the Prime Minister contains errors in facts, or the speech made by the Prime Minister at Bukit Panjang on the 3rd of March, 1963, was deceiving, because, according to the statement today, no decision had been reached at that Time\r\n\r\neither on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility for the collection of  taxes  or  on\r\n\r\nthe apportionment of expenditure and the quantum of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  contribution for Federal  expenditure.\r\n\r\nSir, this is another example of the P.A.P.'s double\r\n\r\ntalk.  Who  can  trust  the P.A.P.  Government  any\r\n\r\nlonger? So, now the P.A.P., having played out  this\r\n\r\nepisode  of  so-called autonomy in  finance,  found\r\n\r\nitself  in  a  quandary and  the  whole  thing  has\r\n\r\nboomeranged against it. It has already gone back to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation compromised on the  issue,  and  in\r\n\r\norder to cover up its sins, it has tried to deceive\r\n\r\nus  by another method by saying that it has reached\r\n\r\nagreement   in   principle  with   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment on this so-called common market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, unless and until the P.A.P. Government\r\n\r\nannounce  the  details of the common market,  which\r\n\r\nthey say have been agreed in principle, we are  not\r\n\r\nsure  whether it is another sell-out of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment. Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said at the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  the  speech,  today's  exercise   in\r\n\r\npushing item 20 from the bottom of the agenda paper\r\n\r\nto  the  top  is nothing but a test of intellectual\r\n\r\ncapacity between the S.P.A. leaders and the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders and to see who will come out best from this\r\n\r\nexercise.  Therefore, on this  motion  and  on  the\r\n\r\namendment, we will abstain because in principle  we\r\n\r\noppose the White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tun Lim, on the amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one can excuse\r\n\r\nthe Member for Hong Lim for feeling that there is a\r\n\r\ngame  being played by the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. on\r\n\r\nthis  vital national issue concerning the lives  of\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore. I can understand  why  he\r\n\r\ntakes  that line. It is because the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nin his speech tried also to play a game of politics\r\n\r\nwith  us.  He  asks,  what kind  of  tactics  am  I\r\n\r\nindulging in? He thinks that by amending the motion\r\n\r\nhe  has got me where he wants me. Let me assure him\r\n\r\nin  this House that the motion I put in is aimed at\r\n\r\ntelling  him  that the way he has been going  about\r\n\r\nthings is wrong and has caused concern. He wants us\r\n\r\nnow  to give him added strength in his negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the  Federation Government.  Let  me  at  the\r\n\r\noutset say this to him. The interests\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore come first, and so long\r\n\r\nas  the  Government is guided by that principle  in\r\n\r\nits negotiations with the Federation Government, we\r\n\r\nare  with  it  and  to that extent  we  accept  its\r\n\r\namendment.  But what we resent and resent  strongly\r\n\r\nis  the  way he tries to sneer at us. He  tries  to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that we are the agents of our principal\r\n\r\nin  Kuala Lumpur. What is he trying to say?  We  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are autonomous insofar as the  interests\r\n\r\nof the people of Singapore are concerned, but where\r\n\r\nit  concerns the whole of Malaysia, it will he  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Grand Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the tone of the speech of the Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nit  would  seem that he would feel very  happy  and\r\n\r\nstrengthened  in his resolve if we would  give  him\r\n\r\nsupport  on  this  amendment. It  is  just  like  a\r\n\r\nconfession  that he has been having  heavy  weather\r\n\r\nand  that heavy weather was as a result of the  way\r\n\r\nhe went about these negotiations. If he had gone on\r\n\r\nthe   right   lines  talking  to   the   Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  in  a sober and dignified  manner,  all\r\n\r\nthis  would  not have come up in public  and  there\r\n\r\nneed  not  have to he this motion before the  House\r\n\r\nthis  evening.  But no, he wants to  play  politics\r\n\r\nP.A.P. style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While supporting him on that amendment, we want\r\n\r\nthe  Government to understand this, that we do  not\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Prime Minister in his antics  in  the\r\n\r\nPress  nor in his antics during his visits  to  the\r\n\r\nrural  constituencies. We want him to be  a  sober-minded  responsible Prime Minister going  to  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  to  discuss  the  terms  of  the  financial\r\n\r\narrangements  in  a manner that  is  befitting  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of the State of Singapore. We  hope\r\n\r\nthat  in giving this moral strength to him,  as  we\r\n\r\nhave  been giving moral strength to the P.A.P. even\r\n\r\nbefore  the P.A.P. came to power, if we can  inject\r\n\r\ninto  the Government some moral strength to  enable\r\n\r\nthem to present the case of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nmore effectively, we are always prepared to do  so.\r\n\r\nI  must  repeat, Sir, that the Prime Minister  must\r\n\r\nnot  make  use  of  our support  to  indulge  in  a\r\n\r\npolitical  game. He must play it fair  and  square,\r\n\r\notherwise he will have to give an account to us  in\r\n\r\nthis Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister was carried away in his\r\n\r\nspeech  just now and he retorted to an interjection\r\n\r\nby the Member for Queenstown. This is what he said,\r\n\r\n\"It  is within the power of the Opposition to bring\r\n\r\nthe  Government down.\" Sure it is within the  power\r\n\r\nof the Opposition, but as is typical of the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. would not pair off with the Member  for\r\n\r\nBras Basah who is indisposed. I would then ask  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister if he really means business - give  a\r\n\r\npairing off to the Member for Bras Basah and let us\r\n\r\nsee whether the Prime Minister will stand up to his\r\n\r\nbrave words in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why we give this support to the\r\n\r\namendment is that we feel that the interest of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore must come first. But we are,  I\r\n\r\nmust  confess,  very concerned  that  this  support\r\n\r\nwhich we solemnly give them in this House would  be\r\n\r\nmanoeuvred  by them for their own ends.  The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  capable of this. Even in this  House,\r\n\r\nwhere  truth must he said, the Prime Minister  said\r\n\r\nthis  in reply to what I said earlier in my speech,\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister did not attend a meeting of\r\n\r\nthe  Inter-Governmental Committee because he played\r\n\r\ngolf and said that he was too tired. And the clever\r\n\r\npropagandist in the Prime Minister came  up  saying\r\n\r\nthat at one particular Time he considered it to  be\r\n\r\nk the interest of the people that he did not attend\r\n\r\nthe  meeting in Kuala Lumpur and chose to  stay  in\r\n\r\nCameron  Highlands golfing with the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nLook   at  that.  The  people  who  know  the  true\r\n\r\nsituation can nail him in his distortion.  The  day\r\n\r\nhe  was in Cameron Highlands, so was I. He did  not\r\n\r\nattend the meeting in Kuala Lumpur when the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  did,  because he agreed  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister of the Federation of Malaya that no useful\r\n\r\npurpose  could be served for a meeting to be  held.\r\n\r\nHe  tried to say that he did not attend because  it\r\n\r\nwas in the interest of the people of Singapore, and\r\n\r\nso  he went out golfing. What kind of distortion is\r\n\r\nhe  trying to indulge in in this House? Let us  not\r\n\r\nplay  that  kind of a game. I would urge the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  Government always  to  remember\r\n\r\nthis,  in  this solemn hour, with 31st August  just\r\n\r\naround the corner - play the game straight, play  the\r\n\r\ngame  clean, play the game without trying  to  gain\r\n\r\npolitical\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncredit for the general elections  that  will\r\n\r\ntake  place next year. If they will just  do  that,\r\n\r\nthey   will   have  us  with  them  in  all   their\r\n\r\ndiscussions with the Federation Government. This is\r\n\r\ntypical  of  the culture of the P.A.P.,  that  they\r\n\r\nwant our support and yet they ridicule us. They say\r\n\r\nwe  are the agents, we always dance to the crack of\r\n\r\nthe  principals.  But let me tell them  here - repeat\r\n\r\nthis  here - that  as  far as Singapore  politics  is\r\n\r\nconcerned, we are free to look after the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in the context of Malaysia, and  if  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.

The Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  plays very tough these days. He wants  to\r\n\r\ngive  an appearance to the people of Singapore that\r\n\r\nhe  is really holding on, fighting for the interest\r\n\r\nof  the people of Singapore. But who does not  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. has  always  been  fighting  for\r\n\r\npersonal  and selfish interest? The Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nhas   referred  to  my  telegram  to  the   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters'  conference  at  Manila.  He  says,  \"Of\r\n\r\ncourse, we cannot stop Malaysia.\" But the point  is\r\n\r\nthis,  the P.A.P. today plays tough for one special\r\n\r\nreason.  It  is  not because the  P.A.P.  Ministers\r\n\r\nreally  have the interest of the people  at  heart,\r\n\r\nbut because they know that there are hitches in the\r\n\r\nformation of Malaysia. The fact that the Tunku  had\r\n\r\nto  go to Tokyo and that there are Ministers now in\r\n\r\nManila  show  that there are a lot of hitches.  The\r\n\r\nnewspapers  have already suggested  that  there  is\r\n\r\nevery  possibility,  and a very strong  possibility\r\n\r\ntoo, that Malaysia cannot be formed in time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

There  are, it seems to  me,  two  very\r\n\r\nstrong impressions that persist in the minds of the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. I am sorry  that  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  is  not  here, but  I  hope  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister will give the answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of dates is important. On\r\n\r\nSaturday, 13th April, when the Prime Minister  told\r\n\r\nthe  Press that there was a merger crisis and  that\r\n\r\nanything  could happen, could the Finance  Minister\r\n\r\nplease enlighten us on these two points?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, whether on that date agreement had\r\n\r\nalready been reached that surpluses accumulated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  before 31st August, 1963, would  not  be\r\n\r\ntouched  by the Federation? Sir, this is  important\r\n\r\nbecause  the  impression gained by  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore arising from Press reports was  that  the\r\n\r\nFederation  was  going  to  raid  the  pre-Malaysia\r\n\r\nsurpluses  which  have  been  accumulated  by   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government for development purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second wrong impression, it seems to me, is\r\n\r\nthat on that date when the Prime Minister made  his\r\n\r\nPress  statement,  the  Federation  Government  was\r\n\r\nstill trying to get agreement with Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat they should control the Federal  revenue\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore and keep it in Kuala Lumpur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two impressions are very important\r\n\r\nbecause unless they are clarified they will cause a\r\n\r\ngreat  deal of misunderstanding. When we  heard  of\r\n\r\nthese  impressions, we realised that,  as  a  Party\r\n\r\nthat  stands for the people of Singapore, it  would\r\n\r\nbe difficult for us to agree to this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, some of us went to Kuala Lumpur to  seek\r\n\r\npersonal clarification. There we were told on  28th\r\n\r\nApril, I think ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> By whom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- that there had already been\r\n\r\nagreement   that   the  surpluses  accumulated   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  before 31st August, 1963, would  not  be\r\n\r\ninterfered  with  by the Federation,  and  that  if\r\n\r\nthere was any impression that had been given to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  to the contrary,  then  that\r\n\r\nimpression was wrong. Further, the national revenue\r\n\r\ncollected in Singapore and reported to be deposited\r\n\r\nin  Kuala  Lumpur would be deposited in  a  neutral\r\n\r\npool  in Singapore. Sir, if what we learnt in Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur  was  correct,  then somehow  or  other  the\r\n\r\nimpressions   given  through  the   newspapers   in\r\n\r\nSingapore to the people of Singapore were wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am now quoting from the Straits Times of\r\n\r\nTuesday, 16th April, 1963 - on page 1, col.  1:  Here\r\n\r\nis the text of Tun Razak's statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As Chairman of the Inter-Governmental Committee\r\n\r\non  Merger  of  Singapore with  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya,  I  have kept quiet for the last  two  days\r\n\r\nbecause it has been the agreed practice that at the\r\n\r\nend  of  a  conference we issue a  joint  statement\r\n\r\nagreed  by both parties and neither side makes  any\r\n\r\nfurther statement to the Press. However, since  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister of Singapore had made a  number  of\r\n\r\nstatements  in  the  Press  which  were  not  quite\r\n\r\naccurate, I feel it is my duty to put things  right\r\n\r\nin order to avoid any wrong impression of what took\r\n\r\nplace at the Inter-Governmental Committee talks.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he went on further:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Singapore Government, in an official\r\n\r\nstatement,   has   now  practically   accused   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Minister  of Finance,  which  means  in\r\n\r\neffect the Federation Government, of trying  to  go\r\n\r\nback on the Singapore White Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  completely untrue,  and  it  is  not  the\r\n\r\npractice of the Federation Government to go back on\r\n\r\nits word, written or unwritten.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then he went on:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`\"I regret very much the attitude taken by Mr\r\n\r\nLee.

But what we would  like\r\n\r\nto  have  clarified, Sir, on the date  quoted  13th\r\n\r\nApril,  was it a fact or not a fact that there  had\r\n\r\nalready   been   agreement   that   the   surpluses\r\n\r\naccumulated before Malaysia would not be touched by\r\n\r\nthe Federation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It seems to be irrelevant, but if the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance wishes to answer, he  can  do\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at this late\r\n\r\ntime  of  the night after a very busy  day  at  the\r\n\r\noffice,  I may be excused if I find some difficulty\r\n\r\nin  giving all the details asked for by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wants to know, if I understood him right,\r\n\r\nwhether  on  Saturday, 13th April, there  had  been\r\n\r\nagreement   between   the  two   Governments   that\r\n\r\nsurpluses accumulated before ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> 31st August, 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> --- surpluses accumulated before\r\n\r\nmerger   day  would  not  be  taken  over  by   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. The  answer  is  that  this\r\n\r\npoint  never arose at all. The point is  completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant. I remember seeing something  like  this\r\n\r\nin  the  newspaper,  but the  point  is  completely\r\n\r\nirrelevant,  because  if it means  that  they  will\r\n\r\nshare our accumulated surpluses, then it means that\r\n\r\nwe  have to pay out of our reserves. That was never\r\n\r\ndiscussed,   never  thought  of,  either   by   the\r\n\r\nFederation Government or our Government. But if the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin will look at  page  5  of  the\r\n\r\nstatement made by the Prime Minister, in  fact  the\r\n\r\nlast line says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore retains half her surplus, based on 1961\r\n\r\ncalculations, instead of surrendering the whole.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That  was  the proposition discussed at the  Inter-Governmental  Committee on the  10th  and  11th  of\r\n\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Subsequent surpluses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, in other words, they\r\n\r\nwanted  subsequent surpluses.
