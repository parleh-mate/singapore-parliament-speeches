I rise in support of the  motion  in  the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Finance, Dr Richard Hu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has already been said on how to make our\r\n\r\neconomy  strong  and competitive. After all,  the  Budget  is\r\n\r\nabout the economics of governing Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr Inderjit Singh's magic of doing business\r\n\r\nthrough  the  Internet is fascinating,  I  am  glad  that  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan  has  reminded us of  the  concerns  about  the\r\n\r\ndigital divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this context that I find Dr Hu ending his\r\n\r\nremarks  on the Budget Statement with a sober reminder  about\r\n\r\nthe  importance  of  social cohesion as interesting,  if  not\r\n\r\ntelling. I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Most important of all, we have to work on preserving\r\n\r\nour social cohesion, without which we will be much weaker  as\r\n\r\na nation in weathering a future crisis.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\nPerhaps a coincidence, or perhaps to buttress the point,  the\r\n\r\nStraits Times released, a day after Budget Day, survey\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresults  on  ethnic  relations which  say  a  lot  about  our\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities   as   a  multi-racial  and   multi-religious\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Sir, I would not bore you with more rhetorics about\r\n\r\nwhy we must not get complacent about race relations and multi-racial harmony, but suffice to say that those survey findings\r\n\r\nshould  serve as a wake up call for us that all is  not  well\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Sir, I can see the progress we have made. But\r\n\r\nthere  is still a lot of ground to be covered before  we  can\r\n\r\nreally  say  that  we are truly race and colour  blind.   The\r\n\r\nsurvey results proved this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the survey results could have been more positive\r\n\r\nif  it  were  carried  out in better times,  when  Singapore-Malaysia  relations were warmer.  The letter by  a  Malaysian\r\n\r\nMalay,  Malik Tahir, published in the Straits Times,  looking\r\n\r\nat Malaysia-Singapore relations from the point of view of the\r\n\r\nso-called  abang-adik, or big brother and small brother,  and\r\n\r\nethnic Malay-Chinese angle, would not help.  So with the  May\r\n\r\n1997  anti-Chinese  riots in Indonesia and  the  off  and  on\r\n\r\nChristian-Muslim killings in  Maluku.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, all the more we need to continue to work hard at\r\n\r\nimproving  race  relations in Singapore.   Whether  it  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of promoting understanding and even more difficult,\r\n\r\nto build better trust, something that will take a longer time\r\n\r\nto achieve, we have to soldier on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to share with you a conversation I had with my\r\n\r\nson,  an  officer in the army.  He was of course appalled  at\r\n\r\nthe  survey results.  He was saddened that about 60% believed\r\n\r\nthat  there  was a need to check the background  of  a  Malay\r\n\r\nofficer  before putting him in an important position  in  the\r\n\r\nSAF.  He protested pointedly - I quote: \"Put yourself in  the\r\n\r\nposition  where you are putting your best foot  forward,  you\r\n\r\nare  all hearts and soul to serve the SAF and Singapore,  how\r\n\r\nwould you feel about such survey findings?\" - when responding\r\n\r\nto  the survey finding about the question of whether to trust\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMalays in times of war with a Malay/Muslim country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comforted himself by saying that perhaps the survey\r\n\r\ncould  be seen academically.  \"What matters\", he said,   \"are\r\n\r\npractical  situations.\"  He was confident that his men,  whom\r\n\r\nhe  served  NS with, would feel differently.  Having  trained\r\n\r\nand served together under NS would have made that difference.\r\n\r\nHe  feels  that  whatever the feelings shown in  the  survey,\r\n\r\nprimordial  or otherwise, we must continue to develop  better\r\n\r\nbonding and better trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share that sentiment. We have no choice. When\r\n\r\nwe  believe  in  our Singapore, we have to  soldier  on  with\r\n\r\nbetter  bonding.  We must continue to work hard at  nurturing\r\n\r\nbetter  understanding and trust.  That may sound  rhetorical,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is  no other way.  We all know, of  course,  that\r\n\r\nslogans and speeches are not enough.  Each one of us has  got\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility and a role to play.  Let  us  spread  the\r\n\r\ngospel of harmonious living as wide as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in developing Singapore, Dr Hu said in\r\n\r\nhis   Budget  Speech  that  the  challenge  is  for  us   \"to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate ourselves by finding creative ways to add value\r\n\r\nto our infrastructure.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu cited the development of Jurong Island as one\r\n\r\nexample  of  that  creativity.   He said,  \"Amalgamated  from\r\n\r\nseven   offshore islands, Jurong Island is to become a world-class  integrated chemical hub, the first of its kind in  the\r\n\r\nregion.\"   Such  is  also our challenge for social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nLet  us  \"amalgamate\" our different races together,  wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  into one main Singapore race.  There is definitely\r\n\r\nmore room for better racial and social chemistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Hu went on to say that Jurong Island, \"Through\r\n\r\nclustering and sharing of common facilities, it will generate\r\n\r\nsynergistic  linkages across a wide spectrum of petrochemical\r\n\r\nindustries.\"   He  said,  \"For  example,  the  provision   of\r\n\r\ncentralised logistics and common corridors for material flows\r\n\r\nwill   significantly  reduce  feedstock  transportation   and\r\n\r\nhandling cost.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should try to transplant those same concepts in\r\n\r\nforging  multi-racial harmony.  We will need to see a greater\r\n\r\nsharing of common efforts that will not only generate synergy\r\n\r\nbut also open new highways of opportunities for the different\r\n\r\nethnic  groups to integrate.  This way, we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nreduce the constant heartaches that every so often show their\r\n\r\nugly  heads.  The political cost of racial discord could also\r\n\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein of the formation of JurongIsland.com,\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  Dr Hu in his Budget Statement,  let  us  build\r\n\r\nHarmonyIsland.com, either under the Prime  Minister's  Office\r\n\r\nor  the Ministry of Community Development, to help us open  a\r\n\r\nnew  corridor  to a more harmonious living in our  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLet  this  HarmonyIsland.com be far more meaningful than  the\r\n\r\ncommercial Orchard.com, for it will encompass the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nChinatown.com,   Geylang.com,   LittleIndia.com   and    even\r\n\r\nKatong.com.  And, in short, making the true spirit of  multi-racial  Singapore come to life through the magic of  Internet\r\n\r\nand IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should apply the same zeal and creativity that we\r\n\r\noften exercise for our economic achievements to our effort at\r\n\r\nensuring racial and religious harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim community recognises the dangers of a\r\n\r\npossible  digital  divide.   They  have  embarked  on  a  KBE\r\n\r\nmovement launched by the Prime Minister last December to help\r\n\r\nthe community equip itself with the right skills, in order to\r\n\r\nplay its part in competitive and global Singapore. Obviously,\r\n\r\nthis is just a beginning, a modest start.  More will have  to\r\n\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay/Muslim organisations will have to speed up its\r\n\r\nmomentum   in  this  area,  work  in  tandem  with   national\r\n\r\nprogrammes and Government agencies to keep abreast  with  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of  the  digital  race.  Government  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nagencies  too  should  help  complement  and  supplement  the\r\n\r\nefforts by the Malay/Muslim community towards this end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the community continues to work hard to tackle its\r\n\r\nlingering problems in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation  and  socio-economic realms, neither the  community\r\n\r\nnor  Singapore can afford another divide to emerge  from  the\r\n\r\ndigital era.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I trust Dr Hu will say \"yes\" to\r\n\r\nHarmonyIsland.com, to help promote better racial  harmony  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and alleviate the potential divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  on  behalf  of  the  business  community   in\r\n\r\nSingapore, I would like to thank the Government for its  able\r\n\r\nleadership  in  strongly advocating  the  tripartism  of  the\r\n\r\nlabour,  management  and the Government to  adopt  the  cost-cutting  package  to  deal with the Asian  financial  crisis,\r\n\r\nenabling  Singapore's economy to recover steadily  last  year\r\n\r\nand achieving  a 5.4% growth for the whole year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after having gone through this financial crisis, I\r\n\r\ndeeply  appreciate the spiritual strength  of  tripartism  of\r\n\r\nlabour,  management  and  the  Government  which  is  a  pre-requisite  for  Singapore's economy  to  develop  and  remain\r\n\r\nstable  in  the  face of chaos.  We must carry  forward  this\r\n\r\nspirit of tripartism  at all costs.  In view of this, I  must\r\n\r\npresent  for  discussion  in this  House  the  views  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community on the way the Government dealt with  the\r\n\r\ncost-cutting  package  and the huge budget  surplus  achieved\r\n\r\nlast  year, with the hope that the Government would  continue\r\n\r\nto  conform to the wishes of the people and adopt appropriate\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  enhance the business community's confidence  in\r\n\r\nthe labour-management-Government tripartite strategy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because of the economic recovery in FY 1999, we\r\n\r\nwere  able  to  turn  deficits into  surplus,  enabling  most\r\n\r\nworkers to retain their jobs and many enterprises to survive.\r\n\r\nIt  can  be  said to be happiness all round.   However,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans told me that the Government could be said to  be\r\n\r\nthe   biggest   winner  in  the  financial  bumper   harvest.\r\n\r\nAccording  to the Finance Minister, last year's revenue  from\r\n\r\nCOEs and income tax was much more than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npredicted.   On  the  other  hand,  tender  prices  for   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  development projects were substantially  lower.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Government had also shelved some of the\r\n\r\nless  important development plans, thereby saving some  hefty\r\n\r\nsums  of  expenditure for the Government.  As such, not  only\r\n\r\nhas  the Government not injected the $5.1 billion as promised\r\n\r\ninto  the economy, but it received a bumper surplus  of  $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the business community's point of view, the surplus\r\n\r\nobtained  by the Government  on this occasion could not  help\r\n\r\nbut  give people the feeling of \"robbing Peter to pay  Paul\".\r\n\r\nThose  in the construction industry are particularly unhappy.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  serious  impact of  the  financial  crisis,\r\n\r\ncoupled with intense competition, building contractors had to\r\n\r\nresort  to  bidding  below  cost for  the  limited  contracts\r\n\r\noffered by the Government, in order to survive and to  retain\r\n\r\ntheir  staff  and  workers,  much  to  the  benefit  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big and small building contractors in Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  be  said  to be in a sorry plight in  the  process  of\r\n\r\ndealing with the impact of the financial storm.  They had not\r\n\r\nonly  to  try  and save the industry which seemed  unable  to\r\n\r\nrecover after a setback, through self-sacrifice, but also  to\r\n\r\ntry  their  best  to keep the rice-bowls of their  employees.\r\n\r\nThis is something that warrants our attention. Moreover,  the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry has all along been an important link in\r\n\r\nour  economy, and cannot be neglected.  As such, I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to  bring forward as soon  as  possible  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects  which  it  had  shelved  so  that  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry can restore its vitality  earlier  and\r\n\r\ncatch up with the other sectors of our economy on the road to\r\n\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in actual fact, the difference between the $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion  FY 1999 budget surplus achieved and the $5.1 billion\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit  predicted was really  tremendous.   This  is\r\n\r\nincredible!  Many Singaporeans could not help asking: Has the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment been over cautious in formulating and implementing\r\n\r\nthe  cost-cutting  package introduced  by the  Government  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  people tide over the financial crisis? Or  was  it\r\n\r\nbecause the Government had been  half-hearted in its efforts,\r\n\r\nresulting  in  it  being unable to produce  better  and  more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  results?   Perhaps  the  Government  was   not\r\n\r\npractising  what it preached when it advocated the tripartism\r\n\r\nof  labour, management and Government.  Furthermore,  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment planning to conduct a full review on the manner in\r\n\r\nwhich  it  formulates the annual Budget to avoid a repetition\r\n\r\nof  such  a  huge gap in the estimates which sends the  wrong\r\n\r\nsignal  to  the  business community and causes  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity   to  lose  faith  in  the  Government's   economic\r\n\r\nstrategies?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally, enterprises must have rich financial\r\n\r\nresources   to survive, develop and undertake risks  involved\r\n\r\nwith  exploiting innovative business.  At this time when  our\r\n\r\neconomy  has  just  recovered  from  the  recession  and  the\r\n\r\nsituation of our neighbouring economies is still not certain,\r\n\r\nmost  enterprises would need to accumulate more reserves from\r\n\r\ntheir operating surpluses for contingency use, just like  any\r\n\r\ngovernment.   However, it is regrettable that our  Government\r\n\r\nseems  to  be in a great hurry to withdraw the 10% rebate  on\r\n\r\ncorporate tax from this year's Budget. At the same time,  the\r\n\r\nproperty tax rebate on industrial properties is reduced  from\r\n\r\n55% to 25%.  Although the Government announced a reduction of\r\n\r\n0.5 percentage point in the corporate tax rate to 25.5%, this\r\n\r\nwill not take effect until next year.   Generally, the people\r\n\r\nwill  find such lack of generosity  difficult to accept.   No\r\n\r\nwonder  some  businessmen are now asking: \"Is the  Government\r\n\r\nsincere in wanting to share the happiness and bitterness with\r\n\r\nthe  business community?  Why is the Government  not  sharing\r\n\r\nthe  fruits of the economic recovery with them in  line  with\r\n\r\nthe spirit of tripartism?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we are strongly encouraging our businessmen to\r\n\r\nbe  adventurous in opening up new markets and developing  new\r\n\r\nproducts,  we should appreciate that these businessmen are in\r\n\r\ndire need of more surpluses and capital to back them up in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\norder  to  accept the challenges.   As such, I hope that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  further reduce more taxes  to  enable  our\r\n\r\nenterprises to enhance their competitiveness, and strive  for\r\n\r\nmore  operating  surpluses and accumulate enough  capital  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  their business.  In this respect, I would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to grant our local enterprises, particularly  the\r\n\r\nnewly  established  SMEs, special tax  concessions,  such  as\r\n\r\nallowing  them reliefs from their taxable income, similar  to\r\n\r\nthe    personal   reliefs   in   individual    income    tax.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the SMEs could be allowed to pay their  income\r\n\r\ntax on a progressive scale to alleviate their tax burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend the Government for allocating funds to\r\n\r\nthe  Medifund, the ElderCare Fund, and the top-up of $250  to\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary accounts of the CPF members, so that our people\r\n\r\nwould  get  to share as much as $685 million from the  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  of  YA1999.  However, compared to the  $3.2  billion\r\n\r\nsurplus, this amount is still relatively small.  Perhaps, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  consider allocating some  funds  from  the\r\n\r\nsurplus  to  finance  the various industrial  and  commercial\r\n\r\norganisations  so  that  they could  conduct  various  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  activities and training programmes for workers  in\r\n\r\nthe various trades and industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we notice that in the new fiscal year, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be allocating $3.3 billion  to  the  public\r\n\r\nservice  for manpower expenditure, an increase of as high  as\r\n\r\n10.8%.  Yet, the Government is forecasting an economic growth\r\n\r\nof  only  4.5%  to 6.5% for this year.  As we all  know,  any\r\n\r\nincrease in salaries in the public sector would bring about a\r\n\r\nvicious  cycle in the other sectors of the economy, resulting\r\n\r\nin  an  unconstrained escalation in wage cost  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nNow,  the private sector is trying to exercise wage restraint\r\n\r\nto  cut down business cost, but the public sector persists in\r\n\r\nits argument of having to attract talents and keeps on making\r\n\r\nsubstantial  upward  adjustments  to  wages.   Is  this   not\r\n\r\ncontrary  to  the  cooperative spirit of our  tripartism?  As\r\n\r\nsuch, I would urge the Government to exercise extreme caution\r\n\r\nwhenever  it  raises the salaries in the  public  sector,  to\r\n\r\navoid accelerated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nescalation  in  business  cost   and   the  burden   on   the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget for the new century is of utmost\r\n\r\nimportance to our development.  It is the motivating force to\r\n\r\nmove  us into the knowledge-based economy.  I am very pleased\r\n\r\nwith  the  Government  for all its efforts  in  this  aspect.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  must always take note that in  this  globalised\r\n\r\neconomy  and era of information technology,  we are bound  to\r\n\r\nface  some  rapidly changing situations.   I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   will  continue  with  its  style  of    adopting\r\n\r\nappropriately to changes  and conforming to the wishes of the\r\n\r\npeople.    Whenever  necessary,  the  Government  should   be\r\n\r\nresolute  in  making  prompt  decisions  and  adopt  suitable\r\n\r\nmeasures to lead the people in the spirit of our tripatism to\r\n\r\ncounter  the challenges of the new century and move into  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy for our future development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, Sir, we must thank and congratulate\r\n\r\nour  Government for its outstanding management and leadership\r\n\r\nin  pulling  Singapore out of its worst economic crisis  that\r\n\r\nhit this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one, Sir, can deny that the Government has done well\r\n\r\nindeed  for  the people and for the country.   In  comparison\r\n\r\nwith  other governments, this Government stands up and stands\r\n\r\ntall,   as  one  with  the  vision,  the  courage   and   the\r\n\r\ndetermination to see us through to the promised land, and  to\r\n\r\nbring us to new heights in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we were surprised the other day to hear\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Minister for Finance that for the  last  financial\r\n\r\nyear,  instead  of  the  projected $5  billion  deficit,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has turned in an estimated $3.2 billion  surplus.\r\n\r\nAny  surplus  is good and most welcome.  But the question  in\r\n\r\nour  mind  is:  had the Government been overly  cautious  and\r\n\r\nextraordinarily  conservative in holding  back  expenditures?\r\n\r\nHad  the  Government not held back so much and released  more\r\n\r\nfunds into the economy, would there not have been a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngreater multiplier impact and faster recovery of the economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Government has quickly cut and reduced some of\r\n\r\nthe  rebates,  and increased significantly, for example,  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  charges for properties.  Are these  actions  too\r\n\r\ndrastic  and  too  soon?  Will they lead to other  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and agencies raising their charges quickly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pendulum must not swing the other way too quickly,\r\n\r\notherwise  business costs will rise sharply,  and  that  will\r\n\r\nhurt  the competitiveness of our economy and our own country.\r\n\r\nWe  should  give  more time for companies to restructure  and\r\n\r\nconsolidate.  Do not forget, ultimately, we have  to  compete\r\n\r\nagainst other regional economies, like Hong Kong, Taiwan  and\r\n\r\nThailand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am glad that the Government is taking good\r\n\r\ncare  of  the man-in-the-street, with rental rebates, rebates\r\n\r\nfor  S&C  charges and utilities rebates, and the  CPF  top-up\r\n\r\nscheme.   This shows that the Government has a heart for  our\r\n\r\nheartlanders,  and  appreciates the sacrifices  made  by  the\r\n\r\npeople in taking pay and CPF cuts in difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this budget, we are spending the lion's share on\r\n\r\neducation.  This is the right move.  People are our precious,\r\n\r\nand  only  resources, more so in the knowledge-based economy,\r\n\r\nthe very foundation of our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we invest so much on education, will it not be\r\n\r\nwise  for us to do a strategic review of education, a  stock-taking and seeking new directions in the new economy, in  the\r\n\r\nnew  world  of  the Internet, wired together  in  one  global\r\n\r\nvillage?  I ask this as it is clear that the pace  of  change\r\n\r\nhas  quickened,  and the momentum may be  overwhelming.   Old\r\n\r\nmethods  and old ways of teaching, for example,  may  not  be\r\n\r\nrelevant  any more.  It is an IT world, yet many  schools,  I\r\n\r\nobserve,  are still mainly using the blackboard,  the  duster\r\n\r\nand chalk.  The classroom need not be square, with tables and\r\n\r\nchairs all facing the same\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndirection towards the blackboard.  We should use more  IT  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools  and in teaching. This will make  learning  more\r\n\r\nfun.   And  how  do we impart good moral values or  highlight\r\n\r\ncharacter development when students and schools are bent  and\r\n\r\npreoccupied with examination grades.  Examination grades  are\r\n\r\nimportant, but not everything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we bogging down our students with too many facts and\r\n\r\nfigures  that  they  do  not  have  the  time  to  think  for\r\n\r\nthemselves? Is it stifling initiative and creativity?  Are we\r\n\r\nproducing a generation that is averse to risk-taking, that is\r\n\r\nso kiasu?  This is a pertinent question as Singapore enters a\r\n\r\nnew phase of development in the new economy, which beckons us\r\n\r\nwith   opportunities  and  challenges  of   risk-taking,   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, of going global, and of daring to do.   But\r\n\r\nis  our education system preparing our young to take on these\r\n\r\nchallenges in the new economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they taught the right skills in our schools? Are\r\n\r\nour  young well prepared for life in the outside world?   Are\r\n\r\nthey street-wise?  Are they equipped and ready to take on  or\r\n\r\ndeal with businessmen from China, Hong Kong, Korea or Japan?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Society as a whole should also be more tolerant of those\r\n\r\nwho  dared  to try but failed.  There should be no stigma  in\r\n\r\nfailure.   Remember, failure is the mother of success.   This\r\n\r\nclimate  of  support will then encourage more to strike  out,\r\n\r\ntake risk and be entrepreneurial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, education should also include the training and\r\n\r\nretraining  of  our  working adults.  It saddens  me  to  see\r\n\r\nworkers in their 40s in my meet-the-people sessions, who  are\r\n\r\nretrenched in the economic restructuring, who could not  find\r\n\r\nnew  jobs  easily,  as they have no new or  relevant  skills.\r\n\r\nSome  are  still  looking for canteen stalls, security  jobs,\r\n\r\ncleaning  jobs, and such like, when the economy  has  changed\r\n\r\nradically.  Many are fast becoming unemployable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should therefore do more for this group of workers,\r\n\r\nand retrain them for the new economy.  We have apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining scheme for the young, why not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  apprenticeship training scheme for the  older  workers.\r\n\r\nIf  necessary, pay them a subsistence allowance when they are\r\n\r\nunder  intensive training, as they have families to  support.\r\n\r\nWe  should  therefore allocate more grants  from  our  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus for adult retraining, and make it a people's movement\r\n\r\nfor skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while we go global, many of our graduates have to\r\n\r\ngo  overseas to work, we must remain rooted in Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nmust  anchor every Singaporean to our own homeland.  But  how\r\n\r\ndo we cultivate this sense of belonging and bonding, when our\r\n\r\nschools  do  not  give much emphasis to our own  history  and\r\n\r\nculture?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History lessons are downplayed or not given much\r\n\r\nattention  in  schools.  Whereas in the United States,  every\r\n\r\nchild  in  school  knows  about  George  Washington,  Abraham\r\n\r\nLincoln,  John  Kennedy, or the American War of Independence.\r\n\r\nWe  must  therefore  give more thought and  priority  to  the\r\n\r\nteaching of history in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion standing in the\r\n\r\nname of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in  his first Budget Statement for the millennium,  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister said that we could expect to get back  soon\r\n\r\nto  the  pre-crisis  growth rate.   We  can  expect  measures\r\n\r\ndesigned to help businesses tide over the crisis will not  be\r\n\r\nextended and  Government charges will be increased very soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate of 55% is now reduced to 25%.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry  of  National Development  has  also  announced\r\n\r\nincreases  in  the development charges.  With the  increases,\r\n\r\nwill  we  once again face the pre-crisis situation  of  asset\r\n\r\ninflation?  Will the rent plus other increases cause the cost\r\n\r\nof  business to rise and our competitiveness to be  depleted?\r\n\r\nWe can rejoice that we are out of the economic difficulty and\r\n\r\ncan  expect better prospects in the new millennium.  But what\r\n\r\nkind  of  a  reward do those people who have made  sacrifices\r\n\r\nget?  The Government announced that it would top up their CPF\r\n\r\nby $250.  Is this meagre\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namount of $250 the only reward that they are getting?   Those\r\n\r\nwho  have  not  contributed to CPF also made  sacrifices  but\r\n\r\nthey do not even get a single cent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1998 when we faced the regional\r\n\r\neconomic crisis, the Government announced a $10 billion cost-cutting package.  But the thrust of cost-cutting was  on  the\r\n\r\nworkers,  through the 10% CPF cut and the  5%  pay  cut.   So\r\n\r\nthrough  the  sacrifices of the workers, the  Government  was\r\n\r\nable  to  cut  down  the cost by $7 billion.   In  1999,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment announced a budget deficit of $5.1 billion.   This\r\n\r\nwas  played  up  in the media as if the Government  was  also\r\n\r\naffected very greatly by the crisis in order to justify  that\r\n\r\nrequiring workers to cut their pay and to make sacrifices are\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Budget debate in 1999, I said that the deficit\r\n\r\nwas not a true deficit but  was a result of large increase in\r\n\r\ndevelopment   estimates.   The  Minister  for  Finance   just\r\n\r\nannounced   that  there  is  now a surplus  of  $3.2  billion\r\n\r\ninstead  of  a  deficit.   This was because  the  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure  estimated in the 1999 budget was  not  used  up.\r\n\r\nThe  Government  has the responsibility  to  explain  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  whether  the  1999 budget was one  with  a  political\r\n\r\nmotive to persuade the people to make sacrifices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, many businessmen faced losses, some factories\r\n\r\neven  had  to close down.  Many Singaporeans had  to  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir purse strings and their belts because of a pay cut, CPF\r\n\r\ncut,  and unemployment.  But the Government was not affected.\r\n\r\nThere  was  no  deficit  - it was played  up  at  that  time.\r\n\r\nInstead, there is now a surplus.  No wonder when the  economy\r\n\r\nwas  still recovering, the Government could not wait  even  a\r\n\r\nmoment in taking the opportunity to announce in November 1999\r\n\r\nthe  restoration of the pay cut for civil servants, including\r\n\r\nthe  Ministers' pay.  Otherwise, the surplus  would  be  more\r\n\r\nthan $3.2 billion.  The Government has forgotten that in 1999\r\n\r\nthey wanted workers to have their pay cut to pull through the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis  together.  The workers' pay  has  not  been\r\n\r\nrestored to the previous level.  The 10% CPF cut in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployer's contribution will only be restored by 2%.  But the\r\n\r\nGovernment took the lead in pay increases for themselves, and\r\n\r\nenjoyed the fruits of economic recovery, while the people  in\r\n\r\ngeneral  were still suffering from the impact of  the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe  people  were hoping that better time would come  in  the\r\n\r\nform of bonuses.  But the Government has beaten them to it by\r\n\r\ntaking  the chunk of the fruit of the economic recovery  with\r\n\r\nthe withdrawal of the 10% tax rebate.  So when times are bad,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy is to first require workers to  make\r\n\r\nsacrifices  by  reducing workers' wages but  when  times  are\r\n\r\ngood,  the Government took care of its own pocket.   This  is\r\n\r\nthe true colour of the PAP Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, the Government has even announced that\r\n\r\nthe  water tariffs will be increased and the water borne  fee\r\n\r\nwill  be  increased by 100%.  All the utilities charges  will\r\n\r\nalso be increased as a result.  It will add to the burden  of\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking from the first Budget of the\r\n\r\nnew  millennium after the economic crisis, we  can  see  that\r\n\r\nwhether in good or bad times, the Government's fiscal  policy\r\n\r\nis  always  \"win-win\" for the Government and \"lose-lose\"  for\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, in  presenting the first Budget  for  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium,  the  Minister  for  Finance  laid  out  the  key\r\n\r\nchallenges facing Singaporeans. His message is that if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  respond  well, we will lose our economic competitiveness\r\n\r\nand  social  cohesion.  This is similar to the very  familiar\r\n\r\nexpression in Chinese, ie, you must fight to win.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Hougang said that the\r\n\r\nGovernment wins but the people lose.  What we are doing is to\r\n\r\nmake  everyone win - the Government wins; the people win;  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  wins, and even the Opposition parties win.  Mr Low  said\r\n\r\nthat  the Government had been acting against the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  But we NTUC leaders know very well why we must\r\n\r\ntake a wage cut, and why there had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be  a reduction in CPF.  There is this Chinese expression\r\n\r\nwhich  says:  \"liude qingshan zai, bu chou  mei  chai  shao\",\r\n\r\nmeaning  as long as the green mountains are there,  one  need\r\n\r\nnot  worry  about  firewood.  So the important  thing  is  to\r\n\r\nretain  the  job,  retain our rice bowl - that  is  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant point.  That is why at that point of time,  we  all\r\n\r\nagreed  that, with the factories facing the financial crisis,\r\n\r\nmany  of them had to close down, and the most pragmatic thing\r\n\r\nto  do  was  to  let the factories survive, so that  everyone\r\n\r\nwould  at  least   retain their jobs.  That is  why  we  were\r\n\r\nprepared  to take a wage cut.  We were all fighting  for  the\r\n\r\nsurvival  of the factories.  All the workers had agreed  that\r\n\r\nwe  would  take a wage cut to retain our jobs.  Even  if  the\r\n\r\nfactories could not survive just with the wage cut, then  let\r\n\r\nus  cut  some of our working days.  Let us take home a little\r\n\r\nless, but let the factories survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could all see where the crisis was. We were willing\r\n\r\nto  undergo  re-training.   Over the  past  few  years,  many\r\n\r\nworkers,  about 40,000 of them, had undergone  retraining  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills.  But there was one thing that I need to\r\n\r\npoint  out,  that  is,  in the Budget Statement  the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  mentioned that we needed to have  an  educated  and\r\n\r\nhighly skilled workforce augmented and invigorated by foreign\r\n\r\ntalents,  but  did not specifically assure the older  workers\r\n\r\nand low-skilled workers that they would not be neglected.  In\r\n\r\nthe  next few years, the Government will be setting  up  more\r\n\r\nfunds for the upgrading of skills for the workers.  Just now,\r\n\r\nDr  Ong also said that for the workers, particularly the low-skilled workers, we should have enough funds to help them  in\r\n\r\ntheir training.  Dr Hu only said that we need a team of high-skilled workers supplemented with foreign talent.  We  should\r\n\r\nhelp the older workers to solve their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to point out that the\r\n\r\nlower  skilled workers are not necessarily older workers  and\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers  are not necessarily  the  lower  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.   These  two  groups of  workers  have  become  very\r\n\r\nsensitive  to  any news about their company's  restructuring,\r\n\r\nmerger and acquisition.  They know\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  when  any of these processes happens to their  company,\r\n\r\nthey are sure to \"tio\" (in Hokkien) or \"kena\" (in Malay), ie,\r\n\r\nthey  will  be \"hit\".  And if the lower skilled  workers  are\r\n\r\nalso  older, they are, like what the Hokkiens say,  \"tia  tio\r\n\r\ntio\"  or in Malay \"mesti kena\", that is, very sure that  they\r\n\r\nwould be hit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many low-skilled workers and older workers have not\r\n\r\nbeen  able  to  find new jobs once they are retrenched.   The\r\n\r\nolder  workers are worst hit.  They are prepared  to  go  for\r\n\r\nretraining.   They are prepared to lower their  expectations.\r\n\r\nBut  they  have  great  difficulties  in  finding  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I propose that the Government introduce  some  tax\r\n\r\nincentives  to encourage employers to hire older workers.   I\r\n\r\nwill elaborate on this during the Committee of Supply debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that under the Manpower 21, we can do more for\r\n\r\nworkers' training and skills certification for them to  enjoy\r\n\r\nlifelong  employability.  This might be the  reason  why  the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  did not elaborate on  this  issue  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech.   However,  during our dialogue sessions  with  union\r\n\r\nleaders,  we  learned  that older workers  were  particularly\r\n\r\nconcerned that they were being discriminated against.  I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government can address this issue before  it  becomes  a\r\n\r\nsocial  problem.  The older workers can be out of job  for  a\r\n\r\nshort  period  as  our social safety net  is  adequate.   But\r\n\r\nprolonged unemployment of a particular group is not desirable\r\n\r\nto  our society.  To the family, to the individuals, it  will\r\n\r\nbe a problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Finance Minister should be\r\n\r\ncommended  for including the grandparents when he grants  tax\r\n\r\nrelief  for  topping-up  CPF accounts.   Taxpayers  who  live\r\n\r\ntogether  with their parents will also enjoy a tax relief  of\r\n\r\n$5,000.   Although the increase is only $500, it is a gesture\r\n\r\nof  the Government which the people will appreciate.  It also\r\n\r\nshows  a  policy change in that the Government  now  includes\r\n\r\ngrandparents as members of the family for tax purposes.  This\r\n\r\nis in keeping with our oriental tradition, and this will also\r\n\r\nhelp foster cohesion and avoid conflicts in the family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS), may I also\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government  to  give  further  tax  incentives  to\r\n\r\nencourage  husbands to contribute to the  accounts  of  their\r\n\r\nwives who have given up working to stay at home to look after\r\n\r\nthe family, so that their children would score A1s and A2s in\r\n\r\ntheir  examinations.  They do not have any CPF  and  probably\r\n\r\nvery little savings for their old age.  So it is only logical\r\n\r\nthat husbands should be encouraged to contribute towards  the\r\n\r\nwives'  accounts  in the SRS.  I will also touch on  the  SRS\r\n\r\nscheme  in  further  detail during the  Committee  of  Supply\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Member for Hougang is not\r\n\r\nhappy  with  the  top-up of $250, the workers  by  and  large\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  this  is  like a  bonus,  like  winning   a\r\n\r\nstarter's  prize  in  a 4-D draw.  It is  a  gesture  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to show appreciation for the sacrifice the workers\r\n\r\nhad  made  during  the crisis.  Even the  self-employed  will\r\n\r\nenjoy  the top-up of $250 if they have made contributions  to\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  accounts  in the past year.   In  the  past,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment required  the self-employed to produce evidence of\r\n\r\ncontribution  to the CPF, particularly the Medisave  account,\r\n\r\nbefore  their business licence could be renewed.   There  was\r\n\r\nsome  unhappiness among the self-employed. But  now  I  think\r\n\r\nthey  will  appreciate the Government's intention  by  making\r\n\r\nthem  contribute to CPF.  Now, they can have a share in  this\r\n\r\ntop-up bonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now facing new challenges in a new knowledge-based economy. We need foreign talents to lay a strong\r\n\r\nfoundation for our transition to a knowledge economy.  And we\r\n\r\nknow  that in the next 20 years, we will be facing a  lot  of\r\n\r\nproblems with an ageing population.  So we must take whatever\r\n\r\nmeasures possible.  We must fight hard so that the Government\r\n\r\nwill win and the people will win too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, can I have your\r\n\r\npermission to seek clarification, please?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Seng has said just\r\n\r\nnow  that we have to fight to win.  But,  after the fighting,\r\n\r\nit  is  the Government that wins.  He also mentioned that the\r\n\r\nworkers  have received some rewards.  During the crisis,  the\r\n\r\nworkers made sacrifices.  The Finance Minister has said  that\r\n\r\nour economy has recovered, and we want to achieve high growth\r\n\r\nrates  as before.  Yet, as of now, apart from retaining their\r\n\r\njobs and  continuing to receive lower wages,  they are unable\r\n\r\nto receive their CPF contribution as in the past ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Low, you rose on a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  Can I ask you to get to the point and ask  Mr\r\n\r\nSeng what part of his speech that you do not understand?  You\r\n\r\nare embarking on a totally different speech.  Can you get  to\r\n\r\nthe point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I am asking him to clarify ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nthink  some  of  the  questions have to be  answered  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance himself.  I am only replying to him from\r\n\r\nthe  point  of  view  of the NTUC.  He was  saying  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should allocate a big sum of money  to  help  the\r\n\r\nworkers  in  their  training.  In the  past  few  years,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  spent  as much as $120 million to  implement  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme.  As I  have  mentioned  just\r\n\r\nnow,  about  40,000  workers benefited  from  the  retraining\r\n\r\nscheme.   Funds  were  indeed  granted  for  the  workers  to\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills.  If Mr Low wants more details on  this,\r\n\r\nhe  can come to NTUC.  I can give him a good briefing on  how\r\n\r\nthese workers have benefited from the scheme.  As far as  the\r\n\r\nworkers  are  concerned, so long as they retain  their  jobs,\r\n\r\nthere is still opportunity for them to go up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low asked whether the workers will go back to their\r\n\r\nprevious  standard of living after the economy has recovered.\r\n\r\nYes,  they can, but they must first  upgrade their skills  as\r\n\r\ntheir  previous skills may well be useless and obsolete  now.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to enjoy a better standard of living in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwe have to create new jobs.  Now in Jurong Island, we have  a\r\n\r\nnumber\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof   petrochemical  factories  offering   various   new   job\r\n\r\nopportunities  which require new skills.  We have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\njobs  available  but  the workers do not  have  the  matching\r\n\r\nskills   to  take  on  these  jobs.   So  they  must  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves,  upgrade their skills so that they  can  take  on\r\n\r\nthese  new and better-paid jobs.  There is a causeway leading\r\n\r\nto  Jurong  Island.  If Mr Low has not been there, he  should\r\n\r\nmake  a  visit.  If he does not know the way, I can take  him\r\n\r\nthere.   Perhaps, he did not read the newspapers.  Now  there\r\n\r\nis an access road leading to Jurong Island.  You can drive or\r\n\r\nwalk  there.  You do not need a permit to go there.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nhe  is  not familiar with that.  It is a public place and  is\r\n\r\nopen  to  everybody.  I can make an appointment with  him  to\r\n\r\nbring  him  there  so  that he can see for  himself  how  the\r\n\r\nworkers  have  enjoyed  a better standard  of  living.   Many\r\n\r\nworkers have also not seized the opportunity to enjoy  better\r\n\r\npay for the jobs available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind both Members that they should\r\n\r\nnot  be embarking on long speeches under the guise of seeking\r\n\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  this opportunity to join in the debate.  I beg  the\r\n\r\nindulgence  of  the House to hear my views on several  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  have  already  been discussed  by  previous  speakers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the advantage in speaking on the second day is  that\r\n\r\nthere is no need to explain the background to these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to the Budget Statement with much\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  and  pride.  The economy did much  better  than\r\n\r\nexpected.   The  actual growth was 5.4% to the best  expected\r\n\r\nforecast  of  1%.  Instead of an expected budget  deficit  of\r\n\r\n$5.1  billion, the fiscal year ended with a surplus  of  $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion.   The  performance is even  more  impressive  if  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  the  economy last  year  actually  performed\r\n\r\nbetter by $8.3 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the additional contribution of $100 million to\r\n\r\nthe Medifund.  I welcome the setting up of the ElderCare Fund\r\n\r\nand the allocation of $200 million to it.  As our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npopulation  ages,  medical expenses  become  more  important.\r\n\r\nThese  two funds will help our poor and old.  This is forward\r\n\r\nthinking towards the future.  We also appreciate the $250 top-up  in  our CPF accounts.  These gestures reinforce the image\r\n\r\nof  a  government that appreciates and cares for its  people.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  Government called for sacrifices from the  people\r\n\r\nduring  difficult times, it also willingly shares the  bounty\r\n\r\nharvest   during   good  times.   However,  pensioners   have\r\n\r\nexpressed  the  hope that they will be especially  remembered\r\n\r\nfor their contributions and sacrifices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excellent economic performance is the result of the\r\n\r\ngood  management  by the Government and the  support  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  However, much credit must go to the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nfor his handling of the national purse string.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister sees a stronger economy this year,\r\n\r\nbut  not  without caveats.  The US economy must not  suddenly\r\n\r\nand  violently convulse, and the Japanese, European and Asian\r\n\r\neconomies   must  continue  on  their  paths   of   recovery.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has yet to fully recover its competitive position.\r\n\r\nIn  view  of  these  uncertainties,  the  business  community\r\n\r\nwonders  why  the  Government was so quick  to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\nsupport  that  it  deemed necessary just a  few  months  ago.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I am certain that our businessmen would  prefer  to\r\n\r\nmake  their  money from better business in a growing  economy\r\n\r\nthan  to merely survive on Government handouts in a slow one.\r\n\r\nWe  therefore hope to hear the Finance Minister announce this\r\n\r\ngood news when he presents his next report card to Parliament\r\n\r\nat the same time next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of the Supplementary Retirement\r\n\r\nScheme  (SRS) to complement the existing CPF scheme  is  most\r\n\r\ntimely.   I  note  that tax is payable only at  the  time  of\r\n\r\nwithdrawal.  It will encourage those who can afford to  save.\r\n\r\nRetirement, however, is a time when a person's means  to  pay\r\n\r\ntaxes  is reduced.  I hope that the Government will work  out\r\n\r\nguidelines   that  if  the  withdrawals  take   place   after\r\n\r\nretirement, the taxes payable\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  be low.  If this is done, it will encourage even  more\r\n\r\npeople to save for their old age.  With one out of every four\r\n\r\nresidents  to be over 65 years of age by 2030, the  SRS  will\r\n\r\nreduce the burden of the Government in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, by exempting the interest income of CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  beyond  the  Minimum Sum, this will  encourage  more\r\n\r\nretirees to keep their money with banks than to expose  their\r\n\r\nfunds  to  risky  ventures.   I think  these  are  farsighted\r\n\r\nchanges   to   the  CPF  scheme.   The  extensions   do   not\r\n\r\ndisadvantage anyone, but give everyone more choices where  to\r\n\r\nkeep their money for their old age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $500 increase in the tax relief per parent for\r\n\r\nchildren who have their aged parents live with them  is  more\r\n\r\nsignificant  for  the message that the Government  recognises\r\n\r\ntheir  filialness  than the actual financial  impact  on  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer's pocket.  The extension of tax relief for CPF  top-up to grandparents is also to be welcomed as this extends the\r\n\r\nrecognition of the Government to filial grandchildren.  I  am\r\n\r\nvery certain that, in the long term, the net benefits of such\r\n\r\nschemes  will far outweigh the financial loss of  revenue  to\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Government that globalisation and\r\n\r\nincreasing competition are realities that we must face.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore   economy  will  technically  and   technologically\r\n\r\nstructure  up.  This will create new jobs which will  require\r\n\r\nnew   and   more  skills  and  knowledge.   If  our  workers,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  older  and lower skilled,  some  843,000  in\r\n\r\nnumber  or 42% of our workforce, do not upgrade their  skills\r\n\r\nand knowledge, they will become structurally unemployable and\r\n\r\nhence unemployed.  These older workers must thus be helped to\r\n\r\nacquire  additional skills.  Dr Hu did not  specify  any  new\r\n\r\ninitiatives though he said that the Government will press  on\r\n\r\nwith  the various existing initiatives.  Does this mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  situation now is satisfactory and under control?   Would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister perhaps share with the House the status of  the\r\n\r\nskills upgrading efforts to-date?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my above concern with our economy is aggravated by\r\n\r\ninformation technology which is driving Singapore  towards  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy, also called the New Economy.  In the\r\n\r\nNew  Economy, knowledge and entrepreneurialship will  be  key\r\n\r\ningredients  for survival and growth.  Jobs  will  change  to\r\n\r\nbecome  information  and knowledge intensive.   Literacy  and\r\n\r\nfamiliarity with information technology are core skills  that\r\n\r\nall   Singaporeans  will  need.   In  the  globalised  arena,\r\n\r\nsalaries and wages will be set globally.  IT workers will  be\r\n\r\npaid  wages set in the developed countries and the  wages  of\r\n\r\nthose  doing non-IT work will be set by workers in  the  poor\r\n\r\nthird  world.  Thus, those who cannot master IT  will  become\r\n\r\nthe  poor of society.  This will be the dividing line between\r\n\r\nthe  rich  and  the poor of society in the future.   This  is\r\n\r\noften referred to as the digital divide.  Is this threat  for\r\n\r\nreal?   The  Americans think so and for  good  reasons.   Our\r\n\r\nGovernment has expressed similar concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the answer? The answer is obvious. Make\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  an  IT-intensive  environment.   A  national\r\n\r\ninformation  highway is already in place for the  people  and\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The PC is now ubiquitous in the workplace, in  our\r\n\r\noffices and shops.  Next, make our people IT-literate.  A few\r\n\r\ndays  ago,  IDA announced several new bold initiatives  under\r\n\r\nthe  Infocomm 21 Masterplan to make three in four workers  to\r\n\r\nbe  IT-literate by the year 2010 and to ensure that  we  have\r\n\r\nenough  infocomm  manpower.  I am assured and  encouraged  by\r\n\r\nthese  efforts.  The Government is quick to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  our  young are met.  Billions of dollars  will  be\r\n\r\nallocated  for  education  of  our  young,  as  much  as  the\r\n\r\nEducation  Ministry  needs.  Hence, yesterday  I  heard  with\r\n\r\ndisbelief,  when  the hon. Opposition Member,  Mr  Chiam  See\r\n\r\nTong, accused the Government of being stingy in providing for\r\n\r\neducation  and  proposed that the Ministry  of  Education  be\r\n\r\nallocated  more  money. He is being disingenuous.   He  knows\r\n\r\nwhat  will  happen if more money is provided than is  needed.\r\n\r\nIn the next election, he and the Opposition will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccuse  the  PAP Government of being wasteful,  misusing  and\r\n\r\nsquandering the hard earned money of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe, for us, the digital divide, if it\r\n\r\ntakes  place, will come not from our young but from our adult\r\n\r\npopulation.  Young Singaporeans readily accept the  high-tech\r\n\r\nlife  and this ready acceptance will only quicken the divide.\r\n\r\nWe have to act decisively and quickly to help our older adult\r\n\r\npopulation to master IT.  In a recent survey, more than  four\r\n\r\nin  every 10 people felt that they lagged behind in  a  high-tech world.  I was thus pleased to hear Communications and IT\r\n\r\nMinister  announced that $25 million is available to  promote\r\n\r\nIT  among  the public.  I believe this amount is too  modest,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  a  good  start.  Given  the  importance  of  the\r\n\r\nobjective,  I am sure more money will be made available  when\r\n\r\nand  as  long  as it is needed.  I strongly urge the  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  to  support  this urgent and  worthwhile  cause  to\r\n\r\nminimise the threat of a digitally divided society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, we must also pro-act. We do not have the\r\n\r\nluxury  to  react.  By the time the problem is  realised,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  too late.  I would urge IDA to work with  PA.   PA\r\n\r\nreaches   out   to  the  community  through  its   grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and  centres.  One initiative  is  to  develop\r\n\r\ncommunity-based IT resource centres to allow  the  people  to\r\n\r\nhave  an  easy  access  to learn and use  IT.   If  a  person\r\n\r\nunderstands the PC and its power, and is confident  of  using\r\n\r\nit,  the family may acquire one for the home.  Access to  the\r\n\r\nInternet  and  its  services should also  be  affordable  and\r\n\r\nreadily  available.  Many new services  like  e-commerce,  e-learning  and  e-banking would also become available  in  the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Technology will make IT increasingly more affordable\r\n\r\nand accessible, but the problem is how to get people to learn\r\n\r\nto use IT, to be comfortable with IT and to be confident with\r\n\r\nusing IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not be stingy in our efforts to create an IT\r\n\r\nsavvy  society. This is a necessary investment for the future\r\n\r\nthat  will  pay handsome dividend.  The development  of  this\r\n\r\nsociety  would be on-going and continuous. Improvements  must\r\n\r\nbe  made  in big and small steps. Many steps would be needed.\r\n\r\nWe must do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude this discussion on a perplexing note.\r\n\r\nWe know that in order to meet the economic imperatives of the\r\n\r\nKBE future, many values held by society would need to change.\r\n\r\nBut these values also underpin our society.  Do we understand\r\n\r\nhow  the  changes  would affect our society?   Have  we  paid\r\n\r\nenough attention to this matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I end my speech. I congratulate\r\n\r\nMinister  Hu  for a well thought-out Budget  and  express  my\r\n\r\nsupport for the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, reading the Budget, a\r\n\r\nremark  made by Mr Ngiam Tong Dow came to mind.  This was  an\r\n\r\nobservation made by Mr Ngiam in an interview that he gave  to\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Journal of the National University of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  when  I  read it, it struck me because that was  what  I\r\n\r\nthought we have been trying to say.  And his observation  was\r\n\r\nthat, behind every economic decision lies a political goal or\r\n\r\nmotive  and, of course, we do not need Mr Ngiam  to  tell  us\r\n\r\nthat.  Economic decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Economic\r\n\r\ndecisions are made with a purpose and with a goal in mind and\r\n\r\nif it is the society that we are concerned with, it must have\r\n\r\nto  be  a  political purpose. So I ask myself,  reading  this\r\n\r\nBudget, what are the political imperatives of this Government\r\n\r\nbehind this Budget that it now presents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to give you what I see to be the political\r\n\r\nimperatives.   But before I do that, may I say a  little  bit\r\n\r\nfurther  about  the Budget, and that is the  question:   what\r\n\r\ndoes  this  Budget  tell  us of our society?   Because  every\r\n\r\nBudget  must  tell  something of the society  for  which  the\r\n\r\nBudget  is being prepared and presented.  What does  it  tell\r\n\r\nus?  Does it tell us of a caring society, or does it tell  us\r\n\r\nof a society that is money-minded and is bent on pursuing the\r\n\r\naccumulation of money and reserves and catering only to those\r\n\r\nwho  are  able to contribute towards this chase, and  leaving\r\n\r\nout  those  who, for no reason of their own,  are  unable  to\r\n\r\ncontribute?  Those are questions that we should ask about any\r\n\r\nBudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, also a Budget has to address itself to everyone.\r\n\r\nWe heard this afternoon\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom Mr Zainul Abidin about cohesion.  He was talking largely\r\n\r\nabout  the cohesion between the different races.  But are  we\r\n\r\nnot  blinding ourselves to something more important and  just\r\n\r\nlooking  at  the relations between the communities?  We  keep\r\n\r\ntalking  about  the bonding of our people, not just  cohesion\r\n\r\nbetween the Indians, Chinese and the Malays, but the cohesion\r\n\r\nbetween  all  our  people, regardless  of  whether  they  are\r\n\r\nChinese,  Indians  or Malays.  There must  be  a  bonding  of\r\n\r\neveryone, the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots,\r\n\r\nthose  who are not handicapped and those who are handicapped.\r\n\r\nThat  is what we should aim at.  And if we can aim and get  a\r\n\r\nsociety  like  that, where there is a real bond  between  our\r\n\r\npeople,  then  we  need not worry about harmonious  relations\r\n\r\nbetween the different communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was coming to Parliament, the taxi-driver who\r\n\r\nbrought  me here said, \"Oh, you are going to the Budget.\"   I\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Yes. Have you read the Budget?\"  He said, \"No, I  have\r\n\r\nnot read it.\"  I said, \"But you should, you know.  You should\r\n\r\nsee  what  is being provided and then speak.\"  He said,  \"How\r\n\r\ncan  I say?  What can I say in this place?\"  He said, \"I have\r\n\r\ngot enough work on my hands, trying to earn my living, trying\r\n\r\nto  get  $40 to $50 a day so that I can survive.  What  am  I\r\n\r\nsupposed  to say about the Budget?\"  So clearly, it does  not\r\n\r\naddress him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said about the political imperatives. Reading the\r\n\r\nBudget, it appears to me that the political imperatives, as I\r\n\r\nhave  said earlier, would be the accumulation of our reserves\r\n\r\nso  that we can always end up with a budget surplus.  And  by\r\n\r\nthat,  impress  the world with our figures  of  growth.   Our\r\n\r\nstatistical  figures  will look impressive  and  significant.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  with this goal, we turned a budget deficit  of  $5.1\r\n\r\nbillion  into  a  surplus  of $3.2  billion.   That  is  some\r\n\r\nachievement.   And  I  see part of it came  from  a  stronger\r\n\r\ncollection  of  the COEs.  That was a strong  boost  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance takes pride in this, and he  says  that\r\n\r\n\"we  are thus back in the happy position of being able to add\r\n\r\nto our reserves.  And we need to accumulate budget surplus in\r\n\r\ngoods years.\"  But I did\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  think  1999 was a good year.  I thought 1999 was  a  bad\r\n\r\nyear but we somehow were able to accumulate a surplus of $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion even in a bad year, so I expect this year it might be\r\n\r\na  budget  surplus of $10 billion and then we shall  be  very\r\n\r\nproud of ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong about having a budget surplus and\r\n\r\ngetting Singapore rich.  But I am reminded of the study  that\r\n\r\nwas made between Singapore and Hong Kong some years ago by  a\r\n\r\nlecturer  or  professor  at  the Massachusetts  Institute  of\r\n\r\nTechnology.   His  conclusion  was  that  Singapore  has  got\r\n\r\nricher,  by the Singapore Government digging deeper into  the\r\n\r\npeople's pockets.  Whereas in Hong Kong, he said, it was  the\r\n\r\ntrue  entrepreneurial skill of the people which has made Hong\r\n\r\nKong richer.  That is something that we have to ponder about.\r\n\r\nAre  we getting richer and richer because we dig deeper  into\r\n\r\nthe people's pockets?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister cites the factors leading to our recovery.\r\n\r\nHe  cites  two  external factors as I see them  -  upturn  in\r\n\r\nglobal   electronics  and  the  turnaround  in  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomies.  These are both external factors that have  helped\r\n\r\nus  to  recover.   But  he said that there  was  an  internal\r\n\r\nsignificant contribution made in Singapore and that  was  the\r\n\r\nacceptance  by our workers of the reduction in the employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution to their CPF and wage cuts.  So, our economy, it\r\n\r\nwould appear, has turned round largely because of our workers\r\n\r\npaying   the  price  by  accepting  cuts  in  the  employer's\r\n\r\ncontribution, foregoing that and further accepting wage  cuts\r\n\r\nand,  what  is more, accepting being thrown out of employment\r\n\r\nfor  months,  unable to find any employment.  It  is  to  our\r\n\r\nworkers, it would appear, besides external factors,  that  we\r\n\r\nowe in a great measure the recovery in our economy. There  is\r\n\r\nnot a word about the contribution from the Ministers. I tried\r\n\r\nto  suggest  that  we could have at least made  some  show-of\r\n\r\ncontributions and that was turned down as it would not help.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now gloating over our recovery because the\r\n\r\nworkers have been able to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmake  that  happen.   The question that  we  should  ask  is:\r\n\r\nshould  not  some of the surplus have been used to  alleviate\r\n\r\nthe  suffering  of  the  workers?  I  proposed  this  when  I\r\n\r\nsuggested the voluntary reduction of the Ministers' salaries.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not good enough saying in fine words about Government\r\n\r\nappreciating workers, accepting CPF and wage cuts.   What  is\r\n\r\nneeded  is  a  little more than words. We need  to  show  the\r\n\r\nappreciation  in terms that would really get to the  workers.\r\n\r\nOne  Member  spoke about the possible use  of  some  of  this\r\n\r\nsurplus  to  further improve the economy by  reducing  costs.\r\n\r\nThat  is  a good question.  Why are we so anxious to  show  a\r\n\r\nsurplus, that we perhaps neglect the people who need help and\r\n\r\ndo  a  bit  more  towards boosting the  economy,  instead  of\r\n\r\nleaving it just to our workers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on, Mr Speaker, Sir, to the allocation\r\n\r\nof  our  monies for this year.  Because here again, it  shows\r\n\r\nthe kind of society we are and our political imperatives.  In\r\n\r\nthe  allocation,  I  see  defence takes  the  largest  share.\r\n\r\nSomebody mentioned about education taking a lion's share, but\r\n\r\ndefence takes $7.4 billion of our monies.  Compared to  that,\r\n\r\nwe are providing for the general education programme  -  I am\r\n\r\nnot  talking  about the entire allocation for  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry   -   but  the  general  education  programme,   ie,\r\n\r\neducating  our  children in Government  schools,  Government-aided  schools  and other independent schools,  we  are  only\r\n\r\nspending $3.13 billion for that.  Defence takes $7.4 billion.\r\n\r\nThe  education of our children takes $3.13 billion, less than\r\n\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I looked at the medical services, what is provided\r\n\r\nfor  the medical care of our people and what do we find?  The\r\n\r\nmedical services are allocated $815.4 million, less than one-seventh of the defence budget.  So, what does it tell  us  of\r\n\r\nour society?  We should ponder as to what is the lesson there\r\n\r\nfor  someone  looking and reading the  Budget.   Is  it  more\r\n\r\nimportant that we should raise the level of education of  our\r\n\r\npeople?  Is it not more important that we should see that our\r\n\r\npeople are in good health, that our people who contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe  economy  are  able to provide enough  medical  care  for\r\n\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are political goods, not economic goods, education\r\n\r\nand healthcare.  Our reserves are not the monies that we have\r\n\r\nstashed  away.  Our reserves are our people.  It  is  on  our\r\n\r\npeople that we depend for the future of Singapore, not on the\r\n\r\nmonies.  So that is where we should be spending the money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see someone criticised Mr Chiam See Tong. I was not\r\n\r\nhere,  but  I  completely echo what he said.   We  should  be\r\n\r\nspending far more on education than we are.  I will  come  to\r\n\r\nthe  expenditure on defence.  I have raised this  every  year\r\n\r\nand  I  shall be missed if I do not touch on that this  year.\r\n\r\nBut let me say a little bit about how important it is that we\r\n\r\nspend  more money on education and health, not on a  showcase\r\n\r\nbut on our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education and health are the key to the economic\r\n\r\nprogress of a country.  We do not need an economist  to  tell\r\n\r\nus  that.   We  seem to pay lip service to it.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nsays  that  less  than  half of Singaporeans  above  40  have\r\n\r\nsecondary  education,  and he says steps  will  be  taken  to\r\n\r\nretrain  these  workers.  But should we wait until  they  are\r\n\r\nover  40  and  unemployed  before we  begin  the  process  of\r\n\r\neducating them?  Should we not catch them young when they are\r\n\r\nin  the  schools?  Should our aim not be to  see  that  every\r\n\r\nchild  in  Singapore  has a minimum of  secondary  education?\r\n\r\nThat is where we should be concentrating our efforts and  our\r\n\r\nmoney.  If we do that and we see that schools turn out  every\r\n\r\nyear enough people with secondary education, then we need not\r\n\r\nhave  to worry about our workforce.  But, obviously,  we  are\r\n\r\nnot  doing  that at the moment.  We do not want  any  elitist\r\n\r\neducation.   There is no harm in providing elitist  education\r\n\r\nfor  some.  But we want education for all.  No one should  be\r\n\r\nleft out of this.  Let us make that our goal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then health. A healthy worker is an economically\r\n\r\nproductive  person.   If he is unhealthy,  he  ceases  to  be\r\n\r\neconomically productive.  So, should we not be spending  more\r\n\r\non  healthcare?  I hope when we come to discuss the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof Health's estimates, I shall have the time to say something\r\n\r\nabout the cost of medical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncare in Singapore. But because time is moving on, I will move\r\n\r\nto the expenditure on defence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Mr Speaker, Sir, we are allocating the\r\n\r\nbiggest  share of $7.4 billion of our monies to defence.   We\r\n\r\nhave  a  faithful  press in Singapore.   I  see  BG  Yeo  has\r\n\r\nsuddenly said, \"No let up in our control of the local press.\"\r\n\r\nI  am sure the press will say, \"Oh, Jeyaretnam doesn't want a\r\n\r\nstrong Singapore.\"  \"Jeyaretnam wants a weak Singapore.\"   At\r\n\r\none  time, it was said  that I would rather have the Russians\r\n\r\ncome  in.  That was when I was here in Parliament in 1981  to\r\n\r\n1986.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singaporeans were\r\n\r\ntold  in  plain language why we have to spend  such  a  large\r\n\r\nchunk  of  our monies on defence.  Why do we have  to  put  a\r\n\r\nceiling  of 6% of GDP on our defence expenditure, so that  we\r\n\r\ncan  go on increasing until we reach that?  Is that the goal,\r\n\r\nthat we should spend 6% of our GDP on defence?  I see that it\r\n\r\nhas gone up every year.  From 1995, when it was $5 billion in\r\n\r\nthe  chart given, it is now $7.4 billion in 2000.   So,  what\r\n\r\nare we going up to next year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In previous years, I quoted the spending in other\r\n\r\ncountries.  I have not got the time to do that this year.   I\r\n\r\npointed  out that Singapore was very high in the spending  on\r\n\r\ndefence.  The only country that exceeded our defence spending\r\n\r\nwere those countries which were in trouble spots.  I see that\r\n\r\nIndia has suddenly increased its defence spending.  I do  not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  expressed in terms of GDP  percentage  it  has\r\n\r\nexceeded  Singapore's.  But India is in a  totally  different\r\n\r\nposition.   They have some trouble on their borders.   Do  we\r\n\r\nhave trouble?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is time, Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwere  told  where  do  we expect the threat.   Where  is  the\r\n\r\ntrouble coming for Singapore and why is it necessary  for  us\r\n\r\nto  spend  the money that we are proposing to spend  to  meet\r\n\r\nthis  trouble?   We do not want just remarks like,  \"Oh,  the\r\n\r\nsecurity  of  Singapore is important or paramount.\"   No  one\r\n\r\nquestions it.  The Workers' Party does not question it.   The\r\n\r\nWorkers' Party is second\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  none in asserting that the security of Singapore is  very\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggested, even in the 80s when I was here, that we\r\n\r\nset  up  a committee to study the effective cost of defending\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Why  do we not do that, so that the  public  can\r\n\r\nsee?   I  suggested that perhaps we should consider  reducing\r\n\r\nthe  period of national service.  I see that carries quite  a\r\n\r\nbit  of chunk of the operating cost.  Do we need to keep  our\r\n\r\nboys  for  2-21/2 years in the army to give them the training\r\n\r\nthat  they need?  Could we not speed it up and cut the  cost?\r\n\r\nOr  are  we just happy to go on and show that we are spending\r\n\r\nall this money on our defence?  The trouble is that it may be\r\n\r\nsending  the  wrong  signals to our neighbours  to  see  that\r\n\r\nSingapore keeps increasing its defence expenditure.  So I ask\r\n\r\nthat  we explain to the people.  If we explain to them,  they\r\n\r\nwill  accept  it.  But I am asked by several people,  believe\r\n\r\nme,  why is it necessary for us to spend this amount of money\r\n\r\nin  our defence when, as I have said before, the world  would\r\n\r\nappear to be getting a safer place, particularly this region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say a little about the provision for the ageing\r\n\r\npopulation.  I see that the Government plans to provide  what\r\n\r\nit  calls  a Supplementary Retirement Scheme.  That,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister  explains, is to be purely voluntary.   If  you  are\r\n\r\nable  to put aside, yes, come and put it aside.  What if  you\r\n\r\nare not able to put it aside?  If you need all the money that\r\n\r\nyou  are earning to keep your body and soul together and  you\r\n\r\nare  unable to save, so you are not going to be looked  after\r\n\r\nwhen you are 65 and over.  Instead of all these schemes, when\r\n\r\nwill this Government move on to study a proper pension scheme\r\n\r\nfor all our citizens above the age of 65 so that the cost  of\r\n\r\nthis  pension  is met across the board, everyone contributing\r\n\r\ntowards  this national social security?  What is  wrong  with\r\n\r\nthat?  What is wrong with a national health service?  Why  do\r\n\r\nwe  not  set  up a committee to study this?  Or  are  we  not\r\n\r\ninterested?  What are our political imperatives?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a plea for greater\r\n\r\ntransparency in information provided in the management of our\r\n\r\nfinances.   Not too long ago I tabled a Question for  Written\r\n\r\nAnswer of the Minister for Finance asking whether we could be\r\n\r\ntold  about all the losses that have been suffered by wholly-owned  Government linked companies from 1965.  I got a reply,\r\n\r\na long one, but in essence, it does not make sense.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, the time allotted\r\n\r\nfor your speech has expired.\r\n\r\n<br>2.02 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to  support  the motion standing in  the  name  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This recession that we have just emerged from reminds me\r\n\r\nin  many ways of the recession we had between 1986 and  1987.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  it  was short and we seemed to have recovered  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  full impact was felt.  Secondly, the  Government\r\n\r\nwas quick to take measures to cut costs, improve productivity\r\n\r\nand  help  businesses look for new markets further  from  the\r\n\r\nregion  affected by the downturn.  Thirdly, the cost  cutting\r\n\r\nmeasures,  especially the reduction in CPF  contributions  by\r\n\r\nthe  employers,  were  fully supported by  the  trade  unions\r\n\r\nagain.  The speed with which we have recovered ahead  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries reflects several  inherent  strengths\r\n\r\nthat have often been taken for granted.  These are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, an honest, stable, decisive and competent\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an enlightened trade union body with bold\r\n\r\nleaders and supportive members and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a sound banking and financial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, many years of conservative budgeting resulting\r\n\r\nin healthy cumulative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinancial  reserves that are able to tide us over periods  of\r\n\r\nrecessions; and,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, business people with the drive and tenacity to\r\n\r\ninnovate and think of new ways of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is remarkable that even in a recession year in 1999,\r\n\r\nwe  were  able to accumulate reserves of about $3.2  billion.\r\n\r\nThe Minister has given the reasons for it but I do  not think\r\n\r\nwe  are surprised any more because in the last 12 years since\r\n\r\nI have been in Parliament, the actual surplus has always been\r\n\r\na  few  billion  dollars  more than budgeted,  whether  in  a\r\n\r\nrecession or periods of economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget reflects the unexpected economic\r\n\r\nrecovery last year, with a growth rate of 5.4% and forecasted\r\n\r\ngrowth  of  between 4.5% and 6.5% for this  year.   It  is  a\r\n\r\nbalanced  budget  in that it attempts to retain  certain  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions given away during the recession, reduce  some  in\r\n\r\nsectors  that  have  not fully recovered  and  remove  others\r\n\r\ntotally  in  sectors  that are deemed to  be  growing.   This\r\n\r\nbudget   has  also  addressed  the  need  to  be  competitive\r\n\r\nglobally,  especially  in  the  financial  sector   and   the\r\n\r\npromotion  of technopreneurship in Singapore.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  the  budget also addresses the need to look after  our\r\n\r\nelderly relatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the economy has recovered, achieving a\r\n\r\nrespectable 5.4% last year, the growth is not even across all\r\n\r\nthe industries.  There is concern in sectors that are lagging\r\n\r\nbehind, mainly construction, business services and small  and\r\n\r\nmedium-sized  enterprises.  They fear that the stock  markets\r\n\r\nmay   have  moved  ahead  of  fundamentals  and  misled   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  into  removing  or  restoring  tax  rebates   and\r\n\r\nconcessions  a  little bit too early.  Let  me  say  that  my\r\n\r\nfeedback  on  this  is  based on anecdotal  evidence  through\r\n\r\ninformal  conversations with business people from  SMEs,  and\r\n\r\nnot from any formal surveys or studies conducted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to the specifics of the budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Part II, page 5 of the Budget Statement, it is stated\r\n\r\nthat the Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nExpenditure includes a provision of almost $1 billion for new\r\n\r\npriority  projects that may materialise in the course  of  FY\r\n\r\n2000.   I  would like to ask the Finance Minister whether  we\r\n\r\nalways  make such provisions, which is a large amount.   What\r\n\r\nare  some  of the priority projects that may arise,  or  have\r\n\r\narisen  in the past, that require the use of such provisions?\r\n\r\nAre  these  provisions responsible for  some  of  the  actual\r\n\r\nbudget  surpluses over forecast that we get  at  the  end  of\r\n\r\nevery fiscal year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has said that the construction and business\r\n\r\nservices sectors have not recovered from the recession.   Can\r\n\r\nwe  not  do  more in terms of tax concessions for  these  two\r\n\r\nsectors to help speed up their recovery?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Supplementary Retirement Scheme to\r\n\r\nencourage  Singaporeans to supplement their  CPF  savings  by\r\n\r\ncontributing  voluntarily to private  funds  over  and  above\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF savings.  Since there is already a percentage  cap\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  employee's salary, I would like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to make the contributions totally tax exempt.  As it\r\n\r\nstands,  the SRS only defers the payment of tax to  the  time\r\n\r\nthe  savings  are withdrawn.   The system may be  inequitable\r\n\r\ndepending on the marginal tax rate of the contributor at  the\r\n\r\ntime  of  contribution, and again, at the time of withdrawal.\r\n\r\nThose  who are successful and continue to work way  past  the\r\n\r\nage  of withdrawal of the funds may end up paying more  taxes\r\n\r\nin  the end than if they were to save the money on their own.\r\n\r\nI  hope  the Minister will take this point into consideration\r\n\r\nin formulating the details of the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laud the Government for bringing down the corporate\r\n\r\ntax  rate by 0.5% to 25.5%.  However, I am a bit puzzled  why\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  personal income tax rate for the individual  is\r\n\r\nnot  brought  down  in tandem. There is  now  a  gap  of  2.5\r\n\r\npercentage  points between the top personal income  tax  rate\r\n\r\nand the corporate tax rate.  Will this not encourage the very\r\n\r\nwealthy and financially savvy to exploit the difference?   At\r\n\r\n25.5%, we are also still about 9.5% higher than Hong Kong.  I\r\n\r\nknow  that many high net worth individuals and even companies\r\n\r\npark\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmost of their funds in lower tax regimes like Hong Kong.  Can\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  give us some indication on how much  funds  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are parked overseas and the estimated  tax  loss\r\n\r\nto  us  as a result?  Is there any measure the Minister plans\r\n\r\nto take to encourage Singaporeans to repatriate some of these\r\n\r\nfunds home?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rebate on commercial and industrial\r\n\r\nproperties  of 55% will be extended for one more  year  at  a\r\n\r\nreduced  rebate  of 25% only.  Given the weak  state  of  the\r\n\r\nrental market, I urge the Minister to consider extending  the\r\n\r\nrebate at 55% as before for one more year.  This will be  one\r\n\r\nway  to  help  the construction sector recover more  quickly.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the tax exemption on property tax for land  under\r\n\r\ndevelopment could have been extended for another year  or  so\r\n\r\nto encourage construction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened by the Government's initiative to give\r\n\r\ntax  concessions to inventors and innovators  and  to  extend\r\n\r\nsuch  incentives to cover the non-manufacturing  sector.   To\r\n\r\nencourage  entrepreneurship, the Government  should  consider\r\n\r\ngiving  some  tax  incentives to start-up companies  per  se,\r\n\r\nwhether   they  have  inventions  or  innovations  that   are\r\n\r\nprotectable.  Perhaps, all start-up companies should be given\r\n\r\na  reduced corporate tax rate of three years to help them  to\r\n\r\nreinvest and grow the business faster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government is giving estate duty\r\n\r\nexemption  for  residential properties up to $9  million  and\r\n\r\nonly  $600,000 for all other dutiable assets.  I have  spoken\r\n\r\nup  on  this before and I still find that this law encourages\r\n\r\nover  consumption  in  residential properties  that  are  not\r\n\r\nproductive  assets.  I still maintain that other assets  such\r\n\r\nas  stocks  and  shares should be given the  same  exemption,\r\n\r\nespecially  now that we are encouraging more Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbe  entrepreneurs, so they would be owning shares rather than\r\n\r\nresidential  properties.   I urge the  Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nputting  all  assets together for the purpose of estate  duty\r\n\r\nexemption.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also support the plan to introduce enhanced tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  for stock options. While the study on the  details\r\n\r\nis  still  underway, I would like to ask that tax concessions\r\n\r\nbe  considered for companies providing supporting services to\r\n\r\nsuch  start-up  companies and who are paid in  shares  rather\r\n\r\nthan  in  cash.   This  is  getting  increasingly  common  as\r\n\r\nlawyers,  accountants,  auditors, consultants  and  financial\r\n\r\nadvisers  provide  services for such start-up  companies  and\r\n\r\naccept  shares  in lieu of cash payment.  The shares  are  of\r\n\r\nvalue  only  if  the  start-up succeeds  and  goes  for  IPO,\r\n\r\notherwise  these professionals end up working for free.   The\r\n\r\ntax  treatment  should take the risks of  such  professionals\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerald Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerald Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every\r\n\r\nyear  we  all anxiously await the announcement of the  Budget\r\n\r\nand  most  of us would have a long wish list.  We would  want\r\n\r\nmore   to   be  done  for  businesses,  community,  and   the\r\n\r\nindividuals. Inevitably, based on the average wish list,  one\r\n\r\nwould always be disappointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an individual, I would like to have great reduction\r\n\r\nin tax rates, greater reliefs, more rebates, etc.  After all,\r\n\r\nthe  effective  corporate tax rate has  been  increased  from\r\n\r\n23.4%  last  year  to  26% and then  to  25.5%  only  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  year.  It seems that most of us share the  concern\r\n\r\nthat  many  corporations are feeling the  aftershock  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis,  and  could  do  with  continuing  support.\r\n\r\nPersonal  tax rebates have also been reduced.  I am concerned\r\n\r\nbecause  there  is much less to save for my  post  retirement\r\n\r\nera.   I  am  sure  that all who have celebrated  their  50th\r\n\r\nbirthday will feel this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the forthcoming introduction of the\r\n\r\nSupplementary  Retirement Scheme.  We have to  wait  for  the\r\n\r\ndetails  but for those of us who are treated as self-employed\r\n\r\nand  do not contribute to the CPF scheme, we await with bated\r\n\r\nbreath to see if the scheme could be extended to beyond  just\r\n\r\nemployees.    I  assume  that  contributions  will   be   tax\r\n\r\ndeductible and I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhope that the ceiling on such contributions will be set high.\r\n\r\nIn  the  final analysis, either we are able to take  care  of\r\n\r\nourselves or we become a burden to society.  With a  generous\r\n\r\nscheme, more people would be included to save a greater  part\r\n\r\nof their income.  Not every one is savvy enough to mind their\r\n\r\nown  savings  through  investments or  even  to  discern  and\r\n\r\nidentify  the  better  managed  funds.   For  a  majority  of\r\n\r\ncitizens  there would be a preference in favour of a  secured\r\n\r\nscheme  that  pays a decent return.  There are enough  horror\r\n\r\nstories  of  CPF  savings being whittled  away  through  poor\r\n\r\ninvestment  decisions.  Whatever the rationale for suggesting\r\n\r\nthat  this  scheme is for employees only,  I  hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  will consider including self-employed  persons  for\r\n\r\nthe  scheme.  Growingly, the numbers of self-employed  should\r\n\r\nincrease.  There will be more home-based businesses set up by\r\n\r\nindividuals,  people  with creative ideas  and  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nremain independent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the ElderCare Fund is most timely.\r\n\r\nWhilst being surrounded by loving family members would be the\r\n\r\nideal  environment for rehabilitative care,  the  reality  is\r\n\r\nthat  most  homes are unsuitable for such care.  Everyone  is\r\n\r\nout working or schooling.  At best the patient is left to the\r\n\r\ncare  of  a house-help, an additional live-in that crams  the\r\n\r\nhome   environment  and  often  causes  tension.   With   the\r\n\r\nElderCare  Fund,  there should be available  more  affordable\r\n\r\nnursing  home care where the patient can be properly attended\r\n\r\nto for rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People I have discussed the Budget with initially\r\n\r\nwondered why I am satisfied with the Budget.  For me,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  realisation  that  we are moving from  direct  taxes  to\r\n\r\nindirect  taxes through the GST.  I recall that the Minister,\r\n\r\nwhen he introduced the GST, said that he would retain the GST\r\n\r\nrate  at 3% for five years.  That was in 1994.  Well,  it  is\r\n\r\nstill  at  3%.  I hope that it will be kept at this rate  for\r\n\r\nanother  10  years  at least, or dare I wish  for  it  to  be\r\n\r\npermanently so.  With an indirect tax regime, I feel more  in\r\n\r\ncontrol.  By controlling my expenses I am saving on taxes and\r\n\r\nreally there is no limit to how much I can save if I keep  my\r\n\r\nlife simple.  Incentives and schemes would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  qualifying factors and I might not benefit from any  or\r\n\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of my satisfaction with the Budget, I would\r\n\r\nlike to request for higher basic personal and family reliefs.\r\n\r\nSuch  higher reliefs should not be conditional such as  those\r\n\r\nbenefiting  only  graduate mothers,  or  those  who  opt  for\r\n\r\nseparate assessment, etc.  The basic reliefs such as for  the\r\n\r\nself, wife, children should be increased.  It certainly costs\r\n\r\nmuch  more  than $2,000 per annum to maintain  a  wife  or  a\r\n\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is scope for considering a two-tier corporate tax\r\n\r\nsystem.   Small enterprises, including the start-ups,  should\r\n\r\nbe  taxed  at  a  much  lower  rate.   The  greatest  problem\r\n\r\nencountered by start-ups is cash flow management.  They  need\r\n\r\nto  plough  every single cent back into the  business.   Very\r\n\r\noften the key personnel in a start-up draws very little or no\r\n\r\nsalary.   Those who are lucky enough to generate a profit  in\r\n\r\nthe  first  couple of years will feel the pain of  having  to\r\n\r\nreduce their precious cash flow through the payment of taxes.\r\n\r\nA  scheme  for  start-ups  could be  based  on  turnover  and\r\n\r\nrestricted to the first three years of the business.   During\r\n\r\nthis  three-year period, they could be granted a  tax  rebate\r\n\r\nof,  say,  50%.  I believe that such a scheme would encourage\r\n\r\nmore  people to become entrepreneurs.  We should not set  our\r\n\r\nsights  on  just  the glamour business.   In  any  successful\r\n\r\ncommunity there must be a variety of providers.  We will  not\r\n\r\nhave  a  healthy manufacturing base if there are  no  support\r\n\r\nindustries.  We see such problems cropping up in the emerging\r\n\r\neconomies.  We must retain and encourage the establishment of\r\n\r\nmore  support industries.  This time it will include  the  e-commerce  sector and there will be many creative  individuals\r\n\r\nwho  can  remain independent and provide first-class  support\r\n\r\nservices  such as creative work, including the designing  and\r\n\r\ncoding of web pages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rapidly ageing society, it is imperative that\r\n\r\npeople  are engaged in active ageing.  It does not matter  if\r\n\r\nthey  are  really  financially independent.  Everyone  should\r\n\r\nremain active, continuously setting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  achieving goals - having something important to wake  up\r\n\r\nto,  to  live  for.  Active ageing could be in the  field  of\r\n\r\nvoluntary services but in a small nation like ours  and  with\r\n\r\nthe  belief  that every Singaporean matters, everyone  should\r\n\r\ntry  to  remain in the workforce - employed or self-employed.\r\n\r\nWith  lower  taxes or special tax rebates for  older  people,\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  the incentive to provide  services,  using\r\n\r\ntheir   accumulated   experiences  and  providing   them   at\r\n\r\ncompetitive rates, or even start a small business  that  they\r\n\r\nhave always dreamt about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, more can and should be done for the individuals and\r\n\r\nsmall   enterprises.   We  should  not  focus  only  on   big\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   Big businesses are important for  our  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment.   However, our society will be the  richer  when\r\n\r\nindividuals  are fired-up to explore and try their  hands  at\r\n\r\nnew  things.   We will be creating a home with a  variety  of\r\n\r\ninterests  being fulfilled.  There will be greater scope  for\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean to matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>2.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, even\r\n\r\nas  I  rise in support of the financial policy for the  short\r\n\r\nterm,  as outlined by the Minister for Finance, I am  mindful\r\n\r\nof the multiple challenges that we in Singapore are currently\r\n\r\nfacing for the longer term:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, ensuring that we stay in play on the global\r\n\r\nfront, even after emerging from the Asian crisis;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, crafting the appropriate response to the\r\n\r\nonslaught of technology in traditional businesses, especially\r\n\r\nfor sectors which are important to our survival and for which\r\n\r\nhitherto we have a competitive edge, whilst;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, putting in place measures to address potential\r\n\r\nsocial  issues,  such as an ageing population  or  a  digital\r\n\r\ndivide.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given the confluence of the above challenges,\r\n\r\nmaintaining the status quo will not do.  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the economic crisis, we have implemented\r\n\r\ncost-cutting measures and made the necessary adjustments.  By\r\n\r\nmost  accounts, we have weathered the crisis well.   We  need\r\n\r\nnow  to  balance carefully the intention to restore  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts  with  staying competitive.  Already, manifestations  of\r\n\r\nour  tight labour market, such as rising staff turnover,  are\r\n\r\nemerging  again.   This is beginning to  affect  the  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Shift in Business Focus</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the global economy is transforming so quickly that\r\n\r\nold  logic  and management tools are no longer relevant.   At\r\n\r\nthe  same time, the consumer's position has been strengthened\r\n\r\nsubstantially by the application of technology.  He  now  has\r\n\r\ninfinite choices at increasingly efficient prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market offerings will in tandem reflect more\r\n\r\ncustomisation  for  the  individual consumer.   For  example,\r\n\r\nbuying  a customised motor vehicle, with gadgets and fittings\r\n\r\nreflecting  one's  preferences, will soon be  commonplace  in\r\n\r\nmany  countries.   Really,  the shift  in  focus  is  towards\r\n\r\ncreating digital value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector has the greatest impetus to change as\r\n\r\ntheir  focus  on  profit and loss or P&L is a strong  driver.\r\n\r\nThey  have  already taken all these challenges on board.   We\r\n\r\nare  constantly bombarded with news of yet another merger of,\r\n\r\nsometimes seemingly unrelated, businesses.  There is a school\r\n\r\nof  thought  which seeks to explain the Dow's gravity-defying\r\n\r\nact  - that technology has inspired consolidation and enabled\r\n\r\nbusinesses   to   record   real  productivity   gains,   hype\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, for our economy, gaps may soon be\r\n\r\nevident  and even widened on two fronts, firstly, the  public\r\n\r\nsector and, secondly, the individual contributor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Role of the Public Sector</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation brought about by technology is\r\n\r\neconomy-wide, system-\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwide   and  \"the  excellence  of  every  government  is   its\r\n\r\nadaptation to the state of those to be governed by it\".   The\r\n\r\npublic  sector  is  not immune to these  dramatic  forces  of\r\n\r\nchange.   Just  as  businesses must transform  themselves  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  compete  in the digital  marketplace,  so  must\r\n\r\ngovernments.   Our  public sector, or  parts  of  our  public\r\n\r\nsector,  may  not  be exposed directly to these  same  market\r\n\r\npressures  but  for it to be a more efficient  and  effective\r\n\r\nservice  provider, it must remain relevant  to  the  changing\r\n\r\neconomy that it operates in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am by no means expressing dissatisfaction over\r\n\r\nour  public sector.  On the contrary, I am very proud of  the\r\n\r\nachievements  thus  far.   In  fact,  I  believe  we  have  a\r\n\r\nrelatively nimble and adaptable public sector which has  made\r\n\r\ngiant strides in supporting our economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the evolution of the new economy may dictate a\r\n\r\npace  and  an extent of change within the public  sector  far\r\n\r\ngreater than expected or planned.  Very soon, it would not be\r\n\r\nenough  for  Ministries  to just focus  on  total  costs,  as\r\n\r\noutlined in the Minister's Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a private business is organised specifically to\r\n\r\nmanipulate  resources  so  that  it  can  provide  acceptable\r\n\r\nshareholder returns.  Increasingly, the public sector must be\r\n\r\norganised in a similar fashion, so that it reaps economic and\r\n\r\nsocial  returns for its shareholders, who are the  owners  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest two broad philosophies for the\r\n\r\npublic sector to consider adopting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a)  Privatisation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should accelerate the privatisation\r\n\r\nprocess.  As many public service agencies as possible  should\r\n\r\nbe  corporatised  or even privatised so  as  to  emulate  the\r\n\r\nprivate industry's more efficient way of managing resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where liberalisation or removal of anti-competition\r\n\r\nbarriers will render a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlevel  playing  field for all interested  participants,  this\r\n\r\nshould  be  undertaken purposefully, and as  soon  as  it  is\r\n\r\neconomically viable to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that we have already made substantial headway in\r\n\r\nfinancial services, and recently in telecommunications.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  for Trade and Industry has also announced plans  to\r\n\r\nderegulate  power  generation and supply.   However,  several\r\n\r\nsegments  are  still  outstanding,  for  example,  sea   port\r\n\r\nservices,   airport   services,   land   transportation   and\r\n\r\neventually even broadcasting.  These are all integral to  the\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  necessary to support the digital  marketplace\r\n\r\nand  any  inefficient link will be a weak link in the  entire\r\n\r\nsupply chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(b)  Focus on Performance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many public agencies have mandates which are not\r\n\r\ntangibly  or directly related to the running of the  economy,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  old  or the new, for example, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports.  However, as they  utilise\r\n\r\nresources and play an important social role, there must be  a\r\n\r\nshift in focus away from traditional budgetary mandates, such\r\n\r\nas  cost-containment, to a semblance of P&L accountability or\r\n\r\nconsumer satisfaction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should consider setting benchmarks from\r\n\r\nthe  users' perspectives, which can be a modification of  the\r\n\r\nstated  Desired  Outcomes  and Productivity  Measures.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  public sector employees should be assessed  and\r\n\r\nmotivated at the individual level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is already obvious, technology will continue to\r\n\r\nenable many Government agencies to better serve consumers  of\r\n\r\npublic  services,  including businesses.   Yet,  even  though\r\n\r\ntechnology  is  fast  becoming the most  important  input  or\r\n\r\nresource, it is still widely viewed as a cost and not a means\r\n\r\nto   exploiting   distribution  and  existing  infrastructure\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mindset Changes</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues have alluded to, it is no\r\n\r\nlonger enough to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmaintain  the status quo, even if it were possible.   Neither\r\n\r\nis  it  about creating barriers to entry.  The incumbent  can\r\n\r\nfrequently  use its dominant position to build a  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage but this cannot be achieved by imposing barriers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither is it about cutting costs to maintain a marginal\r\n\r\nprice advantage, as the edge will not be sustainable.  It  is\r\n\r\nreally  about  coming  up  with  new  ideas,  about  thinking\r\n\r\ncreatively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may quote from Douglas Aldrich, it is about\r\n\r\ninnovative  actions  that  take  nothing  for  granted,   not\r\n\r\nexisting  monopoly,  neither regulatory barriers  nor  market\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember how our fresh food needs used to be met only\r\n\r\nduring the early morning hours at the wet market.  With  more\r\n\r\ndual  career families, supermarkets offering fresh food  like\r\n\r\nNTUC  Fairprice and Cold Storage, soon became popular.   Now,\r\n\r\nwith  a  global  marketplace and irregular working  patterns,\r\n\r\nmany  consumers would simply want to be able to  order  their\r\n\r\nfood  needs online and have them delivered at some  appointed\r\n\r\ntime.   So, e-tailing is fast evolving.  And we can see  from\r\n\r\nthis   example  that  the  solution  is  not  about   opening\r\n\r\nsupermarkets round-the-clock but really providing the avenues\r\n\r\nfor customers to have their needs met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all have certain mindsets that have evolved over\r\n\r\ntime  such  as career and job aspirations, desiring  after  a\r\n\r\nknown  pattern  to work and retirement.  But  many  of  these\r\n\r\nmindsets  are  not under scrutiny and they will  need  to  be\r\n\r\nchanged the sooner the better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of my colleagues have suggested how we should\r\n\r\nchange mindsets.  So I will not belabour the point, except to\r\n\r\nsay a 9-to-5 job for all of our working lives till we retire,\r\n\r\nwith  a  stable employer such as the Government or  a  multi-national  company, will no longer do.  Instead,  a  good  bet\r\n\r\nwill  be to contribute towards a 24-by-7 (24 hours by 7 days)\r\n\r\nsolution that evolves with changing needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will require us to constantly think out-of-the-box,\r\n\r\nacquire  knowledge  and  have  an  appetite  for  uncertainty\r\n\r\nwithout  the comfort of safety nets.  An assumption  of  risk\r\n\r\nand  an  open  mind  would  have to be  the  working  mantra.\r\n\r\nContrary to throwing out old models, I believe that the risk-reward  relationship will continue to hold true and that  the\r\n\r\nrewards  can  be  handsome for the innovative,  diligent  and\r\n\r\nadventurous contributor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Budget as presented by\r\n\r\nthe Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget has generally been welcomed on the\r\n\r\nground.    In  particular,  its  focus  on  the  family,   on\r\n\r\nretirement planning and also the high-tech sectors  has  been\r\n\r\ncommended.  The man-in-the-street of course feels that  there\r\n\r\nare  slim  pickings, but of course the optimists  will  argue\r\n\r\nthat slim pickings are better than no pickings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to comment on the Budget from the\r\n\r\nperspective  of three tenets of fiscal policy.   First,  data\r\n\r\nreliability;  second, distortionary effects of  some  of  the\r\n\r\npolicies; and, third, allocative efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion seeks this House's support for the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  financial  policy.   Public  policy   must   be\r\n\r\npredicated  on reliable data, and that is especially  so  for\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy.   Robust forecasts of  GDP  growth  rates,\r\n\r\nrevenue   and   expenditure  engender   confidence   in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   financial  programme.    It   also   reassures\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  that the choices implicit in  the  Government's\r\n\r\ntaxation and spending programme are indeed necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this light, the $8 billion turnaround Budget has\r\n\r\nraised  many eyebrows.  Many have already commented  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse on the sheer magnitude of this change.  Allow me,  Sir,\r\n\r\nto  focus instead on the contributory factors and the  nature\r\n\r\nof  this change which, I believe, paints a revealing picture.\r\n\r\nThe key question is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether this could have been anticipated, if not to the  full\r\n\r\nextent,  then  at least partially.  Firstly, expenditure  was\r\n\r\nlower  by  10%, or $3.4 billion, compared to the forecast  of\r\n\r\n$29.4  billion, and it was attributed to two factors -  lower\r\n\r\ncost and the rescheduling of some development expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the relevant agencies who forecast this\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure, in the first place, have anticipated\r\n\r\nthis  delay?   More importantly, should there  be  safeguards\r\n\r\nagainst   such  needless  reservation  of  scarce  resources,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in  a  year when there  were  other  compelling\r\n\r\nneeds?   Otherwise, departments will continue to  over-budget\r\n\r\nwith impunity, secure in the knowledge that any residual that\r\n\r\nis unutilised can be rolled over to the next financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, Sir, there has been a 20% increase,\r\n\r\nor  $4.8 billion from the forecast of $24.1 billion.  The  V-shaped  recovery has been assigned responsibility.   Sir,  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  1999,  the  Government's forecast  for  growth  was\r\n\r\nbetween -1% and 1%.  The final figure was 5.4% and there were\r\n\r\nregular  updates  along the year.  The  question  I  have  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  sufficient instruments in our  forecasting\r\n\r\nmethods  to  anticipate some of these changes.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has mentioned in his speech the  composite  of\r\n\r\nleading indicators which is supposed to lead economic  growth\r\n\r\nby  up to nine months.  That would mean that, in February, we\r\n\r\nshould  have  a  reasonable indication of what  the  economic\r\n\r\nscenario  should be towards the end of the year.   Similarly,\r\n\r\nwe  also use other proxies like the non-oil retained imports.\r\n\r\nOne   reason   often  given  for  variability  in   forecast,\r\n\r\nespecially  in Singapore's context, is that we  are  an  open\r\n\r\neconomy  and that there are several exogenous factors  beyond\r\n\r\nour  control.  So the question then is whether we can in fact\r\n\r\nseparate   out   what   the   impact   of   those   exogenous\r\n\r\nuncontrollable factors are as opposed to what is  within  our\r\n\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are not mere academic questions. The\r\n\r\nGovernment's budget and the premises on which it is built are\r\n\r\nof great\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical and economic consequence.  The business sector sees\r\n\r\nit  as a bellwether of economic health and for the country as\r\n\r\na whole, it is an important tool for shaping expectations and\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   Sir,  the  greater the  divergence  between  our\r\n\r\nforecast and the actuals, the weaker this instrument will  be\r\n\r\nas  a tool of economic policy, or social and national policy.\r\n\r\nI therefore urge the Minister to review this process in order\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  these divergences are minimised  in  future\r\n\r\nBudgets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second aspect is on distortionary effects. As\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, we would like fiscal policy to leave market\r\n\r\nforces  untrammelled in order to pursue their  self-interest,\r\n\r\nexcept  where  the  desired effect is to change  such  market\r\n\r\nbehaviour.   In  this Budget, one example where  I  feel,  or\r\n\r\nfear,  that  a distortionary effect is likely is in  the  tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  ESOPs.  I welcome the Minister's  announcement\r\n\r\nthat more will be done.  But I ask why the focus on the high-tech start-ups in particular.  I raise this question for  two\r\n\r\nreasons.   Firstly,  the  principles  underlying  ESOPs   are\r\n\r\napplicable  to  all  aspects of business  endeavour  and  not\r\n\r\nconfined   to  the  high-tech  sector.   The  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,   as  the  Minister  himself  has  said,  emphasises\r\n\r\ncomparative advantage through the use of knowledge.  That  is\r\n\r\napplicable whether a company is in the high-tech sector or in\r\n\r\nthe traditional sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this favourable treatment of ESOPs for the\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  sector will distort market forces and  lead  to  a\r\n\r\nfurther diversion of talent to the high-tech start-ups.   The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  already  pronounced  on  the  ground  with  many\r\n\r\ntraditional  companies  and SMEs  struggling  to  keep  their\r\n\r\ntalent,  let  alone  attract new talent.   If  we  have  this\r\n\r\nasymmetric  arrangement, then I think we will accentuate  the\r\n\r\nproblem  on the ground.  I therefore urge the Minister  that,\r\n\r\nwhen  making the announcement in May, he extends the enhanced\r\n\r\ntax treatment to all sectors of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, allocative efficiency. Sir, we would like\r\n\r\nto think that, when Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearmarks  expenditure to benefit particular segments  of  our\r\n\r\npopulation, it indeed reaches that segment of the population.\r\n\r\nIn  this regard, I have raised this question before and  wish\r\n\r\nto  put it to the Minister again, whether the use of HDB flat\r\n\r\nsize  as  a  proxy to distribute HDB service and  conservancy\r\n\r\ncharges  and rental rebates, GST offsets and rebates,  and  a\r\n\r\nwhole  slew  of  other rebates - I did a  quick  back-of-the-envelope calculation and it is about $73 million this year  - is  an  appropriate  proxy.  Would we  be  channelling  these\r\n\r\nresources  to individuals who need not receive such largesse?\r\n\r\nAnd  would we be depriving others who would benefit more from\r\n\r\nthe additional dollar?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, individually, these amounts are very small per\r\n\r\nhousehold, and it is likely to be like manna from heaven  for\r\n\r\nmany  of  them.   It is just another thing and  makes  little\r\n\r\nimpact  on them.  If we can aggregate some of these and  give\r\n\r\nit  to particular households judged to be needy, I think  the\r\n\r\nimpact  would be far greater,  psychologically, and  also  in\r\n\r\nterms of the social impact on their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to consider a two-tier system,\r\n\r\nif not for this year, then in the forthcoming financial year.\r\n\r\nOne,  where  we can adhere to this HDB proxy-based allocative\r\n\r\nsystem.   But the second tier can be channelled through  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils and Community Development Councils.  They are closer\r\n\r\nto  the ground.  They are in a better position to judge which\r\n\r\nhouseholds need this form of assistance and which do not, and\r\n\r\nthey would be able to administer the funds entrusted to them.\r\n\r\nI urge the Minister to consider this change.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, yesterday,\r\n\r\nmany  MPs have already expressed their disappointment on  the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  some of the rebates and concessions  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  budget and the negative effect it has, especially  on\r\n\r\nbusinesses  which have been badly affected  by  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   They need time and resources to recuperate  despite\r\n\r\nthe more than optimistic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  outlook.   I therefore do not intend  to  elaborate\r\n\r\nexcept  to  reflect  on how those who are  affected  must  be\r\n\r\nfeeling.  It is like someone who is drowning and the lifeline\r\n\r\nis  extended to him, but after he has been pulled out to  the\r\n\r\nsurface of the water, the lifeline is withdrawn and he has to\r\n\r\nstruggle  to swim ashore, that is provided he still  has  the\r\n\r\nstrength to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's reluctance to extend its assistance all\r\n\r\nthe  way to ensure the complete recovery runs contrary to the\r\n\r\nGovernment's pro-business stand and also not consistent  with\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister's assertion that the manufacturing  and\r\n\r\nservice  industries  should remain the twin  pillars  of  our\r\n\r\ngrowth engine.   If confidence is the main thrust of business\r\n\r\nsuccess,  the latest cut in the rebates and concessions  must\r\n\r\nhave  dealt a severe blow to the confidence that is so  badly\r\n\r\nneeded at this critical time of recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again, construction is the worst performer last\r\n\r\nyear.   While  I  am not overly concerned with  the  negative\r\n\r\ngrowth  in the construction sector (they may be cyclical  and\r\n\r\nwith the economic recovery, I am sure robust growth will soon\r\n\r\nreturn)  I am more concerned with the total lack of  progress\r\n\r\nin   the   standard,  quality  and  professionalism  in   our\r\n\r\nconstruction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, many MPs have expressed that we must all\r\n\r\noperate  business  at  Internet  speed.   Unfortunately,  the\r\n\r\nprogress  of the construction industry is still moving  at  a\r\n\r\nsnail's pace.  While other industries make progress by  leaps\r\n\r\nand  bounds, the construction industry stays stagnant and  is\r\n\r\npersistently  plagued  with  numerous  seemingly   unsolvable\r\n\r\nproblems.  It is sad to see that, in Singapore, our  building\r\n\r\ncost  remains one of the highest compared to other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries, such as the US, Europe and Australia, and the time\r\n\r\ntaken for completion of a project, one of the longest and, in\r\n\r\nterms  of  productivity, the lowest.  These create a  serious\r\n\r\nproblem to our national economy as it is an industry that  is\r\n\r\nconsidered  a pillar to our domestic economy and  contributes\r\n\r\nover 9%  to our GDP in the year 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I am greatly encouraged by the report\r\n\r\nsubmitted  by  the Construction 21 Steering  Committee.   The\r\n\r\nreport is thorough and comprehensive.  While I hope that this\r\n\r\nwould  lead  to  a  new era in our construction  industry,  I\r\n\r\nremain  cautiously  optimistic.   Through  the  years,   many\r\n\r\nstudies  and proposed measures have been made to improve  the\r\n\r\nindustry  but,  sad to say, with very little  success.   Till\r\n\r\ntoday, the same problems faced by the industry throughout the\r\n\r\nyears remain, and perhaps become more serious because of  the\r\n\r\nrapid pace of development and the chronic manpower shortage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By going through the Construction 21 Report, I have no\r\n\r\ndoubt  the  Committee  has identified most  of  the  problems\r\n\r\narising   from   our  construction  industry   and   the   39\r\n\r\nrecommendations have just about covered all, if not most,  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems  that  have  been the  cause  of  putting  this\r\n\r\nindustry   in  its  present  sorry  state.   But   the   most\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  recommendation on paper may  not  produce  the\r\n\r\ndesired result in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you a story which has been told to me by\r\n\r\nsome  contractors.  Some years ago, when the quality  of  our\r\n\r\nfinishing  was so deplorable, the authority recommended  that\r\n\r\ncontractors  who have obtained a project of  a  certain  size\r\n\r\nmust employ a certain number of skilled craftsmen, otherwise,\r\n\r\nthey would have to pay a levy or fine for every shortfall  in\r\n\r\nthe  number required. If I remember correctly, it  was  about\r\n\r\n$5,000 for each skilled craftsman. So the contractors went to\r\n\r\nsource  from Hong Kong the necessary skilled craftsmen.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  they  came,  after  working  for  a  few  months,  they\r\n\r\npractically  refused  to  work and just  laze  around.   When\r\n\r\nqueried by the project manager, they calmly retorted,  saying\r\n\r\nthat the manager should not complain for even though they did\r\n\r\nnot do any work by just sitting around, the contractors still\r\n\r\nsaved  a  sum of $3,000 because their wages were only $2,000.\r\n\r\nThis is the Hongkonger's street-smartness for you.  No wonder\r\n\r\nwe lost the SingTel deal!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little story illustrates the complexity and the\r\n\r\nintricacies of the industry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  to  implement  successfully the recommendations  by  the\r\n\r\nConstruction  21 Committee is no simple task.  It  will  need\r\n\r\nconstant  review  and monitoring and close  supervision  and,\r\n\r\nabove   all,   manpower   and   financial   resources.    The\r\n\r\nresponsibility to ensure the successful implementation of all\r\n\r\nthese recommendations is under the charge of the Building and\r\n\r\nConstruction   Authority   in  the   Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment which I notice has been allocated a sum of  $18.9\r\n\r\nmillion  for the fiscal year 2000.  To execute this  task  of\r\n\r\ntransforming  our  construction  industry  from   the   worst\r\n\r\neconomic  performer to a highly competitive global  industry,\r\n\r\nthis amount looks grossly inadequate, given the magnitude  of\r\n\r\nthe work involved and the importance of the building industry\r\n\r\nto  our  overall national economy.  I hope the  Minister  can\r\n\r\nfind some ways to allocate more funds to ensure that the work\r\n\r\nof  the  Construction 21 Committee will not be another  White\r\n\r\nPaper  that will turn into an academic study, gathering  dust\r\n\r\nin some storage space in the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many MPs have also brought up the importance of keeping\r\n\r\nup  with  the  IT, Internet age and that we have to  allocate\r\n\r\nmore  resources to develop an IT industry which can  make  us\r\n\r\ninto  a  global  player  in  the  information  age.  While  I\r\n\r\ncompletely agree that IT and Internet development would  have\r\n\r\na  greater impact on our lives than the industrial revolution\r\n\r\nand  that  we ignore it at our own peril, I want to  sound  a\r\n\r\nword  of  caution on our policy to nurture  a  new  breed  of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs  who  dare to venture  into  the  IT  industry.\r\n\r\nMeasures  such  as  the opening up of the  stock  market  for\r\n\r\nlisting  start-up  IT  companies,  as  well  as  the  various\r\n\r\nmeasures and incentives given to encourage venture capital to\r\n\r\nsupport IT start-up technopreneurs are most welcome,  but  we\r\n\r\nmust highlight, at the same time, that this IT business is  a\r\n\r\nvery   volatile  undertaking,  one  whose  future  is  highly\r\n\r\nunpredictable and full of swift changes.  I have come  across\r\n\r\na  documentary on Silicon Valley in the United States.  It is\r\n\r\nsaid to be a place where some of the richest people are found\r\n\r\nbut,  at the same time, it is also a place where many of  the\r\n\r\npoorest congregate.  The soup kitchens where\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndown and out people in the United States get a free meal  are\r\n\r\nwell  patronised  in the Valley, and in the  interview,  many\r\n\r\ndown  and out aspirants stated that they have lost everything\r\n\r\nwithin months of their arrival in the Valley.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have highlighted this because in Singapore, we have\r\n\r\nenjoyed  steady economic progress throughout the  last  30-40\r\n\r\nyears. Our younger generation has not experienced very severe\r\n\r\nsetbacks.   Now they are being presented with a rosy  picture\r\n\r\non  how one can become a success overnight and bombarded with\r\n\r\nthe constant vast exposure of how much opportunities are open\r\n\r\nto  everyone who dares to venture into the Internet business.\r\n\r\nThey  may be misled into unrealistic expectation that success\r\n\r\ncomes easily to those who try.  The reality is far from that,\r\n\r\nfor  every successful IT technopreneur, thousands fall by the\r\n\r\nroadside. While there is no doubt that the future lies in  IT\r\n\r\nand Internet business, we must prepare our younger generation\r\n\r\nfor  the  likelihood  of failure so that  if  they  encounter\r\n\r\nfailure,  their lives would not be shattered  but  they  will\r\n\r\nhave  perseverance and courage to stand up and  fight  again.\r\n\r\nMore  importantly, the Government has the duty  to  give  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  balanced information to remind  these  adventurous\r\n\r\nyoung entrepreneurs on the shortfall of such undertakings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember years ago when the Government encouraged\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  have a second wing by  investing  overseas,\r\n\r\nmany responded.  Some succeeded, but many failed and ended up\r\n\r\nblaming  the Government's vigorous drive in encouraging  them\r\n\r\nto  go  overseas.  Perhaps at that time, we have painted  too\r\n\r\nrosy  a picture of opportunities lying beyond our shores  and\r\n\r\nwithout, at the same time, pointing out the high-risk  factor\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  such ventures. Therefore, many have  found  out\r\n\r\nabout failure in a very painful way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are already signs that the euphoria of the\r\n\r\nspectacular  result  achieved  by  some  of  the  IT   listed\r\n\r\ncompanies are fading and consequently, many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestors will be hurt very badly.  It does not mean that all\r\n\r\nIT  dot.com companies are in danger of falling apart but  the\r\n\r\nability  to  sort  out  the  genuine  ones  from  the  purely\r\n\r\nspeculative ones is important for those who intend to venture\r\n\r\ninto this business, both as entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new millennium will bring about some very exciting\r\n\r\ntime for Singapore and I congratulate the Government and  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore for so successfully turning the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  around.  It says a lot for our Government's pragmatic\r\n\r\npolicy  and the will of our people to be united when a crisis\r\n\r\nconfronts us.  But I would wish that at times, the Government\r\n\r\ncan  be a bit more generous and understanding and ensure that\r\n\r\nwhenever they extend a lifeline to those who needed it,  they\r\n\r\nshould go all the way to ensure a safe landing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, before I\r\n\r\nbegin, may I have your permission to address the House on  an\r\n\r\narticle  in  today's  Straits Times  by  Ms  Chua  Lee  Hoong\r\n\r\nentitled, \"Do we really need 10 days to debate Budget?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short answer to Ms Chua is yes, and it is not\r\n\r\nenough.   But  let me first address some of Ms Chua's  points\r\n\r\nwhich I am sure are well-intentioned, if somewhat mistaken at\r\n\r\ntimes.   Ms  Chua is an experienced reporter of Parliamentary\r\n\r\nproceedings,   but   she  displays,  in  this   instance,   a\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding of what Parliament is about.   She  must  be\r\n\r\naware  that  Parliament is the public face of  democracy  and\r\n\r\nthat   the  executive  is  constitutionally  accountable   to\r\n\r\nParliament. Such accountability, like justice, must not  only\r\n\r\nbe  there but seen to be there. The Budget each year involves\r\n\r\nbillions  of dollars of public expenditure. This is the  only\r\n\r\noccasion  when  Parliament  has the  opportunity  to  examine\r\n\r\nclosely  the programmes of each Ministry and how it  proposes\r\n\r\nto use the funds allocated to it.  Members of this House take\r\n\r\ntheir job very seriously and file many cuts in order to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprobe and query how Ministers intend to use public funds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not just about feedback to Ministers.\r\n\r\nMs  Chua will, I am sure, be gratified to know that everyone,\r\n\r\nincluding  Ministers,  is  on e-mail  and  that  we  do  send\r\n\r\nmessages  to  Ministers.  But she must also know  that  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  public debate on such an important  matter  as  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  unless  she  and  the  public  are  satisfied   with\r\n\r\ngovernment behind closed doors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a full-blown debate, I think it depends on what\r\n\r\nthat  means.   We  have  never been  very  inclined  to  full\r\n\r\npassionate exchanges, except occasionally.  But it  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  there was no debate on the other occasions  as  a\r\n\r\nsedate debate is still a debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me come to the main point of Ms Chua's\r\n\r\ncommentary whether 10 days are necessary.  Let me put it this\r\n\r\nway.   If  Ms  Chua was a Member down here with  us  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber,  and if her cuts were the last in line, as mine  are\r\n\r\nin  one  case, she would wish the debate was longer  than  10\r\n\r\ndays  when  the guillotine comes down.  I hope that  Ms  Chua\r\n\r\nwould  take the opportunity to state that she does value  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of public debate in Parliament and  an  essential\r\n\r\nelement of parliamentary democracy in Singapore.  I hope  her\r\n\r\ncomments are not intended to belittle the efforts of  Members\r\n\r\nof  this House, the effort that we have put into this  annual\r\n\r\nBudget debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, may I return somewhat nervously to my\r\n\r\nspeech  on  the  Budget debate.  Sir, I  support  the  motion\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the new century dawns, we in Singapore are fortunate\r\n\r\nenough  to  find the economy turning around for  the  better.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  as  the Minister has pointed out, it is  a  V-shaped\r\n\r\nrecovery, not an U-shaped one.  Many who have heard the  good\r\n\r\nnews  expected the Budget to contain more good news  for  the\r\n\r\nindividuals  as  well as for corporations. In the  Minister's\r\n\r\nown  words, 1999 was a year of remarkable economic turnaround\r\n\r\nand the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsian  crisis  is  largely behind us. More importantly,  more\r\n\r\nthan  half  of  those retrenched in 1998  went  back  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce.   Asset prices rebounded strongly,  stock  markets\r\n\r\nsaw    strong    rallies,   consumer    spending    increased\r\n\r\nsignificantly,  prospects  are bright,  the  expected  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus  is $3.2 billion in financial year 1999.  It may  not\r\n\r\nyet be the best of times, but is certainly far from the worst\r\n\r\nof  times.   Singaporeans can say that they have entered  the\r\n\r\nnew  century with hope, at least with regard to our  economic\r\n\r\nwell-being.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the economic well-being or the\r\n\r\nprosperity of a country is an important goal for any country.\r\n\r\nBut  there are other goals that any first world country  will\r\n\r\naim  for.   One would be a high quality of life, in terms  of\r\n\r\ngood housing, pleasant neighbourhood and environment, vibrant\r\n\r\ncultural  life,  arts, music literature and  other  forms  of\r\n\r\nentertainment,  and  a  good  variety  of  quality   sporting\r\n\r\nactivities.   Then  there is the goal of human  security,  by\r\n\r\nwhich  I  mean protection, not just against crime,  but  also\r\n\r\nagainst  being  abandoned or destitute in  old  age,  against\r\n\r\npoverty, against ill-health and of course protection not just\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers  against accidents at work,  but  also  for\r\n\r\nfamilies  of those disabled workers. We may add the  goal  of\r\n\r\ninter-generational protection, that is, ensuring our children\r\n\r\nmust   also   have   a  good  education,  opportunities   for\r\n\r\nadvancement  when they reach working age. Finally,  there  is\r\n\r\nthe  all-important goal of national security,  which  is  the\r\n\r\ndefence against external threats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of all these goals is revealed in the way in\r\n\r\nwhich  expenditure  is  allocated.   The  Budget  signals   a\r\n\r\nrelative importance of these goals as reflected in the Budget\r\n\r\noutlays   allocated   to  each  Ministry.    Currently,   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure summary has four sectors:  security,  social  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  services, economic and infrastructural development\r\n\r\nand   general  services.   Security  includes  Defence,  Home\r\n\r\nAffairs and Civil Defence.  It takes up 5.79% of GDP.   Next,\r\n\r\nsocial  and  community  services include  Education,  Health,\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development and Sports, Information and the  Arts,\r\n\r\nEnvironment and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPublic Housing. This takes up 6.93% of GDP.  The economic and\r\n\r\ninfrastructural  development includes  National  Development,\r\n\r\nCommunications   and   Information  Technology,   Trade   and\r\n\r\nIndustry, Manpower, Research and Development. This  takes  up\r\n\r\n3.54% of GDP.  General Services take up 1.26% of GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one were to look at this table, one would say that\r\n\r\nsocial  and community services rank the highest in  terms  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  But on closer examination, we find that Defence\r\n\r\ntakes   up  the  highest  percentage  of  GDP,  followed   by\r\n\r\nEducation,  Public  Housing, Communications  and  Information\r\n\r\nTechnology, Trade and Industry and Home Affairs.   All  these\r\n\r\nMinistries have expenditure budgets ranging from 1.09% of GDP\r\n\r\nto  4.48% of GDP.  The budgets for Community Development  and\r\n\r\nSports,  Information  and the Arts and  Environment  together\r\n\r\nconstitute  no  more than 1.19% of GDP, and Health  takes  up\r\n\r\nonly  0.73%  of GDP.  If we say that the quality of  life  is\r\n\r\ndetermined   by   living  conditions,  the  environment   and\r\n\r\nencouraging the arts, we find that the expenditure budget for\r\n\r\nthis  amounts  to  only around 3.34% of  GDP.  This  includes\r\n\r\nHealth, Community Development and Sports, Information and the\r\n\r\nArts,  Environment and Public Housing, not  an  insubstantial\r\n\r\namount,  but  one feels may be legitimately increased,  given\r\n\r\nthe economic prosperity of the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the reason in pursuing economic prosperity\r\n\r\nif  not  to  improve  the quality of life for  one's  people?\r\n\r\nCrude though this comparison might be, it coincides, I think,\r\n\r\nwith the public perception that more can be done with respect\r\n\r\nto  the  goals  relating to the quality of life as  compared,\r\n\r\nsay, with the economic well-being or the national security of\r\n\r\nthe  country.  Many Members in this House have already spoken\r\n\r\nof the ways and means whereby we in Singapore can improve the\r\n\r\nquality  of life of those who live here.  But I wish to  echo\r\n\r\nthe calls of many Members that more funds should be allocated\r\n\r\nto  the  Ministries  that are involved  in  quality  of  life\r\n\r\ndevelopment  -\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistries   such  as  Community  Development   and   Sports,\r\n\r\nInformation and the Arts, as well as Health and Environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general point that I would like to emphasise here is\r\n\r\nthat  we probably should expect more to be spent on improving\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  life in Singapore and,  in  particular,  to\r\n\r\nensure that no segment of our society be left out of this so-called  fast,  speedy Internet world.  In  our  preoccupation\r\n\r\nwith  the  need to pursue a knowledge-based economy, whatever\r\n\r\nthat  is,  with  Internet speed, whatever  that  is,  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,     desirable.     Government     initiatives     for\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurship to flourish in Singapore is laudable.   The\r\n\r\ndemands  of  globalisation  and the  knowledge-based  economy\r\n\r\nhowever  do  not  just exact a change in  mindset  among  our\r\n\r\npopulation or training, but indeed require also a  change  in\r\n\r\nperspective  for both young and old.  It is very  fundamental\r\n\r\nthat this happens.  The dangers of disconnection, instead  of\r\n\r\ninterconnection, are very high, when it comes  to  those  who\r\n\r\nare  near retirement age or those who did not do well perhaps\r\n\r\nin the pursuit of their studies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is talk of a digital divide, but I find the phrase\r\n\r\nrather clinical.  It pertains more to the virtual world  than\r\n\r\nthe  real.   The danger is actually very real, in that  those\r\n\r\nwho do not have the drive or ability to engage in the digital\r\n\r\nworld  to  participate  in  the knowledge-based  economy  may\r\n\r\nbecome the new poor.  That is why I hope that more funds  can\r\n\r\nbe  allocated to the Ministries dealing with the  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife,  so  that they will take special pains to  target  this\r\n\r\ngroup of the potentially disconnected, and provide them  with\r\n\r\nthe  means to at least understand better the demands  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet age as well as its benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, moving more directly to the knowledge-based economy\r\n\r\nand  to  the  tax changes to encourage innovation, creativity\r\n\r\nand  enterprise, I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nchanges to the tax system are sufficient to stimulate the  e-commerce  sector, amongst other things.  One   of  the  major\r\n\r\nchanges  which  he  mentioned, for example,  relates  to  the\r\n\r\nincome  tax  concession for royalty payments.  The  exemption\r\n\r\nfrom tax of 90% of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngross  royalties  received, of course, is a very  significant\r\n\r\nconcession.   It  applies to authors and  composers  who  get\r\n\r\nroyalties  from  publishers, but now  extended  to  royalties\r\n\r\nreceived   from  recording,  film  or  drama   companies   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   As  for  inventors and  innovators,  the  income\r\n\r\nderived  from approved inventions, etc, would now be extended\r\n\r\nto  non-manufacturing sectors and to foreigners.  Being taxed\r\n\r\nat  only  10% of gross royalties is indeed a most stimulating\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have one problem relating to product\r\n\r\ninnovation.   As  defined, it does  not  include  a  computer\r\n\r\nprogram,  unless  it  is  in the nature  of  a  new  computer\r\n\r\noperating system, or new language used in a computer program.\r\n\r\nSir,  I find this limitation to section 10(10) of the current\r\n\r\nIncome  Tax Act far too restrictive.  It means, for  example,\r\n\r\nthat  Bill Gates with his Windows 2000 or Linus Torvalds with\r\n\r\nhis  rival operating system, Linux, could profit from such  a\r\n\r\nprovision,  but  no  one  else in  the  software  programming\r\n\r\nsector,  not the ones who write programs to improve  security\r\n\r\nfor  e-commerce transactions, not the ones who write programs\r\n\r\nfor  search engines to improve speed, not the ones who  write\r\n\r\nnew browsers, not the ones who write anti-virus programs.  My\r\n\r\nquestion is: why not?  For e-commerce to flourish, one should\r\n\r\nnot  only  be  thinking of companies such as Amazon.com,  but\r\n\r\nabout the many shareware writers, for example, who contribute\r\n\r\nto the vibrancy of the Internet, and provide the interest for\r\n\r\nmany  of  us  to see what programs these creative individuals\r\n\r\ncan  come  up  with.   Anyone going to Downlot.com  can  only\r\n\r\nmarvel at the true technopreneurs in action through a host of\r\n\r\nshareware  packages  available.  I hope that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nsimilar  tax  concessions  made in the  software  programming\r\n\r\nindustry  and  those who are about to embark on  their  first\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial project.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Budget this year seems to have attracted some\r\n\r\ngood comments but also some disappointments, but then that is\r\n\r\nto  be  expected.  Even on items such as the  5%  rebate  for\r\n\r\nindividuals, some have commented that with the alphabet, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"u\" comes before the \"v\", ie, the u-turn, in terms of cutting\r\n\r\nthe  rebate  by  5%, comes before the full  recovery  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.   This can be hard on those who are just within  the\r\n\r\ntax  net,  who  might have had to borrow  during  the  crisis\r\n\r\nyears.   I hope the Minster would take into account the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  recovery for individuals may not have been as quick  or\r\n\r\nas fast as the general economy on the whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that comment, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of  the  motion  in the name  of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The almost 40 Members who spoke before me have given\r\n\r\nmany  suggestions and requests to the Finance Minister.  Some\r\n\r\nfocused  on  the  need for more support for  families,   some\r\n\r\nasked  for more support for workers, and not a few for firms.\r\n\r\nIndeed, our economy has recovered in an uneven way that while\r\n\r\nsome  firms are doing well, some others are still struggling.\r\n\r\nWhile fewer workers were retrenched last year compared to the\r\n\r\nnumber  in 1998, there are still many areas where we need  to\r\n\r\nimprove  support for our workers in facing the challenges  of\r\n\r\nthe knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the Budget presented by the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nattempts  to  respond  to  a number of  long-term  challenges\r\n\r\nfacing us:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The problems of an aging population, and aging\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workforce;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The keener competition for investments, jobs and markets\r\n\r\nin the face of a globalised economic system; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The speedier changes of technology and the effects on\r\n\r\nour economy and our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Budget is a prudent and farsighted one. It\r\n\r\nis  not  a Budget to encourage entrepreneurship with  one-off\r\n\r\nmeasures  in  order  to develop a stronger domestic  economy.\r\n\r\nNeither is it one to just to give away goodies after we  have\r\n\r\novercome  the  recession.  No, it is not just  an  e-commerce\r\n\r\nbudget.  Thankfully, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbudgets  presented  in  this  House  have  been  consistently\r\n\r\naddressing  long-term issues.  There have  been  measures  to\r\n\r\nbuild   and  strengthen  our  small  State  with  no  natural\r\n\r\nresources to rely on.  Yes, our costs of doing business  must\r\n\r\nremain  competitive and we must have the skilled manpower  to\r\n\r\noperate  world-class infrastructure and man  our  industries.\r\n\r\nBut,  more importantly, and here I agree wholeheartedly  with\r\n\r\nDr  Richard  Hu,  that  we  have  to  use  our  resources  in\r\n\r\npreserving our social cohesion so that we can overcome future\r\n\r\ncrises and make our economy more prosperous for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin by stating the concern that I have over the\r\n\r\nchallenges to the cohesion among the races in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nhave a nation state that is multi-racial and because of this,\r\n\r\nit  is  delicately balanced; a society existing in peace  and\r\n\r\nharmony  because all the races recognise the stakes  and  the\r\n\r\nrisks  involved  if we cannot co-exist, live  together,  work\r\n\r\ntogether and play together.  Occasionally, we find the  lines\r\n\r\ndistinguishing the differences between the races  drawn  more\r\n\r\nclearly, lines that we ourselves have blurred through pulling\r\n\r\ntogether  through  hard  times and celebrating  through  good\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be on guard against actions and even policies\r\n\r\nthat  could cause frictions among the races.  However,  there\r\n\r\nare  also forces outside our jurisdiction that, with  perhaps\r\n\r\nmalice  or with ill conceived ideas, may have caused problems\r\n\r\nwithin  our own society.  When a term like \"Malay Malaysians\"\r\n\r\nis   used  in  expressing  unhappiness  with  Singapore,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  as  has happened in recent times, it  automatically\r\n\r\ninfers a reference to Chinese Singaporeans.  Immediately,  we\r\n\r\nhave the racial lines drawn and, immediately, it is no longer\r\n\r\na  relationship  between  Malaysians  and  Singaporeans,  but\r\n\r\nbetween Malays and Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reason behind it, it is not the main factor\r\n\r\nwhy  I  have brought up this issue.  I am concerned  with  my\r\n\r\nmulti-racial country and would not like to see a dent in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  cohesion  as a result of external factors.   What  I  am\r\n\r\ntrying  to  drive at is that we have to be on  guard  against\r\n\r\nevents, developments, statements, from external sources  that\r\n\r\ncould affect our multi-racial cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But social cohesion is not just about race relations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also  about  the  bond between  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and a good Government at that.  As  demonstrated\r\n\r\nduring  the two economic recessions that we have experienced,\r\n\r\npeople  unite when they face common challenges, have a common\r\n\r\ngoal, and a common hope.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from facing the social and political upheaval seen\r\n\r\nin neighbouring countries during the  economic turmoil in the\r\n\r\nregion,  Singaporeans rallied behind the Government and  were\r\n\r\nwilling to chip in to hold costs down and by agreeing to wage\r\n\r\ncuts.  They bear the fruits of their sacrifices now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as we all have heard, the problems are far from\r\n\r\nover.   As the economy develops into one that is based mainly\r\n\r\non  knowledge  and higher skills, a section of our  workforce\r\n\r\nmay  be  in danger of being dislocated.  These are the almost\r\n\r\n850,000  older workers who are in their 40s and  who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  secondary and higher education.  These are the  workers\r\n\r\nwho  will  be  vulnerable  to technological  changes  at  the\r\n\r\ncompany  level  and structural changes in the  economy.   The\r\n\r\nprogrammes of skills training, which among others include the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment  Programme  coordinated  by  NTUC,  are\r\n\r\nimplemented to help older workers acquire new skills so  that\r\n\r\nthey remain employable and able to secure jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is indeed very difficult to guarantee jobs for\r\n\r\nworkers.  But it would also not be acceptable if our  workers\r\n\r\nstill  find much difficulties in getting suitable  jobs  even\r\n\r\nafter completing skills upgrading courses.  I am afraid  this\r\n\r\nis  happening and we should be addressing this problem.   The\r\n\r\nfeedback we have been getting from some of these workers  who\r\n\r\nhave  lost their jobs is that employers still prefer  younger\r\n\r\nworkers  and discriminate against the older ones.   This  may\r\n\r\nnot be seen as a big problem now as we see more jobs being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncreated and more people are able to hold full-time jobs.  But\r\n\r\nif we want to maintain social cohesion at this level, between\r\n\r\nthe  people  and  the  Government, we  have  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  on  the count of age or  any  other  form  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination at workplaces does not exist.   If  necessary,\r\n\r\nwe  should look at the possibility of amending the guidelines\r\n\r\non  the  employment of foreign workers vis-a-vis older  local\r\n\r\nworkers.   I  am  raising this issue as it is  foreseen  that\r\n\r\nsubsequent batches of retrenched workers who take  up  skills\r\n\r\ntraining are likely to be older and probably would have  more\r\n\r\nproblems  getting  full-time jobs.  And  I  am  raising  this\r\n\r\nbecause  having jobs is the first line of our  social  safety\r\n\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy becomes even more knowledge-based and\r\n\r\ncompanies want to be more nimble and competitive, it is  also\r\n\r\npossible that more workers will be involved in part-time  and\r\n\r\ncontract work.  Most employers engaging such workers  now  do\r\n\r\nnot  contribute to their workers' CPF accounts.  I hope  this\r\n\r\ncan  be  reviewed  so  that our workers'  social  safety  net\r\n\r\ncoverage would be further enhanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances change in societies and especially when\r\n\r\nthe society becomes more sophisticated, through technological\r\n\r\nchanges and advancement of information technology, we tend to\r\n\r\nsee  some sections of our society left behind. These  sectors\r\n\r\nare  usually those who are less prepared, less adaptable, and\r\n\r\nmany  times,  less skilled.  In a technologically competitive\r\n\r\neconomy,  it is mainly our older workers who have  difficulty\r\n\r\nin  learning new skills and finding new jobs.  Yet we  cannot\r\n\r\nleave  this  group to flounder because they will  become  the\r\n\r\ntinderbox that can split our society asunder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways, it is the measure of a developed society\r\n\r\nthat is able to care for its weaker members.  I hope some  of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions offered by Members during these two days  of\r\n\r\ndebate  can  be taken into consideration by our Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n<br>3.16 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is strongly encouraging innovation,\r\n\r\ncreativity  and enterprise.  Over the last few months,  there\r\n\r\nhas  been  a  general call for Singaporeans to be  less  risk\r\n\r\naverse so as to compete in the big league in this globalising\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore no surprise that for this year's budget,\r\n\r\nFinance Minister Richard Hu reiterated the Government's clear\r\n\r\nintention   of   pursuing  this  change  of  attitude   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  announced specific measures  to  encourage\r\n\r\npotential entrepreneurs to hazard more risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are seriously considering venturing into the new e-businesses, principally because of the huge financial rewards\r\n\r\nthat  await  those  who succeed.  Stories about  millionaires\r\n\r\nbeing  made  every day in Silicon Valley stir our imagination\r\n\r\nand  fuel  our  dreams  of creating  the  same  wealth.  With\r\n\r\ntechnology convergence and emergence of a new economy,  there\r\n\r\nis  now a better chance of making it big than ever before  in\r\n\r\nour history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is required to succeed in the new economy? As\r\n\r\nreflected in the front page of the Straits Times today,  many\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House who spoke before me have asked whether\r\n\r\nwe  are ready for the new economy.  Sir, at this juncture  of\r\n\r\nthe  debate,  I would like to touch on the related  issue  of\r\n\r\nwhether  we,  both  as  a  society and  as  individuals,  are\r\n\r\nprepared for entrepreneurship and its consequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the recent success stories we hear come from the\r\n\r\nUnited  States.  We cannot deny that our young are very  much\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  American culture and the  American  style  of\r\n\r\nwealth   creation.   Throughout  its  history,  America   has\r\n\r\nproduced more entrepreneurs than any other society.  This  is\r\n\r\nin  part  because no other culture is as dedicated to  making\r\n\r\neach   individual's   dream  come  true.   American   culture\r\n\r\nencourages  the individual to decide for himself,  chart  his\r\n\r\nown  destiny and do his own thing.  It constantly reminds the\r\n\r\nindividual  to  be  all  he can be  even  to  the  extent  of\r\n\r\nrejecting  the  influence of other people  and  opposing  the\r\n\r\nexternal flow of events.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many of us, this idea can be disturbing as it\r\n\r\nconjures     images    of    rebellious    anti-establishment\r\n\r\ndisenfranchised spoilt brats who go around spraying  graffiti\r\n\r\nand  vandalising  cars.   That is one  aspect,  the  negative\r\n\r\nside.   To  derive  full  benefits from our  entrepreneurship\r\n\r\ndrive,  we  must manage the negative and tap on the  positive\r\n\r\naspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common story line in American movies is about the\r\n\r\nindividuals  who  cannot quite fit into his  environment,  is\r\n\r\nrejected  by his peers but yet comes back to save the  world.\r\n\r\nHence,  in Star Wars Episode I, the individualistic  Obi-Wan-Kenobi goes against the Jedi council to take on Skywalker  as\r\n\r\nan  apprentice.   Tom Cruise, the Maverick  in  Top  Gun,  is\r\n\r\ndefiant  towards authority but comes back to save his  fellow\r\n\r\nmen.   Bruce Willis in Die Hard, Sylvester Stallone in Rambo,\r\n\r\nClint Eastwood in Dirty Harry and the list goes on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are stories of self-determined individuals who\r\n\r\nhave  the  tenacity to pursue personal dreams  but  who  also\r\n\r\nthink  of  their fellow men.  Taken together, these are  very\r\n\r\npowerful   attributes  of  entrepreneurship.    I   hope   in\r\n\r\nparenting, and in our schools, we will not only emphasize the\r\n\r\ncreative  individual  in  our  young  but  also  the   social\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that come with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is that for every successful person who\r\n\r\ncomes  into  the spotlight, there are probably hundreds,   if\r\n\r\nnot   thousands,  who  did  not  quite  make  it.  For  every\r\n\r\nsuccessful  actor  like  Tom Cruise, there  are  hundreds  of\r\n\r\naspiring actors and actresses who sit day in and day  out  in\r\n\r\naudition queues and never got selected for a major part.  For\r\n\r\nevery  great golfer, like Tiger Woods, or tennis  star,  like\r\n\r\nPete  Sampras, there are hundreds of unknowns who grind  away\r\n\r\nbut never quite make it to the big league.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one strong point of the American system that it\r\n\r\nis  able  to  support and sustain a large group  of  aspiring\r\n\r\ntalents to produce the few truly excellent ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a small country like Singapore, can we afford\r\n\r\nletting  our  scarce human resources choose to do  what  they\r\n\r\nwant  with the risk that some, if not many, would never quite\r\n\r\nmake  it?   This would be a major shift from our, I  mean  as\r\n\r\nparents, paternalistic approach of directing our children  to\r\n\r\nundertake particular fields of study that will stand them  in\r\n\r\ngood  stead  to be gainfully employed with his or her  skills\r\n\r\nused to the fullest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we balance the need to plan, organise and not waste\r\n\r\nhuman  talent, with the need for people to be entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nand  hence to choose for themselves?  The danger is that many\r\n\r\nmay  end up floating around, experimenting and not succeeding\r\n\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To us Asians, the desire to strike it out on our own,\r\n\r\nand  be our own bosses, is not new.  And when we fuel it with\r\n\r\nwords  of  encouragement, financial incentives and especially\r\n\r\nthe promise of the pot of gold that awaits the successful,  I\r\n\r\nam  sure that there would be some who would naively take  the\r\n\r\nplunge into the world of technopreneurs even though they  are\r\n\r\nill-equipped and ill-prepared to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee sounded a note of caution at the\r\n\r\nrecent  NTU forum when he said that one should not go blindly\r\n\r\ninto  the gold rush of dot.com start-ups.  Risk must go  hand\r\n\r\nin  hand with research, with sound thinking.  In other words,\r\n\r\nthe risk cannot be for risk's sake, but must be calculated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those intending to venture out must consider carefully\r\n\r\ntheir   business  plans,  revenue  models,  and   competitive\r\n\r\nadvantages in starting their new business in the new economy.\r\n\r\nIn  this  new and untested world of e-commerce, some ventures\r\n\r\nsucceed  spectacularly, but many will simply fall  along  the\r\n\r\nwayside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we can minimise the waste of human talents not\r\n\r\nmerely  by  hanging  out  monetary incentives  and  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  but,  more importantly, by  proper  guidance  and\r\n\r\nassistance.   To develop successful ventures, we  need  sound\r\n\r\ninnovative ideas, good management, supportive partners, right\r\n\r\ntiming,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  a certain amount of providence for the many things  that\r\n\r\nlie beyond our control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can assist with some of these concerns.\r\n\r\nIn the world of e-commerce, alliances can be formed to create\r\n\r\na  buzz  among technopreneurs to share their experiences  and\r\n\r\nmistakes.   An  Internet association could be  set  up  where\r\n\r\npeople  can meet and exchange ideas and information.  Through\r\n\r\nsuch a forum, would-be entrepreneurs can find out what is new\r\n\r\nin  the market, what has succeeded and what has failed.   For\r\n\r\nthose who are thinking of taking the plunge, this would be  a\r\n\r\ngood  place  to  seek  professional advice  and  tap  on  the\r\n\r\nfinances  of  angels  and  venture capitalists,  and  on  the\r\n\r\nexperiences of industry gurus.  This can improve the  chances\r\n\r\nof success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my fear is that, if left on its own without proper\r\n\r\nguidance and assistance, our new economy may go down the same\r\n\r\npath as our traditional retail industry.  In the old economy,\r\n\r\nI know of some people who left well-paid jobs to start retail\r\n\r\noutlets.  It is a business that appears simple enough.   Some\r\n\r\nmistakenly thought that all they had to do was to  rent  some\r\n\r\nshop  space,  take some goods from the distributors,  display\r\n\r\nthem on the shelves and hope for the best.  But it is not  so\r\n\r\nsimple.   Many retailers are hardly able to make  ends  meet.\r\n\r\nOthers  are  profitable  mainly due to  good  location  which\r\n\r\nbrings with it good human traffic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, our Ministers have lamented the low\r\n\r\nlevel of productivity in our retail sector.  Likewise, if  we\r\n\r\nare  not careful and do not learn from our past mistakes, our\r\n\r\nnew  economy may be littered with run-of-the-mill  cybershops\r\n\r\nfloating  on  the  Web suffering from poor Internet  traffic,\r\n\r\nwhere  the  cyber equivalent of a good location is  a  catchy\r\n\r\ndot.com name.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, even with the best programmes, incentives\r\n\r\nand  assistance,  e-commerce and whatever other  enterprises,\r\n\r\nalways  carry a certain element of risk.  Our Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid at the last\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally  that  we must  \"accept  the  inevitable\r\n\r\nfailures  and  rejoice with winners who collect  the  pot  of\r\n\r\ngold\".   Both  these  limbs  -  accepting  the  failures  and\r\n\r\nrejoicing with the winners - are challenging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first, what does it mean for our technopreneurs\r\n\r\nto  accept failure should they choose to take risk  with  the\r\n\r\nhope of reaping the potential reward?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope they do not blame the Government for\r\n\r\nhaving  encouraged them to take the risk.  I am  reminded  of\r\n\r\nour  drive  some  years ago to go regional  and  develop  our\r\n\r\nexternal  wing.  Many companies heeded the Government's  call\r\n\r\nand   expanded  their  businesses  into  countries  like  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Republic  of China, Vietnam  and  Indonesia.   When\r\n\r\ntheir  investments  did not bear fruit, and  especially  when\r\n\r\nthings  took a turn for the worse as a result of the economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  we heard all sorts of complaints and grumbling  from\r\n\r\nbusiness people that the Government was somehow to blame.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely, this is not the spirit of a true entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nWe  have  heard  again  and again the term  \"caveat  emptor\",\r\n\r\nbuyers beware, being mentioned in this House.  We must  learn\r\n\r\nto  be less reliant on the Government and be more independent\r\n\r\nto  watch  out  for ourselves.  I am not saying that  society\r\n\r\nshould  not  support  those  who  have  failed.   I  am  just\r\n\r\nreminding  ourselves  that  we  should  assume  some  healthy\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  in whatever venture we  embark.   The  true\r\n\r\nspirit  of an enterpreneur is to take risks and to bear  them\r\n\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Finance Minister Richard Hu said, many talented\r\n\r\npeople  are  prepared to accept low or even  no  salaries  in\r\n\r\nreturn for equity stakes.  These stakes can be worth a lot of\r\n\r\nmoney  but only if the company is viable, goes for an IPO  or\r\n\r\nis  acquired by another company.  What if a risk-taker cannot\r\n\r\nsupport  his family while waiting for his shares to  increase\r\n\r\nten  or  a hundred fold?  What if the company fails  and  his\r\n\r\nshares  are  worthless?  In such a situation, we may  end  up\r\n\r\nwith a group of people who may not have received any income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor months or who have lost their life savings and are facing\r\n\r\nfinancial hardship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a society, we must support those who do not make it.\r\n\r\nHaving gone through the last economic crisis, such cases  are\r\n\r\nnot new to us.  During the crisis, there were some people who\r\n\r\nlost  their  jobs and their source of income.  The Government\r\n\r\nstepped  in  to help.  The HDB was asked to reschedule  their\r\n\r\nhousing loan repayments.  The Ministry of Education was asked\r\n\r\nto  waive  school fees for their children. We pulled together\r\n\r\nas a community to help those who were less fortunate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a difference in that when people lose their\r\n\r\njobs,  we  empathise with them because often it is  something\r\n\r\nbeyond the worker's control.  On the other hand, for the risk-taker, he is consciously leaving a secure source of income to\r\n\r\ntake   risks   that  may  pay  off  or  may  not   pay   off.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  I believe if we are committed  to  encouraging\r\n\r\nenterprise  we,  as a society,  should also be  prepared  for\r\n\r\nthe  consequences  of  failure.  As a  society,  we  must  be\r\n\r\ncommitted to help, nurture, and support these risk-takers  to\r\n\r\nsustain them and their families in difficult times.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  huge undertaking, the long term benefits of which depend\r\n\r\non the risk-takers themselves.  Why do I say this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question leads to the second limb of what our Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  at the last National Day Rally.   How  do  we\r\n\r\nrejoice  with the winners who collect the pot of  gold?   Or,\r\n\r\nput  it  the other way round, for our entrepreneurs who  have\r\n\r\ncollected their pot of gold, what should their response be?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the support and sustenance that society has given\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs to bring about their success, it will  be  very\r\n\r\nsad  if, when they have made it, when their company is listed\r\n\r\non  SGX  or NASDAQ, and they are worth a few hundred  million\r\n\r\ndollars, that they should pack up and leave Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am reminded of the great entrepreneurs of the\r\n\r\nindustrial revolution.  Men like\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCarnegie,  Mellon, Ford and Rockefeller.  These entrepreneurs\r\n\r\ndefied   the   values  of  landed  gentility  and   inherited\r\n\r\nprivilege,  had the courage and the determination  to  strike\r\n\r\nout on their own and transformed the world.  These men became\r\n\r\ngreat  through  massive  corporate  acquisitions  and  empire\r\n\r\nbuilding, and great again through massive charity.  We should\r\n\r\nfollow  the  good example set by these great  individuals  of\r\n\r\ncapitalism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to go back to the\r\n\r\nheroes  of American popular culture whom I mentioned  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of my speech.  Robert Bellah has pointed  out  the\r\n\r\nAmerican myth's hero \"again and again saves a society he  can\r\n\r\nnever completely fit into\".  The value of American heroes  to\r\n\r\ntheir  society is that they \"stand alone, not needing others,\r\n\r\nnot  depending on their judgment, and not submitting to their\r\n\r\nwishes\".  But this brand of individualism is not selfishness.\r\n\r\nIt  is  to be regarded as a kind of heroic selflessness where\r\n\r\none  accepts the necessity of being alone, of being different\r\n\r\nfrom  the  rest and of going against the system in  order  to\r\n\r\nserve the values of the community one comes from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us to succeed as a society in the long run and to\r\n\r\nmake  sense of all these incentives and assistance  given  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government, entrepreneurs who made it must feel the need\r\n\r\nto,  and  do  in  fact, return something  to  the  community.\r\n\r\nWhether   by   serving  the  community,   by   creating   job\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  other  Singaporeans,  by  giving  to  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  charities,  or  by  keeping  some  of   their\r\n\r\nbusinesses in Singapore and paying their taxes, I  hope  they\r\n\r\nwill continue to contribute in some significant way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the debate on the Budget Statement be proceeded\r\n\r\nwith  beyond 4.30 pm and the proceedings thereon be  exempted\r\n\r\nat  this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing  Order\r\n\r\nNo. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I cannot agree more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are seeing in the world today is a radical and\r\n\r\nfundamental  shift  in  the  economic  underpinnings  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.    Mankind   has  moved  from  its   hunter-gatherer\r\n\r\nbeginnings to the industrial revolution of the 17th  century,\r\n\r\nand  now  for the third time, into the new era of information\r\n\r\ntechnology.  Some analysts call this the \"Third Wave\".   This\r\n\r\nshift  is  most evident in advanced economies where over  the\r\n\r\nlast   quarter  of  the  century,  services  have   displaced\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  as the basis of generating  wealth.   What  it\r\n\r\nmeans, Sir, is that instead of working in a factory on a line\r\n\r\nproduction, the new age worker will find himself in a service-oriented line, such as process control, software writing,  or\r\n\r\nfinancial services.  Increasingly, instead of relying on pure\r\n\r\nsweat and physical labour, man is turning to mental endeavour\r\n\r\nas  a means of sustenance.  Production of goods and services,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  tends  towards  greater  use  of  automation  and\r\n\r\ninformation technology.  In many ways, one sees this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  a  manifestation of the knowledge-based economy  that  we\r\n\r\nspoke about not too long ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shift in the post-industrial society to a computer-driven knowledge-based economy has significant implications\r\n\r\nfor  us.   At one level, the force of the Internet  has  made\r\n\r\nterritorial   boundaries  and  local   jurisdictions   almost\r\n\r\nmeaningless statements in a way.  The ability of the Internet\r\n\r\nto  penetrate  and reach, with little or no  difficulty,  any\r\n\r\nconnected  home  or  office located  anywhere  in  the  world\r\n\r\nsuggests that any legislation to control or regulate its  use\r\n\r\nis  at  best  a  token statement of acceptable conduct.   As,\r\n\r\nindeed,  while  we have laws on pornography,  the  ease  with\r\n\r\nwhich any child can have access to such materials on the  Net\r\n\r\nis  often  seen as a mockery of what we try to  do.   In  the\r\n\r\ncyberspace,  space and time no longer present  themselves  as\r\n\r\nbarriers  to  communication.  As a result, the intensity  and\r\n\r\nfrequency  with  which  people are engaged  in  communicating\r\n\r\namong themselves give rise to a sense of community founded on\r\n\r\na  global  dimension.  Sir, we have become a global community\r\n\r\ncharacterised by a free flow of information and  exchange  of\r\n\r\nideas.   Out of this exchange, e-commerce emerged.   A  whole\r\n\r\nnew  dimension and manner of doing business now exists, which\r\n\r\nwas  never  before  possible.  Suddenly,  the  market  became\r\n\r\nlarger  and the competition keener.  The Internet has brought\r\n\r\nabout a greater flow of information, goods and capital across\r\n\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a society that is organised around information\r\n\r\ntechnology places greater emphasis on the values of  equality\r\n\r\nand  freedom.   At the workplace, a whole new office  culture\r\n\r\nhas evolved.  People go to work in casual clothes, sport pony\r\n\r\ntails,  call each other on a first name basis and also relate\r\n\r\nto  each other more casually.  On the Internet, the fact that\r\n\r\none  is  able  to  assume a different  identity  through  the\r\n\r\nfaceless   e-mail  addresses  means  a  greater  freedom   of\r\n\r\nexpression.  It is no surprise, therefore, that some  of  the\r\n\r\nmost  heated and candid expressions take place in cyberspace.\r\n\r\nThis is a virtue that Net surfers value on the Internet.  Any\r\n\r\nattempt\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  regulate the conduct of these chat rooms or even seek  to\r\n\r\npry  behind  the veneer of anonymity will be met with  almost\r\n\r\ncomplete resentment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, because the Internet is borderless, we are faced\r\n\r\nwith  the  issue of whether as a country we should go  beyond\r\n\r\nour   territorial  boundaries  to  regulate   the   flow   of\r\n\r\ninformation   coming  into  Singapore.   The   challenge   is\r\n\r\npressing,  indeed, if there are bigots out there sending  all\r\n\r\nmanner of misinformation which is calculated to undermine the\r\n\r\nracial and political harmony which exists in our country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the age of the Internet, we are confronted, at\r\n\r\nanother  level,  with  a global economy  that  has  radically\r\n\r\nincreased  the intensity of competition.  With the free  flow\r\n\r\nof  goods and services and even capital, no business  in  any\r\n\r\npart  of  the world, whether or not that business enjoys  any\r\n\r\nstate  given  monopoly rights, can be shielded  from  intense\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent publication of the Economist, it was\r\n\r\nreported  that what is truly revolutionary about the Internet\r\n\r\nis  its ability to generate different pricing mechanisms and,\r\n\r\nin  particular, to allow price and product comparisons to  be\r\n\r\nmade  and  various  kinds of auctions and exchanges  to  take\r\n\r\nplace.    The   Internet  provides  a  perfect   medium   for\r\n\r\naggregating buyers and sellers from all over the  world,  and\r\n\r\nalso  offers  an  excellent  way  of  comparing  prices   and\r\n\r\ncollecting  information.   Up until  the  revolution  of  the\r\n\r\nInternet,  the  process  of  aggregating  product  and  price\r\n\r\ninformation would have been a rather tedious affair indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the technology in this area is moving fast. At the\r\n\r\nmoment,  there  exists  in  the market  software  that  would\r\n\r\nautomatically inform the surfer of the best prices  that  are\r\n\r\navailable elsewhere.  For instance, with the software, if you\r\n\r\nare  about to buy a book from Amazon.com, a box would pop  up\r\n\r\nin  your  computer  which tells you that  you  could  get  it\r\n\r\ncheaper elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition that commercial firms face from Internet\r\n\r\nwould  mean  that adaptation and change in the way  in  which\r\n\r\nbusinesses are carried out must take place if such firms  are\r\n\r\nto  stay  relevant or, as some would put it, e-relevant,  and\r\n\r\nperhaps even to survive.  One immediate example would be  the\r\n\r\ntravel  agents.  Traditionally, to book a holiday, one  would\r\n\r\ngo  down to the travel agent's office to sort out the airline\r\n\r\nticketing, hotel accommodation, tours, and so on.  The travel\r\n\r\nagent  gets a middleman commission and that is the nature  of\r\n\r\nhis business.  Today, it would be possible to do all of these\r\n\r\nthings  through  the Internet without having  to  go  to  the\r\n\r\ntravel agent.  Does it mean that the travel agent will go the\r\n\r\nway  of  the  dodo bird?  Not necessarily.  If travel  agents\r\n\r\ncould,  and  for many they have, get around the  business  of\r\n\r\nadding  a  dotcom capability to their businesses, they  could\r\n\r\nwell  stay  relevant  and  even profitable  for  the  future.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly,  the line taken by many management  consultants\r\n\r\nis  that  big  businesses  that  fail  to  grapple  with  the\r\n\r\nconsequences of e-commerce are putting their company at risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the flip side, e-commerce on the Internet has\r\n\r\ntremendous  opportunities to offer to businesses.   In  1999,\r\n\r\nglobal  e-commerce  was worth a little over  US$150  billion.\r\n\r\nAround  80%  of the transactions was carried out between  one\r\n\r\nform  of business and another.  Indeed, the B2B Web exchanges\r\n\r\nare  expanding at a hectic pace.  The Economist reported that\r\n\r\nin  America, e-tailing revenues tripled last year; in  Europe\r\n\r\nand  Japan,  they  rose even faster.  The  most  obvious  and\r\n\r\nimmediate   advantage  of  e-commerce   is   that   Singapore\r\n\r\nbusinesses  need  not necessarily confine themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  market.  With the Internet, the world is their market,\r\n\r\nand if astutely thought through, e-commerce as an alternative\r\n\r\nbusiness model can radically expand their business horizon in\r\n\r\nmore ways than they can imagine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to give an example. I recently had a\r\n\r\nconversation with an economist in a research and  information\r\n\r\nagency.   This is a local firm that provides information  and\r\n\r\nanalysis principally to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions.  The economist tells me that  he  is\r\n\r\nvery excited about e-commerce on the Internet.  It gives  him\r\n\r\na far wider audience than what Singapore has to offer.  Quite\r\n\r\nnaturally, his company has a dotcom spin.  He tells  me  that\r\n\r\nif  he can gather 1,000 subscribers on his Web page, he would\r\n\r\nbreak even, and anything beyond that would be pure profit for\r\n\r\nhim.   When  the  world  is  your market  place,  Sir,  1,000\r\n\r\nsubscribers seem like an insignificant figure indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At yet another level, we must recognise and accept the\r\n\r\nway  in  which  the Internet revolution is  likely  to  cause\r\n\r\nsocial  dislocation.   Throughout  history,  any  revolution,\r\n\r\nwhether it has been brought about by technology or otherwise,\r\n\r\noften  results  in  some form of adjustment  and  changes  to\r\n\r\nsociety.  When industrial revolution took place, people moved\r\n\r\nin  a  massive  way  from the farming  communities  to  urban\r\n\r\ncentres  because  of new techniques of industrial  production\r\n\r\nthat  had  enabled higher output and thus gave the  people  a\r\n\r\nbetter  quality of life.  New jobs were created and old  jobs\r\n\r\nwere  made  redundant.  Those who could adapt to the  changes\r\n\r\nwere able to ride on the new wave of revolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if we accept that the Internet represents the\r\n\r\n\"Third  Wave\" of change to human kind, we should be  prepared\r\n\r\nfor  some form of social dislocation within our society.   As\r\n\r\nit  stands, information technology allows for a higher  level\r\n\r\nof   automation.   Smarter  machines,  such  as  robots,  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly able to replace human operators in the  area  of\r\n\r\nqualitative  decision-making.  Almost every aspect  of  human\r\n\r\nendeavour   is  capable  of  being  replicated  by  machines.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  as a country, we are faced with  a  population\r\n\r\nwhere  a substantial number of adults above 40 do not possess\r\n\r\neducational  qualification  beyond  Primary  Six.   It  would\r\n\r\nappear  that  if  there  is  any fundamental  change  to  the\r\n\r\nstructure  of our economy, which must invariably come  about,\r\n\r\nthe  people  who are least qualified to handle  such  changes\r\n\r\nwould  be at a greater risk of losing their jobs.  Some  call\r\n\r\nthis  structural unemployment, that is, unemployment  brought\r\n\r\nabout  when the economy restructures itself into a  different\r\n\r\nplane of wealth\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncreation.   How should the Government take care of the  well-being of these employees?  Looking at the phenomenal rate  at\r\n\r\nwhich  e-commerce expanded in recent years, the  prospect  of\r\n\r\nmassive structural unemployment hitting us in the near future\r\n\r\nis real indeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Francis Fukuyama in his book, \"The Great\r\n\r\nDisruption\", said that the social order once disrupted  tends\r\n\r\nto  get remade again.  He explains that we can expect this to\r\n\r\nhappen because human beings are essentially social creatures,\r\n\r\nwhose  most  basic instinct and drives lead  them  to  create\r\n\r\nmoral  values  or  rules  that bind  themselves  together  in\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Human beings are also rational creatures  whose\r\n\r\nrationality would lead them to find ways of cooperating  with\r\n\r\none another spontaneously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social order, as we know it, comes out of a centralised,\r\n\r\nrational, bureaucratic hierarchy that is very much associated\r\n\r\nwith  industrial revolution.  Max Weber, in fact, has  argued\r\n\r\nthat the rational bureaucracy, with its structured rules  and\r\n\r\nhierarchy, is the very essence of the modern life as we  know\r\n\r\nit.   However,  with the revolution that  is  brought  on  by\r\n\r\ninformation  technology,  governments  and  authority  should\r\n\r\nreconsider the way in which people are organised.  Some  have\r\n\r\nargued   quite   forcefully  that  in  the  new   information\r\n\r\ntechnology  age,  it would be difficult for  governments  and\r\n\r\ncorporations  to  rely  exclusively on  formal,  bureaucratic\r\n\r\nrules  to  organise  people over whom  they  have  authority.\r\n\r\nInstead,  governments  and corporations  will  well  have  to\r\n\r\ndecentralise  and devolve power, and to rely  on  the  people\r\n\r\nwhom  they have nominal authority to be self-organising.   To\r\n\r\nbe    effective,   self-regulation   must   depend   on   the\r\n\r\ninternalising rules of conduct which are consistent with what\r\n\r\nthe  government or corporation is trying to achieve.   It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore  on  the basis of such internalised informal  norms\r\n\r\nthat one expects to form the basis of social control for  the\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such changes of social order requires a paradigm\r\n\r\nshift in the minds of the policymakers.  It did not come as a\r\n\r\nsurprise to some that when SingNet\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecently allowed investigations to be carried out on  account\r\n\r\nholders  on the question of vulnerability of their  computers\r\n\r\nto  hacking,  there was equally an outcry by members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic that this was an unethical act by the Internet service\r\n\r\nprovider.   It  was seen by many as an invasion  of  privacy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any attempt to regulate conduct in a formal way is\r\n\r\nbound to be met with a fair measure of resistance on the part\r\n\r\nof the users.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, Minister George Yeo was asked in a press\r\n\r\ninterview  on  his  views  on censorship.   Implicit  in  the\r\n\r\nquestion  was  how  Government was able to reconcile  between\r\n\r\nhaving  laws  that  ban  pornography and  that  which  allows\r\n\r\npornographic materials to be readily available on the Net, as\r\n\r\na  matter of practice.  The Minister's reply, I thought,  was\r\n\r\npractical.   If I may paraphrase the Minister,  the  Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  essentially it is not possible for us to  monitor\r\n\r\nand  enforce  pornographic laws against  every  incidence  of\r\n\r\nbreach.   What  the Government should do is to  use  laws  to\r\n\r\nproscribe  such  action in the hope that  Singaporeans  would\r\n\r\nknow that such form of conduct is unacceptable and should not\r\n\r\nbe  encouraged.  Instinctively, it is hoped that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  not  engage in such forms of conduct because they  know\r\n\r\nthat it would be most embarrassing for them if they are found\r\n\r\nout.   Such  informal norms may be sufficient  to  exert  its\r\n\r\nsocial control on individuals.  In other words, if I read him\r\n\r\ncorrectly,  Minister Yeo is saying that it may be better  for\r\n\r\nsuch  rules to be internalised rather than to seek to enforce\r\n\r\nit in a formal way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taken the trouble to delve deeply into this\r\n\r\nsubject  matter as I feel that an event, such as the Internet\r\n\r\nexplosion,  which  is  going  to  affect  us  in   the   most\r\n\r\nsignificant way should play a major part in setting the  tone\r\n\r\nfor  our  debate  in  this budget.  If  we  accept  that  the\r\n\r\nInternet in general, and e-commerce in particular, are  going\r\n\r\nto revolutionise the society in a fundamental way, the way in\r\n\r\nwhich the society thinks and behaves,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfundamental  questions  about the way we  organise  ourselves\r\n\r\ntoday and the way we are going to organise ourselves for  the\r\n\r\nfuture should be asked.  These questions may span across  the\r\n\r\nentire spectrum of the subject matter of the Government.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  what  kind of rules do we want  to  have  and  how\r\n\r\nshould  these rules be enforced in the information technology\r\n\r\nage?   How do we begin to deal with technology whose  process\r\n\r\ncannot  be confined effectively within a territorial boundary\r\n\r\nand  thus  be  subject to the jurisdiction  of  the  relevant\r\n\r\nauthority?   Should Singapore actively promote  international\r\n\r\nagencies  to  help  regulate and police  the  conduct  of  e-commerce and the Internet?  With the explosion of e-commerce,\r\n\r\nhow  can  our  Government  play a more  significant  part  in\r\n\r\nhelping   Internet  start-up  companies  take  on  businesses\r\n\r\nelsewhere with a first mover advantage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the American government has in fact given a big\r\n\r\npush  to  e-commerce  in two ways.  If I may  just  highlight\r\n\r\nthem.   Firstly,  the  government permits  the  patenting  of\r\n\r\nbusiness processes.  Presently, e-commerce houses in  the  US\r\n\r\nwith  sound business models can look forward to some form  of\r\n\r\nintellectual property protection.  Such means of  protection,\r\n\r\nno   doubt,   would  greatly  lend  comfort  to   the   young\r\n\r\ntechnopreneurs   with   bright  ideas.    Unfortunately,   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  have  yet to extend our recognition  to  such\r\n\r\nprocesses as they do in the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the US government has helped by imposing a\r\n\r\nmoratorium on new taxes on anything bought over the Internet.\r\n\r\nWeb purchases are also generally exempt from sales tax.  I am\r\n\r\nnot sure whether we have made provisions for such exceptions.\r\n\r\nLooking  at our Government's Budget Statement, while we  note\r\n\r\nthe  potential competition that globalisation  of  the  world\r\n\r\neconomy  is  going to bring upon us, we have yet to  adopt  a\r\n\r\ncohesive and consistent approach to deal with the matter in a\r\n\r\nmore  comprehensive way.  For instance, if we recognise  that\r\n\r\nthere is a likelihood of a substantial social dislocation  to\r\n\r\narise  from the greater use of e-commerce, should we  not  do\r\n\r\nmore to ensure that those at greatest risk are given\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  to  prepare  them  for  the  changes  ahead?   Are  the\r\n\r\nexhortations of training and retraining of workers sufficient\r\n\r\nto   deal  with  these  concerns?   Or  should  we,  as   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  do more?  Should we, for instance,  allow  older\r\n\r\nworkers  double deduction of tax relief if they are  able  to\r\n\r\ndemonstrate they are taking up additional courses to  prepare\r\n\r\nthem for the new economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just some of the broad issues and I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister will be able to take up these queries  in\r\n\r\nthe course of the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I support the financial policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the new financial year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nunderstand  I am the last speaker on the row and  during  the\r\n\r\nbreak,  quite a number of Members have expressed to  me  what\r\n\r\ntheir expectations of the last speaker are.  I am not able to\r\n\r\nfulfill  all  their  expectations, but I  can  fulfill  their\r\n\r\nfeelings  and  I  will  try to be brief.   I  would  also  be\r\n\r\nspeaking on the feelings of a class of our population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will start off by first expressing\r\n\r\nthe   feeling  of  relief  this  budget  has  given  to  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in the sense that it has moved  away  from  the\r\n\r\nsombre tone of last year's budget, and this year's budget  is\r\n\r\nmore  optimistic.  We all like optimistic tones.  This relief\r\n\r\nis even greater because the economy had performed better than\r\n\r\nexpected.  Instead of a budget deficit for the last financial\r\n\r\nyear,  we  saw  a  surplus of $3.2  billion.   Instead  of  a\r\n\r\nnegative  growth of 1.4%, we saw a positive growth  of  5.4%.\r\n\r\nOur neighbours are also doing well.  All these are good news.\r\n\r\nThere  were external and internal factors for this turnaround\r\n\r\nand  the year ahead looks good.  The Government deserves some\r\n\r\ncredit  for  it,  and I give it to them for the  better  than\r\n\r\nexpected performance of the economy and for managing to get a\r\n\r\nsurplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the other factors for this\r\n\r\nturnaround had been the contributions and sacrifices  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  had  acknowledged this  group  in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nspeech.   I  thank  him for doing that.  The workers  rallied\r\n\r\nbehind  the Government's call for austerity.  I am glad  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has, in some way, recognised the contribution\r\n\r\nof  the  people sector by returning some of the surpluses  to\r\n\r\nthe  people through $100 million into Medifund, $200  million\r\n\r\ninto  ElderCare Fund, $385 million into the CPF  accounts  of\r\n\r\nworkers.    Then   there   were  other   new   measures   for\r\n\r\nstrengthening  family  cohesion and  for  meeting  retirement\r\n\r\nneeds.   The $250 into each worker's CPF account  is  a  good\r\n\r\ngesture and is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I attend international trade union conferences and\r\n\r\nmeetings, many of my union friends from overseas tell me that\r\n\r\nthey  actually envy we Singaporeans in the sense that we  can\r\n\r\nget  some  money  back  from  our  Government  surpluses   by\r\n\r\ncrediting  into our CPF accounts and to the Edusave  accounts\r\n\r\nof  our children.  In many countries, these are not possible.\r\n\r\nThe  taxes  that their workers pay from their  hard  work  is\r\n\r\nsquandered into mega projects which boost egos of politicians\r\n\r\nbut  are not economically feasible, or to enrich some people,\r\n\r\nor it just disappears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we also have to remember that our workers\r\n\r\nare  also unique.  I cannot think of any other place  in  the\r\n\r\nworld  where  workers will agree to a pay cut without  social\r\n\r\nunrest.   In November 1998, when the NTUC passed a resolution\r\n\r\nsupporting wage cut at its Delegates' conference, it was done\r\n\r\nwithout  much debate.  Union leaders had taken the effort  to\r\n\r\nexplain  the  problem  to  the rank  and  file.   The  ground\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  situation and there  was  some  trust.   Our\r\n\r\nworkers must probably be the only workforce in the world that\r\n\r\ntalks about employers' problems and try to help them in  real\r\n\r\nways.  It is reflected in the economic performance.  In 1999,\r\n\r\nour unit labour cost went down by 10%, unit business cost  of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing went down by 12% and productivity rose by 5.8%.\r\n\r\nThe  action of workers and their unions must have contributed\r\n\r\nto the confidence for investors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto invest in this country and for the economic turnaround.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when CPF was cut by 10 percentage points and\r\n\r\nunions agreed to wage cuts to maintain the competitiveness of\r\n\r\nthe economy, the Government also gave a package of reliefs to\r\n\r\nhelp  citizens cope with the reduction in income.   When  the\r\n\r\neconomy suffers, it is the working people that feel the  pain\r\n\r\nfirst.  Any reduction in demand for goods and services  means\r\n\r\na  reduction in overtime pay and reduction less take-home pay\r\n\r\nat  the  very  least, and loss of jobs at the other  extreme.\r\n\r\nThe  restoration of wage cuts has not fully happened  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector,  although the public sector  had  made  full\r\n\r\nrestoration.  CPF restoration is expected to take some years.\r\n\r\nThe   National  Wages  Council  has  not  come  out  with   a\r\n\r\nrecommendation this year.  Workers are patient  to  wait  for\r\n\r\nthe  better  performance  of the  economy,  as  well  as  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitive position to improve before going  for\r\n\r\nsubstantive  pay  rises.   The  Minister  should  have   also\r\n\r\nexercised  the  same  patience in  maintaining  the  personal\r\n\r\nincome tax rebate at 10%, and also the rebates on HDB service\r\n\r\nand conservancy and rental charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $250 into the CPF accounts of every active account\r\n\r\nholder  is a good gesture and has my full support.   However,\r\n\r\nworkers  would have welcomed more assistance in  helping  the\r\n\r\nworkforce  overcome  the sense of job  insecurity.   Business\r\n\r\nTimes of 21st January this year, carried a report of a survey\r\n\r\nconducted by a firm of head-hunters that, although wages  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  go  up, workers are generally unhappy  and  are\r\n\r\nworking longer hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, labour flexibility has to be balanced\r\n\r\nwith  job security through increasing employability.  I thank\r\n\r\nthe Government for the commitment to make manpower training a\r\n\r\nkey  priority.   I know about the many schemes  about  worker\r\n\r\ntraining, such as SRP.  I know of the $25 million that  would\r\n\r\nbe spent to make our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers more IT savvy.  I know there are incentives given  to\r\n\r\nemployers  for  the  training of the  workforce.   Even  when\r\n\r\nemployers  train,  they  are  for  firm  specific  functional\r\n\r\ntraining.   It is most useful if workers could continue  with\r\n\r\nthe same employer, or another employer, in the same industry.\r\n\r\nFor  workers  to  move  on to better  jobs,  they  also  need\r\n\r\ndevelopmental training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the lessons of the last recession is that workers\r\n\r\ncannot just depend on employers to provide job security.  The\r\n\r\nwhole employment relationship has changed.  To illustrate  my\r\n\r\npoint,  I  would like to quote the Business Environment  Risk\r\n\r\nIntelligence (BERI) who said in their 1996 Report:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The general expectation before the 1990s was that hard\r\n\r\nwork and respect for the company would result in job security\r\n\r\nand  progress  within the organisation.   Ratings  are  being\r\n\r\naffected  by  a  radical  change  in  this  viewpoint.    Top\r\n\r\nexecutives seem to be communicating the principle  that  'the\r\n\r\ncompany  is  offering no loyalty to employees, and  employees\r\n\r\nare foolish to offer it to the company'.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can look after the Singapore worker better than\r\n\r\nthe  worker  himself or herself.  The core workforce  of  our\r\n\r\ncompanies   is   being  reduced  through   out-sourcing   and\r\n\r\nrestructuring.  And of the non-core workforce, there are  two\r\n\r\ntypes.   One  is highly skilled, mobile and is able  to  look\r\n\r\nafter  himself.  At the other end, the worker is not  skilled\r\n\r\nenough or he is at risk of losing his or her present job, and\r\n\r\nif  he loses it, he has difficulty in getting another job and\r\n\r\neven if he gets it, the pay may not be as high as his present\r\n\r\njob.   By  the  Minister's  own estimate,  they  number  some\r\n\r\n834,000,  or 42%, of our workforce.  A good many of  them  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  CPF  accounts.  As more and more  jobs  are  being\r\n\r\noutsourced, more workers are being employed on a contract for\r\n\r\nservice,  they  are  employed as part-timers  on  fixed  term\r\n\r\ncontracts  and  other  atypical work  arrangements.   Workers\r\n\r\nwithout  CPF  accounts do not benefit from CPF top-ups.   And\r\n\r\nmost of the time, they are the ones who need them most.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  help  workers to  look  after  themselves\r\n\r\nbetter  and give support to the unions to help these workers.\r\n\r\nOn a previous occasion, I had asked the Minister for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nManpower   to   include   workers  in   atypical   employment\r\n\r\nrelationship under the definition of \"workman\" in  the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnions Act.  And in this way, trade unions can also represent\r\n\r\nthis group of workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a Chinese saying about giving\r\n\r\na  man a fish or teaching him to catch fish.  Similarly,  the\r\n\r\nadvantages of having skills are overwhelming.  It  is  better\r\n\r\nthan  charity.  Our workers do not want charity.   They  want\r\n\r\ndignity and self pride that comes from having a stable,  good\r\n\r\npaying  job.  The State will have to step in where  employers\r\n\r\nwill  not  do enough.  The arguments for giving all  citizens\r\n\r\npart of the budget surplus to educate and train are many.  My\r\n\r\nunion  colleagues had suggested a \"Skillsave\" account  to  be\r\n\r\npart of CPF to be used for training as the worker finds it in\r\n\r\nhis  or her best interest.  It would have been an appropriate\r\n\r\ngesture  of  recognition  if  the  Government  accepted  this\r\n\r\nsuggestion  and  transferred some of these  budget  surpluses\r\n\r\ninto  this  account.   I  strongly  urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nconsider  this  proposal seriously.  It will  not  cost  very\r\n\r\nmuch.   Giving every worker $500 for training will only  cost\r\n\r\nthe  Government  less  than  $800 million,  compared  to  the\r\n\r\nbillions in our surplus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's greatest asset is our people.\r\n\r\nDeveloping  human capital had given us the competitive  edge.\r\n\r\nI  fully  support  what  has been done  in  the  schools  and\r\n\r\ntertiary  institutions. I recognise that a lot is being  done\r\n\r\nfor  those in employment and out of a job.  Many workers  are\r\n\r\nanxious   and   very  concerned  with  the   new   employment\r\n\r\nrelationship and uncertainties it carries with it.   We  have\r\n\r\nto  help them.  Even more can be done for the people who have\r\n\r\ncontributed to Singapore's success -   the workers and  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br>4.32 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst,  let  me thank all the Members of the House  who  have\r\n\r\nspoken on the Budget yesterday and today.  But in view of the\r\n\r\ntime constraint, I can only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfocus  on major issues raised and leave matters of detail  to\r\n\r\nthe Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on tax cuts. Members such as Mr Ang Mong Seng,\r\n\r\nMr  Heng Chiang Meng, Mdm Claire Chiang, Mr Kenneth Chen  and\r\n\r\nMr Chiam See Tong have commented that the Government had been\r\n\r\ntoo  quick  to  scale  down the tax  cuts  given  during  the\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis.  There  is  disappointment  that  the   10%\r\n\r\ncorporate  tax  rebate  will be discontinued,  and  that  the\r\n\r\npersonal   tax  rebate  and  the  property  tax  rebate   for\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial properties are cut back from 10% to\r\n\r\n5% and from 55% to 25% respectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I presented the FY99 Budget last year, the\r\n\r\noutlook  for our economy was very uncertain, with GDP  growth\r\n\r\nfor  the  year  1999 forecasted at between -1  and  1%.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  taken decisive actions  in  introducing  the\r\n\r\n$10.5  billion cost-cutting package in November, following  a\r\n\r\n$2  billion  off-Budget package in June 1998.  We would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  prepared to do more if this was necessary.   As  events\r\n\r\nturned   out,   the   timely   restoration   of   our   cost-competitiveness   had  kept  businesses  intact,   while   an\r\n\r\nimprovement in external demand paved the way for  a  recovery\r\n\r\nwhich  gained momentum and became broad-based in  the  second\r\n\r\nhalf   of  1999.   Most  sectors,  barring  construction   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  are out of the woods.  Retrenchments  have  gone\r\n\r\ndown  drastically.  In 1998, 29,100 workers were  retrenched.\r\n\r\nThis  year,  this  fell sharply by 50% to  14,600  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  in 1999.  Based on CPF records, the average  monthly\r\n\r\nearnings  of  the  workforce in fact grew by  2.7%  in  1999,\r\n\r\nreflecting higher wage adjustments and overtime payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recession largely behind us, we have to focus\r\n\r\nour attention to repositioning our economy in response to the\r\n\r\nchallenges of globalisation and technology, while easing  our\r\n\r\nway  out  of the special cost-cutting measures. We  must  not\r\n\r\nforget  that  the  cost-cutting packages  were  meant  to  be\r\n\r\ntemporary measures to help companies and individuals during\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe economic crisis.  They were not meant to be the norm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax measures should not be seen in isolation. We\r\n\r\nhave   not   totally  withdrawn  the  cost-cutting   package.\r\n\r\nReductions  in  foreign worker levy have been left  unchanged\r\n\r\nfor  another year, to the year 2000.  Jurong Town Corporation\r\n\r\nand HDB will also maintain the rental concessions for another\r\n\r\nyear  to  the end of this year.  The property tax concession,\r\n\r\nwhich  was  already extended for one year earlier,  continues\r\n\r\nfor  another year, though at a lower rate of 25%  instead  of\r\n\r\n55%.  Even at 25%, the rebate is still significant, amounting\r\n\r\nto  an effective cut in the property tax rate by 3 percentage\r\n\r\npoints.   The  GST offset for individuals and utilities  rate\r\n\r\nrevision  offset  for  households  continue.  We  will   also\r\n\r\ncontinue with the assistance schemes under the HDB as well as\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  bridging  loan scheme and the use  of  CPF  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  to  help  home  buyers meet shortfalls  in  mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayments caused by the CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% corporate tax rebate was meant to help companies\r\n\r\nduring  the  crisis. There is no need to carry on  with  this\r\n\r\ncrisis  measure.  However, we should position  ourselves  for\r\n\r\nstrategic international competitiveness in tax. The corporate\r\n\r\ntax  cut of 0.5% is a cautious next move to maintain this tax\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 10% personal income tax rebate last year was given\r\n\r\nas   a  measure  of  relief.  The  pressure  for  relief  has\r\n\r\ndiminished.  The 5% personal tax rebate this year takes  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  modest FY2000  budget surplus of $2.5  billion,\r\n\r\nwhich  is significantly less than the budget surpluses before\r\n\r\nthe economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me stress that the Government fully recognises that\r\n\r\nour  workers had lived with the difficult years of  1998  and\r\n\r\n1999,  when some were retrenched and all have to take  a  CPF\r\n\r\ncut  under  the  cost-cutting package.  We  are  particularly\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  the  trade  unions  for  their  solidarity  and\r\n\r\nsupporting the CPF tax cut.  The Special CPF top-up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nannounced  in the Budget does not make up for all  that  they\r\n\r\nhad  forgone  in  CPF  contributions, but  is  a  gesture  of\r\n\r\nappreciation and recognition. This top-up will amount to $385\r\n\r\nmillion.  The  unexpected FY99 budget  surplus  has  made  it\r\n\r\npossible  for  the  Government  to  make  this  top-up.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment will also make transfers of $100 million and  $200\r\n\r\nmillion into the Medifund and the ElderCare fund respectively\r\n\r\nto  help  the poor and the aged with their medical  expenses.\r\n\r\nAfter  taking  into account the top-up and the transfer,  the\r\n\r\nFY1999 budget surplus is expected to be $2.5 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the economy recovers, we should revert to a\r\n\r\nprudent  fiscal  stance. The Asian crisis has  taught  us  an\r\n\r\nimportant lesson.  Other countries can turn to their  assured\r\n\r\nlarge domestic economic hinterland and natural resources  for\r\n\r\nlivelihood  in  times of hardship.  Singapore  only  has  its\r\n\r\nfinancial reserves to fall back upon. We need to build up our\r\n\r\nfinancial  reserves when we can, to make sure that when  hard\r\n\r\ntimes  hit,  we  have the wherewithal to deal  with  and  get\r\n\r\nourselves out of the economic crisis quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to address the other major issues\r\n\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong claimed that the budget surplus was\r\n\r\nnot  based  on  the total revenue received by Government  and\r\n\r\nthat the budget balance should include investment income  and\r\n\r\nproceeds  from  land sales.   Our budget  surplus  is  indeed\r\n\r\ndefined  as  operating  revenue  made  up  of  operating  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment expenditure and excludes specifically  investment\r\n\r\nincome  and  proceeds from land sales. The budget surplus  is\r\n\r\ndefined in this manner to ensure that Government lives within\r\n\r\nits means and does not live off the past.  Trying to live off\r\n\r\ninvestment  income and proceeds on land sales is both  unwise\r\n\r\nand  unsustainable. We have a limited amount of land in  land\r\n\r\nscarce  Singapore and investment income is needed to preserve\r\n\r\nthe  real value of our reserves.  Using up all the investment\r\n\r\nincome  will, over time, result in a diminution of the  value\r\n\r\nof our reserves.  Reliance on land sales as a source of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  revenue  is  a  two-edged  sword,  as  Hong   Kong's\r\n\r\nexperience  has  shown.   To  ensure  the  sustainability  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's budget, Government's expenditure each year  must\r\n\r\nbe  supported  by  the operating revenue  collected,  barring\r\n\r\nrecessionary  conditions.  No amount  of  reserves  would  be\r\n\r\nenough to sustain a Government that perpetually lives off the\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Leong Horn Kee, Mr Iswaran, Mr\r\n\r\nNoris  Ong and Mr Tay Beng Chuan had all asked why Government\r\n\r\nended  with  a budget surplus in FY99.  The FY99  Budget  was\r\n\r\noriginally  planned  based  on  the  circumstances   at   the\r\n\r\nbeginning of 1999.  As I said earlier, the outlook  then  was\r\n\r\nquite  pessimistic. The Government projected 1999 growth  was\r\n\r\nwithin  the  range  of  -1 to 1% and we  were  not  alone  in\r\n\r\nexpecting  a  weak  growth at that time.   The  Asia  Pacific\r\n\r\nConsensus  Forecast,  which polls GDP forecast  from  various\r\n\r\nprivate sector sources, had in January 1999 forecast a growth\r\n\r\nof  -0.8% for Singapore for the year.  Could we or should  we\r\n\r\nhave  foreseen  that the economy would register  a  steep  V-shaped  recovery  by the second quarter of 1999?  The  simple\r\n\r\nanswer  has  to  be  no, and neither did  anybody  else.   If\r\n\r\nMembers   believe  that  they  have  a  magic   formula   for\r\n\r\nforecasting economic recoveries, I hope that they will  share\r\n\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Government  did not set out to  achieve  a  budget\r\n\r\nsurplus and was prepared to spend much more when necessary to\r\n\r\nstimulate   the  economy.   As  I  have  said  earlier,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment introduced two off-Budget support packages in June\r\n\r\nand  in  November 1998 as our economy slipped into recession.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the $2 billion package in June was entirely borne\r\n\r\nby  the  Government,  while  the  $10.5  billion  package  in\r\n\r\nNovember  contained substantial cuts in Government taxes  and\r\n\r\nlevies.    At  the  same  time,  a  contingency  package   of\r\n\r\nadditional  public  sector expenditure was  put  together  to\r\n\r\nprovide support for the economy if conditions worsened in the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  1999, and additional jobs had to  be  created  to\r\n\r\nprovide  employment  for retrenched  workers.   It  was  this\r\n\r\ncombination of an anticipated low revenue collection in a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlow-growth  economy, coupled with substantial  tax  and  levy\r\n\r\ncuts  and increased provisions for contingency spending which\r\n\r\nled to the forecast of a budget deficit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as it turned out, our economy grew by a\r\n\r\nrespectable  5.4%  in  1999  due  to  the  upturn  in  global\r\n\r\nelectronics  demand and the strong rebound  of  the  regional\r\n\r\neconomies.   This  was an increase of more  than  5%  in  GDP\r\n\r\ngrowth over our FY99 Budget forecast.  Our operating revenue,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  strongly  correlated to  the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy,  turned  out to be much higher  than  we  originally\r\n\r\nexpected.  This,  coupled with the lower  tender  prices  for\r\n\r\nmajor  development projects and the non-acceleration of  some\r\n\r\nlower priority projects, led to the large swing in the budget\r\n\r\nposition.  No magic is involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the budget surplus outcome was something we could\r\n\r\nnot  have foreseen, but neither is it something that we  need\r\n\r\nto be ashamed of. The budget surplus is a happy outcome as it\r\n\r\nis the result of the strong and speedy V-shaped recovery from\r\n\r\nthe  crisis.  There was no reason for the Government to spend\r\n\r\nfrivolously  just to avoid showing this surplus.  This  would\r\n\r\nnot be in the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Government expenditure on Defence, Education and\r\n\r\nTraining,  Mr  J B Jeyaretnam said that we are spending  more\r\n\r\nand  more  on  Defence. As I have explained to Mr  Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nlast  year, as Singapore's GDP increases over the  years,  in\r\n\r\nabsolute  dollars,  we  would then  spend  more  on  national\r\n\r\ndefence  naturally. The safety of our people and all that  we\r\n\r\nhave worked for and saved all these years will be at stake if\r\n\r\nwe do not maintain a strong military defence capability.\r\n\r\nMr  Jeyaretnam  also accused the Government of only  training\r\n\r\nthe  workers  when  they are old, instead of  when  they  are\r\n\r\nyoung.   In  FY2000, our Budget for the Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry of Manpower will increase by 70%  and  68%\r\n\r\nrespectively.  And this is not lip service.  This  Government\r\n\r\nhas recognised right from the beginning the importance of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvesting   in   our  children.  We  have   been   advocating\r\n\r\nmeritocracy from the very beginning since our independence so\r\n\r\nthat  no child will be deprived of the opportunity to  go  to\r\n\r\nschool and to develop to his or her very best potential  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they come from poor families.  We have long  sounded\r\n\r\nthe  clarion  call for our workers to train and retrain,  and\r\n\r\nput in place a full range of supporting schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr Simon Tay and Mr Tay Beng Chuan\r\n\r\nhave  urged that Government should bring forward construction\r\n\r\nprojects  to  support the growth of the economy.   Government\r\n\r\nhad,  at  the  beginning of FY99, set  aside  funds  for  new\r\n\r\nprojects  that  may be needed to help stimulate  the  economy\r\n\r\nduring  the  course  of  the  year.   Such  projects  involve\r\n\r\nbuilding  infrastructure earlier than they are needed.   They\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  been considered under normal circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever, once it became clear in the course of 1999 that  the\r\n\r\neconomy  was  recovering strongly, it did not make  sense  to\r\n\r\nimplement  these projects, as doing so will only incur  costs\r\n\r\nfor  a  marginal  gain in the face of an  economy  which  was\r\n\r\nalready  turning around.  Members of this House may  wish  to\r\n\r\nnote  that for our economy, external demand makes up  75%  of\r\n\r\ntotal demand.  So, stimulating the domestic economy has quite\r\n\r\na small effect on our GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen again and Mr Lew Syn Pau have commented\r\n\r\nthat  the $979 million set aside for new projects in FY  2000\r\n\r\nwas  unusual.   I  can  assure them  that  there  is  nothing\r\n\r\n\"unusual\"  about a provision for new projects.  There  was  a\r\n\r\nsimilar provision of about $1 billion in the FY99 budget.   I\r\n\r\nshould  explain what is meant by new projects.  New  projects\r\n\r\nare  projects that are already on the drawing board, and  for\r\n\r\nwhich  some details have been drawn up.  However,  they  have\r\n\r\nnot  yet been approved by the Development Planning  Committee\r\n\r\nand are thus classified as new projects.  When these projects\r\n\r\nare approved and initiated in the course of the year, funding\r\n\r\nhas to be provided for them.  Viewed in this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperspective, the amount set aside for these new programmes is\r\n\r\nnot  large,  as  it constitutes less than  8%  of  the  total\r\n\r\ndevelopment budget for the fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Restoration of CPF cut and the special CPF top-up</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang has argued that the Government was\r\n\r\nbenefiting at the expense of workers with their CPF cut,  and\r\n\r\nhence  Government policy had resulted in a win-win  situation\r\n\r\nfor  the Government and a lose-lose situation for the people.\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Low Thia Khiang has got the cause\r\n\r\nand effect all mixed up.  The CPF rate was reduced during the\r\n\r\ncrisis   to   lower   our   business   costs,   improve   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and help to save jobs.  That was its  primary\r\n\r\nobjective.   Every company that decides to  relocate  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  because other countries in the region have  become\r\n\r\nsignificantly   cheaper  due  to  the  weakening   of   their\r\n\r\ncurrencies  relative  to  the  Singapore  dollar  during  the\r\n\r\neconomic crisis, would represent a permanent loss of jobs for\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The CPF cut was the single most important measure\r\n\r\nnecessary  to improve our cost competitiveness and to  retain\r\n\r\njobs.   Without the CPF cut, more workers would have suffered\r\n\r\nas  companies  retrenched or closed down.  The  cost  cutting\r\n\r\npackage  played a critical role in helping to get us  out  of\r\n\r\nthe  crisis quickly.  The higher tax collection is the direct\r\n\r\nresult of the strong economic rebound and the timely measures\r\n\r\ntaken  by  the Government.  The higher income tax  collection\r\n\r\ncould  only come from higher profits and wages, generated  by\r\n\r\nour  people  having  real  jobs,  producing  real  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices which the world finds worth buying.  It is therefore\r\n\r\ncontorted and invidious logic to suggest that the CPF cut  is\r\n\r\nan  exercise aimed at transferring monies from the people  to\r\n\r\nthe Government's pocket.  Ultimately, we should remember that\r\n\r\nthe  accumulated reserves belong to the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand not to the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng, Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr Chiam See Tong\r\n\r\nhave  urged that the CPF rate cut should be restored  faster.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n10%  CPF  cut, which took effect from 1st January  1999,  was\r\n\r\noriginally planned to stay for two years.  This period  would\r\n\r\nallow  the  economy to regain its cost competitiveness.  Once\r\n\r\nthe  economy  had  recovered, the cut will  be  progressively\r\n\r\nreduced.  Given the faster than expected rebound, restoration\r\n\r\nof  the CPF cut was brought forward to April 2000, instead of\r\n\r\nafter two years.  However, in order not to prematurely derail\r\n\r\nour  business competitiveness and the economic recovery,  the\r\n\r\npace  and quantum of the restoration have to be gradual.   It\r\n\r\ntook us five years and four months to restore the CPF cut  in\r\n\r\nthe  1985 recession, with the first step taken only after  28\r\n\r\nmonths.   We  are now taking our first step this  time  after\r\n\r\njust 15 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Peh Chin Hua have asked why the CPF\r\n\r\ntop-up  could not have been made bigger.  I should point  out\r\n\r\nthat  the  special  CPF  top-up is  not  meant  to  fully  or\r\n\r\nsignificantly compensate for the CPF cut, as doing  so  would\r\n\r\ndefeat  the purpose of the cut in the first place.   Instead,\r\n\r\nit  is  given  to recognise the sacrifice of the  workers  in\r\n\r\naccepting CPF and wage cuts to help lift the economy  out  of\r\n\r\nthe recession.  The quantum of the top-up is in line with top-ups given by Government in earlier years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo has asked that retirees and retrenched workers\r\n\r\nshould  be  given  a  grace period  to  make  their  one  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution so as to receive the $250 special CPF top-up.  I\r\n\r\nshould  point out that the special CPF top-up is targeted  at\r\n\r\nthose who had been directly affected by the wage and CPF cuts\r\n\r\nand  by retrenchments.  It is both reasonable and appropriate\r\n\r\nthat  the  special  CPF  top-up should  be  extended  to  the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  had worked, and therefore  contributed  to\r\n\r\nCPF,  any time in the 1998 and 1999 period.  This will  cover\r\n\r\nthose  who had been retrenched or retired during this period.\r\n\r\nAllowing  Singaporeans to top up their CPF accounts in  order\r\n\r\nto  qualify for the special CPF top-up will detract from  the\r\n\r\npurpose of the exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civil service pay</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and Mr Low Thia Khiang have expressed\r\n\r\nconcern over civil service\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npay.   Mr  Tay asked why, when the CPF cut has not  yet  been\r\n\r\nfully  reinstated,  the civil service should  be  reinstating\r\n\r\nits full pay cut.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the civil service is only\r\n\r\nrestoring the pay cut made on 1st January last year, when the\r\n\r\ncivil  service took the lead in implementing pay  cuts.   The\r\n\r\nCPF/pay  cut for civil servants is still in place, just  like\r\n\r\nall other Singaporean workers.  I also want to point out that\r\n\r\ncontrary to what Mr Tay believes, civil service pay  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  fully  restored.  The cut to the  monthly  salaries  of\r\n\r\ncivil servants made on 1st January 1999 up to 5% was restored\r\n\r\non  1st January 2000.  The total annual package has yet to be\r\n\r\nfully   restored.   This  is  because  the  annual   variable\r\n\r\ncomponent (AVC), which was cut from two months to 0.75 months\r\n\r\nin  1998,  was  only built up to one month in  1999.   If  we\r\n\r\ninclude  the 0.25 month special bonus that was paid to  civil\r\n\r\nservants  last  year, the total annual package (14.25  months\r\n\r\nincluding a one month annual wage supplement, a one month AVC\r\n\r\nand  0.25  month special bonus for 1998) is still 0.75  month\r\n\r\nless than the 15-month package paid in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to restore civil service pay cuts took into\r\n\r\naccount the recovery in the economy, the need to attract  and\r\n\r\nretain  talent  and  to maintain the high quality  of  public\r\n\r\nservice  and  Government.  Based on CPF records, the  average\r\n\r\nmonthly  earnings  of the entire workforce,  including  civil\r\n\r\nservants  whose wages fell, grew by 2.7% in 1999,  reflecting\r\n\r\nhigher  wage adjustments and overtime payments.  In fact,  in\r\n\r\nthe last quarter of 1999, the average monthly earnings of the\r\n\r\nworkforce  was 5.9% higher than in the same period  one  year\r\n\r\nago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in manpower expenditure for FY2000 appears\r\n\r\nlarge  at 10.8%, because it is compared against a lower  base\r\n\r\nof  FY99,  which included the CPF and salary cuts  for  civil\r\n\r\nservants and political appointments.  The partial restoration\r\n\r\nof  these  cuts  accounted for the bulk of  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nmanpower expenditure by more than 8 percentage points out  of\r\n\r\nthe   10.8%  increase.   Discounting  the  restoration,   the\r\n\r\nincrease in manpower expenditure is only 2%, which is lower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan  the projected GDP growth.  This is mainly due to normal\r\n\r\nsalary  increments.  Government is committed to  keeping  the\r\n\r\ncivil  service lean and trim and, over the years, has  farmed\r\n\r\nout   non-essential  services  to  the  private  sector   and\r\n\r\nharnessed  IT to bring about added efficiencies.   This  will\r\n\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Corporate tax</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan has asked why was the corporate tax\r\n\r\ncut  of  0.5%  not  applied  with effect  from  the  Year  of\r\n\r\nAssessment  2000,  rather than from the  Year  of  Assessment\r\n\r\n2001.   As  I have explained earlier, the 0.5% corporate  tax\r\n\r\ncut  is  not  a replacement for the 10% corporate tax  rebate\r\n\r\ngranted during the crisis.  The tax cut is intended to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our tax rates remain competitive.  A 1/2% tax cut  will\r\n\r\ntherefore take effect from the next Year of Assessment, which\r\n\r\nfollows  our normal practice when making adjustments  to  our\r\n\r\ntax rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we will be cutting our corporate tax rate\r\n\r\nfurther,  I  had  announced in the FY93  budget  debate  that\r\n\r\nGovernment's  medium term target rate for  corporate  tax  is\r\n\r\n25%. We are now very close to this target.  But I cannot  say\r\n\r\nhow low our corporate tax rates will be in future, as it will\r\n\r\nalso  depend on what other countries do.  What we do know  is\r\n\r\nthat  we will have to do whatever is necessary to compete  to\r\n\r\nattract  investments  and  talent  to  locate  and  stay   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Government's Role in the New Economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have expressed disappointment that the Budget\r\n\r\ndoes not appear to address the transition to the new economy.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think this is a misperception.   While\r\n\r\nthere  may  not  be  many new initiatives  announced  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  this is because Government had recognised  the  need\r\n\r\nearly  and has already launched many initiatives.   We  have,\r\n\r\nover  the  past  years, put in place and  are  continuing  to\r\n\r\nsupport   many   programmes  covering  education,   training,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure and manpower development.  These  include  the\r\n\r\nIT Master Plan in the schools,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThinking Schools, Learning Nation Vision, Manpower 21 and the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok has asked how Government intends to\r\n\r\npromote growth in the new economy.  Mr Speaker, Sir, the  new\r\n\r\neconomy, as exemplified by the United States, is one in which\r\n\r\nproductive  investments, deregulation and the  leveraging  of\r\n\r\ntechnology  raises productivity, and allows  higher  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth at low inflation. This is what our Government hopes to\r\n\r\nachieve  by  developing Singapore into a globally competitive\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy.  To this end, as mentioned in  my  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement,  we  will actively pursue the economic  strategies\r\n\r\nmapped  out  by  the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness\r\n\r\n(CSC).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important key to Singapore's success in the new\r\n\r\neconomy   is   innovation  and  enterprise,  creativity   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneurism. What Government can and should do to promote\r\n\r\ninnovation   and  enterprise  is  capability-building.   This\r\n\r\nexplains  our  heavy  investments to educate  and  train  our\r\n\r\nchildren  and workers, and the continuous effort to fine-tune\r\n\r\nour  education system and workers' training. This is so  that\r\n\r\nthey  will have the ability and attitude to constantly  learn\r\n\r\nand  adapt in the new economy. We must never forget that  the\r\n\r\nmajority  of our people will still be employees, and  only  a\r\n\r\nminority will strike out on their own as entrepreneurs.  But,\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to prosper, we need every Singaporean  -  not\r\n\r\njust entrepreneurs but employees as well - to be enterprising\r\n\r\nand innovative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage entrepreneurship, Government launched the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneurship 21 or T21 initiative last year. Under  T21,\r\n\r\nwe  aim  to  create  a  pro-enterprise  environment,  enhance\r\n\r\nventure  investment  and financing in  Singapore,  provide  a\r\n\r\nconducive environment for talent to congregate, and infuse in\r\n\r\nthe  population a culture of innovation and enterprise.  Thus\r\n\r\nfar,  we  have,  among  others,  introduced  a  Technopreneur\r\n\r\nInvestment  tax  incentive  and  Qualified  Employees   Stock\r\n\r\nOptions Scheme, allowed technopreneur home offices, set up  a\r\n\r\nUS$1 billion Technopreneurship Investment Fund (TIF) to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndraw   more  venture  capital  activities  and  talents  into\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  revised  the  Bankruptcy  law.    NSTB   and\r\n\r\npartnering agencies are in the process of working on the next\r\n\r\nwave  of  T21 implementation, and a second set of changes  in\r\n\r\nrules and regulations will be forthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Helping workers adapt to knowledge-based economy</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, including Dr Tan Boon Wan, Dr Ong Chit Chung,\r\n\r\nMr  Hawazi Daipi, Mr Seng Han Thong and Mr Ong Ah Heng,  have\r\n\r\nasked  for more measures to help especially the less educated\r\n\r\nor older workers cope with the demands of the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  accords   high\r\n\r\npriority and has already put in place many assistance schemes\r\n\r\nto  encourage the training and retraining of our workers. For\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  of  the  technical  skills  of  workers,  the\r\n\r\nInitiative  for New Technology (INTECH) programme  under  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Assistance Scheme (EDAS) has a total  of\r\n\r\n$800  million.  As  part of the Manpower 21  initiative,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   has  also  launched  a  $200  million   Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Assistance  Scheme  (MDAS)  to  promote   skills\r\n\r\nupgrading  for the lower-skilled workers. Under the  MDAS,  a\r\n\r\nbudget  of $110 million is allocated to Workforce Development\r\n\r\nProgramme,  comprising  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme  for\r\n\r\nunskilled  and semi-skilled mid-career workers, and Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower Conversion Programme for professionals. A budget  of\r\n\r\n$40  million is earmarked for the development of the National\r\n\r\nSkills  Recognition System to establish and train workers  in\r\n\r\nclear  standards  of  competency.  The  Government  is   also\r\n\r\nproviding   $50   million  for  MOM   to   develop   learning\r\n\r\ninfrastructure to assist and facilitate industries  to  build\r\n\r\nup their own capabilities to provide training for workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the abundance of schemes to help workers' training\r\n\r\nand  retraining, there is no pressing need to give  more  tax\r\n\r\nincentives,  such as double tax deduction,  on  training.   A\r\n\r\ndouble  tax  deduction  scheme  will  benefit  primarily  the\r\n\r\nprofitable and bigger companies, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill provide only limited help to the loss-making and smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies. Larger companies, defined as those with more  than\r\n\r\n500  employees,  currently spend about  6.3%  of  payroll  on\r\n\r\ntraining, whereas the figure for smaller companies with  less\r\n\r\nthan  50  employees  is  2.3%. Hence,  the  challenge  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage   SMEs  to  intensify  their  workers'   retraining\r\n\r\nefforts.  For these companies, tax incentive is not the  most\r\n\r\nappropriate remedy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Leong Horn Kee\r\n\r\nhave  suggested  tax  relief or co-payment  grants  to  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean or family to enroll in an IT course or to  buy  a\r\n\r\ncomputer.  The  Government is well  aware  that  as  we  move\r\n\r\ntowards a knowledge-based economy and an information society,\r\n\r\nthe  risks of fault-lines developing between the IT-savvy and\r\n\r\nthe  non-IT  savvy  will increase. It is  important  that  IT\r\n\r\ncourses and PCs be made accessible to all Singaporeans.  This\r\n\r\nis not a problem for the young, who are getting such exposure\r\n\r\nand access in schools and tertiary institutions. What we need\r\n\r\nis  to  address the needs of those who are not schooling  and\r\n\r\nwho  have  no access to PCs because they cannot afford  them.\r\n\r\nFor  these  people, the suggestion of tax  relief  or  a  co-payment scheme will not be the best solution. After all,  65%\r\n\r\nof  taxpayers  base  currently do not pay taxes.  A  targeted\r\n\r\neffort  will  be  more effective in helping Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nreally need such assistance. IDA is setting aside $25 million\r\n\r\nover  the  next  3  years to work with self-help  groups  and\r\n\r\ngrassroots organisations to offer used PCs bundled with  free\r\n\r\nInternet  access and basic training to some 30,000 low-income\r\n\r\nhouseholds.  Free broadband access will be made available  at\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and clubs. Government also  has  in  place\r\n\r\nvarious schemes to provide affordable IT training or to  help\r\n\r\ndefray part of the cost of IT courses. These include the  ONE\r\n\r\nLearning  Place,  the  IT  Coach, the  Critical  IT  Resource\r\n\r\nProgramme,  the  Skills  Development  Fund  and  the   Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing SMEs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Kenneth Chen, Mr Gerard Ee and Mr\r\n\r\nNoris Ong have asked\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  more  assistance, such as tax concessions, for  SMEs  to\r\n\r\nparticipate  in the knowledge-based economy. I  should  point\r\n\r\nout there are limitations in using the tax route to help SMEs\r\n\r\ndevelop.   This is because SMEs do not pay much  tax  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst  place.   Based on 1998 tax collection, companies  with\r\n\r\nassessed income of $100,000 or below accounted for only  1.7%\r\n\r\nof  the  net  corporate  tax  assessed.  The  Government  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  chosen to assist SMEs comprehensively via  grants,\r\n\r\nloans and technical assistance schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Productivity and Standards Board released last year\r\n\r\na  10-year  strategic plan, SME21. Specifically,  SME21  will\r\n\r\ngroom  innovative  high-growth SMEs so  that,  over  time,  a\r\n\r\nsteady  stream of SMEs can reach world-class status. The  aim\r\n\r\nis  to treble the number of local SMEs with sales turnover of\r\n\r\n$10  million  and above, from 2,000 to 6,000  by  year  2010.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  SME21  aims  to upgrade the  low-productivity  SME\r\n\r\nsectors,  such  as  the  retail and  other  domestic  service\r\n\r\nsectors. Thirdly, SME21 aims to create a knowledge-based, pro-enterprise environment. For instance, e-commerce, if embraced\r\n\r\nand  harnessed  by SMEs, will open up vast opportunities  and\r\n\r\nremove the traditional barriers to SME growth.  The aim is to\r\n\r\nquadruple  the  number  of SMEs with e-commerce  transactions\r\n\r\nfrom 8,000 to 32,000 by the year 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are further schemes which can help SMEs enhance\r\n\r\ntheir  competitiveness, the Ministry of Finance will be  open\r\n\r\nto  considering  them.  We will continue  to  create  a  pro-business environment for SMEs, and integrate them in  overall\r\n\r\neconomic development strategies. But, SMEs must want to  help\r\n\r\nand upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax treatment of foreign-sourced income</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has asked for tax incentives to lure back\r\n\r\nto  Singapore interest income on the funds parked  abroad  by\r\n\r\nhigh  net  worth Singaporeans. Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore,\r\n\r\ntax  is  imposed  on a territorial basis. In  practice,  this\r\n\r\nmeans that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincome  arising from sources within Singapore will be subject\r\n\r\nto  tax.  Income arising from sources outside Singapore  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  taxed  in Singapore, unless it is remitted  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore. In contrast, a number of developed countries apply\r\n\r\nthe worldwide basis of taxation, taxing both the domestic and\r\n\r\nforeign sources of income of its residents as income arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not in favour of exempting or taxing foreign\r\n\r\nincome  remittance at a lower rate while domestic  income  is\r\n\r\ntaxed  in  full.  Doing  so will only  create  loopholes  for\r\n\r\nresidents  to  channel Singapore income offshore  to  low-tax\r\n\r\ncountries or to tax havens, and to remit it later  at  a  tax\r\n\r\nadvantage.   Singapore  will risk being  regarded  as  a  tax\r\n\r\nhaven,  with  the result that our foreign investors  will  be\r\n\r\npenalised  with  anti-tax avoidance measures.  In  any  case,\r\n\r\nSingapore  enjoys  a  comprehensive  network  of  double  tax\r\n\r\ntreaties  and also provides generous unilateral  tax  credit.\r\n\r\nCoupled  with our low corporate tax rate of 26%,  this  means\r\n\r\nthat  most  foreign income that had suffered taxes  elsewhere\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  to  suffer additional tax when  remitted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also currently already tax incentive schemes\r\n\r\navailable, such as the Operational Headquarters Incentive and\r\n\r\nthe Overseas Enterprise Incentive which provide for exemption\r\n\r\nfor certain types of foreign source income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Group relief</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong and Mr Leong Horn Kee have suggested\r\n\r\nallowing  group offsetting of losses to help  ease  the  cash\r\n\r\nflow  of  companies undertaking new ventures which are  loss-making. There were also suggestions that we allow the  losses\r\n\r\nof  foreign subsidiaries to be offset against the profits  of\r\n\r\nthe parent company in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A company sets up a subsidiary as a separate legal\r\n\r\nentity to carry out a particular activity because it wants to\r\n\r\nlimit   its  liabilities  and  exposure  arising  from   that\r\n\r\nactivity.  Since a subsidiary is a separate entity which  can\r\n\r\nsue  or  be  sued  in its own right, there is no  fundamental\r\n\r\nreason to treat it differently for tax\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npurposes.   Thus  it is logically taxed separately  from  its\r\n\r\nparent company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allowing group relief represents a fundamental change to\r\n\r\nour  corporate  tax  regime and can have significant  revenue\r\n\r\nimplications.  If  group  relief  were  allowed,   profitable\r\n\r\ncompanies within a group may end up not having to pay tax  on\r\n\r\ntheir  profits  if losses incurred by other companies  within\r\n\r\nthe  group were included. This may open up opportunities  for\r\n\r\ntax  planning.   It will raise the cost of tax administration\r\n\r\nbecause complex tax rules will need to be drawn up to prevent\r\n\r\nabuse,  and  has invariably been the experience of  countries\r\n\r\nwhich allow group relief.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point which Members may not be aware of is that\r\n\r\ncurrently,   we   allow   losses  to   be   carried   forward\r\n\r\nindefinitely.  Hence, as long as a company can  turn  around,\r\n\r\nthe  earlier  losses can be used to offset tax on  the  later\r\n\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for foreign losses incurred by our companies setting\r\n\r\nup  operations  abroad, just as their foreign income  is  not\r\n\r\ntaxed  unless remitted to Singapore, likewise, their  foreign\r\n\r\nlosses  should  not  be allowed for offset  against  domestic\r\n\r\nincome. Otherwise, Government will end up subsidising foreign\r\n\r\nventures  from  domestic tax revenue. As  a  concession,  the\r\n\r\nOverseas Investment Incentive allows capital losses from  the\r\n\r\nsale  of  shares  in,  or liquidation of,  approved  overseas\r\n\r\ninvestments  to  be set off against the company's  Singapore-sourced income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House may also wish to note that\r\n\r\ngenerally  for  countries which have group  relief,  overseas\r\n\r\ncompanies in the group are in fact excluded. Losses  incurred\r\n\r\nby such companies cannot be consolidated for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Employee stock options</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, including Mr Chew Heng Ching, Mr Iswaran, Mr\r\n\r\nAhmad  Magad and Mr Peh Chin Hua, have spoken on facilitating\r\n\r\nemployee  stock options (ESOPs).  Assoc. Prof. Low Seow  Chay\r\n\r\nhas  also  said that it is not correct to subject gains  from\r\n\r\nESOP  to  tax. ESOP is a form of remuneration and gains  made\r\n\r\nfrom exercising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nESOP are hence a form of employment benefit that ought to  be\r\n\r\nliable for tax.  Nonetheless, as I have announced during  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Speech, an incentivised tax treatment  of  ESOPs  for\r\n\r\nhigh-tech start-ups will be announced at the end of May  this\r\n\r\nyear.   The  intention  is  to take  Members'  comments  into\r\n\r\naccount  in working out the scheme and we will be looking  at\r\n\r\nfeedback from the industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Supplementary Retirement Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Members like Dr Wang Kai Yuen, Mr\r\n\r\nChew Heng Ching, Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Noris Ong for their\r\n\r\nvarious   suggestions  in  relation  to   the   Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme (SRS). I mentioned in my Budget Speech that\r\n\r\nthe  details  of the SRS will take time to work out,  and  we\r\n\r\nhope  to  implement the scheme by next year.  There  will  be\r\n\r\nextensive  consultation  with  the  private  sector  on   the\r\n\r\nimplementation details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Preparing for Ageing</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members, including Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay,\r\n\r\nMr  Yeo  Guat  Kwang,  and Mr Harun  Ghani,  have  spoken  on\r\n\r\npreparing for an ageing society.  Government has endorsed  in\r\n\r\nprinciple   the   recommendations  of  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Ageing.   Ministry  of  Finance  is  currently\r\n\r\nworking with the IMC Secretariat and implementing agencies on\r\n\r\nthe required budget based on cost effectiveness and financial\r\n\r\nsustainability of the recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Encouraging Families, Marriage and Procreation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee, Mr Harun Ghani, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang have called on the Government to do  more  for\r\n\r\nthe  family  and  youths.  Mr Speaker, Sir, Government  views\r\n\r\nfamily  as a crucial institution in our society.  One of  the\r\n\r\nfive key ideas of the Singapore 21 Vision is \"Strong families\r\n\r\n- our Foundation and our Future\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help promote and strengthen the family as an\r\n\r\ninstitution,  as well as to fulfill the needs of  the  youths\r\n\r\nand the elderly, the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Sports  will get a substantial increase of  38%  in  its\r\n\r\nFiscal  Year  2000  budget.  Despite  this,  Mdm  Chiang  has\r\n\r\ncommented that Government has not committed enough for  youth\r\n\r\ninterests  and  dysfunctional families.   These  are  complex\r\n\r\nissues  that  have to be addressed through the efforts  of  a\r\n\r\nvariety of agencies, not all of which fall within the purview\r\n\r\nof  MCDS.  The budget for MCDS should therefore not be viewed\r\n\r\nin  isolation.  For example, tackling the issues  of  teenage\r\n\r\ndelinquency is not the responsibility of MCDS alone.  MOE and\r\n\r\nMHA  both  have substantial involvement on the preventive  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  rehabilitative aspects.  Government's  spending  on\r\n\r\nsocial  and community development should be looked  at  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   This  sector  has consistently  been  allocated  the\r\n\r\nlargest share of the Government's expenditure budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>HDB Upgrading</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked whether MOF will make available\r\n\r\nmore money for town councils and CDCs to improve connectivity\r\n\r\nwithin  a  community.  Dr Teo and Dr Wang Kai Yuen have  also\r\n\r\nasked  for  more  funds  for the Main and  Interim  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes  (MUP  and IUP) this year.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in\r\n\r\nFiscal  Year  2000,  provision for the Community  Improvement\r\n\r\nProjects   Committee  to  improve  accessibility   within   a\r\n\r\ncommunity  is $45 million, an increase of 25% over FY99.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment has not cut back on the total budget allocated for\r\n\r\nthe MUP and IUP programmes, and has no intention of doing so.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of National Development has been given a  total\r\n\r\nbudget  of  $5.5  billion to carry out  the  programmes.   As\r\n\r\nconstruction  costs  have come down significantly,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat  more can now be undertaken with the same total  budget.\r\n\r\nThe  question  of how best to structure the budget  allocated\r\n\r\nfor  the MUP and IUP programmes, and the pace at which  these\r\n\r\nprogrammes are to be carried out is left to MND to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Improving the Civil Service</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua, Mr Inderjit Singh and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua\r\n\r\nhave spoken on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed to improve our civil service.  This is a fair call.  Our\r\n\r\ncivil service must continually strive to be among the best in\r\n\r\nthe  world.   But we must be mindful that Government  is  not\r\n\r\nlike  businesses and cannot be motivated or driven solely  by\r\n\r\nprofit  and  loss.   A  lot  of  the  Government's  work   is\r\n\r\nmonopolistic and is about creating social value, which cannot\r\n\r\nbe easily measured against commercial benchmarks.  The impact\r\n\r\nof what Government does is mostly non-economic in nature.   I\r\n\r\nwould be most concerned if individual civil servants are paid\r\n\r\naccording to their financial achievement on their job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have adopted the paradigm of requiring the Ministries\r\n\r\nto get the most out of their allocated budgets, and to strive\r\n\r\nfor    organisational   excellence   and   for    sustainable\r\n\r\nperformance.   From this year, the desired  outcomes  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistries are being published in the Budget book.  Over  the\r\n\r\nnext  couple  of years, various resource management  concepts\r\n\r\nand  practices  will be introduced for Ministries  to  better\r\n\r\nmanage  their  resources to achieve even  greater  value  for\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for organisational excellence, every Ministry and\r\n\r\ndepartment is looking at achieving ISO9000 certification, the\r\n\r\nPeople  Developer  Award  and  the  Singapore  Quality  Class\r\n\r\nleading  on, hopefully, to the Singapore Quality  Award.   At\r\n\r\nthe end of the day, performance of Government is really about\r\n\r\nhow  well  we are able to achieve the outcomes in areas  like\r\n\r\ninternational competitiveness, universal education,  economic\r\n\r\nproductivity, high standards of living, political and  social\r\n\r\nstability, and national security.  While there are  often  no\r\n\r\ndirect  measures  for  these, there  are  many  international\r\n\r\nrankings, comparisons and assessments made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua is right in saying that further\r\n\r\nprivatisation may be inevitable.  Indeed, Government believes\r\n\r\nthat  all Government operations that can have bottomline  and\r\n\r\nwhich   provide  services  that  are  measurable   could   be\r\n\r\ncorporatised, or at least converted to a statutory board.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  Government has just last year corporatised the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks Department.  However, we must recognise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  end,  there will remain a core  of  Government\r\n\r\nrelating  to core regulatory functions and policy formulation\r\n\r\nwhich cannot be corporatised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as my speech demonstrates, we need all\r\n\r\nthree sectors - the public, private and people sectors  -  to\r\n\r\nbe vigorous, robust and enterprising for Singapore to survive\r\n\r\nand  succeed  in  this  new  age of  global  competition  and\r\n\r\naccelerated change.  We must constantly be willing to try out\r\n\r\nnew  ideas, nimble in exploiting new opportunities and  quick\r\n\r\nin  responding to changing demands.  At the same time we must\r\n\r\nnot  forget certain fundamentals.  We have to live within our\r\n\r\nmeans  -  no  one  owes us our existence or  a  living.   Our\r\n\r\nfamilies  are  important and are the backbone of  our  social\r\n\r\nfabric.   We must adhere to meritocracy to allow the  talents\r\n\r\nof  our  people to be developed and harnessed  the  best  way\r\n\r\npossible.  We have to continually look forward and invest  in\r\n\r\nour future prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, together, the people and the Government\r\n\r\ncan  make  tomorrow  a  better one for Singapore  if  we  are\r\n\r\npragmatic  in  our approach and yet bold in our  dreams.   In\r\n\r\nthis  light,  this  year's Budget after the  economic  crisis\r\n\r\nrepresents  an  important milestone to meet the  demands  and\r\n\r\nchallenges of the new economy.  It is a budget in transition.\r\n\r\nIf  we change too slowly, we end up with the world passing us\r\n\r\nby.   If we change too fast, we may end up going on the wrong\r\n\r\npath.   We need wisdom, courage and a capacity for trial  and\r\n\r\nerror.   I thank Members for all their contributions in  this\r\n\r\nprocess.  [Applause].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to\r\n\r\nseek clarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Thank you, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First clarification, Sir. Is it not true that there are\r\n\r\nmany  workers, especially those who are working in  companies\r\n\r\nwhich have not recovered, who continue to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndraw  a much lower salary compared to pre-crisis level?   And\r\n\r\nyet  is it morally right for the Government to restore  civil\r\n\r\nservice and Ministers' salary up to that level?  I understand\r\n\r\njust  now  that  for the Ministers, it does not  seem  to  be\r\n\r\nsufficient.  It is going to increase further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is it not true that while many Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsuffer,  and some are still suffering because of the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn,  the Government turns out to be the biggest  winner\r\n\r\nin the economic downturn, with its coffers overflowing?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third clarification, Sir. The Minister says that the\r\n\r\nBudget  was prepared early January 1999, and he did not  know\r\n\r\nthere  would  be  a  recovery,  and  thereby  there  is  over\r\n\r\nprovision  on the development expenditure.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nknow  when did the Government come to know that it  does  not\r\n\r\nneed to spend the development expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would like to know from the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe  foresees  any  possible asset inflation as  had  happened\r\n\r\nbefore, just before the financial crisis hit us, and which  I\r\n\r\nthink  resulted in quite a lot of stress and pressure on  the\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not say\r\n\r\nthat the civil service wages have been fully restored.  I did\r\n\r\npoint  out  that it was not fully restored.  And I  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  sectors  in  the  population  who  must  be\r\n\r\nreceiving less pay than they had before the recession.   That\r\n\r\nis something which is a fact of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question was in this whole exercise, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  ended  up  as the biggest  winner.   Who  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  The money in the reserves is yours.  What is the\r\n\r\nGovernment?   The  Government  represents  the  people.   The\r\n\r\nFrontbench and the Ministers are just your agents holding the\r\n\r\nmoney safely so that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Distribute the money!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Distribute the money, that is\r\n\r\nquite a different thing altogether.  I think you can do  that\r\n\r\nwhen you take over the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question was on development expenditure. As I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  my response earlier on, a provision  was  made\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be used in case 1999 turned out to  be  a  poor\r\n\r\nyear.   Maybe  the  year as a whole would be  a  recessionary\r\n\r\nyear.   So  some of the money was set aside to  be  put  into\r\n\r\ncivil  works, like they did in Japan, in case you  needed  to\r\n\r\ncreate  jobs  if  the situation got worse.  But  the  economy\r\n\r\nrecovered from the second quarter onwards.  Second, third and\r\n\r\nfourth  quarter growth rates were all very rapid.  It is  the\r\n\r\nswing from the first quarter, which was still very weak, to a\r\n\r\nrapid improvement in the second, third and fourth quarters  - which  allowed  us  to  see that a  lot  of  the  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure provisions would not be necessary.  And I did say\r\n\r\nthat unless they are essential expenditures, we prefer not to\r\n\r\nspend them, if you do not need them to create new jobs.   You\r\n\r\nwill  notice  that in Japan, trillions of Yen have  been  put\r\n\r\ninto  public  works to no effect in order  to  stimulate  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  I also mentioned earlier that the structure of  our\r\n\r\neconomy  is basically export dependent.  Stimulating domestic\r\n\r\neconomy  through  fiscal pump-priming does not  produce  very\r\n\r\ngood results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member's question on whether asset inflation\r\n\r\nis  a  problem.  It is indeed a problem.  But the high  asset\r\n\r\ninflation  has  not taken place here but in other  countries,\r\n\r\nalthough  we  have seen some of it flowing through  into  our\r\n\r\neconomy.  But I do not think we have reached the point  where\r\n\r\nwe need to be overly concerned.  My main worry is whether the\r\n\r\nUS  stock  markets  will continue to hold  for  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nlength  of  time  and do not retreat to the  point  where  it\r\n\r\naffects  US  domestic demand, and therefore  impacts  on  our\r\n\r\nexports.   For  the time being, asset inflation is  something\r\n\r\nwhich we keep an eye on.  But I do not think in Singapore, it\r\n\r\nhas reached a point\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere drastic action needs to be taken like, for example,  we\r\n\r\ndid in 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I have your\r\n\r\npermission  to seek further clarification.  When I questioned\r\n\r\nthe  deficit budgetary position of the Government at the last\r\n\r\nbudget debate, I pointed out that we might not end up with  a\r\n\r\ndeficit  if development expenditure was not that  much.   The\r\n\r\nMinister knew then that there was a provision which might  or\r\n\r\nmight not be needed.  Is it true?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Yes. When you expect a\r\n\r\nrecession,  you make a provision to spend money  to  try  and\r\n\r\nmitigate the effects of the recession.  This was provided for\r\n\r\nin  the  FY1999  budget.  We had quite a large provision  for\r\n\r\nadditional development expenditure which we thought might  be\r\n\r\nneeded  in case, instead of a recovery, the economy continued\r\n\r\nto  slide  from a low first quarter into the remaining  three\r\n\r\nquarters of last year.  But events turned out that we did not\r\n\r\nneed it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> In other words, my suspicion, at\r\n\r\nthe  last year's Budget debate, that we might not really have\r\n\r\na deficit budget is true.  It is correct.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I do not know what he means.
