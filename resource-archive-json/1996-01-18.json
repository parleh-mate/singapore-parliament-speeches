Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for Health to specify some of the improvements in delivery of health care since the restructuring of hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, restructuring has brought about many improvements in the delivery of health care service in public hospitals. Some of these improvements include more patient oriented services, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> better communication with patients, improvements in patient waiting times, new clinical services and improvements to infrastructure. I would describe a little the improvements in each of these areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(i) More Patient Oriented Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One significant area of improvement is in the reorganisation and simplification of operational systems, procedures and work flow which have made hospital services more convenient to patients and more responsive to their medical needs. For patients who require admission, a one-stop admission service at ward level has been introduced at Toa Payoh Hospital (TPH) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH). At the outpatient level, specialist outpatient clinics have been reorganised into multi-disciplinary one-stop clinics, eg, Urology Centre, Brain Centre, Heart Centre and Diabetes Centre at SGH; Arthritis Clinic at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and Oncology Centre at Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(ii) Better Communication with Patients</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through an extensive service improvement programme, all hospital frontline staff and supervisors have been trained to be more caring and courteous in their dealings with the public. There has been significant improvement in the way doctors, nurses and counter clerks relate to the patients, their relatives and the public. Financial counselling is routinely provided to all patients and their relatives before admission. Information booklets on hospital services and certain treatment procedures have been made available to patients. This has helped to allay the anxiety of patients before admission or surgery. iii) Improvements in Patient Waiting Times \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a general improvement in waiting times for appointments for surgery and specialist outpatient clinic consultation and waiting times to see the doctor at the specialist outpatient clinics and at the pharmacies to collect medicines. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(iv) New Clinical Services</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New clinical services have been introduced in the hospitals' departments since restructuring. These include Medical Oncology, Neurosurgery and Neurology in SGH, Ear, Nose and Throat and Eye services in TPH, genetic counselling and menopause clinics in KKH, and Podiatry service in TTSH. SGH and TTSH also have walk- in clinics to treat non-emergency patients who would normally have been attended to at the Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) Department. This has allowed the doctors at the A&amp;E Departments to spend more time on the emergency patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>(v) Improvements to Infrastructure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the opening of ambulatory surgery centres in the hospitals, more patients can now undergo surgery as day patients, thus reducing their hospital cost. New technology such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computerised Tomography (CT) scans have been introduced. The operating theatre and intensive care facilities have been upgraded. Physical improvements have been made to the wards and specialist outpatient clinics in all hospitals so that patients can now enjoy a better ambience and greater comfort as an inpatient or as an outpatient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these improvements have led to a high level of patient satisfaction. In general, more than 90% of feedback from patients have rated the hospital care as good or excellent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, I want to ask the Senior Minister of State for Health two questions. First, in response to these changes, has the waiting time for medical care improved significantly? Second, has a review been undertaken regarding the access to medical care for the lower income group? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As I informed the Member in my general reply, there has been improvement in waiting time. But for specific information on the waiting time by the kind of service, I would appreciate it if he could file a Question and we will give him the detailed breakdown. But \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> generally, between 1990 and 1995, all the hospitals have seen an improvement in waiting times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of access to health care services for the poor, they have always had access to our public sector hospitals. As the Member is well aware, we subsidize B2 and C wards heavily. We have also introduced a new class of ward, B2+, in some hospitals and they are subsidized at 50%. Medifund has been introduced and the number of applicants has actually gone up and the proportion of cases which have been given financial assistance is still very high. I think some 99.6% have been given assistance. So restructuring does not and has not meant a decline in access to good health care at the public sector hospitals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Sir, have there been any cases which have been denied health care because they are unable to find the funds to get the medical care required? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> I am not aware of any cases, but if the Member has any case to report, I would be pleased to look into it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, would the Minister please tell us why there have been so many changes in the manner of paying fees to doctors and how have these differing schemes impacted on the quality of medical care? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a consultancy fee scheme for doctors in the restructured hospitals. The idea was to encourage doctors to improve the quality of service to patients. After a couple of years, we found there were some weaknesses in the system and therefore some changes had been implemented to correct the weaknesses. One of the changes was to introduce the point system in remunerating doctors, so that the doctors earned points irrespective of whether they serviced private patients or subsidized patients. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent feedback is that some doctors find this system not satisfactory either, because they feel that they are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> being timed and weighted for every single bit of work they do and they feel that their professionalism has been hindered. Now the hospitals are looking into reforming this system again. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member, I must say that these changes have been found necessary. If she thinks that there have been too many revisions within a period of a few years, the people on the ground feel that some more changes are necessary because there are weaknesses in the existing system. But whatever system it is, there is always a certain degree of imperfection that we may have to live with. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Would the Minister please confirm that self-referrals, where the patients refer themselves to various specialists instead of being referred by another doctor, are available and how widely are they used? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, at the outpatient specialist clinics at the restructured hospitals, it is possible for patients to \"walk in\" to see a doctor, ie, they can make appointments by themselves to see a doctor. But generally, the bulk of the patients in the restructured hospitals come from referrals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that these self-referrals by patients could lead to unnecessary consumption of medical services and sometimes wrong referrals? So would the Minister consider doing away with self-referrals to consultants and only allowing referrals by other doctors so that there is no unnecessary wastage of medical services? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> As I said, the proportion of self-referrals is very small. If we were to do away with it, ie, by requiring all patients to have a referral before they can see a specialist in a restructured hospital, then we require altogether a very different system from what we have. We have to think about this proposal carefully and whether this constitutes another form of wastage of resources for the nation. To cut down costs, the patients themselves also have to be educated. They should not just go and see a specialist for a small thing. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> But may I suggest to the Member that this question is not really related to the main Question asked by Dr Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>HDB SALES TRANSACTIONS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Handling by HDB appointed agents and private individuals)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. \n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan</b> asked the Minister for National Development (a) the rationale for allowing the Housing and Development Board sales transactions handled by appointed agents to be completed in 4 weeks while allowing those transacted by private individuals to take seven weeks and (b) what measures are in place to deal with those appointed agents who misrepresent to the Housing and Development Board on the purchase prices. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB's target for resale transactions by private individuals is five weeks. In other words, private individual applicants will be given their first appointment about five weeks after the submission of their applications, provided they submit all relevant documents and valuation report together with the application form, as in the case of applications submitted by the listed agents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such transactions require one week more than the four-week target for the listed housing agents because HDB will need to do additional checks to ensure that all the documents and valuation reports are in order. In the case of the listed agents, HDB expects these agents to do all these checks before submission to HDB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of the Question, listed housing agencies who are found to have misrepresented the resale prices will be: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) prosecuted under the Penal Code for making a false statutory declaration. The penalty is an unlimited fine and a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii) debarred from handling resale transactions for a one-year period; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii) dropped from the list. HDB will also publicise the delisting of the agency in the mass media. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, it was reported in the papers last month that the private individual transactions will actually take seven weeks. I am happy to hear now that the target is five weeks. But I really want to understand why there is still a one-week difference. Are we trying to encourage people to go to an agent? A 1% fee for an agent for a flat, say, in Bishan, which is now $770,000, is $7,700. So it is quite significant. Why can we not make it four weeks for private individuals who submit all their documents on time just as in the case of agents? Why do we not make it the same for both cases? Also, can we not make the punishment for private individuals the same as that for the agents? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I explained in my answer, there is additional processing time required by HDB. The agents do provide a certain level of service and because of this additional processing time individuals will require five weeks whereas the listed agents require four weeks. One week does not make that big a difference. In fact, HDB encourages individuals to do the resale transactions on their own. HDB has been running seminars on Saturday afternoons and they intend to run seminars now on every first Saturday of the month. So individuals who are planning to buy or sell resale flats can book into one of these seminars. HDB will explain the procedures clearly and what is required, and they are welcome to do the transactions themselves. But those who want to engage housing agents must be prepared to pay the commission and we hope the housing agents will provide the level of service expected in earning that commission. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> I agree that one week is not too much of a difference. But I want to make the point that HDB should deal with private individuals as well as agents on equal terms. Let us try and target for four weeks. Secondly, we should publicise what the Minister has said. HDB must publicise more of this to the public \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> so that they are aware because right now they think that their transactions take seven weeks while it is four weeks for the agents and that the HDB is really trying to encourage them to use the services of the agents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is why we appreciate the Member raising this question here for us to clarify the situation and to explain that HDB does run these seminars. These seminars will also in time be conducted in Mandarin so that the ordinary persons can do these transactions on their own. But if they want to hire an agent, the agent does provide a service by linking a willing buyer and willing seller. We hope the agents would provide that level of service as required. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> How about my question to allow 4 weeks as well for private individuals? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained, there is extra work to be done by HDB when an individual submits an application. Some portion of the work is done by the agent. If an individual does it, he is not doing that segment of the work. So that part is done by HDB, and HDB takes an extra one week. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SIMEX</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Protection against future crises)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc.

They include Dr Wayne Angell, a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Mr John Gilmore, a former Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, Mr Michael Jenkins, the Chairman of the London Commodity Exchange, Mr Leo Melamed, the former Chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Mr Jack Sandner, its current Chairman. They were appointed to advise on best practices in the futures industry worldwide that could be adopted to improve SIMEX's operations and systems and to enhance customer protection. The Panel concluded its study in October 1995 and made the following recommendations to SIMEX: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To establish rules and evaluate those in place regarding customer protection with respect to proper margining of positions, segregation and trading floor practices; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To upgrade SIMEX clearing policies, systems and procedures to incorporate real-time clearing and settlement and critical risk management systems; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To establish confidential information sharing arrangements with mutual offset partners and other exchanges; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) To establish a requirement for clearing members that a senior officer, who must be in a position of full authority for all business of the firm at SIMEX and related activities on other exchanges, be registered with the Exchange; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) To enhance SIMEX's Market Surveillance Department which is charged with responsibilities including monitoring market positions and their potential impact; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) To establish a comprehensive large trader reporting system which will enable the Exchange to determine the ultimate owner of large positions on SIMEX including those maintained in omnibus accounts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1995, SIMEX also appointed a consultant, Dr Roger Rutz, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Board of Trading Clearing Corporation, one of the world's largest clearing houses. He was asked to review SIMEX's clearing and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> settlement operations and its system for market surveillance so as to improve its clearing and risk management functions. The key measures recommended by the consultant included: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Establishing a Risk Management Committee to oversee policies on capital requirements, financial and segregation requirements, position limits and reporting and clearing house systems; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Improving internal risk analysis procedures to identify accounts and members carrying large positions which may result in substantial losses, and perform tests on these accounts to determine the potential risk to both members and large account holders; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Performing detailed analysis of settlements and margin calls on clearing members on a daily basis; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Monitoring closely positions carried by clearing members and large accounts which constitute a high percentage of the positions in the market; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) Upgrading computer systems to provide real-time, on-demand information for clearing processing and risk management. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIMEX has adopted all the recommendations made by the Panel and its consultant. It has already implemented the majority of these recommendations and is in the process of implementing the balance, which involve software modifications or rule changes. In line with the recommendations, a new Regulatory and Risk Management Division within SIMEX has been created, comprising the Audit, Floor Compliance, Market Surveillance and Clearing House Departments. Staffing for the division has been strengthened from 48 to 68 members currently, and an eventual total of 78. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps being taken by SIMEX should enable it to monitor its risk exposure to large accounts and take the necessary action to contain these risks. This would minimise systemic risk arising from the failure of a firm having knock-on effects on other participants in the market. However, it should be emphasized that no \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> regulatory system, however comprehensive, can guarantee that a firm will not fail as a result of fraud or excessive speculative trading. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc.

However, Article 15(4) says that, \"This Article does not authorise any act contrary to any general law relating to public order, public health or morality\".

However, this programme that is being studied is, by no means, equivalent to the upgrading programme that we are carrying out for HDB flats. What the committee is doing is to see whether all the current improvement works on the roads, planting on the verges, lighting, neighbourhood parks, etc, can be better coordinated so as to achieve a better result. In doing so, there may also be scope for further improvements. The main thrust of the programme being considered for private housing estates is therefore to see what can be done to the common areas outside the individual homes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for private apartments, the upgrading will be carried out outside the apartment blocks. Apartment developments which can form part of a cluster with a housing estate will be included in the upgrading of that housing estate. The difficulty is that many private apartment blocks are stand-alone developments which do not form part of a cluster within a housing estate. Such cases will have a much more limited scope for upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must, however, stress that the Government's priority remains with the upgrading of the older smaller HDB flats. One of the objectives of upgrading HDB \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> flats, besides improving the environment, is to enhance the value of these flats. As the value of private property has appreciated significantly over the past few years, we will continue to place our efforts and emphasis in the HDB estates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Imram bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Imram bin Mohamed (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, has any money actually been disbursed to private estates for the purpose of upgrading their common areas? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Currently, there are on-going programmes to upgrade and improve the private housing estates done by the various agencies in different Ministries, whether it is Parks and Recreation Department in planting, landscaping, improving the neighbourhood parks, or the Roads Branch in improving the roads, or the Ministry of the Environment (Drainage Department) in improving the drains. So money has and is spent all the time on the private housing estates. What this committee tries to do is to see how these can be integrated and, in so doing, add other items to the upgrading programme. The committee has not completed its deliberations yet because this is an inter-Ministry committee.

Anyone can offer such services if they apply for a licence and accept the licensing conditions. The key licensing conditions imposed by TAS are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The service provider should assume sole responsibility for all information content and seek clearance from the relevant authorities; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Call charges should be clearly made known to the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS does not regulate the pricing of Audiotex service because it is not a basic telecommunication service. The fee is set by the service providers based on the anticipated demand for their services. It is not possible for TAS to determine a fair market price for these services in view of their diversity and variety. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of the question raised by the Member, my answer is that Singapore Telecom operates a Phone Plus feature known as \"Phone Lock\" which allows subscribers to bar unauthorised outgoing calls, including calls to Audiotex services. Phone Plus is an optional feature. There is a charge for this optional service. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen:</b> Could the Minister consider providing a free security code for subscribers because I think it is not reasonable to charge them? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Chee Wee:</b> As I have explained, there is the Phone Lock service provided by Singapore Telecom.

Besides the age of the flats, the criteria for selecting the precincts for each batch depend also on other factors, such as the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> geographical spread of the flats, the level of support for the programme as well as the cleanliness of the precinct. HDB will continue to adjust and fine-tune its schedule so that precincts deserving upgrading more are given priority. The selected precincts will be announced progressively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that the Main Upgrading Programme which has an impact on Singaporeans and where large amounts of Government fund have been spent should be made more transparent? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Main Upgrading Programme is very transparent. First of all, in announcing the programme we said that this is a 15 to 20-year programme to upgrade all HDB flats which are more than 17 years old. These constitute 370,000 flats. We intend to upgrade something like 15,000 to 20,000 flats every year and we have to identify these flats batch by batch. When each batch is announced, the criteria are explained. People will vote on it. The funds are provided for in Parliament. We have debated on it every Budget year. I do not see how transparent you can get. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, since the Minister has said that there are specific principles in selecting these flats, for instance, they must meet certain criteria, like age of the flat and the cleanliness of the precinct, can the Ministry not base on these basic criteria to come out with a schedule? I understand from the Annual Report that HDB is going to upgrading 15 precincts a year. So it could base on this number and give an estimated date of all the flats which qualify under the Main Upgrading Programme. I do not think it is that difficult. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained in my answer, one of the criteria is age. So if a flat is more than 20 years old, the chances of it being upgraded in the next few years are very good. However, there are also other considerations in choosing flats which are more than 20 years old. We want to make sure that they are all geographically spread out. We want to make sure that there is a high level of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> support and we want to make sure that the residents do take care of their precincts in the level of cleanliness. So we have got to check on these precincts and we will decide on the precincts batch by batch and year by year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, is it not possible for the Ministry to base on certain criteria, for instance, as the Minister has said, the age of the flat, and give a schedule of the estimated date for all the flats and, if subsequently there is any change, since it is only an estimate, it could explain why it was changed or delayed to a later stage? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The current estimate is very good. If a flat is above 25 years, the chances are very good. If it is above 20 years, the chances are not so good. In the next few years, if it is below 20 years, there is no chance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that it is not a matter of whether the chances are good or not? It would be better for the public to at least know there is an estimated schedule to show what can be expected from the upgrading programme for the next, say, 15 to 20 years because, eventually, all the flats should be upgraded. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Without having to belabour this point, I think the first criterion which most Singaporeans would know is the age of their flat. So knowing the age of their own flat, they know when would be the approximate time of their upgrading. If you are living in a very old flat in Queensway, the chances of your flat being upgraded would be higher than if you are living in a flat in Bedok or Hougang. Second, there are other criteria. We do not want to just upgrade all the flats in Queensway because they are more than 30 years old. We want to make sure that the benefits of upgrading are spread out geographically in Singapore. If we go strictly, mechanically, robotically and automatically by age, then upgrading will just be concentrated in the older estates, like Queensway and Toa Payoh. So we want to have a geographical spread. Each \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> time when we announce the batch, we make sure that Singaporeans living in all sectors of Singapore do benefit from the upgrading programme which is also ranked by the age of the flats in that sector or area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, of course, we want to know whether there is support for the programme. There is no point in announcing and identifying a precinct for upgrading, go through one year of design and only to receive less than 75% endorsement of the programme. It is a waste of the residents' time. It is a waste of the architects' time. So we want to know whether there is support for the programme before we announce or identify the batch. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at January this year, we have decided to also include cleanliness as a criterion. By including cleanliness, we have a mechanism where the level of cleanliness of the precincts is shortlisted and monitored. So those residents who keep their precincts clean would be slotted for upgrading ahead of those who persistently dirty their precincts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that as more criteria are added which are variable, like cleanliness, the residents who live in flats which are more than 20 years old would be uncertain about the chances of their flats being upgraded? Why is it not possible for the Ministry to base on certain specific principles which are already established and leave the variable factors aside, and come out with at least an estimated schedule, so that the residents can expect when their flats would be upgraded? Of course, subject to other variables, you may add two years, or if there are many graffiti or the crime rate in the precinct is high, then your precinct would not be upgraded. But at least the basic criterion is the age of the flat. The other factor which I think --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, are you making a speech? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Does the Minister agree that looking at the selection of past and recent precincts, it seems that Toa Payoh Estate has been given quite a lot of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> upgrading programmes compared to older estates like Queenstown or Tiong Bahru for that matter? This raises the question as to how these blocks are being selected for upgrading. I think certain criteria like geographical spread have not been properly explained in the announcement on the selection of the precincts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, there is a method for identifying the precincts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> What is the method? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have explained earlier, all the flats are ranked based on age, and the Member will notice that in the last seventh or eighth batches, precincts in Queensway which are older have been systematically shortlisted for upgrading. Similarly, flats in Toa Payoh, which are more than 25-30 years old, have also been shortlisted for upgrading. If we just maintain age as the sole criterion, then the upgrading would have been very lopsided in just these two areas. So we want to spread it out and therefore we gave one or two precincts per regional zone - one in the east, one in the north, one in the west and one in the central area. Again, if the Member checks through the seventh and eighth batches, he will notice that there is always a geographical spread. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also want to give priority to the 3-roomers because, as I have explained earlier, one of the objectives is not only to improve the environment but also to enhance the asset of the flat owners. So among the flats which are oldest, we also target the smaller flats. And now we are including the criterion of cleanliness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also work closely with town councils because when we identify a precinct, we want it to dovetail with the R&amp;R programme of the blocks. So we also consult the town councils on the major improvements that they are doing in their town councils to make sure that if there is an R&amp;R for the precinct and it coincides with the upgrading, then there are savings for the town council. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a method for identifying the precincts. We are reluctant to announce \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the precincts five years or 10 years ahead of time because there will be many changes. The programme is a rolling programme. There is an annual budget for it. There is an annual schedule. And one of the reasons why this programme has to proceed year by year is that the programme will only go ahead if there are significant budget surpluses to fund it. This is a $1 billion programme per year and we do not want to commit ourselves to a 5-year programme without making sure that there are budget surpluses to pay for these projects. So this is the reason why we cannot have a 5-year rolling plan. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I can now understand it better. From the Minister's answer just now, I understand that there is a ranking of flats which are 20 years or older. Would the Ministry at least publish the ranking of the flats? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I think the age of flats is common knowledge to everybody. We just go according to the age of the flats. We look at every estate and we rank the precincts according to the age of the flats. And we generally proceed with the upgrading of the oldest flats in the estate first, unless, of course, the precinct just had an R&amp;R and there is no point to go back and upgrade it one year after it has had its R&amp;R. So we will make certain adjustments to make sure that there is no wastage of public funds. But the age ranking is quite clear to everybody. Everybody knows when their flats were built. Everybody knows whether their flats are older or built later than their neighbouring flats. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree to publish the ranking? It is no good saying that people know about it. People will be interested to know what is the age of their flats compared with others who qualify for upgrading. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When we progress with estates or towns, this is also made known. For example, in Toa Payoh, we work closely with the town councils and grassroots organisations and we subdivide Toa Payoh into various precincts. In each of these precincts, they know when the flats \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> were built and therefore if there is a selection of precincts for upgrading, the town councils know in which sequence the flats will be selected for upgrading. Hougang is not due for upgrading for many, many years. So there is no need for us to consult the town council to designate the precincts and do the ranking. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Terms of ratification)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs (i) what terms have been ratified in, (ii) whether there are reservations on, and (iii) what are the national plans to comply with, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S.

First, as to what terms have been ratified, Singapore has ratified the entire Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part, yes, there are reservations. Sir, this is a very comprehensive international treaty with some 30 different Articles on a wide range of subjects affecting women. Many countries acceding to this Convention, indeed almost a third of all states/parties, have entered reservations. Singapore has also tabled four reservations which are mainly related to the protection of the rights of minorities in our multi-cultural society, our time-tested policies on immigration and citizenship, our labour and other laws which may have restrictions or conditions on the employment of women in certain areas for their own protection or for the protection of their unborn children. The four reservations tabled by Singapore are not unusual because many others have also tabled similar reservations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third part of her question, Sir, Singapore is a responsible member of the international community and we take our international obligations seriously. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Therefore, before acceding to this Convention, we have carefully studied its provisions in the context of our existing laws, values and practices and we have concluded that we have already met the aims of the Convention. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister then indicate that no further policy measures are necessary to honour the spirit and terms of the treaty? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As far as I can see, the Convention's provisions are in accord with existing laws, regulations and policies and I do not see any imminent need to take any further measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, would the Minister agree that the treaty obligates the Government to do a few things: (1) to change the national Constitution so that there is no sex discrimination; (2) to abolish existing laws and practices that practise sex discrimination; and (3) to set up institutions that will protect against discrimination? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, as far as we have been advised by our legal experts, the answer to all three questions is no, because there is no necessity to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Sir, I am not a legal expert.

The Convention is an international treaty. An international treaty carries with it certain treaty obligations, rights and privileges. Let me assure the House and the Member that whatever is legally obligated by the treaty upon Singapore, Singapore will, of course, comply with the obligations. But this is not a lay interpretation.

Would the Minister therefore care to make a comment on the quota of female medical students to the university? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter is really outside the ambit of the question asked by the Member. This is not to say that I or any of my colleagues would shy away from a debate, because I do know that the Member has raised this issue before, and the Minister for Education has in fact responded to her question of quota for medical students. In fact, if you look at the Hansard, it has been debated many years before and Dr Toh Chin Chye gave a full answer here, and that was some years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member feels strongly on this vis-a-vis the Convention, she is free to raise a Question at some other sitting. But I might add at this stage that I do not agree that any policies or laws of Singapore are in conflict with Article 10 which talks about equality of access of women in Singapore to educational institutions. In fact, I would have thought that the Member would stand up and cheer for Singapore, as we are one of the most progressive countries in the world in this regard. The National University of Singapore's admission intakes for the last three years show that more women have been admitted for each of these three years than men. In 1993, 3,885 women were admitted; men, 3,770. In 1994, 4,034 women were admitted compared to 3,994 men. Last year, 4,933 women were admitted compared to 4,137 men.

These are based on IRAS' primary mission of administering the tax system on behalf of the Government. However, the Act does not provide for IRAS to carry out other functions not related to tax administration, even though such functions are to be performed on behalf of other Government bodies and are more efficiently carried out by IRAS, for example, the collection of television licence fees. The Act also does not allow IRAS to provide consultancy in the computerisation of tax administration systems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable IRAS to cooperate more fully with other Government bodies and to better exploit the efficient systems which it has developed, I have decided to allow the Authority to carry out additional \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> functions subject to a proviso that these must be explicitly approved by the Minister for Finance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed clause thus amends section 6 to give legislative effect to this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau.]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> In page 1, line 4, the citation year \"1995\" will be changed to \"1996\".

Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is quite a complicated and technical Bill and I seek the indulgence of Mr Speaker and the House as I take the House through the main provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly, the Bill seeks to amend the Evidence Act for the following purposes: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to provide for the admissibility and weight of computer output produced by any computer or network as evidence in both civil and criminal proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to enable Rules to be made for the filing and receiving of evidence in court by the use of information technology (electronic filing). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, to allow accurate reproductions of documents produced by electronic, electrochemical, chemical, magnetic, optical or other technical processes to be admissible as secondary evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, to allow voluminous or complex evidence to be given in the form of charts, summaries or computer output in both civil and criminal proceedings; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, to allow evidence to be given by live video or live television links in certain civil proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the amendments deal with these matters which I have just mentioned. But there are two other separate amendments in the Bill. Let me say what they are at this moment. I will elaborate later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two amendments are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to reverse the common law rule (known as the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn [1943] English case) which excludes evidence of judicial findings of convictions or acquittals in subsequent cases; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to abolish the irrebutable presumption of law that a boy under the age of 13 years is incapable of committing rape. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about the first category of amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Replacing antiquated provisions</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments provide for the admissibility of information stored in computers, and the use of information technology in our courts. They are intended to replace the existing scheme to be found in sections 35 and 36. Those provisions were more suited to mainframe computers sited in specially designed premises, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. The use of personal computers at home and in the office is now common place, as is the linking of such computers to form vast networks that allow information to be entered, stored, altered and retrieved by a host of users in a global environment. Developments in document imaging technologies have also enabled users to keep images of their paper documents in electronic media, thereby \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> allowing them to save storage costs as the paper originals could then be destroyed. The law has therefore to be updated to facilitate the wider use of these new technologies. Such a law, of course, has to strike a balance between guaranteeing the reliability of evidence produced by such technologies and ensuring that the admissibility of such evidence is not hampered by complicated conditions and procedures. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Need for computer-related amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments are required as large institutions such as the Inland Revenue have already implemented document imaging technology for the processing of taxpayers returns. Many business transactions are now conducted on-line, particularly through the use of Tradenet. Members will also know that the Technology Court has been set up, and many other public and private sector institutions are already working through electronic networks, dispensing with paper transactions and documentation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Scope of sections 35 and 36</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended and re-enacted sections 35 and 36 are wide enough to cover traditional computer print-outs as well as multi-media and graphical outputs. The provisions can cover outputs from a stand-alone or portable computer and those from local area or wide area networks. They also apply to both civil and criminal proceedings. In general, both the private and public sectors are subject to the same requirements unless special circumstances warrant otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Three ways to admit computer output</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended sections 35 and 36 will provide for three different ways to admit computer output. Briefly, they are, firstly by way of express agreement between the parties to the proceedings (or between public prosecutor and defence counsel). The second way is by showing that the computer output came from \"an approved \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> process\" (where the network is independently audited). The third route is by showing that in a particular case, the output came from a source that is working properly at all material times. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Express agreement</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may elaborate on these three matters. Express agreement can be made at any time, even during the proceedings. Section 35(2) provides that in criminal proceedings, the accused must be represented on this issue. That is a safeguard. This is because there should be no room for an allegation that the prosecution tricked the accused into agreeing to admit such evidence. This practice follows that already existing in the Criminal Procedure Code as regards formal admissions. An agreement can be vitiated by proof of duress, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Approved process</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the second method, the approved process. Where a computer output is produced from an \"approved process\", the presumption is that the output is accurate unless proven otherwise. Such a process is approved when it is audited and certified by an agency that is appointed by the Minister in accordance with the regulations. The audit will need to be carried out by an independent body whose audit will be based on a set of compliance criteria established by the authority. Any institution that takes the necessary steps to obtain certification as an approved process may, of course, then destroy their paper documents with confidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Certification by Systems Operators or Information Systems Managers</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, where computer output is tendered without express agreement or \"approved process\" certification, the party tendering such output will have to show through an affidavit and certificate from the Systems Operator (Sysops) or Information System Manager (IS Manager) that there is no reason to doubt the truth or reliability of the output, and that at all \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> material times, the system was operating properly or, if not, that the accuracy of the output was not adversely affected. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is no Systems Operator or the IS Manager available, the section allows an expert with access to the system to provide the necessary certification. This provision can also be used where the Systems Operator or the IS Manager is suspected, for example, of computer misuse or other fraud and therefore refuses to cooperate with the authorities. If I may give an example. Police computer experts may, for example, gain access to a system belonging to a suspect purveying electronic pornography. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Court may call for further evidence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where a court is not satisfied with the accuracy of the output, it may call for further evidence under section 36. Such evidence may be provided by affidavits or oral examination of the relevant operators and persons. Evidence may also be given by an independent expert appointed or accepted by the court. If the court is still not satisfied, it may call for oral evidence from the deponent of an affidavit. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New section 36A on Rules of filing and receiving evidence and documents in court by using information technology (Electronic Filing)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to new section 36A. It enables the Supreme Court Rules Committee to make Rules to provide for the filing and receiving of evidence and documents in court by the use of information technology. It will enable the legal framework to be constructed for electronic filing of court documents and the Technology Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>New section 62A on video link testimony</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to new section 62A which allows a witness with leave of the court to give evidence through a live video or live television link in civil proceedings. This will be allowed in any of these circumstances: where the witness is below 16 years of age; where it is expressly agreed between the parties to the proceedings that evidence may be so given; where the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> witness is outside Singapore; or where the court is satisfied that it is expedient in the interest of justice to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This section is intended to create a proper legislative framework and to clarify and enlarge the court's powers in relation to evidence given by live video and television links. Let me clarify that it does not mean that the Court did not have jurisdiction to order the evidence of a witness to be taken by live video or television links in civil proceedings before the enactment of this amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, Sir, that the court must not make an order for video link testimony or include a particular provision in such an order, if to do so would be inconsistent with the court's duty to ensure that the proceedings are conducted fairly for the parties. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Secondary evidence - section 65(b)</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may move to section 65(b). The types of secondary evidence have been increased to include computer output, to ensure the proper operation of other admissibility sections. A new illustration has been added to that section to show clearly the nature of the output which will be accepted as judicial evidence. That illustration reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(ba) A copy of a document in the form of a print-out, or image on a monitor screen, retrieved from a magnetic or optical storage device, such as a tape, hard disk, laser-disc or CD-ROM, is secondary evidence of the contents of the document if it is shown that the copy retrieved from the storage device satisfies the conditions providing for the admissibility of such output.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to this section will ensure the admissibility of such output as secondary evidence where the conditions for the use of such evidence are justified, eg, where the original has been destroyed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Section 68A - Manner of giving voluminous or complex evidence</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to new section 68A. This amendment facilitates the use of multi-media technology in the courtroom of the future in the presentation of voluminous or complex evidence. An important safeguard which has been built into this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> provision is that any relationship among facts or opinions which asserted in the presentation of such complex materials must be subsequently proved by evidence that is otherwise independently admissible. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Section 45A - Reversing the Rule in Hollington v Hewthorn</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move to new section 45A concerning the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn. Section 45A is to reverse a common law rule (known among lawyers as the rule in Hollington v Hewthorn, an English case) that operated to exclude evidence of judicial findings of convictions or acquittals from admissibility in subsequent cases. This common law rule states that the evidence in an earlier criminal case cannot be admitted against the defendant in a later civil trial, although, as is known, the standard of proof is higher in a criminal case. For example, a criminal conviction for dangerous driving is inadmissible as evidence of negligence in a civil action for causing personal injuries to the other driver. Reversing this rule means that judicial time and legal costs will be saved by not having to litigate all over again issues which have been decided by another court in previous proceedings. The amendments, Sir, on this matter are similar to provisions in the English and Australian legislation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Section 115 - Abolition of irrebuttable presumption that boy under 13 years of age is incapable of rape</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to the amendment to repeal section 115. Section 115 is repealed to abolish the irrebuttable presumption of law that a boy under 13 years of age is incapable of committing rape. This archaic rule is inconsistent with the realities of this day and age with children reaching physical maturity at an earlier age. The equivalent common law rule in the United Kingdom was recently abolished by the Sexual Offences Act 1993. Of course, the possibility of a rapist below 13 years of age is remote, but such a young rapist, if \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the case ever occurs, ought not to go off completely scot-free merely because of this technicality in the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Drafting of proposed amendments</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments were drafted by a committee led by the Dean of the Law Faculty, comprising members from the Judiciary, the Attorney-General's Chambers, MINDEF Legal Services and the universities. They considered other comparable legislation from Australia, Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom and the USA. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Consultations with relevant organisations</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Judiciary, National Computer Board, the Auditor-General, the Ministry of Information and the Arts and the Ministry of Finance have been consulted and they support the relevant amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Society and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants have also been consulted and many of their views have been taken into account in the final draft of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Conclusion</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, Sir, I believe these amendments will provide a good legislative framework for the admissibility and use of computer generated evidence which we can expect to become increasingly important in today's era of information technology. It will bring our Courts into the forefront of information technology with the use of computer technology in the form of computer generated presentations and graphics in our Technology Courts. The proposed amendments also take into account further developments in computer and information technology in the coming years and into the 21st Century. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

They are not issued to finance Government's expenditure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the proceeds and expenditure of treasury bills are currently accounted for under the Consolidated Fund. As a result, the Consolidated Fund is inflated each time proceeds from the issue of treasury bills are paid into it, and are drawn down when bills are redeemed or when related expenses are incurred, even though these do not form part of Government's expenditure. To avoid such distortions to the Consolidated Fund, we have decided to account for the proceeds and expenditure of treasury bills under the Government Securities Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Securities Fund, or GSF for short, was set up in March 1992 as a self-contained fund to account for all loans, other than those raised to finance development projects. The proceeds from the issue of Government securities are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> paid into the GSF. The redemption and related interest payments of Government securities are also charged upon and payable out of the GSF. Bringing the treasury bills under the ambit of the GSF will rationalise Government's debt accounting practices through the use of a single fund, which is the GSF. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill amends sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Local Treasury Bills Act by deleting the words \"Consolidated Fund\" wherever they appear and substituting them with the \"Government Securities Fund\".

I would like to take this opportunity to describe the background for the setting up of the new Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a major maritime nation. The Port of Singapore has been the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> world's busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage since 1986. Last year, more than 100,000 vessels called at Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also operates one of the world's busiest container ports. Last year, our container terminals handled more than 11 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units. With a vast catchment area stretching from the east coast of Africa to the shores of Australasia, Singapore is one of the major hub ports of the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a hub port, the Port of Singapore plays a significant role in enhancing the economic competitiveness of the region. Because Singapore has a high frequency of shipping connections, exporters find it more convenient and cheaper to ship their precious cargo through Singapore. Deliveries can be made on time because our port works smoothly. These factors contribute to the competitive edge of exporters which use Singapore to tranship their goods. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These achievements have been made possible largely through the untiring efforts, foresight, dedication and innovation of the staff and management of the Port of Singapore. It has won customers by providing highly efficient and cost-competitive container-handling and marine services. Ships are turned around quickly which is particularly important in an era of increasingly expensive mother container vessels. This contribution to our competitiveness was recognised when Singapore was placed first among 42 economies in 1994 in the \"World Competitiveness Report\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, PSA cannot rest on its laurels. It must keep improving in the face of increasingly fierce competition from regional ports for a share of the booming container business. Regional ports are expanding. There are plans to build new ports. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay ahead, the Government has decided to corporatise the Port of Singapore Authority in the next few years to better enable PSA to face the challenges which it will meet in the next century. PSA's commercial activities in cargo terminal operations as well as in marine services will be corporatised. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a corporatised entity, PSA will have more flexibility to operate and invest in the region. And this together with private sector discipline and greater market orientation will sharpen PSA's competitive edge as it faces growing regional competition in the container-handling business. Corporatisation will also put PSA in a stronger position to operate a hub port that will continue to contribute to the economic development of Singapore and the surrounding region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporatised PSA will subsequently be listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. This is part of the Government's plan to enhance the assets of our citizens and to give them a stake in our country's wealth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporatised PSA will have to be regulated to ensure that there is no abuse of its market dominance. One of the key lessons in privatising a statutory board is that the regulator should be established before corporatisation takes place. We therefore propose to set up the MPA to license and regulate the port industry before PSA is corporatised. Setting up MPA ahead of PSA's corporatisation will give it sufficient time to work out a good regulatory system as well as to build up the necessary expertise and standing to regulate the post-corporatisation port industry. There will also be more time to sort out any grey areas that may arise as we embark on this corporatisation exercise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it would not be correct for a private company to have statutory powers, such as control over navigational safety in the port, the Government has decided to transfer PSA's powers to MPA even while PSA remains a statutory board. At the same time, the Government will revamp the structure of port and maritime administration in Singapore by incorporating the National Maritime Board (NMB) and the Marine Department into MPA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA's mission is to protect our strategic maritime interest and to promote Singapore as a major port and an international maritime centre. As the sole agency responsible for all port and maritime issues in Singapore, MPA would be expected to monitor and to assess the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> impact of regional as well as international developments in the port and maritime world on our port and to take appropriate measures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA will be a self-funding statutory board. It will have a staff strength of about 500 personnel, 350 of whom will come from PSA with the rest coming from the NMB and Marine Department. Although smaller than the PSA, the new Authority will be no less important than PSA in terms of the scope of its duties and functions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA will perform the roles of the National Maritime Board and Marine Department as well as license and regulate PSA when PSA is corporatised. As soon as MPA is set up, it will also take over statutory functions from PSA, such as ensuring navigational safety in our port waters and drawing up the port masterplan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPA will look at sea transport issues from a national viewpoint. The issues will include wide-ranging and global issues, covering important strategic issues such as the Malacca Straits, which is our economic lifeline to the Middle East and the West. MPA will seek to cooperate with other countries and international organisations to develop a framework in which Singapore's position as a global maritime centre will be enhanced. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSA will become a pure service provider once MPA is formed - it will provide cargo-handling services and supporting marine services such as pilotage and tugboat services. Within the context of the MPA's port masterplan, PSA will continue to develop additional cargo terminal facilities. So, in essence, PSA will become a cargo terminal developer and operator once MPA is formed. And this will enable PSA to focus on its commercial role. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address the key provisions of the MPA Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill sets out the functions and duties of the Authority. The key functions of the MPA, as I said, are to promote the use, improvement and development of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the port; control vessel movements and ensure navigational safety; license and regulate marine services and facilities, such as pilotage services, tugboats and waterboats, as well as port services and facilities, such as container and conventional cargo terminals, and also to regulate the port industry's economic behaviour. The MPA will train seafarers and promote the development of merchant shipping. The MPA will also advise the Government on matters relating to sea transport, marine and port services and facilities, and represent Singapore internationally on these matters. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Minister's approval, the Authority may levy rates, charges, dues and fees for the use of services and facilities provided by MPA, as well as levy the maritime welfare fee, port dues and goods dues. The annual tonnage tax currently collected by the Marine Department will continue to be paid into the Consolidated Fund. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA Bill provides for the transfer of assets from the PSA, NMB and Marine Department to MPA. The staff working in these organisations will be transferred to the Authority at terms no less favourable than those that they enjoyed immediately prior to their transfer. Pension rights of existing pensionable officers will be preserved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority is empowered to regulate the employment of seamen. This is a function transferred to MPA from the National Maritime Board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill enables MPA to make regulations for the control and management of the port. MPA will have the power to declare any area in the port to be a pilotage district. It can regulate pilotage in the port. It can also regulate and control certain activities, such as dredging within the port and territorial waters. Again these are powers which are being transferred from PSA to MPA. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill states that no person shall provide marine or port facilities without a public licence or exemption from MPA. The Authority may put into a public licence a provision to control or fix the tariffs charged by the licensee in respect \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the handling and storage of cargo other than transhipment cargo. Transhipment cargo will not be regulated because the transhipment business is an international one in which the local terminal operator competes with other ports in the region and competition will provide the necessary checks in the system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for local cargo, the Bill provides a safeguard against exploitation of market power by enabling MPA to regulate the tariffs charged for the handling of local cargo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA Bill provides that the Minister may make a special administration order in relation to a licensee operating a container terminal directing the affairs, business and property of such a licensee to be managed by the Authority. The reason why this power is needed is to ensure the uninterrupted movement of cargo into and out of Singapore. Since the container terminals handle most of Singapore's exports and imports, any disruption in terminal operations could cause the economy to grind to a halt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequential amendments will be made to several Acts. The main Act affected, of course, will be the PSA Act. Many of its provisions will be repealed and transferred to the MPA Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of MPA is a significant step forward in Singapore's maritime development. It represents several months of intensive work by officers of my Ministry who have come up with a framework which lays much of the groundwork for PSA's impending corporatisation, and it also incorporates the necessary powers and mechanisms for the effective functioning and regulation of a post-corporatisation port industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we approach the beginning of a new millennium, important challenges lie ahead of us as we strive to improve Singapore's position as a hub port and a major international maritime centre. We will need the right institutional framework to steer us through uncharted waters. I believe that this is provided by the MPA Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the impending corporatisation of PSA in 1997, it is now timely and correct to separate the operator (PSA) from the regulator (MPA). The reasons for corporatisation of PSA have been explained by the Minister. The MPA will be formed by merging the Maritime Department, the National Maritime Board and the parts of PSA which undertake statutory functions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing competition to provide equally good if not better port services in the region, it is timely that the MPA is formed. Besides its regulatory function, there must be a central agency like the MPA which has the resources and will effectively monitor events regionally and globally to protect our maritime interests and to ensure that we remain an efficient and competitive port. Our long-term strategic maritime interests must be continually updated so that we will remain a major port and an International Maritime Centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a port industry regulator, the MPA will have to ensure that the providers of services to our ports, eg, pilotage, will be of high standard, especially when issues of safety are concerned. The privatisation of pilotage is especially of concern to the GPC, as this is linked to safety in a very crowded port. I am sure that the Minister would like to reassure the House that this is an area that will be under careful scrutiny. Furthermore, to maintain competitiveness, service standards must be set by the MPA and must be met by the operator. In this context, I would like to ask the Minister whether it is his intention to have more than one operator, ie, besides PSA, will there be other operators? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister whether it is also timely to have a forum under the MPA whereby the operators, the port users and the port regulators can meet and share their common worries and make strategic plans ahead. This is similar to the Public Transport Council for land transport. This group should not only discuss money matters but also plan strategically together for the future to ensure that Singapore maintains its competitive edge as the number one port. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as in all exercises of this sort where several existing bodies are amalgamated into one, I would like to seek an assurance from the Minister that the interests of the staff have been fairly looked into. Furthermore, the National Maritime Board which looks after our seafarers now comes under the MPA. Although the MPA has a very large charter and the number of Singapore seafarers is not large, it is important that the interest of our seafarers deserves careful monitoring by the MPA. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Dr Arthur Beng for supporting the Bill. He asked several questions. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the issues involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very important question is whether there will be other cargo terminal operators in Singapore after PSA is corporatised. Whether the Government will introduce one or more cargo terminal operators after corporatisation of PSA depends on several factors. First of all, we would have to look at the overall level of competition that is faced by PSA. As I indicated in my speech just now, the transhipment business is an international business. And as an international business, PSA actually does face competition. So we must take this into account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other transhipment centres which compete with PSA. For example, on the trans-Pacific route, PSA competes with Kaohsiung in Taiwan. On the European route, competition comes from Colombo. That is the first issue we will have to tackle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have to be mindful of the fact that a port depends very heavily on economies of scale. Overhead costs involved in building a port and in running a port are very high - gantry cranes, land reclamation, etc. And if these overhead costs can be spread over larger and larger volumes of containers handled, the unit cost will come down and economies of scale will set in. But we must also recognise that at some stage, diseconomies of scale will also be possible. At this stage, I believe \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that this has not yet happened with PSA, but this is something that we have to be mindful of. So I cannot say with certainty whether there will be a second or even a third cargo terminal operator in Singapore. But I can say that we are not closing the door to such a possibility of domestic competition. We should leave our options open and my Ministry, together with the MPA and, of course, in discussion with PSA as well, will consider all these factors carefully before we decide. The overriding consideration, of course, is what is in the best interest of Singapore and the Singapore economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the interests of staff are concerned, the Bill specifically provides that all the staff from PSA, Marine Department and the National Maritime Board will be transferred to MPA and they will enjoy terms that are no less favourable than those currently enjoyed by them. Indeed, the various unions that are representing these staff members have been briefed on the MPA's terms and conditions of service and I am pleased to see that they are agreeable that these terms and conditions are fair. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Beng also asked about protection of seafarers' interests. The seafarers' interests are currently being handled by the National Maritime Board (NMB). And when the MPA is set up, this function will be transferred from the NMB. The new Authority will continue to train seafarers to promote their welfare as well as to develop, promote and regulate their employment. Again, the relevant staff unions have been consulted. In this case, the Singapore Organisation of Seamen (SOS) as well as the Singapore Maritime Officers' Union (SMOU) have been briefed on the setting up of the MPA and they have been assured that the MPA will continue to discharge effectively the functions of the NMB. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Chairman:</b> In page 1, line 6, the citation year \"1995\" will be changed to \"1996\".

It affects our lifestyle, where we work, where we live, how our children go to school, and how we spend our leisure hours. It is a major economic activity, directly providing jobs for 28,000 people and indirectly many more. It accounts directly for 1.3% of our GDP. Families spend about 14% of their disposable income on transport. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that there are four essentials in life - yi, shi, zhu, xing - [ ] clothing, food, housing and transport. Singaporeans are well-clothed, well-fed and well-housed. The question is: do they also enjoy a good transport system? I believe I can say with very little fear of contradiction that the answer is yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have succeeded so far in keeping our roads congestion free. Our bus, rail and taxi network is one of the most comprehensive in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent Lianhe Zaobao survey on the lifestyle of Singaporeans, 97% of the 565 respondents said that they were satisfied with the public transport system, 27% said that they were \"very satisfied\" and 70% \"somewhat satisfied\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another survey commissioned by the Straits Times Life! section showed similar findings. In its report of 2nd January 1996, it noted that two out of three or 66% of the 538 respondents said that the overall public transport system was \"good\", 33% found the system \"so so\", and only 1% reported and rated it \"poor\". In fact, the level of overall satisfaction reported was higher than that found by Lianhe Zaobao. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are now more well travelled and they are more well read. They are now more aware of the severe traffic problems in many other cities. So the surveys perhaps reflect a better appreciation of what we do have and what we do enjoy in Singapore. All of us now must be keenly aware that we have not achieved this through doing nothing, simply leaving the vehicle population to grow unmanaged, unrestricted or to leave our public transport system to degenerate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land transport is management intensive. We have to keep on fine-tuning it. We have to keep on coming up with new initiatives in order to ensure that our roads continue to be free-flowing. Even though we do these things, already there are areas where traffic is building up and congestion is getting unacceptably persistent. I still receive lots of complaints about the difficulty of getting taxis. There is still the issue of COE prices and people's aspirations for car-ownership \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 471</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unfulfilled. These, as they say, are the problems of success, of many years of high economic growth, of full employment and high wages and, more importantly, of confidence in our future. But, if we do not take action now to solve these problems, again they will erode our competitiveness and affect our growth. A good transport system is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. It supports our economy and it enhances our quality of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue before us is how we can, within the constraints of the limited land that we have, provide the best mobility for Singaporeans today, and meet our transport needs into the next century. Members have on many occasions in this House suggested various ways to improve our transport system. I agree with many of their suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the importance of land transport to each and everyone of us and to the nation as a whole, and considering its complexity, the issue cannot be dealt with piecemeal. It has to be taken as a whole. Private and public transport policies and measures have to be considered together. They are inter-linked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paradox is that while the car is highly valued partly for its ability to provide a high degree of mobility, an unrestrained growth in the number of cars leads to congestion which in turn means less mobility for all road-users, including the car users. But car users argue that they are not willing to give up the convenience of the car for public transport because it is slow and unreliable. Buses are slow and unreliable, in turn, partly because of congestion. Inefficient and inadequate public transport drives more to want to own and use private cars, and so on it goes, in a vicious circle. The story is a familiar one in many cities around the world. And that is why I say that for this entire transport issue to be addressed, we have to do it in a holistic manner and on a comprehensive basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last March, I informed the House that the Government would set up a new statutory board, called the Land Transport \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Authority (LTA), to spearhead all efforts to plan and implement a road transport system which will meet the needs of Singapore, now and in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the LTA is a significant milestone in the Government's efforts to keep Singapore and Singaporeans on the move. As a single integrated agency, the Authority will be able to ensure that the transport projects and measures that have been carried out previously by separate agencies, complement one another in the most effective and cost-efficient manner. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the LTA was launched in September last year, I challenged the Authority to develop an outstanding, world class land transport system for Singapore, one that can stand alongside our port and airport in efficiency and cost-effectiveness, one that is integrated, convenient, reliable, comfortable, and most importantly, affordable not only for the commuter but also for the nation as a whole. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper before this House presents the transport planning philosophy and strategies that the LTA will adopt. It spells out the LTA's vision of a world class transport system for Singapore, and it outlines a series of measures that the Authority proposes to take to achieve this mission. Let me just run through the various measures that are encompassed within this multi-pronged strategy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, integrating urban and transport planning. This is the starting point. This is to minimise the need to travel and to maximise the accessibility of public transport. Mixing residential and work places reduces the need to travel long distances and therefore reduces pressure on our road space and transport system. More intensive developments around as well as on top of MRT stations, bus stations, bus interchanges, maximise the accessibility of public transport and minimise the need for private transport, and integrating different transport facilities together so that transfer between different modes of transport becomes seamless which in turn increases the attractiveness of public transport. So that is pillar number one - integrating land use and transport planning. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, expanding our road network. Our road network will continue to be expanded where it makes sense from both the traffic as well as the planning point of view and where land is available. The feasibility of underground roads, which are much more expensive to construct and maintain, will be considered. As far as possible, technology will be harnessed to optimise road design and maximise road capacity. That is the second measure. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, improving the management of vehicle usage to sustain higher vehicle population. No matter which way we turn, we cannot escape the fact that land in Singapore is finite, which means that road capacity is finite. Despite our best efforts in maximising the carrying capacity of our roads with new technology and design, ownership of vehicles and usage of limited road space must continue to be managed. The Vehicle Quota System has worked well for us; it has been accepted by Singaporeans. It will be retained. But we can increase car ownership from 1 in 10 today to 1 in 7, say, in about 15 years' time. This can be achieved only if we can complement the better transport planning and design with usage management. More comprehensive road pricing will have to be implemented. And this allows road users to make better choices, more informed choices, about when to use and where to use their cars. Conceptually, what this means is that those roads which are more congested will cost more to use and charges can also vary with the time of day, again depending on the level of congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last strategy is to improve our public transport system. This is the cornerstone of the land transport strategy. To satisfy the transport needs of commuters and to provide a viable alternative to the car, we need an outstanding public transport system. To do this, the LTA will increase the spectrum of public transport services and service levels, so that Singaporeans can enjoy a wide-ranging, quality transport service that matches their preference and suits their pocket. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support our vision for a world class public transport system, the LTA has also \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> set out to revise the financing formula for rail projects. The revised formula or the redefinition of the current arrangement lowers the hurdle rate, in other words, reduces the passing mark for rail projects. As a result, some rail projects which were previously not viable may now become viable. Or others that were not viable may now be built earlier than previously intended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our basic policies and infrastructure are sound. The reason why we can be where we are today - relatively free-flowing roads, no gridlock during peak hours, and a generally acceptable public transport network, compared to many other cities, is testimony to the planning and foresight of government planners in earlier years. The Government has always taken a proactive approach in transport management. But the Ministry of Communications and the LTA recognise that we have to do more, by building on the solid foundations that have been set in place. To do nothing now when the trends are clear, will only saddle ourselves and our future generation with a situation which we all know is untenable for our future development. This would be irresponsible on our part. As an editorial in Berita Harian put it, we need to solve this problem and I quote, \"a heritage to future generations\" (in Malay: \"warisan bagi generasi hari muka\"). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put things in perspective, the strategies in the White Paper do not merely spell out how LTA will treat private car owners, or how it will improve public transport, or how it will build more roads per se. All the measures and the policies proposed should be seen as part of a comprehensive strategy to satisfy not only the growing demand for transport, but also the aspirations for a better quality and a higher level of transport services. These measures are all inter-linked. One cannot work without the others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we cannot manage demand for cars without providing good public transport alternatives. We cannot improve public transport without managing usage of roads, and integrating land use and transport planning. We \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> cannot grow our rail network without reviewing our financing framework for rail extensions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper will serve as a starting point for establishing an understanding, a kind of a social contract among the Government, the people, and the transport service providers on the kind of land transport system that we want: How do we develop and sustain a world class land transport system under the new financing framework? How do commuters co-share responsibility for public transport improvements? To what extent do we, as a nation and as individuals, want to invest in and spend on infrastructure for public transport? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up these measures and proposals, the LTA has been mindful of not just the dollars and cents, but also of the social concerns and the long term implications. And that is why in our policies, we strive to be as fair as possible to all. Often, this means that all road users will pay a little price, some more than others, to ensure that the interests of the majority are served. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our second concern is that we should be fair to future generations. This is to ensure that they too will have a chance to enjoy the comfort and convenience of free-flowing traffic. They too will have a chance to fulfil their aspiration to own cars. Thirdly, this requires of us a willingness and a resolve to implement policies for the long-term good of our country, even if sometimes these measures may be unpopular in the short term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fourthly, we need to spend the taxpayers' money, our money, wisely at the national level. The business of transporting goods and people is not just about traffic management alone. It is also about the need to grapple with economic and social impact of allocating limited road space and opportunities for vehicle usage and fostering an environment that is conducive to good public transport services and their use. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the White Paper was presented to Parliament on 2nd January this year, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> my Ministry has received numerous comments, suggestions and feedback from the public, trade associations, and Members of Parliament directly and through the media. Some have suggested new ways of managing demand. Others have commented on how the LTA should go about developing the road network, and how it should go about developing and improving public transport, and so on. Many have expressed concern about the cost implications. But without exception, all have expressed support for the objectives spelt out in the White Paper. This has been most encouraging. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of this House for the White Paper will signal its commitment to build a transport system befitting our vision of a city of excellence and one which all of us can be proud of. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I look forward to the views and comments of hon. Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>3.17 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the GPC fully supports and endorses this White Paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this thought-provoking White Paper brings to dawn on Singapore and Singaporeans a vision which we will all want to see come true: \"A World Class Land Transport System\". Through the pages are colourful charts, graphs, maps and photographs which make the visualisation of a difficult futuristic concept possible and simple. It fires us to want to achieve it, not years down the road, but very soon, and hopefully tomorrow. However, the White Paper reminds us that it will take us 10-15 years to attain this vision. Two questions then arise: What happens in the intervening period? Can we not shorten this period? As the initial excitement and euphoria ebbs, impatience begins to set in. Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper was received with a lot of excitement. Friends and grassroots leaders asked for copies of it. I understand that even Parliament House Library is running short of copies. Later, many asked: Why does it take so long to achieve? Are we not known to achieve \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> great strides in a short time? Expectations run extremely high! Then over the last few days, anxiety has set in. How much will it cost? What happens in the intervening period? Is this a signal to impending increases to bus, taxi and MRT fares? The rumours begin. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has comprehensively covered all aspects of land transportation in Singapore, from environmental issues to integration, to financing issues. The authors must be congratulated. The Paper has set measurable goals and standards, eg, a target of 75% of trips into the city by public transport and a rail system with a 160 km network. Qualitatively, it will offer high quality service - convenient, accessible, comfortable, safe, speedy and, most importantly, affordable. Very importantly, the commuter will be provided with \"a spectrum of choices\". All these objectives are most welcomed and will indeed enhance the quality of life of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is not what Mr Chiam has called \"an election ploy\". Indeed, it is a White Paper that will have a resounding impact on the quality of all our lives. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Private Vehicle Ownership Vs Usage</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, on the issue of privately owned vehicles versus usage. Sir, one of the most basic objectives is to have a shift from private transport, ie, private cars to public transport, to decrease road congestion. The aim, in measurable terms, is to reach the goal whereby 75% of trips into the city centre will be by public transport as is in Zurich today. Before we accuse Singaporeans of being obsessed by car ownership, let us compare Zurich and Singapore. Our hot and humid weather for one is definitely less inviting for walking. Singaporeans are also very pragmatic people. The system today is one where the upfront cost of owning a car comprises 59.4% of a medium sized car to 68.5% of a luxury car. Therefore, if you own a car, you will want to use it. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to anyone that the mileage clocked by a car in Singapore averages 18,600 km per year - very high by international standards. I also suspect that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this is because the car is often shared and therefore maximally utilized by several members (or drivers) in a family. I will not be unduly perturbed by this figure. Singaporeans, being pragmatic, I am also confident that this figure will fall as the policy shifts towards control over usage coupled with a more user-friendly public transport network. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the anxieties that have been expressed concern the intervening period or the transition period between ownership controls, or the Vehicle Quota System on the one hand, and the implementation of the user-pay system, the RPS, and subsequently the ERP. The White Paper calls for a \"partnership\". For the partnership to succeed, the interim period must be fair. The White Paper states, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`as we introduce ERP, we will concurrently rationalise the current road tax structure\"; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We aim for a more consistent vehicle tax structure, based on road space occupied, after giving proper regard to social and equity considerations'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are very loaded statements, and one requires not only to have a good command of English but also very strong intuition to translate this to simple understandable English. Can the Minister please explain in simple terms: What will the new road tax structure be? Will it be lower which we expect it to be? Will it be based on engine capacity, car size or tonnage? What will it be based? What is the system? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we are told that there is a need to \"extend RPS to CTE and PIE within the next two years\"; \"we cannot wait for ERP to be ready, because by then the traffic would have deteriorated even further\". Sir, in this transition period, is it not unfair to penalise those who have paid upfront for their vehicles? For a partnership to be forged, attention to \"fairness\" must be paid in this interim period while public transport is being upgraded. The element of choices is not widely available now. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Improving Public Transport: Buses</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every day 51% of all motorised trips are by public transport: 3 million by bus, and another 700,000 by MRT. It will take \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> another three to four years for the first Light Rail Transit (LRT) to be completed if we start today, while an MRT extension like the North-East Line would take seven to eight years to complete if we start today. Therefore, for the next five years or more, buses will play a key role in the public transport system. However, we are also told that \"buses cannot be the solution for a compact city like Singapore\" and that the \"only acceptable solution is a good rail network\" which takes time to build. When I put all these together, I was very concerned for the immediate future - the next five to eight years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when we examine our bus industry structure we realise that we have two very successful service providers, viz SBS and TIBS. Can they play a bigger role? They must play a bigger role. Government has made the commitment of an infrastructure by setting aside bus lanes, giving priority to buses at traffic lights with the installation of \"intelligent\" traffic lights and provided modern integrated bus interchanges, as we have seen in the new Woodlands depot. More choices will be offered to commuters, such as BusPlus services, air-conditioned express services, etc. In addition to these, I would urge the bus companies to improve quickly intra-town services and feeder services from the MRT stations to major office buildings scattered all around them. Perhaps, the bus companies should work closely with building developers and owners and tenants to \"market\" and understand their needs. A more pro-active approach is required to provide for good integration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read with interest the request by SBS for Government assistance in replacing of assets. What is the Government's response to this? This would have far-reaching implications. If the Government's response is positive then an even-handed approach must be made to all public transport operations. Is this wise? I have my reservations. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Improving Public Transport: Taxis</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, taxis provide 500,000 vehicular trips per day compared to 700,000 by the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> MRT, not far different. I am glad that the Government recognises that \"taxi is a form of public transport\" and that \"it will therefore not treat taxis completely like cars in terms of tax.\" It did not say it will not treat taxis differently from cars. I guess there must be some implication in these wordings. However, this reassurance is welcomed by all commuters. These are two very important statements. I can understand the concern that an \"excessive demand\" for taxis should not arise. It is stated in the White Paper that our taxi fares are low by international standards. I, however, submit that in view of our less than perfect public transport system that taxis today are a \"key component\" in our public transport system. Taxis are the bridge in our not yet integrated public transport system. We have a good system. It is comprehensive. But it is not yet integrated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transition period of the next 10 to 15 years, to price taxis very high will increase car ownership and stifle the desired trend to shift towards public transportation. In the call to partnership, the LTA must also be understanding and patient. Allow for time for the integration process, allow for time for the building of light rail as a nexus in public transportation before raising taxi fares. The public is often asked to restrain car ownership and usage. This is a restraint on the part of the LTA that is essential in this interim period. I am sure that the taxi companies will take steps to function more efficiently by using technology such as global positioning to reduce cruising and wastage, which also adds to traffic congestion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Improving Public Transport: Integration</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the effectiveness of the LTA is shown by the model of the new Woodlands MRT station where there is integration to allow for private car drop-offs, bus interchange, taxi bays and covered walkways. The LTA must now look into the old stations; an example of a poorly designed one is exemplified by the Buona Vista MRT station. Integration will be the key to success of the public \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> transport system. The Minister has already mentioned about integration between urban planning and transport and we fully endorse his views. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Improving Public Transport: Rail</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have left the rail system as the last topic in this debate, not because it is unimportant. Indeed, the White Paper states that it will be a most important mode of transport: the combination of light and heavy rail. I have left it to the last because it will be many years before we see new rail systems come into place after Woodlands and to place too much emphasis on it now will only raise expectations too high, and to feel let down while waiting for routes to be prescribed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is something that can be done immediately to improve the existing MRT system. Take the criticisms of the MRT seriously, as recorded in the White Paper, and these are, (1) overcrowding during peak hours (56%) and, (2) stations not easily accessible (32%), ie, integration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned to the Minister previously that his residents in Tampines, and mine in Bedok, are taking the MRT to Pasir Ris in the morning, just to catch the next train back to the city because of overcrowding during peak hours. This is wastage. The situation has not improved since our discussion about a year ago. As the White Paper states, \"These areas need to be addressed\", but I would like to have one more word \"urgently\". These areas need to be addressed urgently. These are the areas that the LTA can address now, while we wait for the vision that will arrive in 10 to 15 years of underground roads, integrated stations, multilevel traffic intersections, etc. These can be done now. Let us attend to it while waiting for a \"world class\" land transport system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last night, after my meet-the-people session, I discussed this topic again with my grassroots leaders. I explained that the operators use an index called the crush load. How many can you pack in a cabin? Their response was very telling. There may be a big gap between what the operators expect and what the commuters expect. One of my Chairmen said, \"Dr \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Beng, not only are we in contact, we can even smell each other. Is that close enough for your crush load?\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst working on this system of differentiation in bus services, we can also look into the differentiation in MRT services. Could we have services where seating is provided and maybe the commuters will pay more or services where the crush load is less and transportation then becomes more comfortable, a differentiation even within the MRT system? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Financing of Rail Systems</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the change in policy to define operating costs to cover not full replacement cost but only depreciation of existing assets shows our Government's commitment to make rail fares affordable. Philosophically, it means that each generation will pay for the services and assets it consumes. As applied to the present existing rail system, it translates into an immediate fare increase of 30 cents across the board if the old financing system is retained. This is our Government's commitment. This is considerable and a generous and welcome gesture as it will also mean that the implementation of the rail system can be brought forward by a few years. This is indeed good news. Can the Minister be more specific with reference to the rail extension mentioned in the White Paper, both MRT and LRT? With this new financing scheme, how many of these projects will be realisable and can commence work in the next two years? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>North-East Line</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to dwell a little on the much debated North-East Line. I hope that with this new financing scheme, it would be possible to start work on the North-East Line immediately. Now, assuming that the new financing scheme still does not give the LTA enough comfort level, what about the other suggestions to make it feasible? One option discussed is that of higher fares for the North-East Line till a break-even point is reached. I believe that many will support this proposal. If the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Members of Parliament whose wards are affected can convince their residents, will the Minister agree? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add another suggestion. The LTA should also come up with a transparent method of calculating these added fares so that all can monitor it. The MPs can then persuade their residents more convincingly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Private Sector Involvement</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the rail system in general, I would also like to ask the Minister to hasten the implementation of the projects by letting the private sector build and operate some parts of the rail network. I am sure that as the new financing package is applicable to SMRT, it will also be applicable to other private operators. Thus, there will be other interested parties in the private sector. We must not have a situation whereby there is only one operator, the SMRT. We can then have a jump start with the implementation of several systems at one go. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by saying that this concept of partnership between the people, the Government and the service providers is a recipe for success. However, whether the partnership survives will depend not only on words but also on action. Given the political will, it can and must be a win-win situation for all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on item 6 on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WORLD CLASS LAND TRANSPORT SYSTEM</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the motion standing in the name of the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 484</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Sunday's edition of the Sunday Times contained two articles which I find useful in my discussion today on the White Paper. The first article entitled \"Singapore: The New Media Centre\" highlighted how Singapore is fast becoming a media hub. In a seeming contradiction of sorts, despite Western press reports of our stifling environment, the media industry, which is mainly a creative one, has found Singapore an ideal spot to locate itself. According to the report and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Contrary to some perceptions that Singapore is boring and stifling, staff in the satellite media industry find this more than adequate as a place to live and work. Ease of transport and telecommunications ranked highest among the good points cited.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, day in and day out, international transport and communications feature prominently in major international investment decisions. Therefore, this White Paper is timely. It serves not only to inform Singaporeans of our grand designs for our land transport system, it will also have an impact in international boardrooms where major overseas investment decisions are being made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second article is on the visit by Mr Tony Blair, Leader of the Opposition in the British Parliament. The article implied that Britain has a great deal to learn from Singapore. It features some of the recipes which have made Singapore what it is today. Implicit in this article is our hard-nosed approach to solving problems. There is a price to pay for good, strong government, both to the people as well as the party which remains or wants to be in power. It is in this area which we have excelled, in that no matter how difficult the solution, as long as it is necessary, the public can expect bitter medicine. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a country like Singapore where we do not have any natural resources to rely upon, the decisions that the Government has to make in order to ensure our survival in this competitive world are often hard-hitting but crucial, and certainly not popular by any means. And it is this conviction that unpopular policies are good for Singapore and Singaporeans as a whole that has indeed pushed us with a political will and grit unparalleled anywhere else in the world. I think even \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 485</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hard-core critics of ours have grudgingly admitted or realised that there is something to be learnt from Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is with alarm that I read in the White Paper of a major shift of what I consider a sound principle. This is a change in the definition of \"operating cost\". Our current position in all infrastructure projects, except for housing, health and education, is that revenue must not only cover operating cost but include accumulating enough reserves to replace the operating assets. This is a very sound principle indeed. Whether it is for water, electricity, gas or telecommunication services infrastructure, we have always practised the principle of not only covering operational costs but ensuring sufficient reserves are accumulated for future replacement of the capital assets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To justify the cost of extending the MRT network, the White Paper is now proposing that the Government will pay for the replacement cost but less current depreciation of the original assets for a new set of operating assets in the future, and the current operator need only recover the historical cost. This is a substantial departure from the Government's principle that once it has paid for the initial capital cost of the project, no further financial help will be granted as the project must be able to continue indefinitely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this change, we are disguising the fact that there is a subsidy in the MRT system. By so doing, the Government is in effect repeating the fatal mistake of major cities in the developed countries where subsidising of rail and public transportation systems has resulted in significant losses and increasing subsidy and mounting government deficits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This change also begs the question of imposing on a future government the burden of paying for the replacement of assets. We cannot assume that the government of the day will have sufficient surpluses accumulated to do so. There is also the question of the control of reserves by the Elected President. Can a future government draw upon the reserves of today's government which \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 486</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> makes this promise? On the other hand, if money is set aside by the present Government, then it is the present cohort of users who is paying for the replacement of future assets as the Government must then ensure that there are budget surpluses to do so. The Minister may like to explain how this process of committing a future government may be achieved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the North-East Line is too costly to build or not financially viable, then there are clearly two options. We either delay the project or increase the fares to generate sufficient revenue. Both these measures have political repercussions. But the cost of proceeding with the project on the new financing principle has even wider repercussions which will have a profound effect on how Singapore is governed. Even today, one can understand why SBS is asking for this principle to be applied to them. Quite rightly so, as new assets are almost always replaced at a higher cost. What about the taxi operator or owner? His taxi, seven years down the road, is invariably going to cost more than his current taxi. Is the Government going to subsidise him seven years down the road when he replaces his taxi over the current cost? Since taxis are now recognised as part of our land transport system, should this same principle not apply? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond land transport, what about utilities? Should not the utility companies lower their charges to recover today's capital cost and leave the worry of financing a new power plant in the future to the government of the day? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a sensible solution is that fares must rise if our current principle is to be adhered to. We should then identify how this fare increase will affect commuters and then target our subsidy where it is needed and necessary. This may be done in the form of tax and other rebates, concessionary travel passes or other such schemes. In this way, the Government subsidy or support is directed where it is needed. And this has always been the principle of the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence is that those who can afford to pay will pay the full fare and our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 487</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> trains will continue to run perpetually. There will be no question mark on future asset replacement and the government of the day will not have to subsidise all and sundry on an across-the-board basis which this new financing scheme is really all about. Therefore, I strongly urge the Government to do a rethink on this very significant change in principle. It is a very tough call, but let us not short-change our people and solve a short-term problem with very long-term pain. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, the White Paper sets out an excellent plan on the integrated development of the land transport system in land scarce Singapore. It addresses both the needs of the car owners and the non-car owners. It is inevitable that a small island like Singapore, land transportation has to be well-managed to maximise the use of the limited land. I am glad that the Government has stated clearly in the White Paper that it believes that the MRT/LRT system will be the backbone of the public transport system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also revised the financing framework for the replacement assets to make it more operationally viable to operate the MRT line. This move by the Government shows that it is committed to accelerating the construction of the North-Eastern line. The delay in the construction of the North-Eastern line has several implications both socially and financially for those in the North-Eastern corridor. I believe that the conditions are right for an announcement on the North-Eastern line. The need is there. The Minister has visited the North-Eastern sector and has seen for himself the urgent need for an MRT line. Road congestion is the norm and bus journeys are long and involve multiple trips. The support is also there. My community leaders, residents and I support any move to build the North-East line as soon as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, operational viability is within reach with this new financing formula. Whatever there is left that is required to cross the finishing line, my grassroots \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 488</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> leaders and I would be happy to work with the Ministry to cross the finishing line. We await with abated breath the good news on the North-Eastern line from the Minister. We hope that we would not be disappointed. Even if the construction of the North-Eastern MRT line were to commence shortly, its completion will take several years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has spelled out several measures in improving the transport system in the interim. Though wide-ranging, there is one important source of traffic congestion that has not been addressed by the White Paper, ie, the occupation of road lanes in major roads by contractors, statutory boards and even Government bodies which are involved in the laying of pipes, cables and other similar types of work. The Government can spend millions or even billions of dollars in carrying out the measures in the White Paper, but these measures can come to nought and their beneficial effects nullified by the occupation of road lanes during road works of this nature. A good example is the section of Lornie Road leading from Farrer Road to Upper Thomson Road. The pipes there are not only long but have been there equally long. I have lost count of the number of months it has been there. I can understand that there is a need to do certain essential work, but it is very difficult to understand why there is a need to leave the pipes there for such an extended period. Although I am certain that it is not because it is cheaper to use the road as a storage space, it might be wrongly perceived by the public that this is so. There is a need for entities or departments doing such work to have a responsibility to the public. As if this was not bad enough, they have commenced work on the other side of the road so that drivers driving along Lornie Road can now have the unenviable luxury of enjoying traffic jams on the way to work and on the way home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all road users pay for the use of roads through road taxes, COEs, petrol taxes, it does appear fair that the same principle should apply to everyone, including statutory bodies or departments that occupy road lanes for an extended period \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 489</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of time. The LTA should consider levying a charge for the use of the roads and impose a penalty for those who occupy road lanes for unnecessarily long periods. Everyone who uses the roads must exercise responsibility and it will be difficult to justify making exemptions. By applying a financial disincentive on road usage by these entities, it may help them to be more aware of the need to minimise road congestion. If we want Singapore to have a world class transport system, everyone must play a part. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, the White Paper is an excellent qualitative document setting out the future corporate vision on land transport. But having said that, I must present to the House candidly the feedback that I have received from my grassroots leaders, residents, trade unionists and other people known to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper has not made a significant impact on the general public. There is neither too much praise, nor is there too much of an adverse reaction. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the plus side, people, especially those living along the proposed North-East MRT line as well as other public transport users are very relieved that the Government has revised its definition of operating costs, so that the bulk of the asset replacement would be borne by the Government. It has been stated in the White Paper that for the existing North-South/East-West lines, the operator's share of the replacement cost will be $1.6 billion. Assuming a historical asset inflation of 5%, the balance cost of $5.3 billion would be borne by the Government. This revision to the basis of charging and breaking even will moderate fare increases. Had this not been done, the full replacement cost would have effected an immediate fare increase of 30 cents across the board. Had that 30 cents increase come about, it would have caused too much of a thunderstorm - which we cannot afford as we approach the \"harvest\" season. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the minus side, I have, as expected, or as is usual, received more feedback. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 490</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> First, it is said that the vision set out in the White Paper would be achieved in 10 to 15 years. Unfortunately, many Singaporeans find this far too long a period to wait. It translates into three to four elections before the vision is accomplished. Generally speaking, Singaporeans are impatient. Maybe it is because of our hectic pace of life or maybe because many of us had little choice but to pay hefty sums of money to get that elusive and expensive COE so that we could have a certain level of comfort and an uninterrupted journey from home to our destination. A car in Singapore is not a nice-to-have item but really a need-to-have item today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans had little choice on deciding whether or not to buy a car and so they are prepared to stretch themselves and pay a big price for COEs and cars because our public transportation system is not effectively integrated. The conclusion segment of the Executive Summary of the White Paper says, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We must start solving tomorrow's transport problems today.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very wise statement indeed. But had we started doing this effectively, say, 10 to 15 years ago to provide a more effective integrated public transport system, then we would have solved many of today's public transport problems yesterday. And this is what the typical Singaporean is saying. Let me quote a comment in today's Straits Times, and I quote Clement Chua, a company executive: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If door-to-door public transport really materialises, then I won't really need to drive a car.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at Hong Kong. They have a very effective integrated public transport system which includes the MTR, buses, mini-buses, taxis and even ferries. Their inter-connectivity points are very well planned. The all-weather sky bridges may not be aesthetically good, but functional, and the planning and coordination to co-locate bus stops with MTR stations, and key building complexes are superior to our own integration efforts so far. Our integration efforts were not well coordinated overall by any one single agency. The MRTC decides where to put their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 491</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> stations, and the PWD decides where to build the roads, and the bus operators decided where to locate their bus-stops. It is like the story of the seven blind men describing how an elephant looks like. The poor Transit Link Pte Ltd is possibly caught between these giant agencies who are pulling in different directions. It is certainly a sigh of relief, though 10 to 15 years too late, that the LTA has been formed to manage the agencies under one roof. Well, it is better late than never. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, the Government did well to address the problem of road congestion in the Central Business District (CBD) by introducing a string of measures, 10, 15, 20 years ago. These included the ALS (which was introduced, I think, 20 years ago), and others like PARF, ARF and so on. But, in my opinion, the integration of the public transport system was not addressed as adequately as the road congestion problem in CBD. The MRT trains started to roll in November 1987. Had we visualised and implemented a comprehensive, integrated public transport system before the first MRT trains rolled, we would not have needed a Vehicle Quota System (VQS) or a tender system like the COEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be argued that a Vehicle Quota System was necessary because more Singaporeans are wealthier and therefore they had generated a greater demand for cars. While Singaporeans are more wealthier than before, very few Singaporeans can actually pay cash for new cars and COEs. Many of those who buy cars go to the bank for a loan. We read in the papers very often that the quantum of personal loans had increased significantly in the past few years. Last night, at a dinner, a prominent banker confirmed that in his own market segment, which is quite large, the personal savings of Singaporeans had reduced very much because they have either a hefty car or housing loan to pay up. It is the banking industry that benefits from increased loans and the Government, inevitably, accumulates a budget surplus from COEs. But the perceivably wealthier Singaporean who has some reasons for needing to own a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 492</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> car is in effect an urban poor after buying a car. So on hindsight, effective integration of the public transport system could have been yesterday's answer to today's and tomorrow's problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the White Paper spells out a comprehensive plan to integrate the public transportation system. I hope that this is done fast, and I urge the Government to make it so convenient and so affordable that Singaporeans who drive just to work and back home would be made to look like fools who want to part with their money or fools who want to slog and pay their hefty car loan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I met an old classmate of mine recently. He had read the White Paper and he jokingly, or maybe cynically, made a remark on an acronym used in the White Paper. He was referring to SURS. He said that he had searched the main report quite thoroughly and could not find out what the acronym SURS stood for. So he said, and I quote, \"It is possibly an abbreviation for all the surcharges that would come with the world class land transport system.\" This remark could either be taken as a snipe or as a reflection of the pinch that our society feels due to our over-zealous pursuit of a free market economy. Anyway, to complete my little anecdote, I must add that I went back to check the White Paper and true enough, I could not find the full wording for SURS in the main report. It is not in Chapter 4, but I managed to find it in the Executive Summary where it says that SURS stands for Singapore Underground Road System. So I called my classmate the next day to tell him about it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the way the Government puts forth its policies, especially sensitive policies, such as the land transport system, is important. Otherwise, very often the good intentions of transport policies are misunderstood and misinterpreted. A case in point is the announcement that the commuters on the proposed North-East MRT line have to pay more for the line because of the lower usage. According to reports, the usage, if the line is completed by the year 2002, is about 240,000 compared to 709,000 on the existing lines. For the North-East line \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this works out to about 20% of the total MRT commuters, assuming today's commuter size. When the announcement of the fares was made by the Ministry, it did not just upset those 20% of the commuters or, say, 20% of Singaporeans, who live mainly along the North-East line. It upset almost everyone. Even those who may never ever take the North-East line found it fashionable, as always, to criticise this over a cup of coffee with friends. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the bus transport operators, SBS and Trans-Island, are required contractually to operate both profitable and not-so-profitable bus routes so that Singaporeans living in the remotely linked areas can still have access to the buses. But I believe that passengers pay more or less the same rates as those using the profitable bus routes. So, many Singaporeans, especially those living in the North-East line, thought that the rule for the bus operators should apply to the MRT operator. But perhaps this is not a `light to light' comparison because the assets or capital costs for MRT are so much higher. If we apply the present rule for the bus operators to the MRT operator, the rate of increase of MRT fares could be more significant across the board. Perhaps, it could be even 30 cents or more across the board. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given this scenario, perhaps one suggested approach, on hindsight, that should perhaps have been taken when the announcement on fares for the North-East line was made, is that the Ministry could have put two options forward to the people: One is to follow the bus operator's mechanism of cross-subsidy from the profitable routes to the less profitable routes, and the second option is to make the North-East line, as announced, to pay more. If that had been the case, perhaps 80% of the MRT commuters would have possibly said that making people pay for usage of their own lines is better and that the North-East line commuters should pay for the cost of their own line. This may sound selfish but it is a natural human reaction. Of course, I concede that some others could have said either way the Government should pay for it. Now, after the `storm', the Government has now \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 494</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> agreed to pay for the asset replacement cost. But it appears somewhat reactionary. I would like to urge the Ministry to rally its machinery of administrative service bureaucrats to better package transport policies so that the policies are prudent and yet palatable to Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I like to now move on to the demand management of private cars and, in particular, to the Area Licensing Scheme (ALS). The ALS was first introduced in 1975 and has been effective in controlling congestion in the CBD, even though the vehicle population has more than doubled. While I fully agree that the morning and evening ALS has been effective, I think that the whole day ALS, introduced in 1994, appears to be ineffective. According to the White Paper, the whole day ALS only helped to reduce the traffic volume in the CBD by only 9.3%, less than 10%. Even if we assume an annual increase of 3% in vehicle population, the reduction in traffic in the CBD during the off-peak period, though has plateaued, is not too significant. Somehow, the end result is that the extra collection of ALS fees inevitably adds up to the budget surpluses, and this somewhat agitates the car owners and others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem with the whole day ALS. I refer to Chart 5 in the White Paper. While the traffic during the off-peak periods, as I said, plateaued a little, more cars are coming into the CBD during both the morning and evening peak periods. This increase in the peak periods seems to defeat the whole objective of the ALS scheme which was very effective in the last 20 years in cutting down the traffic during the peak periods. And I personally experience this after the implementation in 1994. I find it more difficult to get to work or get home. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there is a counter argument. The ALS fee for the peak period is $3 and the off-peak is $2. So it is possible to argue that because it is only a marginal difference of $1 for the peak period, it is not sufficient to deter motorists from entering the CBD during the peak period. I do not think that we should increase the ALS fee for the peak period. Perhaps the off-peak rate of $2 should be reduced to $1 or be removed completely. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 495</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparation for the ERP, the trends in the peak and off-peak traffic pattern in the CBD would allow the policy makers to determine road pricing at different times of the day at different locations. We must be very careful in the way that we determine prices when ERP is implemented. Already there are symptoms in the White Paper that perhaps the ERP is the world's first system and that there would be limitations. The White Paper goes on to say that the amount charged for using the road space will not be very precise, and that we should not wait indefinitely for an ideal system to evolve. I am very concerned that this reflects a typical bureaucratic thinking. As I have mentioned earlier, we must not create more problems, especially political problems by introducing ERP. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, has already pointed out in November last year that the ERP could be more of a political problem than the present Vehicle Quota System. The car owners pay a one-off COE which perhaps agitates them for a year or two, after which it gradually fades away from memory until it is time to buy another car. But with the ERP, the car owner would have to worry about paying and paying every day. So the agitation and the possible political problems would be magnified. So we should study the ERP implementation much more carefully. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to say that the White Paper is a landmark document. I want to reiterate that the plans to integrate the public transport system be accelerated and at least 80% be completed within the next five years. The Government must not be too rigid in its free market policy concept in the case of public transportation. It may be appropriate for me at this juncture to quote Dr Charles Handy, a well-known management philosopher and guru, from his book \"The Age of Unreason\": \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Governments, having discovered that the market, the mechanism of choice, liberates initiative and penalises inefficiency, are tempted to leave all to self-regulating choice. That would be dangerous. Markets do not look much beyond tomorrow, or at least next \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 496</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> year. Markets are inherently selfish, disinclined to make investments whose outcomes cannot be predicted or whose benefits cannot be claimed in advance.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I urge our Government to spend much more of our budget surpluses on public transportation because of our limited land, unlike what Mr Chng has said. The Government must make the land transport system so good and so affordable that the desire and the propensity to own a car would be drastically diminished not in the long term but in the short term. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, this White Paper can be said to be a prelude to the full implementation of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system by the Government. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, let me deal with the question of private cars. The Government has always been using the method of increasing the burden of car owners to control and attempt to solve the land transport problem. From the road tax increases and the Additional Registration Fees (ARF) in the initial stages to the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) today, the Government has always been using the price mechanism to control the increase in car population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that car buyers have to pay very much more to own cars, and Singapore is still faced with the problem of traffic congestion. So, the Government is going to introduce the ERP system to discourage people from using their cars by the collection of toll. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper states that the ERP system will make our main roads and expressways free flowing. However, if we take the experimental ECP system in the East Coast Parkway as an example, we will notice that this system can only result in more congestion in the roads around the vicinity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to solve the problem of congestion along the other roads where ERP is not implemented, it would be necessary to extend the ERP system to cover the other roads as well. In the end, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 497</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> every road in Singapore will be subjected to ERP. Moreover, in order that the toll system would be effective, and motorists would be discouraged from using certain roads, would it not be necessary to increase the toll charges again and again? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows that once the ERP system is fully implemented, not only car owners will have to pay more, the cost of goods transport will increase, business cost will increase, and these increases will be passed on to the consumers and there is no way the poor people can escape from this kind of increases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, in spite of the high cost, are more and more people buying cars? As a matter of fact, most people own cars because of the convenience they offer and the present public transport system is not convenient enough. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have a good public transport system, people do not have to waste too much time waiting for buses and changing buses to get to their destinations, like the London or Paris underground tube systems where train stations are within walking distance and easily accessible to the commuters, then I believe most Singaporeans will not want to own cars, and subject themselves to extra financial burden. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to improve the overall public transport system and cut down the need for car ownership is the basic solution. But what the Government has done is, on the one hand, it wants car owners to pay more, to make money out of them, and on the other hand, it is dragging its feet in improving public transport system, and even wanting to involve the people in cost-sharing. The Government wants the private companies to operate the public transport system, and then asks the people to pay more to ensure the profits of these private companies. Is this reasonable? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper states that the public transport operators should \"extract efficiency dividends within the service standards and fare structure approved by the Public Transport Council\". The people have to pay not only the increased fares to cover the rising cost of providing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 498</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> public transport, but also to ensure that the operators, who monopolise the market, get their reasonable profits. This kind of cost-sharing is very unfair to the poor people in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the Workers' Party programme, we have suggested the establishment of a National Transport Enterprise to take over the operation of buses and the MRT. This enterprise will ensure proper coordination between MRT and bus services to avoid duplication and to facilitate the use of a common farecard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, this National Transport Enterprise should not be profit-oriented. It should aim just to break even in its operation, and should plough back all the benefits derived from increased efficiency and productivity to the commuters to maintain low fares. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 59 of the White Paper, it is stated \"the public's willingness to pay for the services is an important indication that they value the service.\" It also states \"If the bus and train companies cannot receive the additional costs of providing the better service, they will not find it viable to provide it.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to achieve a \"world class\" public transport system as stated in the White Paper, based on this kind of principle, then the people of Singapore also have to pay a \"world class\" fare for their public transport. I think the people would then have to puff themselves up to their own cost in order to satisfy the vanity of the Government of achieving a \"World Class Land Transport System\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also states: \"Public transport projects must at least recover operating cost. The Government will fund the capital cost of the projects, but the project must at least break even on its operating expenditures.\" Of course, it will be even better if it can make profit immediately. The Government will allocate funds to develop the so-called World Class Transport System only under this principle. I think this is just feeding on illusions. It may well be just wishful thinking for the ordinary folks. The North-East MRT line is a clear example. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 499</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The North-East line was originally scheduled as Phase 3 of the MRT system. As early as 1988, during the campaign for the General Election, the then Minister for Communications, Dr Yeo Ning Hong was reported by the Straits Times, on 31st August 1988, as saying that soil testing for the North-East line would begin. He also said that the North-East line would be the third phase of the entire MRT project and would be one of the main trunk lines in the MRT system. Yet, seven years later, this North-East line is nowhere in sight. The Government is repeatedly delaying the construction. The main reasons are as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In recent years, the Government has been concentrating on the development of the Woodlands and Chua Chu Kang housing estates, thus neglecting the development of the areas along the North-East line. For example, they built a total of 44,297 units of HDB flats in Woodlands and Chua Chu Kang housing estates during the period between 1990 and 1995/96. But in Hougang and Serangoon housing estates, only 15,577 units were built during the same period. Today, the Government is using the excuse that there is inadequate passenger-load for the North-East line and therefore this is not the right time to build it. I think this is the result of imbalance in the Government's development of public housing. Consequently, the residents in the north-eastern part of the island are unable to enjoy the convenience of a MRT line. As such, the Government should not push the responsibility to the people and tell them that if they want to have the North-East line earlier, they would have to pay higher fares to cover the losses by bringing forward the construction date. We must remember that the reason why operating cost of the North-East line cannot break even is that the Government has neglected the development of the areas along the North-East line. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The North-East line was originally scheduled to be the third phase of the entire MRT project. But now, the Government is calling it an \"extension line\". If the stretch of MRT line from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 500</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Jurong East to Chua Chu Kang is not an extension line, then how can the North-East line be an extension line? I think the Government is forcing itself to change the description of the North-East line from the original Phase 3 of the national MRT project to that of an extension line for the following reasons: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) By calling it an extension line, the Government can use different standards to evaluate the North-East line, and may even ask the people to share the cost; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Government knows that the people of Singapore want to improve the MRT system and so it is using the North-East line as an excuse to make the people pay higher fares in order that the MRTC can make more money and become a listed company sooner, so that the Government will no longer have to care for them. So if the MRTC wants to raise the fares, they can use the excuse that there is not enough passenger-load on the North-East line and make the North-East line the victim. The Government must not forget that the MRTC had made an after-tax profit of $100 million in the financial year 1994/95 alone, before transferring it to the reserves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, looking at this White Paper on \"A World Class Land Transport System\" and from the way the Government is shifting its responsibility in building the North-East line, I finally understand why it is emphasized in the \"Conclusion\" section of this White Paper that to be able to have this \"world class\" land transport system, more importantly, the cooperation, support and understanding of the people of Singapore are necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the Government's intention is that the people must understand that in order to have a \"world class\" system, they must be prepared to pay \"world class\" fares. At the same time, the Government also wants the people of Singapore to support the COE system and the ERP system, ie, buy more cars, use more cars, so that the Government would have more money pouring in. The Government also wants the people to cooperate to realize a world class transport system. So no matter how \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 501</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> heavy the burden of your fares may be, it shall be deemed to be affordable. At the General Election, you must elect a government that can make more money from the people. This is perhaps the true meaning of this White Paper on \"A World Class Land Transport System\"! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land transport is one of the key bread and butter issues facing Singaporeans. For this reason, the Feedback Unit has organised several feedback dialogue sessions on land transport, including three dialogue sessions between December 1994 and January 1995 and the last one, just a few days ago, on 15th January 1996. The latest dialogue session focused on the White Paper on \"A World Class Land Transport System\". The notes of the dialogue session had been sent to the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the three dialogue sessions in December 1994 and January 1995 and other feedback inputs, it appears that the focus of attention on land transport has shifted from \"car ownership\" to \"public transport\". Specifically, dialogue participants agreed that the only solution is \"not more cars but better public transport because of Singapore's land scarcity\". They also agreed on the need for the Government to control car ownership and usage so as to maintain a free-flowing road system. However, participants wanted the public transport system to be improved. They emphasised that public transport services should be reliable, convenient and affordable. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.20 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The participants of the latest dialogue session on 15th January this year raised similar points but the White Paper provided a more focused discussion. The following points were made: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The participants generally welcomed the proposals in the White Paper. But they observed that many Singaporeans were keen to understand how the proposals in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 502</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the White Paper would affect them individually, especially on the mode of transport available to them and its cost. Nevertheless, some participants felt that the concept of a world class land transport system might be too abstract for the man-in-the-street to relate to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) One major concern among grassroots leaders, unionists and student leaders was whether the proposed world class land transport system would lead to \"world class\" prices. They were also concerned about the impact of the Electronic Road Pricing on taxi fares. If the road pricing cost is passed on to taxi commuters, the lower income group would no longer be able to afford to take a taxi even on special occasions or during an emergency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) On service standards, they reiterated the same points of previous dialogue participants that public transport should be reliable, convenient, comfortable and affordable. It should not only satisfy the demands of regular commuters, but also aim to attract car owners to use the service. They felt strongly that in the current bus services, there was much room for improvement, and that the bus companies were not doing enough. For example, buses are always crowded during peak hours; the frequency of buses in outlying areas, for example, Jurong and Loyang industrial estates, is poor and too many transfers need to be made. They requested for more express bus services to the city and public housing estates. They also suggested that the increase in bus fares should be on a percentage basis, instead of rounding up to 5 or 10 cents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Some professionals and academics in the dialogue session felt that cargo transport and storage needs should be taken into account in planning for a world class transport system, in order to cut down the need for cargo transport across the island. There could be integrated land-use planning for the ports, factories and warehouses. Other participants also suggested that the Government could design \"walking towns\" where the main amenities, like markets and schools, are sited within walking distance, for example, 500 metre radius, without the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 503</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> need for roads. As for private transport, there were some arguments among these professionals whether control measures on car usage could replace control measures on car ownership. These are the feedback we collected in the last session. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my personal view is that the two specific concerns raised by unionists and grassroots leaders on the increase in fares and prices and the standard of public transport services need special attention from the Government. They reflect the views of the man-in-the-street. The ordinary citizens or so-called \" \" (lao bai xing) will not be able to relate to a world class transport system in 10-15 years' time when they have to face fare increases within one or two years, and live with the existing inadequacies and inconveniences of the public transport system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a policy proposal should not only be correct, it should also be accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, fare increases are inevitable because public transport is a labour-intensive service. Manpower cost accounts for 50% of the operating cost of bus companies. Also, new vehicles, trains and equipment will cost more in the future. Increase in productivity, efficiency and the economy of scale perhaps can only moderate the quantum of increases. I agree with the first financial principle that fares must be realistic and revised periodically to adjust for justifiable cost increases. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) should learn the lesson of the sudden increases of MRT and bus fares in October/November 1990. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fare increases will perhaps be more acceptable if there are improvements in the quality of public transport services. The LTA should consider setting up operation performance standards for each of the differentiated services so that we can ascertain whether the public transport services have really improved 10-15 years later. I emphasise the word \"operation\" standards and not \"design\" standards. One perception is that bus companies are profit-oriented and not service-oriented and these companies have accumulated \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 504</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> huge profits. Although it was clarified in one dialogue session that only one-third of the bus routes were profitable, another one-third just achieved break-even and the rest were operating at a loss, and that the rate of return on capital on buses was low (only about 4.5%), the people remain sceptical. They are unhappy with the present duopoly situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One repeated suggestion is that a few more bus companies should be allowed to operate so that competition will improve service standards and moderate fare increases. I believe Dr Vasoo has raised this recently. However, this suggestion of more competition should be balanced against the benefit of the economy of scale. The White Paper has warned of the danger of a free-for-all bus competition, as experienced in Britain, and it had endorsed the present duopolistic bus industry structure as a sound one (this is in page 44). I find the reasoning not very convincing. Perhaps the Minister should respond to this issue of greater competition again in the context of the White Paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second financial principle is that the services must at least recover operating cost. With regard to operating cost, some specific questions need to be clarified: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Should the depreciation rate of public transport equipment be capped at a certain level, say, for example, not exceeding the percentage increase of CPI? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Should the bus and public transport operators be reimbursed for the revenue loss from concession fares? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Is the dividend on SBS shares included in the operating cost? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the most significant change is the third financial principle on asset replacement. The White Paper proposes that the second set of operating assets will be financed by fare revenue covering only the historical cost of the first set of operating assets, while the Government co-finances the balance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of this proposal are that fare increases can be moderated and that MRT extension or LRT may be built earlier. However, the replacement cost principle \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 505</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> involves inter-generation transfer of assets. One characteristic of social overheads, including infrastructures like the public transport system, is its longevity, lasting more than one generation. The questions are: which generation should pay for it, and who in the generation, taxpayers or users, should pay for it? The White Paper says in page 60: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Each generation should pay for the services and assets it consumes.' This is fine, but the problem is that assets are not consumed within one generation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not comfortable with this particular principle. The proposed third financial principle implies that we are committing now the future government and future taxpayers. Can the Minister explain this principle in greater detail so as to convince us and the people that the proposed principle is fairer, as mentioned in the White Paper? And fairer to whom? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A related question is: what is the reason that we cannot finance part of the asset replacement cost by borrowing? In page 60 of the White Paper, it is mentioned that we should not finance projects through excessive borrowing. I am not talking about excessive borrowing, but some borrowing should be considered. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should be cautious about this asset replacement principle, the third principle. Once implemented, taxis and bus companies, indeed all transport operators, will request for a similar replacement financing principle. Moreover, should all future expansion and investment on port, airport, telecommunication, public utilities and other infrastructures follow the same replacement financing policy? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I have read the White Paper and I must say that I support the motion before the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is one of a series of White Papers that we have received over the last few years, explaining the rationale behind Government policy. As an ordinary citizen, may I thank the Minister for having given us this opportunity to examine the basis of Government policy rather than just imposing it upon us. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 506</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at this White Paper, it is clearly very well thought out. It is clearly very well written in the tradition of all the White Papers that we have received. May I, however, concentrate on one little area here. Some people have expressed the hope that with the introduction of electronic road pricing, COEs will disappear. But I think it is clear from listening to the Minister and from reading the White Paper that that is not going to be the case. ERP is there to curb road usage. COEs are there to control supply. The two apparently will co-exist. And this means that motorists in Singapore will have to put up with the inevitability of both high car prices as well as the increased cost of usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should make a distinction between three things which are not entirely clear from the White Paper, the distinction between supply, demand and allocation. When we talk about using COEs as a means of curbing demand, may I suggest that this is not entirely accurate. COEs do not curb demand. They cap the supply. The demand is there because people desire cars. And we cannot control that desire by imposing an arbitrary limit on the number of COEs. What we do is that we cap the supply. And because the supply is capped and the demand is there, the prices shoot up. When the White Paper says that COEs are a way of curbing demand, I think we should be very careful about looking at that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think most people in Singapore, having thought about the matter, accept that we cannot keep on building roads and putting cars on the roads because eventually we are just going to run out of physical space. I think that is accepted by all thinking Singaporeans. So it is not a question of convincing people to accept COEs as a means of limiting supply. I think much of the unhappiness with the COE system is not with the principle of limiting supply, but the question of how the COEs are allocated. How do we allocate the COEs, and not whether or not we should have COEs? That is what I think bothers a lot of people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlling COEs does not mean reducing desire. The problem is that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> whole COE scheme is economically rational. It is efficient. But it takes no account of the emotional aspect of the problem. The problem is that the car is not just a utilitarian vehicle to get us from point A to point B. For many people, it is, in fact, a visible symbol of a person's material success. In a materialistic society like ours, I think the desire for this kind of tangible symbolism is very strong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think we can significantly reduce the desire for cars without fundamentally changing the basis of our society, and it is going to take a generation or more. And since we cannot fundamentally change the desire for material icons, as it were, I think we must accept that no matter what we do with public transport, no matter how efficient it is, there will always be that demand for the car for the sake of having a car, not just as a means of transport. Because people will want the car to show that they have arrived, not just any old car. They will want a car with a luxury name. Singapore must be the only place in the world where Mercedes Benz outsells Toyota. It is a testimony either to our affluence or to our collective stupidity. But there it is. We have a very, very odd situation here because of a very strong desire to have these material things. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the supply of COEs must be limited, the question is whether or not any other way can be found to allocate the COEs. When I first started working many years ago, a no-frill entry level car cost about 10 times my monthly salary. A young graduate who starts working nowadays will be hard put to find a motorised tin can at 10 times his salary. He just cannot afford it. I have heard many young graduates, many young people, express dissatisfaction and frustration at the fact that they can no longer afford these things, and they feel that somehow they have been treated unfairly and there is this sense of frustration. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we then give the people at the lower rungs of the earning ladder a decent chance to have a car? I think a useful analogy might perhaps be drawn as far as \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 508</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> public housing is concerned. In the case of housing, we have always had a public and a private sector. For a person who cannot afford the very high prices that prevail in the private sector, he has the option of going to the public sector, where allocation is done not solely on the basis of market forces but by balloting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the White Paper, if we read pages 31 and 32, the question of balloting for COEs is dismissed rather glibly in just two very brief paragraphs. It says on page 31: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Of course, it is possible to allocate a fixed supply of COEs to lucky recipients which are below the market clearing price, as some have suggested, by way of a ballot.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At page 32, it says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Even this will not increase the number of COEs or the number of Singaporeans who can obtain COEs. Furthermore, this will be unfair to the many Singaporeans not lucky enough to receive an under priced COE.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I suggest that this actually misses the point. It is not a question of whether we can increase the number of COEs, but whether we can increase what people perceive to be the fairness of the system. I am not suggesting at any time that we should go for a total ballot system, ballot the whole lot, because obviously it would be unfair. But is it possible to look into a public and private system, just like for public housing, and take a proportion of the lower end COEs and allocate these by ballot? After all, the Minister has said that the ratio will go up from 1:10 to 1:7. Therefore, there will be more COEs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know because I am not an economist and I do not have all the information whether this is in fact feasible. But to have it dismissed in two brief paragraphs down here and to leave it entirely to the market is, may I suggest, unsatisfactory. Because there are many people who feel that the present system is skewed towards the 5-figure per month group, and most Singaporeans are not in that group. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there will be long waits and no doubt there will be problems of implementation. But if that balloting system or quasi-balloting system is found to be unfeasible, at least let us know why it is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 509</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unfeasible. Do not just dismiss it out of hand like this. I think sometimes the Government treats Singaporeans as if they do not really have the capacity to understand these things. I think by and large, most Singaporeans are rational and they know that we cannot have everything - cheap cars, unlimited usage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economics is a hard and unsympathetic master. If we leave it entirely to the market to govern the allocation of COEs, what we are going to have is a situation where the prices will gallop off over the horizon and woe betide those who cannot keep up with it. And as long as the desire is there to have a car, the result is frustration, which may lead to disenchantment and may lead to a less committed younger segment. The key question I think is whether or not in this particular matter we can accept a little less economic rationality in the interest of greater social contentment. After all, the people on the lower rungs of the earning ladder are just as much stakeholders in Singapore Incorporated as those who are earning five figures a month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the White Paper before us is a well thought and well written piece of document, depicting the concept of a world class land transport system to usher Singapore into the new century. It describes the architecture of a world class land transport system comprising the following modes - the MRT, the LRT, buses, taxis and private vehicles - each serving the needs of the commuters based on their personal choices. It paints a picture of seamless integration between the various modes of land transportation. This goal of a world class land transport system is a worthy one for us to pursue as this is a vision with universal appeal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe most Singaporeans will support this vision of the White Paper. Therefore, not unexpectedly, most of the concerns expressed by the general public on the White Paper centre around the financial framework under which this land transport system will be built and brought \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> into being. Here, Sir, I find the White Paper too intent in its agenda to drive home the message that the user must pay for the use of the system. To drive home this message, it lays down three principles of cost recovery, namely, adjust fare regularly, cost recovery and asset replacement. Frankly speaking, I think there is basically only one principle, ie, cost recovery. I think most Singaporeans will accept this principle of cost recovery for operation. The other two principles, for instance, asset replacement and fare adjustment, are mechanisms to achieve the objective and can be subsumed under the simple basis of operating with sufficient fare adjustment to support cost recovery. Therefore, I find the financial principle proposed in the White Paper as simply the following. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Government will build the transport infrastructure such as roads, MRT and LRT. Secondly, the public transport operators are to recover the cost of operation as well as the depreciation of current assets. These are very sound fundamental principles to build and sustain a world class land transport system, and I support them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these fundamental principles, I would like to make the following observations regarding the White Paper. As I said earlier, the White Paper is too focused on reiterating the obvious and not sufficient on specifics. For instance, I believe all of us would agree that the land transport system would mean a public transport system which ultimately would come down to a rail transport system. In the White Paper, three cities were quoted. London started their rail system in 1863, which means 131 years ago; Paris 94 years ago; Tokyo 67 years ago; and Singapore MRT seven years ago. The White Paper implies that Singaporeans should be patient and wait for a better land transport system because ours is still very new. From my point of view, I believe that since we actually started off quite late, there should indeed be a sense of urgency for us to build a comparable system in the shortest possible time. Singapore has become a developed country in a short span of 30 years. Singaporeans are used to moving fast and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> I think the LTA should lay down in the White Paper a time-table showing the various milestones to achieve this vision of a world class land transport system. I hope that once Parliament endorses the principle behind this White Paper, the LTA should remedy this shortcoming. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am suggesting that to bring us closer to this vision of a world class land transport system, the LTA should embark on a non-stop, maybe 10 years, building programme instead of the present approach in which we have to evaluate segment by segment and whether the North-East line is financially viable or not. In fact, I believe we have already lost some very good years since the early 1970s debating whether or not to proceed with the MRT in the first place. Besides delaying Singaporeans' enjoyment of a better land transport system, delaying in the construction has also increased the cost of construction significantly. The North-South/East-West lines cost us $5 billion. The Woodlands link costs us $1.3 billion, giving us a total of $6.3 billion in construction cost. The yet-to-be-built North-East line will cost us $5 billion. All these figures are quoted from the White Paper. So let us assume that we had built the North-East line at the same time with the North-South and the East-West lines. Using the rule of thumb and my simple ruler, I would saythat it probably would cost us between $3 billion and $3.5 billion. So by building the North-East line, say, a few years down the road, it would increase by $1 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a lot of money. This amount of money would have covered the interest cost, opportunity cost, or maybe the cost of running the North-East line at a loss for several years. So I believe we should ask the question whether it would have been better off for Singaporeans to build the line earlier or build the line later; or did Singaporeans now have to pay a bill close to $1 billion just to learn a very simple economic lesson? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, building a world class land transport system comprising the MRT, the LRT and the road networks is going to cost us a lot of money. But, fortunately for us, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 512</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Government seems to have the money because the White Paper never touched on how we would derive the money to pay for it. I believe we have the money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not build the system today, or a few years down the road, it would mean that we would have passed the money down to a future generation. If we build the system, what we have passed down would be a world class land transport infrastructure. Between the two, most of us Singaporeans, present generation or future generation, would have chosen the latter option. Just like today's present day Londoners or New Yorkers, Parisians and Tokyoites, they are thankful to their forefathers for the foresight and vision and, on top of that, the ability to invest in their subway system so that today they could enjoy a very good land transport system. So I hope Singaporeans would also make the same choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper also emphasises the more intense development of housing and commercial properties above and around the MRT stations. It mentioned that the Hong Kong MRT offers some valuable lessons that the Singapore MRT could adopt. However, the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railroad Corporation ordinance specifically gives the Hong Kong MTR the right during the construction stage to develop properties above the stations. In practice, the Hong Kong MTR formed joint ventures with partners for these commercial developments and paid full market price for the sites. In Singapore, the MRTC is not similarly empowered. As a result, we have already lost some opportunities in not developing the property, for instance, around stations like the Orchard Station and others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in Singapore, property development is under the purview of HDB and URA. Although the White Paper encourages better commercial development around those sites, it did not elaborate on how the LTA would coordinate with these two organisations. This is the point that I find not too satisfactory. Indeed, there are merits to adopt the Hong Kong MTR model and maybe we should consider empowering the LTA to develop commercial property above \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the MRT stations as an integral part during the construction of future MRT lines. I am sure the Minister has already considered this proposal and would comment in his reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper is a comprehensive one touching on almost every aspect of land transport. I am happy to note that the LTA will be introducing the concept of virtual slip roads or left-turn arrows on red where motorists could turn left when the red signal is on. This is a small item, but I have spoken on this twice during previous budget debates. So I am very happy to note that the LTA has finally supported the idea. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by saying that the concepts in the White Paper are sound. In principle, I support them. When the concepts are implemented in the future, I believe Singaporeans would enjoy a world class land transport system befitting the aspirations of Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Opposition Member, I look at the White Paper in a slightly different light. Is the White Paper on \"A World Class Land Transport System\" an election ploy? I think partly it is, after all this is an election year. In my view, the White Paper shall surely become part of the PAP election strategy. This kind of election strategy is not new. We have seen it done before. In the 1988 General Elections, the Government came up with the vision of making Singapore a world class city and to achieve the Swiss standard of living in 1997. The PAP used that vision of achieving the Swiss standard of living in Singapore as its election manifesto in 1988. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To respond to what the Deputy Prime Minister has said, in yesterday's Straits Times, I read that the OECD has changed its mind and decided that Singapore is not a developed country after all. If we are not developed, I do not know whether we have reached the Swiss standard of living. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1991 General Election, the Government published its grand vision for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore in a book entitled The Next Lap. That book was again used by the PAP as its election platform in that general election. In this year's general election, I shall not be surprised at all if the PAP uses the proposals in the White Paper on a world class land transport system for its election purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the White Paper and I find it too general. No specific information such as when the North-East MRT line shall be built is given. Another matter is the ERP which concerns many motorists. The White Paper only says that the ERP shall be in operation in 1997, but it does not say how much it is going to cost motorists. I believe this concern has been expressed in correspondence in the press. With the ERP in place, usage of motor cars can be really expensive. The White Paper should have given some indication of the charges that shall be levied on motorists when the ERP is in place. If usage of roads is going to be jacked up, will the cost of motor cars become lower? The Minister should clarify on these points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which needs clarification is the term \"A World Class Transport System\". What does a world class transport system constitute? The White Paper says that it must provide commuters with highly efficient, comfortable and convenient rides in a free-flowing traffic. But in practical terms, what does it mean? What I want to know is at what level of infrastructural development of Singapore's transport system can it be said that Singapore has achieved a world class transport system. The White Paper gives plans of building a network of road systems involving the Singapore Underground Road System (SURS) and the MRT and LRT lines. How much of this vision as set out in the White Paper has to be completed before Singapore can be said to have a world class transport system? Is it half of the programme or is it fully? If the whole programme as laid out in the White Paper has to be completed before Singapore can be said to have a world class transport system, then I do not think that the 10-15 years' time-table mentioned in the White Paper is a realistic time frame. I think it would take longer than that. I would say at least 18 years or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> more. Perhaps the Minister can give us a time-table of completion dates of the road network, SURS, the Kallang and Northshore lines and the LRT system. I believe this has been requested for by the previous speaker. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the North-East line, the Minister has put all his cards very close to his chest. The White Paper also does not throw much light on it except that it is 20 km long. At this stage, perhaps it is a good time for the Minister to give more details about the North-East line. In particular, when will it be built and when is its expected completion date? What route it would take and the names of all the stations along the route. It is not me who wants the information. People who are living in the North-East corridor are the most interested people to know the answers. Now is as good a time as any for the Minister to give the answers, and I hope the Minister shall not disappoint them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to build a world class transport system. In fact, for motorists in this country, they deserve a world class road network system now, because they are paying not world class prices for their motorcars but super world class prices for them. What we pay for one car in Singapore can be used to purchase three equivalent capacity cars in America. The car prices in Singapore may be the highest, or if not the highest in the world. Motorists in Singapore can justly claim for a world class road network now. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the higher cost of motoring and the vast amounts of taxes collected from motorists, the Government should proceed to construct the SURS now and not drag its feet any longer. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one matter which appears unrelated, but I would like to bring it up with the Minister, and this concerns commuter facilities. I refer to the covered linkways from HDB flats to bus stops. In the LTA's implementation of its vision of a world class transport system, I would like to know who would pay for such linkways \ufffd the bus operators, the Government, or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the Town Councils? At the moment, my constituency is in an unhappy position where we have to pay wholly for such linkways, whereas the PAP wards pay only about 25% of the cost. All PAP constituencies get CIPC (Community Improvement Projects Committee) support funds of up to 75% of the cost of such community works. Can the Minister help to change this policy, at least in respect of only covered linkways connecting HDB flats to bus stops, so that Potong Pasir too can play its part in building a world class land transport system? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I noted is glaringly missing in the White Paper. This matter has been brought up by me in Parliament before, and that is, the request for construction of bicycle lanes on our roads. I think I shall be too ambitious if I ask the Minister to build bicycle lanes on all our roads, except the highways. I shall not do that, but what I want to ask the Minister is to start building bicycle lanes in all HDB estates, not only Potong Pasir. I am thinking of the children who love to cycle. Children must be protected and they should be given a safe place to enjoy their cycling. Of course, other people can also use those bicycle lanes to commute within the estate, such as going to the shops, market, and also to ride to the MRT stations. I think I am also not asking too much if cyclists take their bicycles to the MRT stations, they must find a sheltered place to put their bicycles. Therefore, perhaps I should also request the Minister in helping to construct bicycle sheds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It does not mean that because Singapore is affluent, we have to abandon the bicycle. I get this feeling when I read the White Paper. There were no provisions recommended in the White Paper for cyclists on our road network system. The bicycle is a good mode of transport. It is not only very cheap, but it does not take up much space on our roads and, more importantly, it is pollution-free and healthy. I wonder whether the Minister is willing to include bicycle lanes in HDB estates for a start, as part of its world class transport system programme. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr S. Chandra Das -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr S. Chandra Das (Cheng San GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if Mr Chiam thinks \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 517</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that this White Paper is an election document, I suggest that he uses some of the good ideas, which are put in the White Paper, during his election campaign. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans are a widely travelled lot and can clearly see and understand the transport problems faced in many countries, like Thailand, Taiwan and Japan, to mention a few. We have been a little fortunate because of the various measures introduced over the years to keep our system in check. Most of the measures like ALS, COEs, were not popular when they were introduced, yet they had to be introduced. Most countries would like to introduce some of these measures that we have implemented here, but for various reasons they are unable to do so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the White Paper as it sets out how the Government intends to solve the transportation problems in Singapore or, in fact, to go about establishing a world class transport system. So far I must say that our attempts have been piecemeal and this White Paper sets out the problems clearly and how they are to be tackled over the years. If not tackled now, the problems will grow and become totally unmanageable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper sets out clearly the issues involved and how they are to be addressed. It is not always easy for the man-in-the-street to see the big picture. He is in fact concerned with his own needs. Many people I have talked to, the basic questions they ask are always the same: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Will I benefit from this vision? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will it mean more convenience and comfort? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will it mean higher cost for me or, as some people have glibly put it, \"World class system at first class prices\"? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to get the understanding, support and cooperation of all Singaporeans, these issues must be brought down from the philosophical level to the ground level. I believe more explanation and education of the public must be carried out by the LTA. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 518</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would want to comment on the financing framework mentioned in the White Paper. I support the principle that this framework is based on the concept of partnership, ie, Government provides infrastructure, commuters pay for operating costs, and operators have to operate efficiently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, I cannot understand why buses have been excluded from the financing arrangement. Two decades ago, we were all debating whether an all-bus solution would be preferred as a means of transport for Singaporeans or whether the train had a role to play. Today, looking at the White Paper, one wonders whether such debates had actually taken place. Indeed, it would appear more natural to ask whether an all-train solution would be more preferable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the White Paper states that we need to depend on MRT, LRT, and the buses. If buses are an integral part of the transportation system, then the financing framework should also take into account the buses. We need to focus on buses too. This is especially so when I am told that 41% of all the trips made today are by bus (3 million trips in all) and MRT accounts for 700,000 trips, which is about 10%. Singaporeans, especially from the lower income group, are still very much dependent on buses. As such, the Government should make every attempt to make sure that the bus operations continue to be efficient and our bus fares affordable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is stated in the White Paper that the Government is prepared to co-finance the purchase of the trains with SMRT by requiring SMRT to pay only for the historical cost of the train when replacing it 30 years later. For the existing MRT trains, the historical cost is $1.6 billion. Government will pay for any asset inflation. The same principle should at least apply to buses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of the bus fleet renewal is no cheaper than the train. Based on the age of at least 12 years for a bus, at an average cost of $250,000 per bus, and the current fleet of about 3,200 buses, bus operators have to pay $2 billion over the same \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 519</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> period of 30 years and, further, the entire $2 billion is to be paid over 30 years, unlike the MRT which needs to pay only $1.6 billion on the 30th year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the Minister to take another look at the bus operators on the new financing framework. I think they deserve to be part of the new social contract. The days of quantum jumps in productivity gains are over, and this is likely to place an upward pressure on bus fares. This, I submit, Sir, will in the long run be very regressive. Any assistance given to the bus operators should go towards maintaining fare structure and not to boost their bottom-line. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me state that the White Paper sets out clearly our vision for the future. It is not a dream. The key is in the implementation. The immediate improvements must be real and not merely cosmetic. Convenience, reliability, comfort, ease of use, affordability and competitive travel time, must be felt and enjoyed by our citizens. If commuters can see some of these benefits in the initial stages, I am confident that Singaporeans will go the extra mile with the Land Transport Authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Thomson GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I fully support the motion in the name of the Minister for Communications. The White Paper presents a comprehensive description of our policy on the future land transport system. It articulates our aim to have a world class land transport system capable of meeting the demands of a rapidly growing city, as well as satisfying the people's expectations of good service and high quality infrastructure. The paper promises us improvements in all aspects of a land transport system that incorporates the bus, the MRT and the taxi. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the operation philosophy and the long-term and short-term initiatives and objectives discussed in the White Paper. The Land Transport Authority's aim to build a $10 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> billion land transport system that will equal the airport and the port in standards must be supported by all Singaporeans. If the plans can be implemented in an orderly fashion, we will realise our vision of a city of excellence within the next 10 or 15 years. For this to happen, Singaporeans need to give the LTA their full cooperation and support as it strives to carry out its plans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we draw up long-term plans for a world class system, there are short-term measures we must take to improve the land transport system as it is today. The people want comfortable, convenient and rapid travel to their destinations. Immediate action has to be taken to solve the problems of congestion along our expressways and the crowding in our buses and MRT trains. The waiting time for buses and trains needs to be cut down by increasing the number of buses and trains. If the SBS and TIBS fleets are inadequate to cope with commuter demand in the morning and evening peak hours, can we not consider allowing more private buses, such as school and factory buses, etc, to carry passengers during those hours? This will help cut down waiting and travelling time, especially in those districts which are densely populated. We will also be making more efficient use of the available resources in the private buses. The Government can charge fees through additional licences for the bus owners to carry passengers during those limited hours. We should take private bus resources into account in our overall planning for improvement in bus services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the MRT, we need extra trains to reduce crowding. This is to help commuters at intermediate stations like Bedok, Kembangan or Bishan and Toa Payoh get seats in the trains on their way to work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the construction of covered pedestrian footpaths needs to be speeded up for the benefit of MRT and bus commuters. This is to make it more convenient for them to use public transport and to encourage more people, especially motorists, to do the same. Pedestrians also want footpaths which are lined with \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shady trees for natural shelter. For cyclists, they would welcome more bicycle parking facilities. I hope with these amenities for pedestrians and cyclists, more people will heed our call for a healthy lifestyle. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, living in a small island, it is reasonable and logical for us to focus on rail systems as the means of travel to all parts of the country. I feel rail must form the backbone of our land transport system. The Government's plan to build the North-East line must be expedited for the sake of people living in Hougang, Serangoon and Punggol. If services are satisfactory, I think a small increase in fare will not be an issue. In this age of progress, time is essential. If commuters can reach their destinations rapidly, I am sure they would be willing to pay a slightly higher fare. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in Chapter 4 of the White Paper, the LTA envisages a network of roads and expressways covering all parts of Singapore including Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. I am impressed with such meticulous and ambitious planning. With this network of roads and expressways, motorists will be able to go from one part of Singapore to another very quickly. I hope the construction of the Seletar and Tampines Expressways will be expedited, so that the current congestion along PIE can be relieved. The Government can also, as an immediate measure, install cameras at various places along the PIE to monitor the traffic jams that take place there daily. Regular announcements on the radio about the jams will help drivers to avoid them by taking other routes. I believe this immediate measure will help relieve the congestion along the PIE and help motorists to save fuel. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the land transport financing policy spelt out by LTA, which is based on cost-sharing, should have everyone's acceptance. But before we implement this idea, I think the Government should offer clearer explanations. Personally, I agree with the principle. The idea is that the Government will provide the infrastructure, the commuters will pay for the operating costs and the operators will provide good \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> service at reasonable fares. This partnership between Government, commuters and operators will lead to a consensus that will benefit all parties. It is important to stress the openness of the government when building the land transport infrastructure. The public will be able to know the actual expenditure incurred. The operators on their part must charge realistic fares, and any increase should be reasonable and commensurate with the level of service provided. In this way, the public will be satisfied and will not feel short-changed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the Government's decision to establish the principle of asset replacement at current cost borne by the generation using it. This means that operating costs will be lower and the higher cost of future asset replacements will be borne by future governments. The people should be thankful to the Government for this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, the White Paper sets out the challenges we face on the road to a world renowned land transport system. With the cooperation of all parties and the consensus of all Singaporeans, I am confident we will realise our aim to raise the standards of our land transport system and the quality of our life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in the debate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on a World Class Land Transport System provides a comprehensive plan to meet the transportation needs of our population. Most commuters whom I have spoken to are impressed with the various plans which are said to likely solve our transportation problems. While we solve the problems at this juncture for the next five years, new problems may arise and we will probably need another White Paper to look at this whole issue again and try to see how we can solve the problems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst the proposals are good and comprehensive, there are a few issues which require attention. First, with a first class transportation system, will transport cost for the average working class \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 523</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> commuters remain affordable? I think the major question in the minds of many commuters, particularly the working class, is the fares between their home and their work place. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about 14% of their income is being used for transportation. What would the threshold be? Would it be 20% of their income in the next five years? Is there a need for us to maintain some balance in allowing for affordability because a large number of commuters travel by public transport? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is very important. We must not have a high class transportation system that remains inaccessible to the greatest number of travelling public. I think this issue would have to be addressed by the LTA to ensure that there is a balance in terms of the charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is that with the changes to the present transportation system, will travelling time be reduced? That I think is an issue that many commuters are also asking, ie, whether the improved changes would be a change for the better. As pointed out in the White Paper, travelling will be made efficient and comfortable, but then how long is it going to take them to commute to their work places. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may have a first class transportation system but with a poor supporting feeder service, it would be counter-productive. People travel very quickly by MRT from one destination to another but the supporting feeder system takes them more than 45 minutes to get to their home. That defeats the whole purpose of having a world class system when they travel very quickly by MRT but the other system clogs them up. Therefore, it is crucial to build a more efficient supporting system, such as LRT and a good feeder system, that will allow commuters to reach their destination very quickly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area where the White Paper has not paid close attention is the needs of the growing aging population. In view of the fact that one in five persons would be 60 years and above in the next \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 524</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> two decades, what are the specific plans of LTA to make the public transportation system more user-friendly to the elderly? Do not forget that we would be having a larger number of go-slow and slow-slow aging commuters whose transportation needs are different from the more agile and mobile population. I have not seen any specific suggestions that the White Paper has addressed for this group. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the special needs of the disabled persons have not been looked into. One may argue that it is difficult to cater to their transportation needs in the White Paper. However, I feel that arrangements would have to be made to look into the travel needs of the disabled. Their travel needs have to be addressed so that they will also be brought into the mainstream of our society and enjoy it. As many of them need to work and commute, I think we should try as far as possible to see how we can make arrangements for a specialised transport system to meet their needs. These are the various issues that I hope the Minister would address to see how a better world class system can be realised. I support the proposals in the White Paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on a World Class Land Transport System is farsighted and has a wide-ranging coverage that touches on almost every aspect of our land transport system, from integrating land use and town planning to all modes of transportation system, such as MRT, motorcars, buses, taxis, etc, to transport management and financing. I said almost because I would like to touch on one important aspect that has not been highlighted later on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper presents a broad vision and a macro concept on how we can achieve the objective of a world class land transportation system. It reflects the importance the Government places in ensuring that our transport system will remain effective, efficient and workable in the next two or three decades. However, the success of such a vision would depend very much on the detailed implementation, setting a realistic target of expectation and the cooperation of all those involved in the system. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 525</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to realise that even if we have succeeded in implementing the plan as set out in this White Paper, we should not expect a total transformation of our land transport system and that our mobility will improve by quantum leaps. It is because very often, we forget our tremendous land and resource constraint and that Singapore is undergoing constant transformation, population increases, expansion of the city and, even going by a conservative growth rate, tremendous pressure will be exerted on our transportation needs in the future. Therefore, we should view the White Paper from a realistic perspective that if we do not constantly anticipate and find solutions to our transportation requirements in a decade or two, we will suffer the same fate as some other countries are experiencing. We have often quoted examples of travel woes of other places, like Bangkok, Taipei or, even closer home, Malaysia, but always harbour with complacency the thought that it would never happen to Singapore. But the fact remains that given all the constraints, we are more vulnerable and likely to be put in a situation such as those experienced in these countries because of our size and a lack of hinterland. There will always be pressure groups or people like the Opposition, for their own self-interest, to exploit the transport issue by distorting the reality that we face. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well and good to say that we should have a perfect land transport system where mobility is of an optimum level, that we should not wait a minute too long for our buses or taxi, that everyone should be able to own a car, that MRT should be run throughout the island, and areas that cannot be covered by MRT should have a comprehensive and elaborate LRT system. These thoughts are very seductive and appealing, but the reality is that there is no such thing as a perfect land transport system. Mobility is relative. It takes time to travel from one destination to another. It is the amount of time taken to accomplish that which determines how acceptable a country's land transport system is being managed. Of course, comparison helps, but it has to be an apple-with-an-apple \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 526</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> type of comparison. One cannot expect traffic flow in the city to be compared with the traffic flow in the countryside. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the aspect that I wanted to comment earlier, although I consider the White Paper wide-ranging and comprehensive, one aspect which I feel merits serious consideration, in order to fill up the missing link to the whole scheme of things, is the planning and provision for the pedestrians. The proposal of decentralising commercial and other economic activities to the development of regional and sub-regional fringe centres at MRT stations and by reducing the need for people to travel by locating employment centres like industrial estates, business parks and commercial centres near residential areas is sound and logical. Even integrating residential and commercial development with MRT stations to a great extent would help to minimise the necessity for commuters to travel. However, the scope has its limitations because there is an optimum number of MRT stations that can be built. Major bus exchanges or main arterial roads that buses can travel on have their own limitations also. Besides, residing on top or near MRT stations or near one's workplace, although it can be convenient, can also be monotonous. Because it means that you have to work and rest in the same environment. This may not be that desirable. The fact is that the majority of our people will still have to reside in areas peripheral to the major transportation nodes. This may not be a total negative option, because most of us do not mind trading a bit of inconvenience for a lifestyle that gives us the opportunity to work in a busy and bustling urban environment in the day time and returning to the more tranquil and homely surrounding in the evening. This environmental change will provide us with a better physical and psychological balance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, much would have to be done to cater for the mobility of this large pool of commuters, making it more convenient for them to travel from their home to the nearest transportation node. While it is well and good to create a more efficient transportation network consisting of cars, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 527</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> MRT, buses, LRT and taxis, etc, that can save travelling time, the result will be negated if one has to walk an unacceptably long distance to arrive at these transportation facilities. I therefore propose that the Ministry of Communications and possibly the Ministry of National Development look into the planning needs of the pedestrians, set comfortable target of the maximum distance for anyone to walk from his or her dwelling to the nearest transportation node available. This can be done, firstly, through the careful planning of a comprehensive network which locates all major and secondary transportation nodes at strategic locations within walking distance for all. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the provision of a well-planned pedestrian route that is conducive for walking. This can be in the form of a network of green spine that is under cover or shaded by trees integrated with the landscaped area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the pedestrian routes should be safe from vehicular traffic, so that even children and senior citizens can make use \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of them freely. I would therefore request that the above be considered and incorporated into the proposed White Paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no effort should be spared in making our land transport system work efficiently, because the flow of traffic in a city is not unlike the arteries in our body. If they choke, we expire. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 528</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the Debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be continued on what day, Mr Mah? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Tomorrow, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Twenty-three Minutes to Six o'clock pm\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 529</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appendix 1 \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>FUTURE PLAN FOR BUKIT TIMAH MARKET</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. \n  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for the Environment what is the future plan for the Bukit Timah Market located at Upper Bukit Timah Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to URA_s Bukit Timah Draft Master Plan, the Bukit Timah Market will be affected by redevelopment.

The SCHCCs are located at the Bukit Batok, Jurong, Toa Payoh, Geylang, Hougang and Tampines polyclinics and at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital. (ii) The primary function of SCHCCs is to provide day rehabilitation to disabled elderly. The services provided in the SCHCCs are rehabilitation and training in activities of daily living, for patients following strokes, management of incontinence, geriatric health screening and assessment, health education of the elderly and education of the carers in the care of the elderly. Transport to and from the Centres is also available. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees charged per visit to the SCHCC depend on the household income: \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Monthly Household Income       Fee Per Visit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        Public Assistance               Free\r\n\r\n        &lt;$1000                          $5\r\n\r\n        $1000 - $2000                   $10\r\n\r\n        &gt;$2000-$3000                    $15\r\n\r\n        &gt;$3000                          $20\r\n\r\n</pre> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees for transport vary depending on the distance travelled and the type of patient : \n  <pre>\r\n\r\n     Within 4 km - $2 for ambulant patients and $5 for wheelchair\r\n\r\n                   patients\r\n\r\n     &gt; 4 km      - $6 for both ambulant and wheelchair patients.\r\n\r\n</pre> (iii) The SCHCCs are fully utilised presently.

The Centres make about 5,000 trips to transport the elderly to the Centres for rehabilitation. (iv) The Ministry's plan is to encourage and assist Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) besides the HNF to set up rehabilitative day care centres for the elderly.
