On 20th August 1993, I received a letter dated 20th August 1993 from the Acting Secretary-General of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) informing me that Mr Chiam See Tong has been expelled from the Singapore Democratic Party with immediate effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st August 1993, the Clerk of Parliament wrote to Mr Chiam referring to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this letter and asking Mr Chiam to confirm immediately that he had been so expelled from the Singapore Democratic Party. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam replied on 21st August 1993 to state that the Central Executive Committee of the SDP had sent him a letter on 20th August 1993 to expel him from the Party, but that the SDP letter was not valid and was illegal, and that the Supreme Authority of the SDP was the Party Conference comprising all the cadres. Mr Chiam also stated that a Special Party Conference had been requisitioned by cadres of the Party but that the Central Executive Committee had failed to convene such a Conference but instead had proceeded to expel him. He maintained that the Central Executive Committee's act of sacking him was unconstitutional and illegal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam therefore requested that the Speaker \"holds his hands until the legality of my expulsion from the SDP is decided at the next Party Conference of the SDP, which has already been properly requisitioned.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 27th August 1993, Mr Chiam wrote to me to say that on 25th August 1993 he had obtained an Order of Injunction from the Courts against the Central Executive Committee of the SDP restraining them from expelling him from the Party. He attached a copy of the Court Order in his letter to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these developments, in particular Mr Chiam's contention that his expulsion was illegal and the steps he has taken to challenge the validity of the expulsion, it is not appropriate for me to ask Parliament to take any decision until the parties have resolved these issues. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>DEATH OF DR YEOH GHIM SENG AND DR TAY ENG SOON</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Announcement by Mr Speaker)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I wish to take this opportunity to place on record the deaths of Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng, former Speaker of Parliament on 3rd June 1993, and of Dr Tay Eng Soon, former Senior Minister of State for Education and Member for Eunos GRC, on 5th August 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I desire on behalf of the House to express our sense of the loss we have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sustained and our sympathy with the families of the late Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng and Dr Tay Eng Soon. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 397</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OBITUARY ON THE LATE DR YEOH GHIM SENG AND THE LATE DR TAY ENG SOON</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are sojourners on this earth. No day is promised to any of us. For so long as we are on this earth, we try to make the best use of our time, in the best way that we could. Many of us would use that time for ourselves, for our families. That is to be expected. Some would simply waste it, but then that is their own look out, as it is their life. But there are some who not only make full use of their time and life for themselves and their families, they also give much of their time to others. They give to others more than they receive. Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng, our former Speaker, and Dr Tay Eng Soon, our former colleague, were two such rare individuals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng passed away on 3rd June this year, after a period of illness. Dr Yeoh was elected as MP for Joo Chiat in 1966, during the turbulent years of early independent Singapore. He had remained as a Member for Joo Chiat constituency until the \n  <br>\n  <br>1988&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Elections. He retired after serving nearly 22 years for the nation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within less than two years of being elected as an MP for Joo Chiat, Dr Yeoh was elected as Deputy Speaker in July 1968, and then as Speaker in January 1970, an appointment he held until January 1989. As our longest serving Speaker from 1970 to 1989, he guided Singapore through one of its most constructive phases of development. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of us who were in this House when Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng was the Speaker, we fondly remember him as a Speaker who exercised his responsibility with fairness and firmness. He brought decorum, dignity and esteem to the office of Speaker. He had always been indulgent and patient with the Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yeoh was not only well-known for his distinguished contribution to Singapore as a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 398</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Parliamentarian and Speaker but was also renowned for his excellent surgical skills in the medical fraternity in Singapore and in the region. He was the first Singaporean to be appointed Professor of Surgery at the then University of Malaya in 1955. Because of his contribution to medicine in Singapore, a Yeoh Ghim Seng Professorship in Surgery was instituted in his name by his former students and well-wishers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Yeoh had not only won the respect of this House but also that of all Singaporeans. We send our deepest condolence to the family of the late Dr Yeoh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Tay Eng Soon, his death came as a shock to me when I heard of it at Parliament Annexe on 5th August this year. Some of our MPs who were with me at the time were equally shocked and saddened by the news. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tay was first elected to Parliament in 1980 in the constituency of River Valley. With the changes in the constituency boundaries, Dr Tay was supposed to contest in Tanglin in the 1988 General Elections. However, the call of duty demanded a last minute switch for him to lead the PAP team to contest in the Eunos GRC. Like any of our PAP's loyal and dedicated members, he stoutly took on the task. He knew that it was a tough fight but he took it in his stride. Dr Tay and his team won the 1988 General Elections in Eunos.

But Dr Tay's contribution was not just confined to education only. He held a number of other posts. He found time to serve in the PAP Community Foundation and the National Kidney Foundation. With his departure from this world, he left many vacancies to be filled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tay's dedication to his work, constituency and family is known to all of us. Even when Dr Tay was in hospital, his mind was still on his work.

Even when he was in hospital just before his death, he was preparing his National Day speech for his constituency's National Day Dinner which he had hoped to attend. But, alas, he could not keep that appointment because his illness overcame him.

About 6,000 are living in 1-room flats. Elderly persons are those aged 60 years and above. These elderly households consist of either a single elderly person living alone, two elderly single persons sharing a flat, or an elderly couple living on their own. In many of these cases, particularly the early immigrants, the elderly residents have to fend for themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If nothing is done to assist these elderly households in their living arrangements and facilities, in such a way as to enhance \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 400</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> their mobility and independence, many of these elderly persons will be prematurely forced to go into institutional care. We should make it possible for the elderly to live in the community for as long as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce that my Ministry has, in conjunction with the Ministry of Community Development (MCD), worked out a scheme to carry out improvement works to upgrade the living conditions of the elderly staying in 1-room rental flats. Suitable 1-room rental blocks with high concentrations of elderly households will be selected for the improvement works, which include modification of lifts to stop at every floor, making the bathrooms and toilets non-slip, replacement of existing taps with taps that have 'lift up' handles, and support handbars in the toilets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kick off the scheme, a pilot project will be implemented in three blocks where more than a quarter of the households are elderly households. The three blocks are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blk 5 Banda Street; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blk 4 Telok Blangah Crescent; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blk 90 Pipit Road. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will also work with MCD to arrange for a voluntary welfare organisation to provide community-based care and support services such as home-help services, meals and goods delivery services, and Befriender services, to the elderly households in each block. An administrative office will be set up at each block to facilitate the work of the respective voluntary organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, the elderly residents can continue to live independently, while at the same time being assured of help if needed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr S.

First, the physical improvements to the flat to make it more convenient for the elderly to live independently. Secondly, a strong welfare support system so that services are extended to them if needed, such as the Befriender service, etc. So this scheme can only work if these two things come together and we have to work closely with the Advisor to the Citizens' Consultative Committee in each constituency to try and encourage them to set up such voluntary services. Right now, there is no firm intention to group all the elderly in a constituency in one block. We leave it to the Advisor. In discussing this pilot scheme with some of the Advisors, some prefer to keep up to maybe half of the block for the senior citizens and the other half for the normal households so that the block has a mix. Other Advisors are prepared to have a higher percentage. We will leave it to the Advisor to decide what percentage he feels comfortable. We also leave it to the Advisor to work with the voluntary organisations to make the scheme work. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 401</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SINGAPORE'S INVOLVEMENT IN REGIONAL GROUPINGS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Objectives and roles)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following question stood in the name of Mr Robert Chua Teck Chew - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

It is desirable for siblings to study in the same school. Thus, the highest priority or Phase 1 is for a child with a sibling in the same school. In 1993, the percentage registered under Phase 1 is 41% as compared to 37% in 1991.

This is as it should be. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phases 2A and 2B provide for children with other school connections.

Nevertheless, I would not like to confirm this fact until the Inquiry Panel has had time to go further into this.

In this respect, I would like to assure the Member that there should not be any possibility for price-fixing which will benefit individual members who are investing their CPF savings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of security features of the CPF system, in view of the large number of CPF members now investing in shares, the Board has, in fact, looked into this matter extensively. It is well aware of the need to ensure that members who enter the investment market have their investments and savings safeguarded. The Board has actually included various security features in the computerised as well as the manual system to ensure that CPF savings withdrawn for investment \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> purposes cannot be wrongfully withdrawn or siphoned off. All withdrawals of CPF savings for investments are channelled direct from the Board to the member's investment account with an agent bank without passing through the member's own bank account. This prevents the loss of CPF savings in transit. In addition, the computerised system checks the validity of all applications of withdrawal before the Board releases CPF savings into the investment account of a member. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, shares bought with CPF savings are held in custody by the agent bank. They are not held by the CPF member. In addition, the shares must be registered in the name of the agent bank's nominee instead of the CPF member himself. This ensures that upon sale of the shares, the proceeds will be returned directly to the member's investment account instead of going to the member himself personally. All transactions are properly documented. In addition, the Board and the agent bank send regular statements to the member informing him of all his transactions of purchase or sale of shares authorised by him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regular audits are also carried out to ensure that all procedures laid down by the CPF Board and the agent banks are complied with. As most of the transactions are computerised, the audits will also cover the computer system for handling such withdrawal and purchase of shares. With this safeguard, I think the security of members' CPF savings is quite well assured. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 408</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ABUSE OF FOREIGN MAIDS BY EMPLOYERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Measures to discourage)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Labour what measures are being taken to discourage abuse of foreign maids by employers. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry condemns the abuse of foreign domestic workers by their employers.

The Ministry works closely with the Police to ensure that employers who abuse their maids are dealt with firmly. Employers who are convicted of abusing their foreign domestic maids face severe penalties, including imprisonment and caning. They are also barred from future employment of foreign domestic workers.

The reason is that unlike other employees, domestic workers work for a single employer and live with their employer for the whole period of time. So, foreign domestic workers will live in the households of their employer. Their terms and conditions of employment are highly variable. Some employers require their domestic maids to look after babies; others require their maids to tend to aged persons; some require their maids to do cooking and household cleaning; others just require them only to do maybe household cleaning and no cooking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the maid lives with the employer and that the conditions are so highly variable it makes it very difficult to have this category of workers included in the Employment Act, which can only spell out very general conditions. In fact, the Employment Act exempts or excludes seamen from such coverage basically for the same reason that they are also working and living on board a vessel for the whole duration, essentially 24 hours a day on board the vessel. Hence, we think that it is not practical to try to include foreign or even local domestic workers within the ambit of the Employment Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry does provide service to the domestic workers, be they foreign or local domestic workers, in the sense that if they have any disputes or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> grievances with their employer, they are free to come to my Ministry to lodge a complaint or to raise their concerns.

The Asiavision news exchange has been further enhanced this year with the computerisation of the Asiavision Coordinating Centre in Kuala Lumpur. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;News exchanges have also been taking place between the national news agencies of the ASEAN countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the setting up of an ASEAN or Asian news network, the initiative should not come from the Government. The decision is best left to the media professionals themselves in the various countries. I am sure they will take advantage of the growing media market in the region to expand their operations and gradually challenge the Western domination of global news. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 410</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MASS MEDIA</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Establishment of another newspaper group and receiving foreign broadcasting stations)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. \n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Information and the Arts, in view of the need for more regional and international news coverage in support of our regionalisation thrust and the huge increase in readership and viewership, whether it is timely now (i) to allow another pro-Singapore newspaper group to be established in Singapore; (ii) to allow some reputable foreign and regional broadcasting stations to be received in Singapore; and (iii) to direct the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation to network into the region to give better and more current reporting. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (for the Minister for Information and the Arts):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Information and the Arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer the three points raised by Mr Chia as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 412</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government does not determine the number of local newspapers or local newspaper companies in Singapore.

Whether there should be another pro-Singapore newspaper group is for the market to decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, foreign and regional broadcasting stations are already being received in Singapore. We receive all Malaysian radio and TV broadcasts and some from Indonesia. Currently, BBC World Service can be received 24 hours a day on FM radio, while Singapore Cable Vision's NewsVision channel carries CNN as well as news bulletins from International Television Network (one hour), NHK (half an hour), Australia Broadcasting Corporation (half an hour) and BBC (half an hour). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cable TV is introduced in Singapore, we will have the channel capacity to accommodate more foreign broadcasting services in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, SBC has been working hard to improve its regional coverage. It is a member of Asiavision, a regional news pool covering countries like Japan, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and others. Through Asiavision, SBC has continuous access to reports on the latest developments in these countries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC also has bilateral arrangements with broadcasting stations of neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, China and Australia. Under these arrangements, SBC can directly lift any local story aired over their radio or TV channels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBC has found these links very useful.

Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say, at the outset, Sir, that the incidence of firearm robbery cases today is low. There were nine firearm robbery cases in 1992 - a drop from the 174 cases reported 20 years ago in 1973. So Members may be wondering why then is this Bill being moved. Let me explain. The Police are extremely concerned over regional trends which show a marked increase in the use of firearms in the commission of crimes and an upsurge in the flow of smuggled arms across borders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 419</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are probably aware of the crime situation in the United States and the easy availability of arms there. But they may not know that in our region itself, countries are also experiencing a very big rise in violent crimes involving the use of firearms. For example, in China, the authorities are alarmed at the increase in murder, robbery and kidnapping cases in recent years involving the use of firearms and have taken measures to counter this rise. A related phenomenon is the increasing trade in black-market arms, most of which are being smuggled into the various countries in the region. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Taiwan, in 1992 alone, a total of 6,377 units of arms, including rifles, handguns, imitation arms, were recovered by the authorities - more than a four-fold increase from the number recovered in 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And our closest neighbour, Malaysia, which has similar firearm laws as Singapore, has not been spared. Over the past five years, there have been almost 3,500 firearm offences in Malaysia, about 16 times that of Singapore, calculated on a per capita basis. The incidence of firearm robberies, despite stringent enforcement by the Malaysian Police, remains high. In Malaysia, as with China, an important factor contributing to this rise is the increased inflow of smuggled arms into the country. Cases of multiple murders involving firearms that come to mind are those of Bentong Kali who killed 16 persons before he was shot dead by the Malaysian Police, as well as the secret society killings in Sungei Petani. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police are also concerned that as China and the Indochinese countries continue to open up, the Police expect the supply of arms smuggled out from these countries to increase. Some will find their way into Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely important that we do not let such trafficking and illegal use of firearms, including grenades and bombs, to creep into our country. In Singapore, the recovery of hand grenades in two recent incidents provides justification for this concern. The first incident involved \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 420</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the discovery of two usable \"Vietnam War era\" grenades in a canal at Bedok in October 1991. The second incident involved an armed robbery of a goldsmith shop where two similar grenades were recovered on 19th November last year. These incidents underscore the possibility that firearms are being brought into Singapore from other places in the region. On 30th March 1992, one pregnant lady was killed when the car she was in was blown up with the use of explosives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, the signal must go out clearly and loudly to all criminals, foreign and local, that we will take a very tough stand in Singapore. Otherwise, Singapore will not be spared from a rise in violent offences such as robberies, involving the use of firearms. Therefore, we need to amend the Arms Offences Act to provide greater deterrent effect. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments will also plug a loophole in the Arms Offences Act. Under section 3(3) of the Act, any person who is armed at the time of the commission or apprehension for any of the scheduled offences - in other words, he has an arm on his person - will be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life and at least 6 strokes of the cane. But if he discharges his firearm without intending to injure anyone in the course of commission of the offence, the law does not provide for a heavier penalty which is death. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this so? This is because section 4 of the Act imposes the mandatory death penalty only in cases where an offender uses or attempts to use an arm with the intention to cause physical injury to a person. To secure a conviction under section 4, the prosecution therefore has to prove the requisite intention to cause injury. In cases where injury or death is caused, of course, it would be easier for the prosecution to argue that the offender must have intended to cause injury as it is a logical consequence of the act of his discharge of the weapon. In cases where no injury is caused, the prosecution will find it difficult, if not impossible, to prove this intention. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 421</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Indeed, this line of defence was put forward by three goldsmith robbers in a recent case. Members may remember reading the report of this case recently in June where three shots had been fired by the robbers during the robbery. No one was injured during the shooting. The prosecution sought to prove that two of the shots were fired at a security guard and another shot was fired at another guard with intent to cause injury. The accused denied any such intention. The Court found, on the evidence, that the prosecution had not proved beyond reasonable doubt an intention to injure the security guards and, accordingly, the capital charges were reduced to possession of arms at the time of commission of a scheduled offence under section 3(3), an offence which carries a penalty of life imprisonment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is concerned that this defect in the Act, if not cured, will lead to a situation where criminals who are familiar with the current legal position and bent on using the firearms would not hesitate to discharge them. Because of this defect, there is a possibility that seasoned criminals who discharged their firearms in the course of the commission of a scheduled offence may get off on the lesser offence of possession. They know that they have a chance of escaping the death penalty by pleading an absence of intention to injure any person. Although evidence of intention can be inferred from the surrounding circumstances, eg, where someone has been killed or injured as a result of the discharge of the firearm, it is difficult to prove such an intention where no one is injured. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the law as it stands now is open to criticism because it in fact favours a criminal who intends to injure but who cannot shoot well. Surely this cannot be right. In law, logic or in policy, possession of firearms is a grave offence. Carrying it with you on your person when you are committing an offence is even worse. Discharging it when committing an offence must be viewed most seriously. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for such offences should not be made dependent on an \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 422</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> accused's intention. A firearm is, as we all know, a very lethal weapon, and when fired, it can cause death or injury even to innocent bystanders in the vicinity, whatever the intention of the accused may be. Therefore, arms and firearms must be distinguished from other weapons like knives, parangs and so on. Not only to innocent bystanders but the discharge of a firearm has a tremendous effect of causing alarm on the population. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, crimes of violence of this kind must be strongly deterred and suppressed. In particular, the unlawful use of arms must not be condoned. Otherwise, it will lead to greater use of arms for unlawful purposes in Singapore and we will face the experience of many other countries in this regard. Peace and good order, which we value so much in Singapore, will be threatened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may go on to the amendments, Sir. The amendments achieve the following changes. First, by introducing a presumption clause under section 4(2) of the Act, vide clause 2, any person who has discharged a firearm will be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have intended to cause injury to a person. The evidential burden will now be on the offender. To rebut the presumption, he has to produce evidence to prove that he did not intend to cause injury to anyone. This will assist the prosecution to overcome the evidentiary burden in this section. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the use of presumption clause for capital offence is not new. There are numerous precedents in the Misuse of Drugs Act where it is provided, for example, that where a person is proved to have the keys of anything containing a controlled drug, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have had that drug in his possession. Under section 18(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, it is also provided that where a person is found in possession of a controlled drug, he is presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have known the nature of the controlled drug that he possesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, and this is the main amendment, a new section 4A is introduced creating a new capital offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 423</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Under this new section 4A, any person who discharges or attempts to discharge an arm in the course of committing or attempting to commit any offence listed in the Schedule, in other words, a scheduled offence, will be guilty of an offence punishable with death. This is to rectify the defect I mentioned earlier, ie, to provide for a heavier penalty for an offender who actually discharges or who attempts to discharge an arm while in the course of commission or attempted commission of a scheduled offence. Under this new section, there is no requirement for the prosecution to prove that the offender had the intention to cause injury to any person by the discharge or attempted discharge of his arm. As long as the prosecution can prove that he discharged his arm or attempted to discharge his arm while in the course of committing a scheduled offence, he will be guilty of this new offence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for making attempted discharge of an arm while in the course of commission or attempted commission of a scheduled offence a capital offence is because offenders concerned have done everything they could in respect of these offences. In the case of attempted discharge, the arm failed to fire for reasons which are beyond their control. In the case of attempted commission, the offence was not completed because of external factors such as the timely arrival of the Police or the intervention of security guards. In any case, the public is equally put to alarm and fear by such attempts. There is therefore no reason to treat them otherwise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, vide clause 4 of the Bill, section 5 will also be re-enacted to make the accomplice of an offender of section 4A who is present at the scene of the crime and who ought reasonably to be aware of the fact that the offender is armed and who fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the discharge of the arm guilty of an offence punishable with death. This is the principle which is presently set out in the Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 424</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, one minor procedural amendment is that under section 12 of the Arms Offences Act, the President is empowered to amend the Schedule to the Act by an order. In modern legislation, such powers are normally conferred on the Minister. My Ministry proposes to amend the section to transfer this power to the Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC):</b> Sir, having listened to the background given by the Minister, I rise in support of this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increasing flow in firearms trafficking, as has been told earlier to the House, is a trend that we cannot afford to pay scant attention to. While the use of firearms in Singapore has not reached alarming proportions, I am in total agreement with the Ministry of Home Affairs in taking a proactive approach by introducing whatever measures that are deemed necessary to keep our crime rate as low as possible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is beyond doubt that our strict laws have been an effective deterrent in keeping serious crimes to a manageable level and in keeping out hard-core criminals from using Singapore as their base of operations. There must be no let-up in sending such strong signals in order to enable us to continue to enjoy a safe environment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the proposed amendment, ie, clause 4 which re-enacts section 5, the death penalty can be meted out to an accomplice who fails to take reasonable steps to prevent the use of any arm by the main criminal who normally is the mastermind. In this connection, I must admit that I do not feel comfortable as my concern is that accomplices are sometimes coerced or threatened and may not have agreed to the use of arms when the offence is committed. Here, I want to be assured by the Minister that whilst chances for a wrong conviction may be remote, he is fully satisfied that there are sufficient checks and balances before the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 425</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> death penalty is imposed on accomplices. I would therefore be grateful for the Minister's clarification on this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I once again support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have had the dubious distinction of having been a victim of an armed robber at gun point. I hasten to add not in Singapore but at some place else. So I fully support stringent measures to control arms and control the use of arms. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reservation about the amendment Bill is really a reservation about making mandatory death penalties. When a judge is faced with a problem, he has to decide what sentence is appropriate. The reason why we give judges the discretion to impose sentences is that Parliament cannot foresee all the possibilities. And the strength of the common law system that we have is that we do not try to foresee all the possibilities. When you impose a mandatory sentence, you take away that flexibility from the judge and all the more so when you impose a mandatory death sentence, because this is the ultimate sentence and cannot be recalled. Before this House passes the amendments, I hope that we all understand what we are doing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the Arms Offences Act, if you possess a firearm, you will go to jail, you will be caned. If you possess a firearm for one of the scheduled offences, in other words, the more serious offences, it is life imprisonment plus caning. If you fire a gun in the course of an offence with intent to injure someone, then under the present section 4, that is mandatory death sentence. I do not think there is any problem with that. And the amendment that is being proposed means that the presumption is that when you fire the gun, you intend to injure someone. What I am apprehensive about is the new section 4A which basically says that if you fire a gun when committing one of the scheduled offences, whether you intend to injure someone or not, that means death; and it also means death for all your accomplices. Does this in fact improve the deterrent effect of the Arms Offences Act? I do not \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 426</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> think so. I am not sure whether it is really desirable to treat people who fire a gun accidentally, let us say, on par with someone who fires a gun in order to hurt someone else. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens if you got a robber who accidentally discharges the gun? This is the use without intent. Mandatory death sentence. Mandatory death sentence for accomplices too. Are we comfortable with that? What happens if you got an armed robber who fires in the air, a warning shot? No intent to injure anyone. Mandatory death sentence for him and mandatory death sentence for his accomplices. Will it improve matters? Do armed robbers take these things into account? Do they go and check up the legislation first to see whether it is mandatory or not? I doubt it very much. So I am not sure the deterrent effect is increased one bit by having a mandatory sentence. You might have situations where the imposition of a mandatory sentence makes a desperate man more desperate. For example, look at the scheduled offences. One of the scheduled offences is kidnapping. Another one is abduction. Another one is resisting arrest. You have someone who accidentally discharges his gun in the course of a kidnapping. Mandatory death sentence. He has taken the victim already. Is the victim going to survive if he knows that once he is charged there is no chance of anything except death? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many years ago in this House, an amendment was proposed to the Kidnapping Act to make death sentence mandatory for kidnapping. As was pointed out by the then Dean of the Law Faculty, Prof. Tommy Koh, if you did this, you almost guarantee that the victim is not going to live because the kidnappers would rather kill him than run the risk of him identifying them. You are in effect doing the same thing with this amendment. If you have a kidnapping and somebody accidentally discharges a gun or discharges a gun in warning, without intent to kill anyone, that is a mandatory death sentence. The victim is going to be dead for sure. Resisting arrest, similarly. Somebody in the course of resisting arrest accidentally discharges his gun, he loses nothing more by actually shooting to kill \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 427</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the next time when the police come for him. So I hope we are sure what we are doing down here. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand the Minister's concern and I fully support the Minister's concern to ensure that Singapore is a hostile environment to people who want to traffic guns. My primary apprehension is: are we going to make things worse by imposing a mandatory death sentence? Is it not sufficient if we keep it as it is by amending section 4 with the presumption? If you take out the new section 4A, it will make no difference in my submission. Because basically what you will have is that if somebody does fire a gun, there is a presumption that he meant to injure someone and that means he can be convicted and sentenced to death. If he can satisfy the Judge that he fires without intent to injure anyone, then you can get him for possession of the gun under section 33 or 34, send him to jail for life, and cane him with six strokes. Is there really a need to make it a capital offence just to fire a gun irrespective of the intention? I hope that Members of this House would seriously consider what I have said when they vote on these amendments. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments of Prof. Walter Woon. I would like to ask the Minister whether he knows of the Kuala Lumpur experience, ie, whether Kuala Lumpur has this mandatory death sentence on the possession of firearms. As such, we often see robberies in car parks where the robbers just simply shoot because it is mandatory death sentence anyway. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the Nominated Member, Prof. Walter Woon, I am not quite sure who he is speaking for. Is he speaking for the criminals or is he speaking for the security and safety of the society at large? I support the Arms Offences (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has stated just now, in the United States, buying of arms is as easy as turning your palm. So the use of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 428</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> arms is very prevalent. It is increasing all the time. It is reported widely in the newspapers. We are all very familiar with it. The Minister has also said that in Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan, the use of arms in criminal offences is very common and the cases involve casualty, death or injury. As a matter of fact, the use of arms or explosives in robbery and other criminal activities is getting more and more serious. Fortunately, in Singapore, it is not so serious. But it does not mean that we should be complacent and we should not take any precautionary measures to ensure that this situation will not happen in Singapore and the crime situation here will not deteriorate. In fact, we must take all precautionary measures against possession and use of arms. There is only one way to achieve this objective, ie, by imposing heavy punishment against the potential criminals for the use of arms and explosives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have stated, I am not quite sure whether the NMP is aware of the mindset of the People's Action Party members. We all want our people to work and live in peace. We hope that our tourists will also be safe in Singapore. We also hope that our investors will be very safe, physically and financially. So I would ask Prof. Walter Woon this question: if a robber committing a robbery in a goldsmith shop fired a shot and a heart patient who happened to be around got a shock and died, then can we say it was just his bad luck? This robber, if arrested, goes in for a maximum of life imprisonment. An innocent life is lost and the criminal does not get what he deserves. I feel it is not quite right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin also appears to be speaking on behalf of the foreign maids. Of course, on humanitarian ground, it might be acceptable in her case. But Prof. Walter Woon seems to be speaking for the bad guys all the time! I just do not understand why he does not consider the potential victims - those people who might lose their life as potential victims in this kind of cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the amendments proposed by the Minister. I feel that these amendments will make Singapore a safer and more secure society. Prof. Woon says that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 429</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> armed robber may have no intention to use his arms. If he has no intention, then why does he carry arms or explosives? When he is in illegal possession of arms or explosives, the intention is very clear. I support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong (Bukit Gombak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my concern regarding the punishment for the accomplice. This is simply because, if you look at the proposed section here, any person who carries a gun, and if he is present at the scene of the offence, it would be mandatory death sentence for him if convicted. One would have noticed that in past cases, \"present at the scene\" could even cover cases of robbery at a hotel where the robber entered the room and his accomplice stayed outside at the corridor. In the past it had been decided by the Court of law that he was present and he was then convicted accordingly. Imagine for a moment, two or three persons decided to rob a goldsmith shop. One of them acted as the driver. So he sat in the car outside the goldsmith shop. The other two who were carrying arms would enter the goldsmith shop. In the course of robbery, one of them opened fire. If we look at the definition of this section here, the one who sat in the car, ready to run with these people, would also be convicted and sentenced to death. I feel that it is too harsh. Where firearm is concerned, I really do not know how one can prevent the other from firing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine for a moment, three robbers agreed to rob a goldsmith shop. They agreed that no one should fire. Actually they know the law. They said that no one should fire the gun. But one is at one end of the shop and the other is at the other end. How on earth can he prevent him from firing? It is clearly stated in the Bill that \"he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the use of such arm\". How do you prevent the use of such arm? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge this House to consider that in the case of a person who is not the actual perpetrator of the offence, life penalty should be sufficient. Because if you look at the common intention provision, you would notice that one could be some distance away from the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 430</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> scene but, nonetheless, could be brought in under the provision on common intention, ie, section 34 of the Penal Code. Then he would be punished accordingly, the same force as the actual perpetrator of the crime. Therefore, I would urge this House to seriously consider that in the case of an accomplice, life imprisonment would be sufficient, rather than death penalty, in the circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Speaker, I just want to make a response to what Mr Choo said. First, I think it behoves Singaporeans to be humanitarian towards foreign labour. Secondly, I think Singapore's good name was being questioned in what I was saying, and Mr Choo would do well to support me as well in this matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, may I clarify? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I fully agree with Dr Soin's statement. Therefore, I can accept on the humanitarian ground. But I would like to rebut what Mr Ling said just now. He was trying to encourage people to commit crime. I do not understand. If he was not encouraging people to commit crime, then he should support this Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank the Members who have spoken. Let me refer to Prof. Walter Woon's comments, and he has got an amendment to substitute life imprisonment for death penalty which I take it is consequent to the views he has expressed. There are different ways in which we can approach the examination of this amendment. One could take a very legalistic, purist, approach to analysing this amendment. But as the Minister for Home Affairs in charge of making sure that our peace, security and law and order are maintained, I must take into account the hard facts of life. One hard fact of life, let me say at the outset, is that in the many discussions I had with the Commissioner of Police and the Director of CID, the Director of CID has told me that the perception or understanding in the criminal underworld when they amended the Act in 1973 was that discharge per se of a gun would carry the death penalty. It may have been a mistaken non-legal \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 431</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> academic interpretation of the Act. But he says that the underworld understood it to be that for 20 years until recently. Whether it is until recently because of the goldsmith robbery case, I do not know. But until recently, the underworld has understood the law to be that discharge per se of a gun you get the death penalty. The Director of CID strongly believes that is one of the reasons why there has been a low incidence of firearm robbery. I say to this House that if you want to keep Singapore away from the path of the United States and other countries where the use of guns is commonplace, we better give a clear signal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I think it is relevant for me to mention that the World Competitiveness Report 1993 ranked 23 OECD countries and 15 NICs on a wide variety of matters. One of the matters which was ranked was: Is there confidence among the people that the person and property are protected (on a scale of 1 to 10)? Singapore was ranked 9.5. In other words, people's perception that the person and property are protected, we ranked 9.5, the highest among the NICs and higher than the highest ranked country amongst the OECD, with Japan at 9.1. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to basic facts and the real world. Do we want to keep it this way? I say it is in our interest to keep it this way. How has this been achieved? By fortuitous circumstances? I do not think so. I think the factors are, firstly, we have had strict laws when appropriate. Secondly, laws have been enforced effectively and fairly by an efficient Police force and an impartial and efficient system of courts. Thirdly, there is public support and cooperation with the Police. And I think we have got to keep it that way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to the points that he has raised. First, the question about mandatory and non-mandatory sentence and accidentally discharging a gun. I would again urge that we look at the situation. What is the situation? Who are we talking about? The person who has discharged the gun, who will be subject to this strict law, and it is a harsh strict law, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 432</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that it almost brings the law to that of strict liability, but I make no apologies for it. Who are we talking about? The person must have done the following. First, he must have somehow got hold of a gun. He is in unlawful possession of a gun in the first place. That is fact number one. Second, he carries the gun on his person. That is already bad, even if he is not committing an offence or a scheduled offence. Third, he plans to commit a robbery and he carries a gun along with him. The law deals with that. The situation we are talking about is where he has the audacity to actually in the course of committing, not any offence, a scheduled offence - we single out the more serious offences - he discharges the gun. I say that he deserves no sympathy from us whatsoever. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His claim that it went out accidentally is hollow because we want to give a signal to all those contemplating this sequence of events - don't do it. Don't do it in Singapore because the penalty is the most severe penalty that the courts can give out. You have anything less than that, judging by the experiences in other countries, they will take chances. This is the advice of the Police and these are people who have been dealing with criminal elements, and they have a good feel of the pulse of the criminals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Walter Woon mentioned the point of kidnapping. We are not providing by this amendment that an offender who commits an offence of kidnapping will get mandatory death penalty. But we are saying in a situation where a group of offenders ambush the victim's car, fire off shots, they cannot claim leniency from the law. They must know that firing of a firearm has consequences. And if you talk to the Police, as I have done, they say that it is very theoretical and hypothetical to believe that the criminal in such circumstance is so logical and cool-headed that he will fire the firearm only intending it to be a warning shot. The situation in which such crimes take place is so fast-moving and so unpredictable that you do not expect a criminal to be so calculated. He must be expected to face the consequences of that situation and must have intended to have brought about the consequences if there is injury or death. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 433</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he is proposing that life imprisonment should suffice, let me point out why this is not acceptable. Prof. Walter Woon's amendment, which he is going to formally move, proposes that in such a situation life imprisonment will suffice. Let me point out, first of all, that under the Act, section 3(3) already punishes with life imprisonment and caning for an offender caught with an arm on his person while committing a scheduled offence. Therefore, his proposal will mean that the penalty should be the same, whether you had arm on you or whether you drew it out and fired it. Surely that cannot be right, that the penalty should be the same for both situations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, if you look at the penalty for trafficking in arms under the existing Act, the death penalty can be imposed for a person trafficking in arms. The trafficker in arms can be said not to have caused the death of any person or injury of any person directly. At most, he is an indirect effect. But he can get the death penalty. It seems absurd that an offender who actually discharges and commits an offence is treated more leniently. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, accomplice. As has been pointed out, an accomplice can get the death penalty. It seems odd that the person who actually fires a gun gets off more leniently. This leads me to the comments made by the others on accomplice. First, in relation to what Mr Ling How Doong has pointed out and, I think, Mr Zulkifli, if you look at the first point, this is not a new provision and it is already in the Act and has been there for many, many years. What we have done is to adjust it to refer to a new section 4A. The rest of the section has been there for a long time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ling How Doong says - how to prevent it? Easy, just don't get involved when you know one of your gang members has a gun on him, because the provision on accomplice says the court must be satisfied. That person will get the death penalty only if \"each of his accomplices present at the scene ... who may reasonably be presumed to have known that that person was carrying or had in his possession\" a gun. The court must be satisfied. If the court is not satisfied that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 434</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> he had known, thence no offence. So the best way of preventing it is not that he was in a car and he could not physically prevent it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea of this accomplice provision is: do not get involved if you know one of your gang members has got a gun. And I think that has been a salutary provision in bringing about the low incidence of guns. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Zulkifli, apart from what I mentioned, I should also point out the other safeguard is that he would not have committed an offence involving the death penalty if the accomplice proves that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the use of such arm, not after the crime is committed of course. For all practical purposes, it must be that he should have dissuaded the use of a gun before the robbery. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Can I clarify one point? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. A brief clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I raised this point simply because the Minister has said that it is to prevent an accomplice going out with somebody armed. But, then, why is it in this particular amendment it mentions the fact that \"unless he proves that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the use of such arm\"? I can understand if the provision states an accomplice will suffer the same consequence. But when you have this section incorporated, it means clearly you can go out with somebody who is armed but you must prevent him from firing. That is why I do not understand this section which says that \"unless he proves that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the use of such arm\". The Minister had earlier mentioned the fact that this is to prevent an accomplice or someone going out with somebody who is armed. Then why incorporate this section? It gives you the impression that going out with someone armed is all right. But if he wants to fire, you must prevent him from firing. That is the point I do not understand. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 435</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not sure whether he wants those provisions to be deleted. But, obviously, there must be a safeguard for the accomplice provision. It is reasonable to impose this penalty on an accomplice if he had knowledge that the offender was carrying the arm or had in his possession or under his control such arm. Next, should he suffer the death penalty? This is not a new section. It is an existing provision. So I have not changed that at all. This is what the legislature had enacted many years ago, and, I think, very wisely. He shall suffer the death penalty unless he proves that he had taken all reasonable steps to prevent the use of such arm. I think that is a reasonable position unless Mr Ling wants to remove that safeguard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. Jayakumar]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 2, line 26, to leave out \"death\" and insert \"life imprisonment\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of repeating myself, I am afraid that Mr Choo has completely misunderstood what I was saying. I am not on the side of the bad guys. In fact, the people I am concerned with are specifically victims of kidnaps and police officers when they have got resisting arrest cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree entirely with what the Hon. Minister says that most of these offences are committed on the spur of the moment and with the intent to hurt people, because otherwise you do not carry a gun. But there are certain situations, I think, where the discharge is not meant to injure anyone. If you have a situation like that, and it is a kidnapping situation, remember you have condemned the victim of the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 536</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> kidnapping to death because the kidnappers no longer have anything to lose. This is the problem. If the kidnappers have a change of heart and they say, let us surrender and let the victim go, the court has no discretion any more. It is mandatory death sentence once the gun has gone off, even if it has gone off accidentally. If they shot to kill, shot to injure, then that is not a problem. But in those situations where they did not mean to injure or to kill, you basically finish the victim off. Ditto with the resisting arrest cases. The gun goes off accidentally while they are resisting arrest. The next shot must be aimed to kill, because they no longer have anything to lose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the amendment proposed to section 4 is more than sufficient. Once you have a presumption and the defendant has to rebut that presumption, in 99 cases out of 100, he will not be able to rebut the presumption and you will have your death penalty. But in that 1% of cases, a small percentage, where it can be shown that no intention to cause death or injury was present, should there be a mandatory death penalty? This, I think, is where the Minister and I diverge. Is it the shooting per se or the intention that we are concerned with? If you say it is the discharge per see that deserves death, then, fine, the amendment should go through. If you think the discharge per se is not sufficient to warrant death but sufficient to warrant a serious punishment by life imprisonment, then I do not think the amendment as proposed by the Minister should go through. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, in addition to the points which I made earlier on why I cannot accept this amendment, let me point out that we have a parallel with the Misuse of Drugs Act. For years, we have had mandatory death penalty if a drug trafficker is caught in possession beyond 15 grams of heroin. We do not ask for the prosecution to prove that he had an intention to give this drug to so and so. It is death penalty because such a large amount of drugs cannot be for purposes of his consumption. This is well-known among drug trafficking syndicates. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 437</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> signal has gone out. So the drug trafficking syndicates know it before they try their luck in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, his argument will also mean that by 15 grams, or whatever other threshold, you are encouraging the drug traffickers to traffic in 20 grams, 50 grams, 100 grams because the punishment is the same. It does not work that way. What we want is a signal that goes out very clearly that in Singapore we have probably one of the world's toughest gun control law. That is the crux of the question. Do we want that or not to protect our society and our people? And I would urge the House to view it from that point of view. In any case, as I pointed out, if we adopt Prof. Walter Woon's amendment, it in fact makes the penalty exactly the same for a person who had it on his person when committing a scheduled offence and such a person drawing and firing it. I think it cannot be right in law, logic or in policy that the penalty should be the same. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Assoc. Prof. Walter Woon:</b> Mr Speaker, I do not think the analogy with a drug case is exact because, in the case of drugs, we are not putting at risk anyone in a sense. What I am concerned with, as I have pointed out, are those cases, like kidnapping, abduction and resisting arrest, which are in a sense unique to this kind of problem. If the Minister feels very strongly that he must punish people who just discharge the gun no matter for what purpose, then so be it. But all I am saying is that we have to think very carefully about this because, if some day, you do find that a kidnapped victim or a police officer loses his life because of this, I think that would be a very unfortunate thing indeed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think that really is in point because this is a very strong recommendation from the Police themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment negatived. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 438</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>BANKING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>2.18 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking Act was last amended in 1984 in response to the impact of the Third World debt crisis on the international banking system in the early 1980s. Many banks experienced severe losses because of heavy exposure to Third World debtors, raising concerns of a systemic collapse of the world banking system. The Banking Act amendments then were aimed at insulating the Singapore banking system from adverse developments in the international financial markets. This was achieved by strengthening prudential requirements for banks in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has since developed further as an international financial centre. The financial services sector has become an important contributor to our economy. In the first half of 1993, the sector expanded strongly by 14.6% compared to the same period a year ago. The number of internationally reputable banks with branches and merchant bank subsidiaries in Singapore has grown from 182 in 1984 to a total of 206 from 35 countries today. Their total assets have more than doubled from S$349 billion in 1984 to S$744 billion in 1992. The average daily volume of foreign exchange traded by these banks has increased eight-fold over the same period to reach US$81 billion last year, making Singapore the fourth largest foreign exchange trading centre in the world after London, New York and Tokyo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of rapid expansion, both local and foreign banks in Singapore have performed well. Total pre-tax profits of local banks rose by 13.3% in 1992 and 24.4% in the first half of this year while the aggregate pre-tax profits of foreign banks surged by almost 20% in 1992. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 439</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past decade has seen continued turbulence in many major financial markets. Immediately after the LDC debt crisis, banks in several industrialised countries again encountered problems as a result of imprudent lending for speculation in the property and stock markets in the late 1980s. They suffered huge losses when property and stock markets declined sharply as their economies went into recession. In a number of countries governments had to spend large amounts of taxpayers' moneys in bailing out insolvent banks in order to preserve the integrity of their financial systems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, financial crises have developed because lax supervision allowed fraud and mismanagement to be left unchecked. A prominent example is the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in 1991 which led to large losses for depositors and triggered a crisis of public confidence in some banking systems. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background of international financial instability, the growth of the financial market in Singapore over the past decade has been achieved with high standards of financial soundness. We have been able to avoid many of the scandals and crises that have plagued other financial markets, and have established a reputation as a properly regulated financial centre. Financial business depends critically on the confidence and trust of investors and depositors in the soundness and reputation of the institutions they deal with. Without such confidence and trust, it would be difficult for any financial market to gain international prominence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we cannot rest on our laurels. We must ensure that our financial regulations adequately address the full scope of financial risks, which are constantly evolving. In the last decade, financial deregulation and technological developments have resulted in tremendous changes to the structure of international financial markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, globalisation has led to the interlinking of the world's financial markets. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 440</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Disturbances in one market are now rapidly transmitted to other markets. This was amply demonstrated in the 1987 stock market crash when a sharp 508-point drop in the US Dow Jones Industrial Average Index triggered similar falls in major stock markets around the world. Indeed, the Singapore stock market suffered an even larger fall of 31% compared to the 22.6% drop in the US stock market during the October 1987 crash. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the world of finance has grown increasingly complex, as reflected in the increased use of sophisticated financial derivative instruments such as swaps, options and futures. The volume of outstanding interest rate and currency swaps is estimated by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) to be US$3.9 trillion as at the end of 1991. The proliferation of such derivatives has resulted in new sources of risks which financial institutions must learn to manage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interlinkage of financial markets has raised concern over systemic risks in the international financial system. Regulators recognise the need to strengthen supervision of banks and improve international coordination of regulation in order to avoid a systemic collapse of the global financial system. One result of such efforts was the recommendation of the BIS to require international banks to adhere to common minimum capital adequacy standards. This is to ensure that banks are adequately capitalised in relation to the size of their business. The BIS has also issued guidelines to enhance coordination among national bank regulators in supervising cross border activities of banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must adjust our financial regulations to keep pace with developments in international financial markets. It is therefore timely to review the Banking Act to ensure that the financial sector is able to cope with new risks as well as changes in the structure of financial markets. New provisions are required to improve bank supervision without stifling growth. At the same time, certain rules will be liberalised without compromising prudential standards. These proposals were finalised \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 441</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> after extensive discussion with the Association of Banks in Singapore and the local and foreign banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these introductory remarks, I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main proposals in the Bill, in general terms, will: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) increase the capital requirements for banks in order to strengthen their financial position; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) tighten prudential requirements on single customer limit and unsecured loans to related parties; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) lift banking secrecy to facilitate investigations under the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) allow the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to regulate the issue and operation of pre-paid stored value cards; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) remove exemptions granted to DBS Bank from complying with certain prudential requirements under the Act; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) facilitate the merger of a bank with its wholly-owned subsidiary banks. The Bill also proposes liberalisation of existing provisions to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) relax the requirement on banks to publish their financial accounts in newspapers; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) exempt banks with a small portfolio of Singapore dollar loans from complying with the substantial loans limit; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) lift banking secrecy to facilitate head office supervision of their Singapore branches and for other purposes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain in more detail the major provisions of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first major group of amendments proposed in the Bill concerns the capital requirements of banks. These appear in clause 3 of the Bill. Since 1970, local banks have been subject to a minimum paid-up capital requirement of S$3 million. This \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 442</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> amount is now grossly inadequate. Total assets of local banks have increased to S$111 billion as at the end of 1992, a growth of more than 300% over the past decade. Capital funds of these banks have also increased substantially through retained earnings as well as through new equity raised from the capital market. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reflect the growth of the banking business, it is therefore proposed that existing local banks be required to have minimum capital funds of S$800 million. Banks with capital funds below this level will be given five years to comply. Subsidiary banks of local banks will be given a longer period to meet the requirement if their parent banks are already able to comply with the new capital requirement. Generally, local banks are able to meet the new capital requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes that new locally-incorporated banks would be required to have a minimum paid-up capital of S$800 million. The reason for using paid-up capital is because such banks would not have any retained earnings or general reserves. In order to bring the capital requirements for existing and new local banks in line with each other, the Bill also proposes that existing local banks may be subject to a minimum paid-up capital requirement of S$800 million at any time from five years after the commencement of the amendment Act. This would provide sufficient time for existing local banks to comply with the requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act presently requires the head office of foreign banks to have a minimum paid-up capital of S$6 million before they are permitted to establish branches in Singapore. The Bill proposes to raise the minimum paid-up capital requirement to S$200 million in order to ensure that foreign banks which set up operations here are financially sound and adequately capitalised. This requirement will only apply to new entrants. In addition, the Bill proposes to increase the net head office funds requirement for foreign bank branches from S$3 million to S$10 million. This is to ensure that foreign banks' head offices commit adequate capital resources \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 443</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to their Singapore branches in relation to the scale of their banking operations here. Foreign banks will be given six months to comply. The grace period for any individual foreign bank may be extended, if necessary. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to require local banks to have a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12%. The capital adequacy ratio requirement was introduced by the Committee on Banking Supervision of the BIS as a measure of the adequacy of capital funds maintained by banks in relation to the level of risk of their loan and investment portfolios. Assets which carry a higher level of risk would need to be supported by a higher amount of capital. Hence, banks which engage in higher risk activities should have a commensurate amount of capital to cushion against any default or loss from such activities. The BIS currently requires banks to have a minimum capital ratio of 8%. However, this requirement covers only credit risk of banks and could be increased in future to account for other risks such as market risks of foreign exchange and equities, interest rate risks and other off-balance sheet risks. The Bill proposes that local banks be required to maintain a minimum capital ratio of 12% to ensure that they can cope with unexpected losses as well as any future increases in the capital adequacy ratio requirement by the BIS. As an indication of the importance of off-balance sheet activities, the off-balance sheet commitments of local banks account for almost 50% of their total on-balance sheet assets. Currently, local banks are able to comply with the 12% minimum capital adequacy requirement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the amendments to prudential requirements of banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a bank is not allowed to extend credit facilities in excess of 30% of its capital funds to a single customer or a group of connected customers. The amendment proposes to reduce this limit to 25% of a bank's capital funds in line with the recommendation of the BIS. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 444</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Banks would be given two years to reduce existing exposures to customers which exceed the new limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction in single customer limit should not adversely impact banks' operations or reduce the availability of credit facilities to customers as the capital bases of banks have increased substantially over the years. For example, the aggregate capital funds of local banks have increased by more than 175%, from S$4.6 billion at the end of 1983 to S$12.7 billion at the end of June 1993. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure of many banks and thrifts in the United States was partly due to imprudent lending to related parties without proper credit assessment and adequate collateral. Singapore has been able to avoid such problems because under section 29 of the Act, a bank is not permitted to grant unsecured credit facilities exceeding S$5,000 to any of its directors or any firm in which a director of the bank has an interest. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of \"firm\" however covers only sole proprietorships and partnerships but not companies. This has created a loophole for bank directors to channel unsecured lending through companies which they control. The Bill therefore proposes to amend section 29 to extend the restriction on unsecured lending to cover private and non-listed public companies in which any director of the bank owns more than 50% of the share capital or controls the composition of the board. Public listed companies and their subsidiaries are excluded because they are subject to the scrutiny of the investing public and the Stock Exchange of Singapore. Banks would be given two years to bring existing credit facilities within the new limit. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has recently enacted the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act to make the laundering of proceeds from drug trafficking a criminal offence. The Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act enables the investigation, tracing, freezing and seizure of proceeds from drug trafficking and allows legal assistance to be given to foreign enforcement agencies upon fulfilment of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 445</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> certain conditions. To implement this Act, the Banking Act would have to be amended to allow the lifting of banking secrecy provisions to facilitate drug trafficking investigations. To ensure that banking secrecy provisions are lifted only for genuine drug trafficking investigations, safeguards such as the need to establish a prima facie case of drug trafficking will be instituted. Also, assistance will only be provided to foreign authorities if this does not prejudice the sovereignty or other national interests of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next amendment concerns new provisions at section 77A in clause 20 of the Bill to regulate the issuance of pre-paid stored value cards. Such cards are a form of \"electronic cash\" and can be used by cardholders to pay for purchases of goods and services at establishments which accept the card. The issuers of pre-paid stored value cards collect moneys from cardholders in advance. Cardholders are therefore exposed to the risk of loss should the issuer become bankrupt or misappropriate the cardholders' funds. It is therefore necessary to regulate the issue of such cards to protect the public against default by card issuers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 77A, only licensed banks and POSB would be allowed to issue pre-paid stored value cards with the approval of the MAS. Unused proceeds from the issue of such cards would be subject to reserve and liquidity requirements. Pre-paid stored value cards that can only be used for payment of goods and services provided by the issuer of the cards would be exempt from such regulation. This is because the risk to cardholders in such cases is much lower. The amendment also empowers MAS to exempt pre-paid stored value cards issued before the introduction of this amendment Act from the regulation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing provisions, DBS Bank is exempt from certain prudential requirements, for example, the limit on investments, holding of immovable property and loans secured by immovable property, to enable the bank to perform its role as a development bank. DBS Bank has, however, now abandoned its role as a development bank and has expanded into Columnn: 446 all areas of commercial banking. The amendment therefore proposes to remove the exemptions granted to DBS Bank so that the bank would be subject to the same regulation as other banks. This will ensure adequate prudential control over DBS Bank. Members may wish to know that DBS Bank is presently able to comply with all these prudential requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain provisions of the Banking Act which have outlived their relevance and usefulness because of changes in business environment and banking practices will be relaxed. The first concerns the need for banks to publish detailed audited annual accounts in newspapers of the four official languages. Feedback indicates that the public does not study such information in depth and the requirement increases the banks' cost of operations unnecessarily. The Act will be amended to allow MAS to prescribe by regulation the requirements for the publication of banks' annual accounts. The intention is that banks which accept retail deposits in Singapore dollars from individuals would continue to publish their annual accounts in newspapers of the four languages. Those banks which do not accept such retail deposits, such as offshore banks, would only need to publish their annual accounts in one English language newspaper. MAS would also lay down the minimum information that banks would be required to publish. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, a bank is not allowed to grant substantial loans (ie, loans which exceed 15% of the bank's capital funds) which in aggregate exceed 50% of its total credit facilities. This is to prevent over-concentration of credit to a few large borrowers. It is proposed that banks with Singapore dollar loan portfolios of not more than S$100 million be exempted from this requirement. This is because such banks, mainly the offshore banks, which primarily engage in foreign currency wholesale lending activities would find it impractical to diversify their Singapore dollar lending to small customers. Furthermore, as the Singapore dollar loan portfolios of such banks are relatively small, the exemption from this limit would not pose a significant risk. Columnn: 447 \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the growth in importance of international activities of banks, the operations of overseas branches have an increasingly important impact on the soundness and performance of the bank as a whole. In view of this, it is important for the head offices of banks to closely monitor the operations of their overseas branches by having access to information on these branches in order to effectively manage their global risks. In addition, from the experience of the BCCI scandal, the growth of cross-border activities of banks has also underscored the need for closer international coordination among bank supervisors. Hence, it is proposed that certain aspects of the banking secrecy provisions at section 47 of the Act be relaxed or modified to accommodate these requirements. The main amendments to section 47 are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to allow the Singapore branch of a foreign bank to release information on foreign exchange, money-market and other transactions with other banks to its head office to enable the head office to monitor risks on a global basis; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to allow the Singapore branch of a foreign bank to provide information on credit facilities granted by the branch, and MAS to provide information on the operation of foreign banks in Singapore, to the supervisory authority responsible for regulating the bank's head office, provided that the supervisory authority is prohibited by its domestic law from divulging the information or gives an undertaking to MAS not to divulge the information to third parties; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to allow banks to disclose to other credit and charge card issuers information on credit and charge cardholders whose cards have been suspended or cancelled due to default on payments so as to minimise bad debts incurred by card issuers in respect of their credit and charge card business; and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 448</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to facilitate the application for a grant of probate or letters of administration by the personal representative or any person entitled to letters of administration of a bank customer who had died whether testate or intestate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces three main sections, 14A, 14B and 14C, on the merger of banks. Several local banks have wholly-owned bank subsidiaries. With increasing competition in the domestic market and the shortage of manpower, these local banks have indicated that they would like to merge with their wholly-owned bank subsidiaries to realise economies of scale and to increase productivity. However, they have pointed out that existing provisions for mergers and takeovers in the Companies Act pose considerable impediments to bank mergers, particularly in the transfer of assets and liabilities and contractual rights and obligations of the existing banks to the merged entity. Hence, the objective of the new provisions is to facilitate the merger of a bank with one or more of its wholly-owned bank subsidiaries. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions would allow a bank to apply to the Minister for Finance for approval of a merger with one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. When approval is given, all undertakings of the existing banks would be transferred to and vested in the merged bank. This would allow the merged bank to carry on business with minimum disruption and inconvenience to depositors and other customers of the bank. As the proposed new provisions only involve the merger of wholly-owned subsidiaries, the provisions in the Companies Act regarding corporate mergers for protection of minority shareholders would not be relevant in this case. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill also proposes a number of housekeeping amendments to the Act. These include the provision for MAS to issue regulations to regulate the operations of credit and charge card issuers. Presently, such power is exercised under the MAS Act. As most card issuers are banks, it would be more appropriate for such activity to be regulated under the Banking Act. It is also proposed that MAS \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 449</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be given the power to supervise the operation of the Clearing House which clears the cheques of banks' customers. As the Clearing House is an integral part of the payments mechanism of the banking system, the prudent management of the Clearing House is critical to the soundness and stability of the banking system. The provision of oversight powers to MAS is needed to ensure the efficient functioning of the Clearing House. Another amendment allows MAS to issue notices to banks on their operations. These would include notices on banks' licences, publication of accounts, maintenance of reserve requirements, provision for bad and doubtful debts and the submission of statistics and returns. Some of the other provisions are merely to give the force of law to administrative procedures and do not warrant any special mention in addition to what has been stated in reference to them in the Explanatory Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.15 pm. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>Sitting accordingly suspended</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   <i>at 2.49 pm until 3.15 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <i>Sitting resumed at 3.15 pm</i>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Ow Chin Hock (Leng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, banks are important institutions in modern economies. Banks contribute to the growth of other sectors and in turn they grow with the economy. Scandals, defaults and failures of banks have serious financial, economic and even political consequences. Apart from the notorious BCCI (Bank of Credit and Commerce International) disaster, there were also reports on problems of the banking sector in other countries, for example, the difficulties of Japanese banks in meeting BIS (Bank for International Settlements) standards in September 1990 or the so-called Black September, the troubles of American \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 450</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Savings and Loan industry, the banking crisis in Sweden, Norway and Finland due to de-regulation and supervisory shortcomings, and the problems of some Australian state banks due to over-expansion of credit. These examples and cases all underline the importance of financial prudence and discipline. They also illustrate the need for continuous regulation and supervision by central banks and other monetary authorities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) should be congratulated for refusing to give a banking licence to BCCI. The right decision has protected many Singaporeans from the big swindle. The Prime Minister had complimented MAS for its firm stand against the BCCI application in his National Day speech in 1991. As our financial sector continues to expand, and as the financial market becomes more sophisticated in terms of credit instruments and technology, the regulatory and supervisory authorities (in our case, MAS) should be more vigilant and more prepared for potential problems. The authorities must also be determined to act. While we may need to relax some of our financial regulations in response to the changing market conditions and keener competition, this should not be achieved at the risk of exposing our banking system to potential scandals and defaults. We should aim for steady growth on a sound and solid foundation. Hence, I support the Banking (Amendment) Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me know focus my comments on two areas: one, increasing capital funds of banks, and, two, information and banking secrecy. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Increasing capital funds of banks</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Banking (Amendment) Bill seeks to raise the minimum capital funds of all local banks from $3 million to $800 million within five years. On the other hand, foreign banks intending to set up branches in Singapore must have a minimum paid-up capital of $200 million in their headquarters. Clause 5 sets out the procedure for the merger of banks with their subsidiaries. Taken together, these amendments under clauses 3 and 5 \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 451</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> can be interpreted that MAS wants to increase the size of banks operating in Singapore. This is perhaps because larger banks can (1) benefit from the economies of scale; (2) compete more effectively in the regional and international market; and (3) better withstand the storm within its industry or economic recession in future. The American experience has taught us that it is better to inject more capital into the banking system where the system is doing well and when the economy is growing. When President Bush urged American banks to increase their loans and advances in order to stimulate the economy, the banks had no money. Therefore, I support the amendments in clauses 3 and 5. However, may I ask the Minister why he set the minimum capital requirement at $800 million and not higher, when nearly all our local banks have exceeded this minimum? Also, why are foreign banks which already have branches in Singapore exempted from the $200 million minimum capital requirement? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Information and banking secrecy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to information and banking secrecy. Information is an important input and a valuable asset to the financial sector. It facilitates financial transactions and improves efficiency of the financial markets. However, information concerning credit facilities, bank accounts, personal data and so on should be safeguarded and not allowed to be disclosed to unauthorised parties; otherwise, the confidence of customers will be undermined. Hence, section 47 of the Banking Act provides banking secrecy to safeguard the banks' customers. Clauses 15 and 16 of the Amendment Bill seek to amend this section. I give full support to clause 16 which introduces new provisions designed to assist in the investigation of drug trafficking offences when a bank's customer is involved. These provisions are complementary to similar provisions in the Drug Trafficking (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, as mentioned by the Minister. Moreover, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 452</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> information required under this clause can only be obtained by an application from the Attorney-General through a court order. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 allows MAS to \"inquire into any credit facilities granted to the customer by a bank\", and to exempt from banking secrecy six additional cases. The case mentioned in paragraph (h) in page 14 of the Bill is about giving information of a deceased person's bank account to his personal representative or any person entitled to letters of administration. This is a straightforward case. Another case found in paragraph (j) of the same page is about giving specific information to credit card issuers relating to a customer whose credit card has been suspended or cancelled. This may be necessary since the number of credit cards issued has increased very rapidly from 239,000 in 1984 to 1.06 million in 1992. I expect the amount of bad debt written off because of default in payment has increased over these years. May I ask the Minister to tell the House what is the amount of bad debt written off in recent years so as to give us a sense of proportion, and to justify the exemption from banking secrecy in paragraph (j). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the other exemption cases from banking secrecy in clause 15 relating to the exchange of information between branches and headquarters, within banks, between different banks, between banks and supervisory authorities, or between different supervisory authorities. This helps the supervisory authorities to detect problems earlier and to help the headquarters to better manage their branches. However, the exchange of information provided under these cases should be carried out cautiously and no information other than those stipulated in the relevant paragraphs in clause 15 should be given. This is to preserve the confidence of the customers in our banks and to maintain competitiveness of our banking system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me seek clarifications on two other clauses. Clause 20 introduces a scheme of control over the issue of stored value cards. This is perhaps in anticipation of future problems of the issuers not complying with the terms and conditions \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 453</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> under which the cards are issued, and also to avoid over-issuing of such cards. As I understand it, we have very few stored value cards now. May I ask the Minister to inform the House of the current situation and to project the future growth of stored value cards in Singapore to illustrate the necessity for this amendment under clause 20. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 6 deals with the publication of bank accounts in local newspapers. The feedback I have from the non-English newspapers is that they are not happy with this amendment. But I notice that the Minister will be moving an amendment to this clause, so I will not make further comments. I simply want to find out from the Minister how much money the banks can save per year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Thomson GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have some interest in this Bill as I was formerly working in the banking industry. I have spoken to various people in the banking industry. The general reaction I received was that they were all supportive of this Bill and they found many of the provisions very acceptable. I too would like to say that I find the provisions well conceived and well intended. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to just comment on two major provisions in this Bill. They are on the minimum requirement of capital funds and the capital adequacy ratio. I note that the definition of \"capital funds\" in this Bill for companies having their headquarters in Singapore is \"the paid-up capital and published reserves of that bank deduction having been made in respect of any debit balance appearing in the profit and loss account of the bank\". It appears to me that this definition is fairly general and may even be sometimes unclear. I could take it in accounting terms to mean shareholders' fund. I do not know whether I am right. But if it is the case, many of the large local banks would definitely have no problem in meeting this minimum capital requirement of $800 million. However, there are several smaller banks (which are not the four, five or six major banks in Singapore) which do have some difficulty in meeting this $800 million capital fund requirement. However, several of these \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 454</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> small banks are subsidiaries of major banks in bigger banking groups. For these multiple-bank groups, they would have to definitely rationalise their operations to consider whether to merge the few banks under their control into one, as now provided for in the Bill, or to spun them off as independent banks, provided they can add in the capital funds, as required under the Bill during the next five-year period. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state that the general effect of this minimum requirement of $800 million capital funds is a very strong stabilising factor for the banking community. It will create more confidence in our local banks, both domestically and internationally. However, some view that this Bill provides for a consolidation or rationalisation of the banking industry in Singapore. The minimum capital requirement of $800 million would force the banks to form into major groupings. This, while having the beneficial effect of providing a more prudent banking environment, may also pose a barrier to entry for new banks which need to have $800 million before they can form new banks in Singapore. I would like to ask the Minister whether this would restrict competition and also prevent new entrants with new ideas, new concepts and new technologies into the industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I note that, as Dr Ow has also mentioned, the Bill has defined a minimum capital requirement of only $200 million for banks whose headquarters are not based in Singapore. For some of these foreign banks, they may have been given full banking licences and therefore operate practically on the same basis as other local banks, except for the number of branches. In this case, as compared to our local banks which are required to have a capital fund of $800 million, there may in fact be a discrimination in favour of foreign banks. This could be seen to counter the allegations in the past by foreign countries that our banking laws favour and protect the local banks and discriminate against the foreign banks. Now, it appears that the opposite is so. I would like to voice my concern about the foreign banks which are able to take local Singapore dollar deposits; would not our local depositors in these foreign banks \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 455</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be less protected since their minimum capital requirement is only $200 million? In fact, they are being favoured compared to our local banks which need to have $800 million of capital funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of capital adequacy ratio, I note that the Bill has stated a minimum requirement of 12% for Singapore-incorporated banks. I understand that most local banks will have no difficulty in meeting this capital adequacy ratio. It is, indeed, a reflection of the strong and healthy state of our banks. This is most commendable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), however, lists out the minimum adequacy ratio of 8%. I presume that the BIS has come to a conclusion that 8% is generally enough for protection. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a contrast to our local banks which will have to meet a higher adequacy ratio of 12%, the foreign banks operating here which are subject to their own domestic requirements overseas may actually be operating only on an adequacy rate of 8%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister whether we are setting too high a ratio for local banks which, although is a prudent move, put them at a competitive disadvantage. Similarly, for depositors who put money in these foreign banks, would they therefore not be less protected because many depositors, especially those who are less educated, may not be aware that foreign banks may be subject to a lower adequacy ratio of only 8% whereas our local banks need to have a higher ratio of 12%. My question to the Minister is: why is it not possible, within practical reasons or international banking rules, to allow for both domestic and foreign banks to be subject to the same standards and requirements, and the same rules? Perhaps, the Minister can elaborate and explain. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by commenting that the tougher banking rules as required by the new Banking (Amendment) Bill are all very well-received and would be beneficial for the future development and growth of the banking industry in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 456</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to express my support for the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard the Minister tell the House that the last time the Banking Act in Singapore was reviewed was nearly 10 years ago because of the staggering Third World debt crisis and the tailspin that banking went into around the world. Since that time, Singapore had gone through a recession which saw our banks and the rest of the economy suffering adversely. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two consecutive years, in 1985 and 1986, the local banks saw a contraction of minus two percentage points in the capital funds and reserves. Today, our economy is again in a robust health. Singapore has matured as a financial centre and our banks are reporting double digit growth of 13% and 17%, respectively, in their reserves for 1991 and 1992. Many banks have also gone regional and some global. In terms of capital reserves, a few of our banks have surpassed OECD competitors but, sadly, they are still ranked in the worst position when it comes to risk-exposure. It is, therefore, appropriate that the issued and paid-up capitals of our banks should be raised from the currently unrealistically low levels of $3 million. Increased capitalization will enhance the corporate image of Singapore banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking (Amendment) Bill 1993 seeks to do this by increasing the capitals of our banks to $800 million. But, Sir, it is not this leap in the quantum of paid-up capitals which it seeks that will make this Bill important, but rather the quantum leap in the changes to some other areas of banking activity that it provides. I refer to the removal of some exemptions from and exceptions to be made to the existing Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to increase the capital can be met by most of the major banks in the Fourth Schedule. But even then, some may have to resort to cash calls, rights and bonus issues to meet this requirement. The smaller banks may be forced to merge or cease operation. The Bill has provisions to facilitate merger \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 457</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> which are outlined in sections 14A to 14C. It even provides for an exemption to banking secrecy for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Minister to make a final decision on whether to approve or disapprove a merger without his decision being called into question. Sir, as there are no provisions in the Bill for it, I would like to ask the Minister whether a rejected merger application can be re-submitted involving the same parties at a later date and, if so, under what circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Banking (Amendment) Bill also calls for an increase in the capital adequacy ratio to 12%. As I am given to understand, our banks are already doing this and maintaining the capital adequacy ratio at the more than 8% currently recommended by the Bank for International Settlements. Indeed, most of them keep this above the 12% proposed by the Bill and this is calculated with first-tier capitals, discounting the risks which the Minister alluded to. This new section of the Bill will, therefore, only serve to formalise an existing practice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since its incorporation, DBS Bank has been viewed as a favoured bank. The removal of exemptions for DBS Bank will be welcomed to competitors as having a more even playing field. Exceptions to banking secrecy, however, other than those which apply to laundering of drug trafficking money, will be less acceptable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are proposals in this Bill for exemptions from banking secrecy, in housekeeping activities with respect to credit given to customers and also in the regulation of Clearing Houses. Whilst the new section 47A is a necessary deterrent to drug traffickers by denying them the pleasure of their ill-gotten gains, the proposed section 54A and the power given to the Monetary Authority of Singapore to inspect the books, accounts and transactions of Clearing Houses will be viewed by the banking community as an infringement of the autonomy that they now enjoy in the management of their activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with exception to section 47A, these intrusions into banking secrecy may \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 458</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hinder the further development of Singapore as a financial centre at the time when some of our neighbouring countries are offering haven banks to foreigners. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, while the banking industry in Singapore has neither been tarnished nor scarred by the scandals and corporate failures of a magnitude that has disfigured foreign banks, we have, however, had our share of the minor blemishes and slight dents created by the occasional delinquent. If not for the vigilance and the supervision of our Government and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the situation would have been worse. The Bill will further improve banking practice here and enhance the profile of our financial institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the speakers for generally supporting the amendments to the Banking Act. There are a number of questions, some of which are overlapping, which I will take in turn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr Ow asked why the minimum capital requirement of $800 million should not be higher. At this point of time, we consider the amount adequate. Indeed, over time the minimum capital requirement will be raised but, as of now, of the six local banks, four more than adequately meet this requirement. The two smaller ones are very near this limit and should be able to attain this requirement within a year or so. This excludes the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the local banks which have much smaller capital but, in connection with the question by Mr Leong, these smaller subsidiaries would not be required to meet the $800 million requirement provided their parent banks meet the requirement. So they can ask for extensions, because their parent banks already meet the $800 million minimum requirement. And over time, we would assume that many of these banks would want to consolidate and merge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, the four largest local banks have capital funds, which include \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 459</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> shareholders' funds, well in excess of $800 million. So there is no problem in meeting this requirement in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is why are foreign banks, which already have branches here, not required to increase their capital requirement to the same level as local banks and would it place our local banks at a disadvantage. First, I must point out that foreign banks, which have branches here, are actually only branches of international banks which account for perhaps no more than 2% or 3% of their global operations. These are branches of very large international banks and up to now, our policy of admitting these banks is highly discriminatory, ensuring only banks which are amongst the top 300 in the world would be allowed to come in. So there is no question that the capital requirements of the parent banks would more than meet the $800 million requirement. But to impose this excessive amount for their branches here is unnecessary because these branches will have full access to their head office funds at any time they need them. In other words, they are fully supported by their parent banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, foreign banks, which have branches here, may have actual local capital funds which are well in excess of $1,000 million because if they want to lend substantial amounts of money, they would be required to meet the single customer limit of 25%. For example, if they have a customer who wants to borrow $50 million, they must have $200 million worth of capital before they can lend to this person. So, in fact, the actual amount of capital they have in Singapore to service their loans is already very adequate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question that Dr Ow asked was about credit cards and whether the bad debts have increased. Indeed, they have. In 1988, the total amount written off as bad debts was $5.4 million, accounting for 0.4% of total credit card billings. In 1992, the bad debts written off had increased to $24 million but it is not as bad as it looks because the amount of billings has increased substantially. So the $24 million \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 460</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> written off represents 0.6% of the total billings in view of the increase in billings. By comparison, the average write-off in US credit cards is currently 6%, so we are only one-tenth. But we have to be careful to ensure that it does not increase substantially above current levels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stored value cards, there are two types of stored value cards. One is a stored value card specific to a company which can be used only for the purchase of goods and services granted by the company. This type of stored value card is no different from buying a gift voucher. Therefore, regulation of this area is not really necessary because the risks are quite low. The area where we have to be very careful in regulating is in the issuance of what we call cash stored value cards. Such cards can be used to purchase goods from any supplier and therefore are equivalent to cash. They must be regulated because if a substantial amount of such cards are issued, it is tantamount to taking money from the public and if the card issuer goes bankrupt, or misappropriates the cash, then of course the public will lose. It is this category which requires supervision. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point raised by Dr Ow was on the question of bank account publications. The present law requires that all banks, irrespective of whether they are local banks or offshore banks, must publish their annual accounts in the newspapers of the four official languages. This is an anachronism because when the requirement was first stipulated, we did not have such a large number of offshore foreign banks as we have now. These offshore banks which are basically involved in wholesale banking in foreign currencies with non-Singapore citizens, and to require them to publish their annual accounts in four languages is, quite honestly, a waste of money. The average cost to banks is not excessive but it is money which is not well spent. For full-service local banks, the publication of the annual accounts will cost between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, depending on how much details the banks are prepared to publish. For offshore banks, the amount is about $10,000-$15,000 per bank. The total cost to all the banks currently is just \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 461</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> under $2 million. The intention is that for the future, only full-service local banks which take deposits from Singaporeans will continue to be required to publish their annual accounts in the four languages, so that all depositors will have access to the banks' statements. In the case of offshore banks, they will only be required to publish annual accounts in one English language paper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong has asked whether the new capital requirement would restrict the entry of new banks into Singapore. The answer is no. Singapore is already grossly over banked. We have a total of 35 banks with full banking licences - 13 local banks and 22 foreign banks with branches here. Thirty five full-licence banks for a small population like ours is gross over banking. I do not think this really restricts competition. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of why we are requiring local banks to have a capital adequacy ratio of 12% instead of maintaining 8% as required by BIS, the answer is very simple. The higher the capital adequacy ratio, the better for the bank. The fact remains that well-capitalised banks, eg, the Morgan Guaranty Bank in the United States, are probably more successful because high capital reserves, high capital funds, give the customer much more confidence and therefore their growth rate generally is superior. Secondly, a well-capitalised bank can also borrow at cheaper rates, issue bonds at lower rates and issue shares at lower premiums. Therefore, there is considerable advantage in having adequate capital funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Singapore banks, their actual ratios are well in excess of 12%. So the 12% requirement is conservative. And the indications are that BIS will be planning to increase the international level beyond 8% to take care of, what I call, off-balance sheet risks which I mentioned in my speech. 8% was established by BIS because if they had put 12% as a requirement, many, many large international banks would be in trouble. So it is a conservative figure which is acceptable \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 462</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> at the present time but it is likely to be raised in future, and we are merely anticipating events. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Toh has asked whether applications for mergers, if they were turned down, could be considered for appeals. The answer must be yes. There is no reason, as far as I can see, to turn down a legitimate request for merger, particularly if the subsidiaries are already wholly-owned by the banks, and it will be very unusual to refuse a merger under these circumstances. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also said that the lifting of banking secrecy, particularly in the credit card area and other areas, might lead to a reduction of competitiveness in the Singapore banking system. I can assure him that this is not the case. Information on individual accounts is generally not releasable to anyone. It is consolidated data which is required by the supervisory and regulatory authorities which would be released under specific circumstances. We are very careful on this and it is an area which we cannot readily allow our banking secrecy to be jeopardised. So he can have my assurance that this will not prejudice our competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the same thing applies to the inclusion of the clearing house under MAS supervision. It should not in any case affect the competitiveness of our system because supervision of the banking clearing house is no different from supervision of the banks themselves, and MAS has regularly inspected and supervised banks without any difficulties. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 5 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> In page 8, line 2, to leave out from \"in\" to \", a\" in line 5 and insert \"such newspaper or newspapers as may be prescribed by regulations\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained in my speech the reason for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 7 to 22 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with an amendment, read a Third time and passed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 463</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 1993 gives legislative effect to income tax changes announced in the 1993 Budget Statement, as well as other changes not announced in that Statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1993 Budget Statement, I have announced certain tax changes to promote an external wing to Singapore's economy and to attract new investments into Singapore. Members would also recall that I have announced several GST-related tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes to Promote an External Economy</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage Singapore companies to venture and invest overseas, I have announced that unilateral tax credit will be granted to facilitate the remittance of foreign dividends and overseas branch profits. Clause 33 amends section 50A to provide for this tax concession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 464</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, to promote the export of Singapore manufactured goods, double tax deduction is granted for expenses incurred in the promotion of such goods. To assist our companies to seek and exploit opportunities overseas, I have announced that this existing scheme for the promotion of export of goods will be expanded to cover services. It will also be extended to new activities, namely, feasibility studies, product certification and packaging for exports. I have also announced that double tax deduction will be allowed for exploring and developing investment opportunities abroad. Clauses 12, 13 and 15 amend sections 14B and 14C and insert a new section 14K to provide for these tax incentives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage companies to form venture capital and regional funds to promote investments in the region, I have announced that the gains and certain investment incomes of approved venture capital and regional funds will be exempt from tax. Clause 10 inserts a new section 13H for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes to Attract Offshore Activities to Singapore</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attract offshore activities to Singapore and facilitate Singapore's development into an international art and antiques market, one of the tax incentives I have announced was a 10% concessionary tax rate for approved art and antique dealers on income derived from transacting on behalf of non-residents with approved auction houses. In addition, well established auction houses and private museum operators can also qualify for the Pioneer Services tax incentive which exempts their income from tax for a period of five years. Donations to the National Museum will also be tax deductible up to twice the value of the donations. Clauses 21 and 27 amend section 37(2) and insert a new section 43L to provide for this new incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved trustee companies are currently taxed at a concessionary rate of 10% on income derived from providing specified trustee services to non-residents \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 465</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in respect of non-Singapore dollar investments. To further promote trustee services which are an important support to fund managers and investors, I have announced that the specified income of non-resident beneficiaries of trust where the trustee is an Approved Trustee Company will be exempt from tax. Clause 10 inserts a new section 13G to provide for this new incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, for a company which has some income taxable at a concessionary rate and other income taxable at the full corporate tax rate, it is allowed to set-off its loss or capital allowances under one tax rate against the profit under another tax rate on a dollar for dollar basis. This dollar for dollar set-off can result in a tax reduction which is different from that based on the tax rate at which the income is taxed. To rectify this situation, an adjustment factor will be applied whenever losses or capital allowances under one tax rate are to be set-off against the income under another tax rate. The adjustment factor is the ratio that one tax rate bears to the other tax rate. Clause 22 inserts a new section 37B to provide for this tax change. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Change to Contain Health Care Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that to contain health costs and to prevent misuse of health services, I have announced that tax deductibility of expenses on medical benefits by employers will be capped at 2% of total employees' remuneration. Clause 11 amends section 14 to provide for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>GST-Related Tax Changes Affecting Companies</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the overall tax burden remains competitive internationally when GST is introduced, I have announced that the corporate tax rate will be reduced from 30% to 27% with effect from Year of Assessment 1994. The reduced rate will also apply to non-residents, trustees and executors as well as tax withheld at source on payments to non residents. Clauses 25 and 29 amend sections 43 and 45 for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 466</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two consequential amendments are necessary as a result of the reduction in corporate tax rate. The first is to adjust the dividend franking credit mechanism. Although the reduction in corporate tax rate takes effect from Year of Assessment 1994, that is, from 1st January 1993, companies could only be informed of this after our Budget announcement. Adjustment is therefore necessary for those dividends declared in the early part of 1993, of which tax has been withheld at 30%. A transitional measure is also needed in the case of dividends declared before 1st January 1993 and received by companies with accounting periods ending before December 1993. Such dividends received are to be assessed in Year of Assessment 1993 instead of Year of Assessment 1994. Clauses 20, 28 and 30 amend sections 35(2A), 44 and 46 to provide for these changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is to cap the tax rates in Part B of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act. With the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 27%, the highest effective tax rate imposed under Part B of the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act will also be limited to 27%. This will ensure that those who are taxed under the existing Part B marginal rates, such as management corporations and clubs, will in fact not be taxed above the corporate rate of 27%. Clause 24 amends section 42(5) for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>GST-Related Tax Changes Affecting Individuals</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to the amendments to the Income Tax Act pertaining to the tax changes affecting individuals which are GST-related. I have announced that the top personal income tax rate of 33% will be reduced by three percentage points to 30%, with proportionate reductions in other tax brackets. In addition, personal relief will also be increased from $2,000 to $3,000. Clauses 23, 24 and 36 amend sections 39 and 42 as well as the Second Schedule to the Income Tax Act to effect this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reward effort and enterprise, I have also granted a 5% one-off and across-the-board rebate on personal income tax \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 467</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> payable for Year of Assessment 1993. In addition, I have also granted a $700 rebate on personal income tax payable for Year of Assessment 1994 to offset the effects of the GST. Clause 38 provides for these rebates. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Other Tax Changes Affecting Individuals</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also announced six other changes which affect individuals. Currently, our tax law allows a married woman to be separately assessed only on her earned income and income derived from accumulated earned income. I have announced that with effect from Year of Assessment 1994, married women will be allowed to elect for separate assessment on all their incomes. Clause 34 amends section 51 to enable this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a taxpayer is able to claim the tax relief for aged parents or handicapped siblings only if they stay in the same households. As some taxpayers have legitimate reasons for living apart from their aged or handicapped dependants, although they are still supporting these dependants, clause 23 amends section 39 to allow the Comptroller of Income Tax to waive the residence requirement for claiming these reliefs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a married woman can only claim the enhanced child relief for any of her children if she also claims the normal child relief for the child. I have announced the removal of this restriction and we will now allow the claim for normal child relief to be separate from the claim for enhanced child relief. Clause 37 amends the Fifth Schedule to the Income Tax Act to provide for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rationalise the tax treatment of all retirement benefits, I have announced that the maximum level of tax-free retirement benefits allowed will be pegged to the 40% compulsory contributions to CPF. Other than CPF benefits, all retirement benefits received from private employers, including gratuities and pensions, will be taxable. Clauses 3, 4, 5, and 11 amend sections 10, 10C, 13(1) and 14 to provide for these tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 468</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage a self-employed person to save more to provide for his own needs when he retires, Government has allowed tax deduction for his voluntary contributions to the CPF, subject to a limit. With the increase of the employer's CPF contribution rate to 18% from 1st July 1992, the limit for tax deduction has to be raised in tandem to 18% of the assessable income from self-employment, subject to a maximum of $12,960. This will be effective from Year of Assessment 1994. Clause 23 amends section 39 to provide for this change. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage Singaporeans to work overseas, I have announced that unilateral tax credit will be granted for foreign tax paid on employment income derived from countries with which we do not have a tax treaty. Clause 33 amends section 50A to provide for this tax concession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the Budget</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now deal with the remaining tax changes not announced in the 1993 Budget Statement. Two of them are to attract activities to Singapore. The first concerns double tax deductions which are currently granted to financial institutions for expenses relating to the establishment and development of approved financial activities in Singapore. This tax concession is now extended to include expenses incurred in engaging consultants in the research and development of approved financial activities. Clause 14 amends section 14J to provide for this extension. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment provides for a new incentive to encourage the transfer of technology through cost-sharing agreements. Currently, payments made under cost-sharing agreements are treated as capital expenses and are therefore not tax-deductible for income tax purposes. To encourage the transfer of technology as well as to attract research and development activities to Singapore, clause 17 inserts a new section 19C to allow tax deduction of payments for technology under bona-fide cost-sharing agreements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next two amendments pertain to our tax incentives for the shipping \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 469</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> industry. Firstly, clause 6 amends section 13A to extend the tax exemption currently granted to profits derived from the operation of Singapore flag ships to include the income of a shipping enterprise derived from the charter of Singapore flag ships. Secondly, clause 9 amends section 13F to extend the exemption of tax on the income of an Approved International Shipping Enterprise to income derived from the carriage of passengers, mails, livestock or goods by any foreign ship to Singapore for transhipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last three amendments are necessary to fine tune the existing provisions in our tax legislation. The first amendment pertains to the tax relief for maintaining a handicapped spouse. Currently, section 39(2)(ca) of the Act provides for a handicapped spouse relief not exceeding $3,500 to an individual who maintains a handicapped spouse or ex-spouse whose income in the year was not more than $1,500. On the other hand, any alimony received by an ex-wife, or any maintenance payment received by a wife separated from her husband in accordance with an order of court or deed of separation is income chargeable to tax under section 10(1)(e). Therefore, if such alimony or maintenance payment exceeds $1,500 a year, the income ceiling of $1,500 would be breached and the ex-husband or husband cannot claim the handicapped spouse relief. Clause 23 thus amends section 39(2)(ca) to provide that alimony or maintenance payment received by a handicapped woman who is divorced or separated from her spouse will not be deemed as income for the purpose of section 39 of the Income Tax Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment extends the period for payment of withholding taxes. Clause 29 amends section 45 to allow companies up to 10 days to pay to the Comptroller of Income Tax, the taxes which they are required to withhold under section 45 of the Income Tax Act. The period currently allowed is seven days. The extension is to take into account the non-working days in the week. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last amendment relates to the service of summonses. At present, summonses on taxpayers to attend court \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 470</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> have to be served personally. As this is both time and manpower consuming, clause 35 inserts a new section 99A to provide for service of summonses on taxpayers by registered mail. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 31 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 - \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 34, to leave out lines 1 to 7 inclusive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no longer a necessity for inserting a new section 50(12).

Clause 33 of the Bill is therefore amended to reflect this. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause read a Second time and added to the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 34 to 38 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill reported with amendments, read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 472</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read. \n  <br>4.14 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Labour (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, a CPF member is allowed to use his CPF savings to buy private residential property or one under construction by a developer licensed under the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act. He may also use his CPF to repay a loan taken out for the purchase. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 473</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, he is not allowed to use his CPF savings to finance the construction of his own house. This is because of the risk that CPF savings sunk into the project may be lost if it is not completed. On the other hand, the use of CPF savings for properties developed by licensed developers had been allowed because the Ministry of National Development regulates and enforces the Housing Developers (Control and Licensing) Act to protect the interest of house purchasers. A CPF member building a house for himself does not come under the ambit of this Act. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill before the House seeks to amend the CPF Act to enable CPF members to withdraw their CPF savings to finance construction of their own house with safeguard for the CPF fund invested in the self-construction project. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main features are in clause 3 of the Bill. It empowers the Minister to make Regulations to allow CPF members to withdraw their CPF savings to, first, repay any loan taken to finance the purchase of any land and the cost of constructing a house on the land and, secondly, to reimburse themselves the cost for the purchase of any land and the construction of a house on the land. As a safeguard, no such withdrawal will be permitted unless the construction has been completed and a Temporary Occupation Permit has been issued for the house. This will ensure that CPF savings invested in the project can be recovered since the house would have been fully completed and marketable by the time the CPF savings are released. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other clause of the Bill which I would like to highlight is clause 2. It introduces a new subsection 21(1)(ba) to enable the CPF Board to place a statutory charge on the house whose construction has been financed by CPF savings withdrawn by the CPF member. The charge is to secure the refund of the CPF savings withdrawn in the event that the member sells the house. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 474</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>LAND TITLES BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Third time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I pointed out that it was a fairly technical piece of legislation and that therefore we had undertaken considerable consultations, including with bodies like the Law Society, the Real Estate Developers Association, the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers. Nevertheless, because of the technical nature of the Bill, I decided it should be submitted to a Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee received seven written representations and heard oral evidence from three representors. They made several useful suggestions, many of which have been accepted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this House on 18th August and the Bill, as set out at Appendix I of the Report, incorporates the amendments made by the Select Committee. The explanations for all the amendments are contained at Appendix V of the Report. Therefore, I only propose to draw the attention of Members to some of the more important changes made by the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, adverse possession for unregistered land. It was suggested to the Select Committee that as the Bill will abolish adverse possession for registered land, adverse possession for unregistered land should also be abolished. A new clause 177 has been inserted to amend the Limitation Act (Cap. 163) to abolish adverse possession in respect of unregistered land in two types of cases: first, where the land is unlawfully occupied by a squatter; and second, redemption actions against mortgagees in possession. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 475</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchasers of land rarely distinguish between registered and unregistered land. Since claims to title by way of adverse possession will no longer be permissible for registered land, it follows that such claims should also be abolished for unregistered land. Furthermore, as it would take about 10 years for almost all lands in Singapore to be registered under the Land Titles Act, it would seem odd to continue this distinction between registered land and unregistered land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is limited to two types of actions which I have referred. Other actions to recover land or to enforce proprietary rights in land will not be affected. These actions must still be instituted within the relevant limitation period, otherwise they will be time-barred. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to stress that the amendment is not retrospective. It will not affect those in possession who have already acquired their title by adverse possession prior to the amendment coming into force. Nor will such persons in possession be required to apply within a time-frame to the court for an order as to their title to the land. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that should any land become registered land through the issue of a qualified certificate of title, an adverse possessor's claim to the land will remain protected only as long as, first, a caution as to title remains on the certificate of title; and, second, the adverse possessor lodges a caveat before such caution has lapsed or been cancelled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 172(9) enables persons who have, prior to the coming into operation of the Bill, established their title by way of adverse possession of registered land to apply to court for an order or to the Registrar of Titles for a possessory title. Clause 172(9) has been amended to give such persons six months instead of three months to do so as it was represented to the Select Committee that six months would give more flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, joint tenancies and tenancies in common. Clauses 53(5) and 174(f) have been amended to make it clear that \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> unilateral service of a declaration to sever is an additional means of severing a joint tenancy. Other recognised methods of severing a joint tenancy will still be applicable. This amendment is made to clarify the position because in the Select Committee it was pointed out that this was not sufficiently clear as to whether other recognised methods of severing a joint tenancy would still be applicable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, Sir, let me say that the changes are quite technical. The Select Committee is grateful for assistance given by members of the Law Society and other representors, some of whom are experts in their respective fields. I believe that the changes which are now proposed will improve the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 476</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT MOTION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>COMPULSORY TEACHING OF HOME ECONOMICS AND TECHNICAL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>STUDIES FOR ALL STUDENTS IN LOWER SECONDARY CLASSES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>4.23 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have laid claim to speak on the Motion for Adjournment today on a matter which, I believe, is of considerable importance and which I hope the Minister will look into and consider for immediate action. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I have Mr Deputy Speaker's permission, Sir, to circulate to Members a letter from the Ministry of Education? [Copy of letter circulated to hon. Members.] I ask for the indulgence of Members to prolong the sitting of this House. The matter, Sir, which I am referring to is the compulsory teaching of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 477</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Home Economics and Technical Studies for all students in lower secondary classes from 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us start from 1983. At that time, boys in lower secondary classes pursued technical studies while girls could opt for either Technical Studies or Home Economics. In that year, about 50% of the girls opted for Technical Studies in the lower secondary classes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1984, the Ministry of Education announced a drastic change in policy. The option of learning Technical Studies in the lower secondary classes was taken away from the girls and Home Economics became compulsory for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the upper secondary classes, girls could offer Technical Studies for \"N\" and \"O\" levels and boys could offer Home Economics for \"N\" and \"O\" levels. However, in 1986, only 45 boys sat for the Home Economics subject at \"N\" and \"O\" levels. Only 24 did so in 1987. Therefore, almost all the boys could not and did not avail themselves of this opportunity of offering Home Economics at \"N\" and \"O\" levels as they lacked the basic knowledge of the subject, having been denied its teaching in the lower secondary classes. Similarly, the girls did not offer Technical Studies at \"N\" and \"O\" levels. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, at present, in general, school girls learn only Home Economics and school boys learn only Technical Studies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in 1991, an enlightened and refreshing reversal of this policy was announced by Dr Seet Ai Mee. She promised that from 1994, both girls and boys in lower secondary classes will take up both Home Economics and Technical Studies. However, it appears that this promise is not going to be completely fulfilled. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will refer Members now to the first paragraph of the letter from the Ministry of Education dated 3rd March 1993: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In 1994, all Normal (Technical) pupils at Secondary 1 will learn both Home Economics and Technical Studies. This will be so at Secondary 2 as well. As for the Special, Express and Normal (Academic) course, MOE plans to implement a common Home Economics and Technical Education curriculum for all lower \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 478</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> secondary pupils when facilities are made available in the next few years. At present, these pupils offer either Home Economics (for girls) or Technical Education (for boys).\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be cognisant of the fact that only 10-15% of the cohort of primary school pupils will go to the Normal (Technical) stream. This means that 85-90% of the students of each cohort will be left out of the teaching of the combined Home Economics and Technical Studies course as they will be in the Special, Express and Normal (Academic) streams and not just in the Normal (Technical) stream. We do not know when the combined course will be made available for the large proportion of students. The Ministry of Education says that it will happen in the next few years but Dr Seet Ai Mee promised in 1991 that this would materialise in 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister why we have not kept to the schedule that was announced in 1991 that full implementation would take place in 1994. We had three years to train teachers and to build the infrastructure but we have apparently not done so. We have lost valuable time as we did not prioritize our tasks and projects. The purpose of the announcement of the change of policy three years ahead of time was to ensure implementation by 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate on why the teaching of the common course of Home Economics and Technical Studies is so important. With the changing economic scene in Singapore, over 50% of our women are in the workforce. Women should do Technical Studies. Our workforce of the future has to be technically literate so that we can make the transition to the value added skilled industries. Also in 1991, Dr Seet Ai Mee said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore's changing social norms mean that men and women will now have to play complementary roles in managing the home.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that the change in curriculum was necessary \"as wives no longer just stayed at home and looked after the house while their husbands went out to work. .... A Home Economics programme for girls and boys will pave the way towards shared responsibility in the home.\" Also, Home Economics has a far wider influence \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 479</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> nowadays as its scope has broadened from the old components of cooking, sewing and housekeeping. \"The Home Economics syllabus has been extended to include conservation and care of the environment\", Dr Seet Ai Mee said. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides Dr Seet Ai Mee, other important bodies have made similar recommendations to change the mindset and attitudes of Singapore males so that they will begin to share domestic and parenting responsibilities with their parents. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, the Manpower subcommittee of the Economic Committee suggested the implementation of \"changes in the educational system to promote the virtues of sharing housework.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, Mr Wong Kan Seng, in his keynote address to the 3rd General Assembly of the ASEAN Confederation of Women's Organisations, encouraged men to assume their new role in sharing responsibility in raising a family. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989, our late Dr Tay Eng Soon, in his opening speech at the 5th Biennial Conference of the ASEAN Regional Association of Home Economics, said men must change from \"The attitude that their role is simply to go out and earn the income and they can leave everything else, including bringing up the children to their working wives is simply not good enough any more. They have to help around the house and be involved with their children.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in 1989, the Advisory Council on Youth called for \"Schools to teach children the importance of preparing for their future roles as spouses and responsible parents.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these authorities quoted are heavyweights and cannot be mistaken or ignored. So let us heed their call. Let us start preparing our young men for their future role as husbands and fathers by teaching them Home Economics in school. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have our Prime Minister just recently voicing his concern over trends that show an increasing proportion of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 480</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> single women and a declining number of children per married woman. Unless and until we institute attitudinal changes in society towards shared parenting and housework, we will not be able to reverse the worrying trends mentioned by our Prime Minister. The education system and the school environment are best placed to effect changes in these attitudes. The introduction of Home Economics to boys would be a step in the right direction. Our boys urgently need to learn the skills of being a homemaker and a parent. Girls often learn these skills on their jobs at home, even if they are not taught Home Economics in school. Yet we persist in teaching this subject to girls and not to boys whose need is more acute. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have lost enough time. If we wish to correct some of the trends which will weaken the family building block, then it is time to set our hearts and minds on this crucial issue as promised in 1991. We also have to upgrade the technical skills of the female labour force. Therefore, we must institute the learning of the common Home Economics and Technical Studies course for all students. We have to start training the teachers and getting the infrastructure ready today so that we are all set for 1994. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Ker Sin Tze):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Dr Soin for her motion and we agree with her that it is important to introduce Home Economics and Technical Studies to our school system. The Ministry has been working very hard since Dr Seet Ai Mee's announcement in 1991. We have decided that, in 1994, a common Home Economics and Technical Studies curriculum will be introduced to Secondary One students in the Normal (Technical) course. Students will continue to take the subject at Secondary Two because it is a two-year course. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Ministry is also doing all that is necessary to equip more schools with adequate technical workshops and home economics rooms for the subject to be introduced to the Normal (Academic) course in 1996 and to Special and Express course students in 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 481</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Soin has asked why it has taken such a long time, three years, to prepare the course. We have to construct physical facilities such as the home economics rooms and also technical workshops in order that the course can be introduced. These involve the modification and addition of structures which will have to go through the normal process of application for approval to change, and these would take time. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the course will be divided into phases. We will first introduce the course to students in the Normal (Technical) stream, then to the Normal (Academic) stream, and finally to the Special and Express students. So the Ministry has not forgotten what it has \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 482</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> announced and it is continuing to work hard to expedite the introduction of the course. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I say something in Mandarin? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ADJOURNMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Adjourned accordingly at\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   Twenty-three Minutes\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"right\">\n   to Five o'clock pm.\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 483</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>GENDER OF JUNIOR COLLEGE STUDENTS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Education if he will provide the gender breakdown of students in junior colleges in the various streams, eg.

If it is established that a licensee has contravened any of the provisions of the Act, its Rules, or conditions of the licence, section 11 of the Employment Agencies Act empowers the Commissioner for Labour to revoke the licence. The same penalty applies if the licensee is found to have conducted his employment agency business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the interests of his clients. The licensee's security deposit may also be forfeited \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour (MOL) takes a very serious view of violations of the law or regulations by any employment agents. Since March 1992, more than 10 employment agents have had their licences revoked and their security deposits forfeited. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To regulate more effectively the employment agencies in Singapore, MOL recently announced a revised set of Employment Agency Rules. These Amended Rules took effect on 1st August 1993. One significant change is the increase in the security deposit, from $10,000 to $20,000. Amongst other things, the amended Rules also allow the Commissioner for Labour to make enquiries regarding persons who may have an interest in the grant or renewal of a licence, whether or not such persons are joined in the licence application. A licence will not be issued if the Commissioner finds the applicant or an interested party unsuitable, such as in the case of undischarged bankrupts, those convicted of offences like fraud, or in cases where it is considered in the public interest not to grant a licence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a licence is revoked for any reason, the licensees and directors of that agency will be prevented from obtaining any agency licence in the future, even under a different agency name. This is because anyone who has had an interest in an agency which had its licence revoked is deemed unsuitable to operate an employment agency, and hence would not be issued with a licence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 493</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>AIDS SCREENING ON WORK PERMIT HOLDERS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Kanwaljit Soin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. \n  <b>Dr Kanwaljit Soin</b> asked the Minister for Health what is the rationale for carrying out AIDS screening on work permit holders only and not on employment pass holders. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has been monitoring the trend of AIDS in Singapore closely.

On the other hand, the number of infected employment pass holders has remained negligible. While there is no need to extend AIDS screening to employment pass holders, the Ministry will continue to monitor the situation closely.   \n </body>\n</html>", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
