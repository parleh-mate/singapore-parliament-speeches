If the\r\nCOV is taken into account, I think the price of a 3-room flat would\r\nbe quite similar to the prices for 4- and 5-room flats.

The highest COVs are often paid\r\nby the former private property owners, especially those who sell\r\ntheir private properties in en bloc sales. Probably with a lot of\r\ncash and still needing a roof over their heads, they are the ones\r\nwho bid up the COVs. Let us not unfairly blame a particular group\r\nfor forcing higher prices in the resale market.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f8070fe2-4c3d-4954-a45e-e046813cd57b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-41b21e87-2a23-41f7-8367-6abcef20f656__id-f8070fe2-4c3d-4954-a45e-e046813cd57b\"><!--a--></a>The bottomline is this:\r\nwe are familiar with the problem.

In the development of the Sports Hub, we knew that\r\nit was a very significant project that involved not just the construction\r\nof a new National Stadium. More important than just the infrastructural\r\ndevelopment, we were very concerned that we should bring in the\r\nexpertise to run the whole project in terms of the programming subsequent\r\nto the completion of the project. In this, we want to make sure\r\nthat whoever runs the project for the programming portion, has the ownership\r\nto make sure that they do their best and this is why we have structured\r\nthe scheme such that for every year after the project is completed,\r\nas they run the programmes, we will reward them or we give them\r\nthe Unitary Payment according to their ability to bring in programmes\r\nfor us.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-0583c770-5965-4c75-982d-fdd66e86aab9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ef463e92-8919-4ece-b942-5c7fafe4e855__id-0583c770-5965-4c75-982d-fdd66e86aab9\"><!--a--></a>While we have very good\r\nfinancial standing amongst the community, this may not be the only\r\nfactor that we consider. So, for example, what we have seen now\r\nafter the initiation of the Sports Hub project is that, while they\r\nare building the infrastructural part of the Sports Hub, they have\r\nalready commenced the programming component to bring in some of\r\nthe big sports events. Some of these sports events require a long\r\nlead time to do so. So, we will be quietly confident that once the\r\nproject is completed in 2014, not only will the stadium and the\r\ninfrastructure facilities be ready, more importantly, the rest of\r\nthe programming in terms of bringing in events will also run concurrently\r\nto meet the schedule and the expectations that we have set for them.\r\nSo, it is on this basis that beyond the financing cost, we have\r\ngone for a public-private partnership in order to bring people with\r\nthe expertise to run some of these programmes and to bring in some of\r\nthese mega events to fully utilise the capacity of the new arena\r\nbeyond what we ourselves may be able to do, by ourselves.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n         </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"hansardContent\" xmlns:notusv=\"http://mekon.com/notus/versions/1.0/\">\r\n         <p class=\"column\">Page: 806</p>\r\n         <h1 class=\"title topictitle1\"> Service Standards for Public Transport Operators<!--topictitle--></h1>\r\n         <div class=\"body hansardBaseBody hansardContenteBody\" id=\"id-95e3c47e-5503-4b03-89b1-fe6ac607b795\">\r\n            <a name=\"id-95e3c47e-5503-4b03-89b1-fe6ac607b795\"><!--a--></a>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcQuestion\" id=\"id-7728e2b2-2a31-4677-b955-29c638185a07\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-7728e2b2-2a31-4677-b955-29c638185a07\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-05cfef42-deba-42d5-813e-5ee312a0f5b0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-05cfef42-deba-42d5-813e-5ee312a0f5b0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcQuestionNumber\">4</span><span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Hri Kumar Nair</strong>\r\n                  </span> asked\r\nthe Minister for Transport (a) how does the Public Transport Council\r\n(PTC) determine the penalties to impose on public transport operators for\r\nfailure to meet service standards;

These\r\ncover a comprehensive range of 20 requirements that focus on areas\r\nimportant to commuters' travel experience. Examples of these requirements\r\ninclude adherence to bus trip schedules, minimum service frequency,\r\nmaximum allowable bus loading levels, and bus breakdown and accident\r\nrates, amongst others. The detailed requirements stipulated by the\r\nQoS standards are publicly available on PTC's website.

The operators cannot therefore attempt\r\nto reduce costs by compromising the quality of their services, as\r\nthey try to increase profits under our fare-cap regime. The end\r\nresult is that the operators are incentivised to contain costs while being\r\nrequired, by regulation, to maintain good service levels. In view\r\nof its important role, the PTC regularly reviews the QoS standards\r\nto ensure that they remain relevant and appropriate.

Since he has raised\r\nthe question, it would be useful to share with Members a little\r\nbit more about the kind of standards that the operators are required\r\nto meet. I mentioned earlier that there are 20 requirements in the\r\nstandards. Let me just share one of the standards so that Members\r\nhave a sense of what the operators are required to do.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9184b012-9708-46a7-9995-d13b94ef9190\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-9184b012-9708-46a7-9995-d13b94ef9190\"><!--a--></a>Standard 1.2, for example,\r\ntracks whether buses stick to their scheduled departures from the\r\nterminals or the interchanges. There is an allowance of five minutes\r\ngiven for each bus that is supposed to leave according to schedule.\r\nAnd not less than 85% of the departures must be within this five-minute\r\nallowance. So that is one standard. And when we look at the service\r\nfailures, this is one of the more frequent standards that they fail\r\nto meet. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-df4527b4-405d-43d6-8b34-0275110d24c6\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-df4527b4-405d-43d6-8b34-0275110d24c6\"><!--a--></a>Another standard, that is\r\nalso useful for us to know more about, monitors bus availability.\r\nFor example, standard 4.4. There are several sub standards in standard\r\n4.4. One of them states that 100% of all bus trips must attain headways\r\nof not more than 30 minutes. So, all bus services must come within\r\n30 minutes. Off-peak, more than 85% must come within 20 minutes.\r\nAt peak hours on the weekdays, if they are basic bus services, more\r\nthan 80% must be within 10 minutes and if they are feeder buses,\r\nmore than 90% must be within 10 minutes. So that is standard 4.4,\r\nthat monitors and tracks availability for the different bus services\r\nat different times of the day, and whether they are feeder buses\r\nor basic bus services. This set of standards was introduced in 2006\r\nand they have consistently been reviewed and also tightened progressively.\r\nThe QoS standards were last tightened in August 2009. For example,\r\nfor standard 4.4 for feeder buses, before August 2009, we only required\r\n85% to come within 10 minutes and then from August 2009, we raised\r\nit to 90% within 10 minutes.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 809</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-95e6cd1f-bd1d-40fa-9be0-7b8bad424d38\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-95e6cd1f-bd1d-40fa-9be0-7b8bad424d38\"><!--a--></a>Mr Nair's second question was: are these\r\npenalties meaningful; are they of the right amounts? It is a very\r\nrelevant question and something which the PTC also looks carefully at.\r\nThe purpose of the framework really is to spur improvement and it\r\nis useful to see if indeed it has helped to do so. To share with\r\nMembers of the House \u2013 in the first full year of the penalty framework\r\nbeing introduced, which was in October 2007, between the period\r\nDecember 2007 and November 2008, there were more than 100 instances\r\nof non-compliances. More than 100 instances of non-compliance for\r\nwhich the PTC then levied penalties on the operators. This created\r\nconsiderable pressure on the operators. They had to buck up and\r\nmake sure that by the next six monthly review, they would do better. And\r\nso, as it turns out, for the second and third full years since implementation\r\nof the penalty framework, the number of non-compliances fell to\r\nbelow 10 in each of those years. In the fourth year, which is the\r\nperiod that we are talking about, in the first six months, there\r\nhave been exactly 10 instances of non-compliance, and so, it is\r\nan uptrend.

First, on how the PTC\r\nsatisfies itself that, indeed, the performance standards that the\r\noperators are required to meet, have been met. In fact, all the\r\noperators have computerised fleet operations and management systems.\r\nEvery month, these performance reports are drawn from the databases\r\nand they are submitted to the PTC. There is quite a lot of data, which\r\nis why the PTC takes six months to go through all of them. There\r\nis also an audit trail. The PTC regularly audits the reporting processes\r\nand the systems to ensure that the instances of non-compliance are\r\nproperly captured. I would like to assure the Member that there\r\nis a proper system for doing so. Of course, as an additional layer\r\nof checks, the PTC also conducts multiple on-site spot checks every\r\nmonth to ascertain that the performance data actually matches commuters'\r\nexperience on the ground. So, I would like to give the Member that\r\nassurance.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 810</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cfa9257c-48a7-4604-970e-5955b0f2d150\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-551ea75f-a6a0-4a65-860f-633461e4a189__id-cfa9257c-48a7-4604-970e-5955b0f2d150\"><!--a--></a>To her question on bus contestability:\r\nas part of the Land Transport Masterplan, it is indeed the intention\r\nfor us to move towards greater contestability.

Even though the\r\namounts seem to be small, by tracking those numbers, we know whether\r\nthe operators have responded. If they do not take it seriously,\r\nit does not mean that we have no other avenues of making our views\r\nknown to them; it does not mean that we have no other avenues of\r\nasking them to improve.

The measures are\r\nput in place to tighten both the quality of the foreign workers\r\nand foreign talent coming into Singapore. We are also putting in place\r\nmeasures so that it levels the playing field. These measures will\r\ntake effect in the coming months and years. But there are many other\r\nmeasures that are put in place to facilitate the maintenance of\r\nemployment. For example, in the 2008 crisis, we put in place various\r\nmeasures including the Jobs Credit Scheme which was very significant.\r\nIn fact, I think we had done fairly well in making sure that despite\r\nthe very serious economic crisis globally, we had managed to maintain\r\ngood employment numbers. Employment did go down but in the overall\r\ncontext of things, we maintained fairly good employment numbers,\r\nand kept unemployment relatively manageable. Some of the measures\r\nput in place had enabled the economy to grow. The important thing\r\nis that having economic growth allows jobs to be created and to\r\nbe maintained for our people. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7eb7e762-44c2-4080-932a-7527c42f32b9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c55fbd6e-cd95-4d10-a196-75daf967c00a__id-7eb7e762-44c2-4080-932a-7527c42f32b9\"><!--a--></a>Going forward, we would\r\ncontinue to track carefully.

Local companies\r\ncan choose to stay here or to go somewhere else where perhaps costs\r\nare cheaper and more competitive. In the same way, foreign companies\r\ncan choose to go to other countries as well because it is very competitive.\r\nHowever, many of our companies do base themselves here and grow\r\nfrom Singapore to beyond, and many companies actually do come to\r\nSingapore to invest, setting up regional headquarters and so on.\r\nAll these create jobs for Singaporeans. This is something we are\r\nmindful of. It allows the economy to grow but at the same time we\r\nalso recognise that there are externalities. So, depending on the\r\nsituation, we would have to moderate, as we are doing now, the growth\r\nof the foreign workers and talent in Singapore.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-095e6c8b-6637-46c4-889c-481f9f8efbba\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-c55fbd6e-cd95-4d10-a196-75daf967c00a__id-095e6c8b-6637-46c4-889c-481f9f8efbba\"><!--a--></a>As retrenchments take place,\r\na range of people will be retrenched.

On\r\nbalance, what we are quite particular about is that economic growth\r\nand ensuring companies grow and do well will continue to allow jobs\r\nto be created for Singaporeans.

For example, when we were attracting animation\r\ninvestments into Singapore, these investments did take place very\r\nquickly. The lead time for bringing in these investments is quite\r\nshort and so we did not have enough time to send Singaporeans to\r\nuniversity and for overseas attachments to build up the skills base.\r\nIn such situations, of course, we do allow the companies to bring\r\nin foreign talent and workers first to start the investments in\r\nSingapore, and then we will produce the pipeline of Singaporeans\r\nto take these jobs.

The parent relief\r\nrecognises the role of children in supporting their parents in old\r\nage. The relief is granted as a fixed dollar amount with respect\r\nto each elderly person who is a parent, regardless of how many children\r\nhe has. The dollar amount is fixed, as it would be inequitable for\r\nfamilies with more children to enjoy a larger benefit than those\r\nwith fewer children. An elderly person with no children also enjoys\r\nno such benefit. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-45f100a5-683c-4874-8de4-e76f19bdd34f\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-7e534892-f297-46a6-9ab4-7ed111f6485e__id-45f100a5-683c-4874-8de4-e76f19bdd34f\"><!--a--></a>Extending the fixed dollar\r\nrelief to more children means that each claimant would only have\r\na fractional share of the available relief. In practice, this would\r\nraise many difficulties in implementation. Often the duty of caring\r\nfor the parent is shared in various ways among children and their\r\nspouses, and sometimes grandchildren as well. Depending on the circumstances\r\nof each family, care can be given in monetary or non-pecuniary forms\r\nand may not be easily quantifiable. There will be practical challenges in\r\napportioning the parent relief in an equitable manner. Further,\r\nan equal apportionment to all involved may result in not a very\r\nmeaningful amount of relief, including for the child who may be\r\nthe most significantly engaged in supporting the parent. Nonetheless,\r\nthe Ministry of Finance will study this idea further and engage\r\nin consultations to see if it can be implemented practically.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-906ec1a3-bd46-42a8-9d24-83d6a367e619\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-7e534892-f297-46a6-9ab4-7ed111f6485e__id-906ec1a3-bd46-42a8-9d24-83d6a367e619\"><!--a--></a>In Year of Assessment 2010,\r\nabout 151,000 taxpayers claimed a total of $1.16 billion of parent\r\nrelief. This cost the Government about $106.4 million in tax revenue\r\nforegone. As for the Member's question on extending parent relief\r\nto all children, there will be minimal tax revenue impact if the\r\nproposal is to share the current quantum of parent relief among\r\nall children. However, the revenue impact will be significant if\r\nevery child or grandchild can each claim the full amount of relief\r\nfor supporting his parent or grandparent. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-347bb8c1-25e8-4e12-aeae-924878574be7\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-7e534892-f297-46a6-9ab4-7ed111f6485e__id-347bb8c1-25e8-4e12-aeae-924878574be7\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6c9d42e5-c5f4-448c-887b-91ab0ef66e60\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-7e534892-f297-46a6-9ab4-7ed111f6485e__id-6c9d42e5-c5f4-448c-887b-91ab0ef66e60\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Patrick Tay Teck Guan (Nee Soon)</strong>\r\n                  </span>:\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister of State a supplementary\r\nquestion.

One of the eligibility criteria\r\nfor the relief is that the child must be financially dependent.\r\nA dependent child is one who does not have more than $4,000 of annual\r\nincome.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 820</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9cf8c284-d0cb-4f69-affc-1e8d59c28a04\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-df899378-0d0a-4a02-bd70-3646371d51a6__id-9cf8c284-d0cb-4f69-affc-1e8d59c28a04\"><!--a--></a>It is unrelated to National\r\nService (NS) \u2013 whether serving NS, or working, or studying in an\r\neducation institution whilst working part-time; a child who has\r\nincome above $4,000 a year will not qualify as a dependant for the\r\npurpose of claiming the relief.

I thank the Minister of State for her answer.\r\nI understand the purpose and logic of the relief. The problem is\r\nthat the relief is up to $10,000 for working mothers and a man who\r\nenters into National Service earns about $4,000 or so. So the upshot\r\nis that a working mother is financially worse off if her son disrupts\r\nhis studies and enters National Service. While I understand the\r\nlogic of the relief, there is some inequity because, certainly,\r\nthe relief is still available if the working mother has a daughter.\r\nSo will there be some sort of relief to address that inequity?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-cbfa29ff-4279-4f7b-8d95-e3584f0d7cf6\">\r\n               <a name=\"id-df899378-0d0a-4a02-bd70-3646371d51a6__id-cbfa29ff-4279-4f7b-8d95-e3584f0d7cf6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f8012fc9-3706-4a5d-a73c-3be924e5dc8c\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-df899378-0d0a-4a02-bd70-3646371d51a6__id-f8012fc9-3706-4a5d-a73c-3be924e5dc8c\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Josephine Teo</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Speaker,\r\nSir, it really depends on what the daughter is doing.

I think the basic issue here\r\nis one of vacancies or places available in the childcare centres\r\nfor us to provide mothers with opportunities so that they can go\r\nto work. As Members know, currently, we are already ramping up our\r\nefforts to increase the number of childcare centres. Under the plans\r\nthat we have for the childcare development for the whole sector,\r\nwe have already built almost up to 200 centres, way ahead of the\r\ntime that we have set. But even then we know it is not enough. So\r\nit is a question of prioritisation, ie, prioritising the needs of\r\nmothers who are working and who need to place the children in the\r\nchildcare centres as against mothers who are not working and who\r\ncan take care of the children at home. But notwithstanding that,\r\nwe do also provide opportunities for mothers who, although are stay-at-home\r\nmothers, need to place the children in childcare centres because\r\nof specific reasons, like long-term illness, disability or the need\r\nto take care of a family member who is very ill. So there are exceptions\r\nthat we will make in those situations.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3eb2a0db-5fce-46e1-acb6-740f9a4a35a1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-d26983d9-6f59-45e3-84dc-e915ec0dc010__id-3eb2a0db-5fce-46e1-acb6-740f9a4a35a1\"><!--a--></a>With regard to Ms Low's\r\nquestion about whether we could provide an allowance for stay-at-home\r\nmothers, I think the logic and the rationale are the same, and that\r\nis, we should consider providing support for mothers who are working\r\nand for mothers who are not working and staying at home. And we\r\nare fully sympathetic as we know that stay-at-home mothers have\r\ngiven up their careers in order to fully focus on taking care of their\r\nchildren. But there are resources that we need to think of in terms\r\nof how we allocate our resources.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c06bce54-6e7d-4f9e-b511-b764cc7ad392\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-d26983d9-6f59-45e3-84dc-e915ec0dc010__id-c06bce54-6e7d-4f9e-b511-b764cc7ad392\"><!--a--></a>With regard to all mothers,\r\nregardless of whether they are stay-at-home mothers or they are\r\nworking mothers, they benefit from the Baby Bonus that the Government\r\ngives.

These downturns\r\nhad the effect of depressing income growth for all Singaporeans,\r\nin particular for workers in the lower income group. In the second\r\nhalf of the decade, the economy grew faster and we saw real incomes\r\ngrow. For Singaporeans at the 20th percentile, real incomes grew\r\nby 3.1% annually from 2006 to 2010. This was, in fact, higher than\r\nthe growth in median incomes of 2.6% per annum during the same period. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cfbabd90-020e-471c-87d9-7ec3b849e567\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ca21234e-6e66-4cea-815a-054ddcc6b6f4__id-cfbabd90-020e-471c-87d9-7ec3b849e567\"><!--a--></a>It is therefore not correct\r\nto say that real incomes have not increased despite initiatives\r\nsuch as skills upgrading and job redesign. It was during the latter\r\nhalf of the decade that we introduced schemes like Skills Programme\r\nfor Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR), and NTUC and its partners stepped\r\nup efforts to help upgrade jobs at the lower end of the income scale.\r\nFurther, older low-income workers began receiving Workfare from\r\nthe Government, which would have given many of them an average of\r\n10% increase in their annual income. This had not been factored\r\nin the 3.1% per annum real growth in their pay.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-06e763cd-1786-4cef-81ee-fa8352ea73c3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"id-ca21234e-6e66-4cea-815a-054ddcc6b6f4__id-06e763cd-1786-4cef-81ee-fa8352ea73c3\"><!--a--></a>What this also shows, importantly,\r\nis that good, sustainable economic growth is a plus for all Singaporeans,\r\nand especially so for those in the lower income group.

More often than not, we need our Ministers\r\nto hit the ground running. We do not have the luxury to mentor our\r\njunior Ministers all the time. We also realise that the Minister's\r\nresponsibility is deeper, wider and includes constituencies, if you will, outside Singapore.\r\nFor example, the Foreign Minister's portfolio includes \u2013 countries\r\nfriendly or not at different times relevant to Singapore's space\r\nin the world; the Trade Minister's constituency of Trading Blocs\r\nor areas outside of Singapore that will add or detract from our\r\npath of survival.

Consider this, someone who has earned his stripes\r\nin the corporate world, it would follow that their compensation\r\nand lifestyle might also include having a mortgage and commitments\r\nto the family. The difference may make it difficult at that point\r\nfor the family to meet the financial commitments, for example, to\r\ntheir children's education. These commitments are on-going and comfortably\r\nmet by their existing remuneration. I would imagine many will simply\r\nsay a polite \"no thank you\". They will probably then serve on their\r\nown terms and leisure and contribute to the society and not to look\r\ntowards running a country. To be fair to these persons, I do not\r\ndoubt that they have a willingness to serve, but the practical aspects\r\nto make the move cannot be mitigated at that point of time. I am worried\r\nabout this. This has a tremendous impact on the well-being of Singapore.\r\nThis is a problem that the government of the day will face \u2013 whether\r\nPAP or not.

The advent\r\nof the Internet and the mushrooming of social media are paving the\r\nway to many raising questions about everything in China. Some questions underlie a lack of\r\nconfidence in the integrity of their public officers. For example,\r\na director of state land draws a monthly salary of about 12,000\r\nRMB (about S$3,000), yet in the Chinese social media, they asked,\r\nhow is he able to afford a Swiss watch on his wrist costing about\r\n400,000 RMB (or S$80,000)?

This is a concept that some financial institutions\r\nintroduced in the wake of the last financial crisis to discourage\r\ntheir senior executives from pursuing short-term results at the\r\nexpense of consistent performance over the long term. Only a portion,\r\nperhaps one-third, of the Ministers' National Bonus and performance\r\nbonus should be paid out at the end of each year, and the rest deposited\r\ninto a separate account. If, in subsequent years, performance is good,\r\ntheir bonus bank balance will grow. However, if performance fails to\r\nmeet targets at any one year, there should be a claw-back which\r\ndeducts from their bonus bank balance. At the end of the term of\r\ngovernment when Parliament is dissolved, the Ministers will get\r\npaid what remains in their bonus bank account. If, say, performance\r\nhas been good in the first year of government but poor in subsequent years,\r\nthe Minister could potentially lose all that is in his or her bonus\r\nbank account.

But on the other hand,\r\nhow many countries in the world have the kind of political system\r\nthat is so unusually clean, serious and fruitful?

In my previous role in\r\nthe Labour Movement, I had great respect for my colleagues, especially\r\nthe Industrial Relations Officers. The IROs keep long hours. They\r\nare often caught in the crossfire between the workers and the employers.\r\nIt is emotionally draining. Many of the meetings with union leaders\r\ncan only take place after usual work hours. Most events to bring\r\nmembers together are held on weekends. This impacts their family\r\nlives. It is a tough job. Without passion and willingness to serve,\r\nIROs cannot last long.

The article is written by Mr Koh Chin Yee. He felt that in\r\nthis world today, the most important is the heart of the people.\r\nI agree. To any successful government, talent is very important, but the heart\r\nof the individual is even more important. However, no government\r\ncan function effectively without both of them. What will happen\r\nto the livelihood and welfare of the people if one of them is lacking\r\nin the government? I am sure we all know the answer in our hearts.\r\nHence, money should not be the reason for getting talents to enter\r\npolitics, but it also should not be the reason for losing the talents. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2e7a673f-3d9c-4c7f-b19b-84031acc34b1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-2e7a673f-3d9c-4c7f-b19b-84031acc34b1\"><!--a--></a>Mr Speaker, Sir, in history,\r\nwe have seen many rulers who sought talents. Liu Bei went to see\r\nZhu Ge Liang three times, braving snow and rain, because he wanted\r\nto secure the services of Zhu Ge Liang. Liu Bei's sincerity finally\r\nmoved Zhu Ge Liang, who agreed to help him. Zhu Ge Liang gave his\r\nall to serve his country, his spirit became an exemplary model for\r\nothers, and his story became an important chapter in human civilisation.\r\nWhat moved Zhu Ge Liang to accept Liu Bei's proposal was his sincerity.\r\nThe Singapore Government's sincerity in attracting talent is no\r\nless than Liu Bei's. However, just sincerity and high pay cannot\r\nattract enough talent to join the Government. From what we can see\r\nin the May elections last year, where the number of candidates from the\r\nlabour movement and civil service surpassed those from the private\r\nsector, attracting well-rounded talent to join the Government is\r\nsomething that the Government needs to work on. Hence, whatever\r\nway is required to attract talents, we should not brush them aside\r\nlightly. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 865</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-e1e6ae4d-6ab8-4e35-99f6-df5aa3af715e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-e1e6ae4d-6ab8-4e35-99f6-df5aa3af715e\"><!--a--></a>According to the Confucian\r\nethics book of filial piety, in the whole of heaven and earth, a\r\nperson is the most precious.

A quotation from\r\nthe book that left a deep impression on me is, \"If you have talented\r\npeople, the country will prosper. If you lose talented people, the\r\ncountry will collapse\". What it means is, if you have the talents,\r\nthe country will prosper. If you do not have the talents, the country\r\nwill not do well. Going back to ancient Chinese history, the Tang,\r\nSong, Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties had all experienced periods\r\nof prosperity because they had abundant talent.

So, identifying the right\r\ntalent, grooming the right talent using the right talents and allowing them\r\nto utilise their potential to the fullest is the key reason why\r\nSingapore is able to develop from a fishing village to a modern\r\nmetropolis.

This\r\nis a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. Public service is a\r\ncalling.

The Review Committee sought to correlate Ministers\r\nto talent in Singapore, and therefore recommended that Ministerial\r\nsalaries be pegged at the top 1,000 income earners here. I feel\r\nthat by expanding the pool to benchmark against the 1,000 income\r\nearners here, it is a lot more palatable than just the 48 income\r\nearners that we had been using in the past. At least at the 1,000th\r\npeople level, we may statistically better capture the variance of\r\nsalaries of Singapore's top talent from year to year. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 871</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d17437a5-0734-45a2-9f7b-88abee840c4b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-d17437a5-0734-45a2-9f7b-88abee840c4b\"><!--a--></a>However, even this round,\r\nthe Committee suggests a 40% discount to the median salary of the\r\ntop 1,000 earners, reflecting the difficulty of finding the right\r\nbenchmark formula as it was previously put at two-thirds of the\r\nbenchmark. But I agree with many Singaporeans that it is not useful\r\nto talk about a discount as a measure of public service and sacrifice.\r\nMoreover, the discount figure of 40% is based on a perception that\r\nit reflects accurately the level of discount that should be given\r\nto public service. This is arbitrary and subjective. I understand\r\nthough that the Review Committee suggested this approach in absence\r\nof any standard formula or convention that can be logically applied to\r\nthis scenario of Ministers doing their job both as a national service\r\nas well as a career.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-71c92516-7edc-4e8b-ac9f-d0bacf075f68\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-71c92516-7edc-4e8b-ac9f-d0bacf075f68\"><!--a--></a>This is, therefore, a much\r\nbetter approach as compared to what the Workers' Party is suggesting.\r\nThe Workers' Party suggested that we peg the salaries to the divisional director\r\nlevel which is about $10,000 per month, and which is the formula\r\nused in some of the 12 countries that they mentioned. I think we\r\ncannot give a partial solution because in most of these 12 countries\r\nthat the Workers' Party is comparing against, there are also a whole\r\nbunch of perks and allowances that are used to determine the final\r\nsalary of an MP which is then used to determine the final salary\r\nand allowance of a Minister. I looked at most of the countries that\r\nare suggested by the Workers' Party and guess what? None of them\r\nhas a clean wage system. They have many allowances and perks, some\r\nhidden perks. For example, in Japan, where MPs and Ministers get\r\nto rent a house in the prime district at about one-fifth of the\r\nmarket value. And also in addition to that, all the rest of the\r\nallowances that we know about \u2013 medical allowance, housing allowance\r\nand a whole bunch of others.

Many quote examples of leaders from other countries\r\nwho do not earn as high salaries as our leaders. However, what they\r\nmiss is that leaders from other countries get everything else, the\r\nperks that I mentioned, cars, homes, servants and food items, paid\r\nin addition to their salaries.

And then there is a whole slew of other allowances \u2013\r\nstaffing expenditure, communications expenditure, admin and office\r\nexpenditure, IT equipment, London calls allowance, London accommodation\r\nallowance, personal, additional accommodation allowance, constituency\r\noffice allowance and these do not include things like chauffeured- driven\r\ncars in the range of Jaguars for many Cabinet Ministers and those\r\nwho claimed mileage allowances and also the whole range of pension\r\nand medical benefits that they get. Just taking what could be accounted\r\nfor, I added these to be \u00a3411,000 which is about S$815,000.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-bb31afb7-483a-41fe-a505-04a8940c0fbe\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-bb31afb7-483a-41fe-a505-04a8940c0fbe\"><!--a--></a>I do not think paying our\r\nMinisters what we pay is overly high.

The President of the French Senate\r\ncommands an undisclosed, virtually uncontrolled expense budget which\r\nis about \u00a32.2 million per year, much higher than what our Ministers\r\nget. On a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, India pays the most\r\nto their MPs while Japan, Italy and Singapore pay about the same\r\nlevel. In these countries that I mentioned, their unofficial income\r\nof MPs and Ministers is a lot higher than the official income. And\r\nif you want to have an internationally comparable standard, I think\r\na good measure would be to look at the GDP per capita on a price\r\nPPP basis. This ratio is about 35 for US and for most Western Europe\r\nand Japan, it is about 10 times for an MP. In Singapore, at the\r\nPPP-GDP of about $59,000 and an MP allowance of $192,000, our ratio is\r\n3.2 which is not overly generous in my opinion.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 872</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3f93ff1c-e4ea-4f92-a14d-be1cffa3730b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-3f93ff1c-e4ea-4f92-a14d-be1cffa3730b\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I agree with the general\r\nview that salary should not be an incentive to lure or to attract\r\ntalent into public service.

Each time, we will raise the same\r\nissues over and over again. Perhaps a new Prime Minister in each\r\nera may want to review the structure but I do not agree with a review\r\nevery five years. What each Prime Minister can do, before he hands over\r\nto the next Prime Minister, is to decide on good bonuses in good\r\nyears and for good performance, and temporary salary cuts in bad\r\nyears and for poor performers.

In 2008-2009, when we faced a terrible financial\r\ncrisis, I think Mr Tharmum Shanmugaratnam as the Finance Minister\r\nshould have got a much higher bonus than what he may have got. In\r\nthe private sector, I think contrary to the issue raised by Mr Giam,\r\nit is not two or three months of bonus. Even in a small company\r\nthat I know of last year, a person at the middle level had about\r\n10-11 months of bonus whereas the CEO had about 15 months of bonus.\r\nAnd in the financial sector, it is even higher than that. So the\r\n13.5-month bonus is not an overly high number; it is something that\r\nis required to reward talent for the good job that they do. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-a79b60f6-b7fe-4b1f-acc4-01d4eef2a765\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-a79b60f6-b7fe-4b1f-acc4-01d4eef2a765\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-af501e05-79cc-4d86-80e0-53ae550e1324\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-af501e05-79cc-4d86-80e0-53ae550e1324\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Speaker</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Yes, Mr Singh?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-5da72a4a-bd4d-400c-b2d1-eb07408c1ed6\">\r\n               <a name=\"motion__id-5da72a4a-bd4d-400c-b2d1-eb07408c1ed6\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fb4e0781-720b-4f31-9047-563eb179c713\">\r\n                  <a name=\"motion__id-fb4e0781-720b-4f31-9047-563eb179c713\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Pritam Singh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, just\r\nto confirm the clarification.

Instead of first pegging MP's allowance\r\nto the pay of divisional directors which is already pegged to market norms,\r\nand then arriving at the Ministerial salaries using some multiple,\r\nwhich is arbitrary, would it not be much more transparent to peg\r\nMinisterial salaries to the competitive salaries that the calibre\r\nof people we are looking for in Ministers earn, or have the potential\r\nto earn, coupled with a discount for the ethos of public service? Currently\r\nas the MP allowance is a percentage of the entry level Minister's\r\nsalary (17.5% of\r\nMR4 benchmark), the latter is already conversely a multiple of the\r\nformer!

Currently, Ministries can appoint officers either on permanent\r\ntenure subject to a probation period, or on contract.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3b103af9-22f9-43cb-ae07-3325881f01b7\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-3b103af9-22f9-43cb-ae07-3325881f01b7\"><!--a--></a>Over the years, Ministries\r\nhave found the contract framework useful to appoint new officers\r\nto assess their suitability for the job. This is beneficial for\r\nboth the Ministries as well as the officers as it allows both parties\r\na period of time to assess whether there is a good fit before making\r\na permanent commitment. If the Ministries had to decide before such\r\na period of mutual assessment, the Ministries may be hesitant to\r\nmake a job offer at all. For officers who have performed well in\r\nthe job and are assessed to be suitable for a long term career with\r\nthe Civil Service, Ministries will offer the candidates permanent\r\npositions after one or two years. The contract arrangement serves\r\nas a gracious way for officers who do not have a good job fit to\r\nexit. Their departure can then be tied to the end of their contracts\r\nrather than a failure to be confirmed, or for them to resign after\r\na short period of service.

In September 2011, we set up the\r\nPublic Hygiene Council (PHC) to galvanise efforts by the community\r\nand industry to improve cleanliness and hygiene in Singapore. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3b0f261d-ac63-42bb-b378-01010ee6be09\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-3b0f261d-ac63-42bb-b378-01010ee6be09\"><!--a--></a>The persistence of high-rise\r\nlittering in housing estates remains an ongoing challenge. Our laws\r\nagainst high-rise littering require the witnessing of the offence before\r\nprosecution can take place. Hence, apprehending high-rise littering\r\noffenders is manpower-intensive and involves long hours of staking\r\nout to catch the offender in the act. My Ministry is currently exploring\r\nsome technology solutions. Despite the best efforts of our enforcement\r\nofficers, it is not always possible to catch the offenders as most\r\nof the offences are committed at night, which makes it more difficult\r\nto clearly identify the offender. Therefore, encouraging greater\r\ncommunity ownership and civic responsibility remains the dominant\r\napproach in curbing the irresponsible and dangerous behaviour of\r\nhigh-rise littering. On this front, NEA has appointed Litter-Free Ambassadors\r\nto educate the public through house-to-house visits. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-cd3578c1-0d38-4c52-b780-20d25ed5752a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-cd3578c1-0d38-4c52-b780-20d25ed5752a\"><!--a--></a>As for general public cleanliness,\r\nwe have been carrying out litter-count surveys to track our progress.\r\nThe findings show some improvement in selected hot spots.

The most\r\nrecent stress test, conducted in the early part of last year, shows\r\nthat all major financial institutions would continue to maintain\r\nadequate capital buffers above MAS' regulatory requirements under\r\nthe prescribed stress scenarios.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-1ea35d79-cb60-40a8-bfd0-b6265d75bad5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-1ea35d79-cb60-40a8-bfd0-b6265d75bad5\"><!--a--></a>MAS' stress testing exercise\r\nhas been subject to international peer review and is aligned with\r\ninternational best practice. Let me describe briefly how it works.\r\nMAS identifies a range of external and domestic risks as part of\r\nits ongoing financial surveillance operations. It also draws on\r\nrisk assessments by international organisations such as the International\r\nMonetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board, and exchanges with\r\nother central banks and financial regulators, industry players and private\r\nsector analysts. MAS then develops scenarios using stressed values\r\nfor key risk parameters, such as credit spreads, yield curves, economic\r\ngrowth and property prices. Banks and insurance companies are then\r\nasked to conduct stress tests based on these scenarios. To ensure\r\nthat the results are robust, MAS engages the financial institutions to\r\nchallenge their underlying assumptions and review their stress test\r\nmethodologies.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ff46aa62-560a-458b-be7e-975c158e71a3\">\r\n                  <a name=\"hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-ff46aa62-560a-458b-be7e-975c158e71a3\"><!--a--></a>In addition to the industry-wide\r\nstress tests, MAS requires financial institutions to conduct more\r\nregular stress tests on their own to address risks that are specific\r\nto their operations.
