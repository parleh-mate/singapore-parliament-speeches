Singapore Power Ltd.  Singapore Power is one\r\n\r\nof the partners of StarHub.  Question No. 1, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, may I have your permission to take Question Nos. 1\r\n\r\nto 4 together as they are related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, since its formation in 1992, TAS has\r\n\r\nactively and consistently adopted a pro-competition approach. It\r\n\r\nis   committed   to  fully  liberalising  the  telecommunication\r\n\r\nindustry  to  ensure Singapore's competitiveness  and  to  allow\r\n\r\nconsumers  to  enjoy the benefits of competition,  ie,  a  wider\r\n\r\nrange of quality services and products at competitive prices. In\r\n\r\nline  with  this  philosophy,  TAS  has  liberalised  the  basic\r\n\r\ntelecommunication  services  market  earlier  than  planned,  by\r\n\r\nbringing  forward the expiry of the monopoly licence of  SingTel\r\n\r\nby 7 years from 2007 to the year 2000 at a cost of $1.5 billion.\r\n\r\nIt  opened the mobile phone and paging market in 1997.   It  has\r\n\r\nfurther liberalised the mobile services market from April  2000.\r\n\r\nThe  Internet  services market has been completely opened  since\r\n\r\nlast year.  The basic services market will also be opened up  to\r\n\r\nfurther competition from April 2002.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In liberalising the market, TAS has a duty to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe competition is sustainable or healthy. It has to ensure that\r\n\r\nincumbents  do  not  adopt anti-competitive  measures,  such  as\r\n\r\npredatory pricing, to keep out competitors. This is to safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  interests of consumers in the longer term by ensuring  that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not regress to the former monopolistic situation. It  is\r\n\r\nespecially  important  in  an industry  like  telecommunications\r\n\r\nwhere significant natural barriers to entry already exist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments in the mobile phone market serve to\r\n\r\nillustrate this point. There are only two players in the current\r\n\r\nmobile communication market. Until such time when there is  more\r\n\r\nand  freer  competition  in the market,  TAS  needs  to  approve\r\n\r\noperators'  proposals to ensure that (1) they do not  engage  in\r\n\r\npredatory pricing,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nie,  operators  which enjoy certain monopolistic privileges  are\r\n\r\nnot  using these to unfairly drive out other market players  and\r\n\r\n(2)  they  do not lock consumers into schemes that prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom switching operators freely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS has not rejected SingTel Mobile's proposal in this\r\n\r\nparticular  case. What it has said is that the  proposed  scheme\r\n\r\nwas  unclear  in some respects, and that SingTel Mobile  has  to\r\n\r\nrevert with more details to address TAS' concerns. These include\r\n\r\nwhether its loyalty programme is sustainable, and whether tie-in\r\n\r\nconditions would be imposed on subscribers to prevent them  from\r\n\r\nswitching  operators when the market is further  liberalised  in\r\n\r\nyear 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If SingTel Mobile can satisfactorily address TAS' concerns,\r\n\r\nTAS will allow such a scheme to be marketed to the consumers  as\r\n\r\npermanent.  But until it is approved as a permanent scheme,  TAS\r\n\r\nhas to ensure that SingTel Mobile does not mislead its consumers\r\n\r\nby  marketing  it  as a permanent scheme, when it  is  currently\r\n\r\napproved  as a promotion only  valid till March 2000.    Let  me\r\n\r\nsay  that  TAS  has since received clarification  and  financial\r\n\r\ninformation from SingTel Mobile on its loyalty programme. TAS is\r\n\r\nsatisfied with the clarification and the business case and  will\r\n\r\napprove  the loyalty programme as a permanent scheme.  TAS  will\r\n\r\nbe issuing a formal announcement later today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS encourages any proposal that will benefit consumers in\r\n\r\nthe  long  run.  However, in keeping with its  role  to  protect\r\n\r\nconsumer interests, there have been past instances where TAS had\r\n\r\ndisapproved  schemes  or proposed modifications  to  schemes  to\r\n\r\nprevent  customers  from being tied down  or  having  to  suffer\r\n\r\npenalties  for switching operators.  In some cases,  competitive\r\n\r\nservices  had  been  bundled  with  monopoly  services,  to  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage of competitors without monopoly rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAS will take a progressively relaxed regulatory stance as\r\n\r\nthe  telecommunication industry is further liberalised from  1st\r\n\r\nApril next year. However, it will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontinue to impose minimum service standards, as well as minimum\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to protect the consumers and maintain  an  oversight\r\n\r\nrole   over   market  developments  to  ensure   a   sustainable\r\n\r\ncompetitive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, has TAS any plan to\r\n\r\ncarve  up the market, ie, set a maximum cap on the market  share\r\n\r\nfor  the different carriers?  The second question is: should one\r\n\r\nof  the carriers fail because the marketing of their products is\r\n\r\nnot  as well as the other carriers, will the Government bail out\r\n\r\nthat  particular carrier so that there will always be  this  so-called choice for consumers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, it is not possible for TAS to set\r\n\r\nmarket  caps  for  any player in the market.  This  is  for  the\r\n\r\nindividual players to work out, ie, for them to go and  gain  as\r\n\r\nmuch  market share as possible within the rules of the  game  as\r\n\r\nset  out,  in other words, there is no anti-competitive  pricing\r\n\r\nespecially   when  the  incumbent  operator  has   got   certain\r\n\r\nmonopolistic privileges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question which the Member asked was whether the\r\n\r\nGovernment would bail out an operator.  The answer obviously  is\r\n\r\nno.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister whether his Ministry has plans to issue  more\r\n\r\nlicences  for  mobile phones.  If there are, when will  they  be\r\n\r\nimplemented, what is the market size in Singapore and whether it\r\n\r\ncan sustain more than two operators at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as the Member is aware, although the\r\n\r\nmobile  phone  market has two operators, with effect  from  next\r\n\r\nyear, there will be another mobile phone operator in the market.\r\n\r\nThis was as a result of a competitive tender that was issued  in\r\n\r\n1998. TAS was prepared to issue up to two more licences.  But as\r\n\r\nthe  Member  may recall, one of the successful bidders  for  the\r\n\r\nlicence had to withdraw for various reasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no plans at the moment for Government to issue\r\n\r\nany more mobile phone licences. But the situation is a very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfluid  one and we have not indicated categorically that we  will\r\n\r\nnot  be issuing any more licences.  In other words, as and  when\r\n\r\nthe  situation requires, we are free to issue more mobile  phone\r\n\r\nlicences but it must necessarily be after the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, following up from my previous\r\n\r\nquestion, does it mean that in that case TAS will make sure that\r\n\r\nprices will be held at a certain level until such time there are\r\n\r\nthree  or  more carriers who will then compete in a free  market\r\n\r\nwith  less regulation?  This means that ultimately it can  still\r\n\r\nlead  to market failure because one can have a strong competitor\r\n\r\nwhich then becomes a monopoly again.  What would TAS do in  that\r\n\r\ncase?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the main issue in this case is\r\n\r\nwhether  the  strong operator or the incumbent  operator,  which\r\n\r\nenjoys  certain  privileges that the  other  operator  does  not\r\n\r\nenjoy,  is  making use of this privileged position. Today  there\r\n\r\nare  two operators; one has got certain monopolistic privileges,\r\n\r\nthe other has not.  Until such time as the playing field is more\r\n\r\neven,  it  is  necessary for the regulator to  ensure  that  any\r\n\r\nchanges  or any new pricing schemes or any new market practices,\r\n\r\nfor  that matter, must be under scrutiny.  This does not suggest\r\n\r\nthat  prices  cannot  go down.  In fact,  as  I  have  announced\r\n\r\nearlier,  after  looking at the application and  making  certain\r\n\r\nqueries and receiving clarifications from the applicant, TAS  is\r\n\r\nnow  satisfied that the new pricing scheme does not in  any  way\r\n\r\naffect  the other operator.  Neither does it tie consumers  down\r\n\r\nso  that  they  do not have the flexibility or  the  freedom  to\r\n\r\nchange   operator  come  April  2000.   Having  received   those\r\n\r\nclarifications,  TAS is quite happy to approve the  new  loyalty\r\n\r\nscheme with lower prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the Minister is aware of Marketing\r\n\r\n101.  Price is only one of several practices in the market.   If\r\n\r\nprice is the only determinant, then all of us will be driving  a\r\n\r\nSuzuki  and not a Mercedes-Benz.  Quite clearly, the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmarketing  effort  or advertising expenditure has  a  tremendous\r\n\r\nimpact on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket  share.   The  question I want to ask  the  Minister  is,\r\n\r\nhypothetically, will TAS control a carrier if it wants to give a\r\n\r\nphone  free  of  charge,  for example?   Will  TAS  control  the\r\n\r\nmarketing  expenditure of the different carriers  to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat one will not over-spend to create a larger market share?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chng, may I remind you that you are not\r\n\r\npermitted to ask hypothetical questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister clarify\r\n\r\nthe  Government's response to a perception in some quarters that\r\n\r\nthe  TAS' current requirements are in part to protect the market\r\n\r\nfor new entrants in the mobile and fixed line industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the decision to license a third\r\n\r\nmobile operator has been made.  This third mobile phone operator\r\n\r\nwill commence its operations with effect from April 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the two current operators strive to capture whatever\r\n\r\nmarket  share  they can with their current innovative  marketing\r\n\r\nstrategies,  it is important for TAS to ensure that  come  April\r\n\r\n2000  the  market place will be a level playing  field  for  all\r\n\r\nplayers - first, second and third operators.  It is no use  for\r\n\r\nus  to  issue  a licence for a third operator when at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   the  existing  two  operators  are  allowed  to  capture\r\n\r\ncustomers and penalise them if they were to switch. If there are\r\n\r\nany loyalty programmes that are being put in place by either  of\r\n\r\nthe  operators  today to maximise their market  share,  that  is\r\n\r\nperfectly  all right, so long as come April 2000, customers  are\r\n\r\nfree to switch.  That is the key point, that there is no penalty\r\n\r\ninvolved in the switch.  If they want to have loyalty programmes\r\n\r\nfor  one, two, three or four years, that is perfectly fine.  The\r\n\r\nnew operator will have to contend with that but it must also  be\r\n\r\nable to bring customers on board because such customers are  not\r\n\r\ntied  down  by the existing loyalty scheme.  This ultimately  is\r\n\r\nfor the benefit of the consumers.  If we allow a situation where\r\n\r\nthe  two  operators currently tie up all the consumers,  we  are\r\n\r\nback  to a duopoly situation.  Then what is the point of issuing\r\n\r\na third licence?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come year 2000, customers will have more choice and TAS\r\n\r\nwants  to  ensure  they will be allowed to  switch  easily  from\r\n\r\nwhatever loyalty programmes they join today. The purpose of  the\r\n\r\nrequirement  by  the  regulator  to  approve  any  such  schemes\r\n\r\nbeforehand  is ultimately with the benefits of the consumers  in\r\n\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the\r\n\r\nMinister  then confirm that beyond April 2000 therefore  any  of\r\n\r\nthe three operators would be able to state any price or have any\r\n\r\nkind of loyalty programmes they want without any regulation?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I indicated earlier, as the market\r\n\r\nbecomes freer and as there are more players, the regulator  will\r\n\r\nnot  need  to  have the strict oversight role that it  currently\r\n\r\nhas.  This  will  be progressively relaxed as we  have  a  freer\r\n\r\nmarket situation and as the consumers become more savvy and more\r\n\r\ndiscriminating  in their choice.  In other words,  they  do  not\r\n\r\nlook at just the short-term.  It is fine to say, \"Let us have  a\r\n\r\nfree-for-all  now.   I want to enjoy the benefits  today.\"   But\r\n\r\nthey must be sophisticated and savvy enough to realise that they\r\n\r\nmust  also be able to enjoy the benefits of competition  in  the\r\n\r\nlonger  term,  in other words, that competition is  sustainable.\r\n\r\nThose are the conditions under which the regulatory regime  will\r\n\r\nand should operate beyond April 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether  the  regulator  is  being  unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncautious  in this regard, for example, if the operator wants  to\r\n\r\ncut prices, to automatically allow the operator to do so, and if\r\n\r\nthere  are  any conditions attached, such as loyalty conditions,\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that the operator makes this clear that there  is  a\r\n\r\nnote  in  this regard that there would be a third operator  that\r\n\r\ncomes in in the year 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think this is what the regulator has\r\n\r\nsought  to  do.  The regulator has not said  that  you  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to make these filings.  What the regulator has said  is,\r\n\r\nwhen you make the filing or want\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  make  a  public  announcement, make it clear  that  this  is\r\n\r\nsubject   to  approval.   If  you  want  to  have  such  loyalty\r\n\r\nprogrammes, you must let the regulator know what are the precise\r\n\r\nterms and conditions before you implement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could argue that we could let them implement first and\r\n\r\nthen  take  retrospective action thereafter.  This  is  possible\r\n\r\nexcept that it can be a little messy, if, for example, customers\r\n\r\nare  tied in by contract to loyalty programmes and then you have\r\n\r\nto  unwind  later  on.  On hindsight, at this  stage,  TAS,  the\r\n\r\nregulator,  feels  that it is better to make the  clarifications\r\n\r\nbefore  implementation, rather than after.  But as I said,  when\r\n\r\nthe third operator comes in, subsequently even fourth, fifth  or\r\n\r\nmore,  the  market will be in a much more competitive situation.\r\n\r\nThe  regulator can then take one or two steps backwards and  the\r\n\r\nconsumer can then be depended upon to make those choices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today, where there are only two operators, as the\r\n\r\nexperience  has  shown  in many other countries,  in  a  duopoly\r\n\r\nsituation,  you  have  to ensure that the  major  operator,  the\r\n\r\nincumbent operator, does not make use of the privilege  that  it\r\n\r\nhas to push aside competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Could the Minister inform the House how TAS'\r\n\r\nregulatory  requirements  compare with similar  requirements  in\r\n\r\ncountries  which  are at a comparable state  of  development  in\r\n\r\ntheir telecommunications industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I have here a list of the regulatory\r\n\r\nbodies  overseas  that  have  similar  requirements.   OFTA   in\r\n\r\nHongkong,  OFTEL  in  the  UK,  ACA  in  Australia,  they   have\r\n\r\nestablished similar policies to what TAS has put in  place.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  I  had been told that Hongkong Telecom, for example,  was\r\n\r\nactually  ordered by OFTA to stop anti-competitive  prices.   In\r\n\r\n1998,  they were fined for engaging in widespread illegal  anti-competitive  practices in that year. Later, in  September  1998,\r\n\r\nthey  had to make similar announcements and take similar action.\r\n\r\nIn  the  UK,  over the past two years, OFTEL had to  investigate\r\n\r\ncomplaints on British Telecom, again the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincumbent operator, for engaging in alleged predatory prices for\r\n\r\nboth  Internet  services  and fixed line  services.    In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  this  is not something unique to Singapore.   There  are\r\n\r\nsimilar  experiences in many regimes where markets are  starting\r\n\r\nto  liberalise, and you have  a situation where you do not  have\r\n\r\nmany players in the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Does the Minister agree that this whole\r\n\r\nincident,  particularly  in terms of the  public  communication,\r\n\r\ncould have been better handled?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I asked that same question myself. I\r\n\r\nasked  TAS  why  is  it that they came out so strongly,  as  the\r\n\r\nheadline  put it, \"to slam the two operators\". I went into  some\r\n\r\ndetail  about  this because I felt that it was,  as  the  Member\r\n\r\npointed  out,  totally unnecessary.  TAS informed  me  that,  in\r\n\r\nfact, when they were asked for clarification, all they said  was\r\n\r\nthat  the two service providers should seek TAS' approval before\r\n\r\nthey announced their proposals, in other words, make it clear to\r\n\r\nthe  public  that these are subject to approval  so  as  not  to\r\n\r\nmislead the public. That is all.  I thought that was a perfectly\r\n\r\nreasonable response to the query.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I was surprised to see that it became something of a\r\n\r\nfurore, first of all, starting with the headline that \"TAS slams\r\n\r\nthe  Friday shoot-out\".  Thereafter, it was also quoted that TAS\r\n\r\nfelt  that  the operator was either too quick off  the  mark  or\r\n\r\ncould  be  misleading the public.  I am told that such  comments\r\n\r\nwere  not  actually made at all although they were  ascribed  to\r\n\r\nTAS.

These shares and warrants also make up nearly all  the\r\n\r\ntop  gainers  in  recent months, although the stock  market  has\r\n\r\ndeclined  since  mid-January, and the prices  of  warrants  have\r\n\r\nfallen back more sharply than the general market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several factors account for this interest in low-priced shares\r\n\r\nand warrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Investor sentiment in Singapore has improved, along\r\n\r\nwith sentiment in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) After the larger stocks chalked up substantial gains, the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  retail investors has shifted to low-priced  shares\r\n\r\nand warrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Several recent company mergers and acquisitions have fanned\r\n\r\nrumours  of take-overs of other SES-listed companies.  Sometimes\r\n\r\nthe  rumours persisted despite repeated categorical  denials  by\r\n\r\nthe companies concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-priced stocks are not necessarily good investments. Ten\r\n\r\ncents,  cheap, cheap, is not the right approach.  For  the  same\r\n\r\ndollar  amount, an investor can either buy more units of a  low-priced  stock,  or  fewer units of a higher-priced  stock.  1000\r\n\r\nshares  costing  10 cents each in a mediocre  company  will  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  outperform 10 shares costing $10  each  in  a  good\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrants are sophisticated financial instruments. Investors who\r\n\r\nbuy warrants must understand the mechanics of how they work, and\r\n\r\nthe  principles which determine how much the warrants are worth.\r\n\r\nA warrant may be low-priced, not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecause  it  offers good value for money, but  because  it  will\r\n\r\nexpire  soon  and  has  a high exercise price,  which  makes  it\r\n\r\nunlikely  for  the underlying share to trade above the  exercise\r\n\r\nprice before the warrant expires.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious investors should consider the company's fundamentals\r\n\r\nsuch  as its earnings, assets, management, prospects and  price-earnings  ratio  before making investment decisions.  Those  who\r\n\r\nspeculate  in  shares and warrants, or trade on market  rumours,\r\n\r\nshould realise and accept the attendant high risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange will ensure that the stock market operates in\r\n\r\na  fair and transparent manner.

This  will\r\n\r\nachieve three objectives:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it will encourage banks to provide efficient and\r\n\r\ninnovative services, comparable to the best available  in  other\r\n\r\nmajor financial centres;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it will nurture a group of robust local banks who\r\n\r\nmeasure  up  against leading international players operating  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and abroad; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it will encourage strong and well-managed foreign\r\n\r\ninstitutions to expand their activities in Singapore, and take a\r\n\r\nstake in the growth and stability of our financial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I announced in July last year that MAS would progressively open\r\n\r\nup  the  domestic  banking sector over  five  years.   When  MAS\r\n\r\nbriefed its International Advisory Panel (IAP) on its plans, the\r\n\r\nIAP  agreed  with MAS' policy of liberalisation.  The  IAP  also\r\n\r\nagreed on the importance of having strong local players after we\r\n\r\nliberalise.   However,  the IAP felt that  five  years  was  not\r\n\r\nambitious  enough, and recommended the MAS consider speeding  up\r\n\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is now working out the specific liberalisation measures\r\n\r\nand  will  take the IAP's views into account.  It will  probably\r\n\r\nkeep the five-year time frame,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  take  bolder steps in the earlier years.  We will  announce\r\n\r\nthe programme of liberalisation soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS is reviewing all restrictions in the domestic retail\r\n\r\nsector, including limits on opening additional branches, setting-up  off-premise ATMs, participating in shared-ATM  networks  and\r\n\r\noffering  Electronic  Funds Transfer at  Point-of-Sale  (EFTPOS)\r\n\r\nservices.   MAS is also reviewing rules governing foreign  banks\r\n\r\ngranted  offshore licences, to see how reputable offshore  banks\r\n\r\ncan have greater access to the domestic market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, foreign banks already have wide access to Singapore's\r\n\r\nbanking  sector.   They  compete  freely  with  local  banks  in\r\n\r\nwholesale  domestic banking, offshore banking, and treasury  and\r\n\r\ncapital market activities, but face restrictions in the domestic\r\n\r\nretail  market.  Foreign banks account for more than a third  of\r\n\r\ntotal resident deposits, and 45% of loans to resident borrowers,\r\n\r\nnearly  half.   They  also account for  the  vast  bulk  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  with non-residents; in fact, 86% of deposits  of  non-residents  and  95%  of loans to non-residents.   Foreign  banks\r\n\r\nenjoy a larger market share in Singapore than elsewhere in Asia,\r\n\r\nor in any major financial centre.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, MAS intends to liberalise the banking system\r\n\r\nfurther,  as  this  is  the best way to  upgrade  the  industry,\r\n\r\ndevelop  robust  local  banks,  and  enhance  our  role  as   an\r\n\r\ninternational   financial  centre.   We   will   not   open   up\r\n\r\nindiscriminately,  and risk the high prudential  standards  that\r\n\r\nour  reputation depends upon.  Instead MAS will provide  greater\r\n\r\naccess to foreign banks with strong global track records,  sound\r\n\r\ncredit  ratings,  and a demonstrated commitment  to  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfinancial system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Market analysts and rating agencies consider Singapore banks the\r\n\r\nsoundest  and best in Asia.  Our banks operate efficiently,  and\r\n\r\noffer  high  quality  retail  banking  services.   However,  the\r\n\r\nbanking environment is being transformed, in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregion and globally.  Existing franchises and market shares  are\r\n\r\nbeing challenged.  Players who do not adjust quickly and develop\r\n\r\nnew capabilities quickly risk losing their positions altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition, not protection, is the only way to develop strong\r\n\r\nlocal  banks  which  measure up against the  best  international\r\n\r\nplayers.   Our  banks  must make this leap to  make  the  grade.\r\n\r\nUnless  they  gear  up  now to hold their  own  against  greater\r\n\r\ncompetition in an open domestic market, they will not  be  ready\r\n\r\nto compete for opportunities in Asia as the region recovers over\r\n\r\nthe next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that more than one Singapore bank will develop a\r\n\r\nsignificant presence in Asian and international markets.  To  do\r\n\r\nthis,  Singapore  banks  must provide innovative  and  efficient\r\n\r\npersonal financial services comparable to the best retail banks,\r\n\r\nand  strengthen their capabilities in corporate banking and non-traditional, fee-based businesses.  No bank can be strong in all\r\n\r\nareas  of  banking. Some local banks will choose to  specialise.\r\n\r\nBut  to  compete, they all have to use capital more efficiently,\r\n\r\nand  cut costs by farming out back-room operations that  can  be\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently  performed  outside,  just  like  the  leading\r\n\r\ninternational  banks do.  Most important, they need  to  attract\r\n\r\nthe  best banking talent available, whether locally and  abroad,\r\n\r\nput in place systems to reward and motivate top performance, and\r\n\r\nbuild outstanding management teams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that several local banks have already announced and\r\n\r\nstarted implementing plans to prepare for the new era.

The Government\r\n\r\ndoes not operate banks, not even DBS that operates commercially.\r\n\r\nAnd the best spur to banks to compete, to upgrade and to improve\r\n\r\nis  competition.   You  just look at what has  happened  in  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications business.  There was a long  discussion  just\r\n\r\nnow.   It has arisen because we have opened up the market and  a\r\n\r\ntremendous  energy has developed, and innovations,  new  trials.\r\n\r\nOnce  in  a while, people have to be reined back but it is  good\r\n\r\nthat  we are reining them back, rather than having to prod  them\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banks are slightly different because if there is too much\r\n\r\nexcitement, some mishaps may happen and a lot of depositors will\r\n\r\nget hurt.  So we have to be more careful.  What we can do is  to\r\n\r\ngive due notice, make our policies quite clear, liberalise, make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the rules are fair and not overly onerous  to  local\r\n\r\nbanks,    because sometimes the local banks point  out  that  in\r\n\r\nsome respects, we are even harder on them than on foreign banks.\r\n\r\nSo  we  have  to be even handed and then we have  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nmarket  to  do its work.  And if you read what the  local  banks\r\n\r\nhave  been planning, announcing and changing over the  last  few\r\n\r\nmonths, I think that the transformation has begun, because there\r\n\r\nhave  been some mergers.  DBS has gone with POSBank, Keppel Bank\r\n\r\nwith Tat Lee Bank.  There have been changes in their strategies.\r\n\r\nThey  have  brought in new personnel.  They have  announced  new\r\n\r\nplans.  They have focused on returns to shareholders.  They have\r\n\r\nfocused  on new services and new ways to deliver these services.\r\n\r\nI  think that competition is doing its work.  Singaporeans often\r\n\r\nsay  that they should be allowed to flower on their own and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  next breath, ask what is the Government doing to help  them\r\n\r\nto flower.

It  is  a  catalyst  to  encourage   leading\r\n\r\ninternational  fund  management companies to  locate  or  expand\r\n\r\ntheir  operations  in  Singapore.   Asset  management  companies\r\n\r\nreceiving  public  funds to manage are committed  to  increasing\r\n\r\nheadcount  and  funds  under management, including  non-resident\r\n\r\nfunds,  in  Singapore.  They are also expected to introduce  new\r\n\r\ninvestment capabilities and activities in Singapore.   This will\r\n\r\nexpand the breadth and depth of our asset management industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February last year, the Government of Singapore\r\n\r\nInvestment Corporation (GIC) announced that it would  place  out\r\n\r\nS$25 billion over the next three years to external fund managers\r\n\r\nwho  have offices in Singapore.  As at end-1998, GIC had  placed\r\n\r\nout  a total of $16.9 billion to  fund management companies with\r\n\r\noffices  in Singapore.  Of this amount, $6.8 billion was  placed\r\n\r\nout  in  1998  as a whole.  In other words, over  the  next  two\r\n\r\nyears,  1999  and  2000, we will be placing  out  about  another\r\n\r\nS$18.2 billion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, MAS announced that it would place out\r\n\r\nS$10 billion over the next three years to external fund managers\r\n\r\nwith offices in Singapore.

Of the $10 billion,  MAS\r\n\r\nexpects to place out $2.5 billion this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also encouraged statutory boards and\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked  companies (GLCs) to place  out  their  excess\r\n\r\nfunds to external fund managers.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\nSir,   this  Bill  will  insert  a  new  section  8A  into   the\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act to protect the Presidential Elections\r\n\r\nCommittee or PEC from law suits which may be brought in  respect\r\n\r\nof  statements  made  by  the  Committee  in  discharge  of  its\r\n\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PEC was established under Article 18 of the\r\n\r\nConstitution.   The Committee serves two functions.   First,  it\r\n\r\nhas to certify that it is satisfied that a prospective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncandidate   is  a  person  of  integrity,  good  character   and\r\n\r\nreputation.  Second, in the case of a prospective candidate  who\r\n\r\ndoes  not  automatically  qualify under Article  19(2)(g)(i)  to\r\n\r\n(iii) of the Constitution, the Committee has to certify that  it\r\n\r\nis  of  the  opinion  that the prospective  candidate  has  such\r\n\r\nexperience  and  ability in managing financial  affairs  as  are\r\n\r\nnecessary for the office of the President.  This is an important\r\n\r\ncommittee  performing an important task.  It should be protected\r\n\r\nin its work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing its functions, the PEC may have to decline\r\n\r\nissuing certificates of integrity, good character and reputation\r\n\r\nor  certificates  of adequate ability and experience,  no  doubt\r\n\r\nafter  careful  consideration.  Such decisions  may  potentially\r\n\r\nlead  to  legal proceedings against the Committee's  members  by\r\n\r\naggrieved prospective candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the proper discharge by the Presidential\r\n\r\nElections  Committee of its duties and functions, the  Committee\r\n\r\nshould be immune from legal proceedings in respect of statements\r\n\r\nand  documents which it makes and publishes in discharge of  its\r\n\r\nfunctions.   The  immunity will apply  only  to  statements  and\r\n\r\ndocuments made and published by the Committee in discharging its\r\n\r\nfunctions  under the Constitution.  It will not apply  to  other\r\n\r\nstatements  and documents.  The immunity will apply so  long  as\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  malice on the part of the Presidential  Elections\r\n\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure that even with this provision, the Committee will\r\n\r\nbe  as  diligent  as it has been in assessing all  applications.\r\n\r\nAnd  also this provision is not an unusual one.  There are  also\r\n\r\nother  laws  which  confer immunity of such a nature.   Auditors\r\n\r\nenjoy  immunity  from defamation suits under the Companies  Act,\r\n\r\nFutures  Trading Act and Commodity Futures Act.   Likewise,  the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry  Council  and  the  Monetary  Authority  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (MAS) enjoy immunity from defamation suits under  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act and MAS Act respectively.  So, what more the PEC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I quite\r\n\r\nagree with the Minister of State that this is an important  job,\r\n\r\nespecially  with the coming elections for the Elected President.\r\n\r\nGood  men  and  good women must be free to do  their  job  which\r\n\r\nincludes assessing the possible candidates.  As the Minister  of\r\n\r\nState  has  told us, there is a degree of subjectivity  in  this\r\n\r\ntest  to  assess  possible candidates  in  terms  of  integrity,\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  good  reputation, as well  as  for  ability  and\r\n\r\nexperience.   And  in this subjectivity, people  may  reasonably\r\n\r\ndisagree,  even  reasonable  people.   There  is,  as  such,   a\r\n\r\npossibility  of defamation.  I think the Minister  of  State  is\r\n\r\ncorrect  in saying that this should be covered for the  sake  of\r\n\r\nthe PEC doing its full job free from any hesitation or fear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out, however, that this is, therefore, a\r\n\r\ncreation  by  this  House of an exception to  normal  defamation\r\n\r\nlaws.    It   is   this  House  recognising  that   in   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  there is a need for full and  free  comment  and\r\n\r\nthat  this  need prevails even where someone makes  a  negligent\r\n\r\nmistake,  even  if the PEC would by error of fact say  something\r\n\r\nwrong.   The exception we are creating will save them from  such\r\n\r\nmistakes   unless   there  is  actual  malice.    That   is   my\r\n\r\nunderstanding of this Bill.  But I concur with this need.  And I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  as  I  spoke on the motion to look at defamation  laws\r\n\r\nagain,  that  increasingly this House  must  face  the  need  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  full scrutiny of those who seek elected  office  and\r\n\r\nallow  exceptions for that job to be done.  This is despite  the\r\n\r\nfact  that, of course, with the Elected President, we  wish  the\r\n\r\nbest men and women to come forward to serve this country in this\r\n\r\nimportant post.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport  this amendment.  As a result of the Elected  President,\r\n\r\nwe  have this piece of legislation and the rationale behind this\r\n\r\namendment is indeed worthy of support of this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  is not a blanket immunity, as the Minister pointed out.   If\r\n\r\nthere is malice, the members have to face the consequences.  And\r\n\r\nI  think it is important that the Committee which deals  with  a\r\n\r\nvery  important post in the land should be free  to  assess  the\r\n\r\nsuitability  of the candidates.  I am glad, and I am  sure,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will do it again.  The most important  thing  is  to\r\n\r\nappoint  suitable people, people of integrity who  will  examine\r\n\r\nthe  suitability of the candidates, because there is a provision\r\n\r\nin  the  Constitution.   There may be  candidates  who  may  not\r\n\r\nautomatically qualify but who have to be certified by this body,\r\n\r\nand  in this case I rise to support the amendment.  I was rather\r\n\r\ntaken  aback why this was not included earlier when the Act  was\r\n\r\nfirst  enacted.   But  I see that since 1991,  there  have  been\r\n\r\nvarious  amendments  and  I think the House  should  unanimously\r\n\r\nsupport the move by the Minister.  Because, if we have to have a\r\n\r\ncommittee   that   must  function  within   the   constitutional\r\n\r\nframework, it is very important that the Committee must be  free\r\n\r\nto  come  to a decision.  As I have said earlier, the  Committee\r\n\r\nhas got certain limitation.  With this, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Mr Rai\r\n\r\nand Mr Tay for supporting the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I think the key, as Mr Rai has pointed out, is to select\r\n\r\nthe  right people for the job, and this is provided for  in  the\r\n\r\nConstitution  where the Chairman is the Chairman of  the  Public\r\n\r\nService  Commission  and the members are  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Accountants Board and a member nominated by the Chairman\r\n\r\nof the Presidential Council for Minority Rights.  So that is the\r\n\r\nkey.   Once  you have the right people with the right experience\r\n\r\nand  the  right standing to make the assessment, no doubt  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  some  element  of  subjectivity,  but  it  will  be  a\r\n\r\nconsidered judgement of all three members looking at facts which\r\n\r\nare  essentially furnished in the form by the applicant.  So the\r\n\r\npoint,  Sir, is that this clause will further help the Committee\r\n\r\nin exercising considered judgement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay is right in that it is an exception to the law of\r\n\r\ndefamation.  But, as I have pointed out, this is not  the  first\r\n\r\ntime  we are doing it.  There are also other laws, although  the\r\n\r\nlaws  are more narrow in confining only to defamation.  In  this\r\n\r\ncase,  yes, the clause is wide enough to cover situations,  like\r\n\r\nnegligent mis-statements.  If you look at the functions  of  the\r\n\r\nCommittee, the possibility of it being liable or being caught in\r\n\r\na  situation where it has given a negligent statement  is  quite\r\n\r\nunlikely.   So  the  main  thrust, as I  see  it,  will  be  the\r\n\r\npossibility of defamation suits which, in any case, because  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  will continue to exercise considered judgement,  will\r\n\r\nagain be not likely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  -  [Assoc.

This will allow  us  to\r\n\r\nlegislate  certain pollution control requirements and  practices\r\n\r\nwhich   are   now  specified  administratively,  and   add   new\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Environmental Pollution Control (EPC) Bill, when\r\n\r\npassed,  will repeal the Clean Air Act (Chapter 45) and Part  VI\r\n\r\nof  the Environmental Public Health Act (Chapter 95), with  some\r\n\r\nconsequential  amendments to the Poisons Act (Chapter  234)  and\r\n\r\nthe Medicine (Advertisement and Sale) Act (Chapter 177).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in many developing countries, industrialisation\r\n\r\nis  often achieved with little thought for the environment.   In\r\n\r\nactual fact, it is not the environment which is the only victim.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the population suffers too, through the ill  effects\r\n\r\nof a polluted environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government has not allowed industry to\r\n\r\ncompromise  our environmental standards.  We have regulated  the\r\n\r\nemission   of  pollutants  from  the  various  industries,   and\r\n\r\ninstituted  proper handling procedures for hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nWe  require companies to incorporate adequate pollution  control\r\n\r\nfacilities in the design and construction of their manufacturing\r\n\r\nfacilities,  and  monitor  to ensure  that  these  are  properly\r\n\r\noperated and maintained.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Capping of Emissions of Pollutants from Industries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's industrial landscape has changed significantly over\r\n\r\nthe  past 40 years.  Today, most of our manufacturing operations\r\n\r\nare  of  a  world-scale.   Many of  them  handle  and  discharge\r\n\r\nchemicals  which, if not controlled properly, can  pose  serious\r\n\r\nthreats  to our environment as well as to the health and  safety\r\n\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the total pollutants emitted into the air today are within\r\n\r\nsafe  limits,  the amount of pollutants will increase  with  the\r\n\r\ncontinued expansion and growth of our industrial sector  in  the\r\n\r\nyears  ahead.  We therefore cannot afford to be complacent,  and\r\n\r\nmust  ensure  that  we have adequate and appropriate  regulatory\r\n\r\npowers to deal with any new environmental development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, my Ministry has tackled pollution problems\r\n\r\nthrough  regulations made under various Acts.  For  example,  we\r\n\r\nintroduced the Poisons (Hazardous\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSubstances)   Rules,  1986  under  the  Poisons  Act   and   the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Public Health (Control of Noise  at  Construction\r\n\r\nSites)  Regulations, 1990 under the Environmental Public  Health\r\n\r\nAct.  Such controls will now be consolidated into the EPC  Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  Bill  will  also  give my Ministry  additional  powers  to\r\n\r\ncontrol or prohibit the emission of any particular air pollutant\r\n\r\nfrom any industrial or trade premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Engagement of registered inspectors to check completed developments</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, ENV officers carry out inspections of completed\r\n\r\ndevelopments    to   ensure   compliance   with    environmental\r\n\r\nrequirements.  To  encourage  self-regulation,  the  Bill   will\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the  engagement of registered inspectors  who  are\r\n\r\nprofessional architects or engineers to undertake such checks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Putting existing practices into law</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, before major projects such as oil refineries,\r\n\r\npetrochemical  plants and land reclamation are  implemented,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will ask the developer to submit details of  pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol measures and, if necessary, risk assessment studies.  We\r\n\r\nalso  require installations using hazardous substances to  carry\r\n\r\nout regular safety audits on the safe handling and management of\r\n\r\nsuch substances.  Industrial premises discharging air pollutants\r\n\r\ninto  the atmosphere or trade effluent into the water-course  or\r\n\r\nsewer  are  required to monitor such discharges,  treating  them\r\n\r\nfirst,  where  necessary.  All these administrative requirements\r\n\r\nwill  now  be provided for in the EPC Bill and thus, be  legally\r\n\r\nenforceable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will enable the Ministry to control air pollution from\r\n\r\nsources  other than industrial and commercial premises, such  as\r\n\r\nsmoky  vehicles.   The  particulates  emitted  by  diesel-driven\r\n\r\nvehicles  are very fine and a large proportion of them are  less\r\n\r\nthan  2.5 micron in size (and these are commonly referred to  as\r\n\r\nPM2.5).   Our studies indicate that diesel particulates make  up\r\n\r\nmore than 50% of the PM2.5 in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  air.   Studies  in the US and other countries  have  linked\r\n\r\nPM2.5  to  an  increase  in respiratory diseases  and  increased\r\n\r\nmortality.   The  studies indicate that it is  prudent  to  keep\r\n\r\nPM2.5  levels as low as possible in order to protect the  health\r\n\r\nof  the  population.   Poorly-maintained diesel-driven  vehicles\r\n\r\ngive  off  excessive  amount of particulates.  My  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nworked  closely with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and  the\r\n\r\nTraffic   Police  to  take  enforcement  action  against   smoky\r\n\r\nvehicles.    Although  the  proportion  of  smoky  diesel-driven\r\n\r\nvehicles  has gradually reduced over the years, the  number  has\r\n\r\nnonetheless remained high.  My Ministry will continue to step up\r\n\r\nenforcement  action against smoky vehicles in  Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nBill  will  result in my Ministry taking over from the  LTA  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility for enforcement against smoky vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will extend my Ministry's controls over noise from\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites  and  other sources.   It  will  empower  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  order  construction  sites  and  workplaces   that\r\n\r\ngenerate excessive noise affecting residential neighbourhoods to\r\n\r\nstop  work  if  they  fail  to comply  with  a  notice  to  take\r\n\r\nappropriate measures to control noise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry vets building plans for compliance with pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol  requirements and gives its clearance  to  the  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Division which then issues approval under the  Building\r\n\r\nControl  Act.   The Bill will include provisions  requiring  the\r\n\r\ndirect submission of building plans to ENV for pollution control\r\n\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Major provisions of the EPC Bill</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major provisions that are being\r\n\r\nintroduced in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Use of Scheduled Premises (Part III)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scheduled premises are specified in the First Schedule. They\r\n\r\nare industrial premises which store bulk quantities of hazardous\r\n\r\nsubstances  or carry out activities that may cause  serious  air\r\n\r\npollution.  Clauses 6 to 9 require such premises to be  licensed\r\n\r\nbefore they can be occupied or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nused.  ENV will impose appropriate conditions in the licence  to\r\n\r\nprevent  and control pollution of the environment and to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   hazardous  substances  are  properly  managed   and\r\n\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Air Pollution Control (Part IV)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 10 to 14 of the Bill deal with the control of air\r\n\r\npollution.  Clause 10 requires the occupier of any industrial or\r\n\r\ntrade  premises  to maintain and efficiently  operate  any  fuel\r\n\r\nburning  equipment  and  any  air  pollution  control  equipment\r\n\r\ninstalled  in  the  premises.   Clause  12  provides   for   the\r\n\r\nintroduction of caps on total emissions of air impurities.   Any\r\n\r\nemission  in excess of such caps will be an offence.  Clause  12\r\n\r\nalso  allows  the  Minister to make regulations  to  control  or\r\n\r\nprohibit  emission of air impurities from any other source,  eg,\r\n\r\nmotor vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Water Pollution Control (Part V)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V of the Bill deals with water pollution control and\r\n\r\nthese are covered under clauses 15 to 19.  Under clause 15,  any\r\n\r\nperson  who intends to discharge trade effluent, oil,  chemical,\r\n\r\nsewage or other polluting substances into any drain or land  has\r\n\r\nto  obtain  a  licence.   This clause has been  strengthened  to\r\n\r\nincorporate  the  presumption that if there is evidence  of  any\r\n\r\ndischarge  of  trade effluent, oil, chemical,  sewage  or  other\r\n\r\npolluting matters from a premises into a drain or land without a\r\n\r\nlicence,  the  occupier of the premises shall be guilty  of  the\r\n\r\noffence  unless he can prove otherwise.  Clause 16 requires  any\r\n\r\noccupier to treat such trade effluent before it is discharged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 prohibits the discharge of any toxic or hazardous\r\n\r\nsubstance  into  any inland water.  Any person  who  contravenes\r\n\r\nthis  provision is liable on the first conviction to a fine  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $50,000 or imprisonment for a term not  exceeding  12\r\n\r\nmonths or to both, and on a second or subsequent conviction,  to\r\n\r\na fine not exceeding $100,000 and imprisonment for a term of not\r\n\r\nless  than  1  month  and not more than 12  months.   The  heavy\r\n\r\npenalties, including mandatory jail sentence for the second  and\r\n\r\nsubsequent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconvictions,  are  necessary  as  any  discharge  of  toxic   or\r\n\r\nhazardous  substance  into  our  inland  water  will  not   only\r\n\r\ncontaminate  our limited water resource, but also  endanger  the\r\n\r\nhealth and lives of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 18 empowers ENV to require any person who had discharged\r\n\r\nany  toxic or hazardous substance or other polluting matter onto\r\n\r\nany  land or into any drain or sea to remove and clean  up  such\r\n\r\nsubstance or matter within a specified time. Clause 19  empowers\r\n\r\nENV  to  require  any person to take measures to  prevent  water\r\n\r\npollution  due  to  the  storage  or  transportation  of   toxic\r\n\r\nsubstances   or  other  polluting  matters.   Currently,   these\r\n\r\nrequirements are enforced administratively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Land Pollution Control (Part VI)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 20 empowers the Minister to make regulations to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the pollution of land.  These would include regulations\r\n\r\nto require remedial measures to be taken on contaminated sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Control of land contamination</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In land scarce Singapore, land use is reviewed regularly to\r\n\r\nensure  optimal use.  Changes in land-use zoning may  result  in\r\n\r\nindustrial sites being re-zoned for residential, recreational or\r\n\r\nother  developments.  Such land-use conversions have  not  posed\r\n\r\nany  problems so far.  In some developed countries,  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  occasions  when  industrial land  had  been  converted  to\r\n\r\nresidential   use,   and  subsequently  found   to   have   been\r\n\r\ncontaminated only after the adverse effects on the health of the\r\n\r\nresidents showed up many years later.  By that time,  it  was  a\r\n\r\nbit too late.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, owners of industrial land, such as JTC and the Land\r\n\r\nOffice,  require  their tenants to carry out  soil  studies  and\r\n\r\nclean  up  contaminated land before the lands  are  returned  to\r\n\r\nthem.   This is done administratively.  My Ministry would advise\r\n\r\nJTC  and  the  Land Office the procedure and standard  for  soil\r\n\r\nstudies  and  clean up.  This Bill will empower the Minister  to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations to require that land found to be  contaminated\r\n\r\nwill have to be made good before change of use is allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Hazardous Substances Control (Part VII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 21 to 27 deal with the control of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\nClause  22 makes it an offence for any person to import, possess\r\n\r\nto sell, sell or offer for sale any hazardous substances without\r\n\r\na   licence.   Such  substances  are  specified  in  the  Second\r\n\r\nSchedule.  Clause 25 empowers ENV to require any person  keeping\r\n\r\nany  hazardous  substance stored or kept in a premises  that  is\r\n\r\nlikely  to threaten the health or safety of any person or  cause\r\n\r\npollution  to the environment to remove the hazardous  substance\r\n\r\nfor  disposal in a proper facility.  Currently, this is enforced\r\n\r\nthrough licensing control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 empowers ENV to require the owner or occupier of\r\n\r\ninstallations that store, use or handle hazardous substances  in\r\n\r\nbulk  quantities  to  carry out impact  analysis  studies.   The\r\n\r\nstudies  will  identify and quantify the risks of handling  such\r\n\r\nhazardous substances in the installations and recommend measures\r\n\r\nto minimise or prevent such risks.  The clause also empowers ENV\r\n\r\nto require such installations to review and audit their existing\r\n\r\nmeasures for the safe management of hazardous substances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Noise Control (Part VIII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 28 to 30 deal with the control of noise from\r\n\r\nconstruction activities and other works.  Clause 28 empowers ENV\r\n\r\nto  impose requirements on the way in which certain construction\r\n\r\nor  other  works are to be carried out in order to  control  the\r\n\r\nlevel of noise emitted from those works.  Clause 29 empowers ENV\r\n\r\nto prohibit any owner or occupier of any workplace from carrying\r\n\r\nout or permitting any specified activities which may cause noise\r\n\r\nto be emitted exceeding a specified level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ENV will be empowered to issue stop-work orders to construction\r\n\r\nsites and workplaces which generate excessive and loud noise and\r\n\r\nfail  to comply with a noise control notice issued by ENV.   Any\r\n\r\nperson who contravenes a stop-work order is liable on conviction\r\n\r\nto a fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day during\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich  the order is not complied with, or to imprisonment for  a\r\n\r\nterm  not  exceeding 3 months or both.  The strong measures  are\r\n\r\nnecessary to ensure that construction sites and workplaces  take\r\n\r\npractical  and  reasonable care to minimize  noise  nuisance  to\r\n\r\nnearby residents, after ENV has advised them to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Licences and Industrial Plant Works (Part IX)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 31 to 34 contain provisions on licences and industrial\r\n\r\nplant  works.   Currently, a person requires separate  licences,\r\n\r\npermits  and approvals to carry out various activities, such  as\r\n\r\ndischarging  trade  effluent,  occupying  and  using   scheduled\r\n\r\npremises,  importing  and  selling  hazardous  substances,  etc.\r\n\r\nUnder clause 31, he may apply for a single licence to carry  out\r\n\r\nthese activities.  This will greatly simplify administrative and\r\n\r\npaper work, and improve efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 33, qualified persons are required to submit\r\n\r\nbuilding plans of industrial plant works to ENV for the issue of\r\n\r\nclearance  certificates before such works can  be  carried  out.\r\n\r\nClause  33  also  allows  for such works  to  be  inspected  and\r\n\r\ncertified by professional architects or engineers registered  by\r\n\r\nENV for such purposes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Environmental Pollution Control Measures (Part X)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 35 to 40 contain provisions relating to measures for the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  environmental pollution.  Clause  35  introduces  a\r\n\r\npresumption that the main contractor of a construction  site  is\r\n\r\ndeemed  to have permitted the discharge of pollutants  from  the\r\n\r\nsite  or the open burning of construction debris on the site  if\r\n\r\nsuch incidents happen.  He will be liable to the same punishment\r\n\r\nas  the  person who actually commits the offence, unless he  can\r\n\r\nshow  proof  that he has exercised due diligence to prevent  the\r\n\r\noffence  from  taking  place.  This will ensure  that  the  main\r\n\r\ncontractor  exercises proper control over the construction  site\r\n\r\nand his workers and agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 36 empowers ENV to require any person intending to carry\r\n\r\nout any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactivity  that is likely to cause substantial pollution  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  to  carry  out a study on  environmental  pollution\r\n\r\ncontrol and implement such necessary preventive measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 empowers ENV to require the owner or occupier of any\r\n\r\npremises from which pollutants are emitted to install monitoring\r\n\r\nequipment  and suitable devices or systems to prevent or  reduce\r\n\r\nthe  emission  or discharge of such pollutants to  the  standard\r\n\r\nprescribed  in  the  regulations.   This  again  is  to  instill\r\n\r\ndiscipline and self-regulation in the industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 38 empowers the Minister to make regulations to\r\n\r\nrequire  any  industrial or trade premises or person  who  deals\r\n\r\nwith  hazardous  substances to take out and  maintain  insurance\r\n\r\nagainst environmental risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 39 empowers the Minister to order premises which\r\n\r\nemit  or  discharge air impurities, trade effluent or  hazardous\r\n\r\nsubstances   which  are  likely  to  cause  pollution   of   the\r\n\r\nenvironment or be injurious to public health or safety to:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) cease the process which causes such emission or discharge;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) cease such emission or discharge; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) carry out measures to collect, store and treat such\r\n\r\nemission or discharge to specified requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty for not complying with such an order is a fine not\r\n\r\nexceeding  $100,000 or imprisonment not exceeding  3  months  or\r\n\r\nboth and a further fine of $2,000 for every day during which the\r\n\r\noffence is continued after conviction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement (Part XI)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 41 to 50 contain provisions which confer on ENV powers\r\n\r\nwhich are necessary for the enforcement of the Bill.  Clauses 43\r\n\r\nto  45  give  authorised officers powers  of  investigation  and\r\n\r\narrest.  Such officers can interview and take the statement of a\r\n\r\nsuspected  offender or a witness of an offence under  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nIf such suspected offender or witness fails to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappear before the authorised officer as required, a warrant  may\r\n\r\nbe  issued by a Magistrate to secure his attendance.  Authorised\r\n\r\nofficers can also arrest and detain a person who is suspected to\r\n\r\nhave  committed  an offence under the Bill until  his  name  and\r\n\r\naddress can be correctly ascertained.  However, he shall not  be\r\n\r\ndetained  longer  than is necessary for bringing  him  before  a\r\n\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 47 and 48 give authorised officers power of entry.\r\n\r\nClause  50  empowers authorised officers to search any  premises\r\n\r\nsuspected  of  storing or dealing with hazardous  substances  or\r\n\r\nemitting  air  impurities or discharging trade effluent  without\r\n\r\npermission,  and  to seize, seal or take samples  of  substances\r\n\r\nfound in the premises.  They may also require the production  of\r\n\r\nrecords and documents and take photographs where necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Compensation, Damages and Costs (Part XII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 51 to 64 relate to the recovery of compensation, damages\r\n\r\nand  costs payable under the Bill.  Clause 51 provides  for  the\r\n\r\ndetermination  of  the  apportionment  of  the  amount  and  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  liability of any compensation, damages,  fees  and\r\n\r\ncosts under the Bill by a court in case of dispute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53 imposes a charge on the premises for the recovery of\r\n\r\ncosts  and  expenses incurred by the Government under  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich are payable by the owner of those premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Miscellaneous Provisions (Part XIII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 65 to 78 contain miscellaneous provisions. Clause\r\n\r\n72  provides for offences under the Bill to be compounded for  a\r\n\r\nsum not exceeding $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable my Ministry to deal with new\r\n\r\nchallenges  that  can  threaten the good living  environment  we\r\n\r\nenjoy  today.  With  its  passage, my  Ministry  will  have  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  powers to ensure that Singaporeans will  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy a clean and pollution free environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for permitting me to speak on this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a highly urbanised and densely populated city\r\n\r\nstate  such  as Singapore, the quality of the environment  is  a\r\n\r\ncrucial factor in our living standard.  In this instance, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  using  the word \"standard\" in the broadest sense,  not  just\r\n\r\neconomic   affluence.    In  fact,  without   a   high   quality\r\n\r\nenvironment,  economic  affluence  may  come  to  nothing.   The\r\n\r\nenvironment in Singapore, some one and a half years ago when  we\r\n\r\nwere  badly affected by the haze from Indonesia, is  a  case  in\r\n\r\npoint.  Yet, despite this motherhood truth, we still pollute our\r\n\r\nenvironment.   Yes,  Sir,  we  are the  polluters  of  the  very\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  sustains us and that is why an  Environmental\r\n\r\nPollution Control Bill is needed and this is why this Bill  must\r\n\r\nbe supported by all in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sir, if we are the polluters of the environment, then\r\n\r\nsurely to control pollution, we must start at the source of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  Although it is beyond the provisions of this  Bill,  I\r\n\r\nwould  urge  the Minister to expend greater efforts to  minimise\r\n\r\nthe  generation  of  pollutants.  This means tackling  the  very\r\n\r\nsources themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a social level, education plays a key role, especially\r\n\r\neducating  the  young.  Parents, teachers and religious  leaders\r\n\r\nmust be brought into the picture to teach our future generations\r\n\r\nthat  environmental pollution is as sinful as the  most  heinous\r\n\r\ncrimes.    Such  values  must  be  made  part  of   our   future\r\n\r\ngenerations' psyche.  In this respect, we, as adults,  must  set\r\n\r\ngood  examples for our children.  We must try, for our  sake  as\r\n\r\nwell as for their sake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I must hasten to add that Singapore is doing much in\r\n\r\nthis area.  The Ministry of the Environment, through its support\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Environmental Council and the various \"green\"\r\n\r\nnon-government organisations and its \"clean\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  green\"  programmes and campaigns, certainly  champions  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  cause.  I think the Government is  doing  a  good\r\n\r\njob.  But good is not enough.  More must be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the industrial level, the Government has done very\r\n\r\nlittle.   Other than giving vocal encouragement and  some  minor\r\n\r\nfinancial  incentives,  the Government  has  done  little  else,\r\n\r\nexcept for punishments.  In fact, Sir, this Bill under debate is\r\n\r\nthe  very example of this approach.  It is nothing more  than  a\r\n\r\nseries of \"Thou shall not do this\" and \"Thou shall not do  that\"\r\n\r\nand \"If thou disregard these edicts, thou shall be punished\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that this approach is not needed. All I am\r\n\r\nsaying   is  that  it  is  not  sufficient  to  change  habitual\r\n\r\nbehaviour.  Make no mistake about that; pollution is not because\r\n\r\none  wants  to pollute but because of personal convenience,  one\r\n\r\npollutes.   In  the case of industry, it is usually  because  of\r\n\r\nconvenience to the company and lower costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason why there cannot be financial incentives for\r\n\r\nthose  who are prepared to spend on equipment and procedures  to\r\n\r\nreduce  pollution  at  source.   For  example,  why  cannot  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  give  double tax deduction incentives  for  expenses\r\n\r\nrelating  to the attainment of ISO 14000 standards?  Why  cannot\r\n\r\nindividual   taxpayers   be  given  tax   deductions   for   the\r\n\r\ninstallation of solar heating systems in their homes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government really wants to change the mindset of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans with regard to pollution of the environment,  there\r\n\r\nshould be encouragement as well as punishment.  While punishment\r\n\r\nis  needed  for  the  wrongdoers, what is  more  needed  is  the\r\n\r\nencouragement   for  people  to  change  their   attitudes   and\r\n\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I said that adults must set good examples for\r\n\r\nchildren to follow.  Perhaps, I should also have added that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should set examples for adults to follow.   However,\r\n\r\nafter  all  that  is said and done, despite being  an  urbanised\r\n\r\nsociety  with a high per capita vehicle ownership,  the  world's\r\n\r\nbusiest sea port, a major hub for air transportation, a major\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npetroleum  refining and chemical manufacturing centre and  other\r\n\r\nactivities   which  can  give  rise  to  heavy  pollution,   our\r\n\r\nenvironment  remains relatively good and clean.   The  level  of\r\n\r\npollution  in  Singapore's  environment  is  below  the   limits\r\n\r\nprescribed  by America's Environmental Protection  Agency  (EPA)\r\n\r\nwho,  as  I  believe,  has  one of the  world's  most  stringent\r\n\r\nstandards in this area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do want to take this occasion to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Minister and his staff for a  job  well  done.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not to say that they have done all that  is  to\r\n\r\nbe  done  and can therefore rest on their laurels.   As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier, they could do so much more for the environmental cause,\r\n\r\nespecially tackling the problem from other angles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to the Bill itself, I find little to quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  it.   This is not surprising since the Bill is a piece  of\r\n\r\nlegislation to give power to the Government to enact  rules  and\r\n\r\nregulations to prevent pollution of the environment.  The  devil\r\n\r\nis  therefore  in the details and the enforcement of  compliance\r\n\r\nwith  the rules and regulations.  The legislative powers in  the\r\n\r\nBill  are  wide,  and  rightly so.  The  rules  and  regulations\r\n\r\narising from legislation will be tough with heavy, perhaps  even\r\n\r\ndraconian  penalties.   There is, however,  Sir,  pollution  and\r\n\r\npollution.   For  example,  air  pollution  may  originate  from\r\n\r\nfactories,  smoky vehicles or the burning of joss  papers.   Are\r\n\r\nthe culprits to be equally punished?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this Bill is passed, it will be in the hands of the\r\n\r\nExecutive to promulgate the rules and regulations and to enforce\r\n\r\ncompliance.  By the nature of the subject, the Bill is  long  on\r\n\r\nprinciples and short on details.  I would therefore request  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  make a categorical statement that in carrying  out\r\n\r\nthe  duties  under the Bill, his Ministry's officers will  carry\r\n\r\nthe big stick but will walk softly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On air pollution, despite the Minister's comments on his\r\n\r\ncooperation  with  the Land Transport Authority  (LTA)  and  the\r\n\r\nassumption  of  certain responsibilities from LTA,  I  am  still\r\n\r\nsurprised that motor vehicles come simply under clause 12(5)  as\r\n\r\n\"any other sources\".  After all, I would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestimate that about half the particulation pollution in the  air\r\n\r\noriginates from vehicular sources.  Motor vehicles are the major\r\n\r\nsingle source of pollution in this respect in Singapore and they\r\n\r\ndeserve  more attention than to be classified under  \"any  other\r\n\r\nsources\".   Moreover, with the spread of motor vehicle ownership\r\n\r\namongst   the   public,   the   people   need   to   know   what\r\n\r\nresponsibilities they have with regard to pollution in the  form\r\n\r\nof  more  specific items in the Bill.  The Bill should  be  more\r\n\r\nspecific on this.  Otherwise, we might as well have a Bill which\r\n\r\nsimply  states  that  this Bill empowers  the  Ministry  or  the\r\n\r\nMinister to enact all regulations to control pollution from  all\r\n\r\nsources, and that will cover everything if you do not want to be\r\n\r\nspecific about the items in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On water pollution, I would like the Minister to explain\r\n\r\nthe  reason for excluding the discharge of toxic substances into\r\n\r\nthe sea that is part of Singapore's territorial waters.  Surely,\r\n\r\nthe  sea  around  us is just as important as our  inland  water.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  it  is  covered under some other legislation  such  as\r\n\r\nPrevention of Pollution of the Sea Act.  Sir, if so,  then  this\r\n\r\nBill  is not complete in that it should include major items like\r\n\r\nthe  discharge of toxic substances into the sea forming part  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  territory.  I fear that with different  legislation\r\n\r\nunder  the  purview  of other Ministries,  things  may  fall  in\r\n\r\nbetween stools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, clause 4 of the Bill empowers the Ministry to\r\n\r\nauthorise  town  councils and statutory  boards  to  perform  or\r\n\r\nexercise  all  or any of the functions, duties and powers  under\r\n\r\nthe   Bill   and  the  regulations.   So  control  of  pollution\r\n\r\noriginating from items such as motor vehicles and discharging of\r\n\r\ntoxic substances into the sea could be part of the Bill with the\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  compliance either delegated to other  competent\r\n\r\nagencies  of the Government capable of doing the job or  in  the\r\n\r\ncase of smoky vehicles, by the Ministry itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill provides the Minister with powers\r\n\r\nrelating  to land pollution.  Sir, would this provision  overlap\r\n\r\nor conflict with the Environmental Public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHealth  Act?  Would the powers and jurisdiction of the  Director\r\n\r\nunder  this Bill and the Commissioner of Public Health  overlap?\r\n\r\nFor example, toxic and hazardous wastes are currently controlled\r\n\r\nunder  the  Environmental Public Health  Act  (Toxic  Industrial\r\n\r\nWaste) Regulations.  If these wastes contaminate the land, which\r\n\r\nregulations  would  take  preference?   Perhaps  this  provision\r\n\r\naddresses  a  gap  in the current regulations relating  to  land\r\n\r\npollution.  If so, could the Minister explain?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noise pollution is probably the most difficult type of\r\n\r\npollution  to define and to enforce.  The reason is that  though\r\n\r\nnoise  levels  can be measured objectively, noise  pollution  is\r\n\r\nrelative.   In  other words, what may not be noise pollution  to\r\n\r\none  person could be pollution to others.  It all depends on the\r\n\r\ngeneral level of noise of one's surrounding and the level one is\r\n\r\nused  to.   I am sure that one of the most difficult tasks  ever\r\n\r\nperformed  by  the  Ministry's officials is that  of  trying  to\r\n\r\npersuade  one  of  two contending parties that what  the  latter\r\n\r\ndeems  as  noise pollution is not noise pollution as defined  by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  regulations.  For example, if  one  is  unhappy\r\n\r\nabout noise, the Ministry officials will put a monitoring device\r\n\r\nat the noise source.   If the measurement of the noise at source\r\n\r\nis  below  the Ministry's limits, they will say that it  is  not\r\n\r\nnoise  pollution.  But to somebody who is not used to that heavy\r\n\r\nlevel  of  noise,  it is certainly pollution.  Therefore,  I  am\r\n\r\nsaying  that in cases like this, there would be a difference  in\r\n\r\nperception  simply because noise pollution is  a  very  relative\r\n\r\nitem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in coming out with the standards relating to noise\r\n\r\npollution, I hope the Ministry would take into consideration the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood in which the noise is being generated.  Instead of\r\n\r\njust using one standard measurement of noise level at the source\r\n\r\nof  the noise for all situations, the Ministry could perhaps use\r\n\r\ndiffering measurements for different situations.  For example, I\r\n\r\nwould  expect that construction sites next or near  to  schools,\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  residential  homes should  only  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ngenerate noise levels much lower than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthose  sites further afield.  The hours of operation could  also\r\n\r\nbe  much  more  curtailed so as not to cause noise pollution  in\r\n\r\nsuch neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 36 empowers the Director of Environmental Pollution\r\n\r\nControl  to call for a study on environmental pollution control,\r\n\r\nif  needed.  I suspect that such a study could be similar to  an\r\n\r\nenvironmental   impact  assessment  report  required   in   many\r\n\r\ncountries  to  ensure  that  damage  to  the  environment  by  a\r\n\r\nparticular  development  is  minimal  and  acceptable   to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   Such a study could be time consuming and expensive.\r\n\r\nI  would like to see the onus for calling such a study vested in\r\n\r\nthe Minister rather than the Director.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 37 is a new clause on the self-monitoring of one's own\r\n\r\npollution.   This  is a much-welcomed provision.   Increasingly,\r\n\r\nindustries  must  be required to self-monitor.   The  provision,\r\n\r\nhowever, could be improved with several additions.  For example,\r\n\r\nI think it should require the owner or occupier not only to self-monitor  but  also  to go through the results and  identify  the\r\n\r\ninfringements for the Ministry.  In this respect, I would expect\r\n\r\nthat  any  self-respecting company would not purposely  want  to\r\n\r\npollute,  but rather want to help prevent pollution.   And  this\r\n\r\ndefinitely  would help the Director to do a better  job.   Also,\r\n\r\nwhile  there are penalties for the unapproved alteration of  the\r\n\r\nmonitoring  equipment  or  system, there  is  no  provision  for\r\n\r\npenalties  on submission of false particulars or for failure  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  the  monitored data.  I think such provision  should  be\r\n\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the provision of enhanced penalties for\r\n\r\noffences  relating to pollution.  It is time for the  Government\r\n\r\nand  for  us  to  be tough on offences against  nature  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   In  this  respect, clause 71  taken  directly  from\r\n\r\nsection  67 of the Water Pollution Control and Drainage Act  may\r\n\r\nnot  be adequate.  It may not be as effective as section  42  of\r\n\r\nthe  Hazardous  Wastes (Import, Export and Transit)  Act,  under\r\n\r\nwhich  officers  of  the offending company are  presumed  to  be\r\n\r\nguilty unless they can prove that they have exercised\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  necessary due diligence of trying to prevent  the  offence.\r\n\r\nThis provision should be used instead of the current clause  71;\r\n\r\nperhaps  if  not  now, then in subsequent amendments.   It  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  compel  the  officers  of  more  companies  to   look\r\n\r\nseriously at preventing pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, environmental issues involve the whole community.\r\n\r\nMore  significantly, the community interest is increasing  these\r\n\r\ndays.  The recent furore in the possibility of a new golf course\r\n\r\non  the  banks of Kranji Reservoir is a case in point.  This  is\r\n\r\ngood  for  the development of a civil society in Singapore.   We\r\n\r\nshould encourage such a development.  I would therefore like  to\r\n\r\nrequest the Minister to refer this Bill to a Select Committee to\r\n\r\nensure that all those interested in preventing pollution of  our\r\n\r\nenvironment be given an opportunity to say their piece.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  moving  the  Second  Reading of  the  Amendment  Bill,   the\r\n\r\nMinister has touched on  many areas.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ngive my comments only on one aspect - noise pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an urbanised nation and we have progressed well in\r\n\r\nthe  past  three  decades. While we are  moving  into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury,  we face bigger challenges ahead.  We want  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  an international financial centre.   In  public\r\n\r\ntransport, we want to have a world-class land transport  system.\r\n\r\nIn  public housing, we want to see every Singaporean own his  or\r\n\r\nher own property.  In order that we would be able to attain such\r\n\r\nobjectives,  building  projects have  to  be  carried  out  very\r\n\r\nintensively.  In the process, there is of course the problem  of\r\n\r\nnoise pollution, which is inevitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, serious noise pollution will not only affect our living\r\n\r\nenvironment,  our quality of life and our health  will  also  be\r\n\r\naffected.   Workers who spend long hours in the noisy  worksites\r\n\r\nare  bound  to  suffer adverse effects on their  health.  It  is\r\n\r\nstipulated  that  the noise level for work carried  out  between\r\n\r\n<br>7.00 am and 7.00 pm should not exceed 75 dba, and after 7.00 pm,\r\n\r\nit\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  not exceed 65 dba.  Anyone who infringes this regulation\r\n\r\nwill  be  warned in the first instance, and if he  continues  to\r\n\r\ninfringe  this regulation he can be fined not more than  $10,000\r\n\r\nor  imprisonment for more than 3 months, or both such  fine  and\r\n\r\nimprisonment.   This  regulation may serve to  check  the  noise\r\n\r\npollution level at worksites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is no restriction on the number of hours that\r\n\r\nwork  can  be  carried out at worksites.  In fact, work  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  24  hours  a  day.  In the  day  time,  the  noise\r\n\r\npollution may be tolerated by the residents in the nearby  area,\r\n\r\nbut  in  the night time when the residents need to rest after  a\r\n\r\nhard  day's  work,  the  noise pollution is  simply  unbearable,\r\n\r\nparticularly  if the work sites are very close  to  the  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   For certain types of works, such as piling,  drilling\r\n\r\nand  mixing  of concrete, the noise generated can be very  loud,\r\n\r\nand  certainly very irritating. This will adversely  affect  the\r\n\r\nlives  of  the  residents.  Normally, in  the  HDB  estates,  we\r\n\r\nobserve that, after 8.00 pm, our children will have to do  their\r\n\r\nhomework  and the adults need to relax and prepare for the  next\r\n\r\nday's work.  For the elderly, particularly those who are not  in\r\n\r\ngood  health, they will require some quiet time to  rest.   This\r\n\r\nnoise pollution will cause a lot of unhappiness among the people\r\n\r\nand very often we, MPs, receive a lot of complaints from them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my constituency, there are at the moment four\r\n\r\nactive  work sites.  I received frequent complaints  on  two  of\r\n\r\nthem,  one  at  Guilin  View and the other at  Hillview  Estate,\r\n\r\nbecause they are very close to the HDB estate - as close as just\r\n\r\n50  metres  away.  Noise pollution from these two worksites  has\r\n\r\ndisturbed   our  residents.   I  have  personally  visited   the\r\n\r\nworksites  with the developers and our grassroots leaders.   The\r\n\r\ncontractors told me that they have complied with the regulations\r\n\r\nset  down by the Ministry of the Environment.  But, one evening,\r\n\r\nwhen  we  went down to one of the worksites, even the  developer\r\n\r\nhimself agreed that the noise was unbearable and that the  whole\r\n\r\nliving  environment  around the area  was  badly  disturbed.   I\r\n\r\nrequested  the developer to instruct his contractors to  refrain\r\n\r\nfrom carrying out activities which are very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnoisy  at  night.  He agreed.  From this, it can  be  seen  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  the complaints by the residents are valid  and  their\r\n\r\nrequests are not too unreasonable.   In the day  time, the noise\r\n\r\nis  there, but they put up with it.  But at night, they need  to\r\n\r\nhave some quiet time.  No doubt, building construction work  has\r\n\r\nto  go on, but the living environment of the people must also be\r\n\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three suggestions to make. First, at all worksites\r\n\r\nwhich  are in close proximity, say, within 100 metres  from  the\r\n\r\nhousing  estates,  the  work should be  constrained.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  after  8.00  pm, the contractor  should  not  carry  out\r\n\r\nactivities which are capable of generating loud noise so as  not\r\n\r\nto  affect  the living environment of the people.  For worksites\r\n\r\nwhich  are  in the middle of nowhere, for example,  in  the  new\r\n\r\ntowns  or places far away from housing estates, there would  not\r\n\r\nbe  a  problem.  They can work round the clock, 24 hours a  day.\r\n\r\nJust  now,  Mr Heng Chiang Meng  has also brought up  the  point\r\n\r\nabout  worksites which are near to hospitals and nursing  homes.\r\n\r\nIn those cases, the working hours should also be constrained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the measurement of the noise pollution index should be\r\n\r\ncarried  out more comprehensively.  For example, at  the  Guilin\r\n\r\nView  worksite, after complaints by the residents, I  went  with\r\n\r\nthe  grassroots leaders and the developers to the worksite.   At\r\n\r\nthe worksite, we found that the noise level was within the limit\r\n\r\npermitted  by the Ministry.  But when we went to the 9th  floor,\r\n\r\nwe  did not even need to take out the meter.  The noise was just\r\n\r\nso loud that we were unable to converse with one another without\r\n\r\nshouting.  It  was  obvious  that  the  residents  were  greatly\r\n\r\ndisturbed  by the noise.  I feel that when measuring  the  noise\r\n\r\nlevel,  more  comprehensive measures should be taken.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  at the lower floor, it may not be so noisy, but strange\r\n\r\nenough, when you go to the higher floors, the noise level  seems\r\n\r\nto rise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contractors should be more careful in taking\r\n\r\nmeasurements.  Perhaps\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome sort of device, like the speed limit detector on taxis, can\r\n\r\nbe installed.  On the taxi, once a certain preset speed limit is\r\n\r\nexceeded, the device would set off an alarm to indicate that the\r\n\r\ntaxi  has exceeded the limit. Likewise, if such a similar device\r\n\r\ncan  be installed at the worksite to detect the noise level once\r\n\r\nit  exceeds a certain preset limit, the alarm will be  triggered\r\n\r\noff,  and the contractor will know he has to do something  about\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all worksites are required to engage a safety officer\r\n\r\nto  be  stationed on site. I feel that with some  training,  the\r\n\r\nsafety officer could also take on an additional duty of checking\r\n\r\non  the  noise  level at the worksite.  I think taking  up  this\r\n\r\nadditional  responsibility  is not a  big  problem  because  the\r\n\r\nsafety  officer  has to be personally present  at  the  worksite\r\n\r\nanyway.  He has to ensure that all the safety measures are being\r\n\r\ntaken.   I feel that he could also do a good job in keeping  the\r\n\r\nnoise level down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Minister will look seriously into my\r\n\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   pollution  is  a  common  term  associated   with   rapid\r\n\r\nurbanisation  and industrial development. A recent report  shows\r\n\r\nthat  out  of the ten most polluted cities, nine are  in  China.\r\n\r\nThere  was  also a report that if nothing is done, in 20  years'\r\n\r\ntime, Hong Kong will be as polluted as Bangkok. In certain parts\r\n\r\nof  India,  the air is so polluted that one could  smell  petrol\r\n\r\nwhile  walking  in  the  street of the  city  of  Calcutta.  Air\r\n\r\npollution  does  not only exist in the developing  nations,  but\r\n\r\nalso  in  the western developed cities like Los Angeles,   Paris\r\n\r\nand Rome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very fortunate that despite rapid urbanisation and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  our  economy, the air  in  Singapore  is  still\r\n\r\npractically pollution-free and well suited for human habitation.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to be thankful for the stringent pollution control  by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  which manages and controls  the  various  anti-pollution laws to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure  that we do not follow the footsteps of others who  trade\r\n\r\npollution for economic development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, the different aspects of pollution were\r\n\r\nhandled  by  different ministries.  For example, the control  of\r\n\r\nhazardous  materials is administered by the Ministry of  Health,\r\n\r\nthe  Clean  Air  Act  is  administered by the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice,  and  water pollution comes under the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment. The existing arrangement causes difficulty  in  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and control of pollution. This is because  pollution\r\n\r\nwhich violates one particular Act would also violate the others.\r\n\r\nTake  the  example  of  discharge of hazardous  waste  into  the\r\n\r\nwatercourse that contravenes the water pollution regulations and\r\n\r\nalso  the  Control  of  Hazardous Materials  regulations.   Land\r\n\r\npollution  involves  evaporative  substance  which  will   cause\r\n\r\npollution to the air, the land and the watercourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill presented for Second Reading today combines all\r\n\r\nthe  pollution  matters  into  one  Bill  to  be  known  as  the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Pollution  Control Bill.   It  puts  all  matters\r\n\r\nrelating to the control of pollution into one Bill and it is  to\r\n\r\nbe  administered  by  one  ministry, ie,  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  As long as there is anything to do with pollution,\r\n\r\nbe  it  noise  pollution, air pollution, land pollution  or  any\r\n\r\ndangerous  substance that exists and causes health or  hazardous\r\n\r\nproblem  to  the  public, it will be under  the  ambit  of  this\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Pollution  Control Bill.   With  this  Bill,  the\r\n\r\nadministration of anti-pollution matters under one ministry  and\r\n\r\none  Bill,  it is good enough to deal with all the culprits  who\r\n\r\ncause  pollution  to our environment. To the  lay  person,  this\r\n\r\narrangement becomes very clear and easy for them. If there is  a\r\n\r\nproblem  concerning pollution, the Ministry of  the  Environment\r\n\r\nwill be the right Ministry to contact and to seek redress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on a few issues that have arisen\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Bill.   In Part II,  clause 5(1) to (4)  exempts  the\r\n\r\nDirector  from personal liability.  We all know that the  action\r\n\r\ntaken  by the Director is based on good faith in preventing  the\r\n\r\noutbreak of pollution that causes danger and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuffering to the public.  On certain occasions, the Director may\r\n\r\nmisjudge  and  his  subsequent action  could  cause  significant\r\n\r\nfinancial losses to people if things like production machines or\r\n\r\nprocesses  have  to be shut down.  If the Bill gives  a  blanket\r\n\r\nprotection to the Director who is fully exempted from  any  form\r\n\r\nof  liability,  there  might be an occasion  where  a  wrong  or\r\n\r\nconvenient  decision  could  be made  which  causes  substantial\r\n\r\nfinancial  losses  to the company and it  has  no  way  to  seek\r\n\r\nredress  under  this particular Bill.  If the liability  of  the\r\n\r\nDirector  is  not  fully exempted, he could be more  careful  in\r\n\r\nmaking  a decision in a borderline situation, and he would  also\r\n\r\nexamine   other  less  painful  alternatives  in  overcoming   a\r\n\r\npollution  problem.  If the officer is liable for his action,  a\r\n\r\nmore  sensible  decision and action would be  taken  in  such  a\r\n\r\nborderline  situation which is not just based on the best  anti-pollution  measures  but also the interest of  others  could  be\r\n\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Part IV mentioned about the prohibition of burning\r\n\r\ncombustible materials but it does not mention about  the  common\r\n\r\npollution  created  by  open  fire,  which  is  quite   commonly\r\n\r\npractised  in  the  past at construction  sites  when  disposing\r\n\r\nwooden  or  combustible construction wastes and  also  in  rural\r\n\r\nareas  where  small  traders  burn  used  electrical  wires  for\r\n\r\nrecovery of copper. Could the Minister clarify these matters?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18 (Part IV) mentioned about the provision to make\r\n\r\nthe  transportation  and storage of toxic and  polluting  matter\r\n\r\nsafe  as  required  by  the Director.   This  could  be  a  very\r\n\r\ntechnical  matter  and  subjected  to  different  opinions   and\r\n\r\ntechnical standards.  If there should be disagreement, the  Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not say how the matter could be resolved.  When a violation\r\n\r\ntakes  place  and hazardous materials are released, the  maximum\r\n\r\npenalty is $20,000. However, it does not say who should bear the\r\n\r\ncost of cleaning-up.  In my view, the culprit should be made  to\r\n\r\nbear  all  the  costs of the clean-up of the  pollution  he  has\r\n\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In air pollution, odour is one of the usual complaints by\r\n\r\nlay people. It is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubstance that creates an unpleasant smell but yet it might  not\r\n\r\nbe hazardous to health like other pollutants. The odorants could\r\n\r\nbe  introduced into the air in small amounts but the smell could\r\n\r\nbe  so  unbearable.  This  could  be  the  odorant  from  sewage\r\n\r\ntreatment  plants, fermentation of food from the food  industry,\r\n\r\nsolvents  from the application of glue and paint  and  from  the\r\n\r\ntarmac  plant producing road surfacing materials.  In  my  view,\r\n\r\ncontrol of this type of pollutants is quite loosely regulated in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I want to relate one of my experiences. I used to\r\n\r\ntravel  along Jalan Boon Lay.  Every time I was irritated  by  a\r\n\r\nstrong  and  unpleasant smell.  I would  like  the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nenlighten  the House how the situation I cited along Jalan  Boon\r\n\r\nLay could be improved after the passage of this particular Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not all the plants burn fuel. Take the example of a\r\n\r\nconcrete mixing plant in the premises of a pre-mixed company  or\r\n\r\nin  a  construction site.  It is quite common that this kind  of\r\n\r\nplant  emits  a  huge amount of particles during the  production\r\n\r\nprocess  and  that  could  create a very  unhealthy  environment\r\n\r\neither  in a housing estate or industrial estate.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  know how the Bill is able to deal effectively with this kind\r\n\r\nof pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the area of water pollution, it does not mention\r\n\r\nabout one of the important aspects of pollution known as thermal\r\n\r\npollution.   In other words, it means that once  discharged  hot\r\n\r\nwater  goes  into  the watercourse, the thermal pollution  would\r\n\r\ncause  serious pollution problems in the watercourse because  it\r\n\r\nupsets  the  favourable living environment for  all  the  inter-related bio-organisms in the watercourse.  May I know which part\r\n\r\nof the Bill deals with this specific kind  of problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 18 (Part V) empowers the Director to order the\r\n\r\nremoval  and  clean up of hazardous materials that  pollute  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  In many cases, we know that the clean-up  will  be\r\n\r\ndone by the Singapore Civil Defence Force.  If this is the case,\r\n\r\nwho should pay for the cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  feel, just as I have said earlier, the culprit should be made\r\n\r\nto bear the cost of the cleaning up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII deals with the licensing of people who trade in\r\n\r\nhazardous substance, including hazardous waste.  I would like to\r\n\r\nknow whether the person collecting such waste must have adequate\r\n\r\nfacilities  to  treat  the waste before  a  licence  is  issued.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the consequence can be quite serious because it could\r\n\r\nlead to illegal dumping or the export of the waste for financial\r\n\r\ngain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to relate another example which may be\r\n\r\nrelated   to  the  licensing  of  collection  of  waste.    This\r\n\r\nparticular example happened not long ago.  There was a big  fire\r\n\r\nof  a huge collection of recycled wood in Lim Chu Kang.  It took\r\n\r\na  few  days for the fire brigade to put down the fire. In  this\r\n\r\ncase, luckily, the waste is not hazardous.  But we could draw  a\r\n\r\nsimilar conclusion if the collector of waste does not treat  his\r\n\r\ncollected  waste  properly.  In my opinion,  the  recycled  wood\r\n\r\ncollector  was  given a licence to collect  waste  wood  and  he\r\n\r\ncharged  $40  for  every  ton of waste  wood  delivered  to  his\r\n\r\npremises.    However,  the  licensee  did  not  have  sufficient\r\n\r\nproduction  capacity  to recycle the wood into  some  marketable\r\n\r\nproducts.  Perhaps, the fire \"accident\" helped to solve the huge\r\n\r\npile-up problem of this particular collector.   In this case, we\r\n\r\nwere lucky because this was not hazardous waste.  If it was, the\r\n\r\ndamage  to  the  health  of our fellow Singaporeans  would  well\r\n\r\nexceed  anything that money could compensate.  I would like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to clarify in what way a licence would be issued  to  a\r\n\r\nhazardous waste collector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Schedule to the Bill, the ozone depleting\r\n\r\nmaterials  are  listed.  I would like to know how  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould  regulate  the  use  of  such  controlled  materials,   in\r\n\r\nparticular CFC 11 and CFC 113.  I ask this because CFC 11 is the\r\n\r\ngas used in the production of polyform for packaging purpose and\r\n\r\nalso  for the cups and plates that we use in the hawker  centres\r\n\r\nand  canteens.  Should  we regulate and discourage  the  use  of\r\n\r\npolyform?  CFC 113 is the solvent used extensively in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nelectronic industry for the cleaning of printed wiring assembly.\r\n\r\nWhat is the policy of the Ministry in encouraging the industries\r\n\r\nto  phase  out the use of CFC 113 and to replace  it with  other\r\n\r\nmore environmental friendly solvents?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last point I would like to raise is that the Bill\r\n\r\nalso  mentioned  about the qualified person and  the  registered\r\n\r\ninspector.   Could the Minister enlighten the House  how  should\r\n\r\nthese qualified persons and registered inspectors be chosen?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in  principle, I support this  Bill  to  control\r\n\r\npollution  to  the environment, as it will further  improve  our\r\n\r\nenvironment and hygiene, to the benefit of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is this Bill seems to give too wide and too\r\n\r\nmuch  power to the enforcement officers of the Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  People in the trade are worried that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials  may  nit-pick and enforce these pollution  prevention\r\n\r\nand  public health regulations in an inhumane manner.   If  that\r\n\r\nis  the case, then the traders will have to spend a lot of  time\r\n\r\nand money just to comply with the various rules and regulations,\r\n\r\nand  live  in  constant  fear of being booked,  fined  and  even\r\n\r\nimprisoned for infringement against any of these rules.    Faced\r\n\r\nwith  escalating business cost and intense competition from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries, the traders often find it difficult  to\r\n\r\nput up with the complicated rules and regulations of the various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.  They hesitate to develop their business\r\n\r\nplans  and  even lose their original spirit of entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed regrettable!   I therefore hope that the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  the Environment will be more considerate to the traders when\r\n\r\nthey  enforce the various regulations.  They should not  neglect\r\n\r\nthe possible adverse effect to Singapore's effort to enhance our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and to develop a creative business environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Lunar New Year is barely a week away. For\r\n\r\nreasons well known to all of us, the market this year is not  so\r\n\r\ngood, and the coming year may\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwell be another difficult year for us.  However, whether it is a\r\n\r\ngood year or a bad year, in accordance with Chinese customs  and\r\n\r\ntradition,  we still have to create a flourishing  and  bustling\r\n\r\nfestive atmosphere for the New Year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is, during the Lunar New Year festive season this\r\n\r\nyear,  we may still be able to go to Chinatown to shop  for  New\r\n\r\nYear  goodies,  and  bring our family  to  the  River  Hong  Bao\r\n\r\nfestival  to  soak  in the spring in the air, but  unfortunately\r\n\r\nbecause of a new order by the Ministry of the Environment,  with\r\n\r\neffect from this year, whether at Chinatown or at the River Hong\r\n\r\nBao festival, we will not be able to buy freshly roasted bak kua\r\n\r\nor barbecued pork anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to know what is the rationale\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry to ban the roasting of barbecued pork.  Is  the\r\n\r\nroasting of barbecued pork causing environmental pollution?   Or\r\n\r\nare there other reasons?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a society which is particular about presenting\r\n\r\nfacts   in   the  proper  perspective.   Whenever  a  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment promulgates any rules or policies, particularly those\r\n\r\nthat  have direct impact on the daily lives of the people, these\r\n\r\npolicies  will have to be clearly explained to the people,  lest\r\n\r\nthey be misunderstood as acts to disturb the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, assuming that the Ministry bans the\r\n\r\nroasting  of  barbecued  pork  on the  ground  of  environmental\r\n\r\npollution, then I would like to know, among the problems of  air\r\n\r\npollution  in  Singapore,  what  percentage  is  caused  by  the\r\n\r\nroasting of barbecued pork.  Or, more specifically, what is  the\r\n\r\nair pollution index caused by roasting of barbecued pork?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the roasting of barbecued pork does not cause air\r\n\r\npollution, or the extent of pollution is negligible, then why is\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry banning the roasting of barbecued pork?  If it  is\r\n\r\nsaid  that it has something to do with health problems, such  as\r\n\r\nfood poisoning or spreading of infectious diseases, then I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask the Ministry to provide the relevant data to  show\r\n\r\nhow many people had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactually  suffered  from  food poisoning  or  contacted  certain\r\n\r\ninfectious  disease  by eating barbecued  pork  roasted  at  the\r\n\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the act of roasting is really causing serious problems\r\n\r\nto  our environment and hygiene, then why does the Ministry  not\r\n\r\ntake  action  against the other acts of roasting,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nroasting of chicken-wings, suckling pigs, otak, satay, etc?  Why\r\n\r\nare  people still allowed to hold barbecue parties at  the  East\r\n\r\nCoast  Park,  and  the  holiday chalets at  Changi  Village  and\r\n\r\nSentosa?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we often say we want to preserve our\r\n\r\ntraditions.  Yet, we are breaking our traditions all  the  time.\r\n\r\nLike  the tossing of yu sheng or raw fish, the roasting  of  bak\r\n\r\nkua is very much a part of the custom when the Chinese community\r\n\r\ncelebrates  the Lunar New Year in Singapore.  It is a  tradition\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very  much  alive.   We should  cherish  such  living\r\n\r\ntradition, rather than killing the tradition now and then trying\r\n\r\nto  restore it a few years later for any intent or purpose.   It\r\n\r\nis  always  difficult to resurrect a dead tradition.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthis  is  why  some learned people are strenuously opposing  the\r\n\r\nTourism  Board's  plan to transform Kreta Ayer  into  a  tourist\r\n\r\nattraction which is neither fish nor fowl.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have side-tracked. Let me return to the subject. I feel\r\n\r\nthat  if the Ministry of the Environment does not have very good\r\n\r\nreasons,  then  there is actually no need to ban  the  barbecued\r\n\r\npork sellers from roasting their pork in public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I urge the Ministry of the Environment\r\n\r\nto review this policy and try to adopt more flexible measures to\r\n\r\nenable  the shopkeepers or hawkers to provide instantly  roasted\r\n\r\nsteaming-hot barbecued pork to the consumers during this festive\r\n\r\nseason, so that we may still be able to salvage some moments  of\r\n\r\njoy  and  happiness with the aroma generated by the roasting  of\r\n\r\nbarbecued pork, as we embark on another difficult year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me take this opportunity to wish Mr Speaker\r\n\r\nand  all  Members  of  this  House:  Gong  Xi  Fa  Cai,   and  a\r\n\r\nprogressive new year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like many of the Members\r\n\r\nwho  have spoken before me, I share the view that Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngenerally  a  good  record in environmental  pollution  control.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially so considering we are a very densely  built\r\n\r\ncity  and  a  hub  of industrial activity.  This  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfortuitous, not an act of fortune.  This good record is based on\r\n\r\na  combination of law, policy, administrative strength,  science\r\n\r\nand  engineering.  When these come together, then it is possible\r\n\r\nto have both growth and a good environment record.  And the Bill\r\n\r\nis  a  further step in making sure this continues  even  as  our\r\n\r\neconomic growth seeks new avenues and industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, the Bill is a welcome Bill in an effort to\r\n\r\nupdate  and consolidate different laws for air, water, hazardous\r\n\r\nwastes, and to integrate the management under one Act, under one\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and under one approach.  I have three basic  comments\r\n\r\nas  regards,  firstly, standards; secondly,  the  approach;  and\r\n\r\nthirdly, on some particulars of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the question of standards. As the Member, Mr\r\n\r\nHeng,  said,  the  question  is in the  details.   When  we  set\r\n\r\ncontrol,  we  have  to  ask what standards  we  are  asking  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to enforce.  In this regard, I would like the Minister\r\n\r\nto  clarify how Singapore's pollution control standards  measure\r\n\r\nup  against  other  countries, and  particularly  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  and cities in these developed countries.  It  is  too\r\n\r\neasy, I think, to look at developing countries to say that  they\r\n\r\nare more polluted than us, and then to feel very self-satisfied.\r\n\r\nAs  we upgrade, for Singapore in the 21st century, we will  have\r\n\r\nto  pitch  the quality of life that can compete with  the  best.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  would ask the Ministry to constantly review and  upgrade\r\n\r\nthe standards when needed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question, in terms of standards, is the need for\r\n\r\nbest practices, given the limited space and a growing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npopulation.  In other words, it is not just the standard we set,\r\n\r\nbut  the  practices and methods of production used by industries\r\n\r\nand  by households, by all polluters or would-be polluters.  So,\r\n\r\nin this era, where we are moving from low-end industries and de-emphasising  this  kind  of  production  to  the  upper  end  of\r\n\r\nindustries, such as chemical and pharmaceuticals, this can  also\r\n\r\nbe  a  source of pollution.  I would like the assurance  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister that, together with the Economic Development Board  and\r\n\r\nother  economic  agencies,  these questions  of  production  and\r\n\r\nprocess are being thought of, even as we invite these industries\r\n\r\nto  come  to  Singapore.   Because while  the  Bill  focuses  on\r\n\r\npollution control, that is, monitoring after the fact,  it  must\r\n\r\nbe  done in an investment friendly way.  This comes to my second\r\n\r\npoint, that of the approach of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, this Bill integrates, but we can question\r\n\r\nwhether  it goes far enough.  There may be on one hand too  much\r\n\r\ndetails;  on another hand, there may be not enough breadth.   In\r\n\r\nterms  of breadth, for example, while the greatest problem  that\r\n\r\nSingapore has faced recurrently over the last decade is the haze\r\n\r\nfrom Indonesia, this problem is of such a size that whatever  we\r\n\r\ndo  about  our  own vehicular emissions or bak kua  sellers,  or\r\n\r\nwhatever, these are dwarfed completely by the problem.   And  if\r\n\r\nthe Minister, I hope, recognises, this Bill does not go any step\r\n\r\ntowards helping us to deal with this problem, such as making the\r\n\r\nBill  apply  to  the act, and our regulations apply  to  whoever\r\n\r\npollutes our air, no matter where the pollution comes from.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other element in which this Bill may not go far enough\r\n\r\nis  that  pollution control can sometimes be only an end-of-the-pipe  solution,  that  is, only after the pollution  is  already\r\n\r\ngenerated, do we worry about where it is put.  There is a  need,\r\n\r\ntherefore, to control production processes further up the  chain\r\n\r\nof  production.   There is a need to control use and  production\r\n\r\nprocesses  and  to  integrate land use and planning.   Sustained\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in  the  sense  requires much  more  inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncoordination.  My understanding is that there is,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin   administrative   matters,  a  close  coordination   between\r\n\r\nenvironmental  pollution  control under  the  Minister  and  his\r\n\r\nMinistry and the land use planning authorities which fall  under\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  National Development.  I would  ask  for  the\r\n\r\nMinister's reassurance that this coordination will continue  and\r\n\r\nin fact grow over the next decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question in terms of approach relates to clauses\r\n\r\n26 and 36 of the Bill.  Under these clauses, as the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid,   identified  persons  can  be  directed  to  assess   the\r\n\r\nenvironmental pollution effects of their activities.  This is  a\r\n\r\nwelcome  step.   This takes us in a direction of  assessing  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental  impact  of projects, or  what  is  known  as  EIA\r\n\r\n(Environmental Impact Assessment).  However, while this  is  the\r\n\r\nright  step,  my concern is that it does not go  far  enough  in\r\n\r\nfostering transparency, public information and participation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trends in international environmental law and in\r\n\r\nvarious  other documents from other countries suggest that  when\r\n\r\nthe public is informed, the public has access to information and\r\n\r\nthe  public participates, this helps both the polluter  and  the\r\n\r\npublic.   The public feels more ownership over the problem,  can\r\n\r\npropose  solutions,  and the polluter feels  more  strongly  the\r\n\r\ngenuine  community  involvement in  asking  him  to  conform  to\r\n\r\ncertain standards.  The Bill, as it is drafted, leaves it  still\r\n\r\nvery  much  to  the Government to bring down the  stick  on  the\r\n\r\npolluter.    And  it  does  not  actually  help   in   fostering\r\n\r\nunderstanding among the public or a willing compliance from  the\r\n\r\nproducer.  I think that if we move towards greater transparency,\r\n\r\npublic  information and participation, Singapore  citizens  will\r\n\r\nmore  greatly  appreciate the hard work and the  very  necessary\r\n\r\nwork that the Ministry is doing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question in terms of approach is that the Bill,\r\n\r\nexcept for clause 37, still emphasises command and control, that\r\n\r\nis, after a certain standard is set, inspectors and other people\r\n\r\nmust be deputised to make sure they are being met.  Clause 37 is\r\n\r\nan exception because it emphasises the need for self-monitoring.\r\n\r\nI think that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommand  and  control methods are expensive  and  not  the  best\r\n\r\npractice.  We need to re-emphasise self-monitoring and  we  need\r\n\r\nschemes  for companies to find it in their interest to bring  in\r\n\r\nthe  right technology and consultants, if necessary, to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  processes  for both better environmental  protection  and\r\n\r\nbetter efficiency.  This is not therefore necessarily a negative\r\n\r\ngame  where the Ministry punishes and the producers suffer.   Or\r\n\r\nif  not, then the producers pollute and the people suffer.  This\r\n\r\ncan  be made into a positive game in which companies prosper and\r\n\r\nthe people are spared pollution.  But for this game to be put in\r\n\r\na  win-win  situation,  there needs to be  greater  emphasis  on\r\n\r\ntechnology  and  consultancy.  There are some  existing  schemes\r\n\r\nunder  the Ministry.  I would urge the Ministry to review  these\r\n\r\nschemes   and,  if  necessary,  to  ask  for  greater  financial\r\n\r\nincentives  to  be  put  to  this  good  use.   These  financial\r\n\r\nincentives I realise might not be under the Minister  but  under\r\n\r\nhis colleague, the Minister for Finance, or MTI.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to specifics of the Bill. Clause 15\r\n\r\nof  the  Bill  controls  trade  effluents.   I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister's clarification whether this relates only to industrial\r\n\r\nor whether it extends to non-industrial activity.  Particularly,\r\n\r\nI would like the Minister to answer whether this would cover run-off  problems  of fertilizers and pesticides from  land.   I  am\r\n\r\nthinking particularly of the special problem posed by the  heavy\r\n\r\nrain, given our climate in Singapore, on golf courses which  use\r\n\r\nchemical  fertilizers and pesticides very near to the  catchment\r\n\r\nareas  and reservoirs.  Additionally, in terms of that provision\r\n\r\nof  water pollution, I would like the Minister to reconsider the\r\n\r\npenalties presently imposed on trade effluents.  These are  set,\r\n\r\nI  believe, at $5,000.  I think that trade effluent problems are\r\n\r\noften infringed and $5,000 may be too low.  This is particularly\r\n\r\nso given the importance of potable water in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards to clause 18, I commend the Bill in\r\n\r\nwanting to make\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsure  that  the power always exists for the Director to  require\r\n\r\nthe   removal  and  clean  up  of  toxic  substances  or   other\r\n\r\npollutants.  I want to ask the Minister, however, of  the  scope\r\n\r\nof  this clause.  Because it seems to me the clause can be  read\r\n\r\nquite sweepingly.  There is in America a very controversial  law\r\n\r\ncalled the Superfund.  This requires polluters to clean up after\r\n\r\nthe fact, that is to say, what they did was not a problem at the\r\n\r\ntime  they  did  it.  But subsequently when standards  had  been\r\n\r\nraised, they had to come back and clean up and to bear the costs\r\n\r\nof  the clean up which were not factored into their equations of\r\n\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that clause 18 could be read in such a way\r\n\r\nthat where present regulations do not set standards or standards\r\n\r\nare  relatively low, clause 18 might actually allow the Director\r\n\r\nto  go back and require the producer or occupier of that land to\r\n\r\nclean  up  to  a  new  and higher standard and  impose  cost  on\r\n\r\nproduction, post facto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 20 of the Bill, it is quite similar.\r\n\r\nThis relates to land pollution.  Some Members might recall there\r\n\r\nhave  been  some controversies in the past about land pollution.\r\n\r\nThis relates mainly to disused petrol station or chemical plants\r\n\r\nor  other store houses of this kind of substances.  There was  a\r\n\r\nperceived  gap  in legislation in the sense that the  pollutants\r\n\r\nthat  went into the land were not necessarily infringing so long\r\n\r\nas they did not then impact on water or other areas.  Given this\r\n\r\ngap,  clause  20  promises that there will be  new  regulations.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if we read clause 20, it is really just an  indication\r\n\r\nthat  the Minister will make regulations.  There are no details.\r\n\r\nI  would  like to ask the Minister whether he is able  to  share\r\n\r\nwith  us  some  idea of the details to forecast, for  both  land\r\n\r\nusers  as well as banks who hold mortgages over this land, their\r\n\r\npossible liabilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do support this Bill. An earlier Member, I think it\r\n\r\nwas Mr Heng, suggested that this Bill should be sent to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.   I do not share that view.  I believe this  Bill  is\r\n\r\nlargely   well-drafted  and  I  have,  from  past  acquaintance,\r\n\r\nconfidence the regulations of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinistry  have been generally well-balanced.  But I  would  urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister to consider, as Mr Heng also said, that the  devil\r\n\r\nis  in the details.  And as such, when the regulations come  out\r\n\r\nand  specific incidents come out, I would urge the  Ministry  to\r\n\r\nconsider having a much greater public access and a dialogue over\r\n\r\nthese  specific regulations and incidences, rather than  have  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, let me first start by thanking all\r\n\r\nMembers  who have spoken and very strongly supported  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nLet me first reply to Mr Heng Chiang Meng.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has asked that in tackling the pollution problem,\r\n\r\nwe  should  start at source, and one good way  is  to  start  by\r\n\r\neducating the young and having the adults set the example.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  totally  agree with him, which is why we have a  very  active\r\n\r\nprogramme of involving the schools in environmental issues.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  many of the schools now have environmental clubs  and  we\r\n\r\nwill continue to encourage those which do not have such clubs to\r\n\r\nform them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has commented that the Bill sounds like a\r\n\r\npunishment  Bill.   The  Bill stipulates  what  the  owners  and\r\n\r\noccupiers must do, but it does not really provide any incentives\r\n\r\nto  help  them comply with the requirements. Sir, he  is  right.\r\n\r\nThis  is a Bill to control pollution, which is why it stipulates\r\n\r\nall  the requirements, in terms of pollution control.  There are\r\n\r\nincentives.    But  the  incentives  are  contained   in   other\r\n\r\nlegislation and I will go into them afterwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng asked that we should differentiate the punishments\r\n\r\nbecause  the range of polluters is so huge and the circumstances\r\n\r\nof  the pollution are also very varied.  Sir, indeed, we will do\r\n\r\nthat.   The  law stipulates the maximum in which the  punishment\r\n\r\ncan be levied.  But in levying the punishment, we will take into\r\n\r\nconsideration the circumstances and the sort of polluter.   This\r\n\r\nis something which has been in practice and will continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked why the Bill did not include specifically\r\n\r\nthings  like  motor  vehicles since  the  pollution  from  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles is quite significant.  Sir, in drafting the clause,  we\r\n\r\nopted  to  give  a broader description.  It is  not  just  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles because down the road, there could be other sources  of\r\n\r\npollution  which we will be looking at.  This description  gives\r\n\r\nus  maximum flexibility.  But in ensuring that the message  goes\r\n\r\nthrough  very  clearly, I have spent quite some time  describing\r\n\r\nwhy  diesel  particulates are dangerous to health, and  this  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be one of the key points that we are going to focus  on\r\n\r\nin terms of pollution control on motor vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked whether the Bill applies to sea pollution.\r\n\r\nSir,  the Bill applies to pollutants discharged into drains  and\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"drains\" would be watercourses and rivers  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the sea shore, in essence.  So land-based discharge  of\r\n\r\npollutants  into the watercourses that end up in the  sea  would\r\n\r\nstill  be  caught within the ambit of this Bill.  But  pollution\r\n\r\nfrom  ships  is not covered by this Bill.  Pollution from  ships\r\n\r\nwould  be covered under another Act, which is the Prevention  of\r\n\r\nPollution  of the Sea Act and this is administered and  enforced\r\n\r\nby MPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng talked about noise pollution. Again, because of\r\n\r\nthe varying circumstances and locations where noise pollution is\r\n\r\nemitted, there should be a varying standard applicable  to  each\r\n\r\nsituation.   Sir,  indeed that is the case.  We  have  different\r\n\r\npermissible noise levels for different locations.  For  example,\r\n\r\nareas near to the homes for the aged and hospitals would have  a\r\n\r\nmuch  lower  permissible noise level than, for example,  a  site\r\n\r\nthat is in the middle of nowhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng also expressed concern that since there is a\r\n\r\nprovision  that  is  very much akin to the environmental  impact\r\n\r\nassessment  study requirement, the power to order  the  carrying\r\n\r\nout of such a study should be vested in the Minister rather than\r\n\r\nthe  Director.   Sir,  there  is no need  for  that  stipulation\r\n\r\nbecause  even when the Director makes an important  order,  that\r\n\r\norder  normally would have to be cleared by the Minister  before\r\n\r\nit is finally issued.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about punishment for persons or companies\r\n\r\nthat  submit  fraudulent data.  Yes, we have the self-monitoring\r\n\r\nequipment  and  we  are supposed to check.   What  is  there  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the  companies from tinkering with the  data  and  then\r\n\r\nsubmitting  false  data?   Sir, the companies  are  required  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  the  data  from  the self-monitoring  equipment  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  for certain operating periods.  If they go and  doctor\r\n\r\nthose  data,  they will be guilty of committing a crime  and  we\r\n\r\nwould definitely take action against them.  I must say that,  so\r\n\r\nfar,  my  Ministry  has  not encountered any  company  that  has\r\n\r\nsubmitted doctored data to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng talked about noise and he made three\r\n\r\npoints  that  for  work sites near homes,  the  work  should  be\r\n\r\nconstrained after 8.00 pm and that after 8.00 pm, no work  which\r\n\r\nemits loud noise should be allowed.  Sir, in fact, we do have  a\r\n\r\nrequirement that after 7.00 pm, the noise level from work  sites\r\n\r\nwould have to be greatly reduced.  So, in fact, we have gone one\r\n\r\nstep further than what Mr Ang has asked for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that the noise be measured at an\r\n\r\nappropriate  level rather than just on the ground  level  as  in\r\n\r\ncertain circumstances, the ground floor may be fairly quiet, but\r\n\r\nif  you  go to the upper floors, it may be very noisy.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\ntake his point and I will ask my officers to look into that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that since most work sites will have a\r\n\r\nsafety  officer, we should perhaps make the safety officer  also\r\n\r\nresponsible  for looking into the noise level emitted  from  the\r\n\r\nwork site.  Sir, my Ministry is now looking into the concept  of\r\n\r\nan  environmental control officer.  We should look into  various\r\n\r\nenvironmental aspects relating to work sites, such  as  breeding\r\n\r\nof mosquitoes.  I will ask my officers to see whether one of the\r\n\r\nduties could also be to monitor the noise level.  But we want to\r\n\r\nbe  careful  not to overburden the construction sites  with  all\r\n\r\nkinds of requirements.  The thinking is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat,  at the present moment, the environmental control  officer\r\n\r\ncan also double up as a safety officer.  Therefore, it is not  a\r\n\r\nrequirement for an additional person to be employed  but  really\r\n\r\nto broaden the role of the safety officer who is already working\r\n\r\nthere.  We will look into his suggestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low Seow Chay has cautioned against exempting the\r\n\r\nDirector   from  personal  liability  and  with  this  exemption\r\n\r\nprovision, it may encourage the Director to make a wrong or easy\r\n\r\ndecision  at the expense of the company.  Sir, I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat,  with  or  without  the  exemption  provision,  Government\r\n\r\nofficials  take  their job very seriously and they  always  make\r\n\r\ndecisions  in  good faith.  The Environmental Pollution  Control\r\n\r\nBill  has got very broad and serious implications.  I can assure\r\n\r\nhim  that the Director is definitely a person who would take his\r\n\r\njob  very seriously and would ensure that the decisions are made\r\n\r\nin a very balanced manner.  The first priority must be of course\r\n\r\nto  safeguard the health and safety of Singaporeans.  It may  be\r\n\r\nan  expensive  control measure, but if the  pollutant  is  death\r\n\r\nthreatening, we cannot take the easy way out and say, \"Well, let\r\n\r\nus  use  a cheaper equipment and let them pollute the air.\"   We\r\n\r\nwill  always  have to make sure that the first  priority  is  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  health  of our people and  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nstandards are reasonable standards.  We should not go for  ideal\r\n\r\nstandards  which  will of course require very heavy  investment,\r\n\r\nmuch heavier than is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to tie this in to what Mr Simon Tay has asked on\r\n\r\nwhat  sort  of  standards  we are  using.   We  are  basing  our\r\n\r\nstandards on those of the developed countries.  For example, for\r\n\r\nair   quality,   our   basic  standard  is  the   World   Health\r\n\r\nOrganisation's  long-term goals for air quality.   Many  of  the\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries are not close to that  yet,  but  we  have\r\n\r\nalready  adopted  that  standard as our standard,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nsupplemented by the US Environmental Protection Agency's primary\r\n\r\nair   quality   standards  as  well.    In   fact,   these   are\r\n\r\nwell-researched  standards of a very high level  but  attainable\r\n\r\nlevel, and we have adopted this as our standard.  I may as  well\r\n\r\nanswer the rest of the questions on this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For trade effluent, we use the standards of countries such\r\n\r\nas  Australia,  New  Zealand, Japan, the  USA  and  Europe.   In\r\n\r\nensuring  that  these  standards are achievable,  we  have  also\r\n\r\nlooked at the ability to comply with these standards, what  sort\r\n\r\nof  investment is needed, and our assessment has been that these\r\n\r\nstandards   are   reasonable  and  the   investments   are   not\r\n\r\noverwhelming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low has asked whether the burning of wood is covered\r\n\r\nunder  the Bill.  Yes, the burning of wood is covered in  clause\r\n\r\n14  of the Bill.  He has gone on to ask about the transportation\r\n\r\nand   storage  of  toxic  and  polluting  substances   and   who\r\n\r\ndetermines.   What system do we use?  The procedure  is  a  very\r\n\r\nwell-established one.  When a company applies for permission  to\r\n\r\nhandle,  store, or sell hazardous substances, we will first  ask\r\n\r\nthem  for  their proposal, which should include storage  system,\r\n\r\nhandling   system,  pollution  control  system  if  an  accident\r\n\r\nhappens,  and based on their proposal, we will then review.   If\r\n\r\ntheir proposal is a very rational one, we would be very happy to\r\n\r\naccept  their  proposal.  It is not our  purpose  to  run  their\r\n\r\nbusiness  for them.  Our interest is to ensure that the  systems\r\n\r\nare  in  place and the systems are reasonable and that they  are\r\n\r\nwell   structured  technically  and  capable  of   coping   with\r\n\r\naccidents.   So  we leave it to them.  But if we find  that  the\r\n\r\nproposal  is far below the minimum standards, then the  Director\r\n\r\nwould   have   to   impose  certain  requirements,   and   these\r\n\r\nrequirements would not be something which is taken out from  the\r\n\r\nair  because  much  of  the  business is  already  available  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  therefore we can use the current  practices  and\r\n\r\nequipment as a standard for the new company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked about cleaning up. If there is a discharge of\r\n\r\npollutants, then who bears the cost of the clean up? I think  it\r\n\r\nis  quite  clear.  He who pollutes must pay.  The  company  that\r\n\r\ndischarges  the  pollutants must pay for the  clean  up.   Quite\r\n\r\noften,  time  is of essence and the Ministry may  then  have  to\r\n\r\narrange for the clean-up straightaway, in which case the cost of\r\n\r\nthe clean up is then charged to the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low asked about smell pollution and he said that the\r\n\r\nBill  does  not seem to address odours.  Odours are catered  for\r\n\r\nunder  the Environmental Public Health Act and it has been quite\r\n\r\nadequate.  He gave the example of Beecham, a factory in the Boon\r\n\r\nLay  area,  that used to emit very strong smell.   Arising  from\r\n\r\nfeedback from the residents and people passing by, officers from\r\n\r\nENV went to the factory involved and worked with the factory  to\r\n\r\naddress the sources of that smell and how to control it.   I  am\r\n\r\nglad  to  say that if he drives past that area today, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink he will have that problem anymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about people who trade in hazardous\r\n\r\nsubstances  and who are collecting such waste and  whether  such\r\n\r\npersons must have adequate treatment facilities before a licence\r\n\r\nis  issued.   For companies or persons who wish to go  into  the\r\n\r\nbusiness of collecting hazardous waste, we will require them  to\r\n\r\nhave the necessary treatment facilities.  He brought up the case\r\n\r\nof  a  company who collected waste wood and had a  big  pile  of\r\n\r\nwaste  wood  which was subsequently burnt.  Sir, he  was  not  a\r\n\r\nhazardous  waste  collector. He was a waste  wood  recycler  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  circumstances were quite different.   He  had  a\r\n\r\nrecycling  facility except I do not think he  ran  his  facility\r\n\r\nvery  well and because of that, he had some problems and a  fire\r\n\r\nbroke  out.   The Government put out the fire and  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nputting out the fire and the clean up was indeed charged to  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also talked about the use of CFC 11 and CFC 113.\r\n\r\nCFC  11  has  been prohibited in Singapore and is  therefore  no\r\n\r\nlonger  used  today in the production of styrofoam.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthey use another gas which is approved.  As to the import of CFC\r\n\r\n113, it has been banned since January 1996.  However, under  the\r\n\r\nMontreal Protocol, remnant stocks are allowed to be used up.  So\r\n\r\nwhat  you  see  in Singapore that is being used are  really  the\r\n\r\nremnant stocks which would be used up in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked how the qualified persons and registered inspectors\r\n\r\nare chosen.  My Ministry conducts training courses on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhow   to   vet  plans  and  do  site  inspections,   and   those\r\n\r\nprofessionals,  architects and engineers who have  gone  through\r\n\r\nthat  training  course  would  then  qualify  to  be  registered\r\n\r\ninspector.   And we are looking into how to increase the  number\r\n\r\nof  training  programmes  so that we can  enlarge  the  pool  of\r\n\r\nregistered inspectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan is worried that with this Bill, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will nitpick and enforce in a very tough manner.   Let\r\n\r\nme  first explain that this Bill is not a totally new Bill.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  compilation  of parts from different  existing  Acts  and\r\n\r\ncompiled  into  one  Bill that handles the  entire  spectrum  of\r\n\r\npollution.    Many   of  the  clauses  are  therefore   existing\r\n\r\nprovisions  and  already operational.  Some of  them  have  been\r\n\r\noperational  since 1971, so they are well-tried and well-proven.\r\n\r\nThe  few clauses which are new are actually provisions which are\r\n\r\nalready   operational   also   but   they   are   carried    out\r\n\r\nadministratively.  What we have done is to now formalise this by\r\n\r\nconverting  those administrative requirements into law.   I  can\r\n\r\nassure  Mr Tay that the enactment of this Bill will not  in  any\r\n\r\nway change the administration of pollution control in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he went on quite a fair bit about bak kua and asked\r\n\r\nwhy  has ENV proceeded to ban the outdoor barbecuing of bak kua,\r\n\r\nespecially during the Chinese New Year season.  Sir, this  issue\r\n\r\nis   one  which  we  have  been  discussing  with  the  bak  kua\r\n\r\nmanufacturers for some time already.  In fact, I think as  early\r\n\r\nas about 1 1/2 years ago, they were pre-alerted, and about a year\r\n\r\nago,  after  the  last Chinese New Year, we  proceeded  to  hold\r\n\r\nfairly  detailed  discussions with  the  bak  kua  operators  to\r\n\r\nexplain to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbecuing of bak kua on street pavements has been in place\r\n\r\nfor a long time, as Mr Tay has mentioned.  And every Chinese New\r\n\r\nYear,   you  see  them  sprouting  around  all  over  Singapore,\r\n\r\nChinatown  and elsewhere.  These street and pavement stalls  are\r\n\r\nnot  licensed  and  they  are not housed  in  licensed  premises\r\n\r\neither.   They  spring  up, operate for a  few  weeks  and  they\r\n\r\ndisappear and we are not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  sure where they obtain their raw meat and meat patty from.\r\n\r\nAnd  this  is  the problem.  It is not the smoke pollution.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in announcing this move, ENV had made sure that both  the\r\n\r\nChinese  press and the English press and the other media carried\r\n\r\nthe  explanation  quite  clearly that it  was  a  public  health\r\n\r\nconcern,  not  smoke.  If it is smoke, that  is  really  not  an\r\n\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of hygiene at these makeshift stalls can lead to\r\n\r\nserious outbreaks of food borne diseases, not unlike those  that\r\n\r\nhad  been experienced recently in some other countries.  I  will\r\n\r\ngive  you  some examples.  The recent outbreak of Avian  flu  in\r\n\r\nHongkong  resulted  in  six deaths and the  E-coli  outbreak  in\r\n\r\nJapan,  well-known for very clean food conditions, it broke  out\r\n\r\nvery quickly, killed seven people before it stopped.  These  are\r\n\r\nvery recent examples of how such food borne diseases can quickly\r\n\r\nappear  from  nowhere and then pose a tremendous danger  to  the\r\n\r\npopulation.   As far as bak kua is concerned, there  are  proper\r\n\r\nplaces  for the food to be produced and bought and, in fact,  if\r\n\r\nyou walk down Chinatown, one would see many bak kua stalls.  The\r\n\r\nkey thing is that because the shops and stalls are licensed, the\r\n\r\npublic  can  be  assured of the proper food standards.   We  are\r\n\r\ndealing with a genuine public health concern and I think  it  is\r\n\r\nbest that we stick to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also talked about the need not to break traditions. Sir,\r\n\r\nI  agree  with him.  We would also like to keep as many  of  our\r\n\r\ntraditions  as  possible, but we think that we have  to  realise\r\n\r\nthat  over time, some of the traditional practices may  have  to\r\n\r\nchange,  for good reasons, and we should not change them  unless\r\n\r\nthere  are  good  reasons.   Firecrackers  were  a  very  strong\r\n\r\ntraditional  practice.   I  remember growing  up  where,  during\r\n\r\nChinese   New   Year's   eve,  we  were  playing   around   with\r\n\r\nfirecrackers, half the night not being able to sleep but I still\r\n\r\nenjoyed it.  But we still had to intervene because there  was  a\r\n\r\npublic  health concern.  In the case of bak kua, I do not  think\r\n\r\nhaving  that  stall  there is a tradition.  Eating  bak  kua,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  for  some people is very important, and  we  have  not\r\n\r\nstopped this.  You can still buy bak kua freely in Chinatown and\r\n\r\nin many of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsupermarkets.  I can assure Members that it is not our intention\r\n\r\nto stop the production and sale of bak kua.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay talked about standards and I have already\r\n\r\nreplied  to him.  Next, he went on to talk about best  practices\r\n\r\nand methods of production.  I want to assure him that we do work\r\n\r\nclosely  with EDB and with the other Ministries and agencies  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  whatever  we do, we are able  to  adopt  the  best\r\n\r\npractices available, but it must be a best practice that is also\r\n\r\neconomical.  We do not believe in going for the ideal  approach,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  think that would totally make us uncompetitive.    I\r\n\r\nagree with him that we must be investment friendly while at  the\r\n\r\nsame time safeguarding our environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also talked about the breadth of legislation and that we\r\n\r\ndo  not  go far enough in tackling pollution from abroad.   This\r\n\r\ntopic  has  cropped up periodically and I think we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nrealistic.  There is really no meaning to having a provision  in\r\n\r\nour legislation which we cannot enforce.  And if it is pollution\r\n\r\nfrom a neigbouring country, it is very difficult for us to go to\r\n\r\nthat neighbouring country and enforce our law if they themselves\r\n\r\nare unable to enforce their own laws.  So, I think we have to be\r\n\r\nrealistic and tackle this problem from another angle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, he said that we should not impose controls after the\r\n\r\nfact,  ie,  having the self-monitoring devices is good  but  the\r\n\r\npollution is already there.  It is after the fact, and  that  we\r\n\r\nshould do it before the fact.  We actually do that.  Whenever  a\r\n\r\nproject  proposal  is  received  by  the  EDB  and  the  various\r\n\r\nGovernment departments that has a pollution element in it,  that\r\n\r\nproject is referred to us and we will work with the company very\r\n\r\nearly  in  the  project planning stage to make  sure  that  they\r\n\r\nunderstand  what are our requirements and that they  build  that\r\n\r\ncapability to achieve our requirements into the process, because\r\n\r\nthat is the most cost effective way.  So our requirements become\r\n\r\nan  integral part of their routine production process, which  is\r\n\r\nwhy  despite our very high requirements, I think no company  has\r\n\r\ncome back to tell us that our standards are not achievable.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked that we assure him that the inter-Ministry coordination work continues. Sir, that has been an\r\n\r\nongoing   process.    There   is   very   close   inter-Ministry\r\n\r\ncoordination and we will continue with that, both  in  terms  of\r\n\r\npollution  control  and  land use.   Whenever  the  Master  Plan\r\n\r\nCommittee reviews the Master Plan, ENV is involved, as are  many\r\n\r\nother Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clauses 26 and 36 and that these are akin\r\n\r\nto  the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and that we should\r\n\r\nget  public involvement in them.  At this point, I think  it  is\r\n\r\nuseful to explain the whole process.  We have to start from  the\r\n\r\nMaster  Plan  stage.   In drawing up the Master  Plan,  the  URA\r\n\r\nalready got all the inputs from both the Government agencies  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  members of the public, because the URA would  normally\r\n\r\nproceed  to hold public dialogues when they release their  draft\r\n\r\ndevelopment  guide  plans and the Master  Plan.   So  the  macro\r\n\r\nplanning is the key point where all inputs are taken in, as well\r\n\r\nas from members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time when a specific project proposal is received,\r\n\r\nwe  are not really looking at the macro issues any more.  We are\r\n\r\nreally  looking  at the micro issues, what sort  of  pollutants,\r\n\r\nwhat  sort of process, what is the level of pollution, what  are\r\n\r\nour  standards.   These are highly technical issues.   We  have,\r\n\r\nover  the years, built up a tremendous pool of expertise in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment departments and where the expertise is still lacking,\r\n\r\nbecause  maybe it is a new pollutant, for example, then what  we\r\n\r\ndo  is  that  we  will  take in technical  experts  from  either\r\n\r\nSingapore or from abroad to advise us.  So by the time ENV  gets\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  these  issues, these are highly  technical  issues\r\n\r\nrather  than a systemic broad-based type of issue,  and  we  are\r\n\r\nvery focused in dealing with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 37, on self-monitoring equipment,\r\n\r\nand  that we should help companies to upgrade by providing  some\r\n\r\nincentives.   The  incentives are there.  Mr  Heng  Chiang  Meng\r\n\r\nmentioned that too.  Let me explain very briefly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ISO 14001, for example, we already have a scheme which\r\n\r\nis  administered  by the Productivity and Standards  Board  that\r\n\r\noffers  financial  grants  of up to  70%  of  the  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nconsultancy, subject to a maximum of $40,000.  And an additional\r\n\r\ngrant  of  50%  of  the  one-time cost for obtaining  ISO  14001\r\n\r\ncertification.  My Ministry itself administers a  scheme  called\r\n\r\nthe  Accelerated  Depreciation  Allowance  Scheme  to  encourage\r\n\r\ncompanies  to use not just energy efficient equipment  but  also\r\n\r\nmore  efficient pollution control equipment.  So this scheme  is\r\n\r\nalready in place.  There are various schemes which are available\r\n\r\nand those in the industry are quite familiar with them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talked about clause 15 and whether it applies to\r\n\r\nindustrial  and non-industrial land and whether it also  applies\r\n\r\nto  fertilisers.  I believe the clause does apply to other  than\r\n\r\nindustrial land.  On the issue of fertilisers, definitely,  yes,\r\n\r\nwe  do  control the use of fertilisers.  We make sure  that  our\r\n\r\nwater  catchment  areas and the land around the  reservoirs  use\r\n\r\nfertilisers  which  are approved by both ENV  and  PUB,  because\r\n\r\nultimately  PUB  is the agency responsible for safeguarding  the\r\n\r\nquality of our water.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned that the figure of $5,000 is not adequate. I\r\n\r\nhave  looked  at the clause that he mentioned.  The $5,000  fine\r\n\r\nrefers to people who failed to inform ENV about the incidence of\r\n\r\npollution.   It  is not for the act of polluting,  but  for  not\r\n\r\ninforming  us.  Yes, I am correct.  It says, \"shall  immediately\r\n\r\ninform\" and if he does not immediately inform, there is  a  fine\r\n\r\nof $5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pollution to inland waters, the maximum fine, as I\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  my  Second Reading speech, is actually  $100,000.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  large  sum because we need to safeguard  our  water\r\n\r\nsupplies..\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I missed out an important point made by Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  Chiang Meng, ie, to refer the Bill to a Select  Committee.\r\n\r\nI   understand  Mr  Heng's  concerns  because  the  passing   of\r\n\r\nenvironmental   control  Bills  would  be  momentous   in   most\r\n\r\ncountries,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexcept  that  in  Singapore  we  are  actually  ahead  of   most\r\n\r\ncountries.   We  started on environmental  controls  many,  many\r\n\r\nyears  ago  and  therefore this Bill is not  a  brand  new  Bill\r\n\r\ncontaining  brand new provisions.  Many of the  provisions  here\r\n\r\nare  provisions  which have been in existence for  25-30  years.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no need for us to send this Bill to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee.  However, from time to time, we do get feedback  from\r\n\r\neither  the  industry or the public or from  interested  parties\r\n\r\nwith  suggestions and proposals.  And where those  feedback  are\r\n\r\nvalid,  we  normally do note them and we would not  hesitate  to\r\n\r\ninclude  them  in  future  amendments  to  the  Bill  when   the\r\n\r\nopportunity arises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have answered most of the points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, the Minister in his reply, when I\r\n\r\nasked for different permissible noise measurements for different\r\n\r\nsituations, said that they are already doing that.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask him why his Ministry allows the (bang) drop hammer  type\r\n\r\nof  piling to be used for sites next to occupied houses as  well\r\n\r\nas  for sites next to isolated areas.  Sir, I made that noise to\r\n\r\nshow that in this Chamber, such a noise is very loud.  But if  I\r\n\r\nmake  the same noise in the middle of the road outside, I assure\r\n\r\nyou that nobody will notice it at all, because the general noise\r\n\r\nlevel is much louder than probably the noise I made just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not understand why, for example, 75 dba is\r\n\r\nallowed  for construction sites next to occupied houses as  well\r\n\r\nas  construction sites in isolated areas.  Using the drop hammer\r\n\r\nmethod  of piling, the same noise level is created.  To somebody\r\n\r\nwho  is  living next door, the noise level would be  high.   The\r\n\r\neffect  would be different for a site further away.   I  see  no\r\n\r\nreason  why the noise level for the site next to occupied houses\r\n\r\ncannot  be made much lower so that they cannot use this  method.\r\n\r\nThere  are less noisy methods of piling.  This is why I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that presently the Environment Ministry enforces different\r\n\r\nmeasurements   for  different  permissible  noise   levels   for\r\n\r\ndifferent situations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I raised the question of clauses 18 and\r\n\r\n20  in  combination.  Clause 20 recognises  a  gap  in  the  law\r\n\r\nregarding  control  of land pollution and these  have  not  been\r\n\r\naddressed in the present Bill except to say that there  will  be\r\n\r\nregulations.   Clause  18,  I  suggested,  was  quite   sweeping\r\n\r\npotentially.   I  would ask the Minister if  he  would  like  to\r\n\r\nclarify these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Mr Heng has hit the right point. I\r\n\r\nagree  with him that whilst we have standards in terms of  noise\r\n\r\nlevels  -  these  are  technical  standards  -  there  are  some\r\n\r\nshortcomings which we will need to address.  The noise standards\r\n\r\nrefer  to  average sound levels over a certain number of  hours,\r\n\r\ntogether with certain 5-minute peaks.  The sound we heard  is  a\r\n\r\nvery instantaneous noise and therefore when you average out over\r\n\r\nfive  minutes, and worse over several hours, that sound  escapes\r\n\r\nthe  standard.  I have pointed it out to my officials  and  they\r\n\r\nare looking into it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must apologise that I was too busy reading the Bill when\r\n\r\nMr  Tay  was  making his speech and I must have missed  the  two\r\n\r\npoints  that he raised.  First, on clause 20 which is the clause\r\n\r\ngoverning the remediation of contaminated land.  This is  a  new\r\n\r\nclause.  Sir, could he repeat his point on clause 20?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> This is a new area of legislation where we\r\n\r\nare  only saying that we will have regulations to be made.  Read\r\n\r\nin  combination with clause 18 it suggests that the Director can\r\n\r\norder a clean up.  My question to the Minister is whether,  read\r\n\r\nin  combination, this might mean actually the power to clean  up\r\n\r\npost facto, ie, where no standards existed before, or relatively\r\n\r\nlow  standards  existed,  we  impose  new  standards  or  higher\r\n\r\nstandards,  we  can  retrospectively ask the landowners  or  the\r\n\r\noccupiers of the land to clean up to the higher standard and  to\r\n\r\nmeet the cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the intention is to apply clause 20\r\n\r\nto  industrial land which is being rezoned for other  uses.   So\r\n\r\nwhen  the  landowner is seeking to rezone, the application  must\r\n\r\nalso  involve the Ministry of the Environment and we would  then\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nable  to  inspect  and require the landowner  to  carry  out  an\r\n\r\nassessment  of  the state of the land.  If the assessment  shows\r\n\r\nthat  certain parts of the land have been contaminated,  we  can\r\n\r\nrequire that either the owner or the occupier would have to make\r\n\r\ngood that land before approval for converting that land to other\r\n\r\nuse is allowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked whether clause 18 is meant to create a Superfund.\r\n\r\nSir,  it  is  not  the  intention  for clause  18  to  become  a\r\n\r\nSuperfund.  The clause does not provide for the setting up of  a\r\n\r\nfund  to  deal with contaminated sites.  Clause 18 empowers  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  the  Environment to require  any  person  who  has\r\n\r\ndischarged  or caused or permitted to be discharged  or  spilled\r\n\r\nany toxic substance or any other polluting matters onto any land\r\n\r\nor into any drain or sea for such persons to remove and clean up\r\n\r\nsuch substances within a specified time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the Member some background. From time to time,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of the Environment encounters contaminated  sites,\r\n\r\ndrains, etc., where we really cannot pinpoint exactly who is the\r\n\r\npolluter.   To  do  that, we need to be  on  hand  to  spot  him\r\n\r\ndischarging the pollutant.  We now have that presumption  clause\r\n\r\nthat  unless you can prove otherwise, because this is your site,\r\n\r\nyou  shall  be  responsible for the clean up.   So  this  clause\r\n\r\nallows  us  to  do  that.  We do not just presume  but  we  also\r\n\r\nrequire them to clean up the site.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> May I just ask one further clarification?\r\n\r\nDoes  it  mean  that the Ministry does not intend to  use  these\r\n\r\npowers retrospectively to meet new standards?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, we will apply the standards of the\r\n\r\nday.   For  example,  if  in two years' time,  a  factory  owner\r\n\r\napplies  to  convert  his  site into a  recreational  site,  the\r\n\r\nstandards of the day must then apply.  It cannot be the standard\r\n\r\nwhen he first bought the site.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the remaining items on the Order\r\n\r\nPaper  for  today  be exempted at this day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Provisions  for  the  control  of  water\r\n\r\npollution  have been incorporated in the Environmental Pollution\r\n\r\nControl Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage Bill seeks to, firstly, incorporate\r\n\r\nupdated  and  strengthened provisions on sewerage  and  drainage\r\n\r\nmatters   from  the  WPCDA;  and  secondly,  to  introduce   new\r\n\r\nprovisions for better management and maintenance of sewerage and\r\n\r\nland drainage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will repeal the Water Pollution Control and\r\n\r\nDrainage Act (Chapter 348).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is one of the few countries that\r\n\r\nprovides their entire population with modern sanitation.  We\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  an  elaborate system of sewers transporting wastewater  to\r\n\r\nseveral  treatment  works.  The works treat  the  wastewater  to\r\n\r\ninternationally-accepted standards before the final effluent  is\r\n\r\ndischarged  into  the sea.  We are therefore able  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nwater resources clean and free of contamination.  The result  is\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  now enjoy a high standard  of  environmental\r\n\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, my Ministry is responsible for\r\n\r\nconstructing and maintaining an elaborate network of drains that\r\n\r\ncollect  and convey rainwater quickly to the sea and reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we have eradicated floods from Singapore except for\r\n\r\na  few small low-lying areas.  These areas may still flood  when\r\n\r\nvery heavy rains coincide with high tides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sewerage and most drainage infrastructure are buried\r\n\r\nunderground  or  kept well-blended into the surroundings.   They\r\n\r\nare  often not noticed but instead taken for granted.  But  they\r\n\r\nplay  an  important part in keeping Singapore clean and free  of\r\n\r\ninfectious diseases.  The existing Act provides my Ministry with\r\n\r\nthe  necessary  powers to put the elaborate  infrastructures  in\r\n\r\nplace, maintain, operate and improve them when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sewerage and Drainage Bill (S&DB) will consist mainly of\r\n\r\nprovisions   from  its  predecessor.   It  will   regulate   the\r\n\r\nconstruction,  maintenance and improvement of  sewerage  systems\r\n\r\nand  land  drainage systems, the discharge of sewage  and  trade\r\n\r\neffluent  and other related matters.  New powers are  introduced\r\n\r\nto  prevent  damage  to or interference with  our  sewerage  and\r\n\r\ndrainage  systems and to provide for requirements now  specified\r\n\r\nunder some other Act, for example, the Building Control Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall now highlight the major new provisions that are\r\n\r\nbeing introduced in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Sewerage (Part III)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III of the Bill relates to ENV's powers to construct,\r\n\r\nmaintain, improve and control sewerage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 empowers ENV to lay pipes in, under or over any\r\n\r\npremises,  street  or building.  ENV can require  the  owner  or\r\n\r\nsupplier  of  any  gas, electricity, water or  telecommunication\r\n\r\nservices to divert or remove their wire, cable, duct, structure,\r\n\r\netc,  in  the way of any public sewerage system.  ENV  can  also\r\n\r\nrequire  the  owners or occupiers of premises to remove  similar\r\n\r\nobstructions.   The  cost  and  expenses  of  such  removal  and\r\n\r\ndiversion  will  be borne by the Government.   The  clause  will\r\n\r\nfacilitate the construction of deep tunnel sewers and allow  ENV\r\n\r\nto  serve notices on owners and suppliers of utilities which are\r\n\r\nnow private companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 12 and 15 require any person who intends to\r\n\r\nconstruct  or alter any sewerage system or sanitary  facilities,\r\n\r\nor  erect building or structure over, across or adjacent to  any\r\n\r\nsewer,  to obtain a clearance certificate or approval  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  If he fails to do so, the Ministry may require him to\r\n\r\ndemolish the sewerage system or building, or reinstate the sewer\r\n\r\nas the case may be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers ENV to enter upon any premises to\r\n\r\ninspect  any  sewerage system and open the ground if  necessary.\r\n\r\nFull  compensation will be made for any damage done due to  such\r\n\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 19, it will be an offence for any person to\r\n\r\ndischarge  any sewage, waste matter or effluent into any  public\r\n\r\nsewer  improperly  or  without  the  written  approval  of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry.   In particular, this will deter the illegal discharge\r\n\r\nof  waste  matter  into the sewers, eg, from  tankers  of  waste\r\n\r\ncollectors,  by  simply  opening  a  manhole  or  an  inspection\r\n\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 disallows the disposal of any matter or substance that\r\n\r\nis  likely  to damage the sewer, including sand, earth,  cement,\r\n\r\nbrick, wood, and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 21, it will be an offence for any person to damage\r\n\r\nany public sewer or do any act to render any public sewer to  be\r\n\r\ndangerous or injurious to health or cause a nuisance.   This  is\r\n\r\nto  ensure that due diligence is exercised when working close to\r\n\r\nsewers, eg, in construction works.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clauses enable ENV to safeguard the integrity of the\r\n\r\nsewerage  system  and  ensure that it  is  maintained  well  and\r\n\r\nfunctioning properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Drainage (Part IV)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill relates to ENV's powers to construct,\r\n\r\nmaintain and improve drainage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 24 and 25 require any person who intends to\r\n\r\nconstruct,  alter  or carry out works that affect  any  drainage\r\n\r\nsystem  to obtain a clearance certificate or approval  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  If he fails to do so, the Ministry may require him to\r\n\r\ndemolish  or  make  good  the drainage system  to  its  original\r\n\r\ncondition  or  carry  out such work as may be  necessary.   This\r\n\r\npermits  ENV  to  ensure that drains are properly  designed  and\r\n\r\nconstructed and obstructions to smooth flows are removed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 31, it will be an offence to cause any damage\r\n\r\nto  any  drainage  system.

Part  VI\r\n\r\nof  the  S&D  Bill  regulates works affecting the  sewerage  and\r\n\r\ndrainage   systems.   Clause  33  empowers  ENV   to   establish\r\n\r\nspecifications  for both sewerage and drainage works  and  issue\r\n\r\ncodes  of  practice for professionals engaged in the design  and\r\n\r\nconstruction of such works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 states that a clearance certificate or approval\r\n\r\nis  required  for  any  sewerage or drainage  work.   Clause  35\r\n\r\nspecifies  that  any work that requires a clearance  certificate\r\n\r\nshall  not  be  carried out, except under the supervision  of  a\r\n\r\nqualified person.  Clause 36 spells out the responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nthe  qualified person for the proper construction and inspection\r\n\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These clauses are similar to provisions in the Building\r\n\r\nControl Act, under which these requirements are currently  being\r\n\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enforcement (Part VII)</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 39, 40 and 41 give authorised officers powers of\r\n\r\ninvestigation  and  arrest.

In those days,  there\r\n\r\nwere still many, many homes with the manual bucket system served\r\n\r\nby  nightsoil  carriers, and being one probably meant  that  you\r\n\r\nwere at the lowest rung of the social and job ladder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily for me, her tactics worked. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nluckily for Singapore, she was not entirely right in her opinion\r\n\r\nof  the  low social status of a career in wastewater management.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we  would  not  be  at  where  we  are  today;  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  having modern sanitary facilities in  their  homes\r\n\r\nand   workplaces,  a  system  of  well-designed   and   well-run\r\n\r\nwastewater  treatment facilities and even  now  planning  beyond\r\n\r\nthis to a future of deep tunnel sewerage systems.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1950s, only buildings in parts of the city and\r\n\r\neastern  Singapore enjoyed water borne removal of  human  wastes\r\n\r\nthrough  sewers.   The  greater part of the  country  was  still\r\n\r\nserved  by  the  manual bucket system.  The transformation  from\r\n\r\nthat  scenario to where we are today is no small feat.  It could\r\n\r\nonly be possible with the entry and retention of top brains  and\r\n\r\ngood people in the industry and the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that, we have to thank the people in the Ministry of the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  They have done a good job and we should appreciate\r\n\r\nwhat they have done for us.  For those who do not, I suggest you\r\n\r\nvisit  the toilets in the rural areas of some countries  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   You  will then have a good idea of  what  going  to  a\r\n\r\ntoilet for most Singaporeans was like in the fifties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have, of course, changed for the better. We are now more\r\n\r\ndemanding  in  matters  of health, especially  those  of  public\r\n\r\nhealth.   Rightly so, Sir, and that is why this Bill  should  be\r\n\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to ensure that Singaporeans are entitled to\r\n\r\nmodern  sanitary  facilities  with  the  appropriate  wastewater\r\n\r\ntreatment facilities in such a manner that the moment  we  flush\r\n\r\nour  toilets, all things are taken care of.  Except, of  course,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  toilet bowl is choked; but then, that is a  different\r\n\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is exciting, both in the boldness and the scale of the\r\n\r\nconcept,  and the proposal, is what the Ministry intends  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  the  Deep Tunnel Sewerage Scheme.  The benefits from  this\r\n\r\nscheme are many.  With this scheme, in which the collection  and\r\n\r\ntreatment of wastewater will be deep under ground, air pollution\r\n\r\nand  health  risks will be minimised.  Land currently  used  for\r\n\r\nwastewater  treatment plants, including the buffer zones,  could\r\n\r\nbe  released  for other types of development.   I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development will be happy with that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the freeing of such land for residential and other clean\r\n\r\nuses, we can expect that residents living near such\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntreatment  plants will be overjoyed.  Not only would  they  lose\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of having their noses assaulted by the foul smell\r\n\r\n-  my  apologies to Professor Low - emanating from the treatment\r\n\r\nplants;  but  they can also look forward to an increase  in  the\r\n\r\nvalue of their properties.  The Government, too, will benefit by\r\n\r\nhaving more land for other uses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think that the Ministry should also use the\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  the  DTSS  (Deep  Tunnel  Sewerage  Scheme)  to\r\n\r\nseparate   domestic   wastewater  from  industrial   wastewater.\r\n\r\nBecause  domestic wastewater is free of heavy  metal  and  other\r\n\r\ntoxins,  it  is  cheaper to treat domestic wastewater  for  more\r\n\r\nextensive recycling than what we are doing now.  If we  consider\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of water that is used in flushing, the recovery  of\r\n\r\nwater from this source is not something to be sniffed at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister had explained, clause 5(2)(b) which empowers the\r\n\r\nDirector  to  tunnel  or  bore under  any  premises,  street  or\r\n\r\nbuilding, taken together with clause 5(5), will pave the way for\r\n\r\nthe   scheme.   I  envisage  that  when  the  scheme   commences\r\n\r\nconstruction,  there will be inconveniences  created  for  some.\r\n\r\nSir,  for the sake of a better system for all, I would urge  all\r\n\r\nthose affected to bear with such inconveniences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I think the DTSS is a win-win solution to the\r\n\r\nmanagement of waste water treatment for the Government  as  well\r\n\r\nas for the people.  However, I understand that the total cost of\r\n\r\nthe scheme may be in the region of about $6-$7 billion.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to hear the Government issuing a categorical statement like\r\n\r\nwhat  it  did for the construction of the MRT - that such  costs\r\n\r\nwill be considered as infrastructural costs and eventual charges\r\n\r\nto  consumers will be based on recovery of operating costs,  not\r\n\r\ntotal costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also glad to see the inclusion of clause 5(7)\r\n\r\nunder which compensation is paid to those adversely affected  by\r\n\r\nthe construction and the maintenance of public sewerage systems.\r\n\r\nSir,  it is better than asking aggrieved parties to seek redress\r\n\r\nunder civil law.  However, I do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsee  the need to resort immediately to the courts in case  of  a\r\n\r\ndispute, as provided under clause 49.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must remember that the Government is a huge machinery\r\n\r\nand  going  to  court  may  be  a matter  of  routine  for  many\r\n\r\nMinistries.   On  the  other hand, those  affected  may  be  the\r\n\r\naverage Singaporean with a property which happens to lie in  the\r\n\r\npath  of  the construction and/or maintenance of public sewerage\r\n\r\nsystems.  Sir, if he disputes the compensation amount, to expect\r\n\r\nhim  to resort immediately to the courts may be too much to  ask\r\n\r\nfor.   He  may not have the financial means to do so.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nresorting  to the courts is still quite foreign to  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  especially  taking  on  the  Government  that   he\r\n\r\nrespects.   Sir,  this is something desirable that  the  average\r\n\r\nSingaporean  will  not want to take on the  Government  that  he\r\n\r\nrespects and we should not encourage Singaporeans to go  to  the\r\n\r\ncourts at the slightest excuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think a better way would be to provide for a panel\r\n\r\nof  arbitrators.  Those unhappy with the compensation amount can\r\n\r\nthen  appeal to this panel for a review.  Only when the  dispute\r\n\r\ncannot be resolved at this level, should the conflicting parties\r\n\r\nresort  to  the  courts.  We are moving  towards  a  more  civil\r\n\r\nsociety with greater mediation between conflicting parties.   My\r\n\r\nsuggestion  would  be  in line with such  goals.   I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinister should consider this option.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also provides for drainage, both to prevent\r\n\r\nflooding  as  well as to collect as much water  as  possible  to\r\n\r\naugment  whatever sources of water we currently have.   On  this\r\n\r\nissue, I have a point to make.  It concerns the covering or  the\r\n\r\nabsence of covering of the drains in our housing estates.   Some\r\n\r\ntime ago, the policy was to cover all drains in order to protect\r\n\r\nthe  integrity of our water sources, of which the surface runoff\r\n\r\nwater   into   the   drainage  system  was  one   such   source.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, to reduce the incidence of mosquito breeding,  the\r\n\r\ncovers were removed which is the current policy.  My question is\r\n\r\nthis:   Does  this mean that the protection of the integrity  of\r\n\r\nwater from this source is no longer important?  Is the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncurrent  policy  the  best solution to  handle  two  conflicting\r\n\r\ndemands?   Is  there no better solution?  Perhaps  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwould like to enlighten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if possible, I would like the former policy of\r\n\r\ncovering  the  drains  be  reinstated.  Besides  protecting  the\r\n\r\nintegrity  of  protecting our water resources, it has  also  the\r\n\r\nadded  advantage  of  protecting the residents  in  our  housing\r\n\r\nestates.   Since  the  removal  of  such  covers,  accidents  of\r\n\r\nresidents,  especially the older folks, falling into the  drains\r\n\r\nhave  increased.  Sir, this is especially important in the light\r\n\r\nof our aging population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also concerned with clauses 37 and 38. These are\r\n\r\nnew  clauses relating to the registration and work of  plumbers.\r\n\r\nDoes it mean that, with the enactment of these clauses, one  can\r\n\r\nno  longer  be a \"do-it-yourself\" person with regard  to  simple\r\n\r\nplumbing  repair  jobs  in the house.  For  example,  would  the\r\n\r\nchanging of washers in taps at home or even faucet heads at home\r\n\r\nby  the  home  owner become offences under this  law?   Must  he\r\n\r\nalways  employ a registered person to do such jobs?  Sir,  could\r\n\r\nthe Minister please clarify on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise one issue regarding the\r\n\r\ninstallation  and use of food waste disposals which  at  present\r\n\r\nare  not  permitted in Singapore.  Food waste disposals  may  be\r\n\r\nquite  familiar to those who have lived abroad.  It is  a  small\r\n\r\nelectro-mechanical appliance that is installed under the kitchen\r\n\r\nsink  and  works  by pounding food waste into a  pulp  and  then\r\n\r\nflushing  it  harmlessly down the drain line into  the  sewerage\r\n\r\nsystem.   The food waste is thus pulverized into tiny  particles\r\n\r\nand   is  often  described  by  manufacturers  as  having   been\r\n\r\nliquefied.   In countries, like the USA, Australia and  the  UK,\r\n\r\nsuch disposals have been in use in households\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  many  years  and homemakers find them  to  be  a  fast  and\r\n\r\nconvenient method of getting rid of messy food wastes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the main advantage of using such an\r\n\r\nappliance  is  that  food waste can be disposed  of  neatly  and\r\n\r\nquickly,  reducing or eliminating the problem of  foul  smelling\r\n\r\ngarbage  which attracts flies, stray animals, rodents and  other\r\n\r\npests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From waste management point of view, it reduces the amount of\r\n\r\nsolid  waste  that  has  to  be  collected  and  transported  to\r\n\r\nlandfills or incineration.  For example, data from the  Plumbing\r\n\r\nFoundation,  City of New York, shows that about 45%  of  all  US\r\n\r\nhouseholds use disposals and more than 100 cities and  towns  in\r\n\r\nthe USA actually require the installation and use to help reduce\r\n\r\nthe  production of solid waste.  This should be our aim also  as\r\n\r\nan   environmentally  conscious  and  ecologically   responsible\r\n\r\nsociety.   Furthermore, it can lighten the workload  of  general\r\n\r\ncleaning  workers  in  the housing estates  and  bring  about  a\r\n\r\nsignificant  improvement  in  their  working  conditions.    Our\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National Development told me that members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic had in fact raised their concerns that this aspect  seems\r\n\r\nto have been neglected even while Singapore strives to become  a\r\n\r\nmore compassionate and caring society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the significant benefits that may be derived\r\n\r\nfrom the use of food waste disposals, I wonder why their use has\r\n\r\nbeen  disallowed  in Singapore and under this Bill  may  not  be\r\n\r\npermitted by virtue of clause 20.  In other countries  the  main\r\n\r\nconcern has been whether the use of such devices could adversely\r\n\r\naffect  the public sewerage systems, especially the older  parts\r\n\r\nof  them  which  may not be able to handle the  increased  waste\r\n\r\nload.   However, our Ministry of the Environment is planning  to\r\n\r\nspend  billions of dollars on various programmes,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nDeep  Tunnel Sewerage System to upgrade our sewerage  collection\r\n\r\nand treatment infrastructure which, I believe, should result  in\r\n\r\nthe  capability to handle any additional flow of pulverized food\r\n\r\nwaste from the use of disposals.  I would therefore like to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nask whether the Minister could consider allowing the use of food\r\n\r\nwaste disposals in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, first, let me thank both Members\r\n\r\nfor their support and comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first address the points raised by Mr Heng Chiang\r\n\r\nMeng.  He commented about the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System.  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  going  to  be a very important part  of  our  sewerage\r\n\r\ninfrastructure in the coming years and we would like  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  Deep  Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) is  optimised  in\r\n\r\nterms of its usage and capacity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he has asked whether or not the Ministry should be using\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  of the DTSS to separate domestic  waste  water\r\n\r\nfrom industrial waste water because domestic waste water is free\r\n\r\nof  heavy  metal and other toxins.  The intention of  Mr  Heng's\r\n\r\nsuggestion is that technology is developing in some parts of the\r\n\r\nworld  now where waste water can now be treated to such a  level\r\n\r\nthat it can be recycled for use in our water system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also been looking into this. In terms of whether\r\n\r\nthere  is a need for us to separate industrial waste water  from\r\n\r\ndomestic  waste water, our conclusion is that there is  no  need\r\n\r\nto.   What  we  are  doing now is that we  are  controlling  the\r\n\r\npollution  at  source.  We require companies that are  producing\r\n\r\nwaste   water  to  ensure  that  if  the  waste  water  contains\r\n\r\ncontaminants which will damage the system they should  pre-treat\r\n\r\nthe waste water before discharging into our sewerage system.  In\r\n\r\nany  case,  the  DTSS would have two treatment  plants,  one  in\r\n\r\nChangi  area and the other in Tuas area.  The Changi DTSS system\r\n\r\nwould  serve  mainly domestic premises and therefore  the  water\r\n\r\nfrom  that treatment plant would be water which can be  recycled\r\n\r\nif the technology proves feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, PUB and my Ministry will be jointly building a 10,000 cubic\r\n\r\nmetre  per  day  water reclamation pilot plant to  try  out  the\r\n\r\nconcept  that  Mr Heng has just mentioned.  The  plant  will  be\r\n\r\ncommissioned and operational in mid-2000 and after which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  will carry out a two-year study to look into the product  of\r\n\r\nthat  plant and see whether the output can also be used as  part\r\n\r\nof our supply of raw water into our reservoirs and other potable\r\n\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked whether the Government intends to treat the\r\n\r\nDTSS  like  the MRT, ie, as part of the national infrastructure.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  current sewerage system consists of the  waste  water\r\n\r\nconveyance  system  and  the waste water  treatment  facilities.\r\n\r\nWhat we are doing now is that the operating cost of the sewerage\r\n\r\nsystem  and  the  cost of building the treatment facilities  are\r\n\r\nrecovered but the cost of building the conveyance system is  not\r\n\r\nrecovered, ie, the sewers themselves are considered to  be  part\r\n\r\nof  the  national  infrastructure and not recovered.   With  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  of  the DTSS, the same procedure will be adopted,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  deep  tunnel will be considered to be part of the  national\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  and therefore we will not seek  to  recover  the\r\n\r\ncost from consumers.  We will only seek to recover the operating\r\n\r\ncost and the waste treatment facility costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng has brought up clause 5(7) which provides for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to resort to the courts in the case of a dispute, and\r\n\r\nhe  has  asked that perhaps we should examine other  avenues  of\r\n\r\nsolving  the  problems before going to the  courts.   Sir,  this\r\n\r\nclause is not new.  It is an existing clause.  I can assure  the\r\n\r\nMember that in all the years that it has been operational in the\r\n\r\nexisting  Act,  we have not had to resort to  the  courts.   Our\r\n\r\napproach is to resolve the issue of how much cost we have to pay\r\n\r\ndirectly  with the parties involved and, if necessary,  we  will\r\n\r\nseek  mediation.  We would only resort to the courts as  a  last\r\n\r\nresort.   So  I can assure Mr Heng that his point is well  taken\r\n\r\nand we will keep that in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of covering of drains in the housing estates, Mr\r\n\r\nHeng  is  suggesting that we should go back to  the  old  system\r\n\r\nwhere  the drains are covered.  Sir, basically, the covering  of\r\n\r\ndrains  involves two objectives.  One objective is  how  do  you\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  immediate  problem  of  breeding  of   Aedes\r\n\r\nmosquitoes and dengue fever can be addressed properly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe  other objective is how do we make sure that litter does not\r\n\r\nget  into our water systems.  The problem is that while  we  can\r\n\r\ncope with the litter problem by covering up the drains, most  of\r\n\r\nthe  Town Councils have found that covered drains are a  problem\r\n\r\nin  terms  of cleaning.  This is because most drains in  housing\r\n\r\nestates have got very shallow gradients and water does not  flow\r\n\r\nfast  enough  for  the  debris to be swept  away.   Is  there  a\r\n\r\nsolution to this?  I would ask my officials to look into  it  to\r\n\r\nsee  whether some middle ground can be found whereby the  bigger\r\n\r\npart of the drain can be covered up and leaving some other parts\r\n\r\nopen  to  facilitate  cleaning.  At the  end  of  the  day,  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility will really have to fall on the town councils  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  those  parts that are covered up  can  be  cleaned\r\n\r\nproperly.   We  are  prepared to be flexible but  the  onus  for\r\n\r\nmaintaining the place mosquito-free falls on the town  councils.\r\n\r\nWe  leave that flexibility to the town councils and we hope that\r\n\r\nthey will use that flexibility wisely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Heng next talked about clauses 37 and 38. These are new\r\n\r\nclauses  relating  to  the registration and  work  of  plumbers.\r\n\r\nWhile these two clauses are new, the registration and definition\r\n\r\nof  work  of plumbers are not new.  These currently exist  under\r\n\r\nregulations.   What  we  have done is that  we  have  moved  the\r\n\r\nregulations into the main body of the Bill.  Does it  mean  that\r\n\r\ndo-it-yourself jobs would no longer be possible?   Sir,  nothing\r\n\r\nwill  change  because, as I said, these are existing regulations\r\n\r\nand  we  would still follow the current practice.  The intention\r\n\r\nis  not  to  prevent simple repair jobs.  What we are  concerned\r\n\r\nabout is work involving the main system, whether it is the  main\r\n\r\nsanitation system or the main plumbing system, because  work  to\r\n\r\nthose  main  systems  has an impact on the  overall  system  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  want  to be sure that only qualified  people  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to make any alterations or repairs which can  be  quite\r\n\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min talked about food waste disposals or food\r\n\r\nwaste  grinders  and  asked why we are  so  far  behind  in  not\r\n\r\nallowing them to be used.  I think it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant to understand how this system works and why we  cannot\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  be used in Singapore.  The food waste  grinders\r\n\r\ndispose  the  food waste through the sewerage  system  by  first\r\n\r\ngrinding the solid food into tiny bits, as Mr Ong has mentioned,\r\n\r\nor  to  put  it  more  appropriately, it  liquefies  them.   The\r\n\r\nquestion is how do we liquefy solid food?  You liquefy  them  by\r\n\r\nnot  just grinding the food but using a lot of water to  liquefy\r\n\r\nand to sweep the food particles away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, water in Singapore is a very precious resource.\r\n\r\nWe  should  not  be using a lot of water to just grind  up  food\r\n\r\nparticles  and then disposing of them.  Secondly,  our  sewerage\r\n\r\nsystem  is  really not designed with the necessary  gradient  to\r\n\r\ntake  the large amount of grit which the grinders would produce.\r\n\r\nTo  do that, we have to also modify the existing sewerage system\r\n\r\nbecause  otherwise,  without the necessary  gradient,  the  food\r\n\r\nparticles  would  coagulate and choke up the  system.   Thirdly,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the additional amount of water and  grit  that  the\r\n\r\nsystem  has  to  handle, our sewerage system would  have  to  be\r\n\r\nexpanded at a tremendous cost.  The figure mentioned by Mr  Heng\r\n\r\nfor  the DTSS is between $6 - $7 billion.  To modify the  system\r\n\r\nto take the food waste, we just increase it by another 30%, that\r\n\r\nis, over  $2 billion.  The current system works very well and it\r\n\r\nis better that we work with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the experience of this system in other countries? I\r\n\r\nhave  asked that same question when I went to ENV two years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  travel, I see that system is available  in  many  other\r\n\r\ncountries.   Why  do we not have it here?  My staff  sought  the\r\n\r\nviews and comments of some of the municipal authorities in other\r\n\r\ncountries on their experience.  Sydney and Israel, for  example,\r\n\r\nhave  informed us that, on hindsight, it was not wise  to  allow\r\n\r\nits  use.   Why?  High water consumption.  When populations  are\r\n\r\nsmall, it is not a problem.  When populations increase and water\r\n\r\nresources  get  scarce,  this becomes an unnecessary  demand  on\r\n\r\ntheir water resources, and secondly, the high organic loading of\r\n\r\nthe food waste.  They regret it, but the system is in place, and\r\n\r\nthey cannot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  anything about it.  I thank Mr Ong for his inputs  but  this\r\n\r\nsystem is not appropriate for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the\r\n\r\nBill.  - [Mr Yeo Cheow Tong].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November last year, the Government announced a $10.5\r\n\r\nbillion  package to reduce business costs.  One of the  measures\r\n\r\nwas  a  10%  point reduction in the employer's CPF  contribution\r\n\r\nrate.   In order to assist owners of private properties who  are\r\n\r\nservicing  housing loans or HDB lessees paying  market  interest\r\n\r\nfor  their  mortgage loans, a bridging loan was also  announced.\r\n\r\nThis  bridging loan is a Government loan to affected  homeowners\r\n\r\nto  make up for the shortfall in CPF contribution due to the 10%\r\n\r\npoint reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum amount of bridging loan released monthly will\r\n\r\nbe the shortfall in the monthly loan instalment or the amount of\r\n\r\nreduction in the CPF Ordinary Account contribution, whichever is\r\n\r\nlesser.   The interest charged on the bridging loan is the  same\r\n\r\nas the HDB concessionary mortgage rate which in turn is computed\r\n\r\nat the prevailing CPF interest rate plus 0.1%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF (Amendment) Bill before the House today seeks to\r\n\r\namend  the Central Provident Fund Act to expand the Government's\r\n\r\nbridging  loan  to  the  borrowers' CPF  Ordinary  Account.   In\r\n\r\neffect, the bridging loan money is subjected to the same  charge\r\n\r\nas  CPF  savings released for property purchases under  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrules.  It also gives the Government, through the CPF Board, the\r\n\r\nright to recover the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbridging loan amount from the borrower's CPF accounts.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  least  cost  approach  to providing  such  a  loan  to  the\r\n\r\nhomeowners who would otherwise have to draw up another  mortgage\r\n\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to allow CPF members affected by the\r\n\r\nCPF  cut to use their CPF Special Account savings to service the\r\n\r\nmonthly  payment of the upgrading cost incurred  under  the  HDB\r\n\r\nMain Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the key clauses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill introduces section 14(a) to provide\r\n\r\nfor the Government to extend loans to CPF members under approved\r\n\r\nloan  schemes.  The new section allows the CPF Board  to  direct\r\n\r\nmonies  for  the  bridging  loan from the  Government  into  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account of a CPF member requiring such  loans.   These\r\n\r\nmonies  are deemed to be CPF contributions and may be  used  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  prescribed by regulations which include  financing\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of residential and commercial property.  This  new\r\n\r\nsection 14(a) also provides for the member's CPF contribution to\r\n\r\nbe used to repay the bridging loan and interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By deeming the money lent as CPF contributions, properties which\r\n\r\nhave  been purchased through the use of the bridging loan  will,\r\n\r\nthrough the existing provision of the CPF Act, be subject  to  a\r\n\r\nstatutory charge to secure the refund of those monies to the CPF\r\n\r\naccounts  of  the borrowers.  This would allow  the  CPF  Board,\r\n\r\nacting on behalf of the Government, to recover the bridging loan\r\n\r\nand  interest directly from the borrowers' CPF accounts if  they\r\n\r\nfail to repay or breach the terms and conditions of the loan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under the CPF Act, a member may withdraw his or\r\n\r\nher  CPF savings in a lump sum upon attaining the age of 55, and\r\n\r\nafter  setting  aside the prevailing CPF Minimum  Sum  or  if  a\r\n\r\nmember becomes physically or mentally incapacitated, or is found\r\n\r\nto be of unsound mind before reaching the age of 55.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arising from the introduction of a bridging loan\r\n\r\nscheme, it is necessary to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure  that any loan taken should first be paid before the  CPF\r\n\r\nmember can withdraw his or her savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 introduces a new section 15(a) to require a CPF\r\n\r\nmember  who  has not fully repaid his bridging  loan  to  do  so\r\n\r\nbefore  he  will be allowed to withdraw his CPF savings  on  the\r\n\r\nground  that  he has become physically or mentally incapacitated\r\n\r\nor  is  found  to  be of unsound mind.  However,  a  member  who\r\n\r\nreaches  the  age of 55 will continue to be allowed to  withdraw\r\n\r\nhis  CPF savings after setting aside the Minimum Sum even if  he\r\n\r\nhas not fully repaid his bridging loan.  This is because the CPF\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  currently set at $55,000 is more  than  enough  to\r\n\r\ncover  the  maximum bridging loan anticipated,  which  is  about\r\n\r\n$13,000,  based on a loan of $360 per month for  a  duration  of\r\n\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a CPF member who has been declared a bankrupt\r\n\r\ncannot  withdraw his CPF savings unless the CPF Board authorises\r\n\r\nhis  withdrawal with the approval of the Minister.   Although  a\r\n\r\nbankrupt CPF member cannot qualify for a bridging loan, there is\r\n\r\na  possibility that a CPF member may become a bankrupt after  he\r\n\r\nhas  taken  on  a bridging loan.  To deal with such  situations,\r\n\r\nclause  6  of the Bill amends section 27 to require  a  bankrupt\r\n\r\nmember  to repay his bridging loan plus interest before  he  can\r\n\r\nwithdraw his CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, about 1,500 CPF members are servicing their HDB\r\n\r\nflat upgrading cost with their CPF Ordinary Account savings.  As\r\n\r\nannounced  by  DPM  Lee, in order to help CPF  members  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the CPF cut, we would allow those who have  used  up\r\n\r\ntheir  CPF  Ordinary Account savings to draw  on  their  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings to meet the shortfall in their monthly  housing\r\n\r\nloan  repayment, subject to the amount of the  cut  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  In line with this decision, I think  it  is  only\r\n\r\nrational  to  allow those who are using their  Ordinary  Account\r\n\r\nsavings  to  service the upgrading cost to also tap  savings  in\r\n\r\ntheir  Special Account.  This is provided for by clause 7  which\r\n\r\namends\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  Act  to  allow CPF members to use  their  CPF  Special\r\n\r\nAccount  savings for monthly payment of their share of upgrading\r\n\r\ncost under the HDB Main Upgrading Programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this amount of the Special Account savings which\r\n\r\ncan  be  used  will  be capped at the amount  of  the  shortfall\r\n\r\narising  from  the CPF cut to the Ordinary Account contribution.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to stress at this juncture that this  is  not  a\r\n\r\npermanent feature, in other words, allowing the Special  Account\r\n\r\nsavings  to  be used either for servicing housing loans  or  for\r\n\r\npaying  their share of the upgrading cost.  This is a  temporary\r\n\r\narrangement  because once the economy recovers and we  start  to\r\n\r\nrestore the CPF contribution rate, the existing rule where  only\r\n\r\nCPF Ordinary Account savings can be used for upgrading works  or\r\n\r\nservicing housing loan will apply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the CPF Act provides for the General\r\n\r\nManager  of the Board and Board members to sign legal  documents\r\n\r\nwhich  require the CPF Board's seal.  Such legal documents could\r\n\r\nbe  deeds of arrangement and deeds of postponement which set out\r\n\r\nthe  distribution of sales proceeds of the property between  the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  and the mortgagee financier under the  CPF  Property\r\n\r\nScheme.  This arrangement had resulted at times in inconvenience\r\n\r\nwhen  the General Manager and Board members were not present  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Clause 2 of the Bill therefore amends the CPF Act to\r\n\r\nenable any Deputy General Manager of the CPF Board to sign legal\r\n\r\ndocuments  which  require the Board's seal in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nGeneral Manager and Board members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, the amendments proposed in the Bill\r\n\r\nwill  ensure  that  the  bridging loan  money  extended  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  CPF  members is protected.  The  amendment  will\r\n\r\nallow  members who are using their CPF Ordinary Account  savings\r\n\r\nfor  the  upgrading  cost  of their HDB  flats  under  the  Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme to use their Special Account savings to meet\r\n\r\nthe shortfall in their monthly instalment payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the amendment will also enable the Board to be more\r\n\r\nefficient in its administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CARRIAGE BY AIR (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br>5.02 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr John Chen Seow</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Phun):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Carriage By Air Act (Chapter\r\n\r\n32A  of  the  1989  Revised  Edition)  to  give  effect  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Montreal Protocol No. 4 which amend the Warsaw\r\n\r\nConvention  (relating  to  international  carriage  by  air)  as\r\n\r\namended by the Hague Protocol (which is referred to in the  Bill\r\n\r\nas the \"Warsaw (Hague) Convention\").\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Montreal Protocol No. 4, which deals with the\r\n\r\ninternational carriage by air of cargo and baggage,  amends  the\r\n\r\nWarsaw  (Hague) Convention to allow electronic air  waybills  to\r\n\r\nreplace  the  traditional paper air waybills, thus removing  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  air waybills to physically accompany shipments.  This\r\n\r\nprovides  greater  convenience to shippers, freight  forwarders,\r\n\r\nconsignees  and  airlines.  It also reduces cost  and  increases\r\n\r\nefficiency of the shipment of air cargoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protocol also amends the Warsaw (Hague) Convention to\r\n\r\nintroduce  strict  liability  for  the  carriage  of  cargo  and\r\n\r\nexpresses the limit of the carrier's liability in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nIMF's  Special  Drawing  Rights (SDR)  instead  of  US  dollars,\r\n\r\nwithout changing the limits of the carrier's liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's trade environment, manufacturers increasingly\r\n\r\nseek  just-in-time delivery and related strategies  as  ways  of\r\n\r\nenhancing  efficiency and reducing business costs.

The\r\n\r\nclause  deems  the  Bill  to have come into  operation  on  12th\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998  and provides that the Bill  should  not  affect\r\n\r\nrights  and liabilities arising out of an occurrence which  took\r\n\r\nplace before that date.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends the long title to incorporate the reference\r\n\r\nto the Montreal Protocol No. 4.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 reorganises the definitions in section 2 by\r\n\r\nreplacing the existing definitions of \"Convention\" and  \"amended\r\n\r\nConvention\" with the new definitions of \"Warsaw Convention\"  and\r\n\r\n\"Warsaw  (Hague) Convention\" respectively and further inserts  2\r\n\r\nnew definitions of \"Montreal Protocol No. 4\" and \"Warsaw (Hague)\r\n\r\n(Montreal) Convention\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 3 to provide that the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Warsaw (Hague) (Montreal) Convention shall have the force of\r\n\r\nlaw  in Singapore; and if there is any inconsistency between the\r\n\r\ntext of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWarsaw  (Hague) (Montreal) Convention as set out  in  the  Third\r\n\r\nSchedule  and the Montreal Protocol No. 4, the authentic  French\r\n\r\ntext shall prevail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 4 to empower the Minister to\r\n\r\ncertify  who  are  the Parties to the Warsaw (Hague)  (Montreal)\r\n\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 to 14 deal with consequential and drafting\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 inserts a new Third Schedule containing the text\r\n\r\nin English of the Warsaw (Hague) (Montreal) Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the amendments of the Carriage By Air\r\n\r\nAct  to  give  effect  to the amendments made  by  the  Montreal\r\n\r\nProtocol  No.  4 to the Warsaw (Hague) Convention would  benefit\r\n\r\nour air cargo industry by facilitating the transition to a fully\r\n\r\nelectronic  trading environment for air cargo in Singapore.

The  efficient use of EDI would enhance  our  Changi\r\n\r\nAirport's  status as a major air hub in the region  and  further\r\n\r\nincreases its international competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr John Chen Seow Phun.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PREVENTION OF POLLUTION OF THE SEA (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>5.10 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Prevention of Pollution of the\r\n\r\nSea Act, 1990 to give\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neffect   to   the  International  Convention  on  Oil  Pollution\r\n\r\nPreparedness, Response and Co-operation (OPRC Convention)  which\r\n\r\nhas  been  adopted  by  the International Maritime  Organization\r\n\r\n(IMO)  in  1990  and  to  enable  Singapore  to  implement   any\r\n\r\ninternational agreement relating to the prevention, reduction or\r\n\r\ncontrol  of pollution of the sea and pollution from ships.   The\r\n\r\nBill also increases the penalties for various offences under the\r\n\r\nAct and provides for the fines imposed for any offence under the\r\n\r\nAct to be paid into the funds of the MPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"Exxon Valdez\" disaster in 1989 clearly demonstrated\r\n\r\nthat  oil  spills can overwhelm a country's response capability,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  resources at hand. Following this incident,  the\r\n\r\nIMO  adopted the OPRC Convention in 1990 in recognition  of  the\r\n\r\nserious  threat posed to the marine environment by oil pollution\r\n\r\nincidents  involving ships,  seaports as well  as  oil  handling\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Singapore is a major oil refining centre as well as\r\n\r\nthe   world's   top  bunkering  port.   We  therefore   have   a\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to  be  prepared  at  all  times  to  deal  with\r\n\r\npollution incidents that may arise.   This Bill gives effect  to\r\n\r\nthe necessary precautionary measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convention is designed to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding\r\n\r\nto  a  major oil pollution incident and to encourage  States  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  and  maintain an adequate capability to deal  with  oil\r\n\r\npollution emergencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires governments to establish a national system for\r\n\r\nresponding  promptly and effectively to oil pollution incidents.\r\n\r\nAs  a  basic  minimum, this includes the creation of a  national\r\n\r\ncontingency  plan.   In  addition,  seaports  and  oil  handling\r\n\r\nfacilities  have  to  maintain  Oil  Pollution  Emergency  Plans\r\n\r\n(OPEPs) if there exist risks of oil pollution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPA has revised its Marine Emergency Action Procedure\r\n\r\n(MEAP) to incorporate the provisions of the OPRC Convention.  In\r\n\r\nthe  process, they have consulted various Government departments\r\n\r\nand   corporations   including  Jurong  Port,   CAAS   and   PSA\r\n\r\nCorporation, which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  responsibilities in the MEAP, as well as  private terminal\r\n\r\noperators  which provide oil handling facilities.   This  is  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  all  parties concerned are  ready  to  accept  the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  required  of  them  under  the  revised  MEAP.\r\n\r\nTerminal  operators have now developed the OPEPs in anticipation\r\n\r\nof Singapore's accession to the OPRC Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a party to this Convention, Singapore will have\r\n\r\nobligation to give effect to the provisions of the Convention in\r\n\r\nits  laws.  The Bill contains the essential provisions  to  give\r\n\r\neffect  to the Convention. In addition, to obviate the  need  to\r\n\r\namend  the  Act  in  future  when Cabinet  approves  Singapore's\r\n\r\naccession  to  any  new  international agreement  or  convention\r\n\r\nrelating to the prevention, reduction or control of pollution of\r\n\r\nthe  sea  and  pollution from ships, the Bill also provides  for\r\n\r\nregulations  to  be  made to give effect to  such  international\r\n\r\nagreements  or conventions.  In case Members are concerned  that\r\n\r\nParliament's role as the main source of law making and its power\r\n\r\nto  oversee regulations are eroded, let me stress that this  Act\r\n\r\nasks  Parliament  for  approval  for  MPA  to  make  regulations\r\n\r\nrelating  specifically to prevention, control  or  reduction  of\r\n\r\npollution  of the sea or pollution from ships.  The  regulations\r\n\r\nenacted  will  not  exceed the ambit of the Act.   International\r\n\r\nagreements relating to the prevention, reduction and control  of\r\n\r\npollution,  such  as  the  International  Convention   for   the\r\n\r\nPrevention  of  Pollution  from Ships  (MARPOL)  and  OPRC,  the\r\n\r\nConvention  which we are addressing in this Bill, are voluminous\r\n\r\nand  they contain a large amount of technical and administrative\r\n\r\ndetails.   Moreover,  they are amended  frequently.   For  these\r\n\r\nreasons, it makes more sense that they be implemented by way  of\r\n\r\nregulations.  In any case, the regulations will be gazetted  and\r\n\r\nall  Members  will  have access to them so that they  can  raise\r\n\r\nissues of concern in Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that the existing section 34 already provides for\r\n\r\nregulations  to  be made to give effect to any other  treaty  or\r\n\r\ninternational  agreement which provides for the modification  of\r\n\r\nMARPOL.  Section\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n34(c)  will  extend this to other international  conventions  or\r\n\r\nagreements  specifically related to areas of pollution  such  as\r\n\r\nOPRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 of the Bill introduces other measures necessary\r\n\r\nto  deal  with  pollution of the sea or  pollution  from  ships.\r\n\r\nBesides oil terminals and refineries, cargo terminals, shipyards\r\n\r\nand  other facilities in Singapore will now be required to store\r\n\r\ndetergents,   dispersants  and  equipment  to  deal   with   oil\r\n\r\npollution. This is to enhance Singapore's oil combat capability.\r\n\r\nIt  will  not  add  additional  burden  on  cargo  terminals  or\r\n\r\nshipyards  as  such  resources are  currently  stored  at  their\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reflect the gravity of damage caused by oil pollution,\r\n\r\nclauses  4, 5, 6 and new paragraph (e) of section 34(3) seek  to\r\n\r\nprovide for increase in fines for non-compliance.  The fines for\r\n\r\nindiscriminate  discharge of oil into the sea are  increased  to\r\n\r\nreflect  the  severity as well as the increased cost  of  damage\r\n\r\ncaused  by  oil pollution and to deter any such discharge.   The\r\n\r\nBill  also provides that all fines imposed for any offence under\r\n\r\nthe  Act  or  any  regulations  made  thereunder  and  all  sums\r\n\r\ncollected under section 33 of the Act shall be paid to the  MPA.\r\n\r\nPayment  of fines to MPA will enable it to recover part  of  the\r\n\r\nclean  up  cost for oil spills from unknown sources and expenses\r\n\r\nrelated to investigation into pollution incidents.  The MPA  has\r\n\r\nconsulted the Ministry of Finance and it has no objection to the\r\n\r\nfines being paid to the MPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PUBLICATION OF NEWSPAPER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion is subject to signification of\r\n\r\nsupport  by  at  least  one Member.

It goes without\r\n\r\nsaying  that  freedom of the press is an integral, perhaps  even\r\n\r\nthe  sine qua non of the freedom of expression.  It is the press\r\n\r\nwhich will provide the people the freedom of expression that the\r\n\r\nConstitution guarantees in the widest manner possible.   As  was\r\n\r\nsaid  in a collection of essays on the American press, the right\r\n\r\nof  the people to speak out through a free press is the hallmark\r\n\r\nof  a  democratic society, and we in Singapore  claim  to  be  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic society.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is to be maintained, Mr Deputy Speaker, then it is\r\n\r\nessential  that we give our people, every citizen in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe right to speak out.  As I said, this is only possible in the\r\n\r\nwidest manner through a press which is fearless, independent, to\r\n\r\nspeak out on behalf of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The press is one of the institutions of democracy. Some\r\n\r\npeople might say that  it is the most important institution of a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  society.  It is, along with the other  institutions,\r\n\r\nthe guardian of the liberty of the people.  It must take it upon\r\n\r\nitself  the  responsibility  to  eke  out  any  injustices,  any\r\n\r\nwrongdoings committed against the people or even one  member  of\r\n\r\nthe  society,  and  to speak out against it.   This  freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression and the role\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor the press have not been won easily in the countries where it\r\n\r\nnow  obtains.   It has been won by the press in those  countries\r\n\r\nrecognising their responsibilities and their role, fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe freedom of expression through the press.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book which he calls \"An anatomy of the Press\"\r\n\r\nentitled \"Dangerous Estate\", Francis Williams, who was an editor\r\n\r\nhimself at one time, writes:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The development of the press is part of the history of\r\n\r\nnational  development.  Much more than political  constitutions,\r\n\r\nstatistics  of economic progress or demonstrations  of  national\r\n\r\nunity, the state of a country's newspapers discloses which  rung\r\n\r\nof  the  ladder of civilisation has been reached.  This  is  not\r\n\r\nonly because newspapers reflect, as they must, public taste, but\r\n\r\nbecause  the  structure  and  status  of  the  press  show  more\r\n\r\nrevealingly than almost anything else the real stage of national\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In a sense, even more profound than arises from its nature\r\n\r\nas  a  reporter of events, the press is the mirror  of  its  age\r\n\r\nbecause the degree of authority and independence it is permitted\r\n\r\nto  exercise, or is able to seize for itself and the  nature  of\r\n\r\nits  influence  of public opinion throw light in a  way  nothing\r\n\r\nelse quite does on the real balance of power within a society.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is important. The newspapers reflect and throw light\r\n\r\non  the  real  balance  of power within a  society.   It  is  by\r\n\r\nperusing the newspapers that any comer to a country will be able\r\n\r\nto  gauge  or to find out where the balance of power  lies.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  again  it goes without saying, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  the balance of power must lie with the people.  If it does\r\n\r\nnot, then it is not a democracy.  It can be anything else but  a\r\n\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Francis Williams, again in his book, sees the press \"as a\r\n\r\nweapon of freedom, a sword in the hands of those fighting old or\r\n\r\nnew  tyrannies, the one indispensable piece of ordnance  in  the\r\n\r\narmoury  of  democracy.\"  These are strong words but  they  were\r\n\r\nnecessary when the press was fighting for its freedom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of expression, Mr Deputy Speaker, which as I said,\r\n\r\nis so vital and the essence of democracy, cannot flourish unless\r\n\r\nthere  is  in  the citizens a right to know.  Now, who  supplies\r\n\r\nthis right to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknow,  if  not the newspapers?  If the newspapers fail  in  this\r\n\r\nduty  to inform the citizens the truth, and honestly, then  they\r\n\r\ncease to be a newspaper.  They become an organ of whoever is  in\r\n\r\npower  and serve not the people but the government or the  party\r\n\r\nin power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said again in this collection of essays that in\r\n\r\nthe  American press, it is a self-appointed role to  inform  the\r\n\r\npublic  about  government  activities,  thereby  sparking   open\r\n\r\ndebate.   In the middle of the last century, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  when  the  government  of  the  United  Kingdom  then  was\r\n\r\nattempting  to  control what the press would publish,  what  the\r\n\r\npress would print, the Times in an Editorial in 1852 said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The dignity and freedom of the press are trammelled from the\r\n\r\nmoment  it accepts an ancillary position.  To perform its duties\r\n\r\nwith entire independence and consequently with the utmost public\r\n\r\nadvantage,  the  press  can  enter  into  no  close  or  binding\r\n\r\nalliances  with the statesmen of the day, nor can  it  surrender\r\n\r\nits  permanent  interests to the convenience  of  the  ephemeral\r\n\r\npower of any government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were all the values that were held at the time when the\r\n\r\npress  in England were fighting to represent the people's views.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, in this \"Dangerous Estate\", talking about one of the\r\n\r\ngreat editors of the Times (Barnes was the editor), Williams has\r\n\r\nthis to say\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Barnes's influence was rooted in the conviction that a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  is  \"not an organ through which the Government  could\r\n\r\ninfluence the people but an organ through which the people could\r\n\r\ninfluence the Government\".\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in his concluding chapter, Francis Williams presents what\r\n\r\nthe present role is, because times have changed.  At one time it\r\n\r\nseemed  as though the press was becoming tyrannical in  England,\r\n\r\nit  was  trying to control policies.  And so times have  changed\r\n\r\nand the press have changed a little.  But he said the basic role\r\n\r\nremains the same.  And he concludes that the present role is:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To provide a voice for the people that even the largest\r\n\r\nadministrative monster will hear above the grinding of  its  own\r\n\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its role in society is not that of a judge but that of a\r\n\r\nminefield through which authority, great and small\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  at  every  level  of policy and administration,  must  step\r\n\r\nwearily, conscious always that a false step may blow it up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The basic commitment of journalism remains . the same. . It is\r\n\r\nto report honestly [that means, sticking to the truth as near as\r\n\r\npossible],   to  comment  fearlessly  and  to   hold   fast   to\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[This commitment to] Values call for honesty; honesty to those\r\n\r\nattacked  as  well as to those defended.  [This]  requires  that\r\n\r\nfacts  shall not be distorted.  What is said shall be said  with\r\n\r\nboth courage and fairness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members think that this is all western heresy and it is not\r\n\r\nsomething  for  us  to  follow,  may  I  tell  them  that  these\r\n\r\nprinciples  or values have been held fast in a number  of  Asian\r\n\r\nsocieties.   I  do not have to mention them all,  but  the  most\r\n\r\nclear example would be India, the greatest and largest democracy\r\n\r\nin  the world, as it has been termed very often.  And I see only\r\n\r\nin  yesterday's  paper  that when the  Pakistani  government  is\r\n\r\ntrying  to close down a newspaper, there is a procession against\r\n\r\nthe  closure led by Miss Bhutto and a number of other  political\r\n\r\nparties, and they are all united in defending the freedom of the\r\n\r\npress.   And  it is not only just these two, but there  are  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines, even Thailand and Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not just rely on what the other countries are doing.\r\n\r\nMay  I,  even  if it is tedious, again recall what  the  present\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister said about the press when he was  fighting  for\r\n\r\nthe  freedom  of the press way back in the fifties and  sixties.\r\n\r\nSpeaking  in  the then Legislative Assembly, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  Senior Minister - I regret that he  is  not  here  to\r\n\r\nlisten to what he said then - had this to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...we either believe in democracy or we do not. If we do, then\r\n\r\nwe  must  say  categorically,  without  qualification,  that  no\r\n\r\nrestraint  from any democratic process, other than  by  ordinary\r\n\r\nlaw  of  the  land,  should  be  allowed.   If  you  believe  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy,  you  must  believe in it  unconditionally.   If  you\r\n\r\nbelieve that men should be free, then they should have the right\r\n\r\nof  free association, of free speech, of free publication.  Then\r\n\r\nno  law  should permit those democratic processes to be  set  at\r\n\r\nnaught,  and no excuse, whether security, inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\ntraffic,  or  inconvenience to police officers, should  allow  a\r\n\r\ngovernment to be deterred from doing what it knows to be  right,\r\n\r\nand what it must know to be right.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking in the same year in the Assembly in October, he said - this, Mr Deputy Speaker, has often been quoted, as the \"making-\r\n\r\nlove\" speech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I am told [repression] is like making love - it is always\r\n\r\neasier  the second time!  The first time there may be  pangs  of\r\n\r\nconscience, a sense of guilt.  But once embarked on this course,\r\n\r\nwith  constant repetition, you get more and more brazen  on  the\r\n\r\nattack and in the scope of the attack.   All you have to do  is\r\n\r\nto dissolve organisations and societies and banish or detain the\r\n\r\nkey  political  workers in these societies.   Then  miraculously\r\n\r\neverything is tranquil on the surface.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just interpose, here comes the most operative part of\r\n\r\nthis speech:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Then an intimidated Press and the Government controlled radio\r\n\r\ntogether  can  regularly  sing  your  praises,  and  slowly  and\r\n\r\nsteadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have\r\n\r\nalready  been done.  Or if these things are referred  to  again,\r\n\r\nthey  are  conveniently distorted, and distorted with  impunity,\r\n\r\nbecause there will be no opposition to contradict.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these must seem very familiar to us in Singapore today. But\r\n\r\nthat  was in 1956 the now Senior Minister holding forth  in  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we were part of Malaysia, what did he have to say?\r\n\r\nSpeaking in the Malaysian Parliament in December 1964, he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Let us get down to fundamentals. Is this an open or a closed\r\n\r\nsociety?   Is  it  a society where man can preach  ideas  -  the\r\n\r\nnovel,   unorthodox,   heresies,   established   churches    and\r\n\r\nestablished  governments where there is a  constant contest  for\r\n\r\nmen's hearts and minds on the basis of what is right, of what is\r\n\r\njust,  or  what is in the national interest?  Or is it a  closed\r\n\r\nsociety  where  the  mass  media  -  the  newspapers,  journals,\r\n\r\npublications, TV, radio - either by sound or by sight,  or  both\r\n\r\nsound  and  sight,  feed men's minds with a  constant  drone  of\r\n\r\nsycophantic support for a particular orthodox philosophy?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the principles that the west was\r\n\r\nespousing  were  very dear to the heart of the  Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was  fighting for the same.  May  I  then  remind  the\r\n\r\nMembers  that this is not just western heresy or western  values\r\n\r\nthat I am attempting to impose on Singapore.  My commitment  and\r\n\r\nmy  belief  is  that  we in Singapore, if we  are  to  become  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic society, have to hold fast to the principles that the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister was espousing in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfifties  and sixties.  If they were found necessary  then,  they\r\n\r\nare  all the more necessary today, as we now prepare to go  into\r\n\r\nthe  21st century, with its challenges facing us, with  all  the\r\n\r\ncompetitions that confront us when we go into the 21st  century.\r\n\r\nSo,  it is not just western or liberal values but values that  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of Asian societies have accepted and which to  my  mind,\r\n\r\nand  I am sure to people who think rightly, are essential for  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now look at the position in Singapore today. We\r\n\r\nwould  appear to have reached, what the Senior Minister said  in\r\n\r\n1956,  an  intimidated  press  of  which  he  was  warning   the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly and that position, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  say,  with  regret, has been reached systematically  and\r\n\r\ndeliberately by measures taken by his Government after  it  took\r\n\r\npower in 1959.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, we have really one newspaper, or one company,\r\n\r\none  stable,  which brings out broadsheets or tabloids  but  all\r\n\r\nreporting  faithfully whatever the Government or the PAP  wishes\r\n\r\nthem to put forward.  They have failed in their duty of being  a\r\n\r\nvoice  for  the  people and they have become  a  voice  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and that has been made possible by the amendment that\r\n\r\nwas  passed in 1974 which legalised the de facto control of  the\r\n\r\npress  which  was  already in place before 1974.   Members  will\r\n\r\nrecall  that it was before 1974, the years preceding that,  that\r\n\r\nthe  Eastern  Sun  was closed.  It was accused  of  being  anti-Singapore  because  there was some money received  from  abroad.\r\n\r\nThen  there  was the forced closure of the Singapore Herald  for\r\n\r\nwhat  the Government termed \"black operations\".  No paper  which\r\n\r\nwas  even  mildly  critical  of the Government  was  allowed  to\r\n\r\noperate.   But  this was all done, as I said, de facto,  without\r\n\r\nthe  legal  control over it.  And so it was in 1974 that  a  new\r\n\r\nBill  was  introduced in Parliament, the Newspaper and  Printing\r\n\r\nPresses Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have taken the trouble to read\r\n\r\nthe debate in the Parliament on the Second Reading of that Bill.\r\n\r\nI  am  not going to bore Members by reading what was said.   But\r\n\r\nthe reason\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngiven for the amendments, and I shall take the House through the\r\n\r\namendments  that  were  made,  was  that  the  control  of   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  had to be put into the hands of Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nOne  Member  talked  about not allowing  demons  and  devils  to\r\n\r\ncontrol  the  press  in  Singapore and so subvert  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nAnother talked about even embassies and diplomatic organisations\r\n\r\nin    Singapore   subverting   Singaporeans   by   taking    out\r\n\r\nadvertisements  or airing their views through the  local  media.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, before the 1972 elections, the Opposition parties\r\n\r\nand,  particularly, the Workers' Party was accused  of  being  a\r\n\r\nproxy  for  foreign  powers and it was also mentioned  that  the\r\n\r\npress might be taken over by proxy by foreign powers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the irony of all this is that, in this House, whilst Members\r\n\r\nwho  spoke  were  all speaking about the necessity  to  put  the\r\n\r\ncontrol  over the newspapers in the hands of Singapore citizens,\r\n\r\nthey  failed  to  see that what the Act did, and  there  was  no\r\n\r\nquestion  about this, was not to put the control into the  hands\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans; it was to put the control of the newspapers in\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the Government, which are two different  things.\r\n\r\nThe  then  Minister for Culture spoke of putting the control  of\r\n\r\nour   newspapers  in  the  hands  of  our  citizens   and   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  could not afford to have black operations  mounted\r\n\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if one looks at the provisions in that Act, it is so clear\r\n\r\nthat  what  that  Act did was to put the dissemination  of  news\r\n\r\ncompletely  and  totally in the control of the  Government.   It\r\n\r\nintroduced for the first time management shares as distinct from\r\n\r\nordinary  shares,  creating  two  classes  of  shares,   namely,\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares  and ordinary shares.  No  management  shares\r\n\r\ncould be issued or transferred except to citizens of Singapore - one  may not have quarrel with that, but this is where the sting\r\n\r\nis  - or corporations who or which have been granted the written\r\n\r\napproval  of the Minister.  No company shall refuse to issue  or\r\n\r\naccept  transfer  of management shares where  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\ngranted  an  approval.   And  the holder  of  management  shares\r\n\r\nwielded great power.  These were the people who were approved by\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister.  The holder of management shares, Mr Deputy Speaker, I\r\n\r\nam  sure  Members are aware of this but I need to  emphasise  it\r\n\r\nagain, was given 200 votes for each management share held by him\r\n\r\nor  her  in  any  resolution  relating  to  the  appointment  or\r\n\r\ndismissal  of  a  director  or any member  of  the  staff  of  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper  company.  That, Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  sealed  the\r\n\r\nquestion as to who was to have the major say or the only say  in\r\n\r\nthe   appointment  of  the  editor,  the  appointment  of   even\r\n\r\njournalists and reporters in any newspaper.  It was the  holders\r\n\r\nof  the management shares and their share counted for 200  votes\r\n\r\nagainst the ordinary shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst the Act did not make any mention about the limit of\r\n\r\nshares  that may be held by management shareholders, it  limited\r\n\r\nordinary shareholders to no more than 3% of the ordinary shares.\r\n\r\nSo  through  these amendments that were made, the  press  passed\r\n\r\ninto  the  control  of  the Government legally,  de  jure,  when\r\n\r\npreviously control was effected de facto.  So what is the result\r\n\r\ntoday as a result of the amendments made in 1974 and the actions\r\n\r\ntaken under that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Singapore Press Holdings controlling the entire\r\n\r\nnewspaper  industry in Singapore.  It has been, I think,  termed\r\n\r\nthe largest press company in the world.  Who is on the board  of\r\n\r\nthis?   The  Chairman is an ex-Cabinet Minister.  The  Executive\r\n\r\nDirector  was  a  one  time Director of  the  Internal  Security\r\n\r\nDepartment.   The  other  members of the  board  are  tried  and\r\n\r\ntrusted  men  of  the  Government.  And so the  press  became  a\r\n\r\nmouthpiece for the Government.  Whatever freedom it had, and  it\r\n\r\nhad  very  little before 1974, was taken away and  it  became  a\r\n\r\ncastrated press.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I just read to you what was given to me, and it appeared on\r\n\r\nthe  Internet at the beginning of this year, I am told, and this\r\n\r\nillustrates  the control that is exercised over  publication  of\r\n\r\nany  news in the Straits Times.  This man was, he says, a junior\r\n\r\nsub-editor  in  the Straits Times, and he speaks of  an  evening\r\n\r\nwhen  he was with his Chief Sub-editor when Mr Leslie Fong,  who\r\n\r\nhas admitted that he was an ardent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadmirer  of  the PAP from his school days, came  into  the  room\r\n\r\nwhere they were working, trying to put the paper to bed, getting\r\n\r\neverything  ready,  to tell them that he had  had  a  call  from\r\n\r\nupstairs.   Everyone  understood  what  \"upstairs\"  meant.   The\r\n\r\nStraits  Times was not to overplay or underplay the visit  of  a\r\n\r\nChina  delegation that was visiting Singapore or  was  about  to\r\n\r\nvisit Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, are you prepared\r\n\r\nto substantiate what happened?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, I am saying that it appeared on the\r\n\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> No, I will not allow that. Anybody can\r\n\r\npost anything on the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Well, perhaps one could ask Mr Leslie Fong\r\n\r\nand  the Chief Sub-Editor.  He gives the name, Roger Yew.  These\r\n\r\nnames  are  mentioned.  This has not been rebutted.   There  has\r\n\r\nbeen no reply from Leslie Fong or anyone else.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Never mind about that. Unless you are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  substantiate what happened actually,  I  will  not\r\n\r\nallow you to quote that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir. But as\r\n\r\nI  said,  this  appeared in public.  It was read by Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand there has been no rebuttal of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will you proceed to a new point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> All right. May I then move on to the\r\n\r\ncomments  made about the press today in Singapore and  that,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, was also reported in the Straits Times - I hope you  are\r\n\r\nnot going to ask me to substantiate it.  These were the comments\r\n\r\nmade  by  Mr  Marshall  who  was once  the  Chief  Minister  and\r\n\r\nAmbassador for the Government in France for many years.  And  he\r\n\r\nwas  speaking at the Substation one evening.  This was  reported\r\n\r\nand  this  is what he had to say, \"Today, Singapore's censorship\r\n\r\nis worse,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbroader and more strict than any time under the British imperial\r\n\r\nrule.\"   There  is  this man, Mr Marshall,  who  was  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Singapore  and  who  was  an  Ambassador  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  saying  this publicly.  He,  of  course,  had  very\r\n\r\nunkind words for the Straits Times, calling them \"boot-lickers\".\r\n\r\nBut  he  asked  this question:  \"where do we go to  express  our\r\n\r\ndifferences  or views if we are not allowed to hold meetings  or\r\n\r\nwrite  to the press?\"  He was commenting on the refusal  of  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  to publish a letter that he had sent  protesting\r\n\r\nagainst  the death penalty and asking the President  to  commute\r\n\r\nall the death sentences to 20 year jail terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Francis Seow, in his latest book, \"Media Enthralled\",\r\n\r\nrecalls a statement made by the roving Ambassador for Singapore,\r\n\r\nProfessor  Tommy  Koh in 1991.  Speaking at a  forum,  Professor\r\n\r\nTommy  Koh  was  reported  to  have  said  that  journalists  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  must constantly work under a cloud of  fear  and,  of\r\n\r\ncourse  Members will recall that some months ago, I was  talking\r\n\r\nabout  the fear that grips Singaporeans asking for steps  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  rid  them  of  the fear.  That  is  the  position  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today.  The press has ceased to play its  role.   The\r\n\r\npress  has  become  nothing but an organ or propaganda  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and a mouthpiece for Government's views.  How long is\r\n\r\nthis  going  to  go  on if Singapore is to become  a  democratic\r\n\r\nsociety?   Is  this  the  press, Mr Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore needs for the 21st century?  Is this how we are  going\r\n\r\nto  educate our people?  Is this how we are going to equip  them\r\n\r\nfor the problems of the country that lie ahead by depriving them\r\n\r\nof  the right to know, of being informed honestly and truthfully\r\n\r\nwhat happens in Singapore?  This, I can substantiate to you,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker.   I  can tell you that several  of  my  Party's\r\n\r\nstatements,  several of my letters that I send  to  the  Straits\r\n\r\nTimes never see the light of day.  The Government makes much  of\r\n\r\nits  right  to reply.  It insists on this in foreign newspapers.\r\n\r\nBut  this  same right of which the Government makes so  much  is\r\n\r\ndenied to opposition parties or to the citizens by the press  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not rosy eyed about the press in the West. I am not\r\n\r\nunmindful  of the excesses and the lengths that the press  carry\r\n\r\ntheir freedom to.  But may I say that these excesses, especially\r\n\r\non  this recent Clinton affair in the United States, the  extent\r\n\r\nto  which  the press reported it, the extent to which the  media\r\n\r\ncarried  the news, show the strength of democracy in the  United\r\n\r\nStates.  It shows the resilience of the people.  May I say  that\r\n\r\nit is preferable, even with these excesses, to the press that we\r\n\r\nhave  in Singapore which is completely one-sided, and acts  only\r\n\r\nas  a  mouthpiece for the Government, carrying out, - performing\r\n\r\nthe  task against which Mr Lee Kuan Yew was railing in 1950s and\r\n\r\n1960s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this 1974 Bill, there was some mention of the Government\r\n\r\nhaving  thought about a Press Council.  I do not know  why  they\r\n\r\nhave  not  been able to set up a Press Council all these  years.\r\n\r\nBut,  of  course, a Press Council will be of no value if  it  is\r\n\r\nmanned by people who think alike with the PAP or the Government.\r\n\r\nThe  Council  has to be independent who values the  independence\r\n\r\nand freedom of the newspapers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I make a plea in this House, to this Government, that it is\r\n\r\ntime  that  we made a complete break with the way that  we  have\r\n\r\nbeen  controlling  our  newspapers, and give  our  people  their\r\n\r\nright,  the  unfettered, untrammelled right,  to  express  their\r\n\r\nopinions,  their  viewpoints  through  a  press  which  will  be\r\n\r\nfearless and will speak up for the people.  This is not possible\r\n\r\nat the moment with the set-up in Singapore as it is now and that\r\n\r\nis  why  I ask the Government to say in this House this  evening\r\n\r\nthat  it will be ready or happy to consider an application by  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper   company   not   controlled   by   foreigners,    but\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, to publish another newspaper outside the Singapore\r\n\r\nPress Holdings and to assure whoever is prepared to do this that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no day-to-day control over them.  That they would\r\n\r\nbe  at  liberty,  they would have the freedom to  perform  their\r\n\r\nduties  and responsibilities as a press to act as the  voice  of\r\n\r\nthe  people, to uphold the freedom of the people, and to be  the\r\n\r\nguardians of the liberty of the people.  This cannot be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nperformed  by the Straits Times, particularly, or by  any  other\r\n\r\npaper in the stable of the Singapore Press Holdings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is that those who work for these companies, for the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Press  Holdings, and who write for  these  newspapers\r\n\r\nhave been dyed in the wool with the PAP's philosophy of the role\r\n\r\nof the newspapers, which is to act simply as the disseminator of\r\n\r\nGovernment's views and Government's viewpoints and  to  try  and\r\n\r\npersuade  the people to accept the Government's policies.   That\r\n\r\nis not the role of the newspapers.  That is why I cannot see any\r\n\r\none  in the present set-up being able to discharge this new role\r\n\r\nfor the press in Singapore.  It may be that we may have to bring\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad editors who are committed to the value  of  a  free\r\n\r\npress  in a democratic society and who are prepared to speak  up\r\n\r\nwithout fear and with honesty and truth.  We may have to recruit\r\n\r\njournalists, reporters who still hold on to these values and who\r\n\r\nhave  not  surrendered these values to the requirements  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment or its preferences.  It seems to me that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of pressing urgency if, as I said earlier, we are  going\r\n\r\ninto the 21st century with our heads held high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I finally end with a prayer by a great Indian poet,\r\n\r\nRabindranath Tagore:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where knowledge is free;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow\r\n\r\ndomestic walls;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where words come out from the depth of truth;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the\r\n\r\ndreary desert sand of dead habit;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever widening\r\n\r\nthought and action;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that is my prayer for Singapore, that our people may\r\n\r\nbe  led  into that heaven of freedom where they can  hold  their\r\n\r\nheads  high  and where they can make judgments for  the  country\r\n\r\nthemselves.  And that is not possible, Mr\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, when we have a press which is manacled  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  is not able to perform its functions.   I  hope\r\n\r\nvery  much that whoever speaks on behalf of the Government  will\r\n\r\nthis  evening tell us whether the Government is ready  to  break\r\n\r\nfrom  this  habit  of 30 years or 40 years and  to  make  a  new\r\n\r\nbeginning in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto oppose the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, essentially, the motion is flawed for a number of\r\n\r\nreasons.   To  begin  with, I would like to stress  that  whilst\r\n\r\nthere  exist certain regulatory controls on the print  media  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  there is no prohibition for any company  independent\r\n\r\nof  the  Singapore Press Holdings to apply for a licence and  to\r\n\r\npublish  an alternative newspaper in Singapore if they meet  the\r\n\r\nconditions stated in the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act.  We\r\n\r\ndo  not have to go too far back in our short history to remember\r\n\r\nthat  there had existed a number of alternative newspapers here,\r\n\r\nnot  run under the ambit of the Singapore Press Holdings,  right\r\n\r\nup   to   the   1980s.   And  through  natural   attrition   and\r\n\r\nconsolidation  in  the  newspaper  industry,  the  industry  has\r\n\r\nevolved to what it is today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that the Government does not dictate nor does it\r\n\r\nhave  any direct influence on the media and the newspapers here.\r\n\r\nWhat  minimalist control the Government has over licensing,  for\r\n\r\ninstance,  is  necessary  to  safeguard  against  the  potential\r\n\r\nrampant distortion of facts that may permeate and undermine  the\r\n\r\nfragile social fabric of our society.  Issues like religious and\r\n\r\nethnic harmony have to be dealt with very carefully in order  to\r\n\r\navoid  the  conflicts evident in a close neighbour of ours  like\r\n\r\nIndonesia  where the mass proliferation of news  and  the  print\r\n\r\nmedia following the change in the President last year has simply\r\n\r\nled  to more confusion than illumination of the truth.  And this\r\n\r\nhas  contributed in part to much civil disharmony, religious and\r\n\r\nracial conflicts today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in Singapore, we cannot afford to take such risks.\r\n\r\nHence,  we  require  newspapers and  other  print  media  to  be\r\n\r\nlicensed.   This  does not, however, prevent  anyone  else  from\r\n\r\npublishing  another newspaper here, provided they are  conscious\r\n\r\nof their social responsibilities.  A free press is not an end in\r\n\r\nitself,   and   journalists  here  are  fully   aware   of   the\r\n\r\nresponsibilities that come with this freedom.  In order to  stay\r\n\r\nrelevant and respected, our local press has thus far acted in  a\r\n\r\nmost   responsible  manner  in  reporting  the  facts   as   our\r\n\r\njournalists are all fully aware of the additional role they play\r\n\r\nin nation building, and they are not under Government control or\r\n\r\npressure, as implied by the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are already many alternative means to convey\r\n\r\ninformation  in  this age where technology has enabled,  through\r\n\r\nthe Internet, for instance, almost instantaneous transmission of\r\n\r\nnews.  Currently, quite contrary to what Mr Jeyaretnam has said,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  the  freedom to access  the  Internet,  have\r\n\r\naccess  to  cable TV and have access to foreign  newspapers  and\r\n\r\nmagazines,  to obtain, to compare and to analyse information  in\r\n\r\norder  to  make  rational informed choices.   Our  track  record\r\n\r\nunderlines the openness of our news media.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the problem today is not whether we should have another\r\n\r\nnewspaper.   The  problem  is that Singaporeans  have  too  many\r\n\r\nchoices  to  choose now, too many choices to access  information\r\n\r\nand  news,  given  the limited free time that  they  have  after\r\n\r\nminusing  hours  for working, sleeping, resting and  recreation.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  increasingly more and more selective  in  the\r\n\r\nnews that they read.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the existence of a vibrant and active media hub in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  evident that the assumptions of  Mr  Jeyaretnam's\r\n\r\nmotion  cannot be true.  Singapore has successfully  transformed\r\n\r\nitself  today into a regional media hub where CNBC,  ESPN,  MTV,\r\n\r\nDiscovery channel and many other international broadcasters have\r\n\r\nset  up  bases  here.   Access to information  will  be  further\r\n\r\nenhanced when Singapore One and CableVision are transmitted live\r\n\r\ninto the majority of homes in Singapore by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nend  of  this  year.  These organisations are most sensitive  to\r\n\r\nGovernment  controls and they will not thrive in  a  closed  and\r\n\r\ncontrolled society.  If this happens, they will be the first  to\r\n\r\nflee from it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been pointed out, I think this motion is\r\n\r\nnonsensical.  There is no need for such a motion as there is  no\r\n\r\nspecification by the Government that newspapers are only allowed\r\n\r\nto  be  printed by Singapore Press Holdings.  Indeed, under  the\r\n\r\nNewspaper and Printing Presses Act, which Mr Jeyaretnam has just\r\n\r\ndescribed,  anyone can set up a newspaper company in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nprovided  they meet the shareholding criteria.  They  must  have\r\n\r\ntwo  classes  of  shares, management and  ordinary  shares,  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares  have to be in the hands of  Singaporeans  or\r\n\r\norganizations  approved  by  the  Government.   Any  shareholder\r\n\r\ncannot  hold  more   than  3%  of  the  shares.   An  additional\r\n\r\ncriterion  is that the directors of this newspaper company  must\r\n\r\nall  be  Singaporeans.  If indeed Mr Jeyaretnam can find  enough\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to meet these criteria, he can set up a newspaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been involved in the print media for many years and\r\n\r\nI  believe that the print media has consolidated throughout  the\r\n\r\nyears  due to pure economic fundamentals.  With a population  of\r\n\r\nonly  three  million people and about 700,000-800,000 households\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and for reasons of economies of scale,  it  makes\r\n\r\nmore business sense for consolidation of the newspaper industry,\r\n\r\nas  there  is  not enough advertising revenue or  readership  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to make it viable for an alternative newspaper company\r\n\r\nto   survive  financially  on  its  own.   There  is   currently\r\n\r\nsufficient  competition  already as  we  can  access  the  major\r\n\r\nnewspapers and publications from all over the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would suggest to Mr Jeyaretnam that it is\r\n\r\nsimply  a  matter of financial economics that  has  led  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  status  quo  and not, as he has implied,  a  result  of\r\n\r\nGovernment controls and pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge the House to reject the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, for giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion calls for the Government to give an assurance\r\n\r\nabout  granting a newspaper licence to any company applying  for\r\n\r\none.   I  believe,  like  Mr Chew, this is  not  necessary.   My\r\n\r\nunderstanding is that there have been no applications in  recent\r\n\r\nyears for any newspaper licence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time an application was made was in April 1988 when the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times Press Ltd applied for and was issued a permit  to\r\n\r\npublish  the  New  Paper.  The difficulty in sustaining  another\r\n\r\ndaily   publication  as  a  viable  business  is   perhaps   the\r\n\r\ndisincentive  against another daily newspaper being  established\r\n\r\nand  not  because  the Government is not willing  to  grant  the\r\n\r\nlicence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asian cities do not find it easy to support two English language\r\n\r\ndaily  papers.   The  No. 2 daily newspaper is  only  marginally\r\n\r\nprofitable.   Examples are the Nation in Bangkok  and  the  Hong\r\n\r\nKong Standard.   And even the renowned Asian Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\nlost money for over 10 years before it made any profit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if a bona fide application to start a newspaper was made and\r\n\r\ndenied,  then  perhaps Mr Jeyaretnam should ask  for  a  reason.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we  cannot expect the Government to give  assurances\r\n\r\nfor  theoretical issues.  There will be no end to the number and\r\n\r\ntypes of assurances which it will be asked to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I do believe in competition - between\r\n\r\ncompanies,   and  certainly  between  newspapers.    Competition\r\n\r\nalready  exists for the private sector, and is being  introduced\r\n\r\nfor  state-owned monopolies.  GLCs which had natural  or  quasi-monopolies are also being encouraged to face competition.  In so\r\n\r\nfar  as  SPH  is a GLC, I believe it is healthy for it  to  face\r\n\r\ncompetition, particularly since it has pretty much cornered  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  business  in  Singapore.   As  a  consumer,  I  would\r\n\r\ncertainly welcome a competitor to start another daily, but  this\r\n\r\nis not for us in this House nor the Government to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmandate.   I would only hope that if a serious-minded competitor\r\n\r\nwishes  to challenge the Straits Times, the Government will  not\r\n\r\nstand in the way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for business competition. I believe that there is\r\n\r\nanother   issue  here  which  should  be  addressed,   ie,   the\r\n\r\ncompetition  for  ideas.  Learning to evaluate  competing  ideas\r\n\r\nhelps  to  nurture  in  our  young the attributes  of  critical,\r\n\r\nindependent and analytical thinking which will be the basis  for\r\n\r\na  knowledge-based  economy.  If we truly wish  to  be  an  open\r\n\r\nsociety,  capable  of  making sound  judgments  by  assessing  a\r\n\r\nsituation  from different angles and discerning the  substantive\r\n\r\nfrom  the  fluff,  then we must encourage an  environment  which\r\n\r\nenables a competition for ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I would encourage a competitor to the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes.   I  must quickly add here that judging from the increase\r\n\r\nof  letters to the Editor over the past few years, Straits Times\r\n\r\nhad  indeed published many \"alternative\" views from Singaporeans\r\n\r\non  a  whole  range  of Government policies.  There  were  angry\r\n\r\nprotests  and clear rebuttals to public policies; the  Chinatown\r\n\r\ntheme destination was one recent example.  I applaud the Straits\r\n\r\nTimes  for printing the comments from the critics and the public\r\n\r\nfor  undertaking the initiative to write in and make their views\r\n\r\nknown.   For  me,  such  effort reflects a  growing  independent\r\n\r\nthinking  among  Singaporeans who  want  more  say  in  national\r\n\r\npolicies.   And I urge all newspapers to continue to  give  more\r\n\r\nspace to Singaporeans to capture their different opinion pieces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I do not support the motion because it is framed\r\n\r\nwithin  unclear terms of reference and postulates a  theoretical\r\n\r\nsituation  which has not occurred.  But I do wish  that  a  bona\r\n\r\nfide  newspaper  company  will  step  forward  to  take  up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge to compete with SPH.  I hope the Government will grant\r\n\r\nit  a  licence  to  operate as a business; then  we  should  let\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, as intelligent readers, decide if it  can  survive\r\n\r\nand flourish.  If this happens, Singaporeans will be all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter  prepared in the new millennium to benefit  from,  rather\r\n\r\nthan be overwhelmed by, the intense competition of ideas arising\r\n\r\nfrom the information explosion from the Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I give my qualified support to the motion that  we\r\n\r\nshould  be  ready  to  grant a licence to  a  newspaper  company\r\n\r\noutside  the  Singapore Press Holdings and suggest reducing  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  laws  for management shares and special holding  rights\r\n\r\nunder  the  Newspaper  and  Printing Presses  Act.   However,  I\r\n\r\ndisagree  with some of the proposals made by Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam.\r\n\r\nI am personally in favour of certain controls.  I cannot support\r\n\r\nthe  motion  that  no government control be  extended  over  the\r\n\r\npublication  of  news.  We should maintain the present  controls\r\n\r\nagainst   foreign   ownership  and   control   of   local   news\r\n\r\norganisations.  Even in the US, while there is no ban on foreign\r\n\r\nownership of newspaper or cable system, a foreign entity may not\r\n\r\ncontrol  a  radio  or television outlet.  While  an  unregulated\r\n\r\npress  is very much a feature of the media in the US, the  Voice\r\n\r\nof  America  is still government-owned or controlled  which,  by\r\n\r\nlaw,  is  not  allowed to broadcast within the  borders  of  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it would be better to be more protectionistic\r\n\r\nand  not allow a completely unregulated press because foreigners\r\n\r\nmay not understand our unique nation building process, making it\r\n\r\neasy for media to tear society apart.  They may not be aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  state  of our democratic and political culture which  means\r\n\r\nthat a completely free exchange in public can lead to extremism.\r\n\r\nThe  vulnerability of our small nation still needs a coordinated\r\n\r\nnational effort by the Government.  I also accept the view  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  can  and should bring  its  influence  on  news\r\n\r\norganisation.   The  Government has a mandate  to  set  a  broad\r\n\r\nagenda.   It  is right for it to want the media to  support  the\r\n\r\nagenda and do what it  can to persuade editors that it is right.\r\n\r\nGovernment  intervention of the press can also be  justified  in\r\n\r\nterms  of the influence to ensure that the Straits Times, Lianhe\r\n\r\nZaobao, Tamil\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMurasu,  Berita Harian play a broad-based national role and  not\r\n\r\nsuccumb to ethnic and communal roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I support the proposal raised by the NCMP\r\n\r\nto  allow the establishment of another newspaper company outside\r\n\r\nthe  SPH  and  urge the Government to review the  Newspaper  and\r\n\r\nPrinting  Presses Act, which currently allows the Government  to\r\n\r\nappoint  management  shareholders of Singapore  Press  Holdings.\r\n\r\nThis has brought about an undesirable consequence that the Board\r\n\r\nof Directors and, through them, the editors who are appointed by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  being generally perceived  as  biased  or  pro-Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: when does Government influence become\r\n\r\nGovernment censorship?  The danger of Government having too much\r\n\r\npower  over  the  press  is, instead  of  winning  arguments  by\r\n\r\npersuading editors, which settles its case by force,  the  media\r\n\r\nmust fall in line.  This is not only unfair to the press and  to\r\n\r\nthe  public,  it  is also wrong because it can  make  Government\r\n\r\nlazy.   It  removes an important check in policy discussion  and\r\n\r\ndebate.   After a while, Government officials may  believe  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  always  winning all the arguments  because  they  are\r\n\r\nalways  right  and forget that the real reason  is  because  the\r\n\r\npress   is   not  allowed  to  counter  argue  too  strenuously.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  press reform may be necessary to check  against  the\r\n\r\npossible abuse of power by future governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The usual justification for media laws is the need to be\r\n\r\ncareful  with  racial,  religious  and  regional  sensitivities.\r\n\r\nToday, most media professionals in Singapore have by now already\r\n\r\ninternalised  the  sensitivities.   If  controls   were   lifted\r\n\r\ntomorrow, I doubt that they will go and start a riot.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chairman of the feedback group on mass media, I\r\n\r\nfrequently   receive  feedback  that  we  should  have   another\r\n\r\nnewspaper outside the SPH.  But Singaporeans are still generally\r\n\r\nconcerned  about  the negative repercussions  of  extremism  and\r\n\r\nchauvinism.   In this regard, I support the existing  laws  that\r\n\r\nlimit what can and cannot be printed or broadcast in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This will ensure that a racially chauvinistic  press\r\n\r\nwill  not emerge.  Furthermore, there are provisions within  the\r\n\r\nlegal framework to handle undesirable or subversive press.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the  Sedition  Act  which  prohibits  publication   or\r\n\r\nspeeches  that  exhibit  seditious tendencies,  the  Undesirable\r\n\r\nPublications  Act which can ban publication contrary  to  public\r\n\r\ninterest,  and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act which  can\r\n\r\nrestrict  the circulation of any publication sold in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThese   provide   adequate   safeguards   against   chauvinistic\r\n\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, Sir, what the reader wants is an independent\r\n\r\npress or, on the other, the Government may want a press that  is\r\n\r\nfully accountable to the state. This appears to be fundamentally\r\n\r\nirreconcilable.  But my contention is that it is not necessarily\r\n\r\nmutual  or  exclusive as it may first appear.  What is generally\r\n\r\nmisunderstood  is  the  role  journalists  play  in  maintaining\r\n\r\nindependence in ethical principles in respecting the conduct  of\r\n\r\nthe press.  This means recognition of the importance of fair and\r\n\r\nbalanced reporting in which opinions that differ from the writer\r\n\r\nor  the  newspaper or the Government officials are  nevertheless\r\n\r\naccurately   portrayed.   It  means   to   be   disciplined   in\r\n\r\ndeliberately  separating one's own opinion  from  the  objective\r\n\r\npresentation of facts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's view, I think journalists\r\n\r\nin  Singapore have placed a high level of importance  on  public\r\n\r\nservice,  impartial  reporting and balanced  opinion.   But  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  ask itself, even if the original  reasons  for\r\n\r\nmedia  controls have to do with national security, is  this  the\r\n\r\nway  media  controls are actually applied today?  There  is  the\r\n\r\ndanger that the present situation may in the future lead to  the\r\n\r\npress  being  managed to make Government officials'  job  easier\r\n\r\nbecause  decisions can be made with a minimum of fuss or debate.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, then it is time to review our media regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise a number of issues, hopefully, to\r\n\r\npersuade the Government to review the present laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The concern that the local market is not big enough for\r\n\r\na  second or third newspaper company to survive.  I think it  is\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate for a private enterprise to decide and  should\r\n\r\nbe left to market forces.  Readers as citizens and consumers can\r\n\r\ndecide  for  themselves the newspaper that is  worthy  of  their\r\n\r\ntrust and patronage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Competition can bring about not only diversity of views but\r\n\r\ngenerate creativity and efficiency in management and operations.\r\n\r\nAs  the  bulk  of revenues from newspaper companies  comes  from\r\n\r\nadvertising, increased competition is more likely to bring about\r\n\r\nmore benefits to consumers.  We must be aware of the dangers  of\r\n\r\nmonopolies as they are seldom efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The belief that ideas must be able to conflict with one\r\n\r\nanother and given a chance to be heard because participation and\r\n\r\ndisagreement  in shaping public policy is an important  part  of\r\n\r\nour nation building process and, certainly, an important concept\r\n\r\nof  publication, otherwise newspapers will not be able to fulfil\r\n\r\nadequately their role as mirror of society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There is also the fear that competition may lead to an\r\n\r\nadversarial  press  and  Government  relationship,  as  in  some\r\n\r\nforeign  examples,  leading to being a watchdog  of  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  press  is  constantly  on  the  lookout  for  mistakes   of\r\n\r\nGovernment.   But  we  must view debate quite  differently  from\r\n\r\nadversarial arguments, debate as a necessary value in the search\r\n\r\nfor  a  solution  to common problems.  It presupposes  that  the\r\n\r\ndebaters are worried by the same questions.  It brings new  life\r\n\r\nand ideas and facts and makes possible a  better solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) While the press in Singapore is generally credited for a\r\n\r\nreliable  and accurate source of information, it suffers,  quite\r\n\r\nunfairly, some credibility problems when it comes to coverage of\r\n\r\nlocal domestic issues.  Readers have learnt to read between  the\r\n\r\nlines.   Unfortunately,  bad  news about  opposition  are  often\r\n\r\nregarded as politically motivated even when they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare not.   Having an alternative or independent newspaper can do\r\n\r\nmuch to remove this credibility gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press reforms can also lead to a more vibrant community-based\r\n\r\nnewspaper,  something which I believe is  much  needed  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  part of our effort to forge a stronger  community\r\n\r\nspirit  amongst  neighbours.  This  is  especially  relevant  in\r\n\r\nSingapore as housing redevelopment has uprooted families to  new\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods.   A community-based newspaper is  able  to  make\r\n\r\npeople  aware  of  their surroundings and the changes  that  are\r\n\r\ntaking  place.   They can do things that national newspapers  do\r\n\r\nnot.  They can help instill a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these are not sufficient to assure the Government, I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  introduce other relevant measures as  applied  in\r\n\r\nsome  other countries.  In the UK, for example, there is a Press\r\n\r\nComplaint  Commission  which is a voluntary  non-statutory  body\r\n\r\nestablished  and funded by the newspaper and magazine  industry,\r\n\r\nwhich   considers,   adjudicates,   conciliates   and   resolves\r\n\r\ncomplaints  of unfair treatment by the press, and  ensures  that\r\n\r\nthe  press  maintains  the highest professional  standards  with\r\n\r\nrespect  for  generally recognised freedom, notably  freedom  of\r\n\r\nexpression,  the  public's right to know and the  right  of  the\r\n\r\npress to operate and free from improper pressure.  Newspaper and\r\n\r\nmagazine conduct is judged against a code of practice.  This has\r\n\r\nbeen  drafted by editors and agreed by the industry and ratified\r\n\r\nby  the  Commission.   Its  members  are  editors  of  national,\r\n\r\nregional and local newspapers and magazines and also from  other\r\n\r\nfields, including Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, libel laws and self-appointed press monitors act as\r\n\r\nchecks  and  balances against journalistic excesses both  inside\r\n\r\nand outside the industry.  Some newspapers appoint ombudsman  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  public  complaints and publish  self-criticism  and\r\n\r\nenforce internal standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While there are those in Singapore who view that the media in US\r\n\r\nis dangerously\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadversarial, very few mass circulation newspapers, magazines and\r\n\r\nbroadcast   stations  are  in  fact  affiliated  with  political\r\n\r\norganisations.  In fact, purposeful non-affiliation has been the\r\n\r\nhallmark  of  American press characterised by both  professional\r\n\r\npride   and   independence  arising  from  self  and   economics\r\n\r\nsufficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the state of our society, Sir, we can and should\r\n\r\nhave  an  independent press, though not necessarily unregulated.\r\n\r\nWe  can  have an ideological non-partisan newspaper, though  not\r\n\r\none with political affiliation.  We can have a sparkling debate,\r\n\r\nas  Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam says, though not an adversarial one.   We\r\n\r\ncan  have a paper that mirrors the diverse views of our society,\r\n\r\nyet  not with the self-appointed watchdog of Government.  If  we\r\n\r\ndo  not have it now, we should work progressively to have it  in\r\n\r\nthe  future.  But press reform must be made part and  parcel  of\r\n\r\nthis process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  first  of  all,  I must say I am very  impressed  by  your\r\n\r\npatience for listening to the very long and repetitive speech of\r\n\r\nthe NCMP which went on for one full hour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an open society, it is important that Singapore possesses a\r\n\r\nnews media which is objective, fair, pragmatic, responsible  and\r\n\r\nindependent  and  which enjoys the freedom of speech.   This  is\r\n\r\nbecause  it  will  facilitate  the mutual  transmission  of  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  signals,  the  exchange of  views  and  arguments,  and\r\n\r\ndissemination  of  latest  science  and  technology  among   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  social organisations and  the  people  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  races,  and  even  with the international  communities.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I  admire  the  important  roles  played   by   our\r\n\r\nnewspapers  such  as the Straits Times, Lianhe Zaobao,  Business\r\n\r\nTimes, Shin Min Daily News, Lianhe Wanbao, The New Paper, Berita\r\n\r\nHarian  and Tamil Murasu.   As independent and responsible  news\r\n\r\nmedia  of  Singapore,  they have spared no effort  in  promoting\r\n\r\nSingapore's development into an open and progressive society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opposition Members complain that they are not getting\r\n\r\nenough coverage in our local newspapers.  On the other hand,  my\r\n\r\nPAP colleagues often remark that the opposition members seem  to\r\n\r\nattract more attention from the local press than they do.   Even\r\n\r\nas  the Deputy Chairman of the GPC for MITA, my picture does not\r\n\r\nappear in the newspapers as much as the opposition members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe every newspaper has its own standards and guidelines,\r\n\r\nand  our  journalists certainly know their job.  We  cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat  they  do  not  have  freedom of speech  and  we  want  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  liberalise the issue of more  permits  for  more\r\n\r\nnewspapers to be published in Singapore.  I do not think this is\r\n\r\na  sensible  argument and I cannot agree with it.   I  therefore\r\n\r\noppose the motion tabled by the NCMP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, journalism is a sacred job. The\r\n\r\nbirth and growth of a newspaper is closely related to the degree\r\n\r\nof  support  it receives from its faithful readers.   Whether  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper is successful or not, it is dependent not only on  its\r\n\r\nformat and design, its sophisticated printing or its interesting\r\n\r\ncontents,  it is also on whether it is responsible, whether  its\r\n\r\narguments  are  independent and free, and on the professionalism\r\n\r\nof  its  journalists.   In addition,  and more  importantly,  it\r\n\r\nwould   also  depend  on  whether  the  inclination  and  social\r\n\r\nconsciousness  represented  or reflected  by  the  newspaper  is\r\n\r\naccepted by the people or not, and whether the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  readers  hold  the  view that this newspaper  is  credible,\r\n\r\nreliable and readable.  This is something that is decided by the\r\n\r\nmarket  situation.  It is not something that the Government  can\r\n\r\nmanipulate or influence.  If the market has a need and it  feels\r\n\r\nthat  more  newspapers  should  be  published,  I  believe   the\r\n\r\npublishers will naturally make the necessary application to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.    So  long  as  they  comply  with  the   necessary\r\n\r\nrequirement,  their  application will be approved.   This  is  a\r\n\r\nbusiness activity and conduct.  I do not think Parliament  needs\r\n\r\nto be bothered about it.   Nowadays, with all these gloomy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  downturns around us, I think it would do us  well  for\r\n\r\nParliament  to  spend  time discussing how  to  tide  over  this\r\n\r\neconomic crisis. This is the really important issue.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot waste time talking about such unimportant matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the circulation figures I have obtained, the major\r\n\r\nnewspapers  in  Singapore  have a large  readership.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  their independence, their reliability and their  freedom\r\n\r\nof speech have been supported by the readers.  This is evidenced\r\n\r\nby  the  daily circulation figures of the various newspapers  in\r\n\r\n1997.   For Straits Times the figure is 376,900; Lianhe  Zaobao,\r\n\r\n199,300;  Shin Min Daily News, 111,600; Lianhe Wanbao,  132,200;\r\n\r\nand Business Times, only 33,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to control all these newspapers, how can\r\n\r\nthe  contents  of  all these newspapers be so eventful,  with  a\r\n\r\nhundred  flowers blossom, a hundred schools of thought  contend?\r\n\r\nBesides, before the Government considers issuing the licence for\r\n\r\na  new  newspaper to be published, we should also  consider  the\r\n\r\nfuture of our journalists.  With an additional newspaper, it may\r\n\r\nhave some adverse effect on their salaries and remuneration.  If\r\n\r\nthe  circulation drops, and if the newspaper cannot  grow,  then\r\n\r\ntheir  rice bowl would be in danger.  Now that we are facing  an\r\n\r\neconomic  crisis,  we have to look after their  rice  bowl.   We\r\n\r\nshould  not use our own perception of freedom to cause  harm  to\r\n\r\nthem.   Mr Jeyaretnam's perception of freedom cannot be used  to\r\n\r\nfeed these people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have been in the publication\r\n\r\nindustry  for  more than 20 years.  There is one  motto  in  our\r\n\r\npublication  industry.  It says that if you want  to  kill  your\r\n\r\nfriend  or  your enemy, the best method is to encourage  him  to\r\n\r\ninvest  in  starting  a newspaper.  Because  in  Singapore,  the\r\n\r\nmarket  is small, our population is small, and investment  in  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper is a very heavy one.  It is not just $1 million or  $2\r\n\r\nmillion - much more than that, and the risk is high!  Every  day\r\n\r\nyou have to publish.  Yesterday's paper, even if you\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  sell  it,  you would have to print  today's  paper.  And\r\n\r\ntoday's paper, you do not know whether you can sell or not,  but\r\n\r\ntomorrow you will still have to publish.  Whether your newspaper\r\n\r\ncan  sell or not, you have to edit, you have to write, you  have\r\n\r\nto   print  every  day.   Finally,  if  you  cannot  sell   your\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  you sell them cheaply to the karang guni  man.  The\r\n\r\nnewspaper business is very, very capital-intensive.  If you want\r\n\r\nyour  friend  or  your  enemy to die,  the  best  method  is  to\r\n\r\nencourage him to start a newspaper!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that Mr Jeyaretnam could understand this motto of\r\n\r\nthe  publication industry.  Do not encourage people to  start  a\r\n\r\nnewspaper.  You will be causing much harm to them.  According to\r\n\r\nthe  motion  by  Mr  Jeyaretnam, the  most  ideal  newspaper  or\r\n\r\npublication  in  Singapore  perhaps  is  The  Hammer,  that   is\r\n\r\npublished by the Workers' Party.  The Hammer is published  under\r\n\r\nhis  control.   Whatever  he writes, it  can  be  published  and\r\n\r\nhopefully  it  will  enjoy  good circulation.   Maybe  they  are\r\n\r\nselling more than the Straits Times or the Lianhe Zaobao.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know.   I am not sure.  It is not easy.  I think  he  knows\r\n\r\nbest whether it is selling well or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, whether the newspaper comes under\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Press Holdings or under another syndicate, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  important.   The most important question  is  whether  this\r\n\r\nnewspaper  could  report  in a fair, objective  and  independent\r\n\r\nmanner.  Whether it could receive support from the readers, that\r\n\r\nis  the  most important thing! I feel that our local  newspapers\r\n\r\nhave also attained this.  In view of that, I think we should not\r\n\r\nwaste our time discussing the NCMP's motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Peh Chin Hua says the\r\n\r\nnewspaper  in  Singapore  is eventful, with  a  hundred  flowers\r\n\r\nblossom, and a hundred schools of thought contend.  But we  must\r\n\r\nnot  forget that there is actually only one newspaper, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).  Our Secretary-General  has\r\n\r\nmentioned a while ago that the Chairman of SPH was a former  PAP\r\n\r\nCabinet  Minister  and its Executive Director was  formerly  the\r\n\r\nDirector of the Internal Security Department.  He said that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore newspapers are like a hundred flowers blossom.     But\r\n\r\nin  fact,  it is only one single flower blooming.  One  solitary\r\n\r\nstalk.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh also talked about the readability and readership of a\r\n\r\nnewspaper being dependent on whether a newspaper is responsible,\r\n\r\nindependent  or not, and he used  the daily circulation  figures\r\n\r\nto  say  that  our  Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao  have  great\r\n\r\nsupport from a very large readership.  But he has forgotten,  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, our  readers have no other choices - Straits Times or\r\n\r\nLianhe  Zaobao.  If you want to read the newspapers,  these  are\r\n\r\nthe  only  newspapers you can get!  So if you are talking  about\r\n\r\ncirculation figures and say, well, they are supported by a large\r\n\r\nfollowing of  readers, and you say they are independent, I think\r\n\r\nthere is no logic to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if we are talking about the present\r\n\r\nsituation  of  newspapers  in  Singapore  and  claim  that   our\r\n\r\npopulation  now  is too small to support more  newspapers  here,\r\n\r\nthen  let  us  not  forget that long before our  population  has\r\n\r\nattained  the  present state, we had at least two major  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  the  Sin Chew Jit Poh and the  Nanyang  Siang  Pau.\r\n\r\nLater on, we had Shin Min  which was originally independent, but\r\n\r\neventually it also became part of the Singapore Press  Holdings.\r\n\r\nI  do  not know whether this merger was due to  economic reasons\r\n\r\nor  because  of some political pressure causing them  to  merge.\r\n\r\nHowever,   what is very apparent to us is, as what  Mr  Peh  has\r\n\r\nsaid  just now, it is a question of rice bowl.  How much control\r\n\r\nthere  is  on the newspaper, I would not be able to  say.   Only\r\n\r\nthose  who are working in the newspaper company will know.   But\r\n\r\nvery  obviously  under  our Newspaper and Printing  Presses  Act\r\n\r\nthere  are certain restrictions, and the big bosses of SPH  have\r\n\r\nclose relationship with the Government.  So, if you work in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  if  your reporting causes some unhappiness  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, will it affect your rice bowl or not?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government would say, \"In the past, although it was\r\n\r\npossible  for us to do so, we have never directed the newspapers\r\n\r\nas to what they should do.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nVery often, we say, \"Well, if you know how to earn a living; you\r\n\r\nshould know what to do.  You know who your bosses are, you  know\r\n\r\nwhat  their  preferences are.\"  But, of course, I am not  saying\r\n\r\nthat  our reporters and editors are all like that.  But I  think\r\n\r\neveryone  has  his conscience.  I believe they  have  their  own\r\n\r\njudgement.    But  because  of  this  law  and  this  management\r\n\r\nstructure,  there is a certain psychological pressure  on  them.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Government may not have to direct them what to  do,\r\n\r\nthey  have  to form their own judgement.  There is an intangible\r\n\r\npressure on them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They themselves know there are certain things they cannot\r\n\r\nput  in  the newspapers. This is what they call self-censorship.\r\n\r\nThe impression given to people is that the newspaper is just the\r\n\r\nvoice  of the Government.  For different newspapers, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  Zaobao or Wanbao, reports on an event, more often  than not,\r\n\r\nwill  turn out to be carrying the same mood, the same sentiment,\r\n\r\nthe same view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if there is any company or entrepreneur who wants to start a\r\n\r\nnewspaper, I think the Government should take an open  mind  and\r\n\r\nissue  a  permit to him.  Although now with advanced technology,\r\n\r\nthere  are different media, for example, the Internet, TV, etc.,\r\n\r\nthe  newspaper is still the most popular news medium and a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  one.   Whether  it  is  independent,  whether  it  is\r\n\r\nreliable, whether its reporting is balanced, would have  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant effect on the development of the society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, Mr Peh said that the opposition parties were well\r\n\r\ncovered  in  the  newspapers.   Let  us  look  at  the  reports,\r\n\r\nparticularly those covering the General Elections - the election\r\n\r\nrallies.  This coverage is very important, because  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust  be well informed before they make their decisions and cast\r\n\r\ntheir  votes.   If  anyone is to sit down  and  do  a  thorough,\r\n\r\nobjective analysis of the coverage of all these election rallies\r\n\r\nin  the  local  newspapers,  it will be very obvious  where  the\r\n\r\nbalance  was.   At  other times, of course, the newspapers  have\r\n\r\ndifferent  emphasis  and different focus.   But  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nreaders  are very clear.  We have different views and  different\r\n\r\nperspectives\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  balance of reporting in our Singapore newspapers.   Are\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore newspapers biased?  Is their reporting  balanced?\r\n\r\nI  think  the readers know best.  This question is best answered\r\n\r\nby the general  newspaper readers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br>7.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nInformation  and  the  Arts (Encik Yatiman  Yusof):   Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I rise on behalf of the Minister to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I was in Nevada in the early 80s, being\r\n\r\ninvited  by the American Press Institute to take up a  newspaper\r\n\r\nediting course at the University of Nevada in the west coast  of\r\n\r\nUS.   The  content  of  lectures that I had  heard  during  that\r\n\r\ncourse, about 18 years ago, ring familiar with the remarks  made\r\n\r\nby the NMP today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> NCMP!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> NCMP, I am sorry. Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  Singapore is an open society and an international  trading\r\n\r\nand  financial centre.  As a financial centre, our markets  must\r\n\r\nbe  as  up  to  date as other major financial centres,  such  as\r\n\r\nLondon, New York or Tokyo.  Singapore's economy is powered by  a\r\n\r\nfree  flow of information.  In recent years, we have also become\r\n\r\na  media hub.  Today, no city in Asia has the same ready  access\r\n\r\nto  news  wires, magazines, newspapers, television channels  and\r\n\r\nthe Internet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently over 40 cable TV channels in Singapore, of\r\n\r\nwhich  more than three-quarters are foreign channels transmitted\r\n\r\n\"live\"  through the Singapore Cable Vision (SCV).  These include\r\n\r\nnews  channel like CNN, BBC and CNBC.  The BBC has a 24-hour  FM\r\n\r\nradio  service  operating  in  Singapore.   International   news\r\n\r\nagencies, such as Reuters, Bloomberg, AP, AFP and Nikkei are all\r\n\r\nrepresented in Singapore.  Singapore is also served by  numerous\r\n\r\nforeign  newspaper magazines.  The well-known  ones  among  over\r\n\r\n5,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  publications like Time, The Economist, The  Asian  Wall\r\n\r\nStreet Journal have significant circulations here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, including the Opposition, have many channels of\r\n\r\ncommunication.   No  matter how they argue  about  the  coverage\r\n\r\nduring   the  election,  Opposition  Members  can  hold   public\r\n\r\nmeetings,  publish  party  newsletters,  write  books  and  host\r\n\r\nInternet  websites.   The  fact is that Singaporeans  have  many\r\n\r\navenues for the free exchange of ideas and views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is such a diversity of news and information\r\n\r\nservices,  we  need a \"Singapore\" perspective.   The  NMPs,  Mdm\r\n\r\nChiang  and  Mr Zulkifli, may use different languages  but  both\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  there is this need for a \"Singapore\" perspective.\r\n\r\nThis   \"Singapore\"  perspective  is  important   to   hold   us,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  together.  This is nothing  new.   Every  region,\r\n\r\nevery  country  in  the  world, would like  to  have  their  own\r\n\r\nperspective.  Whether it is in the Middle East during the Middle\r\n\r\nEast  War, or even during the Falklands War, there is  need  for\r\n\r\nthe  countries in the region to establish their point  of  view,\r\n\r\ntheir  perspective  and  to convince the  world  that  there  is\r\n\r\nanother viewpoint.  And for Singapore, such perspective is  even\r\n\r\nmore crucial because Singapore is a compact city-state populated\r\n\r\nby people of different races, languages, religions and cultures.\r\n\r\nRacial  and  religious emotions can easily  be  whipped  up  and\r\n\r\npassions inflamed by irresponsible rabble rousing.  We also live\r\n\r\nin  a complicated region which requires us to manage our foreign\r\n\r\nrelations in a sensitive way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singapore has managed the information flow by not\r\n\r\nblocking it.  And we believe in it.  We would not block  it  but\r\n\r\nby stating our point of view in competition with the world view.\r\n\r\nSo  our local media understand this position and they share this\r\n\r\nposition.    Our  newspapers  have  a  \"Singapore\"  perspective,\r\n\r\nseeking to forge consensus and facilitate nation-building.  They\r\n\r\nunderstand that they best serve Singapore by accurate reporting,\r\n\r\nclear  analysis  and  intelligent  interpreting  of  events  and\r\n\r\ndevelopments through Singapore eyes for Singapore minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local press, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, has not adopted an\r\n\r\nadversarial  role  just  because  news  organisations  in   some\r\n\r\ncountries have done so.  Singapore does not subscribe to the  US\r\n\r\nmodel  of the press as a \"fourth estate\".  We have never and  we\r\n\r\nwill  never.  I am happy to note that the NMP, Mr Zulkifli  too,\r\n\r\nbelieves in a non-adversarial press.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is in the interest of Singapore to have a press that\r\n\r\nreports accurately and objectively.  The press can disagree  and\r\n\r\ndebate  on  national  policies with  the  Government,  encourage\r\n\r\npublic  dialogue  and convey divergent viewpoints.   We  do  not\r\n\r\ncontrol  the press.  We do not control what the press publishes.\r\n\r\nThey are free to publish what they want based on their editorial\r\n\r\npolicy  and  professional judgement, provided  they  uphold  and\r\n\r\nprotect  our national interests and national cohesiveness.   For\r\n\r\nour  society  to hold together, it needs institutions  and  high\r\n\r\npoints   which  citizens  look  up  to.   The  media   has   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to preserve these high points and  not  diminish\r\n\r\nthem unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public surveys have shown that the local press is well regarded\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans.  Its credibility among Singaporeans is  higher\r\n\r\nthan the credibility of the established Western newspapers among\r\n\r\ntheir own readers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP, Mr Jeyaretnam, calls upon the Government to announce\r\n\r\nits  readiness  to grant a licence to a newspaper  company.   As\r\n\r\npointed  out  by  the  NMP, Mdm Claire Chiang,  it  is  academic\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is a hypothetical question.  The party has  yet  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  a  request.   I  would like to inform  Members  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber that in March last year in this House, during the Budget\r\n\r\ndebate, the Minister for Information and the Arts stated that if\r\n\r\nthe  market  can  accommodate another  newspaper,  we  will  not\r\n\r\ndisallow  it.   Like existing newspapers, a new  newspaper  must\r\n\r\noperate within the NPPA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One requirement is that newspapers published in Singapore\r\n\r\nmust  not  come under foreign control as they must feel  a  deep\r\n\r\nsense   of  responsibility  for  Singapore.   They  must   guard\r\n\r\nSingapore's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest  when  dealing with sensitive issues such  as  defence,\r\n\r\ninternal security, race, language and religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers which circulate widely here must also give\r\n\r\nGovernment  the  right of reply, a subject which  the  NCMP  had\r\n\r\nraised earlier.  We do not stop reports which disagree with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   As an international trading and financial  centre,\r\n\r\nit  is not in our interest to stop such reports.  But local  and\r\n\r\nforeign  newspapers must allow the Government to  correct  their\r\n\r\nunfair  or  inaccurate reports.  This is important  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must be able to put across its case to  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto which it is responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question is whether the local\r\n\r\nnewspaper  is  partisan as it does not, as both of  them  claim,\r\n\r\ngive the Opposition sufficient coverage during the GE.  This  is\r\n\r\na   matter  of  opinion.   Many  of  our  fellow  PAP  MPs  were\r\n\r\ncomplaining that they were not given enough coverage,  far  much\r\n\r\nless  than the Opposition during the GE.  On one-to-one, on  per\r\n\r\nsquare  inch covered by the newspapers during the GE, I can  bet\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition  got  far  more  coverage  than  the  Government\r\n\r\ncandidate.  Let us measure the pages, see the pictures, and  see\r\n\r\nits quantum coverage, including the heading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the NCMP, in his long speech, said that\r\n\r\npress  freedom  is the hallmark of a civil society  and  insists\r\n\r\nthat  a  free  press is an important institution to achieve  the\r\n\r\ntargeted  freedom of expression.  Let me remind the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nthat  in any country, America included, there must be some rules\r\n\r\npertaining to expression.  I read a report some time  ago,  when\r\n\r\nRupert  Murdoch wanted to buy a radio and TV network in America,\r\n\r\nhe  could  not do so because he is not an American.   He  is  an\r\n\r\nAustralian.   So  I  think it is not fair to impose  demands  on\r\n\r\nSingapore  when  in other countries, where the NCMP  had  quoted\r\n\r\nwidely  on  the so-called right of expression and freedom,  they\r\n\r\nare also having their own rules.  And we understand that this is\r\n\r\nhighly   necessary  for  a  society  to  have  some  regulation,\r\n\r\notherwise  it would not work.  He argued by saying  that  people\r\n\r\nhave the right to know.  Is he saying that the local\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npress  which  have shared increased circulation over  the  years\r\n\r\nhave  been  denying the readers from the information  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  looking for?  If that is the case, is it not only  logical\r\n\r\nfor  the  readers to react by not buying the newspaper and  thus\r\n\r\nreducing  the  circulation?  If that is  the  case,  how  do  we\r\n\r\nreconcile  the  point raised by my colleague, Mr Peh  Chin  Hua,\r\n\r\nthat  the circulation of all the newspapers, The Straits  Times,\r\n\r\nLianhe Zaobao, Berita Harian had increased?  Lack of choice?   I\r\n\r\nthink the answer is quite clear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lack of choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order, order. Mr Jeyaretnam, at least for\r\n\r\nthis  debate,  I  believe all MPs have sat down  listening  very\r\n\r\ncarefully to you.  So would you do the same?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sorry, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Yatiman Yusof:</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nIf  that  is  the  case, in an open market, in  a  free  market,\r\n\r\nreaders would react and the readers' reaction did not confirm Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam's assertion that they are being deprived  and  denied\r\n\r\nof  information.  So where is the logic of his argument?  And he\r\n\r\nargued that his principle of freedom of information and press is\r\n\r\nnot  only  western-oriented, it is  being  practised  in  India,\r\n\r\nThailand  and Sri Lanka.  I just want to ask him this  question:\r\n\r\nyes,  I  agree, but at what cost?  Look at Sri Lanka, India  and\r\n\r\nThailand.   They find great difficulties in achieving  consensus\r\n\r\nand   moving  the  society  towards  one  direction,   therefore\r\n\r\nproviding long-term benefit to every individual in society.   Is\r\n\r\nthat  not  a  more basic right than merely giving the  right  of\r\n\r\nexpression?  So these are the points which, I believe, must have\r\n\r\nbeen  misread by the NCMP and I hope his presentation would  not\r\n\r\ninfluence our mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he argued too that in order to be democratic, we must\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  what SM had said in 1950s and 1960s.   We  have  to\r\n\r\naccept  that time has changed and it requires intelligent-minded\r\n\r\npeople, rational people who believe in the future\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the  society,  to  think along the line  where  the  overall\r\n\r\nbenefit of the community is being secured first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many speakers had used the NPPA as an argument. I think all of\r\n\r\nthem, except one, used this argument either to hint that because\r\n\r\nof  the  NPPA  and  the presence of the management  shares,  the\r\n\r\neditors  and journalists are afraid, as what Mr Low Thia  Khiang\r\n\r\nsaid,  that the \"rice bowl\" factor can cause them to think twice\r\n\r\nand  protect their interest.  I was an editor before,  for  many\r\n\r\nyears.   I must confess to the House that under no circumstances\r\n\r\ndid  I move away from performing my duty as a responsible editor\r\n\r\nof a newspaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first take some time to explain this management\r\n\r\nshare  and  the  fear,  implication  and  imputation  that   the\r\n\r\nmanagement shares had been the key factor in -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) resulting with the Straits Times or SPH group losing\r\n\r\nits credibility among its readers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the feeling of fear among the editors, hence, self-censorship among them;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the income from advertisers; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the belief that editors can be changed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked for some figures on these, the total list of the SPH\r\n\r\nshares.  The management shares that we are talking about - every\r\n\r\nnewspaper  will have two types of shares:  ordinary  shares  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  shares.  For each management share, the holder  will\r\n\r\nhave 200 votes.  Let us go through the figures.  The SPH has, as\r\n\r\nI  was told, about 3.4 million management shares, multiplied  by\r\n\r\n200, it is translated into 740 million votes.  Out of these  740\r\n\r\nmillion  votes,  two-thirds  of  the  votes  belong  to  private\r\n\r\ncompanies.   Only  one-third of the votes, of  these  management\r\n\r\nshares,  are owned by the Singapore Telecommunications  Limited,\r\n\r\nthe  DBS, POSB - three major banks plus people that the NCMP had\r\n\r\nnamed, such as Mr Lim Kim San, Mr Michael Fam, Mr Lee Hee  Seng,\r\n\r\nMr  Wee  Cho  Yaw, Mr Tang I-Fang, Mr Tjong Yik Min,  Mr  Cheong\r\n\r\nChoong Kong.  These individuals of 10 persons\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave total votes of 2,000.  Together with these Government-owned\r\n\r\ncompanies and the 10 people, we have not more than one-third  of\r\n\r\nthe  share.  With one-third of the share, can we vote to  change\r\n\r\nthe  director  or the editor of a newspaper?  Simple  arithmetic\r\n\r\nwill say that this is not possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Government has no control whatsoever over the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  the editor or director of the SPH  because  the\r\n\r\nremaining  two-thirds of the voting powers are in the  hands  of\r\n\r\nprivate  companies  such  as the Great Eastern  Life  Assurance,\r\n\r\nOCBC,  Overseas Assurance Corporation Limited, UOB, OUB,  Fraser\r\n\r\nand  Neave.  These are companies with tremendous credential  and\r\n\r\nthey were successful because of their independent mindedness and\r\n\r\nthese are the groups that are holding majority share in the SPH.\r\n\r\nI  think once and for all, let us go through the figure, compute\r\n\r\nand   see  whether  all  these  assumptions,  presumptions   and\r\n\r\nimputations are true indeed.  But let me assure you,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, that this is not so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the speech made by the NMP, Mr Zulkifli, I am\r\n\r\nencouraged to hear that Mr Zulkifli feels an unfettered press is\r\n\r\nnot for Singapore and that some checks and guidelines need to be\r\n\r\nin  place.   In his speech, he gave six reasons why he supported\r\n\r\nthe   motion.   He  believes  that  there  should   be,   first,\r\n\r\ncompetition,  and  second, there must be debate  and  newspapers\r\n\r\nmust  provide these two elements - debate and competition.   His\r\n\r\nthird  and  fourth points are inter-related.   He  talked  about\r\n\r\nhaving  an independent but non-adversarial newspaper and claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the  Board  of Directors and the editor  of  the  SPH  are\r\n\r\ngenerally perceived as biased or pro-Government.  And  for  that\r\n\r\nreason, amongst others, the SPH has credibility problem with its\r\n\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained in terms of numbers, management shares which\r\n\r\nhave  been shrouded in darkness, that is not so.  The Government\r\n\r\ndoes  not appoint editors or the Board of Directors, though  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  approval  is  required  for  any  person  to  hold\r\n\r\nmanagement shares.  The whole point of management shares is so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat newspapers, which are important national institutions,  are\r\n\r\nrun  responsibly in the interest of Singapore.  Today, as I said\r\n\r\nearlier, the majority of the management shares are held  in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of the private people, by established corporations  which\r\n\r\nare   among  those  which  have  significantly  contributed   to\r\n\r\nSingapore's success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, Mr Zulklifi also talked about setting up of a Press\r\n\r\nCommission  or,  what he said, a Press Council.   In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nmany  different  professions  have come  together  to  establish\r\n\r\nbodies to cater to their respective professional interests,  set\r\n\r\nguidelines  to self-regulate their industry and so  forth.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the advertising industry has come together to  set  up\r\n\r\nASAS   and   the  broadcasters  have  set  up  the  Broadcasters\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore.  If the media fraternity  is  keen  on\r\n\r\nsetting  up  a body like a Press Council or Press Commission,  I\r\n\r\nthink it is for them to decide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he suggested that by providing freer environment, there\r\n\r\ncould  be a community-based newspaper being set up at the  local\r\n\r\nlevel,  say,  town council.  I would like to assure  the  Member\r\n\r\nthat, as the Minister has assured during the Budget Debate,  the\r\n\r\navenue  is  open.   And if it is commercially viable,  why  not?\r\n\r\nSomebody  should take the lead.  But we should leave it  to  the\r\n\r\ntown council or the regional council to decide.  Currently,  the\r\n\r\ntown  councils  I  understand,  are  having  their  own  monthly\r\n\r\nbulletins.  If some of them thought that they could run a  daily\r\n\r\nor  weekly publication, it is up to them and I think MITA  would\r\n\r\nlook at their application seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to comment on views expressed by other\r\n\r\nspeakers.   Mr Low Thia Khiang said that the SPH newspapers  are\r\n\r\nlike  flowers  blooming  from  one  stem,  if  I  may  translate\r\n\r\ncorrectly his metaphor.  But he again insinuated that it was not\r\n\r\nindependent and casts doubts on the merger of the Sin  Chew  Jit\r\n\r\nPoh  and Nanyang Siang Pao into Lianhe Zaobao and asked why Shin\r\n\r\nMin  decided not to be together.  I think the people who run the\r\n\r\nnewspapers will have valid commercial consideration  as  to  why\r\n\r\nShin Min must\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nremain  Shin Min and not being bound together and why  Sin  Chew\r\n\r\nJit  Poh  and Nanyang Siang Pao are kept together.  In Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwhere  they  have a similar paper, they remain so.  It  is  best\r\n\r\nthat  we do not speculate because I believe that it is purely  a\r\n\r\nbusiness consideration.  The question of NPPA, big bosses having\r\n\r\nclose  relationship with the Government and  the  psychology  of\r\n\r\nfear  and  the  rice bowl issues that he played up,  as  I  have\r\n\r\npointed  out  earlier,  have  no  basis  because  I  myself  had\r\n\r\nexperienced that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the points made by Mdm Claire Chiang, I respect her\r\n\r\nposition that she believes that there must be competition and an\r\n\r\nalternative view prevailing in Singapore.  But she leaves it for\r\n\r\nthe  market to decide whether this competition and provision  of\r\n\r\nalternative  view via the press could be sustained commercially.\r\n\r\nBut  when we talk about competition of ideas, the press  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  only media where such competition could take place.  People\r\n\r\nare  talking  about having a Hyde Park corner in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nfree  speech.  In fact, our Internet is far more effective, more\r\n\r\nblunt,  and  a more frank form of Hyde Park and it  spreads  far\r\n\r\nbeyond  the shores of Singapore.  I think that is the avenue  in\r\n\r\nwhich  everyone  can  move  into  and  use.   The  Minister,  in\r\n\r\nanswering a question earlier, had said that we do not think that\r\n\r\nwe  should  apply  high-handedness in imposing  censorship.   So\r\n\r\nthere is such a thing as an alternative media for us to go into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reasons I have stated, I urge Members of this\r\n\r\nChamber to reject the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am most grateful\r\n\r\nfor  the  views  that  have been expressed in  this  House  this\r\n\r\nafternoon  and particularly, I welcome the views that have  been\r\n\r\nexpressed by the two NMPs.  But before I reply to some of  these\r\n\r\npoints,  may  I make it quite clear that I am not advocating  or\r\n\r\nencouraging that control of our newspapers, the press, should be\r\n\r\nleft  in the hands of foreigners.  I thought that was clear from\r\n\r\nwhat I said.  It should be left in the hands of our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbut  not  in  the  hands  of  the Government.   The  fallacy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore is the impression that is sought to be created by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  that if you are a true Singaporean, if  you  are  a\r\n\r\nloyal  Singaporean,  then  you have  got  to  be  loyal  to  the\r\n\r\ngovernment of the day.  That is a complete fallacy.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nduty  of  a  citizen if he thinks that the Government  is  doing\r\n\r\nanything  that  is wrong, it is his bounden duty to  oppose  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, not to shout \"Aye, aye, aye\" to everything that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  says.   And in opposing the Government,  he  is  not\r\n\r\ndisloyal to Singapore.  On the contrary, he is showing where his\r\n\r\nloyalty  lies, with the people.  So, let us make it quite  clear\r\n\r\nthat  I  am not advocating that the control of our papers should\r\n\r\nbe placed in the hands of foreigners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not advocating that the press should be completely\r\n\r\nunregulated and should be free to publish seditious material  or\r\n\r\nmaterial  that might jeopardise the harmony that exists  between\r\n\r\nthe  various  communities or the different religious communities\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  But we have the laws of the land which take care\r\n\r\nof  that.  And any newspaper which falls foul of this law can be\r\n\r\ntaken  to  task  and prosecuted, and then, if necessary,  if  it\r\n\r\ncontinues, have its licence taken away.  The problem,  I  think,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, is the equation of the perspective  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  national  interests and the  goals  for  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nequated to what the Government, the party in power, decides what\r\n\r\nperspective it should be, what the national interest should  be,\r\n\r\nwhat  the  goals should be.  This is, as I said,  the antithesis\r\n\r\nof democracy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The balance of power should remain with the people and it is the\r\n\r\npeople  who should decide what the national interests are,  what\r\n\r\nthe  goals  are.  In this task of the people, the  duty  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, the press has an important role to play, as their voice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli also mentioned, as I did, about the establishment of\r\n\r\na  council.  We should think very seriously of moving away  from\r\n\r\nGovernment  regulation of the press to the public regulation  of\r\n\r\nthe press.  As I said, this was voiced in 1974 that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment had been thinking of a press council, but nothing has\r\n\r\ncome  of  it.  It is time we set up a press council in Singapore\r\n\r\ncomposed, as I said, not of people who see things the  way  that\r\n\r\nthe  PAP  sees  it or the Government sees it,  but  who  see  it\r\n\r\nindependently for Singapore as to what is good for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I come to reply to the points raised by the various\r\n\r\nspeakers.  The first speaker mentioned about Government  control\r\n\r\nin  Singapore being very minimal.  The perception, as  has  been\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Member for Hougang, among Singaporeans is  that\r\n\r\nthe  press  speaks  only  for  the  Government  and  it  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's voice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this Government control exists not by perhaps\r\n\r\nGovernment issuing orders day by day to the editors and  to  the\r\n\r\njournalists  in  the papers in Singapore, but the self-restraint\r\n\r\nor  censorship  that is practised by the press themselves.   You\r\n\r\nmay  recall,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think you  were  in  the\r\n\r\nHouse  then when I was here, when one paper, I think it was  the\r\n\r\nBusiness  Times or was it another paper, carried a  very  strong\r\n\r\neditorial on the pronouncement by the late Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  Mr Teh Cheang Wan, that opposition  constituencies\r\n\r\nwould be attended to last when it came to breakdowns of lifts or\r\n\r\nother emergency services.  The editorial took a very strong line\r\n\r\nagainst it, but what happened?  Within two hours or three hours,\r\n\r\nthat  issue  was  recalled and another issue was  published.   I\r\n\r\nbrought  this  up  in the House and I think it  was  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary who spoke on that and asked  whether  I\r\n\r\nwas  certain of what I was talking.  Then I was fortunate enough\r\n\r\nto hand to him and to this House the earlier paper that had come\r\n\r\nout  with a strong editorial.  I do not know, and we will  never\r\n\r\nknow, whether that was because of a Government telephone call or\r\n\r\na  directive or whether it was a decision taken by those who ran\r\n\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another instance, of course, that will be familiar to\r\n\r\nMembers,  of  the feature writer who wrote quite a mild  article\r\n\r\nabout  the  disaffection among the people with the PAP  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI  mentioned  this in our earlier debate.  Then  what  happened?\r\n\r\nShe  ceased to write for the Straits Times.  She was  no  longer\r\n\r\nwriting.   We  are  not  to know whether  it  was  a  Government\r\n\r\ndecision or whether it was a decision imposed by those who  have\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Straits Times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof. Tommy Koh observed in 1991, the press in Singapore has\r\n\r\nbeen  under a cloud of fear, and that is how Government  control\r\n\r\nis  maintained.   We  do  not need directives  issued  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  the  press  every day.   I  think  it  was  Lord\r\n\r\nThompson, who controls the Thompson group of newspapers, who was\r\n\r\nasked,  \"Do  you control what is published in your  newspapers?\"\r\n\r\nHe  said, \"No, I don't.

The Senior Parliamentary Secretary says Singaporeans have\r\n\r\ngreat  many  opportunities  for  speaking  up  or  disseminating\r\n\r\ninformation.   He  says  opposition  parties  can  hold   public\r\n\r\nmeetings.  They do not have to rely on the Straits Times.   What\r\n\r\nis  the  reality?  There is an opposition leader  who  is  being\r\n\r\nprosecuted  because  he  tried to hold  a  public  meeting.   It\r\n\r\nignores the realities in Singapore to say that Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nfree  to speak up and to disseminate information.  We are  still\r\n\r\ndependent  on a free press to speak up for us, and that  is  not\r\n\r\nhappening in Singapore.

The Ministry of  Health  is  still\r\n\r\ncommitted,  in principle, to fund the proposed redevelopment  of\r\n\r\nthe project.  However, the funds will only be made available for\r\n\r\nthe  project  in  the next year or two.  This  will  necessarily\r\n\r\ncause  the  project  to be shelved for the moment.   The  reason\r\n\r\ngiven  for  this  course  of action was that  the  total  budget\r\n\r\nallocation for development projects for the next few  years  has\r\n\r\nbeen cut because of the current economic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to beseech the Ministry of Health for a\r\n\r\nreappraisal of the situation and seek a positive response for  a\r\n\r\nchange   in  direction  and  emphasis  towards  this   area   of\r\n\r\nhealthcare.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  try  and  influence  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  this House and the Minister for Health  with  the\r\n\r\nfollowing reasons:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) We are facing a shortfall of nursing-home beds now.\r\n\r\nThere  are  about  4,700 nursing-home beds available  while,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  we need about 6,000 beds.  We are short of 1,300 even  as\r\n\r\nof  now.   The  need  for more nursing-home beds  will  increase\r\n\r\nexponentially  due to our fast-ageing population.  It  has  been\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we  will meet an increase in  demand  of  about\r\n\r\n22,000  such beds by the year 2030.  There is really a need  for\r\n\r\nthis  big  task of providing a further 15,000 nursing-home  beds\r\n\r\nwithin  the  next 30 years.  There is a need to expedite  rather\r\n\r\nthan  to  shelve the building of more nursing homes in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  current  economic downturn.  I would urge the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  to seriously give this area more weightage and increased\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The cost of maintaining a patient in an acute hospital\r\n\r\nis  about  S$290  per  day, whereas the cost  of  maintaining  a\r\n\r\npatient  in a nursing home is about S$25.  It does make economic\r\n\r\nsense,  therefore, to make sure that there are  enough  nursing-home  beds  for  patients to be placed out  from  acute-hospital\r\n\r\nbeds.   Presently, on any given day, there are 120 \"overstayers\"\r\n\r\nin  our acute hospitals.  These patients who are well enough  to\r\n\r\nbe  discharged from the acute-care hospitals do require  further\r\n\r\ncare.   However,  they should ideally be sent to nursing  homes.\r\n\r\nNot  only do they deprive other acutely ill patients of beds  in\r\n\r\nthe  acute  hospitals, they are also costing the  country  S$1.6\r\n\r\nmillion per year.  Sir, this is unnecessarily wasteful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Nursing-home beds are for patients who are not fit to\r\n\r\nbe  discharged  to their own homes.  They still require  special\r\n\r\ndaily  care and they are dependent on others for daily routines.\r\n\r\nIf  these patients are forcibly returned to their own homes, the\r\n\r\nburden  on  their  family members will be tremendous.   Many  of\r\n\r\nthese  patients  are  indeed frail  and  elderly.   It  will  be\r\n\r\ndisastrous if we cannot cater for them in the future.  Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  foresee problems arising from  an  increasing\r\n\r\nnumber of the aged with a decreasing number of the young looking\r\n\r\nafter  them.   Problems will also arise because  there  will  be\r\n\r\nfewer  care-givers  at  home due to an increase  of  dual-income\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) There will always be those who argue that substantial\r\n\r\nnumbers   of   people  would  prefer  home  care   rather   than\r\n\r\ninstitutional care and that the necessity for even more  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes begs justification.  The truth is that, although home care\r\n\r\nmay  be  preferred, it may not be ideal for many.  One  or  more\r\n\r\nfamily members would have to stop work and stay at home to  take\r\n\r\ncare of these dependent patients.  Healthcare personnel such  as\r\n\r\ndoctors,  nurses, and physiotherapists would  have  to  go  from\r\n\r\nhouse  to house to check on the patients.  This would mean fewer\r\n\r\npatients seen each day and higher opportunity costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The nursing homes in Singapore are usually built and\r\n\r\nrun  jointly  by the voluntary organisations and the Government.\r\n\r\nThere  is  a need for constant and conscientious effort  to  woo\r\n\r\nmore  voluntary organisations to participate and  help  in  this\r\n\r\narea of healthcare.  Such organisations do not come on stream as\r\n\r\nand  when  we like them to.  Therefore, there are no  guarantees\r\n\r\nthat we will be getting a constant and continuous stream of them\r\n\r\nas  and  when the demand arises.  Sir, I feel that it  would  be\r\n\r\nprudent  that  we  do  not  turn  away  any  offers  from  these\r\n\r\norganisations  even,  and  especially,  during  these  difficult\r\n\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) It is a prerequisite of the voluntary organisations that\r\n\r\nthey  take  on  some of the building and running  costs  of  the\r\n\r\nnursing homes.  These costs, which usually run into millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars, have to be raised through annual fund-raising projects.\r\n\r\nMoney from well-wishers are an important source of funds and  it\r\n\r\nis wise to stagger fund-raising projects so as not to overburden\r\n\r\nthe  well-wishers  and  thus jeopardise the  smooth  running  of\r\n\r\nexisting nursing homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) We should capitalise on this economic crisis and take the\r\n\r\nopportunities  presented  by cheaper building  and  construction\r\n\r\ncosts.  This is, in fact, one of the appeal reasons put forth by\r\n\r\nthe  Kwong  Wai Shiu Hospital and Nursing Home.  A rather  valid\r\n\r\nreason indeed and it should support the request for the Ministry\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHealth to repeal earlier decisions.  Prime Minister Goh, only  a\r\n\r\nfew  days ago, said that his own feeling was that this year  was\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  a tough year.  The Government would look  towards\r\n\r\nspending  on infrastructure to keep the economy going.  Building\r\n\r\nmore nursing homes would fit nicely into this strategy and would\r\n\r\nalleviate the shortage we face at present.  Therefore, it  would\r\n\r\nbe  better that we accelerate rather than shelve the building of\r\n\r\nmore nursing homes now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) The shortage of nursing-home beds will be compounded next\r\n\r\nyear when the Ministry of Health introduces a new funding system\r\n\r\nfor  our  public  hospitals.  Presently,  public  hospitals  are\r\n\r\nfunded  on a per-patient-day basis.  In other words, the  longer\r\n\r\nthe  patient stays in hospital the more the hospital gets.  This\r\n\r\nis to change when funding will be based on diagnosis of diseases\r\n\r\nand  the  resources required by patients.  The funding mechanism\r\n\r\nis  derived  from  a  system of case and disease  classification\r\n\r\ntermed  Casemix  and  Diagnosis Related Groups  (or  DRGs)   The\r\n\r\nintroduction   of   Casemix  and  DRGs  is  to   help   hospital\r\n\r\nadministrators  and doctors to contain healthcare  costs.   This\r\n\r\nsystem  will  certainly pressurise the acute-care hospitals  for\r\n\r\ndischarge of low-funded or non-funded DRGs cases to the  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes.  The demand for nursing homes will undoubtedly increase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The financial burden upon the \"no-choice overstayers\" in\r\n\r\nour acute hospitals will also be multiplied when the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth introduces the new system next year.  This is because the\r\n\r\nuse  of  Medisave  will also be based on the  Casemix  and  DRGs\r\n\r\nClassification.  The patients will have to pay for the expensive\r\n\r\nacute-beds with meagre Medisave deductions.  They will  need  to\r\n\r\nfork out much cash for \"overstaying\" in such acute-care beds due\r\n\r\nto a forced circumstance.  They suffer for not having the choice\r\n\r\nof transfer to a ten times cheaper alternative - a nursing home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having said the aforementioned, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  stress  the importance of a couple of  related  issues\r\n\r\nwhich  also  warrant  our attention.   We  need  to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nreduction in demand for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeds  in our hospitals and nursing homes.  We will also need  to\r\n\r\nlook  into alternative and additional ways for patients to  have\r\n\r\nfunds  for out-of-hospital expenses.  Let us consider these  two\r\n\r\nissues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) You will agree with me that we should practise the\r\n\r\n\"prevention is better than cure\" policy, as far as healthcare is\r\n\r\nconcerned.   Sir, \"preventive healthcare\" is the key to  success\r\n\r\nin  coping  with  future  healthcare  problems.   Revamping  and\r\n\r\ninvesting well in this area will reap us abundant rewards in the\r\n\r\nfuture.   There is still a lot that can be done.  Prevention  of\r\n\r\ndisease and promotion of healthy lifestyle should be targeted at\r\n\r\neveryone.   Due  to time constraint, I would  not  go  into  the\r\n\r\ndetails.   The topic of preventive healthcare alone  will  merit\r\n\r\nanother adjournment motion by itself!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) In the area of healthcare financing, there is still\r\n\r\nsomething  amiss despite Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.   To\r\n\r\nrepeat  what  I  suggested in this House, we need  a  co-payment\r\n\r\ninsurance  scheme  to cater for long-term care outside  hospital\r\n\r\nsettings.   I  would  call  this  \"Medicare\".   \"Medicare\"  will\r\n\r\nprovide  for burdensome and chronic but non-institutional  care.\r\n\r\nIn   some   instances,  this  may  actually  be  the   preferred\r\n\r\nalternative  care  -  \"home-care\".  This will  reduce  the  load\r\n\r\nplaced  on hospitals and nursing homes.  Presently, the facility\r\n\r\nto use Medisave only for hospital and nursing home admissions is\r\n\r\nan  important  consideration causing  many  patients  to  favour\r\n\r\ninstitutional-care  instead of home-care.   This,  again,  is  a\r\n\r\nwaste of expensive resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let us give special attention to these\r\n\r\nseemingly  remote  issues, even as we cope  with  this  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis.   It is far-sighted vision and far-reaching preparation,\r\n\r\nthe  hallmark  of  the PAP Government, which  will  prevent  and\r\n\r\ncushion Singaporeans from catastrophes in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is not shelving the development\r\n\r\nof  nursing  homes.   On  the contrary, we  are  expediting  and\r\n\r\nbuilding more nursing homes.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is fully aware of the need to plan for the long-term care facilities for the elderly sick. Not every sick\r\n\r\nelderly  person requires institutionalisation.  According  to  a\r\n\r\nstudy  done  by  the Ministry of Health a few  years  back,  our\r\n\r\nestimate  is that only about 3% of the total elderly  population\r\n\r\naged  65  years and above need some form of institutional  care.\r\n\r\nMOH  has  been  actively  working  with  the  Voluntary  Welfare\r\n\r\nOrganisations (VWOs) to build nursing homes and help  those  who\r\n\r\nare interested in doing so.  Indeed, I agree with the Member, Dr\r\n\r\nLily Neo, that nursing homes by far are a cheaper alternative to\r\n\r\nhaving   patients  staying  unnecessarily  long  in  our   acute\r\n\r\nhospitals.   Irrespective  of  the Casemix  formula  of  funding\r\n\r\nhospitals, which is actually still at the trial stage, there  is\r\n\r\nneed  for  us  to provide the cheaper alternative, that  is,  in\r\n\r\nterms of nursing homes for the elderly patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, many VWOs have problems implementing their projects on\r\n\r\ntime.  The length of time taken for a project to be approved for\r\n\r\nfunding  is  dependent  on  the  VWO's  proposal  meeting  MOH's\r\n\r\nguideline  on  the  setting up of nursing  homes  and  also  the\r\n\r\nobtaining  of  the  necessary approvals from various  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  The average time taken for a project  plan  to  be\r\n\r\nfinalised  is around two years.  But there are often  delays  in\r\n\r\nthe planning and design phase carried out by the VWOs, and these\r\n\r\nare  due  to  several factors.  Firstly, the VWOs  tend  to  far\r\n\r\nexceed  the  space norms for approved facilities and they  often\r\n\r\nwant to include facilities which turn out to be not eligible for\r\n\r\nGovernment  funding.  So, much time has to be spent at  meetings\r\n\r\nwith the VWOs and their architects to assist them to revise  the\r\n\r\nplans until they meet the MOH's requirements.  The other reasons\r\n\r\nfor  the delays include delay in identifying suitable sites, the\r\n\r\ntime   required  to  assess  community  reaction,   the   formal\r\n\r\nallocation of site and the need to coordinate with various other\r\n\r\nagencies  on the plans, such as with the URA, Land Office,  PWD,\r\n\r\nLTA,  and so on.  The construction itself takes another  1.5  to\r\n\r\ntwo  years.   So under the present procedures, the minimum  time\r\n\r\nrequired  is 3.5 to four years for a development project  to  be\r\n\r\ncompleted.  We have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreviewed the process with a view to expediting the time required\r\n\r\nfor project approval.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that presently we have a shortfall of nursing home\r\n\r\nbeds.   However, according to our latest projections, we  should\r\n\r\nbe  able  to correct this shortfall within the next five  years.\r\n\r\nLet  me elaborate.  At the end of 1998, there were around  4,600\r\n\r\navailable  nursing  home beds.  The shortfall  was  1,600  beds.\r\n\r\nThis  shortfall is higher than the 1,300 beds quoted by Dr  Neo,\r\n\r\nbecause  she  was referring to 1997 figures.  The background  is\r\n\r\nthat  between  1996 and 1998, there were only four nursing  home\r\n\r\nprojects  (two  were  new homes and two were replacement  homes)\r\n\r\nwhich  were  completed.  And this added only  450  beds  to  our\r\n\r\nsupply  of  beds.   So  there  was  a  slight  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nshortfall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are stepping up our assistance to the VWOs. And we are\r\n\r\ncurrently  working with 12 VWOs to build nursing homes  to  meet\r\n\r\nthis  shortfall.  These projects are already in various advanced\r\n\r\nstages  of  development.  Between 1999 and 2001, there  will  be\r\n\r\nnine  new  and  replacement projects which  will  be  completed,\r\n\r\nadding  another 2,000 beds.  This would give a total  supply  of\r\n\r\naround  6,400  beds.   When this is compared  to  the  projected\r\n\r\nrequirement  of 6,750 beds, the shortfall will be  reduced  very\r\n\r\nsignificantly to only 350 beds in two years.  With more  nursing\r\n\r\nhome  projects coming on-stream between the year 2002 and  2003,\r\n\r\nthere  will be another 1,000 beds added to the stock,  and  this\r\n\r\nwill,  in  fact,  wipe  out the shortfall.   There  will  be  no\r\n\r\nshortfall by the year 2003.  The total supply of available  beds\r\n\r\nby  the  year  2003 will be 7,400, which is in  contrast  to  an\r\n\r\nearlier  estimate we made in 1997, that only 6,600 nursing  beds\r\n\r\nwould be available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised figure is made possible because last year, we\r\n\r\nreviewed  the nursing home building programme and re-prioritised\r\n\r\nthe  projects  to ensure that those that could  be  moved  ahead\r\n\r\nfaster  would receive higher priority for funding.  New  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes that would add more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnursing   home  beds  compared  with  replacement  or  upgrading\r\n\r\nprojects and those that could be put up at a lower cost received\r\n\r\npriority   funding.    As  a  result  of  our  re-prioritisation\r\n\r\nexercise,  we  were able to increase the number of nursing  home\r\n\r\nbeds  available by the year 2003 from 6,600 to 7,400.  As I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  by the year 2003, we do not expect any shortfall  and  we\r\n\r\nwould maintain this balance.  Furthermore, we have begun to work\r\n\r\nwith  other VWOs on planning for nursing homes to come on-stream\r\n\r\nbeyond the year 2003.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member mentioned that there would be a requirement of 22,000\r\n\r\nnursing  home beds by the year 2030.  But this is more  than  30\r\n\r\nyears  down  the  road.   With the new  momentum  that  we  have\r\n\r\ncreated,  we are confident that by that time, we would be  amply\r\n\r\nprepared to meet the projected demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that besides nursing homes, we are also\r\n\r\nstepping  up  the provision of other long-term care  facilities,\r\n\r\nsuch  as community hospital beds and chronic sick beds.  By  the\r\n\r\nyear  2003, there would be an increase of 800 community hospital\r\n\r\nbeds and chronic sick beds.  Currently, there is no shortage  of\r\n\r\nplaces at the day rehabilitation centres.  However, there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  to  provide home care services.  As the Member so  rightly\r\n\r\npointed out, some patients could be taken care of at home and it\r\n\r\nmight  be  better for them to be cared for by family members  or\r\n\r\ncare-givers.   So MOH is encouraging more VWOs to provide  home-care services for the elderly sick.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to provide financial assistance to\r\n\r\nVWOs  for  the  development of facilities and services  for  the\r\n\r\nelderly sick.  I would like to stress that funds provided by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance have not been reduced, despite the economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.  Between 1996 and 1998, we have provided $33.4 million\r\n\r\nto  nursing home projects.  Between 1999 and the year  2001,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be providing $131 million.  If you take into consideration\r\n\r\nthe other long-term care facilities, such as community hospitals\r\n\r\nand chronic sick hospitals, then, from now till the year\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2003,  MOH expects to spend $235 million to assist the  VWOs  to\r\n\r\nbuild these long-term facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital, as we explained in the\r\n\r\nwritten  answer to the Member already, is that originally,  they\r\n\r\nhad  a  very  grand  plan  of building a 1,500-bed  convalescent\r\n\r\nhospital cum nursing home.  We went back to them and asked  them\r\n\r\nto  reconsider  the  plan.   We  asked  them  whether  this  was\r\n\r\nrealistic   in  terms  of  the  resources  and  so   on.     The\r\n\r\nredevelopment  plan  is now still at the concept  stage  and  is\r\n\r\nbeing revised.  Once the details are firmed up, we will be  able\r\n\r\nto  work  out  the funding details.  So we are  asking  them  to\r\n\r\nrevise  the plan and to be more realistic and more effective  so\r\n\r\nas to meet with our requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say that MOH is not only concerned\r\n\r\nwith   the  availability  of  long-term  care  services.   These\r\n\r\nservices  must  meet certain standards set by  my  Ministry  for\r\n\r\nobvious  reasons, like physical standards and  quality  of  care\r\n\r\nprovided  for patients.  We have drawn up guidelines on physical\r\n\r\nfacilities and the staffing ratio already.  Guidelines  on  care\r\n\r\nstandards  are also being developed.  Once these are  developed,\r\n\r\nthey  would  apply to all the nursing homes and other  long-term\r\n\r\ncare facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to ensure that individuals are able to\r\n\r\nfinance  their own long-term care needs, especially  during  old\r\n\r\nage,  and  this  is  apart  from Government  subsidies  and  the\r\n\r\nsubsidies  provided  by  the  VWOs  through  their  fund-raising\r\n\r\nefforts.  We recognise and appreciate the efforts put in by  the\r\n\r\nVWOs in raising funds, in providing the services, in running the\r\n\r\nhomes and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity hospitals.  In fact, we are deliberating on how we can\r\n\r\nhelp  them  to reduce their load of fund-raising.  We  are  also\r\n\r\nconsidering how individuals and families could be helped,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom  Medisave and MediShield, to finance their share  of  long-term care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Healthcare for the Elderly\r\n\r\nhas  considered the suggestions which have been put  forward  by\r\n\r\nits  members  and by members of the community.  Its  report  and\r\n\r\nrecommendations will be released soon.  So I would not  disclose\r\n\r\nfurther details on these financing aspects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I agree with Dr Lily Neo, I agree very much indeed - and this has been the emphasis of my work in the Ministry in the\r\n\r\npast  years  -  that everybody, whether young or old,  must  put\r\n\r\nemphasis  on leading a healthy lifestyle.  This is the best  way\r\n\r\nto  cut  down the burden of his own healthcare costs, the burden\r\n\r\nto  his  family, to the community and, eventually, also  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   because   the   Government   heavily    subsidises\r\n\r\nhealthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to conclude by saying that we are committed to\r\n\r\nensuring  that  the elderly have access to affordable  long-term\r\n\r\ncare, but health is also very much in our own hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Nineteen</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes past Eight o'clock pm to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Friday, 26th February, 1999.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HOSPITALISATION AND MEDICAL EXPENSES FOR PERSONS ABOVE 55 YEARS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth,  from 1994 to 1998, (a) how many persons above 55  years\r\n\r\nold  without savings in the Central Provident Fund were admitted\r\n\r\nto  hospitals;  (b) how many in this age category with  Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts were unable to meet their medical expenses; and (c) how\r\n\r\nthe hospitals handled these cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, our public hospitals saw 80,000 hospital\r\n\r\nadmissions involving Singaporeans and PRs aged 55 and above. The\r\n\r\nhospitals  do  not track whether patients have  savings  in  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund.  About 38%  of  them  used  their  own\r\n\r\nMedisave  savings  to pay at least part of  the  hospital  bill.\r\n\r\nAnother  50%  of  patients used the Medisave of their  immediate\r\n\r\nfamily  members.

They usually would accept the  Ministry's\r\n\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of our investigations, we have discovered that job\r\n\r\nadvertisements  citing  a  preference for  a  particular  ethnic\r\n\r\nbackground were often misrepresented.  Employers explained  that\r\n\r\nthey  wanted  candidates who were able  to  speak  a  particular\r\n\r\nlanguage  and that since candidates of other racial groups  were\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  meet the language requirement, they felt  that  it\r\n\r\nwould  be more expedient to stipulate a particular race in their\r\n\r\njob  advertisements.   This  would also  spare  the  efforts  of\r\n\r\napplicants  who  did  not  have the necessary  requirements,  in\r\n\r\napplying    for   the   job   and   attending   to   interviews.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this explanation, the Ministry had  pointed  out\r\n\r\nto  such  employers  that  citing  racial  preference  or  other\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory factors should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to emphasise that this problem resides\r\n\r\nin a minority of employers and often in small companies.  We are\r\n\r\nof  the  view  that an educational and promotional  approach  is\r\n\r\npreferable  to  legislation  in dealing  with  this  issue.  The\r\n\r\nproblem  with legislation is that it would create rigidities  in\r\n\r\nthe job market which would be detrimental to economic growth and\r\n\r\njob  creation.  For  example, there  would  be  instances  where\r\n\r\nbusiness and job requirements would compel an employer  to  look\r\n\r\nfor  persons  of  a  particular  background  compatible  to  the\r\n\r\nrequirements. Similarly, where a job requires physical  strength\r\n\r\nsuch as handling heavy machinery in a shipyard, it would be more\r\n\r\nappropriate  for the employer to recruit a younger  male  worker\r\n\r\nwho is able to cope with the job requirement. On the other hand,\r\n\r\nin  the  cosmetic business, the employers would want  to  employ\r\n\r\nyounger  females  instead  of  older  males  to  promote   their\r\n\r\nproducts.   These  are market requirements  and  should  not  be\r\n\r\nmisconstrued as discrimination.   I would also like to point out\r\n\r\nthat  experience  in other countries has shown that  legislation\r\n\r\nmay  not  solve  the problem.  Instead, it often leads  to  high\r\n\r\nincidences of litigation and controversies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue of discrimination had not been raised for the past 10\r\n\r\nyears  when  we enjoyed sustained economic growth and negligible\r\n\r\nunemployment.  I have no doubt that in 1996 and 1997, there were\r\n\r\nsimilarly  inappropriately  phrased recruitment  advertisements.\r\n\r\nYet  we only received 9 complaints in 1996 and 16 complaints  in\r\n\r\n1997.   Last year, we had 32 complaints.  We believe this  trend\r\n\r\nreflects    the   rising   unemployment   rather    than    real\r\n\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the above, my Ministry therefore prefers to\r\n\r\nadopt  an  educational  and moral suasion  approach  by  working\r\n\r\ntogether  with employers' organisations to advise  employers  to\r\n\r\npromote  non-discriminatory recruitment practices based  on  the\r\n\r\nworkers' skills and capabilities and not on factors which are of\r\n\r\nno  relevance to the job.   In labour scarce Singapore, it is in\r\n\r\nthe  interests of employers to reach out to all Singaporeans who\r\n\r\ncan  do  the work and help the company to compete.  This is  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  our meritocratic approach which has served  Singapore\r\n\r\nwell.  By adopting discriminatory practice, an employer is  only\r\n\r\nshortchanging himself.  This will become more apparent when  the\r\n\r\neconomy recovers in a year or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT AND SUCCESS RATE OF JOB PLACEMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)\r\n\r\nhow many people were laid off as at the end of 1998; (b) what is\r\n\r\nthe  success  rate  of  job placements; and  (c)  whether  older\r\n\r\nworkers  will  face long-term unemployment of up to  a  year  or\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest preliminary estimates based on a survey of private\r\n\r\nsector  establishments with at least 25 employees revealed  that\r\n\r\naround  7,200 workers were retrenched in the fourth  quarter  of\r\n\r\n1998,  higher than the 6,000 estimated previously.  This  brings\r\n\r\nthe retrenchment figure for the whole of 1998 to 28,300 workers,\r\n\r\nthe  highest ever recorded since the last economic recession  in\r\n\r\n1985, which saw 19,529 workers laid off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower provides employment assistance to all\r\n\r\njob  seekers who are Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents.\r\n\r\nOwing  to  the  economic  downturn, the number  of  job  seekers\r\n\r\nregistered with the Ministry had quadrupled from 4,777  in  1997\r\n\r\nto 19,784 in 1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the Ministry was able to provide job referrals to\r\n\r\nabout  78%  of  all  registrants.

If\r\n\r\nthe  economy turns around within a year or two, such a  scenario\r\n\r\nis  unlikely.   Of the locals retrenched in the  first  half  of\r\n\r\n1998, 65% were re-employed as at September 1998.  Among those re-employed, the average time taken to obtain re-employment was 1.6\r\n\r\nmonths. Older workers may face more difficulty e.g. only 52%  of\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  age group 50 and above were re-employed,  taking\r\n\r\nalso on average 1.6 months to secure re-employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better the older workers' re-employment prospects, my\r\n\r\nMinistry  held many discussions with employers to urge  them  to\r\n\r\nlook  beyond  the  age factor when recruiting workers.  We  have\r\n\r\nemphasized  to  them  that the older  workers  can  be  just  as\r\n\r\nproductive.   We  are also providing skill-upgrading  for  older\r\n\r\nworkers  who  face  the risk of retrenchment or  who  have  been\r\n\r\nretrenched.   For  instance, the newly established  Bukit  Merah\r\n\r\nSkill  Development Centre is currently training about 400  older\r\n\r\nworkers including many who had been retrenched.  Skill upgrading\r\n\r\ncan help workers to remain employable. Retraining can facilitate\r\n\r\ntheir  redeployment to new jobs in a different sector.

Even\r\n\r\nbefore  the  regional  crisis  affected  us,  the  Ministry  has\r\n\r\nundertaken various activities and programmes such as  the  \"Back\r\n\r\nto  Work\" Programme, to help facilitate the employment of  older\r\n\r\npersons.   The  thrust  of our effort is  to  change  employers'\r\n\r\nmindset  on  the  employment of older persons and  to  encourage\r\n\r\nemployers  to  provide  job  opportunities  for  them.  On   the\r\n\r\nlegislative front, the retirement age has also been raised  from\r\n\r\n60  to 62 from January 1999, to help older workers stay on their\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the current economic situation, job seekers,\r\n\r\nregardless of age or educational level, are finding it difficult\r\n\r\nto  secure  a job. The situation may continue to be so  for  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  1999.  The Ministry is aware that the older  and  less\r\n\r\neducated  job  seekers  face  tougher  challenges.     We   have\r\n\r\ntherefore placed greater emphasis on helping them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring the recruitment situation for\r\n\r\nsome time.  We hold discussions with employers to encourage them\r\n\r\nto  employ older persons and to identify suitable jobs for them.\r\n\r\nWe  visit selected companies together with representatives  from\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Productivity and Standards Board, the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Employers  Federation and the  National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress  to better understand the issues faced by employers  in\r\n\r\nthe  management  of older persons. We have also  impressed  upon\r\n\r\nemployers  that certain jobs could be restructured or redesigned\r\n\r\nto  make  them  suitable for older workers to handle.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  with  our  efforts  to  help  change  the  mindset  of\r\n\r\nemployers and to assist the older workers find alternative jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INITIATIVES TO ASSIST BUSINESSMEN IN EXPLORATION INTO NEW</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MARKETS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry\r\n\r\nif  his Ministry intends to supplement its current schemes  with\r\n\r\nany  initiatives to assist businessmen in their exploration into\r\n\r\nnew markets beyond this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, several schemes are in place to help companies to\r\n\r\nregionalise and explore new markets.

AH  operates  a\r\n\r\nGeriatric Day Hospital and a Geriatric Ward, and runs programmes\r\n\r\non  various  aspects of geriatric care, including rehabilitation\r\n\r\ntraining, managing geriatric-orthopaedic cases and training care-givers in geriatric care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing range of medical services is already quite\r\n\r\ncomprehensive and is serving patients well.

As of end-1998, 98.3% of all households and businesses\r\n\r\nin Singapore have been wired up such that they can access S-ONE.\r\n\r\nThere  are now more than 14,000 subscribers to S-ONE that access\r\n\r\nvia  cable modems and ADSL telephone lines, as well as more than\r\n\r\n7,600  S-ONE public access nodes installed in schools,  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions,  libraries and community clubs and  centres.

Some schools have set up their  websites  on  the\r\n\r\nInternet and include educational resources for pupils to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CHINESE LANGUAGE AND UNIVERSITY ADMISSION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwhether  his Ministry has collated any statistics on the  number\r\n\r\nof  students  who scored excellent grades in other subjects  but\r\n\r\nwere  unable  to enter local universities simply on  account  of\r\n\r\ntheir  failure in the Chinese language subject at their  O-level\r\n\r\nand A-level examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission into NUS/NTU is based primarily on A-Level\r\n\r\npoints.  The maximum is 76 points, 20 points each for 3 A  level\r\n\r\nsubjects  and 8 points each for General Paper and Mother  Tongue\r\n\r\n(MT)  taken at the AO level.  Applicants compete on their  total\r\n\r\npoints.  A student who scores excellent grades in other subjects\r\n\r\nbut  fail  their  Mother Tongue may have higher points  than  an\r\n\r\naverage  student who passes Mother Tongue.  However,  a  student\r\n\r\nwho  does not meet the Mother Tongue requirement (D7 or  better)\r\n\r\nwill  be  offered provisional admission.  During  his  1st  year\r\n\r\nundergraduate  vacation, he must undergo  an  intensive  1-month\r\n\r\nmother tongue course and pass the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thus no students with excellent grades who could\r\n\r\nnot get into the university because of MT.  Those who failed  MT\r\n\r\nand  were not accepted into University because their results for\r\n\r\nthe other subjects were poor as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For academic year 98/99, a total of 21 students were\r\n\r\nprovisionally admitted into NUS/NTU on the grounds that they had\r\n\r\nfailed to obtain at least a D7 in their Chinese Language.   This\r\n\r\nis  0.3%  of the 7000 (approx.) JC/CI students who were admitted\r\n\r\ninto  NUS/NTU.  The percentage of students who are provisionally\r\n\r\nadmitted because of poor performance in MT is very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
