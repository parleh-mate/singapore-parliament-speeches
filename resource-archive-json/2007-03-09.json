The bulk of our efforts was focused on the 2004 tsunami.&nbsp; The SAF and SCDF provided emergency logistics support and medical relief to the people of Meulaboh, the worst hit area in Aceh.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3469<p>NGOs, such as the Singapore Red Cross and Mercy Relief, played their part.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans contributed generously while others gave their time.&nbsp; In all, Singapore provided more than S$70 million in tsunami assistance.&nbsp; Thanks to these efforts, life in Meulaboh has returned to normal.&nbsp; Beyond the tsunami, Singapore has provided assistance to Indonesia during the Nias earthquake in March 2005, the subsequent earthquake in Central Java in 2006 and, more recently, the floods in Jakarta.&nbsp; Much of our assistance takes the form of essential items such as medical supplies, tents and blankets.&nbsp; Singapore is a small country. &nbsp;What we can offer cannot be compared to the contributions from larger donors.&nbsp; But when disaster strikes, Singaporeans have shown time and time again that they are more than willing to come to the help of our neighbours.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, in view of the negative comments coming out of Indonesia recently, many Singaporeans have asked, should we continue to assist and whether, in view of many&nbsp;more natural disasters that might crop up, eg, recently, even ourselves in Singapore, we have had these tremors, should we commit our resources further towards this?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Balaji Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Balaji Sadasivan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I can understand why some Singaporeans are questioning our continuing assistance to our neighbours, despite their unfriendly remarks against us.&nbsp; But I do not believe that we should stop being helpful even when there are difficulties in bilateral relations.&nbsp; As Minister George Yeo said in his COS speech on Monday, when he spoke about our relations with Indonesia:&nbsp; \"We should still help them when they are in difficulty not because we expect gratitude or reward, but because that is the right thing to do.\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3470<p>As this House is aware, Singapore and Indonesia are close neighbours.&nbsp; The relationship is broad-based.&nbsp; From time to time, there will be periodic ups and downs.&nbsp; We should expect these.&nbsp; But we should respond in a mature manner.&nbsp; We should not hold back helping our neighbours during times of need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this regard, as I noted earlier, Singaporeans have been more than willing to come to the help of our neighbours when disaster strikes.&nbsp; To cite just a few examples: in the aftermath of the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami, the Singapore Red Cross collected S$88 million from Singaporeans for their Tidal Waves Asia Fund. &nbsp;More recently, during the recent floods in Jakarta, our Muslim community here raised S$72,000 for the flood victims.&nbsp; The Singaporean community in Jakarta also rallied together and contributed relief aid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We should be proud of the fact that many of our fellow Singaporeans are generous and civic-minded.&nbsp; This augurs well for the people-to-people relations between Singapore and our neighbours.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Mr Teo Ser Luck):</B> I think I am going to have more than 30 seconds, so I can speak slower.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MCYS' vision is to nurture inspired and committed youth who will make a positive difference to the country.&nbsp; I am glad Mr Sin Boon Ann asked how we can&nbsp;connect with the youth and ensure a deep-rooted sense of their identity as Singaporeans.&nbsp; We have done a lot of work, set up many programmes.&nbsp; We want to give the youth a say in issues that matter to them, a stake and ownership in the long-term well-being of the community, and support to achieve their hopes and dreams and whatever they want to undertake, especially for&nbsp;our at-risk youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has spent the last year consolidating and expanding our youth programmes.&nbsp; These youth programmes can be broadly categorised into three different areas:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Youth expression;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; Youth spaces; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; Encouraging youth volunteerism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is in keeping with the spirit of our approach, and all of these programmes<p align=left>Column: 3472<p> are youth-led and youth-driven.&nbsp; We do not believe in a top-down prescriptive approach.&nbsp; It is best to let the youth do the things that they are passionate about.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For youth expression, one of the key initiatives is our SHINE Youth Festival in July, which is a platform for all our young people to organise events showcasing their talents and their&nbsp;contributions to the community.&nbsp; I am glad to say that SHINE surpassed its previous year's performance to reach a total of 180,000 youth over 117 events.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also present in the new and mainstream media.&nbsp; For the new media, we have created platforms for youth&nbsp;expressions that include Youth.SG, an Internet portal, which is run by youth for youth.&nbsp; The <I>Straits Times'</I> <I>YouthInk</I> pages, run&nbsp;every Monday, has featured more than 200 youth writers to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that.&nbsp; Besides platforms for them to have their views expressed on paper or the Internet, they can&nbsp;also talk to our leaders directly.&nbsp; We have feedback and consultation platforms, such as the Community Outreach Group Dialogues, spearheaded by some of the younger Members of the House and also the Prime Minister's Dialogue which&nbsp;provides opportunities for youth to air their views on national issues and share their aspirations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These programmes complement National Education, and&nbsp;I am glad&nbsp;that MOS Lui Tuck Yew mentioned that there would be increasing emphasis on National Education in schools.&nbsp; This will help our youth to develop what Mr Sin Boon Ann refers to as a strong sense of national identity, and re-affirm their commitment to Singapore.&nbsp; It is not easy but we must try.&nbsp; We must give them a sense of ownership and a chance to participate in school through National Education and outside of school through the programmes set up by MCYS, so that we give them the experience that they will remember<p align=left>Column: 3473<p> and reach deep down in their hearts, they can get that sense of&nbsp;identity that they are&nbsp;Singaporeans and&nbsp;they are for Singapore.&nbsp; Globalisation may take&nbsp;them all over the world, whether for work or&nbsp;studies, but we know that, if they have that influential experience&nbsp;and they remember that experience deep down in their hearts, ultimately, they would come back home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So MCYS&nbsp;wants to develop more&nbsp;spaces to cater to our young people.&nbsp; They provide a common space for them to congregate, share experiences and engage in constructive activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight our *scape project which is well publicised.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;a national youth community space under development in Orchard Road today.&nbsp; This project is conceived by our youth and they set the specifications for this space.&nbsp; They also&nbsp;voted for their favourite&nbsp;design, and there&nbsp;were about&nbsp;5,000 youth who cast their votes for 39 designs.&nbsp; The winning design was among the top three favourites chosen by them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very heartened by Mr Zaqy Mohamad's praise of *scape as an interesting city youth venue and note his call for similar developments in the heartlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is worth consideration, and I believe many of us would remember the days that we&nbsp;played at the void decks.&nbsp;&nbsp;I honed my soccer and table tennis skills&nbsp;at the void deck.&nbsp; Those were our spaces in the past.&nbsp; So we will be prepared to consider developing more facilities like&nbsp;*scape elsewhere but, first, we need to develop this *scape at Orchard Road and pick up the relevant lessons from that experience before we do an effective job at the community level.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are also developing an international standard Skatepark at East Coast Park.&nbsp; The concept design, which was developed with our local extreme sports gurus and enthusiasts, is now <p align=left>Column: 3474<p>ready.&nbsp; Members of the House who do inline skating, this will be&nbsp;the place for you.&nbsp; I know that&nbsp;Prof. Jayakumar is a great inline skater.&nbsp; I have told him and he is all excited, so I cannot wait to see him skate there.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Muhammad Faishal enquired about the trend of youth volunteerism and, in particular, about how the youth from 25 to 35 years have been engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre's (NVPC)&nbsp;&nbsp;biennial survey on volunteerism, the volunteerism rate for youth aged 15 to 24 years old has risen from 17% in 2002 to 28% in 2006. The volunteerism rate for older youth, however, does not show a clear trend, and this is the age group of 25 to 34 years old.&nbsp; It fluctuates within a range of 11% to 15% between 2002 and 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for the working youth in this group, NVPC still promotes&nbsp;volunteerism through corporate employee volunteering programmes, such as the new ComCare Connection initiative.&nbsp;This initiative matches corporations with suitable VWOs that help needy Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must bear in mind that their priorities lie with starting a family, raising their children and building their careers.&nbsp; But I assure you that my Ministry will look into engaging these young adults, because they are the heart of our nation, and we want to tailor the&nbsp;volunteering&nbsp;opportunities that would take into account their needs and priorities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we continue to engage volunteerism through our Youth Expedition&nbsp;Project, or YEP, or&nbsp;our Young ChangeMakers (YCM) programme. YEP is open to youth aged 15 to 35 years old and provides funding and advisory support for youth to volunteer overseas.&nbsp; About more than 11,000 youth have already <p align=left>Column: 3475<p>participated in YEP and the older youth volunteer in the programme&nbsp;in the capacity of&nbsp;team leaders, leading the younger youth in these overseas expeditions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; YEP also helps our young people to better appreciate what they have in Singapore when they are exposed to the harsher realities of life faced by the people they help overseas.&nbsp; This also contributes towards a stronger national identity, as mentioned by Mr Sin Boon Ann, as our youth now better understand the values that have contributed to our success as a country.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to have a more effective outreach and&nbsp;better programmes, it is necessary to have a 3P approach between the private, public and people sectors.&nbsp; Dr Maliki would be pleased to note that we will continue to build on these programmes based on these principles. We are working with private sector organisations to enhance our youth initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example is the Young ChangeMakers scheme, which gives out seed funding to youth to run local community projects, and it can be any projects;&nbsp;they come forward, we will support and fund them.&nbsp;I am&nbsp;pleased to announce that Nike Singapore has partnered with Young ChangeMakers to set up a grant to support sports-related youth community projects.&nbsp; So, any young person&nbsp;within the organisation or your area who would like to organise, say, a soccer game for the handicapped or the underprivileged children, or set up a clinic to teach a new sports, this programme will help fund it and help support them.&nbsp; More importantly, this taps on the strengths of the different sectors, creating a win-win partnership and a long-term engagement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki and Ms Ellen Lee also asked about our plans to reach out to at-risk<p align=left>Column: 3476<p> youth and out-of-school youth. We recognise that the work with at-risk youth and out-of-school youth cannot be undertaken by any one Ministry.&nbsp; It has to be inter-agency, inter-Ministry.&nbsp;The National Committee on Youth Guidance and Rehabilitation, or NYGR in short, coordinates these multi-agency efforts in this area. Working with the NYGR, MCYS adopts a three-fold approach.&nbsp; First, prevention and guidance. Second, detection and enforcement. Third, rehabilitation and restoration.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For students who are still in school, STEP-UP is a programme that funds VWOs to provide school social work services to students.&nbsp; It focuses on students at risk of dropping out or becoming potential delinquents.&nbsp; MCYS has increased the funding provided to STEP-UP and as of January 2007, the number of schools on STEP-UP has increased to 152, nearly 40% more than the 109 participating schools in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For out-of-school youth or OSY, Youth Link is&nbsp;a new scheme that provides support and outreach to them.&nbsp; MCYS works with the VWOs to provide guidance to these youth, and to ensure that they find meaningful engagement in employment, alternative education or skills training.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, staff from the VWOs would be invited to sit in the exit interviews before students&nbsp;formally leave the school, so as to facilitate proper follow-through for these students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides Youth Link, MCYS also funds the Learning Centre Programme which supports OSY by providing alternative education centres for out-of-school youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one such beneficiary is Farid.&nbsp; His difficult family circumstances caused him to lose interest in school, and he dropped out of school and ran into trouble with the law.&nbsp;He was finally placed in this Max Out Programme offered <p align=left>Column: 3477<p>by Yayasan MENDAKI.&nbsp; It is an OSY programme co-funded by MCYS.&nbsp; He started to ace his subjects and he passed his N-levels with good results and he is now sitting for his O-levels. These are inspiring stories that tell us that we must give these young people a second chance, so that they have a chance to succeed in their lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For youth&nbsp;who are completing their rehabilitation programme in the children's home or juvenile institutions, re-entering the community can be very daunting.&nbsp; Hence, Podz Youth Mentoring&nbsp; programme was started last November with four social service agencies. These agencies run a mentorship programme that begins during the youth's stay in the institutions and continues after that for up to six months after they have been discharged.&nbsp; By the end of this year, MCYS aims to have 300 youth attached to this programme and to the mentors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our system may be comprehensive in coverage but it is definitely not perfect. We will continue to work hard and work with the people and private sector to take in feedback from the practitioners on the ground. This will&nbsp;help us refine our programmes and help these at-risk youth to build a positive self-image and build a better future for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on sports.&nbsp; It is something close to my heart. Following the recommendations of the Committee on Sporting Singapore in 2001, chaired by Mr Speaker when he was the Minister, it led to a major infusion of resources into the local sports scene.&nbsp; So far, we have set up the Sports School,&nbsp;launched the Sports Hub project and there&nbsp;is enhancement to the support for&nbsp;athletes and&nbsp;NSAs. We have also developed a calendar of marquee events, investing in programmes to promote mass participation.&nbsp; According to our latest figures, <p align=left>Column: 3478<p>one in two Singaporeans participate in sports or exercise at least once a week.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the elite and international sports performance level, national athletes have done us proud.&nbsp; They won&nbsp;a record of 139 medals at the SEA Games (42 of those are golds),&nbsp;18 medals&nbsp;at the Commonwealth Games (five of them are golds), and,&nbsp;of course, you will know, 27 medals at the Asian Games (8 of them are gold medals).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we must continue to build on that and we will build on the&nbsp;foundation that has brought us both success in sports excellence, sports for all and glory for the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Michael Palmer that our efforts will also extend to the disabled athletes and the disabled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) currently provide support and funding to the Singapore Disability Sports Council, or SDSC in short,&nbsp;as the national agency that champions sports for all forms of disability, at both elite and recreational levels. He would be glad to note that the funding has increased for them.&nbsp; Disabled athletes can also tap on the current schemes in the Singapore Sports Council, such as Athletes Career and Training programme, or ACT in short, and&nbsp;the Programme for Elite Athletes Career (PEAC). Take, for example, our swimmer, Theresa Goh.&nbsp;&nbsp;She has been a beneficiary of ACT since 2004 and&nbsp;is now on PEAC where she is based at Standard Chartered Bank.&nbsp;She works and trains at the same time. And with a detailed plan that was mapped out by SDSC, with her coach, Mr Ang Peng Siong, Theresa, while she is working, is now training for the Beijing Paralympics in 2008.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the recreational level, the SDSC has also started a Learn-To-Play programme which will help to promote inclusiveness, tap on sports, even as a form of rehabilitation.&nbsp; Taking into account the recommendations in the Enabling<p align=left>Column: 3479<p> Masterplan, we will look into ways to strengthen SDSC's outreach and capabilities to spearhead disability sports.&nbsp;Mr Palmer will also&nbsp;be pleased to note the developments over at the Singapore Sports School.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;he&nbsp;has read the papers, it was featured that&nbsp;swimmer Khristine&nbsp;Quek enrolled to be its first disabled student in the Sports School.&nbsp; So the disabled and disabled athletes&nbsp;should get a chance to participate in sports and excel in them if they could. That will be our objective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sports School is also an ideal \"hothousing\" environment for integration of our foreign-born athletes, an issue raised by Mr Seah Kian Peng. When Tao Li, our Asian Games gold medalist, first joined the Sports School, she found it hard to communicate with her schoolmates, whether in Mandarin or English. After training, studying and living with her local peers for over a year -&nbsp;I personally&nbsp;spoke to her -&nbsp;whether for good or for bad, she learns Singlish.&nbsp;For that, I think she is totally entrenched into our local culture, and&nbsp;you cannot tell her apart from her peers now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We adopt three&nbsp;principles in foreign-born athletes policy -&nbsp;openness to global talent, fairness in treatment between local and foreign-born athletes, and integration into our way of life.&nbsp; The NSAs have a role to play to ensure that&nbsp;the integration plans are in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would include home-stays with locals, visits to cultural and historical sites, language classes and even learning how to sing our National Anthem.&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly,&nbsp;some NSAs have gone beyond to equip them with the life-skills, so as to prepare them for a career after sports. That could be coaching or administrative skills.&nbsp; I am sure Mrs Jessie Phua will agree with me on the logic behind providing this support to foreign-born athletes.&nbsp; Going forward, I will ask the Singapore Sports Council to play a more active role to help NSAs to manage this integration process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3480<p> I&nbsp;will now address Mr Ang Mong Seng's questions in Mandarin since he has asked them in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070309/20070309VS_163442.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ]&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng has earlier asked MCYS to consider whether or not it will allow more sports teams to train at the Sports School. The Sports School welcomes all National Sports Associations to attend training at the Sports School so that they can make full use of the wide range of facilities, including training venues, hostels and residential facilities, canteens and even supportive services such as sports science and sports medicine, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As pointed out by Mr Ang, this is a lot more cost-effective and, at the same time, students at the Sports School can compete against national athletes, and thus competency standards can be raised. On a national level, this is a win-win situation for both the National Sports Associations and the Singapore Sports School.&nbsp; Moving forward, the Singapore Sports School will cooperate with more foreign sports associations and encourage them to come for training at our Sports School. In this regard, I hope that&nbsp;advisers and leaders&nbsp;from various sports associations can work hand in hand with the Sports School.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I am relieved to hear that Mr Ang is looking forward to see our athletes achieve better results, and move up the ranks, just like pop songs moving up the music chart.&nbsp; However, this is not a pop song.&nbsp; Of course, I also hope that our sports performance will move up in rank, just like Stephanie Sun's songs slowly moving to the top of the chart.&nbsp; However, this may require years in training and managing but, nonetheless, we will work hard towards this goal.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

As for resources for NSAs,&nbsp;last week, Mrs Jessie Phua commented that sports appeared to have been sidelined from this year's Budget package.&nbsp; I would like to reassure her that my Ministry and SSC will continue to fully support the sports sector, particularly the NSAs.&nbsp; In fact, direct grants for NSAs have gone up from $31.1 million&nbsp;for FY2006 to $31.9 million for&nbsp;FY2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like Mrs Phua's idea of introducing a Sports Marketing group because you build on the Sports Business network.&nbsp; I believe SSC can facilitate this process where NSAs&nbsp;would have a chance to&nbsp;work on a strategy with the private sector to secure more sponsorship dollars.&nbsp; This is one way in which&nbsp;we can strengthen&nbsp;our value add to the NSAs and help them develop some level of self-sustainability.&nbsp; With all working hand in hand, there would be better opportunity, so that it would not be just a banker giving out grants but&nbsp;a&nbsp;facilitator&nbsp;- someone who goes out there to&nbsp;help the community&nbsp;to come&nbsp;together.&nbsp;And that should address some of Ms Jessica Tan's concerns about the lack of funds and sponsorship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Jessie Phua has also expressed some concern about whether sports can enjoy tax incentives.&nbsp; Currently, any group<p align=left>Column: 3482<p> or association that is not operating for profit and is engaged in the promotion of sports can apply for the Institution of a Public Character (IPC) status.&nbsp; This would include the NSAs.&nbsp; This incentivises the public and corporations to donate to sports causes, as the donors can obtain double tax deductions for their donations.&nbsp; To date, a total of 27 NSAs and 10 other sports groups have been accorded IPC status.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For institutions to register as charities, they must be set up to benefit the community.&nbsp; As Mrs Phua rightly pointed out, these would include Sports for All activities.&nbsp; My Ministry acknowledges her point that all three pillars&nbsp;- Sports for All, Sports Excellence and Sports Industry - are interlinked and mutually reinforcing.&nbsp; We are in discussions with other relevant agencies on whether we can collectively recognise&nbsp;these other&nbsp;sporting limbs for charitable purposes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Jessie Phua also talked about the financial strain on NSAs having to pay for their land leases.&nbsp; The Singapore Land Authority currently leases land directly to SSC at sports and recreation rates, which are generally lower than commercial rates.&nbsp; SSC, in turn, leases the land to NSAs at subsidised rates as part of its overall outcome-based approach to support NSAs.&nbsp; Mrs Phua has used the analogy,&nbsp;\"left pocket, right pocket\"&nbsp;to describe this arrangement.&nbsp; The principle behind this is to instil discipline on land usage.&nbsp; Regarding her suggestion on providing incentives to encourage the private sector to provide sports facilities, we will study it with other relevant agencies, and we will see how this can be done in a manner without distorting the market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS recently set up a Sporting Culture Committee involving members from the people, private and public sectors.&nbsp; I thank Ms Jessica Tan for her passion about sports, as she moved her<p align=left>Column: 3483<p> cut yesterday.&nbsp; She will be pleased to note that the Committee will look at sports from the \"culture\" angle,&nbsp;ie, injecting a strong sporting identity into our people so that we can all live and breathe sports.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has met several times and consulted the sporting fraternity.&nbsp; Many key ideas and recommendations came up.&nbsp; One key idea is to provide more opportunities for each child to learn a few sporting skills in school life and make sports a life-long pursuit. Currently, through MOE's Physical Education (PE) Curriculum, and a good example that was brought up&nbsp;of Sengkang Primary having PE everyday, all students acquire the knowledge and skills to play a variety of games from primary to pre-university levels.&nbsp; We will continue to build on this by working with MOE to roll out the Sports Education Programme (SEP) to the schools, whereby students would have opportunities to try out more sports,&nbsp;even at the non-competitive level.&nbsp; So even if&nbsp;they cannot represent&nbsp;their school at competition level,&nbsp;we must&nbsp;allow&nbsp;them&nbsp;the chance to play any sports in school and continue with that passion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has also highlighted the need to remove physical barriers or obstacles that may discourage participation.&nbsp; To address this point, we will be ramping up our efforts to improve the accessibility to sports facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are&nbsp;50 school fields opened up for booking by members of the public.&nbsp; By the end of this year, we will open up another 70 fields making a total of 120 schools open for the public.&nbsp; I urge all advisors here to talk to the schools in&nbsp;their area to also open up&nbsp;the fields&nbsp;for their community and enrol in this programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many good recommendations came up, eg, to have regional integrated sports hubs all around Singapore, and not just at Kallang.&nbsp; I think the details would need to be worked out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3484<p> The Committee will also look to provide enhanced support for top-tier athletes.&nbsp; One area of focus is Sports Medicine and Sports Science (SMSS).&nbsp; SSC recently announced its collaboration with the Changi General Hospital, to integrate their SMSS services.&nbsp; This is just a first step towards a more ambitious effort to develop a national network of strategic partners between the tertiary institutions, foreign universities, research outfits and private providers.&nbsp; The aim is to position Singapore as the SMSS hub for the region, catering to elite athletes or even weekend warriors like many of us.&nbsp; It is important to note that this sector would help bring sports performance to the next level.&nbsp; Because, as&nbsp;Members can see, many athletes of Asian countries are also&nbsp;not restricted by their physique and win at international and Olympic levels, and sports science is the way to go.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The work of the Committee is still ongoing and we are working towards completing the final report by the middle of the year.&nbsp; Just this week, I met several guests from Finland.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Finland, they have a population of 5.3 million, but they have&nbsp;7,800 sports clubs.&nbsp; We have a population of 4 million, but we have nearly&nbsp;1,000 sports clubs.&nbsp; I hope the work of the Committee will bring us closer to the vibrant sports scene like in Finland.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In parallel with our sports participation and excellence thrusts, we are now developing our sports industry.&nbsp; As part of our manpower development plans, we have rolled out a new Undergraduate Sports Scholarship Programme.&nbsp; We target to award&nbsp;two overseas and&nbsp;two local undergraduate scholarships each year.&nbsp; Tenable for studies in sports-related and other disciplines, these scholarships will raise the profile of sports-related careers or sportsmen who can be effective and can be leaders in any field, and also&nbsp;help to attract top-tier talent into&nbsp;management&nbsp;and leadership careers within the Ministries or agencies.&nbsp; I hope to see major <p align=left>Column: 3485<p>companies&nbsp; - sports or non-sports related&nbsp; -&nbsp; to come forward&nbsp;and co-sponsor the scholarships with SSC.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have ambitious aspirations for our youth and for sports in Singapore.&nbsp; We want to enable our youth to be self-reliant and that, in tough times, they would be resilient, independent and have the strength to face the challenges.&nbsp; They must have a sense of belonging and identity to contribute to Singapore.&nbsp; For sports, we need to have a sporting culture that would build a healthy and active society, create a chance for the talented to achieve the highest sporting glory and bond the nation together.&nbsp; This is borne not just from a desire to have our young people and a strong sporting culture bring life and dynamism to Singapore.&nbsp; This is also anchored in the belief that, as Singaporeans, we can achieve something beyond the familiar.&nbsp; We can overcome the challenges, we dare to take risks and we would never give up and always be the best that we can be.&nbsp; My Ministry and all our partners will continue to work alongside our people for a brighter and more exciting future that is built on the full potential of all Singaporeans.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chan Soo Sen (Joo Chiat)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

If they were to get too carried away, they risk losing everything plus their family and the community who are supporting them.&nbsp; What steps have been or will be taken to educate our people on the ill effects of gambling, and to ensure that they do not start in this road of no return?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to know whether programmes and schemes will be initiated to develop our capabilities in counselling the gamblers as well as their family members, together with the kind of support that we could offer to them in order to kick this bad habit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I understand, for example, that drug is a kind of vice.&nbsp; And we know that there are private armies that help to protect drug activities.&nbsp; But I am also told that in some of these more disciplined private armies, any of the members found to be consuming drugs may be shot.&nbsp; They know very clearly that these are the things for them to make money, but these are also the kinds of thing that can consume them.&nbsp; As a nation, it is vital that our people be educated that, while these IRs will bring us much economic benefits, we must arm and protect ourselves against all its ill effects.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

is a good first step in creating a closer network among the various faiths and races.&nbsp; More should be done to enhance the understanding particularly among youths who are exposed to radicalism due to our status as a people, trade and information hub.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The step in involving community and religious leaders in the IRCC is welcomed but the first assumption we make is that the message to be made known and racial understanding that we want to promote will flow down to the ground.&nbsp; The second assumption is that the openness and respect that happen at the leadership level reflect the same attitudes on the ground.&nbsp; Both these assumptions are not always true.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to pose a number of questions to MCYS.&nbsp; In the Ministry's point of view, what are the effects on the social fabric of Singapore brought by the trends of fundamentalism and radicalism from the Middle East?&nbsp; Are these trends affecting the general society's view of the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore?&nbsp; For example, the issue on choice of employees. Secondly, what is the effect of increased religiosity among youths on the approach taken by the Ministry to enhance racial integration through IRCC and CEP?&nbsp; And what are the Ministry's efforts to reach out to these youths more effectively?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to inculcate tolerance and respect in our multi-racial and multi-<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3637-3638.<BR></div></P></div><p align=left>Column: 3489<p>religious society, MCYS also should step up its efforts in several areas. For example, I hope that MCYS can also provide the community with platforms that they can refer to in order to seek clarification and understanding while having meaningful debates and comparing various ideologies with various religious and racial organisations in Singapore. In doing so, we can create a more open and tolerant environment, and not one that totally relies on approaches such as censorship or avoidance from facing these issues.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Sir, I thank Mr Chan Soo Sen for his most eloquent warning about the dangers of&nbsp;problem gambling.&nbsp; As the person who was responsible for leading the MTI team that evaluated the economic benefits of having IRs and then also being in MCYS at that time&nbsp;when we made the final decision,&nbsp;I can assure him&nbsp;that no one was more painfully aware than I was of the trade-offs and the dilemmas that confronted us in this decision.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem gambling is an ever present threat.&nbsp; It is a threat&nbsp;today even before the IRs have arrived.&nbsp; We formed the National Council on Problem Gambling and&nbsp;over the last two years of its existence, it has actually engaged on an aggressive public education campaign to warn people about the dangers of gambling.&nbsp; I fully agree with&nbsp;him and, also, the comments that&nbsp;were made by Mr Christopher de Souza during the Budget debate that we need both prevention and treatment.&nbsp; We need to warn&nbsp;and treat people.&nbsp; So we will go about this in the following way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, at the community level. On the ground, we must make sure that our social service professionals are able to recognise people at risk, recognise the <p align=left>Column: 3490<p>warning signs and refer them.&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for our social workers to be able to make this preliminary diagnosis, they need training.&nbsp;&nbsp;MCYS&nbsp;has embarked on a training programme together with the Institute of Mental Health which runs programmes call the Community Addictions Management Programme.&nbsp; And this will give our social service workers on the frontline the ability to diagnose and recognise early danger signs and then make appropriate referral.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we also want to have treatment facilities in the community.&nbsp; So, in September last year, we appointed two VWOs -&nbsp;the Thye Hwa Kwan Moral Society and the Care Corner Counselling Centre - to run specialised intervention centres.&nbsp; These will have professionals who are specially trained in the management of addiction and it will handle cases which are referred by other family service centres as well as cases which are referred back to the community by the Institute of Mental Health, ie,&nbsp;cases which are now more stabilised but still require ongoing supervision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third level, of course, is at the Institute of Mental Health under the Community Addictions Management Programme and this will be specialist care for people with real problems and who are unable to control their gambling addiction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on to the points made by Mr Zaqy Mohamad and Mr Zainudin Nordin and, I think, Mdm Cynthia Phua also spoke about it during the Budget debate, and that is the state of our race relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our success in maintaining a harmonious and cohesive society speaks for itself.&nbsp; Let us celebrate the fact that despite local incidents, for instance, the arrest of local JI operatives, and despite&nbsp;overseas incidents, such as September 11,&nbsp;Bali bombing,&nbsp;London bombing, the Danish cartoons,&nbsp;we have been able to<p align=left>Column: 3491<p> maintain cohesion and unity in our society.&nbsp; We have not let these events serve to divide and break us apart.&nbsp; That is something worth celebrating but not taken for granted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We conducted a survey last year on the social attitudes of Singaporeans and I am glad to report to this House that about&nbsp;nine in 10 Singaporeans reported that they were satisfied with the current state of race and religious relationships in Singapore and were optimistic about the future.&nbsp; Again, as I said, positive but do not take it for granted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must continue to build on the strong foundation. And we have moved on with&nbsp;what we call the Community Engagement Programme, and&nbsp;Members asked me what is&nbsp;different.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we were focused more on persuading people and raising awareness of the need for racial harmony and understanding.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;now moved on&nbsp;to the second phase to actually put in place a crisis response framework,&nbsp;which means we want the religious and community leaders to know what to do or what to say the morning thereafter.&nbsp; This involves a greater level of interaction of training and&nbsp;development of trust and confidence.&nbsp; That is why we have also asked that&nbsp;the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs) be reconstituted so that at the local level, every religious or community leader that matters is represented in the IRCC.&nbsp; It is not meant to be just&nbsp;another collection of the grassroots leaders who are already overworked, to begin with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS will also be providing a grant of $10,000&nbsp;to each IRCC and also&nbsp;secretariat assistance&nbsp;so that IRCC can get on with its business of building trust and interaction without being bogged down by administration or&nbsp;a lack of funds.&nbsp; It is also crucial, as Mr Zaqy has pointed out, that our young people understand the importance of racial and religious harmony, and I agree with&nbsp;him that<p align=left>Column: 3492<p> schools, but more important&nbsp;families, have a crucial role to play in this.&nbsp; You know there are in the&nbsp;lives of our young people \"teachable moments\", and parents and teachers have to look for these teachable moments when the young are most receptive to the messages that reinforce racial harmony and religious understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will also work with our community partners to promote greater interaction amongst youth and one platform we have&nbsp;come up recently is the Singapore Inter-Faith Youth Forum.&nbsp; And this came about because some young people who were taking part in the National Youth Forum&nbsp;decided that it was important that the young -&nbsp;these are young religious leaders - have their own forum which they could share experiences and seek greater understanding.&nbsp; So the fact that these platforms are rising from the young is, I think, a very&nbsp;positive sign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me end by sharing some views on this issue of advertisements -&nbsp;job advertisements and sometimes even housing advertisements - which overtly mention race.&nbsp; Let me speak in my dual capacity as Minister for MCYS and Second Minister for MICA.&nbsp; I know that all of us have personal private biases, sometimes even prejudice.&nbsp; I also know that we cannot eliminate all vestiges of racial prejudice and discrimination overnight.&nbsp; But having said that, we must not allow prejudice to become publicly and socially acceptable.&nbsp; We must not have young people standing up and saying, \"I am a racist and I am proud about it.\".&nbsp; We must not have such a situation and that is why we must ask the mass media and advertising industry to root out and eliminate such advertisements.&nbsp; We must actively resist overt displays of racial stereotyping and prejudice because if we do not do so, we will destroy the social fabric and&nbsp;social unity on which peace, harmony and progress of our nation depends on.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 3493<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Muslim Affairs</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)</B> (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070309/20070309VS_112111.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I>]&nbsp;Mr Chairman, we have heard from MOF and MOM that our economic progress will further improve and 450,000 jobs will be made available within this five-year period.&nbsp; Our society will have to be prepared to face a globalised future which is more competitive and makes use of the opportunities provided by the Government.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our society has made substantial progress in education and employment, but I am worried that there is still a section in our society who finds it hard to adapt themselves to the changes that we are experiencing and they will be left far behind.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also face social problems like divorce, drug abuse and dropouts from school.&nbsp; Many also do not have the skill to perform high-value jobs which pay better to provide for their families and, more often, they experience unemployment.&nbsp; The WIS scheme will help and motivate this group.

Rather than giving direct handouts, MUIS has been working with community organisations and other service providers to empower and build self-reliance among the recipients.&nbsp;This is similar to the philosophy behind the Workfare Income Supplement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUIS' Empowerment Partnership Scheme, or EPS, started in 2004 complements national schemes available to all needy Singaporeans and helps ensure that the needs of families are holistically addressed.&nbsp; Allow me to give&nbsp;an example.&nbsp; 40-year old Mdm Suzana and husband - with three children and an elderly mother to care for&nbsp;- first got into the EPS when they&nbsp;ran into financial difficulties. She picked up business skills from the self-employment assistance programme offered by the CDC. By putting together her cooking talent and the new business skills,&nbsp;she managed to grow her $700 monthly household income three-fold.&nbsp; I commend Mdm Suzana's self-reliance, determination and success in uplifting her family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving forward, to better support such families, MUIS will be investing up to $1.2 million over the next two years on selected programmes run by&nbsp; community organisations with&nbsp;a good track record.&nbsp; MUIS, Sir, will also be developing a blueprint to see how <I>zakat</I> can be used to complement the national help schemes, and to better help the low-income families within the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the Employability Network of the Community Leaders Forum, there are a number of other economic empowerment programmes that have provided employment opportunities.&nbsp; In fact, Mdm Halimah herself had already announced three such initiatives - <I>Suri Stitch, Suri Salon,</I> and <I>Suri Spa</I> - which are all social enterprise projects funded by the&nbsp;ComCare Enterprise Fund.&nbsp; These projects will help&nbsp;more of our womenfolk <p align=left>Column: 3499<p>to be economically active, including single mothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge more in our community to take advantage of the many programmes available to upgrade themselves and to enhance their family's financial well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address Dr Fatimah's concern on high Muslim divorces and the measures taken to strengthen Malay families.&nbsp; To address the issues upstream, the issues of teenage sexuality and marriages, involving minors,&nbsp;the NURteensLine and the NUR Drop-In Centres, projects funded by the ComCare Social Support Projects Fund, were introduced in December 2005.&nbsp;Since then, the NURteensLine has received more than 1,000 calls and SMSes.&nbsp;A third of the calls received centred on sexuality issues and parent-teen relationship.&nbsp; Sir, I am happy to announce that two new Drop-In Centres have been set up this year, one in Bukit Batok and the other one in Yishun, bringing the total number of NUR Centres to five for the Malay/Muslim community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the last two years, MCYS and MediaCorp's <I>Suria</I> have worked together to promote awareness within the community on teenage issues.&nbsp; <I>SEKSa</I> - a series which coaches parents on how to bond and broach sensitive topics with their children -&nbsp;follows on&nbsp;the runaway success of another programme, <I>Hanyut,</I> which through the various efforts, reached out to 600,000 people.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;told that <I>SEKS</I><I>a</I> is currently&nbsp;the top info-ed programme on <I>Suria</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other community initiatives have similarly attracted wide attention and support. The month-long <I>Lebih Sexy Katakan \"Tidak!\"</I>(or in English, It is Sexier&nbsp;to say No!) initiative has since reached out to more than 400,000 people from all walks of life.&nbsp;<I>Keluarga AKRAB -</I> a movement of Family Excellence Circles, or FEC, introduced in 2005 to strengthen families - has now&nbsp;grown to involve more than 300 parents.&nbsp; More&nbsp;FECs have<p align=left>Column: 3500<p> been formed with more partners coming on board.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are also focused on helping those who intend to or have just started&nbsp;out on marriage life.&nbsp; A premarital counselling programme piloted for minor couples is showing heartening results.&nbsp; 17% of 333 couples who&nbsp;underwent counselling decided not to proceed with marriage for the time&nbsp;being.&nbsp; I am sure this is good news for Dr Fatimah.&nbsp; For those who decide to proceed,&nbsp;PPIS-Jurong FSC and AMP will be managing two centres dedicated to support them through their marriage.&nbsp;We want to make sure that the marriage lasts.&nbsp; These centres will be operational in the&nbsp;second&nbsp;quarter of this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, such efforts are starting to deliver some results.&nbsp; Preliminary figures from the Registry of Muslim Marriages show that there has been a 25% drop in the number of minor Muslim brides and grooms over the past two years.&nbsp;Between 2004 and 2006, the number of minor brides dropped from 564 to 506 to 422, while the number of grooms dropped from 159 to 140 to 118.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our community and leaders have come together to make this happen.&nbsp; However, marriages involving minors are twice as likely to end up in divorce when compared to other marriages.&nbsp; Thus, while we should continue extending our support to the married minors in our community, we need to have a long-term approach to prevent such issues from getting acute and entrenched.&nbsp;&nbsp;One measure, which Dr Fatimah has raised, that we are studying is raising the minimum age of marriage under the Administration of Muslim Law Act, or AMLA.&nbsp; This is currently set at 16 for the bride and groom, lower than the minimum age under the Women's Charter which is 18.&nbsp; We will be studying this further with the community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to the issue of religious development raised aptly by  <p align=left>Column: 3501<p>Mr Hawazi, which is central to the well-being of the community.&nbsp; MUIS, together with its partners and stakeholders, has helped to ensure the practice of Islam in Singapore remains progressive, confident and compatible with our multi-racial and multi-religious context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <I>asatizah,</I> or religious clerics, play a key role.&nbsp; And here, I thank our senior <I>asatizah</I> for their selfless contributions to the work of the Religious Rehabilitation Group, or RRG, and going further to organise public forums and dialogues to dispel misconceptions, thereby strengthening Islam further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>Asatizah</I> Recognition Scheme, as raised by Mr Hawazi, introduced last year through the efforts of MUIS working hand-in-hand with Pergas, has received positive feedback and acceptance from the <I>asatizah</I> and the community.&nbsp; To date, about 700 have registered through the scheme.&nbsp; The religious teachers' directory has become a trustworthy reference that also safeguards against any fake preacher pushing&nbsp;self-serving beliefs.&nbsp; Recognising the important role of <I>asatizah,</I> I am pleased to announce that a full-time structured leadership development programme will be made available for our <I>asatizah</I> to enhance their leadership capabilities.&nbsp; Such courses can provide <I>asatizah</I> with deeper insight into the principles that govern Singapore and enhance the ability to make a greater contribution to society.&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Ustaz</I> Murat Aris,&nbsp;a MUIS officer, recently attended a month long Governance and Leadership Course organised by the Institute of Policy Development.&nbsp; I am hopeful that more of our <I>asatizah</I> will be able to participate in such programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hawazi also raised the question of informal teachers.&nbsp; Sir, MUIS will endeavour to bring them into the scheme as quickly as possible and, where necessary,<p align=left>Column: 3502<p> will advise them on how their skills&nbsp;can be upgraded so they can become part&nbsp;of the scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now turn to the issue of <I>madrasahs,</I> raised by Dr Maliki, and the question that Mdm Halimah wanted to ask. Our <I>madrasahs</I> are expected to meet the PSLE requirement in 2008.&nbsp; The <I>madrasahs</I> and MUIS have been working closely to ensure that <I>madrasah</I> students are prepared for PSLE.&nbsp; They have concentrated their resources and efforts in three key areas: teacher development, curriculum review and student development.&nbsp; To date, MUIS has spent $7.6 million to strengthen the capacity&nbsp;of <I>madrasahs</I> in these three areas.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a structured training programme has been put in place to ensure that all <I>madrasah</I> teachers are formally certified.&nbsp; MUIS will commit a total of $1.3 million to ensure that all <I>madrasah</I> teachers obtain at least a Diploma in Education.&nbsp; I am heartened to note that our <I>madrasah</I> teachers are committed towards continuous training, taking up courses offered by both local and foreign institutions.&nbsp; I commend our <I>madrasahs,</I> both the management and the teachers, for their dedication and efforts to keep abreast of the latest pedagogical skills and technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our <I>madrasahs</I> have significantly increased the contact time for English, Mathematics and Science (EMS) to match the exposure time that these subjects get in Government schools. &nbsp;MUIS has spent $5.9 million to revise the curriculum for Islamic studies and Arabic language for Primary 1 to Secondary 4. With the revised curriculum, our <I>madrasah</I> students can continue to get a strong foundation in their religious curriculum, while receiving the increased exposure to English, Mathematics and Science.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3503<p>Student development is another important area which the <I>madrasahs</I> and MUIS have been focusing on.&nbsp; To better support their students, the <I>madrasahs</I> have worked with private operators and Mendaki to provide good learning support programmes.&nbsp; To date, 369 pupils from five <I>madrasahs</I> have benefited from the M-Power (Mathematics) Programme organised by Mendaki.&nbsp; MUIS is also working to allow each <I>madrasah</I> student to receive a student grant that can be used to pay for enrichment programmes that would expose him or her to a wider range of&nbsp;opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has asked whether the <I>madrasahs</I> are ready for the PSLE.&nbsp; We are confident that with the support that we have given,&nbsp;our <I>madrasahs</I> will be able to face the challenges of the PSLE.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that, as agreed during the debate on the compulsory education, the 400 students who are exempted from the <I>madrasahs</I> will remain and for those <I>madrasahs</I> that cannot meet the PSLE standards, MUIS will continue to provide assistance to ensure that their secondary and post-secondary curriculum continue to be updated and improved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, <I>madrasahs</I> are important institutions for developing our religious elite.&nbsp; We want to see our <I>madrasah</I> students succeed in both their religious and academic studies so that they have as many options available as possible for further studies and their future careers. &nbsp;So we must make it a target for us in our community that all of the students pass the PSLE benchmark.&nbsp; As such, considerable resources have been channelled by MUIS and the community to the <I>madrasahs</I>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Maliki has also asked about the revamp of part-time religious education.&nbsp; The needs of the vast majority of the Muslim students who attend or have attended national schools are indeed a priority.&nbsp; MUIS has expanded the range of<p align=left>Column: 3504<p> the age-specific part-time religious education programmes to include the youths&nbsp;as well as tweens; those just before becoming teenagers.&nbsp; The response to the part-time religious education programme has been positive.&nbsp; So far, about 26,000 students are attending the part-time religious education classes in our mosques, and this figure does not include those who are following other part-time religious education classes offered by other organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just cite one&nbsp;example on the effectiveness of the programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Siti Hairani Aznor, a young working adult who had signed up for the two-month YouthAlive primer course said that she now has a better appreciation of the contributions of Muslims in various fields over the centuries. &nbsp;I am happy to report that there will now be more of such learning opportunities for more youths as the part-time religious education syllabus is expected to be rolled out in all our mosque religious classes or part-time <I>madrasahs</I> by 2010.&nbsp; MUIS has also started a new annual programme called the Shared Perspectives Seminar, which is targeted at youths, and will prompt discussion on issues relevant to our faith and the role and place it occupies in the current times.&nbsp; This is a point that was raised by Mr Zaqy&nbsp;Mohd.&nbsp; The first seminar will be held next week.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, finally, on the issue of community engagement raised by Mr Zainudin Nordin who wants to know about&nbsp;our efforts. Singapore, as we all know,&nbsp;is a multi-racial and multi-religious country.&nbsp; Muslims must remain open, appreciate the faiths of fellow Singaporeans and also help them to understand Islam.&nbsp; This will help Singapore stay strong, vibrant, united and resilient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the local level, Muslims have participated in many inter-faith and inter-ethnic initiatives.&nbsp; MUIS and the mosques have been actively involved in the<p align=left>Column: 3505<p> National Steering Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony chaired by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, and the newly-repositioned Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCCs).&nbsp; The Harmony Centre, launched by our Prime Minister just five months ago, has already received more than 2,300 visitors and many warm reviews from people of all faiths.&nbsp; To better promote its message of peace and inter-faith understanding, the Harmony Centre will be launching its own website in the second half of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the international level, MUIS Academy recently inked an agreement with Hartford Seminary, a premier institution from Connecticut that is well-known for its research into Muslim-Christian links. Through this link-up, MUIS will be organising inter-faith seminars and courses for people of all religions.&nbsp; MUIS also launched the Distinguished Visitors Programme last May and welcomed His Eminence Dr Sayyed Muhammad Tantawi of Al-Azhar as our first distinguished visitor.&nbsp; MUIS will continue to invite more eminent speakers, both Muslim and non-Muslim, to share their insights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Muslim community is confident and forward looking.&nbsp; We have&nbsp;steadily been putting in place a solid base&nbsp;- empowering individuals, connecting with our youths, strengthening families, and enhancing the progressive practice of Islam.&nbsp; Our model has been studied, recognised and commended by many international authorities and observers.&nbsp; Our <I>haj</I> and <I>halal</I> certification services are sought after by many other countries, and we have even shared our <I>madrasah</I> curriculum with them.&nbsp; A UK group of Muslim parliamentarians and community leaders visited us last July and were impressed by how Muslims here integrated and contributed to&nbsp;the wider society. &nbsp;Indeed, the Executive Director of the Islamic Society of North America, Dr<p align=left>Column: 3506<p> Louay Safi, felt that Singapore can be a model for places where Muslims are a minority.&nbsp; So while we recognise the issues that concern us, we should be proud of what we have achieved.&nbsp; Let us work even harder to achieve our vision of being a community of excellence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now, Sir, to sum up in Malay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>&nbsp; (In Malay)</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070309/20070309VS_101805.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ]&nbsp;The Malay-Muslim community in Singapore has shown strong determination and has&nbsp;achieved very encouraging results.&nbsp; We are on the right track in determining our future direction and in&nbsp;tackling social issues and the challenges of&nbsp;a globalised world.&nbsp; Our religious life is&nbsp;dynamic and progressive.&nbsp; Our objective is to achieve a better standard of living for our community in line with our vision of being a community of excellence and a community that is active in bringing well-being and prosperity to our country.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take the opportunity to express my thanks to community leaders, <I>asatizahs</I> and Malay-Muslim organisations for their active participation in efforts to move the community forward.&nbsp; As the proverb says, \"<I>berat sama dipikul</I>, <I>ringan sama dijinjing</I> \" we work together no matter what the challenges are.&nbsp; With the sense of unity in purpose and a common goal, I am sure we can overcome the challenges that we are facing now and will face in the future.&nbsp; Although sometimes we do not achieve consensus in some matters, it is important that we should not allow this to affect&nbsp;our main objective of bringing progress to our community together.&nbsp; For this purpose, it is important that we&nbsp;put aside whatever personal or group interests that we may have in the interest of the community.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Community Leaders' Forum has now been a platform for discussions and this is in line with our culture and religion.<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3649-3650.<BR></div></P></div>&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3507<p> This will continue to be our thrust of practice and achieving consensus.&nbsp; We must practise the principle of consensus among our community.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman</B>:&nbsp; We have some time for clarifications.&nbsp; Can I request that we take the clarifications for Minister Yaacob first before we move on to the rest?&nbsp; There will be time for every one else.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B> (<I>In Malay</I> ):&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions.&nbsp; Firstly, is the sum of&nbsp;$1.2 million sufficient to assist the less fortunate families?&nbsp; Secondly, how&nbsp;many such families have been assisted under the MUIS fund?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

As I said yesterday, frankly, one limiting factor must be&nbsp;that the sum that<p align=left>Column: 3512<p> we give through Public Assistance cannot be so generous as to erode the work ethic.&nbsp; As I said again yesterday, if you take a family with three children, the amount they can receive from Public Assistance - I do not have the exact figure now -&nbsp;I think&nbsp;exceeds $900. At that level, you are getting dangerously close to the earnings of a low-wage worker.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I think there will always be unique circumstances when some families find that that sum is not enough.&nbsp; And that is where the community and grassroots organisations have to come in and look for those mitigating or exceptional circumstances and more help is necessary.

Yes, we do want them to go and ask for help.&nbsp; But I also said yesterday that, let us not get too carried away and reach a stage where if someone does not know or does not want to ask for help, we ignore that person.&nbsp; I have also asked the community organisations, neighbours, voluntary welfare organisations and the rest of us, if&nbsp;we see someone who needs more help, enquire about that person and&nbsp;organise the help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us talk about meals since the Member has phrased her question specifically about three square meals.&nbsp; You and I, in fact, all of us, know that there are programmes for meals at home.&nbsp; There are organisations which specifically bring bread and&nbsp;rations,&nbsp;many of which are bought from FairPrice, gratitude to Mr Seah as well.&nbsp; But there are schemes like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;That allows me to say with a clear conscience to both the PAP and the <p align=left>Column: 3514<p>Opposition MPs that nobody in Singapore needs to starve, nobody needs to be deprived of healthcare, and nobody needs to be deprived of a roof over his or her head.&nbsp; If someone indeed is so destitute and is starving,&nbsp;we have other means and other safety nets for them.&nbsp;We can bring them to&nbsp;the Pelangi Home, and&nbsp;I would invite all of you to come to Pelangi Home&nbsp;and see the standard of care, the facilities, the food and the way we look after them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, please do not run away with the misconception that Singapore is a cold, heartless place where, because we&nbsp;are so strict on criteria and entitlements, people are starving, freezing and denied the dignities of life.&nbsp; All I am asking&nbsp;Members is just to bear these principles in mind.&nbsp; Entitlements will always be low, ie, the person has to ask you for help and not bang on your table for help. We will always need the many- helping-hands model, not because the Government is broke.&nbsp; We can always do more and we can always raise GST further. But that is not the tone of the society that we are trying to create. We are saying that, yes, there will always be problems in society and it cannot be only the Government to do it because, if you want the Government to do it all, it means higher taxes and a large bureaucracy.&nbsp; As we can see in many other countries who have created elaborate welfare-states based on the best of intentions and the softest of hearts, such systems ultimately failed, they are&nbsp;not efficient and&nbsp;they are going to run out of money.

Surely, the Minister would also, in his deliberations, consider whether or not the communication channel or the outreach channel is adequate and could the Ministry&nbsp;be doing more in this regard to reach out to these needy Singaporeans.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Absolutely.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shared the story of Tan Sai Siong yesterday to&nbsp;make the point that&nbsp;it just needs sometimes one email or one phone call. Singapore is a very small place.&nbsp; It is not difficult for&nbsp;Members to contact the Prime Minister or myself directly.&nbsp; I am not saying that that should be the <I>modus operandi</I> here and everything should be solved that way.&nbsp; But what I am saying is that, if you do detect families&nbsp;in such distress, do something about it. Do not just complain but ask yourself first what you should do about it and&nbsp; who else can help. As far as the Government is concerned, what systems, structures, institutions and policies&nbsp;are needed.&nbsp; I want to get these things clear in our minds that there is a role for the individual to help himself or to seek help.&nbsp; There is a role for families. There is a role for community organisations. There is a role for interested and compassionate individuals&nbsp;and Tan Sai Siong was an example. And&nbsp;there is a role for Government.&nbsp; But let us keep all these respective roles organised in such a way that each one does what he or she is best at.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I am appealing for understanding that our entitlement system will be low. That also&nbsp;means,&nbsp;as the Member has quite rightly said, we need to communicate, we need to keep all channels of communication open and we<p align=left>Column: 3516<p> need to keep our eyes open.&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot, like what I said yesterday, whenever you see someone whom you think needs help, just shrug our shoulders and say, \"See, that is the Government's job.\"&nbsp; Ask yourself what you yourself have done about that individual and about that family. Singapore has got to where it is now, not just because of hard work but also because there have been family obligations and community compassion. And we have been&nbsp;almost&nbsp;schizophrenic in the&nbsp;sense that I believe that we have done better than communist and socialist countries in looking after the poor.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

SDSC spearheads all disabled athletes of different levels of disabilities, whether it is intellectual or physical.&nbsp; Within the<p align=left>Column: 3518<p> intellectual disabilities, the Olympics for them is called Special Olympics, to include all disabilities and to encourage participation.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the elite level disabled athletes, they are called the Paralympics, and that would also be included if we are going to focus on Olympic glory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already started Project 0812,&nbsp;and the ball is rolling.&nbsp;We have been in discussion with different stakeholders on how we could include the disabled athletes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have set up the Sporting Culture Committee, as Members know.&nbsp; One of the sub-groups is called Glory for the Nation.&nbsp; Glory for the Nation helps athletes to achieve higher sporting glory, and that includes the Olympics.&nbsp; Project 0812, for the long term, will be roped into Glory for the Nation taskforce or committee.&nbsp; And we intend to include the disabled athletes under this banner, which is Glory for the Nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A point to note is that if&nbsp;we talk to disabled athletes, they want to achieve the highest sporting glory, and&nbsp;they want to be able to be rewarded.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;we ask them, \"What is your first priority?\" they would tell you, \"Accessibility and to be able to participate in sports as a life-long pursuit\", and also to balance that with their daily lives.&nbsp; So, if you ask me, where should the investment be put in, I would rather that the investment be put into the infrastructure for these disabled athletes.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Jessie Phua (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Unfortunately, I have reasons to believe otherwise.&nbsp; From personal experience, when&nbsp;we apply for support for full-time training for our local athletes, we were reminded, time and again, that we should <p align=left>Column: 3519<p>not be looking at welfare.&nbsp; Our local athletes were told to work towards balancing training and school or work.&nbsp; Against this backdrop, it would seem that support for full training for our foreign import athletes is a given.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, central counselling resource centre.&nbsp; Sir, yesterday's newspaper reported that yet another of our foreign import athlete, table tennis player Zhang Xue Ling is leaving for Shanghai.&nbsp; This is the latest addition to the count of three basketball, six hockey, one football and one badminton foreign athletes who have since left their sports.&nbsp; The reasons for their departure may vary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The benefit is self-evident.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> Sir, first, the point about fairness to local and foreign athletes.&nbsp; We believe that in the policies and the implementation today, there is fairness across the board.&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp;if<p align=left>Column: 3520<p> there are&nbsp;specific cases, I will encourage Mrs Jessie Phua to highlight them to me, so that I can look into them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is important about local and foreign athletes is that when foreign athletes come in, yes, most of the time they live with the little income that probably the NSAs disburse to them through the funding.&nbsp; They train&nbsp;full-time.&nbsp; Local athletes can do the same but sometimes they&nbsp;face family pressure as they have to balance their studies as well.&nbsp; They do not want to give up&nbsp;what they already have.&nbsp; But&nbsp;we already see that, through the Olympic project, there are some who have already put aside their studies or even their work to do full-time training.&nbsp; So, if there are specific cases, I would rather look into them and review them with the Member, and see what are the things that we can do.&nbsp; But we want to make sure that at the implementation and working level, there is fairness across the board for all local and foreign athletes, and they compete on a level playing field with no disadvantage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member mentioned about Zhang&nbsp;Xue Ling leaving.&nbsp; I read the report and I was also very saddened by that news, because she is one of our top players.&nbsp; But I have come to understand that she left for a good reason.&nbsp; She wants to spend more time with her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband left for Shanghai and she wants to be close to the family.&nbsp; So she left Singapore for Shanghai.&nbsp; What is more heartening is that she mentioned that if we needed her, she would be back.&nbsp; She will still play for Singapore because she is a Singaporean, and she came from this system here.&nbsp; I think that sense of identity and belonging is still there.&nbsp; But at this point in time, she probably believes that she can put her sporting career aside and make sure she spends time with her family, which MCYS is promoting as well.&nbsp; So I cannot say that that is not a good decision.&nbsp; But we welcome her back and we really would <p align=left>Column: 3521<p>like her to represent Singapore again for the right competition and to play internationally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the central counselling resource centre,&nbsp;I like the idea and we should explore it further, so as to help NSAs.&nbsp;I also believe that some smaller NSAs&nbsp;promoting very good sports&nbsp;may or may not have the type of support that they need.&nbsp; Maybe for volley ball, they could grow commercially&nbsp;- beach volley ball or gymnastics.&nbsp;There are a couple of good gymnasts&nbsp;and they can grow them.&nbsp; Maybe they need some support at the different pillars of the sport&nbsp;- Sports Excellence, High Sports Participation and Sports Industry.&nbsp; Yes, this is something to consider.&nbsp; We should take this back and maybe in time to come, we could set up a task force and include the people, private sector and all of us, and I hope Mrs Jessie Phua will also volunteer her efforts in this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I also beg to disagree with the Minister that the caregiver's allowance is necessarily what we call&nbsp; deadweight funding, and that it will dilute the amount of assistance that we can provide to the beneficiaries.&nbsp; The caregiver's allowance, just like the WIS, can be devised such that families who need more help will get more help and vice versa.&nbsp; In addition, the many available initiatives that the Minister had alluded to, such as&nbsp;tax relief, the maid levy concessions, etc, do not really benefit families from the lower middle-income families.&nbsp; Many of these families actually fall into the group where they either do not qualify for financial assistance or Workfare scheme available currently.&nbsp; Therefore, I urge the Ministry not to dismiss this totally but to consider studying how other countries are doing this, so that we can modify the scheme to best suit our needs and to reach out to those who actually need them most.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I think it would be good for all of us to know the difference between the two.&nbsp; The second point is on training for youth workers in general.&nbsp; Earlier, this was discussed in relation to the Malay community.&nbsp; Can I request some clarification on the current training for youth workers at MCYS?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</B> The centre for seniors is a VWO set up by NTUC Eldercare with five other partners and its focus would be on providing general counselling, a helpline, as well as counselling for work, ie, helping senior Singaporeans who want to find employment.&nbsp; Also, we will be looking at working with some partners on how to provide some programmes to keep the seniors actively engaged.&nbsp; There is&nbsp;obviously some duplication with the Centre for&nbsp;Third Age because the Centre for&nbsp;Third Age would be overseen by a Council that would actively work with different organisations to provide more activities for seniors.&nbsp; So&nbsp;you would regard the Centre for Third Age (C3A), which I announced yesterday, as the organisation that would be working with the different organisations that we have on how to do various things for seniors whereas the centre for seniors has got very limited and definite areas of interest.&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I will answer the question on training of youth workers.&nbsp; Actually, it is part of a larger question of social workers and other professionals in social services.&nbsp; When we started off, I think we were grateful that anyone would just say that&nbsp;he or she is a youth worker or a social worker.&nbsp; There were no minimum standards and no certification.&nbsp; Even today, I am not sure that we have a <p align=left>Column: 3526<p>formal register of social workers which allows someone to say that this person is a qualified&nbsp;or licensed social worker&nbsp;or not.&nbsp; But in the Ministry, and we have been discussing this with NCSS as well as the VWOs, we believe the time has come in Singapore to establish such a professional register to define the qualifications,&nbsp;training and experience, but this is not something which I want to impose.&nbsp; I want to work with the sector too because if you believe in social work and social services as a profession, then one hallmark of&nbsp;the profession is self-regulation.&nbsp; So&nbsp;my Ministry will work with the profession on this.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next thing then is that we also realise there is a need for professional upgrading, to stay in touch, and that is why I announced yesterday that we set aside funds which can be used to attend courses,&nbsp;take sabbaticals, and to make sure that with time, people get to refresh and sharpen their professional skills.&nbsp; The other issue we looked at was the capacity,&nbsp;ie, do we have training places in the universities&nbsp;and institutes of higher learning, even in the private centres? &nbsp;And also within NCSS, they have established what we call the SSTI (Social Services Training Institute).&nbsp; So, we are looking at a combination of measures - self-regulation, professional definition, professional upgrading and capacity for training.&nbsp; All in all,&nbsp;what we hope to achieve is that we will have enough social workers&nbsp;and&nbsp;youth workers.&nbsp; All these workers will be properly qualified, properly trained, and we will be able to have a self-sustaining sector well capable of upgrading itself.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef:</B> Two points, Sir.&nbsp;More and more Singapore NGOs&nbsp; are participating in humanitarian activities, both locally as well as overseas.&nbsp; We have heard MINDEF's response a couple of days ago about coordinating the efforts of local NGOs.&nbsp; I have seen smaller NGOs which are not so well coordinated on the<p align=left>Column: 3527<p> ground overseas.&nbsp; They seem to be lost and rather uncoordinated.&nbsp; I would like to seek the Minister's advice or&nbsp;plans as to whether this is a possibility of MCYS being the umbrella body to coordinate some of these NGOs under a Singapore-incorporated effort in responding to such disasters.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second point is pertaining to hotlines and improving communication channels.&nbsp; I would like to cite an example.&nbsp; I actually tried to call the destitute hotline over one-and-a-half days over a Friday and a Saturday with no response. This was pertaining to an elderly man, 70 years of age, and his companion, a 40-year old woman, who were living in the void deck.&nbsp;I tried to secure them a shelter and I actually had to personally call several nursing homes, even SAGE as well as several VWOs and family service centres, to actually locate shelter for them over the weekend.&nbsp;Actually, if the hotline works over the Friday and Saturday, it would be a lot better and easier for all of us.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> I apologise if the hotline service was not functioning.&nbsp; Next time, just call one of us directly.&nbsp; I think there is no excuse for these operational services to be unavailable.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I come back to the Member's first question on NGOs, particularly as they perform work overseas.&nbsp; I had a first-hand experience of this when the tsunami occurred.&nbsp; That was in December 2004.&nbsp; The first lesson I learnt was that there is a role for Government and there is also a separate and complementary role for NGOs.&nbsp; Yes, in terms of assets, the ability to mobilise resources -&nbsp;move, transport&nbsp;project, people and assets&nbsp;- nothing beats the military, and the military belongs to the Government. But in terms of volunteers, getting people to exercise compassion and donate money out of their own free will, that is surely the domain of NGOs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3528<p> Then the next issue that came up was coordination and there were calls at that time for MCYS to coordinate, to take the lead.&nbsp; I decided that MCYS would act as the secretariat.&nbsp; That means we would not lead&nbsp; but we would facilitate.&nbsp; We would help, we would connect and&nbsp;we would network.&nbsp; So, yes, we did call meetings but at all these meetings, I took great pains to ensure that leadership and ownership belonged to the non-government organisations, and I said that we were there to help&nbsp;them overcome obstacles, hurdles, and to connect&nbsp;them with the right people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of the tsunami, it was obviously getting people,&nbsp;the donations and the assets that they had collected and to be able to project them and their assets into the areas of operations. And, I think, at the end of that experience, it worked out quite nicely.&nbsp; There was not this sense that Government was taking over and running&nbsp;the NGOs because if we did that, they would no longer be NGOs.&nbsp; But another interesting thing happened.&nbsp; I think some NGOs - and I think&nbsp;the Member&nbsp;participated in at least a couple of those missions -&nbsp;after a while, decided that they would call themselves Team Singapore.&nbsp;I never imposed that on them but they called themselves Team Singapore and they happily and proudly put on the Singapore flag, and I want to encourage that kind of spontaneous self-organisation.&nbsp; Yes, Government will stand by, Government will support and facilitate, but let us keep the leadership and that sense of commitment,&nbsp;passion and ownership entirely with the people sector.&nbsp; So, I think, I can say with a fair amount of confidence that the level of trust and communication&nbsp;of our NGOs,&nbsp;Government and MCYS is probably at a reasonably happy and functioning level, and I think&nbsp;she can probably attest to that herself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Chairman, a few points of clarification.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3529<p> The Minister mentioned that&nbsp;the Ministry&nbsp;will play a facilitating role and work with the NGOs and also maintain the integrity of the NGOs.&nbsp; I think that is something that is laudable.

It is not an ongoing subsidy.&nbsp; Even if you take that example of microcredit for which Mohammad Yunus won a Nobel Prize, he did not receive a huge level of subsidies from the Government or the World Bank or any other developmental agency.&nbsp; What he had was an idea that made business sense, that was practical and then took off, because it was fundamentally right. Could the idea, however, have been facilitated if seed funding was available? The answer is, yes.&nbsp; But if the idea was fundamentally flawed and required long-term subsidies,&nbsp;it is not right anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3532<p> So all I am saying is, yes, social enterprises is something which we do want to explore for which we are willing to put seed funding.&nbsp; But let us not be too ideological about it.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Sir, I seek the Minister's response to the other recommendations in the Ageing Masterplan.

I am not talking about setting up another civil service committee.&nbsp;A group of experts out there, it needs people to sit down, review the literature and see what works, what does not work, what is useful, what is not useful, what is harmful, and then we need to make sure that parents and other stakeholders have access to this information and then rational choices will be made.&nbsp; Because, otherwise, now, you have a situation where people are reacting to hearsay or,&nbsp;worse, reacting to stuff they read on the Internet with no verification, and&nbsp;they are making all kinds of demands for all kinds of services which may or<p align=left>Column: 3534<p> may not do any good,&nbsp;and, as&nbsp;she herself has said, sometimes, it does more harm than good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her final point is on the IDA funding.&nbsp; In fact, MCYS also funds assistive technology.&nbsp; I will take the approach that I will make this available, not necessarily to just one agency, but to all VWOs that show they are capable of making these detailed evaluations as to what appliance or&nbsp;software programme is most applicable in these conditions.&nbsp; I have to strike a balance.&nbsp; If I take the money and distribute it equally to everyone, what is likely to happen is that each of&nbsp;the VWOs will never develop the depth of experience and expertise needed to make these detailed evaluations.&nbsp; On the other hand, if I give it to one person, then I have nine other VWOs who are very unhappy&nbsp;why I have given to that one monopoly.&nbsp; So my attitude is that I am not aiming for monopoly, but what I am aiming for is to have at least one and, preferably, more agencies that are capable of doing these detailed evaluations and matching IT appliances and IT programmes to the needs of the disabled.&nbsp; If&nbsp;she has organisations that are willing to put their hand out, I am sure my staff will be happy to consider.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; I will allow clarifications up to 2.30 pm.&nbsp; Mr Baey Yam Keng.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Baey Yam Keng (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Sir, this is a question for the Parliamentary Secretary.&nbsp; In the promotion of&nbsp;sporting culture and high participation in sports, accessibility to sports facilities should be important and key.&nbsp; In providing funding for NSAs and in setting&nbsp;their KPIs, how does the Ministry differentiate between those which have easy access to almost free facilities, for example, athletes can always jog any time anywhere, basketball courts which&nbsp;are available in many neighbourhoods built by&nbsp;town councils, versus those which have to pay much to<p align=left>Column: 3535<p> rent or hire facilities to practise, for example, volleyball.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, I have to declare my interest as the President of the Volleyball Association of Singapore.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> The funding allocation is based on three pillars and we have repeated that many times, and I will repeat that again -&nbsp;sports excellence, high participation and sports industry. When a fund is disbursed, we need to look at the&nbsp;long-term plan of what the NSA is trying to achieve for its athletes. So whatever you are trying to achieve in training, and achievements, it must be supported, of course, by the facilities and all that you need to build the infrastructure for that achievement or&nbsp;training.&nbsp; So the fund is disbursed according to your needs and, of course, as&nbsp;he knows, there is a limitation of resources.&nbsp; So most of the time, we are unable to give&nbsp;100% of what you ask for.&nbsp; But that is exactly why in my speech,&nbsp;I emphasised the fact that the Sports Council and&nbsp;the Ministry will, together with NSAs, as a consolidated effort,&nbsp;look at additional funding from the private sector, and we can have the private sector involved as well.&nbsp; So it is a&nbsp;3P partnership.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us say, in the case of volley ball,&nbsp;if you are looking for additional facilities for beach volley ball, then, of course, the&nbsp;beach is there but you probably need to demarcate it&nbsp;for competition.&nbsp;What do you need in order to do that?&nbsp; What exactly are you&nbsp;trying to achieve from there?&nbsp; Are you organising an international event?&nbsp; And if you are organising an international event, say, for&nbsp;beach volley ball, and you need to upgrade the sand regardless of whether there is a sand ban or not, that will be by project and the funding can be considered to be given out on a project basis.&nbsp; So it could be a long-term plan, it could be a short-term plan, based on the needs of the sports and the association.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 3536<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The point I was trying to make is that every family will have different needs and preferences.&nbsp; I am not by any stretch of the imagination claiming that what we are offering as public assistance is a generous package.&nbsp; I am not saying that.&nbsp; But what I am saying is that it is enough, by and large, for most families to get by and, for those who have needs over and beyond that, there are other means to do so.&nbsp; If every one was starving on this amount that we are giving and is&nbsp;totally devoid of any other sources of help, Pelangi Home would be overcrowded, and&nbsp;I would be building many, many more Pelangi Homes.&nbsp; So, in the end, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.&nbsp; Yes, any one of us, if we search hard enough, may be able to find a family or people who need additional help.&nbsp; But I would also say that any one of us, if we really put our minds to it, is capable of finding those additional sources of help.&nbsp; What I am designing is a system in which <p align=left>Column: 3537<p>public assistance can and should be complemented by other sources of help.&nbsp; I think we can continue arguing this and we can continue finetuning the exact amount that is needed.&nbsp; But let us just bear in mind the fact that the system is set up with a certain amount of tension, and it is a healthy tension.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I cannot resist saying that I am very disappointed that in the whole debate on MCYS, the Opposition MPs have not participated in this, and I have actually faced real probing questions more from the PAP MPs and the Nominated MPs.&nbsp; Perhaps, they totally agree with my policies, philosophy and programmes.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Right now, it is extremely difficult for them to try and eke out a living in order to be self-sufficient.&nbsp; I have a resident who was fined $200 for selling something in a public place.&nbsp; But then he came to me and said, \"But that is the way. &nbsp;I need the money for my family.&nbsp;

I agree with the Member that we need to be flexible.&nbsp; But I think that we also need to understand - the Minister for the Environment is not here - that NEA also has to manage its own set of trade-offs.&nbsp; Hygiene, food poisoning, public health, waste disposal are&nbsp;always an issue.&nbsp; The solution - again, to use Dr Teo Ho Pin as an example - is, if at the local level, you can organise it such that people can make some money, generate some living, and&nbsp;it is safe, hygienic and does not break any rules, or, if need be, come to the Ministries and change those rules so that they are more flexible and&nbsp;people do not get fined.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

To&nbsp;me, this is healthy.&nbsp; It shows a society in which the work ethic is still there, opportunities are still present, people still care and we have a system of government that is responsive and flexible to enable us to take care of the most vulnerable members of our society in a way which keeps their self-respect and allows all of us to live and do well with a clear conscience.&nbsp;

Actually, among the Mayors, I should say that we still need to streamline the standards.&nbsp; Some take the six weeks from the receipt of the case.&nbsp; Others take the six weeks from the date they communicate with the applicants.&nbsp; So I think there is still&nbsp;a need&nbsp;to standardise that.&nbsp; But, on average, I should say they have done a wonderful job.&nbsp; If you compare with&nbsp;2001, ie, before we set up ComCare or CDC, MCYS took about three months on average.&nbsp; When the CDCs took over, they reduced it to about eight weeks.&nbsp; Now they are working hard to reduce it to within six weeks.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;even in some cases, if we think six weeks are too long to help them, then we should use the CCC ComCare&nbsp;Fund.&nbsp; Yesterday, some MPs mentioned that we need to ask for more funds.&nbsp; Of course, I am sure Members know that the Minister has also announced that the CCC ComCare Fund will have an additional $5 million&nbsp;for the next five years.&nbsp; But on going&nbsp;through the accounts, I do agree that some wards, eg,&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo's, would have more destitutes or aged people and need more funds.&nbsp; But I should say that<p align=left>Column: 3540<p> some of the wards&nbsp;still have quite big sums of balance.&nbsp; So, maybe the Mayors can also help us to adjust and coordinate the funds a little, to redistribute the funds to those wards that need more.&nbsp; And I hope that the Advisors and the Chairmen of the CCC ComCare Fund can apply the flexibility to really see that cases that need immediate help would be given help from this fund, to help them for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister also said, besides the ComCare Fund, at this moment, we have a lot of help at the ground level, especially&nbsp;the free meals.&nbsp; A needy person can have a meal without having to pay any cent.&nbsp; For example, Moral Home has a <I>halal</I> kitchen that provides free meals to a few thousand ---</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head W of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have heard many Budget and COS debates following the Budget announcement by Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.&nbsp; The Singapore public is understandably concerned about the <p align=left>Column: 3542<p>distribution aspects of this Budget.&nbsp; This is also reflected in the many discussions in this House.&nbsp; But lest we get too carried away into distribution issues, we would do well to remember that, to be a successful nation, the first order of business for Government is to invest in economic growth.&nbsp; Unless the Government can continue to attract new investments to grow the economic pie, we would not have much to discuss for distribution since there would be little left for distribution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The business community applauds Singapore's bold move to cut corporate tax by 2%.&nbsp; Whether Singapore can succeed depends not only on what we do but what other competing economies do.&nbsp; This is a point often lost for the population at large.&nbsp; I was often asked why do we need to cut the corporate rate to help companies whilst increasing GST which hurts resident consumers.&nbsp; The simple answer is that we are not acting alone in this globalised world.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we do not have a competitive tax regime and other economies do, then, willy-nilly, jobs in Singapore would be lost.&nbsp; How could that be good for Singaporeans?&nbsp; If we get the formula right, and the stimulus effect of a competitive tax regime kicks in, I would not be surprised if we chalked up budget surpluses in the years to come, and budget surplus is not a bad word.&nbsp; Ours is the envy of many economies and, with surpluses, we can then indulge more in discussions about distribution and reinvestments, a luxury many economies could ill-afford.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, low taxes are a necessary condition for success but it is not sufficient.&nbsp; Maintaining rule of law, enhancing national security, promoting public safety, keeping regulations light, ensuring a business-friendly environment, and investing in education and infrastructure are all critical factors which make for a competitive Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 3543<p>Sir, I would like to focus now on infrastructural investments.&nbsp; Singapore's GDP grew by 7.9% last year and is projected to do well in the short to medium-term.&nbsp; We would also be seeking to increase the resident population and tourist arrivals as we open our doors to our two integrated resorts to tourists the world over.&nbsp; What does all this growth mean?&nbsp; More containers through our seaport, more passengers at our airport and more trips on our roads and trains.&nbsp; To cater to such a high projected growth, it is imperative that we invest in advance of demand, so as to enhance our transport connectivity and efficiency, both internationally and domestically.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, on aviation.&nbsp; Bangkok will get over the teething problems of the new Suvarnabumi Airport.&nbsp; This airport has a capacity of 45 million passengers. Bangkok itself is also a more attractive airport because of its proximity to the major cities around it, and it is also a popular destination in itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further afield, Dubai has announced an ambitious plan to build a mega airport capable of handling 120 million passengers. That is almost three times that of&nbsp;Bangkok Airport.&nbsp; If Dubai succeeds, long-range aircraft from Europe could stop at Dubai and then fly directly to Australia and, in the process, by-passing Singapore altogether. This so-called \"kangaroo\" route is today an important revenue source for Changi and Singapore-based airlines.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The heat is on, the competition to become hub ports is clearly underway.&nbsp; I am therefore very interested to get an update from the Minister on how we are positioning Changi to meet these challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the maritime sector, Singapore has established itself as one of the top container&nbsp;ports in the world.&nbsp; Last year, Singapore recorded 24.8 million TEUs, or Twenty-foot Equivalent Units&nbsp;against <p align=left>Column: 3544<p>Hong Kong's 23.2 million TEUs and Shanghai's 21.7 million TEUs.&nbsp; They are almost equal amongst the three cities. But, just five years ago, the figures for Singapore was 15.6 million TEUs; Hong Kong a little higher, 17.9 million TEUs; and Shanghai, a mere 6.3 million TEUs.&nbsp; So if you work out the maths, the&nbsp;CAGR&nbsp;or compound annual growth rate is 9.7%&nbsp; for Singapore over the last five years; 5.3% for Hong Kong; and 28.1% for Shanghai.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these rates, the trend is clear. Shanghai will overtake Singapore within a year or two as the busiest container port in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore must therefore go beyond just handling container volumes, but to build itself as a comprehensive and total maritime hub. This involves making Singapore a major finance, brokering, insurance and arbitration centre for shipping. Indeed, these activities could have given higher value-add than container handling.&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I welcome the Budget announcement to extend the Approved Shipping Logistics Enterprise Incentive from 5 to 10 years and that container services will be zero-rated for GST purposes.&nbsp; At the same time, I would be very interested to hear about MOT's plan to grow the maritime sector and also to address the manpower shortages confronting the shipping industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, land transport. We are gearing ourselves up for a resident population of about 6.5 million people.&nbsp; For this to happen, without Singapore roads ending up in gridlocks, we need a major revamp of our land transport infrastructure, both physical&nbsp;as well as policies.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the Ministry is embarking on a land transport review and would like to know the progress of this study.&nbsp; It would be good if the Minister could also share with us some of his early thoughts on the land transport review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment, we have more questions than answers. What is the <p align=left>Column: 3545<p>projected growth in land transport demand?&nbsp; What standards are&nbsp;we aiming for, as regards public transport services, waiting time, transfer time and&nbsp;journey time?&nbsp; How do we keep the cost of public transport competitive and affordable?&nbsp; How can we encourage more commuters to use public transport?&nbsp; How are investment decisions made for MRT and road capacity expansion? Would the supply of road and MRT capacity lag demand? Should public transport operators continue to assume fair or revenue risk, or should they compete on service and cost efficiency alone?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has an excellent transport infrastructure. The transport infrastructure is an important consideration for companies as they weigh the merits of basing in Singapore vis-a-vis other cities. Whether we can continue to win them over depends on whether we are prepared to take bold and innovative investments and measures to retain Singapore's pole position in transport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOT plays a critical role and I look forward to hearing the Ministry's plan to meet these challenges.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Traffic Management</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> Sir, I would like to now touch on some mundane local traffic management issues.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to other major cities, it is quite&nbsp;a breeze to drive in Singapore most times of the day and night.&nbsp; Outside of the morning and evening peak hours, our traffic is generally smooth flowing, so much so that travelling time is predictable and we can time our journey almost to the minute.&nbsp; \"Being caught in traffic\" is not a common excuse we hear for being late.&nbsp; However, from time to time, traffic jams still catch us by surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3546<p> I would like to urge MOT to find effective ways to warn motorists when such unexpected congestion arises. There is, at present, the&nbsp;radio broadcast, such as Trafficwatch, but it relies on calls from the public. Can we have a more systematic way to compile and disseminate traffic news?&nbsp; How about a dedicated radio channel for traffic news or an SMS service where the motorists can text the name of a road or landmark, and the SMS reply will inform him of any congestion in that vicinity?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, we are&nbsp;caught in a long, snaking jams, only to find, when we get to the source, a minor accident and some motorists exchanging particulars in the middle of the road.&nbsp; What a waste of valuable productive time for every person stuck in that jam!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to improve efficiency of handling accidents and vehicle breakdowns. The performance of LTA, in managing road traffic, should include how promptly accident and breakdown vehicles are removed and how quickly traffic flow can be restored to normal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our authorities have deployed a slew of measures to get traffic flowing smoothly, the main one being ERP.&nbsp; Recently, ERP rates for some heavily used sections have increased and it seems that the LTA will have to increase ERP further if average traffic speed does not improve.&nbsp; I do not think LTA has any way out of not increasing ERP rates if and when traffic builds up. If you charge $4 and traffic is still crawling, drivers who are stuck there will ask, \"Pay so much for what? Still jam!\"&nbsp; Singaporeans are brought up to expect good value for money. When we pay for something, we expect to see results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can ERP ensure a smooth-flowing traffic?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a psychological limit to how much higher ERP rates can go, beyond which the motoring public will go&nbsp;up in<p align=left>Column: 3547<p> arms.&nbsp; Paying ERP is painful. How much pain do road users have to bear to enjoy smooth-flowing traffic?&nbsp;LTA says&nbsp;it is the motorist's choice, but many people do not have much of a choice, but to use that road during that time because the alternative is even costlier in terms of time, cost and convenience.&nbsp; Are we prepared to pay $5, maybe $10, every time&nbsp;we pass through an ERP gantry?&nbsp; I think LTA should find out before we go down this ERP road further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not believe ERP is a sustainable solution as our population increases towards the 6.5 million mark.&nbsp; Mass rapid public transport is the way to go, but there are many areas that we need to improve.&nbsp; To increase its usage, MOT should focus on making public transport a more attractive mode of travel and not by making private cars more expensive or more inconvenient to use.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also remove as many of the obstacles and objections to taking public transport as possible.&nbsp; If our connectivity to public transport is better, more people will come on board. Other major cities have vast networks of underground passages and above-ground covered walkways, even underground plazas linking the buildings to MRT stations through which people can move almost seamlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our freaky weather of rain and shine in the&nbsp;last few months is a&nbsp;good&nbsp;reminder to all of us of the risk of being caught&nbsp;by the rain, of not being able to get across a street from the bus-stop or MRT station without getting drenched.&nbsp; It is no wonder that motorists want to drive and park, not just near, but at their final destination.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Mr Chairman, the ERP has been used since 1997 or 1998 as a traffic management tool.&nbsp; But after almost 10 years, many of the expressways and main arterial roads remain congested during peak hours.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you use the CTE to work during the<p align=left>Column: 3548<p>morning peak, you have to pay ERP charges of up to $7.50 to travel to the city.&nbsp; On your return trip in the evening, you pay up to $1.50.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But despite paying all these ERP charges, you are not guaranteed a smooth trip on the expressway.&nbsp; On the contrary, during the peak hours, the expressway is likely to remain congested. Each time, when &nbsp;LTA announces that ERP charges will increase, there will be a slight reduction in traffic along the CTE, or for that matter, any other expressway. This will&nbsp;last for a few days.&nbsp; However, the joy is short-lived as the traffic, which initially goes away, will eventually return as the motorists realise that there is no real alternative to using these expressways.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traffic congestion along the alternative arterial roads is worse as the motorists had to contend with many traffic lights plus heavy traffic.&nbsp; Some of the arterial roads also have ERP gantries.&nbsp; So, whichever way you travel, you pay ERP charges.&nbsp; Thus, within a few weeks, the traffic returns back to the same level of congestion and traffic is chock-a-block again this expressway until the next revision in ERP charges. The cycle then starts all over again as motorists continue to look for alternative routes,&nbsp;only to conclude that there is no real alternative.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact, Sir, is that despite several increases in the ERP charges, the traffic congestion along expressways during peak hours does not seem much improved. Hence, I will submit that simply raising ERP charges as&nbsp;a means to manage traffic congestion has its limitations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether LTA has any other plans to manage traffic congestion besides increasing ERP charges.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister whether LTA would be willing to have&nbsp;a dedicated team of road <p align=left>Column: 3549<p>engineers to re-look at the green link determining system (GLIDE) with a view of improving traffic flow during peak hours. Currently, many motorists complain that the arterial roads are not a useful alternative to the expressway because of uncoordinated traffic lights, and I am sure many Members in this House would likewise agree.&nbsp; This results in traffic jams and start-stop conditions due to the lack of a green flow traffic light system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the hon. Member, Mr Ong Kian Min, I would also like to ask the Minister whether he will be prepared to consider a better traffic information system like a dedicated radio station during the morning and evening peaks that does nothing but broadcasts traffic information so&nbsp;that a motorist can&nbsp;make a more informed choice and plan his route accordingly.&nbsp; Just to give an example.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I left Parliament on&nbsp;Monday evening, I travelled for 15 minutes to reach the entrance of the CTE tunnel.&nbsp; And there, I saw the EMAS message saying \"Massive jam in CTE tunnel\".&nbsp; If I had known of the massive jam, I would have simply avoided&nbsp;using that route and saved myself 15 minutes and I would also not contribute to the traffic congestion in making my way to the CTE tunnel entrance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to ask the Minister whether he would look into having more monitoring and enforcement action against heavy or slow-moving vehicles that hog the roads during peak hours.&nbsp; Sir, I understand the Minister's preference is to encourage greater use of public transport, but until the real system is more widespread and the bus system more efficient, most Singapore will&nbsp;prefer to save their time and drive at their convenience. There are many motorists who feel that increasing ERP is an easy solution to a difficult problem and many of them are&nbsp;middle-income and they feel that they are being squeezed to pay more for <p align=left>Column: 3550<p>using the roads. They also feel that congestion comes about because of inadequate planning of road infrastructure vis-a-vis the large number of housing estates which are springing up in the north and the east.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to consider all other options to&nbsp;improve the management of traffic before resorting to increases in ERP charges.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Land Transport System</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Sir, the Ministry has commissioned consultants to do a comprehensive review of our land transport system.&nbsp; The Minister has indicated that one of the main issues the consultants will look at is how to increase ridership on public transport. The aim is to enhance public transport such that it no longer just caters to those who cannot afford a car. Its vision is one that public transport is so attractive that even car owners will choose to leave their cars behind and hop onto a bus or train.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, given the increased road congestion that we have been experiencing over the years, I wholeheartedly agree that reducing car trips will make life better for everyone and hence, I support this bold vision of the Minister to make public transport a competitor to the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: how can we convince drivers to leave their cars behind? This is a tall order as there would be great&nbsp;inertia and&nbsp;reluctance to give up the independence of private transport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve this, the enhancement to the public transport system should&nbsp;focus on the following.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, it should give people the right to get to where they want to go without too many transfers, ie, there is good connectivity.

I remember that in 1978-1979, as an external auditor, it took me four hours' bus ride from Punggol end to Jurong Town&nbsp; in the morning.&nbsp; But there are still areas that I feel we can improve&nbsp;and do even better to make our system affordable and efficient.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our planning is projected&nbsp;on the assumption of&nbsp;a population of 6.5 million, the number of people travelling around the country would increase exponentially.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;increase would lead to demands for<p align=left>Column: 3554<p> more land to be converted for transportation, such as to extend and broaden the road networks, car parks, bus interchanges and new MRT lines.&nbsp; The work that needs to be done is&nbsp;of great magnitude and, as such, requires an extensive amount of planning and coordination.&nbsp; In light of this, I would like, first, to ask whether there are any long-term plans or policies that have been developed to ensure that Singapore is able to effectively meet the increasing land transport demands in the next 40-50 years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our increasing diverse and a more socially active population, what will be the future composition of the different types of land transport in Singapore, eg,&nbsp;the composition between the use of cars and our public transport modes of buses and rail?&nbsp; Will our waterways be an option for transport?&nbsp; Perhaps those who live by the seafront will own boats instead of cars.&nbsp; Are there other means of alternative transport systems that LTA is looking at?&nbsp; Can the Minister describe to us the future scenario?&nbsp; Maybe we can have \"flying\" cars as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the increasing trend on the use of cars, can the Minister tell us, as we are working towards a world-class public transport system, how can we persuade and&nbsp;attract our population to use the public transport system?&nbsp;

Connectivity, reliability, comfort and convenience are the four attributes that our commuters demand from our public transport system.&nbsp; How are these being measured?&nbsp; Do we have standards to note?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, what could stand in our way of a larger population may well be transport, ie, if we cannot get our act together.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent mid-term concept plan review, our population planning parameter was increased from 5.5 million to 6.5 million.&nbsp; Travel demands will increase, though there would be limited land for more road space. The plan calls for a more sustainable solution, which is to increase public transport utilisation.&nbsp; It aims to raise the share of trips taken on public transport from the current 63% to 70% over the next 10 -15 years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, we are likely to see more foreigners using our transport system, such as tourists, numbering about 17 million by 2015, foreign workers and business visitors.&nbsp; Our stronger economic activity would also lead to higher<p align=left>Column: 3556<p> workforce participation and therefore more travels needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, against this backdrop, I want to raise two issues here.&nbsp;Firstly, our public transport systems in some routes are already near capacity or at capacity during peak hours.&nbsp; The concern among Singaporeans is whether our system will be able to keep pace with our fast rising population and the higher public usage.&nbsp; Let us&nbsp;not forget that from 1990 to 2000, in a span of 10 years, we actually added&nbsp;about one&nbsp;million to our residential population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two days ago, my grassroots leaders and I took the LRT from Bukit Panjang Town to Choa Chua Kang MRT Station, with the journey ending at City Hall Station.&nbsp; We set off at about 7.30 am and reached City Hall Station at about 8.30 am - &nbsp;about an hour's journey.&nbsp; As the train approached downtown locations like Tiong Bahru, Redhill and Outram Park, it became very crowded. &nbsp;One commuter sighed that it&nbsp;was even worse on the way home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My concern is: &nbsp;would the train not become even more crowded if we really do succeed in getting more Singaporeans to switch from car to trains, not to mention the added traffic from the likely increase in population base?&nbsp; &nbsp;I can hardly imagine how our public transport system will be able to cope when the centrepiece of our Marina Bay city redevelopment Marina Bay is completed.&nbsp; There will be even more office workers travelling to the city centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have observed that the train-to-train interval is already about&nbsp;three minutes during peak hours.&nbsp; I do not think we could cut it any shorter or add more trains onto the existing lines without compromising safety.&nbsp; Sir, we need to boost capacity, as identified by the Concept Plan, and we need to do it pretty quickly.&nbsp; Hence, I would like to clarify with the Minister whether the Government is going ahead <p align=left>Column: 3557<p>with the Downtown Line, as there was a brief mention of it in the Budget Statement.&nbsp; If it is indeed so, can the Minister give us some indication of the timeline?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Downtown Line will be a&nbsp;welcome relief to residents from North Western and the Eastern parts of the island.&nbsp; It will free up the commuter load on the East-West Line and allow residents from these areas to have a more direct route to the city centre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on the road system.&nbsp;The Concept Plan rightly pointed out that there will be limited land for more road space.&nbsp; Some segments of our major expressways are already four-lane wide.&nbsp; Can the Ministry shed some light as to how much more road space we can add on?&nbsp; For example, for the existing major expressways like PIE and CTE, will it be&nbsp;possible to add more road space?&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we succeed in increasing the share of public transport to 70%, how much will it help to ease road congestion?&nbsp; Would the slack be picked up by the increase in population and higher car usage as we saw recently?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that between 1997 and 2004, our car population grew by 10%, from 377,000 to 417,000. &nbsp;More alarmingly, for the same period, the daily number of car trips generated increased by 23%, which is double the rate of the car population increase.&nbsp; I guess&nbsp;Singaporeans are just trying to&nbsp;do justice to the cars that they bought.&nbsp; That is why they are using it more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the solutions to our transport challenge cannot be executed without changes to the way we work and to our lifestyles, in addition to careful town planning. &nbsp;We may need to implement policies to persuade and expedite the adoption of telecommuting and flexi <p align=left>Column: 3558<p>working hours, both by the public and private sectors.&nbsp; This will reduce the demands on our transport system during peak hours.&nbsp; Our recreational facilities must also be well served by public transport so as to reduce the need to drive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that our policy makers also see that transportation could well be the main impediment to Singapore achieving the status of a First World First Tier City. That is why the Budget Statement mentions that the Government expects to spend at least $20 billion on our land transport infrastructure over the next 10 to 15 years.&nbsp;I hope the Minister will share with us more details of the plans to enhance our transportation infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans need the assurance from the Government that even as we increase our population, our land transport system,&nbsp;our road system and our public transport system are able to cope with this increase, and that our quality of life will not be compromised.<br>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Multi-modal Competition</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Sir, I would like to declare my interest as a director of a transportation company.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When our MRT network was first set up some 20 years ago, bus routes in areas served by MRT were re-routed to minimise duplication.&nbsp; We need to provide our commuters with more choice as well as increase our mass transport capacity.&nbsp; The policy has reduced the number of point-to-point bus services.&nbsp; Although the MRT is more reliable, predictable and speedier, a significant segment of commuters still prefer point-to-point services for good reasons.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of commuters has increased over the last 20 years.&nbsp; Between 1990 and 2000, Singapore's population has increased by about a million.&nbsp; We have<p align=left>Column: 3559<p> already introduced the premium bus guidelines which allow operators to provide direct services at higher fares.&nbsp; However, it is not enough.&nbsp; We should allow public buses to run routes served by MRT as well.&nbsp; So the public has more choice and&nbsp;better able to enjoy public transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bus services carry around twice as many passengers&nbsp;than trains today.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister what other plans he has in mind to improve buses for Singaporeans.&nbsp; An important point I can think of is even greater priority for buses on the roads.&nbsp; Unlike MRT, buses compete for road space with other vehicles, making travelling time longer and less reliable.&nbsp; Indeed, over the years, bus speeds have reduced while general vehicle speeds have improved.&nbsp; If we want quick improvements in public transport, we should maybe look at London and increase our investments in the bus mode.&nbsp; In so doing, we will be able to reach out to more people within a much shorter timeframe.&nbsp; Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, this increase in public choice will drive the provision of better services.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Buses</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min:</B> Sir, when I attended ACJC some 30 years ago, I took about 60 minutes to go home by bus to Katong.&nbsp; The same journey by car took half the time&nbsp;-&nbsp;about 30 minutes.&nbsp; Today, my daughters go to&nbsp;a school about 10 minutes' car ride from home, but they take between four and eight times as long to reach home by bus&nbsp;-&nbsp;40 minutes if the bus comes soon after they reach the bus stop, and 80 minutes if they just miss the bus and have to wait for the next one.&nbsp; It therefore makes sense for me to use the car to pick them up.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to encourage more people to take the bus, waiting and travelling time must be reduced, and the bus system must offer such convenience that one can get<p align=left>Column: 3560<p> around easily and economically without having the need of a private car.

This is especially important and of much&nbsp;public interest as it affects all of us.&nbsp; We know that the ez-link system was developed using a proprietary technology perhaps to meet some critical and special transportation requirements.&nbsp; However, there are also indications that solutions using open platform and standards will bring about reduced overall operational costs as well as increased usage.&nbsp; We must learn from the experiences that Singapore market is too small for&nbsp;proprietary cards and readers that do not benefit the citizens in terms of usage and costs.&nbsp; Has LTA initiated migration to an open platform to take advantage of lower cost solutions available in market from multiple sources?&nbsp; If it has done so, when would the system be ready?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the ez-link technology is held by LTA and with the Yellow Pages guideline, when is LTA hiving off this non-core business instead of&nbsp; this continued link to LTA, a statutory board?&nbsp; The reason is that if it continues to be within LTA umbrella, it has already a ready captive market and there is no push for the&nbsp;authority&nbsp; to look for cheaper solutions for the citizens and a&nbsp;wider usage of the cards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans embrace new technology readily,&nbsp;looking at the number of people changing to PDA phones.

Currently, they are only entitled to concession fares during off-peak hours. In Singapore, there is a growing trend of elderly workers staying in the workforce beyond retirement age and the majority of these elderly workers are in low-paid jobs such as hawker centre cleaners and kitchen attendants. To substantiate my point, please refer to the National Family Survey carried out in 2005. It was reported that workers who are 60 years old have two times longer working hours as compared to those who are 39 years old or younger.&nbsp; In this regard, I would like to urge the SMRT and SBS Transit to consider giving elderly workers concession fares regardless of whether it is during off-peak or peak hours.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another point, the concession fares that the elderly enjoy are not applicable to Express Bus Services, NightRider, buses to the city, and direct buses to Chinatown and the National Stadium, etc. In view of the contributions they have made to the society, public transport service providers should consider giving them round-the-clock concession fares, and it should apply to all bus routes. Similarly, it should work just like the student concession rate that we are giving to primary and secondary school students.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Taxis</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang):</B> Sir, with the liberalisation of the taxi industry,&nbsp;the taxi population has been growing in the past few years.&nbsp; What is&nbsp;MOT's policy&nbsp;for new taxi companies?&nbsp; It is likely that there will be more new taxi companies, with more taxis on the road, leading to keener competition not only for <div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3651-3652.<BR></div></P></div>\t <p align=left>Column: 3564<p>taxi companies for taxi drivers but also&nbsp;taxi drivers for passengers.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under the Labour Movement 2011, about 200 leaders from the six taxi associations met recently and discussed the challenges facing the taxi industry in the next five years.&nbsp; In view of the liberalisation of the taxi industry, uncertainty of fuel oil prices and Government's public transport policy, they also discussed how taxi drivers as a group can respond to them with the support from the Government and the taxi companies.&nbsp; We know that all taxi companies are now competing to provide more job value to taxi drivers.&nbsp; Both LTA and the taxi industry are also trying to figure out how to improve taxi services and&nbsp;the quality to support the new phase of&nbsp;economic growth of Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, leaders of six taxi associations have come out with&nbsp;five policy recommendations:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) redefine taxi service as transporter for goods, people and services and develop competent taxi&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;to give good taxi service;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) make taxi driving a choice career and develop an industry development approach to regulate taxi service;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) equate both the cost and value of taxis and private cars to help taxi drivers build their social safety net;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) maximise the use of taxi service, pricing&nbsp;mechanism; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) put in resources to nurture positive market forces to drive taxi service development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge LTA to actively engage the drivers of the association on the issues they face and look into the policy recommendations.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 3565<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min:</B> Sir, everyone knows how difficult it can be to get a taxi, especially on rainy days, during peak hours or just before midnight.&nbsp; The secret to getting a taxi at such times is to pick up the phone and call for one.&nbsp; Why does it feel impossible to get a taxi just when you need it the most?&nbsp; I believe the one main reason is that the extra fees and surcharges make a meaningful difference to the daily takings of a taxi driver.&nbsp; The advance booking fee of $5.20, the current booking fee of $4 during peak hours and the late night charges are just too high and too irresistible for our taxi drivers not to change their behaviour to earn these extras.&nbsp; Another reason is that taxi drivers are unwilling to pay the ERP charges to enter the CBD or Orchard Road to pick up passengers unless they already have a passenger in their taxi who has to pay for it.&nbsp; In Hong Kong where there seems to be little problem in getting a taxi, there are no peak hour surcharges, no midnight surcharges and the booking fee is only either 4 or 5 Hong Kong dollars, which is about S$1.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our taxi fare structure can be bewildering to our foreign visitors.&nbsp; First, they may be ignorant of the open secret of using the call booking system to secure a cab.&nbsp; Secondly, even if they do, they may not have the service numbers of the cab companies to call or they may find it inconvenient to call them. And, thirdly, they may be surprised by the barrage of call booking charges,&nbsp;late night charges, peak hour and CBD surcharges and the ERP charges that they have to pay on top of the metered fare.&nbsp; There have been numerous calls to improve our taxi availability by reducing the call booking fee, removing late night charges and even getting the public to report taxis that circle round and round with an \"On Call\" sign on the pretext that there has been an assigned booking.&nbsp; I strongly urge the Minister to review the taxi system and take measures to improve the availability of taxis.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 3566<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Lee Bee Wah--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Accidents at MRT Stations</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Lee Bee Wah:</B> Sir, a number of tragic accidents have occurred at the MRT stations.&nbsp; 87% of these cases are of the commuters' fault in either going onto the tracks to retrieve fallen property, playing around beyond the safety yellow line and, of recently, a series of suicides.&nbsp; As a result, there have been many calls for the LTA to put up railings or a gate system that could perhaps be adapted from the way our underground MRT stations work.&nbsp; This would allow commuters to only step beyond the platform when the train has arrived and open their sliding doors.&nbsp; I understand that this option has been brought to the attention of the Minister for Transport previously and he had cited, \"As safety provisions such as platforms, screen doors are costly to install and maintain, we will have to weigh the efficacy of installing more safety measures against the additional costs to public transport&nbsp;provision.\"&nbsp; I think the Ministry should consider how much is too much to protect a human life.&nbsp; One life lost is one too many.&nbsp; Work out the sums on the knock-on effect when an accident occurs.&nbsp; Services will have to be disrupted, free shuttle services will have to be deployed, officers will have to be assigned to redirect traffic,&nbsp;time spent in investigating the cause of the accident, other passengers being late for work or appointments, etc.&nbsp; There is a whole change of events that will follow, and this coupled with the emotional and financial loss to the next-of-kin of the victims.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to revisit their policy.&nbsp; In Hong Kong, a $2 billion project was completed in 2005, which saw their stations being fitted with sliding doors which serve well to prevent commuters from falling onto the tracks either deliberately or otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Overhead Bridges</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another issue I would want to raise is: how can we help our senior <p align=left>Column: 3567<p>citizens to be more mobile?&nbsp; While we have been working on various projects to make our environment barrier-free, I would urge the Ministry to consider installing escalators at overhead bridges near to MRT stations.&nbsp; These overhead bridges are located near the stations so as to serve as an access point for people who want to use the trains.&nbsp; Without an escalator, many old people would find it a challenge to have to climb up the&nbsp;flight of&nbsp;stairs, then walk across and, again, climb down another few flight of stairs, such as the one at Khatib MRT.&nbsp;Besides serving the senior citizens, the escalators will also be a welcome benefit for pregnant women, school children&nbsp;or adults with heavy hand luggage and for the handicapped.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am asking for are only the overhead bridges near MRT stations&nbsp;- please do not tell me that that is costly.&nbsp; If you want to divide the cost by the number of users, I am sure it is worth considering and please also do not tell me that that is expensive to maintain.&nbsp; Nowadays, the technology is very advanced and we have escalators designed for outdoor use.&nbsp; In view of the ageing population and more and more elderly who are working or shopping for groceries, the provision of escalators is a necessity.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wee Siew Kim:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, the hon.

The aim is to ensure a smooth traffic flow and achieve optimal economic efficiency. However, every morning or evening, as I pass the AYE, I have to face the inevitable slow traffic or being stuck in a traffic jam. This happens almost every day. Although the ERP system has been installed on the AYE, we see slow traffic and traffic jams happening all the time. The immediate reaction from the Ministry of Transport is to increase ERP charges.&nbsp; I feel that this merely alleviates the problem but will not effect a permanent cure. Also, it is not a fair solution to the drivers.&nbsp; Before installing the ERP system, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has developed a set of key performance indicators (KPIs)<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 3653-3654.<BR></div></P></div>\t <p align=left>Column: 3570<p>of a speed limit of 45 to 65 km per hour. This is to ensure that drivers will ultimately enjoy smooth traffic conditions. But results have shown otherwise.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I would like to suggest to the Minister that if the speed limit imposed cannot be achieved, then LTA should stop collecting ERP charges. In this regard, I do believe that all drivers will support my suggestion. Having done that, drivers will be convinced when they pay the ERP charges, and I think this is fair and reasonable. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Minister will take my suggestion seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our attempt to tackle slow traffic and congestion on the highways, I hope that the Minister will also consider converting the right lane into a high speed lane.&nbsp; This will mean that the speed limit for cars travelling on this lane will be 80 to 90 km per hour. For slow-moving vehicles, they will have to use the left lane. This policy has been implemented in Japan, China and other advanced countries.&nbsp; So far, the results have been good and traffic conditions have been smooth.&nbsp; Hence, I hope that LTA will consider carrying out this pilot scheme on the AYE and, if proven effective, we can further implement it on other highways so as to solve the slow traffic problems and congestion.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Matthias Yao Chih--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B>&nbsp; Mr Siew Kum Hong is not here.&nbsp; Mr Teo Ser Luck.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Ser Luck--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Road Signs</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Ser Luck:</B> Not too long ago, I received an email comparing the lighter sentence given to an offence for&nbsp;drink driving and getting a cyclist killed than one for sexual act.&nbsp; The writer expressed concern about the wrong message sent out and, more importantly, cyclists' safety on the road.&nbsp; Since then the writer and cycling committee came together under <p align=left>Column: 3571<p>the banner of \"Safe Cycling Task Force\".&nbsp;They have not stopped pedalling since and had discussions and meetings&nbsp;within the committee and the authorities.&nbsp; They knew that big bangs, such as asking for bike lanes, would not happen here for a while and chose to pedal slowly, hoping for progressive changes.&nbsp; I encourage them, \"Keep pedalling and don't apply the brakes, and to pedal at the speed that the authorities could keep up.\"&nbsp; So they proposed for more road signs for cyclists, closure of roads and more public education.&nbsp; But they seem to be pedalling on the same spot because there are not many changes on the road today.

The complaints are plenty and if you listen enough to them, you sometimes might lose your sense of perspective of what the larger picture really is.&nbsp; So if you look at surveys that have been done - the Public Transport Council conducts a&nbsp;Bus Satisfaction Survey every year -&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;2006, it was eight out of 10 who said that the overall service level, they are satisfied with it.&nbsp; This is an improvement.&nbsp; In 2005 it was seven in 10.&nbsp; So we should always bear this in mind.&nbsp; If we look at, say,&nbsp;international benchmarks, where do we stand?&nbsp; The International Union of Public Transport (UITP), in its 2006 \"Mobility in Cities Database\", had surveyed more than 50 cities and named Singapore, along with Vienna and Helsinki, as the top three cities with the most striking success in providing an efficient and enjoyable public transport system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public transport system was also ranked among the top four in terms of operating cost and affordability of fares to commuters.&nbsp; Recently,&nbsp;I met Mr Hans Rat, Secretary General of UITP, who was here&nbsp;on a visit&nbsp;to look at our public transport system, and he said:&nbsp;&nbsp;\"If public transport is a religion, Singapore will be a holy place.\"&nbsp; He said this is because we have a very good public transport system. &nbsp;So, as I said earlier, when it comes to public transport, let us keep it in perspective, let us keep the larger picture in view.&nbsp; We have a good public transport system but,<p align=left>Column: 3575<p> yes,&nbsp;there is room for improvement, and this is something that we must and will do to improve it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aim is to make public transport more attractive, no longer positioned as merely catering to a captive market, as Ms Sylvia Lim has said,&nbsp;of those who have no other means of transport, but to win over those who do not have alternatives.&nbsp; We must make public transport attractive to this group of \"non-customers\", so that significant numbers would choose public transport because they find it&nbsp;convenient, reliable and offering far better value for money than private transport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this,&nbsp;we have embarked on a slew of measures:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding our rail network;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Giving priority to our buses&nbsp;on our roads.&nbsp; So, bus will have priority on the road;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the quality of our buses and trains;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhancing the choices for our commuters;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Improving connectivity and accessibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have set ourselves a target of raising the public transport share of all morning peak-hour trips from the current 63% to at least 70% by 2020.&nbsp; To achieve this, it is important that we increase the density of our rail network. &nbsp;In most major cities that have a high public transport modal share, such as London, New York and Tokyo, the rail network - density and frequency&nbsp;- plays a critical role, as it is the most competitive alternative to the car in terms of speed, reliability and comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3576<p>We see this too in Singapore.&nbsp; Commuters surveyed in LTA's 2006 Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey gave the thumbs-up for the MRT.&nbsp; 94% of users surveyed were satisfied with MRT services.&nbsp; It scored well in critical attributes, such as travel time (94% were satisfied), reliability (93%) and station accessibility (93%).&nbsp; Looking ahead, and this is in answer to Mr Liang Eng Hwa, we will expand our MRT network.&nbsp; It&nbsp;is a key plank of our strategy to improve public transport journey times, to close the gap with private transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what can Singaporeans look forward to?&nbsp; The Circle Line will open from 2010 onwards, improving connectivity and reducing travel times.&nbsp; From Bishan to Paya Lebar, 30 minutes now. &nbsp;When the Circle Line is up and running, 17 minutes.&nbsp; For Bishan residents, an exciting night out at Holland Village will be less than 20 minutes away, while an&nbsp;evening stroll at the Botanic Gardens will be just two stops away from Bishan Station.&nbsp; The Circle Line will also help to spice up our city life by connecting people and places.&nbsp; For example, sports fans will be glad to know that after watching their favourite football team at the new Sports Hub, they can, if they wish, take a&nbsp;ride from the Stadium Station to the Mountbatten Station and&nbsp;have supper at Old Airport Road.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond this, the LTA is completing its feasibility studies for a new 33-station Downtown Line that will link the north western and the eastern parts of Singapore to the Marina Bay.&nbsp; When the Downtown Line is up, residents in Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, Bedok Reservoir and MacPherson can take the train to see, if they wish,&nbsp;the bright lights of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort.&nbsp; A trip from Bukit Panjang to the city centre that now takes 60 minutes will be shortened by one-third.&nbsp; A resident in the Bedok Reservoir area will no longer need to take a feeder bus to Bedok Central to<p align=left>Column: 3577<p> catch a train into the CBD.&nbsp; The Downtown Line will connect his home in the heartlands directly to the Marina Bay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Downtown Line, we are identifying other possible rail lines and extensions required to support Singapore's development to 2020 and beyond.&nbsp; As part of our long-term planning for a future Singapore of 6.5 million population, we expect that we will need to at least double our current rail network of 138 km for a 50% increase in population.&nbsp; That means building&nbsp;the equivalent of seven North-east Lines. &nbsp;Our expansion plans will bring the MRT to areas that are currently not well-served, enhance connectivity, reduce travel time, and relieve congestion on heavily-used MRT routes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other key measure, if we want to get more people to choose public transport, is to give greater priority to buses on the road, as this will improve the reliability of bus services and reduce delays.&nbsp; This we will do. &nbsp;For example, LTA had conducted a pilot on full day bus lane along Orchard Road in October 2005.&nbsp; Average bus speeds have improved, with non-peak speeds increasing by 10% on weekdays&nbsp;and 23% on Saturdays.&nbsp; Following this, the LTA will be extending the full day bus lane scheme next month to other areas in the CBD, namely Eu Tong Sen Street, Hill Street, Victoria Street, Bras Basah Road and Somerset Road, benefiting over 50,000 commuters on about 40 bus services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA is also looking at ensuring that buses are able to get out of bus bays without being impeded by other road-users.&nbsp; In some instances, widened roads with linear bus stops may be the right trade-off but, for others, bus bays, coupled with the right of way for buses to exit, may be the better approach.&nbsp; Like Mr Ong Kian Min, many members of the public have suggested that this right of<p align=left>Column: 3578<p> way be made mandatory, rather than as a matter of courtesy.&nbsp; LTA is currently studying this suggestion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Mr Ong Kian Min and others have cited problems of overcrowding on our buses and MRT, long waiting times for buses and long journey times on public transport.&nbsp; These are the top three concerns.&nbsp; I mentioned earlier about the PTC Bus Satisfaction Survey and these are&nbsp;the top three&nbsp;concerns.&nbsp; What is encouraging is that, if you look at the survey results and compare 2006 with 2005, it has improved - marginally, but it has improved. &nbsp;But I agree that these are important issues and we should&nbsp;tackle them head on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the two key measures of expanding our rail network and giving buses priority on our roads, we have also taken steps to ensure that the public transport operators themselves play their part in raising service standards.&nbsp; This is the point that Mdm Cynthia Phua brought up.&nbsp; It is an important point and it is something that we will be doing.&nbsp; Last year, the Public Transport Council (PTC) put in place a more stringent set of Quality of Service Standards (QoS) for basic bus services.&nbsp; This set of QoS Standards better reflects the travel experience of commuters and focuses on areas that are important to commuters: overcrowding, waiting time and journey time.&nbsp; For example, one of the standards that had been tightened was that at least 85% of total trips on each bus service should depart the bus interchange and terminals not more than five minutes from its scheduled headway on a daily basis.&nbsp; This will help improve the timeliness of buses arriving at bus stops and reduce waiting times.&nbsp; Over time, through continual refinement of the QoS Standards, the PTC aims to raise the bar for public transport operators and improve the reliability, journey time and waiting times for buses, while ensuring affordable fares.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3579<p> As for concerns on overcrowding on our MRT trains, LTA's audit shows that the passenger loading at the busiest MRT stations, such as Toa Payoh and Kallang during the morning peak, is about 1400 passengers per train, or about 80% of the train&rsquo;s passenger capacity.&nbsp; This is nothing like the morning commuter crush in Tokyo.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Seah Kian Peng alluded to this.&nbsp; I visited Tokyo recently and I went to the Shinjuku station.&nbsp; Very busy during the morning peak, and you see long lines of people but all very orderly.&nbsp; And they go into the trains and they pack themselves in, shoulder to shoulder.&nbsp; And I was told that this&nbsp;was already an improvement.&nbsp; In the past, they had white-gloved attendants&nbsp;whose job is to pack them even more, push them in.&nbsp; But they have stopped that now because of their greying population.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;I would like to assure this House that the Japanese standard of loading is not something that we aspire to.&nbsp;&nbsp;So Seah Kian Peng does not need to have nightmares that, in Singapore, we intend to pack people into the MRT trains like sardines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To experience for myself the crowding situation on our trains, I recently visited Toa Payoh MRT station during the morning peak period.&nbsp; I was told that this is the peak of peaks,&nbsp;when the&nbsp;Toa Payoh station is the busiest.&nbsp; When I tried to board the south-bound train at about 8.00 am, it was indeed difficult to get in at first, because passengers were crowding at the train doors.&nbsp; But once you get through that and move&nbsp; to the centre of the train, it was much better. &nbsp;I noticed that some&nbsp;of the commuters&nbsp;had enough space&nbsp;to read their newspapers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I agree with Mr Liang Eng Hwa that improvements should be made, where feasible.&nbsp; SMRT is upgrading 66 of its trains over the next two years. &nbsp;This upgrading, which includes a&nbsp; redesigned interior layout to allow smoother passenger flow, will improve the comfort level of commuters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3580<p> I agree with Dr Lam Pin Min that travel information, including real-time information, such as bus arrival times, can help commuters make more informed travel decisions, as well as better manage waiting time and transfers.&nbsp; Dr Lam would be happy to know that LTA is working closely with both bus operators to roll out a system that will display real-time bus information of both operators&rsquo; services at selected bus stops.&nbsp; LTA actually conducted a previous trial on such a service.&nbsp; It ended in 2003 because of technological constraints and costs.&nbsp; Since then, the technology has improved, with the public transport operators having now developed operational systems which facilitate the provision of real-time information.&nbsp; The current trial, which begins from the middle of this year, will complement PTO's efforts, such as SBST&rsquo;s \"iris Next Bus\" initiative, which provides real-time bus arrival information through mobile phones and the SBST website.&nbsp; In addition, LTA has provided funding support for TransitLink to develop an electronic bus journey planner so that commuters will be able to find out various ways of getting from A to B, using the bus services provided by the two public transport operators.&nbsp; This journey planner is part of our on-going efforts to ensure that services are seamless and integrated across different operators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lam, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mr Lim Biow Chuan also suggested having&nbsp;real-time information for motorists, such as a dedicated radio channel for traffic news.&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, LTA keep motorists updated through the one.motoring website, EMAS message signs, travel time displays and radio broadcasts. So, for the example which Mr Lim Biow Chuan gave, that by the time&nbsp;he saw the EMAS information, he was already close to the CTE tunnel, I would suggest that he switch on&nbsp;the radio while driving. There is constant feed on the radio when&nbsp;you switch it on and&nbsp;you will get the feed-in.&nbsp; LTA will continue, <p align=left>Column: 3581<p>however, to enhance the existing platforms, and continue to explore new platforms where feasible and effective, including learning from best practices overseas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was in Japan, they have this system where they provide not just journey planning, but tell you where are the areas which are congested.&nbsp; But it is very expensive; it is a private and public initiative, where they have car manufacturers&nbsp;to be involved in this. This is one service that they have and LTA will start to explore things like this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also expanding the number of public transport choices available to commuters. I agree with Mr Cedric Foo that we should facilitate premium bus services for commuters who want a more direct and comfortable ride.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Transport Council (PTC) recently simplified its premium bus service guidelines to encourage operators to provide more services.&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to Mr Cedric Foo, COE-exempted buses, such as school buses or other omnibuses, can be used to operate premium bus services under the guidelines. It has been simplified. Barely two weeks after the revision, the PTC received more than 40 new applications, compared to an average of about one application per month previously.&nbsp; It is still early days to take stock of the revision, but we can be encouraged by the interest shown by the bus operators so far.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min made the point that premium bus services should be expanded to cater to those living in the HDB estates.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform him that the PTC is currently considering a number of applications for services originating from HDB towns to the CBD area.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 3582<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Ong Kian Min and Mr Wee Siew Kim have also raised various suggestions on the public transport industry structure, including allowing buses and trains to compete, as well as allowing more competitors, such as mini-buses, to enter the market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the premium bus services scheme, we are already allowing more competition on a limited basis, as such bus services can run along existing MRT and basic bus&nbsp;routes.&nbsp; Beyond this scheme, we are looking hard at the fundamental public transport industry structure&nbsp;and related competition issues, to see how we can make our public transport system more efficient and integrated, while giving commuters more choices.&nbsp; We have commissioned a consultancy study to give us further inputs and insights on these issues, and these will be incorporated into the on-going land transport review.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim brought up the issue of the listed status of the public transport companies.&nbsp; I think she raised the point that&nbsp;because they are listed companies and have&nbsp;shareholders to answer to, they need to earn an adequate return. This might make them less efficient and less customer-centric.&nbsp; But I would be slow in coming to that conclusion because if you look at the weight of evidence, it is a fact that the public transport operators have a profit motive and profit incentive, and have to meet adequate returns that incentivise them to be efficient, innovative and customer-centric.&nbsp; If we look at countries that have not done so, where&nbsp;the public transport operations are run by the State, you will find that the&nbsp;weight of evidence is that they end up with higher costs, less efficient, and over time, service levels go down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also enhancing the connectivity and accessibility of our public transport system. As it is, our public transport system already has a high level<p align=left>Column: 3583<p> of connectivity and can be accessed easily. There is a bus stop&nbsp;within 400 metres radius of&nbsp; most residential developments, with services that connect commuters to all parts of the island.&nbsp; 67% of commuters take five minutes or less to walk to the bus-stop or MRT station, and 93% take 10 minutes or less.&nbsp; We are also integrating our MRT stations and bus interchanges with building developments, enhancing convenience&nbsp;and connectivity. We have seen such improvements at Toa Payoh and we will bring in the concept to the new Ang Mo Kio Bus Interchange which will be ready by mid-2007. When it is ready, commuters will be able to pick up groceries on their way home from work, take a break in between transfers or do some shopping at the numerous lifestyle boutiques.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I agree with Mr Ong Kian Min that we must do more to improve connectivity, and in particular, improve the walking experience.&nbsp; Walking is an essential part of the public transport journey and we should take into account our tropical, humid weather and sudden downpours. I think Mr Ong Kian Min referred to it as the freaky weather, ie, when you go out, and there is a sudden downpour, you get wet and it is a dampener for people to use the public transport system.&nbsp; While we cannot change our weather, we can ameliorate its effects. As such, we have decided that current programme of building sheltered walkways and covers over pedestrian overhead bridges should be accelerated, and this will be dovetailed with HDB's covered linkway programme in the housing estates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Cedric Foo, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Seah Kian Peng that even as we strive to develop a first-rate public transport system, we must ensure that we make it accessible to all, including the less well-off in our society.&nbsp; The PTC will continue to ensure that fares remain<p align=left>Column: 3584<p> affordable to the general commuting public.&nbsp; Our public transport fares are among the most affordable internationally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we do recognise that more would need to be done to help lower-income households in their public transport expenses.&nbsp; The correct way to help them is not through suppressing fare increases, but to find ways to help the lower-income households directly.&nbsp; For a start, the Government has put $10 million into the Public Transport Fund to be used over three years. A portion of the funds can be used to help low-income households cope if there is a fare increase in October 2007, to alleviate the immediate impact of the fare increase. We will also look at other longer-term measures to help such households cope with rising transport cost through this Fund and other measures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, on the issue of accessibility, Ms Lee Bee Wah has proposed that senior citizen concession hours be extended because more senior citizens are returning to the job market.&nbsp; Senior citizen concessionary travel granted by the public transport operations is a form of cross-subsidy&nbsp;by other full-fare paying adults.&nbsp; The more extensive it is, the higher the fares would be for others. Hence, the operators have to take this into account in extending concessions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the operators have taken in feedback and have been extending the concession hours for senior citizens over the years, most recently, in 2005.&nbsp; I think they will take into account what Ms Lee Bee Wah said as they will need to constantly review this matter as part of their business plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Ms Lee Bee Wah that we take seriously the safety of the public at the MRT stations. We have various safety measures in place.&nbsp; There are signages at the trackside to advise commuters not to stand beyond the yellow line; Emergency Train Stop<p align=left>Column: 3585<p> plungers at all platforms and Passenger Service Centres, and CCTVs to monitor the crowd situation. The train operators carry out public education on MRT safety and deploy staff to patrol station platforms and assist commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to assure her that LTA and SMRT continually take into account various suggestions to enhance safety, including the proposal to install half-height platform screen doors.&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah brought up the example of Hong Kong and the amount of money they spent on that. I visited Hong Kong recently.&nbsp; I met the operators and I asked them.&nbsp; Most of the money they spent was to put up platform doors for their underground stations.&nbsp; In Singapore, we already have that throughout the whole MRT system.&nbsp; For the above ground, only four stations because of the costs.&nbsp; How did they deal with the costs?&nbsp; They passed it to the commuters.&nbsp; Ten-cent increase in&nbsp;fares because of the platform screen doors.&nbsp; But the point she made, that in assessing this, we should also take into account the disruption caused to the MRT system, is a valid point, and this is something that LTA is reviewing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, ensuring safety is a shared responsibility.&nbsp; LTA and SMRT will play their part but so too should commuters take responsibility for their personal safety. The open platform at MRT stations is no different from public roads where commuters exercise personal caution by&nbsp;standing not too close to the edge and look out for traffic.&nbsp; Likewise, for commuters at MRT stations, they should stand behind the yellow lines while waiting for the trains.&nbsp; Shared responsibility is&nbsp;the principal way to minimise accidents because even if we put in the half-height platform screen doors, this cannot be a 100% guarantee as a foolproof way against&nbsp;future mishap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3586<p> Mdm Cynthia Phua asked about adopting open standards for ez-link card system and when LTA would divest ownership of its subsidiary company, EZ-Link. When the ez-link system was introduced in 2002, the current proprietary system was chosen because it was a proven technology which had already been implemented in Hong Kong.&nbsp; LTA is currently upgrading the system to adopt open standards for its ticket payment infrastructure, which will allow other card suppliers and managers into the market and potentially, like she said, lower cost for commuters.&nbsp; This is expected to be ready when the Circle Line opens around 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Phua that the role of the card manager, which entails the sale, distribution and management of the ez-link cards, is best performed by a private company.&nbsp; LTA's ownership of ez-link is only meant to be transitional. LTA is looking into the divestment of this company and any divestment will be done in an open and transparent manner.&nbsp; With the introduction of the regulatory framework for ticket payments and services last year, the PTC is also able to impose licence conditions to prevent card managers, such as ez-link, from levying unreasonable charges on commuters or engaging in any anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ong Kian Min has highlighted taxi services and the need to better match supply and demand, particularly during peak periods.&nbsp; Fundamentally, when there is an imbalance, either the price or quantity will change. He cited Hong Kong as an example where there is no difficulty in getting a taxi even at peak periods. As I have mentioned, I visited Hong Kong recently and I met up with their taxi operators and taxi regulators. I asked them what is the secret. They said that there is no secret,&nbsp;there is an excess supply situation in Hong Kong.&nbsp; So why is it that&nbsp;when you walk out, you can get a <p align=left>Column: 3587<p>taxi?&nbsp; Because they have an excess supply.&nbsp; The taxis are waiting for the commuters.&nbsp; But this comes at a cost.&nbsp; When I talked to the taxi associations, they said that it comes with high cost because the taxi drivers in Hong Kong are having an even more difficult time making ends meet than in Singapore. So, if we were to adopt this approach, Mr Seng Han Thong would have concerns, as he is already worried about whether deregulation will lead to more taxis on the road.&nbsp; It is important when we are dealing with transport issues, not to take a NIMBY (not in my backyard) approach&nbsp;- which simply shifts the impact&nbsp;to others, in this case, taxi drivers, by having an excess supply of taxis in Singapore which will result in lower fares and lower income for taxi drivers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach we have taken is to let the market determine the balance of all these three different interests&nbsp;- taxi passengers, taxi drivers and taxi operators.&nbsp; By liberalising the taxi industry, market forces determine the supply of taxi services and encourage competition within the taxi industry to improve taxi services for the benefit of taxi drivers and commuters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The liberalisation has seen the entry of three new companies and an increase in taxi supply to better meet commuters' needs. Competition among the companies has spurred&nbsp;them to improve their services and provide more choices for the commuters through differentiated services, such as limousine services as well as in niche areas like the medical chaperon and drink jockey services.&nbsp; Furthermore, competition among the taxi companies has also benefited taxi drivers, as the companies need to put together attractive taxi rental packages, and work hard to attract and retain drivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The role of the Government in this liberalised market is to facilitate its workings and ensure that taxi service<p align=left>Column: 3588<p> standards are not compromised. For instance, to ensure that commuters can get a taxi if they choose to phone-book a taxi, LTA has, with effect from January 2007, extended the monitoring period on taxi companies call booking performances from between 5 pm and 8 pm to between 5 pm and 11 pm under the Quality of Service (QoS) standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA is also working with various stakeholders in this&nbsp;-&nbsp;like Ngee Ann City -&nbsp;you may have read in the newspapers.&nbsp;They are working with the operators at Ngee Ann City to try to de-conflict the traffic near the taxi stand there, improve the throughput of the road leading to Ngee Ann City and also talk to the taxi companies to get more taxis into Ngee Ann City during the peak period.&nbsp; This shared approach is very important.&nbsp; We need all the stakeholders to play their part. There has been some feedback which ask us&nbsp;why do we not put up call booking information on taxi stands.&nbsp; It is sensible because, firstly, not everybody who goes to a taxi stand and wants to make a booking&nbsp;will know the number.&nbsp; Or what about tourists? They may not know the number. So LTA has been working to put up this information at taxi stands, shopping centres and major buildings and also to get shopping centres to work with them.&nbsp; So, if you are a tourist or someone who needs to make&nbsp;a booking, you go to the information counter which will put the booking through for you, as in some countries.&nbsp; We need everybody to play their part to do this.&nbsp; Some shopping centres and developments asked why they should do this, as this is free advertising for the taxi companies. As I have said, everybody needs to play their part in order to raise the quality of our taxi service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to hear from Mr Seng Han Thong that the taxi associations have come together to discuss how to move <p align=left>Column: 3589<p>the taxi industry forward.&nbsp; I look forward to receiving the report and we will study it very carefully.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to our strategy to manage and optimise our road use.&nbsp; Many of you would have noticed that the traffic on our roads has gone heavier, especially in the past few years, despite building more roads and highways.&nbsp; Why is it so?&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa was absolutely spot-on in his speech.&nbsp; He says the reason why this is so is because from 1997 to 2004, our road capacity grew by 5%, the&nbsp;car population grew by twice as much, by 10%, and daily car trips went up by even more,&nbsp; 23%.&nbsp; To address this problem effectively, I agree with Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Seng Han Thong, Mr Lim Biow Chuan and Mr&nbsp;Liang Eng Hwa that we need to adopt a holistic, multi-pronged approach to ensure a sustainable land transport system for a growing city.&nbsp; ERP alone would not be effective. And as I mentioned previously in this House, there is no single solution to land transport problem. So the Government has never relied on ERP alone. It has always taken an integrated approach dealing with this urban transport issue. So we need to complement ERP with proper land use and transport planning, a good road network and traffic management system including the use, as Mr Lim Biow Chuan said, of an intelligent transport system (ITS) such as GLIDE to maximise road capacity and continue to improve our public transport.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On vehicle growth, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Seng Han Thong asked about my Ministry&rsquo;s policy, going forward.&nbsp; Our vehicle quota system provides for the vehicle population to grow at a pace which can be sustained by our road infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vehicle population growth rate has been set at 3% per annum until quota year 2008, which ends in April 2009.&nbsp; We will do a review in<p align=left>Column: 3590<p> 2008 to set the long-term directions on vehicle growth. For the quota year 2007 beginning in May, the LTA will be issuing a total COE quota of 127,021.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we continue to allow 3% annual vehicle growth, our current vehicle population of 800,000 would increase by about 50% to about 1.2 million by 2020.&nbsp; On the other hand, our road capacity is expected to increase by about 9%-12% over the same period. If you were to line up all these 1.2 million vehicles&nbsp;bumper to bumper, it would fill up our existing expressways 5 times over!&nbsp; And if you were to line it up the other way,&nbsp;the&nbsp;1.2 million vehicles&nbsp;will go all the way to Beijing!&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that the current 3% annual growth rate cannot be maintained indefinitely, given our land constraint and a slower pace of road-building, as Singapore&nbsp; is becoming more built up. Already, some 12% of our land is used for transport, which is the same as that used for industry, and almost the same as&nbsp;housing which is&nbsp;15%.&nbsp; The tradeoffs associated with higher vehicle population growth are real, because of competing demands on land use as well as the impact on the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, simply building more roads will not solve our transport problems in a sustainable way because the demand for road space just keeps growing unless it is sensibly restrained.&nbsp; If we do not wish our city to resemble a giant carpark lot, we will need, apart from moderating vehicle growth, to continually review our ERP coverage to ensure smooth-flowing roads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I assure Mr Lim Biow Chuan that LTA's approach is indeed to consider and exhaust traffic engineering solutions such as road-widening before imposing ERP.&nbsp; This had been done for the CTE and, even now, the LTA is working on a project to widen the CTE stretch between Ang Mo Kio Ave 1&nbsp;and Ang Mo Kio Ave 3.&nbsp; Likewise, to relieve the<p align=left>Column: 3591<p> evening congestion on the ECP, the LTA is re-marking the stretch between Fort Road and Marina South to add one more lane in either direction.&nbsp; But the fact remains that the ERP is a necessary tool in our traffic management toolbox.&nbsp; It has helped to keep speeds on our expressways such as the CTE above 45 km/h and on our arterial roads above 20 km/h.&nbsp; Had we not introduced ERP, we would probably be facing gridlock on our key roads and expressways now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ang Mong Seng has suggested that we dedicate the rightmost lane of the expressway for vehicles travelling at 90 km/h and the remaining lanes for vehicles travelling below 90 km/h.&nbsp; Today, the ERP system is designed to allow maximum traffic throughput on our roads by keeping vehicle speeds within the optimal speed range of 45 to 65 km/h. To demarcate one lane for vehicles to travel at 90 km/h will not allow us to maximise the use of our road space. Moreover, it is likely that the sheer number of cars that will want to go into the fast lane will simply congest the fast lane in no time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Biow Chuan highlighted the transport needs of the residents in the Northeast.&nbsp; Residents, like Ms Karen Lee,&nbsp;wrote to&nbsp;<I>Today</I> recently on her journeys on the CTE and its alternatives, highlighting the congestion that she and her husband encountered on their&nbsp;drive to work from Punggol to Buona Vista, the place where her husband works.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me highlight the various measures we are taking to help Ms Lee and other Northeast residents.&nbsp; Firstly&nbsp;- the CTE.&nbsp; LTA aims to complete the widening of the CTE stretch between Ang Mo Kio Ave 1&nbsp;and Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, which I mentioned earlier, by end 2008, which will relieve the congestion there.&nbsp; Secondly, when the KPE, ie, the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway, is fully open by 2008, it will provide Ms Lee and her husband with an additional expressway<p align=left>Column: 3592<p> link from the Northeast to the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we are improving the public transport options.&nbsp; When the Circle Line opens, the journey from Punggol to Buona Vista&nbsp;will take about 35 minutes, compared to the current 45-minute journey on the North-east Line.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Cedric Foo asked for a clarification on my Ministry's position on car ownership costs.&nbsp; There is no change to our approach, which is to gradually reduce ownership costs so as to strike a better balance between the ownership and usage costs of a car.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn now to our strategy to meet the diverse needs of a more complex society. I agree with Ms Lee Bee Wah, Mdm Cynthia Phua and Mr Wee Siew Kim that our transport system needs to keep pace with changing demographics, including a greying population, as well as support our efforts to build an inclusive society.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We now have Wheelchair Accessible Buses (WABs) plying five bus routes.&nbsp; SBST will introduce more this year. The WABs are making a difference.&nbsp; Take Mr Hui Nai Wai, for instance.&nbsp; He&nbsp;is a regular user of&nbsp; these WABs.&nbsp; He makes at least four&nbsp;trips a week. Previously, he had to telephone for a private ambulance costing $50.&nbsp; Now with the WAB, he says, for the price of the ticket, he&nbsp;and his family can go from his home in&nbsp;Eunos to attend church, go shopping at Mustafa Centre or look for places to eat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Lee Bee Wah has also suggested that we consider installing escalators for pedestrians overhead bridges near MRT stations. She said do not just talk about cost. But&nbsp;cost is important, as&nbsp;Members know, because money does not&nbsp;grow on trees. So we have to look at the cost, but I agree with&nbsp;her&nbsp;that you do not just look at the cost, you have got to look at the benefit,&nbsp;and this is something that we will do.&nbsp; We will look at the cost, we will look <p align=left>Column: 3593<p>at the benefit, we will look at the traffic flow at a particular MRT station and, where it is feasible, LTA will consider it.&nbsp; In fact, for the elderly and the&nbsp;less mobile, what they prefer are not escalators. They prefer more at-grade crossings.&nbsp; At-grade crossings mean more street crossings which&nbsp;are much easier for them. And this is something that LTA will look at providing more -&nbsp;more traffic light crossings at road level at suitable locations, wherever possible. In estates where there is a higher concentration of elderly, the traffic light timings would also be adjusted to allow the elderly more time to cross the pedestrian crossing safely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach is to study what are practical and impactful ways to roll out more barrier-free facilities to make our transport system more accessible.&nbsp; Last December, I asked LTA to conduct a pilot project to install barrier-free facilities for the route between Simei MRT station and the Changi General Hospital. Following the trial, the LTA has embarked on a programme to implement barrier-free routes within a 400-metre radius of all MRT stations.&nbsp; This programme, together with other nation-wide barrier-free upgrading works, will take place over the next&nbsp;five years and cost $60 million in all.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another initiative that we are pursuing is to provide additional lifts for our MRT stations. While our MRT stations have generally been provided with one entrance lift each, LTA is currently reviewing whether more lifts are required at some stations to ensure that our less mobile elderly citizens can access our trains more conveniently.&nbsp; Because I have received feedback, and I agree with this feedback, that it does not really make logical sense for the less mobile&nbsp;commuters to make long detours&nbsp;and cross major roads in order&nbsp;to use the entrances with lifts while the more able-bodied are required to walk less.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3594<p> Mr Teo Ser Luck asked if we could look into the needs of cyclists.&nbsp; In principle, yes, because cyclists, along with pedestrians and others, also share the road space with motorists and public transport vehicles.&nbsp; All these diverse groups will need to find ways to accommodate one another&rsquo;s transportation needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Teo asked us to consider the proposals put forward by the Safe Cycling Task Force, such as providing road signs along routes commonly used by cyclists.&nbsp; The LTA is in touch with the group, and will work with MCYS, his Ministry, and the cycling enthusiasts to explore measures to enhance the safety of cyclists, perhaps through the placing of information signs to forewarn motorists of popular cycling routes.&nbsp; LTA will also continue to work with the Traffic Police and event organisers to allow road space to be used for special cycling events and sports activities such as the NUS Triathlon, while minimising the impact and inconvenience to other road users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, Sir, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked about the impact of Malaysia's proposed closure of the Causeway to heavy goods vehicles and the diversion of these vehicles to the Second Link.&nbsp; In answer to Mr Lim Biow Chuan's query, we were informed by the Malaysian Government that the closure would be temporary. The proposed diversion will have material implications for both Singapore and Malaysia. Besides the obvious operational adjustments for traffic and checkpoint operations at the Second Link and the Causeway, users of both land links can expect delays and higher costs as a result of the proposed diversion. Therefore, we have formally conveyed to the Malaysian Government that it will be necessary for Malaysia and Singapore to work together to minimise the disruption to the travelling public as well as its impact on tourist and trade flows.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3595<p> My Ministry has written to the Malaysian Ministry of Works to propose convening a Joint Committee to manage the temporary diversion, comprising relevant Ministries and agencies on both sides.&nbsp; On Singapore's part, a multi-agency group led by my Ministry has already started looking into what is needed to minimise the impact of the temporary diversion. To deal with the anticipated increase in traffic volume at the Second Link, ICA and LTA are making preparations to redeploy resources and adjust traffic flows at the checkpoints.&nbsp; We have also been seeking feedback from industry on how to mitigate the impact of the diversion on their operations.&nbsp; However, we will need to coordinate our efforts with our Malaysian counterparts in order to ensure that the measures taken are effective in minimising disruption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are no easy answers to the land transport challenges which we face.&nbsp; It is always a matter of balance. Difficult trade-offs would have to be made. We are quite clear in our minds that when we make these trade-offs, we cannot please everybody. But whatever we do, we need to do what we think is right rather than what is popular, taking into account different perspectives and priorities, but, at the end of the day, settling on directions which best serve Singaporeans today and in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year ahead, we will continue to work on a roadmap which will shape what the land transport system would look like in the year 2020, and, more importantly, lay the foundations for a land transport system that is sustainable for future generations of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we started the review, we have received many suggestions from the public which have helped us to make improvements and given us much food for thought. Let me just cite one example. Mr Bruno Wildermuth, a long-time resident of<p align=left>Column: 3596<p> Singapore, wrote to me and suggested that in our traffic impact assessment of major property developments, we should also take into account the impact on public transport. Right now, we look at the impact on traffic flows and road congestion in general, but not particularly on the impact on public transport. We will now do so.&nbsp; I thank him and others for writing to us and I would encourage them to continue to give us their feedback.&nbsp; Like Mr Seah Kian Peng, I firmly believe that such views will make the outcomes more robust and relevant to the commuting public and our key stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further engage the various transport stakeholders including members of the public, we will hold focus group discussions in the next few months to get suggestions and feedback on some of the key issues and long-term challenges for our land transport policies.&nbsp; Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, my Minister of State, together with members from the Transport GPC will lead this effort. We will consider all views and suggestions received in our review. Moving forward, we will continue with this consultative approach in developing and implementing land transport policy and plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our vision for a world-class land transport system ensues from, and must support, the overarching vision of what Singapore is to be - a vibrant jewel of a city, with a quality living and working environment, and an inclusive society. Our land transport system will play a critical role in realising this national vision, by connecting Singaporeans, catalysing economic activity and spurring the growth of a vibrant Singapore.&nbsp; To do this, we must anticipate, change and respond to greater demand for travel and see through the eyes of the commuting public.&nbsp; This is our ambition. And we will know that we have succeeded when our land transport system is regarded in the same league as our airport and our seaport.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The Singapore-Kuala Lumpur sector is an anomaly.&nbsp; People flows between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore are strong but yet the sector is served by a shuttle service with only SIA and MAS as operators.&nbsp; It is perhaps the only major route that is not served by budget airlines.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister when this route can be liberalised and when budget airlines can start serving this market.&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wee Siew Kim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Much hinges on the success of the airports, and it is prudent to constantly watch the threats of emerging regional airports.&nbsp; One key element&nbsp;to maintain Changi Airport's competitiveness is&nbsp;a liberalising aviation regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much talk about the air talks between Malaysia and Singapore.&nbsp; The competitive field is constrained by both the current limits on flights and the limitation of carriers.&nbsp; This sector has not gained from the benefits that LCCs have brought about in other areas.&nbsp; In these <p align=left>Column: 3598<p>other areas, consumers are spoilt for choice.&nbsp; Additionally, air transportation becomes an option available to a larger group of travellers.&nbsp; Wider afield, there is also the ASEAN target of having open skies between the capital cities.&nbsp; Can the Minister give us an update of the developments on these two fronts and also the benefits that would accrue to Singapore as a result of such liberalisation?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Aviation Sector</I> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to talk about incentives for growth of aircraft fleet and the aviation sector.&nbsp; I noted the success with the shipowners in the maritime sector.&nbsp; The incentive scheme, like the Approved International Shipping Enterprise Scheme, has reaped substantial recurring benefits to the port and supporting ancillary services.&nbsp; The success of the maritime scheme is evident from the substantial increase in the number of Singapore-flagged vessels.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister to consider studying the impact similar incentives would have for the aviation sector if they are offered to aircraft owners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, developments in aviation&nbsp;technology would see much lower cost of ownership of aircraft and thereby possibly making the private ownership of aircraft available to a wider spectrum of people.&nbsp; One such development is the advent of the very light jets - the VLJs and air taxis in the US.&nbsp; With these technological and business model developments, coupled with the emergence of open skies between ASEAN capital cities, we can expect new exciting growth.&nbsp; Could the Minister consider what proactive steps the Ministry and its agencies, like the CAAS, could take, including revamping its rules, processes and guidelines to ensure that Singapore's air entry points of Changi, the Budget Terminal and Seletar do not lose out to the regional aspirants?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 3599<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Now that the ALPS has been up and running for several years, I would like to hear from the Minister if the goals expected from the ALPS investment have been met, and whether the users -&nbsp;freight forwarders,&nbsp;logistics companies,&nbsp;airlines and&nbsp;customers - are happy with <p align=left>Column: 3600<p>what Singapore is offering at ALPS.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Hub Port</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min:</B> Mr Chairman, Singapore ranks among the top international maritime centres of the world.&nbsp; Singapore's standing rests on its status as a hub port.&nbsp; It is the world's busiest in terms of shipping tonnage, with 1.3 billion gross tonnes handled in 2006, and containerised traffic with 24.8 million, 20 foot equivalent units handled in 2006.&nbsp; In terms of cargo tonnage, Singapore is ranked second behind Shanghai with 449 million tonnes handled.&nbsp; Excellent connectivity is also one of the strengths of the Singapore port.&nbsp; However, Singapore continues to embrace challenges such as stiff competition from the region, especially China,&nbsp;limited land for future berth development and perennial threat of pirate attacks in the Straits of Malacca.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how would the above challenges affect Singapore's bid to maintain its hub-port status and what are the long-term strategies in enhancing the port performance and venturing into new business areas to stay ahead.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the hub-port, Singapore has also been promoting itself as a centre for shipping and maritime services.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister for an update on this area.&nbsp; With a thriving maritime industry set to grow in the range of 6% to 9% over the median term, is there a maritime manpower development and recruitment plan to meet the projected manpower needs of the industry?&nbsp; Did the 21-episode MediaCorp Mandarin serial entitled \"The Peak\" or \"<I>Zui Gao Dian</I> \", with a star-studded cast including Christopher Lee, Jeanette Aw, Elvin Ng and Qi Yuwu, achieve this objective of<p align=left>Column: 3601<p> attracting young Singaporeans to take up the glamorous, challenging and rewarding careers in this industry?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State for Transport (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua):</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, I thank Mr Cedric Foo and Dr Lam Pin Min for the questions on the maritime sector.&nbsp; I will now provide an update on our performance as well as what the Ministry&nbsp;is doing&nbsp;to ensure Singapore's continued competitiveness as a global hub port and maritime centre.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, indeed, as Dr Lam Pin Min has mentioned, Singapore's port continued to perform strongly in 2006 and occupied pole position globally in terms of container throughput, shipping tonnage and other measures.&nbsp; As Mr Cedric Foo has pointed out, other ports in Asia, especially China, have also been flourishing in tandem with the strong economic growth.&nbsp; For the past five years, Shanghai and Shenzhen have been growing at&nbsp;a blistering 15% to 30% per year.&nbsp; In 2006, these two ports were the third and fourth busiest container ports in the world.&nbsp; Indeed, as Mr Cedric Foo has pointed out, at the rate the Chinese ports are growing, it will only be a matter of time before one or both of them displace Singapore from her position as the busiest container port.&nbsp; But, Sir, this is not a zero sum game.&nbsp; The strong growth of the Chinese ports has also benefited Singapore.&nbsp; Over the last five years, containers shipped to and from China through Singapore grew by an average of 22% per year.&nbsp; As Chinese ports grow, so too can and will ours, and we intend to remain a hub port.&nbsp;Let me just highlight four ways to ensure we stay competitive and in the game.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must have sufficient capacity to cater to the rising demand.&nbsp; Ongoing works to expand Pasir Panjang Terminal by 16 berths to a total of 38 will meet our needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3602<p>Second, we need to sharpen our edge in efficiency and quality.&nbsp; For example, a reputation for quality is important to a bunker or ship refuelling port.&nbsp; Last year, the Maritime and Port Authority introduced a new standard on quality management through the bunker supply chain.&nbsp; This helps to reinforce our position as the world's top bunker port.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we need to be on the lookout for new growth opportunities.&nbsp; For example, in order to take advantage of the shifting auto-manufacturing trends, PSA has decided to develop a dedicated car transshipment terminal, complete with a purpose-built&nbsp;car storage facility, to capture the growing market for global car transshipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must ensure safe, unimpeded passage for ships passing through the sea lanes to Singapore.&nbsp; We have thus given much attention to improving the piracy situation in regional waters, including the Straits of Malacca.&nbsp; The Information Sharing Centre, launched by Singapore and 13 other Asian countries last November under the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships in Asia, or ReCAAP for short, will support inter-governmental action against piracy through better sharing and analysis of piracy data.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's development as an international maritime centre goes beyond the port terminal operations.&nbsp; Mr Cedric Foo and Dr Lam Pin Min have asked for updates.&nbsp; The strong growth in Asian trade and major expansion of the world's shipping fleet present excellent opportunities for Singapore to establish itself not just as a hub port but also as a base for shipping and maritime services.&nbsp; There is increasing demand for ancillary services such as ship financing, maritime legal services and marine insurance.&nbsp; As a maritime and aviation hub, an established financial centre,&nbsp;with&nbsp;a well-regarded legal<p align=left>Column: 3603<p> system, Singapore is well positioned to take advantage of the cluster opportunities available.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our incentive schemes have already met with very positive response.&nbsp; The Approved International&nbsp;Shipping Enterprise (or AIS) Scheme has attracted over 80 ship operating and ship-owning companies to date, generating some $2.8 billion of annual spending.&nbsp; The Maritime Finance Incentive (or MFI) introduced just last year to promote alternative ship finance structures has already been awarded to four companies with more than US$900 million worth of shipping assets portfolio.&nbsp; More proposals are in the pipeline.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are also constantly enhancing our schemes. As mentioned by Mr Cedric Foo in this year's Budget,&nbsp;the Approved Shipping Logistics Enterprise (or ASL) Scheme has also been enhanced and GST for servicing, sale and lease of containers used for international trade has been zero-rated.&nbsp; By building a conducive environment for maritime services in Singapore, we are increasingly being recognised as a choice location for major shipping groups from all over the world to base their operations in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is estimated that today, shipping and maritime services companies employ about 14,000 people in Singapore.&nbsp; Many of these jobs are well-paying white-collar jobs with good prospects, jobs which present excellent careers for Singaporeans.&nbsp; For example, shipbrokers are known to offer a starting pay from $1,800 to $3,000 for polytechnic graduates.&nbsp; A good, experienced broker can command a monthly salary of about $10,000 to $15,000. And I am told that the sector is doing so well and supply is so tight that some of them have been receiving bonuses as high as six to&nbsp;10 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunities are not confined to those with shipping-related qualifications.&nbsp; The industry needs university and polytechnic graduates with qualifications<p align=left>Column: 3604<p> in business, law, finance, engineering, and so on.&nbsp; However, despite the buoyancy enjoyed by the industry and the demand for manpower, Singaporeans' awareness of opportunities in the maritime services is still very low.&nbsp; Whenever I meet shipping and maritime services companies, it is not uncommon for them to praise Singapore as a wonderful location for their business, but lament the difficulty in recruiting people.&nbsp; Raising awareness of career opportunities in maritime services is therefore a key priority for us, and publicity efforts include the ones that Dr Lam has just mentioned - the recently concluded&nbsp; Mandarin TV serial \"The Peak\", and two TV commercials featuring the maritime industry.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

I would therefore encourage Singaporeans to take advantage of these initiatives to learn more about careers in the maritime services sector.&nbsp; An excellent career awaits them.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B> Mr Chairman, Sir, Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Wee Siew Kim have asked about our plans to ensure that Changi Airport stays ahead of the competitors.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Changi's success is founded on&nbsp;four key strategies: developing hardware and infrastructure, enhancing Changi's <p align=left>Column: 3605<p>software, anchoring the airlines in Changi, and liberalising the aviation regime.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on developing hardware and infrastructure,&nbsp;we will continue our forward-looking policy of building airport infrastructure ahead of future demand.&nbsp; When Terminal 3 opens next year, Changi's handling capacity will increase by about 45% to 67 million passengers per annum.&nbsp; This will however only be enough to cater to Changi's expected growth for perhaps the next 10 to 15 years.&nbsp; Our airport planners will be embarking on a detailed masterplanning for the next phase of Changi's expansion.&nbsp; Given our limited land and airspace, we will need to carefully study how Changi can be optimally expanded to ensure we are ready to seize future growth opportunities from the expected strong growth in global aviation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, Changi Airport's excellent service standard is one key aspect that sets it apart from its competitors.&nbsp; It is such an important element of Changi's success that the term \"The Changi Experience\" is recognised by airports and air travellers the world over as the epitome of&nbsp;airport excellence.&nbsp; Many airports have sought out Changi's consultancy and investment arm, Changi Airports International, or CAI,&nbsp; to be their partner&nbsp;as&nbsp;they believe Changi can bring value to&nbsp;airport planning and management.&nbsp; For instance, CAI was recently appointed to operate Abu Dhabi International Airport and has also entered into JVs to manage&nbsp;terminals at Nanjing Airport and Russia's&nbsp;Sheremetyevo Airport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travellers the world over shower&nbsp;Changi Airport with some 250 compliments every month.&nbsp; Many praise our airport staff for going beyond the call of duty, leaving an indelible impression which no amount of advertisement can<p align=left>Column: 3606<p> ever achieve.&nbsp;Let me give you two examples.&nbsp; Dr Vivien Chong from Singapore, for example, commended our Immigration officers for going the extra mile to renew his son's expired passport.&nbsp; She had gone to the airport, wanted to check in with her son's passport for a trip to Langkawi and then discovered that it&nbsp;had expired.&nbsp; The airport staff, ICA and CAAS&nbsp;managed to process it on time for her to make the trip.&nbsp; So she wrote to them and&nbsp;said, \"Our family is truly touched by what they have done.&nbsp; We felt tremendous warmth in our heart.&nbsp; We will and still are very grateful for what they have done.&nbsp; Your team&nbsp;made my experience with Changi Airport very pleasant and enjoyable.&nbsp; They have reflected very well on Singapore, the ICA and the CAAS.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One comment received from another passenger, Mr Anthony Comerford from New Zealand sums up The Changi Experience&nbsp;the&nbsp;best, and&nbsp;I quote him, \"This is the way all airports should be&nbsp;and I hope that others will follow in Singapore's footsteps.&nbsp; Little details, such as&nbsp;the amazingly clean shower&nbsp;amenities, free cinema and general fast-moving processing and positive attitude of the staff here, actually make it a pleasure to be in the airport, which is&nbsp;surely a&nbsp;first.\"&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"software\" aspects of Changi Airport must not only be preserved, but strengthened.&nbsp; Travellers must continue to enjoy a seamless flow to Changi and&nbsp;have fun shopping, eating and participating in events while doing so.&nbsp; We will also continue&nbsp;to provide training for frontline staff to ensure that the highest service standards are maintained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will continue to strengthen Changi's connectivity by anchoring existing airlines and attracting new ones.&nbsp; Without the network of air links, we cannot be an air hub.&nbsp; Over the years, we have provided&nbsp;our passenger and cargo airline partners with a wide range of<p align=left>Column: 3607<p> incentives to facilitate their operations here.&nbsp; The enhanced airline incentives under the three-year, $300 million Air Hub Development Fund 2 which began last year, had contributed to Changi's spectacular growth in 2006.&nbsp; These include rebates on landing fees and rewards for bringing in more traffic to Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as we develop new initiatives to attract more airlines and passengers to use Changi, we should not lose sight, as Mr Cedric Foo and Mr Wee Siew Kim said,&nbsp;of our air cargo sector.&nbsp; Our air cargo sector has done reasonably well.&nbsp; Changi's 4.2% growth in air cargo volume in 2006 is about in line with the worldwide growth of about 4.6%.&nbsp; By&nbsp;market share, in terms of international air cargo, Singapore is the sixth largest in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wee has asked if the objective of investing into&nbsp;the Airport Logistics Park of Singapore (ALPS) has been met.&nbsp; ALPS was established in 2003 in Changi's Free Trade Zone&nbsp;to promote value-added logistic activities and rapid turnaround services. It is well received by the industry.&nbsp; Since its opening, more than 80% of its land has been allocated to various leading freight forwarders and logistic companies, including DHL, UPS Supply Chain Solutions and Schenker.&nbsp; This good take-up rate reflects the appeal of ALPS and also Changi, for its excellent connectivity and efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further strengthen our position as an air cargo hub, CAAS has identified perishables handling as a potential growth segment to complement other segments.&nbsp; Perishables cargo comprises around 15% of air cargo worldwide and&nbsp;is expected to be a fast-growing segment.&nbsp; With specialised infrastructure and handling expertise, Changi Airport aims to capture a significant share of the flow of perishables cargo between Europe, Asia and Australia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3608<p>CAAS will also continue to ensure adequate air cargo capacity to complement the demand for air cargo in Singapore.&nbsp; For instance, a new Singapore cargo airline, Jett8 Cargo, is expected to commence operations later this year.&nbsp; CAAS will continue to work with its partners and stakeholders to attract new cargo airlines to operate into Singapore as well as encourage existing cargo airlines to grow&nbsp;at Changi Airport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to new growth areas outside of the conventional passenger market which would enhance Changi's connectivity and reach.&nbsp; We aim to improve Changi's value proposition to different passenger segments and, in&nbsp;this regard, I would like to assure Mr Wee Siew Kim of our desire to nurture the growth of low-cost carriers and corporate jets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low-cost carriers are becoming increasingly important in the regional aviation landscape and now accounts for about 15%&nbsp;of Changi's traffic.&nbsp; The Budget Terminal, which opened last March, is now handling about 130,000 passengers a month, utilising close to 60% of its 2.7 million passengers per annum capacity.&nbsp; With the strong traffic growth at the Budget Terminal, we expect to have to begin expanding the capacity of the Budget Terminal later this year, and plans are in place for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for corporate jets, they can either use Changi or Seletar airport, each with its own appeal.&nbsp; Many corporate jet users traditionally prefer Seletar Airport for its privacy and tranquility&nbsp;as it is not as busy as Changi. For jetsetters who prefer Changi and those with bigger jets that&nbsp;have to land&nbsp;at Changi, they can enjoy the exclusivity and premier services offered by the dedicated complex for Commercially Important Passengers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with Mr Wee Siew Kim that new technology can drive new growth opportunities.&nbsp; For instance, Very<p align=left>Column: 3609<p> Light Jets, or \"VLJs\", are becoming more prevalent&nbsp;and making possible the concept of \"air taxis\" for corporate clients.&nbsp; Let me assure Members that we will continue to monitor such trends in aircraft technology and travel preferences closely and assess the implications on Changi Airport.&nbsp; If there are potential opportunities that add to&nbsp;Singapore's&nbsp;vibrancy as an air hub, we would certainly study how our infrastructure and safety regulatory framework can accommodate such activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Changi would not have been&nbsp;the success&nbsp;that it is today had we not adopted&nbsp;a liberal aviation policy.&nbsp; This brings me to my fourth point.&nbsp; Singapore will continue to pursue more liberal bilateral and multilateral air services arrangements.&nbsp; For instance, we recently extended our&nbsp;Air Services Agreement (ASA) with India in January this year to allow Singapore carriers to double their services to New Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai over the next two to three years.&nbsp; This will support the strong traffic growth between Singapore and these three key metropolitan cities in India.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the multilateral front, Singapore is working closely with fellow ASEAN member countries to implement the ASEAN roadmap for an integrated air transport sector.&nbsp; It is an important initiative that will free up passenger and air freight services in ASEAN, with a vision that it would pave the way for an eventual ASEAN Open Skies in the long term.&nbsp; This would in turn facilitate the flow of people, trade and services, and enable ASEAN countries to leverage on each other's strengths to attract more tourists and investments.&nbsp; An ASEAN-wide air services arrangement will enable ASEAN, as a bloc, to then explore liberal air services arrangements with key dialogue partners like China and India, opening up even more opportunities for all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3610<p>With the ASEAN roadmap's milestone of December 2008 for unlimited access between ASEAN capital cities coming up, ASEAN members are now stepping up consultations to finalise the multilateral agreement to implement the roadmap.&nbsp; Last month, my fellow ASEAN Transport Ministers and I agreed to target for this agreement to be signed by the end of this year, so that it will be in time for the implementation of the first major milestone in December 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Mr Cedric Foo's question on opening up air links with Malaysia, let me reiterate that Singapore has always been prepared to review our ASA with Malaysia to expand air links.&nbsp; I recently met with the Malaysian Transport Minister Chan Kong Choy during the ASEAN Transport Ministers' Meeting in Bangkok to follow up on&nbsp;our earlier discussions on this matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that we have agreed to work towards greater liberalisation and that our officials are working out a date to meet in the near future to review the ASA.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a review is&nbsp;long overdue as the ASA was last reviewed more than 25 years ago in 1980.&nbsp;There is tremendous potential for more air links between both countries, given our close historical, economic and&nbsp;people-to-people ties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater liberalisation of the&nbsp;skies will unlock&nbsp;this potential, give travellers more destinations and carriers to choose from, and generate wider economic benefits for both countries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current situation, I agree with Mr Cedric Foo, is far from ideal.&nbsp; But until our ASA with Malaysia is liberalised, both sides would have to make the most of the existing air services arrangement.&nbsp; Allow me to elaborate on this in the&nbsp;context of the Singapore-KL trunk route, which has been in the media spotlight over the past year, and I think&nbsp;Mr Cedric Foo mentioned just now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3611<p>Currently, SIA and&nbsp;Malaysia Airlines provide the majority of the scheduled services between Singapore&nbsp;and KL.&nbsp; They jointly operate services on this route under&nbsp;a commercial arrangement which the two airlines negotiated after the leaders of both countries agreed in 1982 to allow the airlines to start&nbsp;a shuttle service between Singapore and KL,&nbsp;with the aim&nbsp;of providing frequent and regular services through coordinated flight schedules.&nbsp; Under this arrangement, SIA and&nbsp;Malaysia Airlines currently operate a total of 13 frequencies&nbsp;per day, which is more than what is allowed under our ASA with Malaysia.&nbsp; The ideal scenario would be&nbsp;to give unlimited access to all airlines on the route.&nbsp; Singapore is prepared to allow other Singapore and Malaysian&nbsp;carriers to operate on&nbsp;the Singapore/KL route,&nbsp;but this can only be done through a change in the current ASA and requires&nbsp;the agreement of Malaysia.&nbsp; Until this sector is liberalised, the status quo of a shuttle service providing amble and frequent services&nbsp;for consumers is the next best alternative.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the strategies that I have outlined will help maintain Changi's position as a leading aviation hub.&nbsp; Changi's success&nbsp;has significant economic spinoffs&nbsp;that extend beyond the airport.&nbsp; Not only has Changi's connectivity and extensive network of airlines contributed to Singapore's attractiveness as a business and tourism&nbsp;destination,&nbsp;it has also served as a foundation for our vibrant aerospace industry and other aviation-related businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for incentives to spur the growth of aviation-related industry,&nbsp;my Ministry continues to work closely with MTI and EDB to sharpen Singapore's competitiveness in attracting aerospace and aviation-related activities.&nbsp; This brings me to Mr Wee Siew Kim's query on whether there are plans to introduce incentives for the aviation sector, similar to what we have done in the maritime sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3612<p>In principle, I agree with him&nbsp;that if there are useful incentives that can bring in more aviation-related services, we should certainly consider them.&nbsp; However, let me point out&nbsp;a key difference between&nbsp;the aviation and the maritime industries.&nbsp;Unlike the maritime industry, the aviation industry remains heavily regulated by a series of bilateral ASAs between countries, and this makes airlines less mobile.&nbsp; Consequently, major airlines are almost always national enterprises&nbsp;that operate out of their home bases and are unable to relocate their base of operation overseas even if the fiscal environment overseas is more favourable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, our focus is to facilitate the operations of Singapore-based carriers as well as foreign carriers&nbsp;at Changi by</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The increasingly competitive and dynamic operating environment presents new challenges and many exciting opportunities.&nbsp; We have been successful in making Changi a leading aviation hub and establishing a vibrant aviation cluster in Singapore.&nbsp; We will build on this foundation and spare no effort to sharpen Changi's competitiveness and build an even more vibrant aviation sector.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So these were some of the considerations that were taken into account when we were planning the interchange.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Cedric Foo Chee Keng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Basically, if you look at our public transport users, they come in the first 60th percentile.&nbsp; So they take the median of that, ie, between the 20th to 40th percentile, and they monitor that and look at the trends to see how much they are spending on public transport as a percentage of their household income.&nbsp; And this has&nbsp;basically helped them to effect a slight improvement in the last few years.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for reversible lanes, this is something that LTA will look into.&nbsp; In order<p align=left>Column: 3615<p> to have reversible lanes, you must have a difference between the peak and off-peak periods in both directions.&nbsp; Otherwise,&nbsp;you cannot really reverse it, because then there is no improvement.&nbsp;

This injection of new Members into the House also <p align=left>Column: 3629<p>brings a new phase in our Parliamentary debates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifty-eight MPs filed 372 amendments in this Committee of Supply.&nbsp; Practically all the MPs used up the time allocated to them - 18 minutes for MPs and 20 minutes for GPC Chairmen.&nbsp; We changed the system in&nbsp;2005.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This new system has kept the number of amendments manageable, and averaging 366 cuts over the last&nbsp;three years. This is certainly&nbsp;much better than the inflationary number of cuts starting in 2001.&nbsp; We had&nbsp;484 amendments&nbsp;in 2001, 518 in 2002, 707 in 2003 and 769 in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new system&nbsp;has also enabled&nbsp;Members to focus on the key points in their speeches, some even with just a 30-second sound bite. Well done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know our MPs spent long hours researching the issues and preparing their speeches, particularly for those who have to speak in two languages.&nbsp; It was a great sweat.&nbsp; Some, of course, spoke more than two languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many spoke passionately about the issues of concern to them and their constituents.&nbsp; Their speeches were certainly&nbsp;impactful.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, some&nbsp;Members held no punches, while others even put&nbsp;the points across in a very colourful way, and yet not missing the seriousness of the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality of debate is very high.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;Members have certainly \"honed\" their skills as you had wished after we changed the system.&nbsp; They indeed spent the time&nbsp;allocated to them very wisely.&nbsp; They have distilled the key messages in their speeches to keep within the time they asked for and were allocated.&nbsp; Very few had to suffer a cut by the guillotine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3630<p> I will not be wrong if I say that my Cabinet colleagues and I will agree with me that the speeches certainly had our attention.&nbsp; I also believe that even if the Ministers did not fully deal with&nbsp;all the points or the suggestions&nbsp;Members have made, they would study the&nbsp;suggestions carefully and see what can be done and&nbsp;adopted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, when I was appointed Leader of the House on 25th February 1987, there were only&nbsp;three women MPs.&nbsp; Today, we have 23 women MPs - 17 elected, 1 NCMP and 5 NMPs.&nbsp; This is a refreshing change from the 1980s&nbsp;and a significant improvement.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1987, 45 MPs filed 367 cuts and it took almost as many days as this one.&nbsp; The Ministries which had the most cuts between the late 1980s and up to the recent years were National Development and Education - about&nbsp;five to&nbsp;six hours each.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the focus seems to have changed to the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, with 36 individual cuts, and 29 MPs moving just one cut on each&nbsp;item.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The COS debate on MCYS lasted 5 hours and 35 minutes, compared to just 2 hours and 25 minutes when I was the Minister in the same Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the issues under MCYS are closest to the hearts and minds&nbsp;of our MPs and to their constituents.&nbsp;&nbsp;But Members should&nbsp;not forget that we have&nbsp;other equally important issues to also&nbsp;debate, but&nbsp;these took up much less time&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;MCYS'.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foreign policy took up just 50 minutes, while issues concerning health, economy, education, security and national development took between&nbsp;three and&nbsp;four-and-a-half hours each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps MPs should re-examine this and see how to spread out their limited time to also focus&nbsp;on other issues of <p align=left>Column: 3631<p>concern to Singaporeans, and&nbsp;Singapore's future&nbsp;and survival.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have changed the Standing Orders to allow MPs to speak in two languages and that indeed has livened the debate and also enabled our MPs to reach out to their constituents who may not understand English.&nbsp; So I shall also try this by speaking in Mandarin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070309/20070309VS_163922.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the Budget debate, many Members have used two languages to express the people&rsquo;s aspirations.&nbsp; Some of them required a lot of time to prepare these multi-lingual speeches.&nbsp; At the same time, they have also taken the opportunity to speak in their mother tongue.&nbsp; This has raised the understanding and knowledge of the mother tongue and Members too have a deeper understanding of the language.&nbsp; This is really putting into practice what they have learned.&nbsp; Their multi-lingual speeches were very interesting and lively and they deserve our compliments.&nbsp; The debating standard is high and, at the same time, to those constituents who do not know English, they will have a better appreciation and understanding of the issues raised in Parliament.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Having been Leader for 20 years, I think it is time to change.&nbsp; There must be renewal too but it has taken a long time to come.&nbsp; So I discussed it with the Prime Minister just a few days ago.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;the Prime Minister has decided that Mr Mah Bow Tan, who has been Deputy Leader since 2002, will be appointed as Leader, and Dr Ng Eng Hen will be the Deputy Leader.&nbsp; Similarly, Sir, I know my colleague, Dr Lee Boon Yang also thinks that he has been in the same job for a long time.&nbsp;

All these changes will take effect from 1st April 2007.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, Sir, may I thank you and your Deputies for your patience for&nbsp;sitting through long hours of speeches.&nbsp;Thank you.</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Hon. Members, we have now come to the end of yet another Budget debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;This time around, as mentioned earlier by Mr Wong, we have 24 new MPs, 1 NCMP&nbsp;and 9 new NMPs taking part in the debate for the first time.&nbsp;I think they have performed well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am encouraged indeed and refreshed by their enthusiasm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most have taken their first time exposure to the debate in their stride and have adapted to the new COS debate format rather quickly too.&nbsp; This bodes well for the future of&nbsp;debates in this House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have had a good and sometimes robust debate in this House.&nbsp; Many new backbenchers spoke with passion and conviction, with some lightening their speeches with earthy humour.&nbsp;&nbsp;One speech, in particular, has even earned such adjectives as \"colourful\" and \"pungent\".&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this&nbsp;prompted one senior backbencher to remark to me that perhaps I was getting soft in allowing such exchanges in this House! That may be so, as I also note that I had imposed fewer guillotines this year and that, too,&nbsp;on the usual suspects!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon Members, on behalf of this House, I would like to thank DPM Wong<p align=left>Column: 3633<p> Kan Seng and Dr Lee Boon Yang - who are relinquishing their positions as Leader of the House and Government Whip respectively - for their sterling services to this House. They have assisted me immensely in ensuring that our sittings proceed smoothly and are in keeping with the dignity of Parliament.&nbsp; I would like to welcome Mr Mah Bow Tan, the incoming Leader of the House, and Mr Lim Swee Say, our new Whip and their respective deputies, Dr Ng Eng Hen and Dr Amy Khor.&nbsp;I am sure that the House would join me in congratulating them on their new responsibilities and I look forward to working with them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 3634<p> Before I conclude, I would also like to thank my Deputy Speakers for standing in for me as the afternoons wore on, and my Parliament staff for their hard work.&nbsp;I would like to end by thanking all hon. Members for their coorperation, understanding and their participation in the debate. [<I>Applause</I>.]</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->     \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 3634<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT:::3656--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ADJOURNMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</p><p align=\"right\">Six o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P></P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P>\t        <!--MP_NAME:--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B> </B></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag --><!--SECTION_NAME:APPENDICES--><P><div align=center><B>APPENDICES</B></div><P>\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\t<div align=center>\t\t  \t\t\t        \t", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
