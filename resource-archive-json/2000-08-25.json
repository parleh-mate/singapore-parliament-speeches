for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment, in view of the \"killer-litter\" problem and while\r\n\r\neducation  and  penalties are accepted forms  of  deterrence,\r\n\r\nwhether  he  will  also  consider  other  solutions  such  as\r\n\r\nbuilding canopies around the building at the first storey  so\r\n\r\nthat  any falling object will not fall directly on any person\r\n\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member's suggestion of building canopies\r\n\r\nalong  the  perimeter at the first storey of every HDB  block\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  a very practical one, because they may  instead\r\n\r\npose other problems, such as security risk to apartment units\r\n\r\non the second floor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to inform the Member that HDB will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  look  into ways to improve the  design  of  our\r\n\r\npublic  housing  estates  with  a  view  to  minimising  this\r\n\r\nproblem.   Recent  improvements include provision  of  proper\r\n\r\ncovered  entrance  porches  at each  HDB  block  and  covered\r\n\r\nlinkways  within  the  estates, which offer  some  degree  of\r\n\r\nprotection to HDB residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, I would like to stress that design\r\n\r\nsolutions alone cannot prevent killer litter.  The root cause\r\n\r\nof  the  problem is the lack of civic consciousness  among  a\r\n\r\nsmall  minority  of HDB residents.  For these  residents  who\r\n\r\ncontinue to ignore the public education messages and  display\r\n\r\nblatant  disregard for the safety of their fellow  residents,\r\n\r\nHDB  will take strong enforcement action as provided  for  in\r\n\r\nour  legislation.  This includes compulsory acquisition of  a\r\n\r\nsold  HDB  flat  when  the lessee, his spouse  or  authorised\r\n\r\noccupier is convicted of a killer litter offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the recent spate of killer litter\r\n\r\nincidents  and the public discussion and feedback  generated,\r\n\r\nmy  Ministry,  together  with the Ministry  of  Law  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs, has decided to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreview  the current legislation on killer litter offences  to\r\n\r\nreinforce  the legal infrastructure to complement our  public\r\n\r\neducation  efforts.  Meanwhile, we will continue  to  educate\r\n\r\nthe  public on the dangers of killer litter.  The  HDB,  Town\r\n\r\nCouncils  and the grassroots organisations will impress  upon\r\n\r\nHDB  residents that they have a civic responsibility to their\r\n\r\nfellow  HDB residents.  Ultimately, everyone has  a  part  to\r\n\r\nplay in making our HDB estates a safer place to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there have\r\n\r\nbeen  a  lot  of  discussions in the papers about  compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition of flats.  Does the Minister not think  that  the\r\n\r\ncompulsory  acquisition of a HDB flat is a  bit  too  severe,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  punishes the family members  who  are  innocent,\r\n\r\nrather  than the offender himself?  He has also said that  he\r\n\r\nwould  review  the range of penalties.  Has the  review  been\r\n\r\ncompleted?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, first of all, on whether the\r\n\r\npenalties are too harsh, I think it is probably useful for us\r\n\r\nto  remember  that  the victims of such  offences  are   also\r\n\r\nsuffering  very  severely.  Killer litter  offences,  whether\r\n\r\ncommitted  by  the lessees or committed by members  of  their\r\n\r\nhouseholds,  can injure, maim and even kill.  As  to  whether\r\n\r\nthe  punishment  is too harsh, in certain  cases  where  such\r\n\r\noffences are committed deliberately, blatantly or where it is\r\n\r\na case of a recalcitrant offence, I do not think anyone would\r\n\r\ndisagree if we were to compulsorily acquire the flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do grant that there may be other instances\r\n\r\nwhere  such  a  penalty may be too severe, and  this  is  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  I explained earlier that the various  Ministries\r\n\r\ninvolved will do a review of the offences.  The objective  of\r\n\r\nthis  review  is to make sure that the penalties  for  killer\r\n\r\nlitter  are strong but fair.  We need to make sure  that  the\r\n\r\npenalties do act as a severe deterrence against future killer\r\n\r\nlitter  offences, because I think we do owe a  responsibility\r\n\r\nto  the  other residents in HDB estates.  After all,  86%  or\r\n\r\nalmost nine out of 10 Singaporeans live in HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the penalties must be seen to be\r\n\r\nfair.  To achieve this, we will look at the penalties to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  they  are commensurate with the  nature  of  such\r\n\r\noffences and yet be flexible enough for the punishments to be\r\n\r\ncalibrated according to the severity of the offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, a person who commits killer litter offences\r\n\r\ncan  be prosecuted by the police under the Penal Code.  Under\r\n\r\nthe Penal Code provisions against rash or negligent acts, the\r\n\r\nmaximum sentence ranges from an imprisonment term of 3 months\r\n\r\nto  2  years  and/or  maximum  fines  from  $250  to  $1,000,\r\n\r\ndepending on the gravity of the offence.  There is no cap  on\r\n\r\nfines for rash acts resulting in death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs will be introducing a\r\n\r\nspecific  provision in the Penal Code that targets at  killer\r\n\r\nlitter   offences.   This  is  different  from  the   general\r\n\r\nprovisions against rash and negligent acts under which killer\r\n\r\nlitter   offenders  are  currently  prosecuted.   Under   the\r\n\r\nspecific  provision for killer litter offences,  the  maximum\r\n\r\npenalties  will  be  enhanced  to  give  the  courts  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility to mete out stiffer punishments on the offenders,\r\n\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of a specific and enhanced punishment\r\n\r\nin  the  Penal  Code recognises the community's strong  stand\r\n\r\nagainst  killer  litter.   These new  provisions  for  killer\r\n\r\nlitter  offences  will form part of a  review  which  MHA  is\r\n\r\ncurrently doing of the Penal Code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the court's punishment on killer litter\r\n\r\noffenders,  the HDB, as the public housing authority,  has  a\r\n\r\nresponsibility to help maintain public safety in HDB estates.\r\n\r\nCurrently, under the Housing and Development Act, the HDB  is\r\n\r\nempowered  to compulsorily acquire a HDB flat if, as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  the convicted killer litter offender is either  the\r\n\r\nlessee, the spouse or an authorised occupier above the age of\r\n\r\n14.   Depending on the gravity of the offence,  the  HDB  can\r\n\r\nissue   a   final  written  warning  in  lieu  of  compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from Members of this House and from members of\r\n\r\nthe public suggest\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  such  a  measure may be too harsh on the  rest  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  especially if the offender is not a flat lessee  but\r\n\r\nan  authorised  occupier.  HDB, as the  landlord  and  public\r\n\r\nhousing authority, has the responsibility to promptly move  a\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  killer litter offender out of a  high-rise  HDB\r\n\r\nflat,  as he poses a threat to public safety.  It is on  this\r\n\r\nbasis   that  the  HDB's  compulsory  acquisition  power   is\r\n\r\njustified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HDB will continue to compulsorily acquire HDB flats\r\n\r\nof  very serious or recalcitrant killer litter offenders.  In\r\n\r\nother  words, compulsory acquisition as provided for  in  the\r\n\r\nAct  will remain.  Such an offender will be debarred for five\r\n\r\nyears from buying or renting another HDB flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For cases which are serious but not severe enough to\r\n\r\nwarrant  compulsory  acquisition, the HDB  will  require  the\r\n\r\noffender  and his household to sell their flat and  move  out\r\n\r\nwithin six months.  In order not to deprive the family  of  a\r\n\r\nroof over their heads, the offender will be allowed to buy or\r\n\r\nrent a ground or first floor HDB flat.  However, he will  not\r\n\r\nbe  permitted to buy or rent a HDB flat above the first floor\r\n\r\nfor at least three years from the date of eviction.  This  is\r\n\r\nfor cases which do not warrant compulsory acquisition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For less serious cases, HDB will issue a final written\r\n\r\nwarning  to  the offender.  And if the offence  is  repeated,\r\n\r\nthen HDB will take compulsory acquisition action.  These  are\r\n\r\nthe  various levels of actions that HDB will take,  depending\r\n\r\non  the  severity  of  the offence.  The objective  of  these\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  of severity is, in the ultimate,  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that the offender does not remain in the flat and  does\r\n\r\nnot have an opportunity to commit the offence again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the Minister\r\n\r\nthink  that it is equitable to all Singaporeans, in terms  of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  acquisition  of  HDB  flat  for  killer   littler\r\n\r\noffence?   If  a  killer litter offender lives in  a  private\r\n\r\ncondominium,  is  there any law that his private  condominium\r\n\r\nunit can be acquired as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there could be a situation where the killer\r\n\r\nlitter  offender is a mental patient.  In such a case,  would\r\n\r\nthe HDB consider moving the offender down to ground floor  to\r\n\r\nsolve the problem?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, the Member asked, firstly, whether\r\n\r\nit  is  equitable for killer litter offenders to  lose  their\r\n\r\nflats.  Again, I must qualify that it depends on the severity\r\n\r\nof the offence.  If the person is a very serious offender,  a\r\n\r\nrecalcitrant  or  repeat  offender, then  under  the  revised\r\n\r\nguidelines,  he will lose his flat.  Under such circumstance,\r\n\r\nI  do  not think any member of the public will feel that this\r\n\r\nis unjustified.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question whether a person in a private housing\r\n\r\nestate will also be similarly evicted, the answer is no,  for\r\n\r\nthe  simple  reason that the HDB does not have  powers.   The\r\n\r\nHousing and Development Act does not confer any powers on the\r\n\r\nHDB  to move into a private property.  Private properties are\r\n\r\nmanaged  by their own management corporations under the  Land\r\n\r\nTitles (Strata) Act.  However, if there is an offender  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate  estate and if that person is convicted, he  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the specific provisions which the Ministry of Home\r\n\r\nAffairs  will be promulgating.  In other words, if you  throw\r\n\r\nsomething  down in a private condominium and you  are  caught\r\n\r\nand  convicted,  you  will face the  same  severe  penalties.\r\n\r\nWhether  you are in a private or public estate, you  will  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the same laws.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as to whether his flat will be taken back, I\r\n\r\nthink that is a separate matter.  As I explained earlier, HDB\r\n\r\nis  doing  this  because  it  has  a  responsibility  to  its\r\n\r\nresidents.    It   does   not  stop  or  prevent   management\r\n\r\ncorporations from taking similar action against offenders  in\r\n\r\ntheir  estates.  It is entirely up to them.  So there  is  no\r\n\r\nquestion of whether it is fair or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point he raised about mental patients,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, it is up to the police whether such a  person\r\n\r\nwill be prosecuted.  The police has the discretion whether to\r\n\r\nbring  such  a  person  to court or  not,  depending  on  the\r\n\r\ninvestigations.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult  for us to say that when a person claims  insanity,\r\n\r\ntherefore  he  cannot be prosecuted.  If we  were  to  accept\r\n\r\nthat, then everybody will claim insanity.  So it is really up\r\n\r\nto  the  police who does the investigations and  who  decides\r\n\r\nwhether  such  a  plea is justified or not, or  whether  that\r\n\r\nperson should be brought to court.  Having made the decision,\r\n\r\nthen  it is left to the courts to decide whether that accused\r\n\r\nperson  is guilty or not and, if so, to mete out the relevant\r\n\r\npunishment.  It is only when the person is convicted that HDB\r\n\r\nhas the power to then decide what to do.  Here, HDB now has a\r\n\r\nrange  of  options  to  decide whether to  acquire  the  flat\r\n\r\nimmediately, to evict the person and allow him six months  to\r\n\r\nleave,  to  sell the flat and to buy a flat on a lower  floor\r\n\r\nor, if need be, to just issue a final warning.  These are the\r\n\r\nvarious options the HDB will have.  Compulsory acquisition is\r\n\r\nnot the only option that will be available to HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta-Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  welcome  this more calibrated approach  to  killer-litter offences  by MND as well as MHA.  I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  whether, in the light of  this  approach,  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Act could be reviewed to  raise  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  penalty from $1,000 to $5,000, same as  the  penalty\r\n\r\nimposed by the Town Council, for the non-penal offences.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I would like to acknowledge that the\r\n\r\nMember  has actually pointed this out to the Ministry  and  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  inform him that immediate action would be taken  to\r\n\r\nregularise  and harmonise these two provisions to  make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no confusion.  In other words, when  such  an\r\n\r\noffence  is committed, both the Town Council and the HDB  can\r\n\r\nact either separately or together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. B.

Does  the Minister realise that  this  is  double\r\n\r\njeopardy, which is wholly wrong in principle?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question that I have is the one raised by the\r\n\r\nMember for Hougang,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich I was going to ask.  Is the Minister not discriminating\r\n\r\nbetween  a  dweller  in public housing and  a  dweller  in  a\r\n\r\nprivate flat?  Why the discrimination?  If it is bad  in  one\r\n\r\ncase it is bad in the other.  The Government can acquire that\r\n\r\nflat  and sell it.  Why is he showing discrimination?  May  I\r\n\r\nhave short answers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The short answer to the second question\r\n\r\nis  that the Government is not discriminating.  When a person\r\n\r\nis  convicted  of  a  killer litter offence,  whether  he  is\r\n\r\nstaying  in a private condominium or he is staying in  a  HDB\r\n\r\nestate,  he goes to jail or he is fined, whichever  the  case\r\n\r\nis,  and  the level of penalties meted out will be  the  same\r\n\r\nirrespective   of   where  he  stays.   So   where   is   the\r\n\r\ndiscrimination?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as the action taken by HDB is concerned, this\r\n\r\nis entirely a matter between the landlord, which in this case\r\n\r\nis  the HDB, and the lessee.  It is surely the responsibility\r\n\r\nof  the HDB as the landlord, in the same way that it will  be\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility of a management corporation of a  private\r\n\r\nestate, to make sure that the safety of the residents in  its\r\n\r\nestate  is  safeguarded.    I do not see what is  wrong  with\r\n\r\nthat.   It is entirely within the rights of HDB to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat the residents who live in HDB estates can walk around in\r\n\r\ncomfort and safety.  So by moving the person from a high-rise\r\n\r\nflat  to  a low-rise flat to make sure that that person  does\r\n\r\nnot  repeat the offence is an eminently reasonable  thing  to\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nquestion.

Singapore imports all the fuel oil required  for\r\n\r\npower  generation.    Our electricity  tariffs  are  reviewed\r\n\r\nquarterly  and adjusted, if necessary, to pass on changes  in\r\n\r\nfuel oil prices to consumers.  The computations are based  on\r\n\r\nforecast  of  near term oil prices.  Any discrepancy  between\r\n\r\nthe forecast and actual oil prices will result in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neither  an  over-  or under-collection of  revenue  by  Power\r\n\r\nSupply.   Under  the current price regulation  regime,  Power\r\n\r\nSupply is allowed to recover the under-collected revenue  or,\r\n\r\nalternatively, required to return over-collected  revenue  to\r\n\r\nconsumers in the following quarter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 1998, Power Supply reduced the electricity\r\n\r\ntariffs by 14% to an average of 11.74 cents per kwh when fuel\r\n\r\noil  prices fell. Since then, fuel oil prices have  increased\r\n\r\nby  109%,  from  US$11 per barrel in May 1998  to  US$23  per\r\n\r\nbarrel  in  July  2000.   It has gone up even  further  since\r\n\r\nthen.   Nevertheless,  Power Supply kept electricity  tariffs\r\n\r\nunchanged  until  December 1999. I have distributed  a  graph\r\n\r\n(Cols.  771-772). which is available on Members' seats  which\r\n\r\nshows how much fuel oil prices have gone up  since March 1999\r\n\r\nand how our electricity tariffs have also changed during that\r\n\r\nperiod.    But because tariffs were kept unchanged  for  many\r\n\r\nmonths, this has resulted in a substantial under-recovery  of\r\n\r\ncost  by  Power  Supply  and  therefore  the  need  for   the\r\n\r\nelectricity  tariffs to be adjusted three  times  this  year.\r\n\r\nAltogether  tariffs  have increased by  44%  since  May  1998\r\n\r\ncompared  to  fuel oil cost increase of 109%  over  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720771.gif\">Graph - Average Electricity Tariff and Fuel Oil Price (Cols. 771 - 772)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mitigate the impact of the increase, Power Supply has\r\n\r\nspread  the last tariff increase in August 2000 over a period\r\n\r\nlonger  than  the usual 3-month period.  For residential  and\r\n\r\nsmall  non-domestic customers, the adjustment is spread  over\r\n\r\neight months.  For large non-domestic customers, it is spread\r\n\r\nover five months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Singapore Power has granted rebates to\r\n\r\nconsumers  to help them tide over the economic crisis.  Since\r\n\r\nJuly  1998,  Singapore  Power has  implemented  a  series  of\r\n\r\nrebates,  increasing in steps from 0.3 cent per kwh  in  July\r\n\r\n1998  to 1.3 cent per kwh in January 2000. Up till end  March\r\n\r\n2000,  Singapore Power has given back a total of $355 million\r\n\r\nto the consumers in rebates.  The rebates will continue until\r\n\r\nthe end of this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his question, Mr Tay pointed out that Singapore Power\r\n\r\nmade a record profit of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$904 million in 1999.  This translated into a Return on Total\r\n\r\nAssets  (ROTA) of 8.3%.  However, this was not the result  of\r\n\r\nany   tariff  increases.  Singapore  Power  actually  reduced\r\n\r\ntariffs  in  May 1998, and kept them unchanged till  December\r\n\r\n1999.  The  profits  were  the  result  of  productivity  and\r\n\r\nefficiency  gains  by  Singapore  Power.   Singapore  Power's\r\n\r\ntariffs  are  regulated through a price cap using  the  CPI-X\r\n\r\napproach,  ie,  Singapore Power is allowed to adjust  tariffs\r\n\r\n(excluding  fuel  costs) by less than  the  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price Index, because we expect Singapore  Power  to\r\n\r\nshow  productivity gains and reduce its costs  from  year  to\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPI-X formula depends on X, the amount by which we\r\n\r\nexpect SP to improve productivity. If productivity goes up by\r\n\r\nmore  than X, SP gets to keep the gains. X was set  in  April\r\n\r\n1997 for a 3-year period, at 1% per annum.  PUB reviewed this\r\n\r\nformula  in  March,  at  the end of the  3-year  period,  and\r\n\r\ndecided  to  maintain X at 1% for one more  year  until  next\r\n\r\nApril,  since Singapore Power's expected ROTA was within  the\r\n\r\ntargeted 7-8% range.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in the process of restructuring the\r\n\r\nelectricity  industry into a competitive market.   I  briefed\r\n\r\nMembers on this during this year's Committee of Supply.  Next\r\n\r\nApril,  the  generation  companies  will  be  taken  out   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power. Once the industry is fully  liberalised  in\r\n\r\nabout  3  years' time, consumers will enjoy more  competitive\r\n\r\nelectricity rates, better services and choice of suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is the Minister aware that the\r\n\r\nrecent  increases  in electricity tariff have  exerted  great\r\n\r\ncost  pressure  on families?  Secondly, the Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nanswer said that in 3 years' time consumers would enjoy  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive electricity tariffs.  Is he sure of  that?   Does\r\n\r\nhe mean that it would be much lower?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> We are very aware that the\r\n\r\nincrease in utility prices has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  a  point of much concern to many households.  For  that\r\n\r\nreason,  I thank Mr Tay Beng Chuan for raising this issue  in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have attached, with the chart, a page (Cols. 773-774)\r\n\r\nentitled  \"Rebates  for Utilities Bills\"  to  show  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has done to offset the increase in utility prices.\r\n\r\nIn  January 1997 when the Government restructured  the  water\r\n\r\ntariff,  water  conservation tax  and  water-borne  fees,  we\r\n\r\nintroduced  a  system of rebates to be phased  in  over  four\r\n\r\nyears.   It is shown in Table 1.  We have loaded it in favour\r\n\r\nof  those  who  are living in 1- to 3-room  HDB  flats.   The\r\n\r\nrebates   are  given  annually  on  1st  September  to   help\r\n\r\nhouseholds  overcome the effects of utility  prices,  without\r\n\r\nsubsidising  utilities because we do not  want  to  subsidise\r\n\r\nutilities  directly as this will encourage over  consumption.\r\n\r\nWhat  we found is that over the last two years, 1- and 2-room\r\n\r\nflats   have  not  increased  their  electricity   or   water\r\n\r\nconsumption.  For 4-room flats and above, there has  been  an\r\n\r\nincrease.   The  rebates that we have given  will  completely\r\n\r\noffset  the  increase in electricity and water  tariffs  this\r\n\r\nyear  for  1-  to  3-room flats.  This is  according  to  the\r\n\r\nnumbers  which we have calculated.  Consumers can expect  the\r\n\r\nrebates  to be included when they receive their bill  at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  September.  For 1- to 3-room flats, the  rebates  of\r\n\r\n$200 will kick in.  For 4-room HDB flats, the rebate will  be\r\n\r\n$100.  This answers Mr Low's first question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720773.htm\">Page - Rebates for Utilities Bill (Cols. 773 - 774)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his second question whether we can expect more\r\n\r\ncompetitive   prices  when  we  deregulate  the   electricity\r\n\r\nindustry,  I think so.  In other words, if he takes  out  the\r\n\r\nfuel  oil  component,  which depends on international  energy\r\n\r\nmarket  prices,  he  will  find more  products  available  to\r\n\r\nconsumers.  In New Zealand, where the electricity market  has\r\n\r\nbeen deregulated, every household has a choice of maybe 4  to\r\n\r\n8   electricity  suppliers.   These  suppliers,   which   are\r\n\r\nelectricity  retailers,  will  have  their  own   long   term\r\n\r\ncontracts  with  the  power generating companies.   They  may\r\n\r\npackage them in different ways for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  consumers.  For instance, if you are  prepared  to\r\n\r\naccept interruptible electricity supply, you may get a  lower\r\n\r\nrate.   If  you  use electricity at night, whether  for  air-conditioning or to heat water or recharge electric cars, then\r\n\r\nyou  may  enjoy  low  rates.  There could  be  other  bundles\r\n\r\ncreated.   For  instance, instead of buying  air-conditioners\r\n\r\nand  electricity separately, you may well go into a  contract\r\n\r\nwith  a  service provider who undertakes to provide a certain\r\n\r\nlevel  of air-conditioning or dehumidification for a  certain\r\n\r\nfixed price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all kinds of new products would be possible once we\r\n\r\nderegulate.   It is a complicated exercise.  We are  starting\r\n\r\nwith  the  privatisation of the Gencos (generation companies)\r\n\r\nnext year, and then we will progressively open up more of the\r\n\r\nmarket for competition.  And we hope that, say, within  three\r\n\r\nyears, all households will have choices available to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Would the Minister\r\n\r\nexplain  how  Singapore Power determines the  basic  rate  of\r\n\r\nelectricity tariffs?  What is the profit margin for Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  to charge the consumers for electricity?  And  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  these  huge  record profits  for  year  1999,  can\r\n\r\nSingapore Power be asked to trim the tariffs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Although the profits appear\r\n\r\nvery  large, in fact it is over a very big asset base,  which\r\n\r\nwas  why the Return on Total Assets was only 8.3% even though\r\n\r\nthe  profits exceeded $900 million.  Our target for Singapore\r\n\r\nPower  is  7% to 8%, which is a reasonable return on  utility\r\n\r\ntype assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Singapore Power set tariffs? There are two\r\n\r\ncomponents.   There are fuel prices for which the  regulatory\r\n\r\nstructure requires a complete pass through.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nSingapore  Power  should make no money from  fluctuations  in\r\n\r\nfuel  oil  prices.   Then  for the  non-fuel  component,  for\r\n\r\ntransmission  cost,  for  grid charges,  it  is  a  regulated\r\n\r\nmonopoly.  So there has got\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be argy-bargy.  We say, all right, this is your base, and\r\n\r\nevery  year  you  are  expected to show  an  X%  increase  in\r\n\r\nproductivity  after netting off for inflation,  and  we  have\r\n\r\nworked  out 1%.  They have done better than that, principally\r\n\r\nbecause  between the management and the unions, they  managed\r\n\r\nto  galvanise the workers to really review all operations  in\r\n\r\nthe  industry and to see how they can make efficiency  gains.\r\n\r\nThey  have  done  a good job.  In the last  two  years,  they\r\n\r\nincreased  productivity substantially and  this  has  enabled\r\n\r\nthem to increase their profit margins.  Should we now, having\r\n\r\nencouraged  them to increase efficiency, tax their efficiency\r\n\r\nby  saying,  \"Look, since you have made the efficiency  gain,\r\n\r\nnow  we  claw it back and subsidise consumers.\"?   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that is a good principle because if you do that  once,\r\n\r\nthen  in future when you set targets for them, they will say,\r\n\r\n\"No, no.\"  Just do nothing.  Because if you do more, you will\r\n\r\nbe penalised for doing more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is important to maintain the integrity of the\r\n\r\nregulatory  structure and keep in place the incentives  which\r\n\r\nare important for the long term.  If rebates should be given,\r\n\r\nthey  should be given outside this system directly, which  is\r\n\r\nwhat we have done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the Minister whether he has\r\n\r\nnot  missed the point in the question that was posed to  him?\r\n\r\nThe question was: what is the justification for increase,  if\r\n\r\nyou  have  made  a profit of almost a billion  dollars?

With an increasing proportion of the workforce  being\r\n\r\nbetter  educated,  more employees are expected  to  join  the\r\n\r\nexecutive ranks.  This could result in an employer having  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  two  or more unions in the company if  executives\r\n\r\nopted  to  form their own unions.  The NTUC was of  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  a single union at a workplace is preferable to multiple\r\n\r\nunions.   A  single union could better promote  teamwork  and\r\n\r\ncloser labour management cooperation.  NTUC also pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  a  single union representing rank-and-file workers  and\r\n\r\nexecutives  would enable unions to draw good leaders  from  a\r\n\r\nlarger talent pool.  Good leadership in our union movement is\r\n\r\ncritical  to  ensure  that trade unions  are  able  to  serve\r\n\r\nworkers and help to enhance tripartite cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also noted employers' concern that\r\n\r\nunionization  of  executives  in rank-and-file  unions  could\r\n\r\naffect  management effectiveness and flexibility.   Employers\r\n\r\nhad  expressed  concerns  that there  could  be  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest, which may undermine business competitiveness.  Some\r\n\r\nMNCs  were worried about the unionization of their executives\r\n\r\nin  the  light of the adversarial labour-management relations\r\n\r\nin their home countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee noted the concerns of both employers and\r\n\r\nunions.  It concluded that in view of our harmonious labour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmanagement  relations, it would be desirable  to  allow  some\r\n\r\nexecutives  to  join  rank-and-file  unions.   The  Committee\r\n\r\nproposed  that  executives who do not have senior  management\r\n\r\nresponsibility and substantial managerial functions  such  as\r\n\r\nhiring,  promotion, dismissal and disciplinary functions,  be\r\n\r\nallowed   to  join  rank-and-file  unions.   They  could   be\r\n\r\nrepresented  by  the rank-and-file unions  on  an  individual\r\n\r\nbasis  in respect of retrenchment and dismissal but  not  for\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining purposes.  The Committee held the  view\r\n\r\nthat  this approach would enable the unions to maintain their\r\n\r\nmembership  base yet avoid conflicts of interest or  loss  of\r\n\r\nmanagement effectiveness and flexibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that its recommendations do not adversely\r\n\r\naffect  labour management relations and Singapore's  economic\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  the  Committee  further  proposed  that   a\r\n\r\nTripartite   Working   Group  be  set   up   to   study   the\r\n\r\nimplementation issues and to reach out to employer groups  to\r\n\r\nexplain  the recommendations.  In the meantime, the  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  consider  appropriate  legislative  changes  to   the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations  Act to enable some  executives  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented by rank-and-file unions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform the House that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has  accepted  the  recommendations  of  the\r\n\r\nTripartite  Committee,  including  setting  up  a  Tripartite\r\n\r\nWorking  Group  and  studying amendments  to  the  Industrial\r\n\r\nRelations  Act.   I  would like to take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nthank   members  of  the  Tripartite  Committee   for   their\r\n\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SENIOR CIVIL SERVANTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Policy on sitting on boards of private companies and Government-linked companies)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lew Syn Pau</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what\r\n\r\nis  the  Government's policy on senior civil servants sitting\r\n\r\non\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Boards of Directors of private companies and Government-linked   companies;  and  whether  there  are  conflicts   of\r\n\r\ninterests and, if so, how are these conflicts resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the Civil Service has for many years operated a\r\n\r\nscheme  to  appoint senior civil servants to  the  Boards  of\r\n\r\nDirectors   of  Government-linked  companies  (GLCs).    Such\r\n\r\nappointments  help  the  officers to  better  understand  the\r\n\r\nnature  of business and industry, and at the same time enable\r\n\r\nthe company to benefit from the officers' contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each such appointment is individually vetted and\r\n\r\napproved  by  the parent ministry of the officer  and/or  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Service  Division,  to ensure  that  no  conflict  of\r\n\r\ninterest  will arise.  The officers appointed do not  receive\r\n\r\ndirectorship fees directly from the companies.  Instead,  the\r\n\r\nGLCs  pay  the  fees  to  the  Directorship  and  Consultancy\r\n\r\nAppointment  Council (DCAC), which in turn pays the  officers\r\n\r\nan   annual   allowance,  depending   on   their   level   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility on the boards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, the civil service has rarely approved\r\n\r\nappointments of officers from the Ministries to the boards of\r\n\r\nnon-GLCs.  However, there have been exceptions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Mr Teo Ming Kian, Chairman of the National\r\n\r\nScience  and  Technology Board (NSTB), sits on the  board  of\r\n\r\nAsiaOne.   PSD approved this after the Ministry of Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  which supervises NSTB assessed that  there  was  no\r\n\r\nconflict of interest with Mr Teo's primary job as Chairman of\r\n\r\nNSTB,  and  that it would not affect Mr Teo's performance  of\r\n\r\nofficial duties as a public officer.  In addition, Mr Teo was\r\n\r\nnot allowed to accept any shares or options which AsiaOne may\r\n\r\noffer  to  its  Board  of Directors.   Mr  Teo  accepted  the\r\n\r\ninvitation  to sit on the AsiaOne board primarily  to  better\r\n\r\nunderstand these newly emerging Internet companies so that he\r\n\r\ncould  help develop a more supportive environment  for  them.\r\n\r\nBesides Mr Teo, a few NSTB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nofficers sit on the boards of private companies in which NSTB\r\n\r\nis  a  significant  shareholder, as part  of  fulfilling  its\r\n\r\nscience and technology development charter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several officers of the Economic Development Board (EDB)\r\n\r\nand EDBI (or EDB Investments), which is EDB's investment arm,\r\n\r\nhave  also been appointed to the boards of private and public\r\n\r\nlisted  companies.  Their appointments are  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nManaging Director or Chairman of EDB, who are responsible for\r\n\r\nensuring that there is no conflict of interest.  Approval  is\r\n\r\nbased on several criteria:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, as part of work. For example, where EDB or\r\n\r\nEDBI  are co-investors; where EDB or EDBI officers, by virtue\r\n\r\nof their domain knowledge, can add value to the companies; or\r\n\r\nwhere   the   companies   specifically   ask   for   an   EDB\r\n\r\nrepresentative on their board for comfort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for networking purposes, when it helps the\r\n\r\nofficers  to  learn and understand more about the  companies,\r\n\r\nindustries,  technologies, and emerging trends, in  order  to\r\n\r\nfurther develop existing and new industry clusters;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thirdly, for career development and exposure, where\r\n\r\nsuch appointments will broaden the exposure and experience of\r\n\r\nthe officers as part of their career development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Chairman of EDB himself, Mr Philip\r\n\r\nYeo,  Members  would  be  aware  that  he  retired  from  the\r\n\r\nAdministrative  Service last year and is  currently  employed\r\n\r\ndirectly by EDB.  His employment contract specifically allows\r\n\r\nhim to accept board memberships with remuneration, subject to\r\n\r\nthere  being  no conflict of interest and with approval  from\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Trade and Industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo is currently a non-executive director in several\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  companies, including, for  example,  Infosys\r\n\r\nTechnologies which is a leading Indian IT company,  SilkRoute\r\n\r\nHoldings which is an investment holding company of e-commerce\r\n\r\nstart-ups, and United\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nOverseas Bank.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry,  in  fact\r\n\r\nthe  Minister,  approved these appointments after  satisfying\r\n\r\nitself that they did not pose any conflict of interest to  Mr\r\n\r\nYeo's  duties  in EDB and NSTB.  Should any of the  companies\r\n\r\nhave  dealings  with EDB or NSTB, for example, while  seeking\r\n\r\nGovernment  assistance or tax incentives, EDB and  NSTB  have\r\n\r\nstandard   operating  procedures  to  prevent   conflict   of\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The involvement of Ministers on company boards is\r\n\r\ngoverned  by  a  Code  of Conduct for  Ministers.   Paragraph\r\n\r\n3(iii) of the Code reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A Minister should not hold any directorship in public\r\n\r\ncompanies   or   participate  actively  in  any  professional\r\n\r\npractice.   Nor  should  he  be associated  in  a  formal  or\r\n\r\nadvisory capacity with any commercial undertaking or  receive\r\n\r\nany remuneration from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except that the Prime Minister may authorise the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  hold  such  office  or  participate  in  or  be\r\n\r\nassociated  with  any  of the aforesaid activities  where  he\r\n\r\nconsiders it in the national interest for the Minister to  do\r\n\r\nso.  The Prime Minister's authorisation shall be published in\r\n\r\nthe Gazette.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew serves on several\r\n\r\ninternational advisory boards, including Daimler-Chrysler,  J\r\n\r\nP  Morgan  and  TOTAL  which is a French  oil  major.   These\r\n\r\nappointments   have  been  invaluable  in  helping   him   to\r\n\r\nappreciate the major changes taking place in the business and\r\n\r\nfinancial world, and what Singapore must do to catch up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lee told Parliament last year (during the debate\r\n\r\non Singapore 21 on 6th May 1999), having had the advantage of\r\n\r\ntime and opportunity to attend meetings with top bankers, top\r\n\r\nexecutives in different parts of the world, he had  concluded\r\n\r\nthat  our  previous  aspiration of becoming  the  centre  for\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia  was  inadequate.  This is  a  global  stage,\r\n\r\nwhether we like it or not, and to play in this global market,\r\n\r\nwe must have talent of a global standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SM also described how having been exposed as a member of\r\n\r\nan  international advisory board of a big American  bank,  he\r\n\r\ncould  see  the speed at which they themselves were  changing\r\n\r\nand spreading\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthroughout the world, and concluded that we had no choice but\r\n\r\nto  stop  protecting our local banks from foreign competition\r\n\r\nor face the prospect of being wiped out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the next phase of our economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment,   we   will  need  to  recruit   many   talented\r\n\r\nindividuals,  in  Singapore and worldwide, to  contribute  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  ways  to our economy and society.   We  will  need\r\n\r\nspecialists  and generalists, chairmen and board  members  of\r\n\r\nstatutory boards and companies.  The distinction between GLCs\r\n\r\nand non-GLCs will become less relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be invaluable for the public sector to have\r\n\r\nofficers who understand how companies work, and are  au  fait\r\n\r\nwith  developments  in  the business world.   Allowing  civil\r\n\r\nservants  to  serve on the boards of companies will  help  to\r\n\r\nachieve  this.   There  must of course  be  proper  rules  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  against conflict of interest, and to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe   civil  servant's  primary  responsibility  and  loyalty\r\n\r\nremains to his organisation and the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector encompasses a wide range of agencies,\r\n\r\nfrom  Ministries  at  the  core of  public  policymaking,  to\r\n\r\nresearch  institutes  which are really at  the  periphery  of\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  statutory boards  which  are  somewhere  in\r\n\r\nbetween.  The appropriate rules and constraints governing the\r\n\r\nappointment of officers to boards of companies will therefore\r\n\r\nvary  for the different parts of the public sector.   PSD  is\r\n\r\nreviewing the existing rules and practices, to see  how  best\r\n\r\nwe  can achieve this flexibility in the new situation,  while\r\n\r\nupholding the integrity and ethos of the public service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, there may be no conflict of\r\n\r\ninterest where the individual civil servant is concerned, but\r\n\r\nwhere  the companies are concerned, there is a perception  in\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector that such companies  with  senior  civil\r\n\r\nservants on the board have an unfair advantage over the other\r\n\r\ncompanies.   How do you address this concern of  the  private\r\n\r\ncompanies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwithout the privilege of having senior civil servants on  the\r\n\r\nboard?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, we must\r\n\r\nmake  up our mind whether there is a problem and then  decide\r\n\r\nhow  to  deal with it if there is one.  If there is not  one,\r\n\r\nwhether there is a perception and whether there is ground for\r\n\r\nit or not.  It is not a new thing for civil servants to serve\r\n\r\non company boards.  They have done it for GLCs for many years\r\n\r\n-  DBS,  SIA, Sembawang, Keppel.  And frankly, some of  these\r\n\r\ncompanies  would not have been built up had  there  not  been\r\n\r\nvery strong and effective civil servants, like Joe Pillay  in\r\n\r\nSIA,  to run these companies and build them up into what they\r\n\r\nare today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in a new position. We could continue the old\r\n\r\nscheme  where  we make these arrangements for GLCs  and  then\r\n\r\nsay, \"For non-GLCs, you are beyond the pale.\"  Or we have  to\r\n\r\nreview  the  position and say, \"Well, it is a new  situation.\r\n\r\nWhether   you  are  a  GLC  or  not,  it  is  not  a  crucial\r\n\r\ndistinction.\"   The crucial distinction is: is  it  going  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  difference  to Singapore?  Is  it  in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest?   And  is there any conflict of interest  when  the\r\n\r\nofficer  serves  on the board?  Does he make a  contribution?\r\n\r\nIf  so,  then we work out schemes which enable us to do  this\r\n\r\nand  maintain the integrity of the civil service.  And people\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  know that if you have a civil servant  on  the\r\n\r\nboard, you do not get favours done.  Sometimes, the contrary,\r\n\r\nbecause  then, they may find out something is wrong with  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   Or  knowing that there is a civil servant  on  the\r\n\r\nboard,  the Government may be doubly cautious not to make  an\r\n\r\nexception or exercise discretion when otherwise it might have\r\n\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are issues which we have to work out. We have to\r\n\r\ntake  the steps very carefully because we have a very  strong\r\n\r\nreputation to uphold.  The integrity of the civil service and\r\n\r\nthe  ethos  of  the civil servants - that  they  are  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and that is their primary job.  There  are  other\r\n\r\nthings which they can do and which we think is good for  them\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo,  and we make arrangements, but do not forget where  their\r\n\r\nprimary  job is.  I think we want to preserve that.   But  if\r\n\r\nyou  are  in  a research institute and you have  developed  a\r\n\r\npatent,  or got a new idea, or some new protein or drug,  and\r\n\r\nyou  want to go and start up a company and profit from  this,\r\n\r\nbut  we say that you cannot do that, then the only people who\r\n\r\nare going to work in research institutes are the ones who are\r\n\r\nnot  going  to have ideas.  Because the ones who  have  ideas\r\n\r\nwill be off on their own, and there are many other places  in\r\n\r\nthe  world where these arrangements have been made and  there\r\n\r\nare  opportunities to do it, including universities like MIT,\r\n\r\nHarvard, Stanford, Cambridge or Oxford, which also have  been\r\n\r\ntrying  to  find  the  right  interface  between  where   the\r\n\r\nuniversity stands and where the private sector begins.  So we\r\n\r\nhave to find the right form.  I assure you we will try and do\r\n\r\nit very carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Minimum disclosure standards)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister, in\r\n\r\nlight  of  the  recent unsatisfactory handling  of  the  eWOS\r\n\r\ninitial public offer, if the Government will (i) ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  public  has access to minimum disclosure  standards  for\r\n\r\nfuture IPOs and (ii) intensify public education efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a long\r\n\r\nanswer but I will try and finish it within six minutes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unsatisfactory handling of the eWorld of Sports.com\r\n\r\nLimited's initial public offering was the result of a failure\r\n\r\nto  make  full and proper disclosure.  Although UOB Asia  Ltd\r\n\r\ndid  disclose United Overseas Bank Ltd's subscription  of  10\r\n\r\nmillion  eWOS shares under the public tranche, it  failed  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish these shares from those that UOB was absorbing as\r\n\r\nunderwriter.  The 1.3 times public subscription  figure  that\r\n\r\nwas  disclosed  was  misleading.

It  is  an  offence to create a  false  or  misleading\r\n\r\nappearance  in  the  market for a share  counter.   The  MAS,\r\n\r\nhaving   carefully  studied  the  text  of  the  announcement\r\n\r\npublished  in  the Straits Times on 4th August  2000  by  UOB\r\n\r\nAsia,  the  text  of the statement issued  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange on 11th August and the statement issued by UOB  Asia\r\n\r\non  14th  August  has  formed the view that  the  4th  August\r\n\r\nannouncement  was  sufficiently misleading  to  the  ordinary\r\n\r\ninvestor to justify an investigation into whether an  offence\r\n\r\nhad  been  committed under the Securities  Industry  Act,  in\r\n\r\nparticular section 99.  This section makes it an offence  for\r\n\r\nany  person knowingly to make a false or misleading statement\r\n\r\nin a material particular that is likely to induce the sale or\r\n\r\npurchase of securities by other persons or is likely to  have\r\n\r\nan  effect  in  maintaining the market price  of  securities.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,  the  MAS has referred the  matter  to  CAD  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue managers are professional advisors. If they fail\r\n\r\nto  discharge their duties to the highest standards of  care,\r\n\r\ncompetence   and  responsibility,  especially   after   being\r\n\r\nexpressly instructed by the Exchange, then they must face the\r\n\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem in the eWOS case was a deficiency in\r\n\r\nprofessional judgement and conduct, rather than a shortcoming\r\n\r\nof  the rules and regulations.  Such conduct would have  been\r\n\r\nunacceptable  even under our previous merit-based  regulatory\r\n\r\napproach,  when  companies seeking an IPO  were  screened  on\r\n\r\ntheir commercial merits.  High professional standards are all\r\n\r\nthe  more  important under a disclosure-based  regime,  where\r\n\r\ninvestors need full information to evaluate what is on offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Exchange cannot create explicit rules to cover every\r\n\r\nscenario,  or  to  pre-empt  all professional  misjudgements.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  in  the light of this incident,  the  Exchange\r\n\r\nwill review whether to prohibit underwriters from subscribing\r\n\r\nto   IPOs   that  they  underwrite,  or  to  impose  stronger\r\n\r\ndisclosure   requirements  where  they  do  subscribe.    The\r\n\r\nExchange  will  study  practices in other  developed  markets\r\n\r\nbefore deciding on the best approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has also been looking into the continuing disclosure\r\n\r\nrequirements  for  companies once  they  are  listed.   These\r\n\r\nrequirements  are  currently only non-statutory  SGX  listing\r\n\r\nrules,  not  legal requirements.  They concern the disclosure\r\n\r\nof material information regarding a company's operations, and\r\n\r\nany  matter that may materially impact its share price.   The\r\n\r\nMAS  is  studying legislation to give these requirements  the\r\n\r\nforce of law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's role in investor education is indirect.\r\n\r\nMAS  works with industry bodies and public associations  such\r\n\r\nas   the  Exchange,  Investment  Management  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  the  Securities  Investors  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  while  introducing  programmes  to  educate   the\r\n\r\npublic.   The  CPF Board also intends to educate its  members\r\n\r\nabout   the  products  available  under  the  CPF  Investment\r\n\r\nSchemes.   The  Government  encourages  industry  efforts  at\r\n\r\neducation  and  will  support  them  with  funding  from  the\r\n\r\nFinancial   Sector  Development  Fund.    But   the   primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  educating  retail  investors  lies  with\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions and their representatives, who are  in\r\n\r\ndirect contact with their clients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifting from a merit-based regime of securities\r\n\r\nregulation  to a more liberal, disclosure-based regime  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess  that  takes time.  Investors, listed companies,  and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions  need to learn  how  the  new  regime\r\n\r\nworks.   Participants  will  have  wider  latitude  to   take\r\n\r\nbusiness and market risks, and to judge the merits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  investment proposals for themselves.  But there  will  be\r\n\r\nabsolutely  no  change in the high standards of  professional\r\n\r\nconduct  demanded  of financial intermediaries,  and  in  our\r\n\r\nstrict  enforcement  of  rules and  laws  to  prevent  unfair\r\n\r\npractices and false markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that during the transition from\r\n\r\nmerit-  to  disclosure-based regimes, some participants  will\r\n\r\ntest  the  limits of what is permitted.  But I  am  confident\r\n\r\nthat  after  a  few salutary test cases, they  will  discover\r\n\r\nwhere  the  limits lie and the consequences of  transgressing\r\n\r\nthese limits, and a new balance will be established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will consider giving (i) more  varieties  of\r\n\r\nscholarships in terms of varying years of bonding and  amount\r\n\r\nof  pecuniary  involvement; (ii) prestige or  acknowledgement\r\n\r\nscholarships  with  no  monetary  involvement;    and   (iii)\r\n\r\nscholarships  with  flexible terms  like  deferment  of  bond\r\n\r\nservice for further postgraduate courses and/or training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Government\r\n\r\nscholarship today already vary in terms of the years of  bond\r\n\r\nas  well as in the pecuniary amount involved.  The number  of\r\n\r\nyears of bond associated with the scholarship depends on  the\r\n\r\ntype  of  award and country of study.  For PSC, for  example,\r\n\r\nthe  bond is six years for US and UK; five years for  France,\r\n\r\nGermany,  Japan  and  PRC;  and  four  years  for  the  local\r\n\r\nscholarships.   The amount of sponsorship also varies  across\r\n\r\ncountries, depending on the cost of the university  education\r\n\r\nas well as the cost of living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government scholarships are given for the purpose of\r\n\r\nidentifying,  inducting and grooming talent  for  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.   Thus, the Government is not in favour  of  awarding\r\n\r\nprestige  or acknowledgement scholarship without the  scholar\r\n\r\nmaking a commitment to serve in the public service.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past 5 years we have been active in\r\n\r\nreforming our legislation in Intellectual Property  or  \"IP\".\r\n\r\nWe  enacted major amendments to the Patents, Trade Marks  and\r\n\r\nCopyright  legislation.   We introduced  new  legislation  in\r\n\r\nareas   such   as  Geographical  Indications  and  Integrated\r\n\r\nCircuits.  As part of this ongoing effort to finetune our  IP\r\n\r\nlegislation, it is now timely to revise our law  relating  to\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Designs by this - the Registered Designs  Bill  - now before the House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in drafting this Bill, we consulted various\r\n\r\nrelevant  parties.   The  Intellectual  Property  Office   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  (IPOS) worked closely with the  Inter-Ministry\r\n\r\nCommittee  overseeing Singapore's compliance with  the  World\r\n\r\nTrade  Organisation's Agreement on Trade Related  Aspects  of\r\n\r\nIntellectual  Property  or \"TRIPS\".  The  Committee  includes\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the Economic Development Board  and  the\r\n\r\nTrade  Development  Board  through  which  the  industry  was\r\n\r\nconsulted.   IPOS  also  consulted the  Law  Faculty  of  the\r\n\r\nNational   University  of  Singapore,  the  Law  Society   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the World Intellectual Property  Organisation\r\n\r\n(WIPO).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, this Bill creates a registration system in\r\n\r\nSingapore for the protection of industrial designs.  It  will\r\n\r\nreplace the existing legislation - the United Kingdom Designs\r\n\r\n(Protection) Act (Cap 339) - which provides that all  designs\r\n\r\nregistered  under the United Kingdom Registered  Designs  Act\r\n\r\n1949  enjoy the same rights and privileges here,  as  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom.  Hence, currently, local designers  have  to\r\n\r\nregister  their  designs in the United Kingdom  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  protection in Singapore.  This is a circuitous,  time-consuming  and  costly  process.  It will  therefore  further\r\n\r\npromote entrepreneurship if we have our own system to protect\r\n\r\nregistered designs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A design will be accepted for registration if it is new\r\n\r\nand applied industrially.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt  will  not be accepted for registration if it is a  design\r\n\r\nthat  is  dictated  purely by the function  that  it  has  to\r\n\r\nperform.  These definitions are consistent with the  approach\r\n\r\ntaken  in  the United Kingdom.  However, in line with  recent\r\n\r\ntrends  in  other  countries, the  definition  now  does  not\r\n\r\nrequire  that the features of the design appeal  to  and  are\r\n\r\njudged  by the eye, or that aesthetic considerations must  be\r\n\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications will now be registered more expeditiously\r\n\r\nas  they  will  be examined to ensure that they  meet  formal\r\n\r\nrequirements  only.   This is similar  to  the  international\r\n\r\nsystem   of  registration  adopted  at  the  WIPO  diplomatic\r\n\r\nconference  in  1999 as reflected in the Hague Agreement  for\r\n\r\nthe  International Registration of Designs.   The  period  of\r\n\r\nprotection  for registered designs has been shortened  to  15\r\n\r\nyears from the current 25 years.  This again is in line  with\r\n\r\ntrends in other countries where the periods range from 10  to\r\n\r\n15  years.   Disputes  arising  from  the  registration,  for\r\n\r\nexample, where the registration is being contested on any  of\r\n\r\nthe  grounds  on which registration could have  been  refused\r\n\r\nwill be adjudicated by the Courts or by the Registrar of  the\r\n\r\nDesign Registry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill reflects many key provisions in other\r\n\r\nIntellectual  Property legislation.  Let  me  mention  a  few\r\n\r\nareas.   The  rights that the design registrant enjoys  under\r\n\r\nthe new Bill are similar to the rights enjoyed under other IP\r\n\r\nlegislation.   These are that he has the exclusive  right  to\r\n\r\nmake  or import into Singapore for commercial purposes,  sell\r\n\r\nor hire, articles to which his design or any design, which is\r\n\r\nsubstantially  similar  to  his  design,  has  been  applied.\r\n\r\nInfringement of this right gives him recourse to injunctions,\r\n\r\ndamages or account of profit, order for delivery up and order\r\n\r\nfor disposal of infringing articles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defences available to an alleged infringer are also\r\n\r\nsimilar to those available under other IP legislation.  It is\r\n\r\nnot an infringement if an act is done for private\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-commercial  purposes,  or  if  a  design  is   used   for\r\n\r\nevaluation, analysis, research or teaching.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government uses provisions that are similar to those\r\n\r\nin  the  Patents  Act.  The Government may use  a  registered\r\n\r\ndesign  for  the security and defence of Singapore,  for  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of civil defence measures in the  event  of  a\r\n\r\nstate of emergency or civil defence emergency and public non-commercial purposes.  Such use is ordinarily subject to terms\r\n\r\nagreed  with  the  registered  owner,  including  payment  of\r\n\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential amendments will be made to the\r\n\r\nCopyright  Act. Presently, designs which do not  qualify  for\r\n\r\nregistration  under  the  Registered  Designs  Act  may  seek\r\n\r\nprotection  under  Copyright law.  Up to  now,  they  may  be\r\n\r\nprotected under section 70 of the Copyright Act for 15 years.\r\n\r\nThis  protection has been removed as there has been  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  the related industries that there is no need to protect\r\n\r\nsuch  designs. These are usually designs for spare  parts  of\r\n\r\narticles.   This  position is similar to the  United  Kingdom\r\n\r\nwhere there is no protection for such designs.  Consequential\r\n\r\namendments  will also be made to section 74 of the  Copyright\r\n\r\nAct  to reflect the new reduced term of protection under  the\r\n\r\nnew Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, transitional provisions have been put in place\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  design  owners who had  obtained,  or  were\r\n\r\nawaiting  registrations in the United Kingdom prior  to  this\r\n\r\nAct  coming  into  force  will, under  the  new  legislation,\r\n\r\ncontinue  to enjoy their existing rights.  For example,  even\r\n\r\nthough  the term of protection is being shortened, this  will\r\n\r\nnot  affect  the owners of designs registered in the  UK  who\r\n\r\nwill continue to enjoy 25 years protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Assoc.

It  also  incorporates  six  other\r\n\r\namendments to the Income Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes Announced in the 2000 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first begin with the tax changes announced in the 2000\r\n\r\nBudget  Statement.  There are  a  total  of  seven  tax\r\n\r\nchanges  which require amending the Act.  I will  start  with\r\n\r\nthe tax changes affecting individual taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, the Government gave a one-off tax rebate to\r\n\r\nhelp  mitigate  the  impact of the  recession.   As  economic\r\n\r\nrecovery  is well underway this year, Dr Richard Hu announced\r\n\r\na one-off, across-the-board rebate of 5 percent on individual\r\n\r\nincome  tax for Year of Assessment 2000. Clause 24  provides\r\n\r\nfor the rebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide greater recognition to those who stay with\r\n\r\ntheir  parents, the relief for the maintenance of  each  aged\r\n\r\nparent  will  be  raised by $500 to $5,000.   For  those  who\r\n\r\nmaintain  their aged parents but do not stay with  them,  the\r\n\r\nrelief  will  remain at $3,500.  The change will take  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Year of Assessment 2000.  Clause 10(a) amends  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from providing for their own financial security,\r\n\r\nindividuals currently enjoy a tax relief for cash top-ups  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minimum Sum Account of their parents.  To promote inter-generational  ties and the concept of extended  families,  Dr\r\n\r\nRichard Hu had announced that this relief will also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncover top-ups in cash for grandparents with effect from  Year\r\n\r\nof  Assessment 2001. Clauses 10(b), 10(c) and 10(d) amend the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the Income Tax amendments to\r\n\r\nencourage  innovation, creativity and enterprise.  Currently,\r\n\r\nauthors,  composers and inventors can avail themselves  of  a\r\n\r\ntax  incentive which limits their taxable royalty  income  to\r\n\r\n10%   of   gross   royalties  received.   To  encourage   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  the arts and innovation in  Singapore,  this\r\n\r\nscheme is now being liberalised accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Concession for authors, composers and\r\n\r\nchoreographers\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This concession will be extended to include royalty\r\n\r\npayments received by a composer, an author or a choreographer\r\n\r\nfrom  music  recording  or film, dance  or  drama  production\r\n\r\nbusinesses  in Singapore with effect from Year of  Assessment\r\n\r\n2001.  Clause 2(a) amends the relevant section of the Act for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Concession for Inventors and Innovators\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With effect from Year of Assessment 2001, this\r\n\r\nconcession  will be extended to cover any approved  invention\r\n\r\nor innovation from the non-manufacturing sectors.  The scheme\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  extended to foreigners. To  qualify  for  the\r\n\r\nconcession,   the  work  in  developing  the   invention   or\r\n\r\ninnovation must be substantially carried out in Singapore and\r\n\r\nthe   invention  or  innovation  must  be  protectable.   The\r\n\r\nEconomic Development Board will administer the incentive.   A\r\n\r\nqualifying individual will enjoy the concession for up  to  5\r\n\r\nyears.   Clauses 2(b) and 2(c) amend the relevant section  of\r\n\r\nthe Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent announcement on 22nd May 2000, Dr Richard\r\n\r\nHu  introduced the new Entrepreneurial Employee Stock  Option\r\n\r\nScheme.   This  new scheme aims to foster an  entrepreneurial\r\n\r\nspirit in the smaller and more risky companies and its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployees,  many of whom have forgone more secure and  higher\r\n\r\npaying jobs to start or join these start-up companies.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  Entrepreneurial  Employee Stock  Option  Scheme,  a  50%\r\n\r\nincome  tax  exemption will be granted on gains arising  from\r\n\r\nthe  exercise of employee stock options, subject  to  certain\r\n\r\nconditions.  The 50% tax exemption is available for 10  years\r\n\r\nof  assessment  and for up to $10 million of  gains  derived.\r\n\r\nThis enhanced tax treatment will apply to qualifying employee\r\n\r\nstock  options granted on or after 1st June 2000.   Clause  5\r\n\r\ninserts a new section to the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to two tax changes affecting the\r\n\r\ncorporate sector.  To encourage the development of  the  swap\r\n\r\nmarket  here, the concessionary 10% tax rate will be extended\r\n\r\nto  income derived by financial institutions from trading  in\r\n\r\ninterest rate and currency swaps.  This concession will  take\r\n\r\neffect from Year of Assessment 2001 and will apply until 27th\r\n\r\nFebruary 2003.  Clause 14 amends the relevant section of  the\r\n\r\nAct for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Richard Hu had also announced in the Budget the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  the corporate tax rate by 0.5% to  25.5%  with\r\n\r\neffect   from  Year  of  Assessment  2001.   The  tax   rates\r\n\r\napplicable to other persons which are pegged to the corporate\r\n\r\ntax  rate will correspondingly be reduced to 25.5%.   Clauses\r\n\r\n9,  11, 12, 15(a), 15(c), 16, 17 and 18(a) amend the relevant\r\n\r\nsections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax Changes Not Announced in the 2000 Budget Statement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other tax changes not announced\r\n\r\nin the 2000 Budget Statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first tax change pertains to the Qualified Employee\r\n\r\nStock Option Plan Scheme which was announced in October  last\r\n\r\nyear.   Under the scheme, the payment of tax on gains arising\r\n\r\nfrom certain qualifying stock options can be deferred for up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto five years, subject to an interest charge.  The Income Tax\r\n\r\nAct  is thus amended to empower the Comptroller of Income Tax\r\n\r\nto  extend  the  time for payment of tax on  such  gains  and\r\n\r\nimpose  interest for the deferment of tax payment under  this\r\n\r\nScheme.   Clauses  19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 amend  the  relevant\r\n\r\nsections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second tax change pertains to share buyback through\r\n\r\nSpecial  Trading Counters (STC) established on the  Singapore\r\n\r\nExchange.   The  Income Tax Act is amended  to  deem  certain\r\n\r\npayment  made  by  a  company resident in  Singapore  to  its\r\n\r\nshareholders, pursuant to a share buyback through an STC,  to\r\n\r\nbe  a  payment  of  dividend by the company and,  in  certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances,   to  be  a  receipt  of  dividends   by   its\r\n\r\nshareholders.  Clauses 3, 15(b) and 18(b) amend the  relevant\r\n\r\nsections of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1998 Budget, Dr Richard Hu announced a temporary\r\n\r\nsuspension  of the annual limits on tax deduction for  banks'\r\n\r\ngeneral  provisions of 25% of qualifying profits and 0.5%  of\r\n\r\nqualifying  loans and investments for a period of  two  years\r\n\r\n(Year  of  Assessment  1998  and Year  of  Assessment  1999).\r\n\r\nClause  7 amends the relevant section of the Act to reinstate\r\n\r\nthese annual limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tax change amends the Act to enable certain\r\n\r\ndiesel  driven  vehicles  which  are  affected  by  the  Land\r\n\r\nTransport  Authority's goods vehicle classification  exercise\r\n\r\nto  qualify  for the one year accelerated capital  allowance.\r\n\r\nClause  8  amends the relevant section of the  Act  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st December 1999, the Stock Exchange of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  SIMEX were demutualised and became subsidiaries of a new\r\n\r\nholding company known as the Singapore Exchange.  The  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Act is amended to reflect the change of name from  SIMEX\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  Exchange  Derivatives  Trading  Limited.   The\r\n\r\nexisting tax exemption on certain income of the company  will\r\n\r\ncontinue until 31st December 2003.  The Act is also amended\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  allow tax exemption of dividends paid out of these exempt\r\n\r\nprofits  of  the company, subject to certain conditions.   In\r\n\r\naddition,   the  restructuring  will  not  affect   the   10%\r\n\r\nconcessionary  rate  of  tax  applicable  to  certain  income\r\n\r\nderived  by  any  company which was a member  of  the  former\r\n\r\nSIMEX.   Clauses 4, 5 and 13 amend the relevant  sections  of\r\n\r\nthe Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the last tax change pertains to the tax\r\n\r\ntreatment  of  CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) investments.   A\r\n\r\nCPF  member  may  use CPF savings to purchase  units  in  any\r\n\r\napproved  CPF  unit trust.  Currently, certain  interest  and\r\n\r\nforeign dividends distributed by such CPF unit trust are tax-exempt.  However, once the units purchased by the CPF  member\r\n\r\nare  transferred to him when he is entitled to  withdraw  his\r\n\r\nCPF   moneys,  his  investment  in  those  units  should   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  as not falling within the CPF Investment  Scheme.\r\n\r\nAny income arising henceforth from such investment should  be\r\n\r\nsubject to the normal tax treatment.  Clause 2(d) amends  the\r\n\r\nrelevant section of the Act for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to support this Bill.  In fact, the amendments have been\r\n\r\ndebated   previously   and  quite   thoroughly   during   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  2000 Budget session.  Similarly,  the  proposed\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme was also debated\r\n\r\npreviously  in  this House when Dr Richard Hu  announced  the\r\n\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to take this opportunity to raise a\r\n\r\nquery  on  the Entrepreneurial Employee Stock Option  Scheme.\r\n\r\nIn  clause  13J  (4)  of the Bill, it is  specified  that  to\r\n\r\nqualify for the tax benefit, both the company and the holding\r\n\r\ncompany  have  to be incorporated in Singapore.   I  wish  to\r\n\r\npoint  out that this rule of both the company and the holding\r\n\r\ncompany having to be incorporated in Singapore will mean that\r\n\r\nseveral Singaporeans or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresidents   who  are  working  in  companies  whose   holding\r\n\r\ncompanies are not incorporated in Singapore will be  excluded\r\n\r\nfrom  this scheme and therefore unable to enjoy this benefit.\r\n\r\nThere  are also several high tech companies which could  have\r\n\r\ntheir parent companies incorporated overseas, eg, foreign  US\r\n\r\ncompanies  setting up a base here.  And because they  may  be\r\n\r\noffered stock options of their parent companies' stocks which\r\n\r\ncould eventually be listed on the NASDAQ, therefore they  are\r\n\r\nunable  to  enjoy this benefit when the company gets  listed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  these  foreign companies setting up  operations  in\r\n\r\nSingapore actually will create employment and other  benefits\r\n\r\nto  us.   They  will  also  add  to  the  overall  high  tech\r\n\r\ninnovative and creative environment that the Government wants\r\n\r\nto  create.  Hence, I would like to ask the Minister  whether\r\n\r\nwe  should  consider  how to incorporate  amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nscheme,  whereby persons working in foreign holding companies\r\n\r\nof local companies can also enjoy this benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I  support the Income  Tax  (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Finance Minister to give legislative effect\r\n\r\nto  some  of  the  tax reduction measures announced  in  this\r\n\r\nyear's  Budget  Statement.  This includes reducing  corporate\r\n\r\ntax  by  0.5%  to 25.5% with effect from Year  of  Assessment\r\n\r\n2001.   The reduction of corporate tax is mainly to  maintain\r\n\r\nour  competitiveness and to attract foreign investment.  This\r\n\r\nis a policy of great urgency.  Yet the Government is delaying\r\n\r\nuntil  the next fiscal year to implement it.  People  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community  are  not happy because  they  could  not\r\n\r\nderive any immediate benefit for this reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the statistics recently released by the Government\r\n\r\nthrough  the media, the total tax revenue for the first  half\r\n\r\nof  this year was as much as $15.5 billion, an increase of $3\r\n\r\nbillion or 24% compared to last year.  This is the result  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic  recovery and also the contributions  from  the\r\n\r\nenterprises  and the people through payment  of  the  various\r\n\r\ntaxes.  This very substantial tax revenue is taken from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsociety.  It should be used on society.  As such, I  am  very\r\n\r\nhappy  with Prime Minister Goh's announcement at the National\r\n\r\nDay  Rally that the Government has proposed a package of $3.2\r\n\r\nbillion  to  implement  a  series  of  measures  relating  to\r\n\r\neducation, training, baby bonus, elderly fund and the CPF top-ups,  etc,  to  develop Singapore into a  more  cohesive  and\r\n\r\ncompetitive  nation,  and to help our people  deal  with  the\r\n\r\nchallenges in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From PM Goh's speech and the policies announced, we can\r\n\r\nsee  the  Government's strong confidence  in  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and its compassion and willingness  to  help  the\r\n\r\nlower-income group and the elderly people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Government's policy of high salaries to\r\n\r\nattract  the  talented and hefty remuneration to  retain  the\r\n\r\nable,  we  are  pleased to learn of PM Goh's circumspect  and\r\n\r\nfarsighted views.  I hope that the Government will  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to continue thinking and deliberating on this  matter\r\n\r\nand  to propose constructive suggestions, so that people from\r\n\r\nall  walks of life will actively participate in this exercise\r\n\r\nand to derive benefits from there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is also very optimistic\r\n\r\nabout  the  economic performance of Singapore in  the  second\r\n\r\nhalf  of  this year.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry  has\r\n\r\nadjusted the growth rate forecast upwards from 7.5% to  8.5%.\r\n\r\nThis  shows  that the Government would have more tax  revenue\r\n\r\nand  considerable  budget surplus to  implement  the  various\r\n\r\nproposed policies and projects, unlike in the private  sector\r\n\r\nwhere  people  are for lack of funds less daring  to  venture\r\n\r\ninto new investment items.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, looking from another angle, has the Government\r\n\r\nbecome  complacent?  Is the Government too persistent in  its\r\n\r\ntax  policies and unwilling to reduce corporate tax,  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers'  levy,  vehicle taxes, property tax  and  the  other\r\n\r\ntaxes which affect our business costs?  As the Prime\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  said,  we  are running into the  risk  of  being  a\r\n\r\ncomplacent  \"incumbent\".  Because of our past  successes,  we\r\n\r\nmay  dangerously hope that the past formula will continue  to\r\n\r\nwork  for us in the future.  I hope that the Finance Minister\r\n\r\nand  the  elite  in  IRAS will heed PM's valuable  advice  to\r\n\r\nreform  our  tax system in a more innovative and  enlightened\r\n\r\nattitude  and be in consultation with the business community,\r\n\r\nand  try  their  best  to  lighten  the  tax  burden  of  the\r\n\r\nenterprises,  big  or small, so that  they  could  accumulate\r\n\r\nadequate   capital  to  venture  into  high-risk   innovative\r\n\r\nbusinesses or long-term large-scale investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all along, Singapore has been labelled a \"shoppers'\r\n\r\nparadise\".   This is mainly because Singapore is a  duty-free\r\n\r\nzone.   If  we  can  go one step further to adopt  a  low-tax\r\n\r\nstrategy  in developing Singapore into a \"business paradise\",\r\n\r\nthen  we will instill more confidence in our people to  start\r\n\r\nand  develop their business and be better placed  to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign talents and capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Government's explanation, Government's\r\n\r\nimplementation of the policy of high salaries for the able is\r\n\r\nfor  the sake of Singapore's future, mainly to attract enough\r\n\r\ntalents  to  go  into  politics and to be  senior  Government\r\n\r\nofficials.   This policy has great impact on the enterprises.\r\n\r\nThis  is something that we cannot overlook.   Generally,  the\r\n\r\npeople's  response to this policy is that before  they  could\r\n\r\nsee  benefit  coming from it, the adverse effect  is  already\r\n\r\nfelt.  From the experience that we have learnt from the Asian\r\n\r\nfinancial policy, we greatly appreciate the importance of our\r\n\r\ncost  competitiveness as a basic ingredient to  the  survival\r\n\r\nand development of our businesses.  We were able to tide over\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  financial crisis simply because we were  able  to\r\n\r\nimplement  the cost-cutting package effectively in  the  true\r\n\r\nspirit  of tripartism.  The most effective part of the  cost-cutting   package   is   the  cut  in  the   employers'   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  and  the  employees'  wages.   These  measures\r\n\r\nproduced almost immediate effects in reducing the pressure of\r\n\r\nwage-increases and retrenchment.  However,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  the recent announcement of hefty pay rise for Ministers\r\n\r\nand  senior civil servants and the rush of various Government\r\n\r\ndepartments   to   increase   their   staff   salaries,   the\r\n\r\nenterprises,  especially the SMEs are once again  faced  with\r\n\r\nthe  strong  pressure to raise the wages for  their  workers.\r\n\r\nThis   is  even  more  severe  than  the  pre-crisis   level.\r\n\r\nMoreover,   Government  has  already   announced   the   part\r\n\r\nrestoration of employers' CPF contributions early next  year.\r\n\r\nThis has caused anxiety and worry to many businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest worry among our businessmen is that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  raise its various taxes to  pay  for  these\r\n\r\nhefty  increases in salaries.  This will result in a  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle of increasing business cost, thereby causing an erosion\r\n\r\nin our regional competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not take appropriate preventive measures, this\r\n\r\nwill  result  in the loss of confidence among  our  potential\r\n\r\ninvestors, much to our detriment.  Just not too long  ago,  a\r\n\r\nreputable   international  shipping  company  relocated   its\r\n\r\noperational base to a neighbouring country in order  to  save\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, once again, I would urge the Government to\r\n\r\ntake  into  consideration  the huge  pressure  faced  by  the\r\n\r\nenterprises in terms of wages and business cost, and try  its\r\n\r\nbest  to  reduce the rates of the various existing  business-related  taxes,  and provide more incentives  to  assist  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of SMEs so that the business community can  share\r\n\r\nthe  fruits of the economic recovery together with the  civil\r\n\r\nservants and employees in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would also urge the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider   exempting   non-profit   making   industrial   and\r\n\r\ncommercial associations,  clan associations and other  ethnic\r\n\r\nand  religious bodies from the payment of income tax.   These\r\n\r\ncivic  organisations can be said to be strong pillars of  our\r\n\r\nsocial  development.  They not only cater for  the  needs  of\r\n\r\ntheir  respective members but also assist the  Government  in\r\n\r\ndeveloping Singapore into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  stable,  prosperous and cohesive society.  Exemption  from\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of  income  tax  will  surely  encourage  these\r\n\r\norganisations to work harder to raise funds and to accumulate\r\n\r\nmore capital to implement longer term development and welfare\r\n\r\nscheme to make further contributions to Singapore's community\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nthe two Members for their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in response to Mr Leong's query, Dr Richard Hu\r\n\r\nexplained    this   previously   when   we   discussed    the\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurial Employee Stock Option Scheme.  Basically,  we\r\n\r\nare  putting  this scheme in place not just  to  benefit  the\r\n\r\nindividual  but also to anchor the activities  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  to  qualify  for the  scheme,  the  company  must\r\n\r\ndemonstrate   that  substantial  activities   are   done   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Dr  Richard Hu explained then that  we  want  to\r\n\r\nstart  off by having both companies and the holding companies\r\n\r\nincorporated in Singapore and then they automatically qualify\r\n\r\nfor  the  ESOP.  However, if they can demonstrate  that  even\r\n\r\nthough  they are not incorporated in Singapore and that  they\r\n\r\nhave  substantial activities in Singapore, Dr Richard Hu said\r\n\r\nthat  he  was  prepared to consider this  on  a  case-by-case\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank Mr Tay Beng Chuan for his\r\n\r\nviews.  This is an early start to next year's budget. I  will\r\n\r\nconvey  his  views  to  the Ministry  of  Finance  for  their\r\n\r\nevaluation  for the next budget, but let me just  respond  in\r\n\r\ngeneral terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the tax burden in Singapore is not onerous. The\r\n\r\ntax incidence is actually quite light.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to balance business cost versus a fair\r\n\r\nand competitive remuneration to our workers.  Although we  do\r\n\r\nappreciate  the business community's concern about  cost,  we\r\n\r\nmust   also   ensure  that  there  is  fair  and  competitive\r\n\r\nremuneration to our workers.  Therefore, the whole idea is to\r\n\r\nstrike this balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I would like to assure Mr Tay that the Government\r\n\r\nwill  not  have to impose tax increases to pay for  the  wage\r\n\r\nrise for the civil service.  This is well within our budget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that we are not complacent. We\r\n\r\nare  looking at the overall tax regime in Singapore.  We know\r\n\r\nwe  have to be competitive.  But at the same time, we have to\r\n\r\ndistinguish the two trends that we are facing.   One  is  the\r\n\r\ncyclical trend.  Because the economy is doing well, one would\r\n\r\nexpect the tax collection to increase during this cycle.  The\r\n\r\nsecond  is  the  structural trend.  We know that  because  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  competition,  and  changes  in  the  economy,\r\n\r\ncertain  tax collections would change over time.   Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  must  be prepared for it.  Similarly, Singapore's society\r\n\r\nis also undergoing restructuring.  We will need to spend more\r\n\r\nnot just on education but on life-long learning.  We need  to\r\n\r\nspend more on health and many other competing demands.  So we\r\n\r\nneed to balance our tax collections with our tax expenditure.\r\n\r\nBut  as  I  said,  this is still early days before  the  next\r\n\r\nbudget.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before the House seeks to revise and\r\n\r\nstrengthen the law in respect of building control by:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) strengthening the system of accredited checkers in\r\n\r\ntheir role in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchecking  structural plans submitted to the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nBuilding Control;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) imposing, on the appropriate qualified person, a\r\n\r\nduty  to  ensure that the structure of a building is designed\r\n\r\naccording to prescribed requirements; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) clarifying the intended role of site supervisors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, following the collapse of the roof of\r\n\r\nthe  uncompleted Compassvale Primary School hall in June last\r\n\r\nyear, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) conducted\r\n\r\na  review  of  its  accredited checkers  system.  The  system\r\n\r\nrequires all structural plans and calculations to be  checked\r\n\r\nby   an  independent  accredited  checker  before  they   are\r\n\r\nsubmitted  to  BCA  for  approval.  BCA  also  examined   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Building Control Act to  evaluate  their\r\n\r\nadequacy in ensuring that our buildings are designed to  safe\r\n\r\nstandards  and  that  these  plans  are  checked.  The   main\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill arose from the review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now explain the proposed amendments in\r\n\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening the Accredited Checkers System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accredited checkers system was introduced into the\r\n\r\nBuilding  Control  Act in 1989, following the  Commission  of\r\n\r\nInquiry on the collapse of the Hotel New World.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission had recommended that there should be a\r\n\r\nmandatory  requirement  to  check the  structural  plans  and\r\n\r\ndesign  of  a building, so as to minimise the risk of  errors\r\n\r\narising from lapses on the part of the designer. A system  of\r\n\r\nindependent checks by an accredited checker was put in  place\r\n\r\nsince then.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its review, the BCA concluded that the current system\r\n\r\nof  accredited checkers remains valid and is an efficient and\r\n\r\ncost-effective  way to achieve an independent  check  on  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  design. However, the BCA highlighted two  areas  in\r\n\r\nthe present system which should be strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will elaborate on these areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Resources of the Accredited Checker</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, an accredited checker can check any project,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  its  size and complexity and  the  amount  of\r\n\r\ntechnical  supporting resources that he has.  BCA's  view  is\r\n\r\nthat  an  accredited checker taking on a  large  and  complex\r\n\r\nbuilding  project  should  have  more  specialised  technical\r\n\r\nsupport staff and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill addresses this issue by requiring\r\n\r\nan  accredited  checker  undertaking  large  projects  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered  and  to  operate within  an  accredited  checking\r\n\r\norganisation  that has certain resources as required  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of Building Control. The requirements  will  be\r\n\r\nprescribed  in the Regulations.  These include minimum  staff\r\n\r\nstrength, amount of professional liability insurance  and  an\r\n\r\nISO  certification.  Only accredited  checking  organisations\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to check plans of building  works  above  a\r\n\r\nprescribed  value. The value is set at $10 million  initially\r\n\r\nbut it may be adjusted from time to time to allow for changes\r\n\r\nin  construction  cost. Individual accredited  checkers  will\r\n\r\nonly  be  allowed to check building works below  this  value.\r\n\r\nThey  will  be required to be covered by a minimum amount  of\r\n\r\nprofessional liability insurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insurance is intended to provide for financial\r\n\r\nclaims  made by the public who may suffer personal injury  or\r\n\r\nloss caused by the negligence of the accredited checker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasise that the accredited\r\n\r\nchecker  is still personally responsible for the checking  of\r\n\r\nplans   and   design   calculations,  whether   he   operates\r\n\r\nindividually  or within an accredited checking  organisation.\r\n\r\nHe cannot delegate this responsibility to his assistants.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Review of the Accredited Checker's performance</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area that should be strengthened relates to the\r\n\r\nneed for a regular review of the performance of an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccredited   checker.   Under   the   present   system,   the\r\n\r\nregistration  of  an accredited checker is  valid  for  life,\r\n\r\nunless  he breaches his duty. There is no provision to review\r\n\r\nhis performance regularly after his registration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amended section 16 and new section 16A will\r\n\r\nrequire   the  accredited  checker  or  accredited   checking\r\n\r\norganisation  to  renew their registration periodically.  The\r\n\r\nregistration will be valid for one year, but this period  can\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed  in  the  future if some other  time  frame  for\r\n\r\nrenewal is deemed more suitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment also allows the Commissioner of Building\r\n\r\nControl  to  suspend  or  cancel  the  registration   of   an\r\n\r\naccredited   checker  or  accredited  checking  organisation.\r\n\r\nThese  offences could include situations where the accredited\r\n\r\nchecker  has been censured, fined, suspended or de-registered\r\n\r\nby  the Professional Engineers Board, where he has failed  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the prescribed requirements for registration and  where\r\n\r\nhis  performance failed to meet the standards  prescribed  in\r\n\r\nthe   Regulations.  During  the  period  of  suspension,  the\r\n\r\naccredited  checker or organisation will not  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\npractise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 16A, 16B, 16C and 18A extend the\r\n\r\nexisting  provisions  relating to the  individual  accredited\r\n\r\nchecker  to  the  accredited  checking  organisations.  These\r\n\r\nprovisions include the registration procedures, suspension or\r\n\r\ncancellation  of  registration procedures,  the  avenues  for\r\n\r\nappeals  against  decisions  taken  by  the  Commissioner  of\r\n\r\nBuilding Control and the requirement to maintain professional\r\n\r\nand  financial  independence  in  the  building  works  being\r\n\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Exemption of Government buildings</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 18B allows the Minister to exempt\r\n\r\nbuildings  and  building  works carried  out  by  the  public\r\n\r\nauthorities   from  certain  requirements  of   the   revised\r\n\r\naccredited  checkers  system.  With  the  exemption,   public\r\n\r\nauthorities with the necessary qualified accredited  checkers\r\n\r\nin-house need not appoint an accredited\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchecking organisation for building works above the prescribed\r\n\r\nvalue.   These in-house accredited checkers will also not  be\r\n\r\nsubjected  to  the  requirement of  checking  only  plans  of\r\n\r\nbuilding works below the prescribed value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, the accredited\r\n\r\nchecking  organisation  is  introduced  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\naccredited  checker  has adequate and appropriate  staff  and\r\n\r\nresources.    Public  authorities  like   the   Housing   and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  and the Land Transport Authority  already\r\n\r\nhave  the professional support staff and resources, and  good\r\n\r\ninternal  control and disciplinary measures  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ntheir in-house accredited checkers carry out proper checks on\r\n\r\ndesigns.  However, if the public authorities appoint external\r\n\r\naccredited  checkers, they will be subjected to the  relevant\r\n\r\nprovisions in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Design Duty of the Qualified Persons</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the accredited checker, it is also very\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  qualified person be  appraised  of  his\r\n\r\nduties  and  responsibilities under the Building Control  Act\r\n\r\nand   its  Regulations,  and  carry  out  such  duties   with\r\n\r\nprofessionalism and due diligence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the maximum penalty for a design offence\r\n\r\ncommitted by the qualified person is a fine of not more  than\r\n\r\n$5,000 or an imprisonment of not more than six months or both\r\n\r\nunder the Building Control Regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, an accredited checker who fails to\r\n\r\ndetect the same design offence will face a penalty of  up  to\r\n\r\n$50,000  in  fines  (10 times the amount  for  the  qualified\r\n\r\nperson) or an imprisonment of not more than one year or  both\r\n\r\nunder  the  Building  Control Act.   The  difference  in  the\r\n\r\npenalties  suggests that, in the design of  a  building,  the\r\n\r\naccredited checker carries a much heavier responsibility than\r\n\r\nthat of the qualified person.  This clearly cannot be so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the qualified person must carry the\r\n\r\nprimary responsibility of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensuring the integrity of his design, as he is the one  doing\r\n\r\nthe design in the first place.  He must not be lulled into  a\r\n\r\nfalse  sense of complacency that the accredited checker  will\r\n\r\nbe there to spot his mistakes, and therefore there is no need\r\n\r\nfor  him  to  check his own work for errors.   The  qualified\r\n\r\nperson  must exercise due diligence in ensuring the integrity\r\n\r\nof  his work.  The accredited checker only acts as the  final\r\n\r\nmechanism  in  the system to check and detect any  lapses  in\r\n\r\ndesign.   Ideally,  if  the qualified  person  exercises  due\r\n\r\ndiligence  in his design, the accredited checker  should  not\r\n\r\ndetect any design faults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 9 of the Act therefore seeks to\r\n\r\nmake clear the importance of the role of the qualified person\r\n\r\nin  his  design duties.  It proposes to impose a duty on  the\r\n\r\nqualified  person to take reasonable steps and  exercise  due\r\n\r\ndiligence  in  ensuring  that  the  structural  design  of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  meets  the  specified  requirements.   The  maximum\r\n\r\npenalty for a breach of this duty is a fine of up to $100,000\r\n\r\nor  an imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both.  This is\r\n\r\nmore  severe  than  the maximum penalty that  the  accredited\r\n\r\nchecker  could  face  in order to reflect  that  the  primary\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  building  design  rests   with   the\r\n\r\nqualified person.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Site Supervisors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn now to the amendments in this\r\n\r\nBill  that  concern site supervisors.  Site supervisors  were\r\n\r\nintroduced  into the Building Control Act when it  was  first\r\n\r\nenacted  in 1989.  The intention was, and still is,  for  the\r\n\r\nsite  supervisor  to  assist  the  qualified  person  in  his\r\n\r\nsupervisory duties of construction work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current section 8 of the Building Control Act\r\n\r\nstipulates  that construction works can only be  carried  out\r\n\r\nunder   the  full-time  supervision  of  a  site  supervisor.\r\n\r\nHowever,   there  has  been  some  misconception  that   site\r\n\r\nsupervisors can work independently of the qualified person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of this Bill seeks to eliminate this ambiguity\r\n\r\nby making it clear in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  8  of  the Act that construction  works  are  to  be\r\n\r\nsupervised  by  the  qualified person, or a  site  supervisor\r\n\r\nappointed  by  the  qualified person and  working  under  the\r\n\r\nqualified person's control and supervision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, the amendments to the Building\r\n\r\nControl  Act in this Bill will strengthen the legislation  on\r\n\r\nthe structural safety of buildings in Singapore.  It will re-emphasize  the  proper  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious professionals involved in the design and checking  of\r\n\r\nbuildings.    Finally,  it  will  ensure  that  the   highest\r\n\r\nstandards  are  observed  by all  who  are  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding and construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nBuilding Control (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collapse of the roof at Compassvale School last year\r\n\r\nwas  a  shock  to  many of us, as we are  known  to  be  very\r\n\r\nstringent  in our building control and regulations.   In  the\r\n\r\naftermath of the incident, we have been told that  it  was  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  human  error: firstly, the design  error  of  the\r\n\r\nprofessional  engineer;  and secondly,  the  failure  of  the\r\n\r\naccredited checker to spot the error.  We are told that  this\r\n\r\nis  the current system and that this system of the accredited\r\n\r\nchecker checking on the work of the professional engineer  is\r\n\r\nsufficiently stringent.  I can agree with that.  What we need\r\n\r\nare  competent and diligent professionals who take their jobs\r\n\r\nseriously  and not by adding another layer of  checkers.   In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  therefore, I support what the Bill proposes,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is to ensure that professional engineers and accredited\r\n\r\ncheckers  exercise due diligence in their design and checking\r\n\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the measure to require accredited checkers to renew\r\n\r\ntheir registration annually or after any period prescribed by\r\n\r\nthe Minister, I think there is a need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto balance the desire of control over administrative cost and\r\n\r\nconvenience.   The  present registration  of  the  accredited\r\n\r\nchecker  is  for life.  This new measure is a drastic  change\r\n\r\nand  I  am  not sure whether it is entirely necessary,  given\r\n\r\nthat  the  Minister today already has the power to deregister\r\n\r\nany  errant accredited checker at any time.  I think  renewal\r\n\r\nof  registration for everyone in three to five years  may  be\r\n\r\nmore  appropriate and reasonable.  Using the  same  argument,\r\n\r\nfor  example,  what  about  doctors  and  lawyers  and  other\r\n\r\nprofessionals?   Do we need to require them  to  renew  their\r\n\r\nregistration  simply because one or two of  their  kind  have\r\n\r\nbeen   negligent?   Can  the  Minister  tell  us   how   much\r\n\r\nadministrative  cost  would  be involved  in  requiring  such\r\n\r\nrenewals on a yearly basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the new provisions allow individual accredited\r\n\r\ncheckers  to  check  building works below $10  million  only.\r\n\r\nChecking  of  plans of building works above $10  million  can\r\n\r\nonly  be  given  to accredited checking organisations.   This\r\n\r\nassumes  that the organisations would have more resources  to\r\n\r\ndo  higher  value  added work.  This new  requirement  is  of\r\n\r\nconcern  to the individual accredited checkers, as  it  would\r\n\r\nreduce  their  business to some extent.  My question  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister is whether individual accredited checkers have  been\r\n\r\nfound  to  be  less  able  to  handle  bigger  projects  than\r\n\r\norganisations.   For  example, when we  see  a  doctor  or  a\r\n\r\nlawyer,  we  seldom ask how many partners or directors  there\r\n\r\nare in the company.  We base our decision on the professional\r\n\r\nreputation of that person whom we are employing or seeing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amendment Bill, the maximum penalty for the\r\n\r\nqualified  person  for breach of duty has  been  raised  from\r\n\r\n$50,000  and/or  a  jail  term not  exceeding  12  months  to\r\n\r\n$100,000.   This is double the maximum penalty for breach  of\r\n\r\nduty  by the accredited checker, and this is meant to reflect\r\n\r\nthat the primary responsibility of building designs lies with\r\n\r\nthe  qualified  person  and not the accredited  checker.   In\r\n\r\nprinciple,  I can understand the rationale for  this.   I  am\r\n\r\ntold  by  the professionals in this industry that  this  Bill\r\n\r\ndoes not give\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecognition  to  the  fact that contractors  should  be  held\r\n\r\nequally  responsible.   The  QP  or  designer  can  only   be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  design.   The  contractors  should  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for the construction.  Proper structural  design\r\n\r\nand  proper  construction are both necessary ingredients  for\r\n\r\nthe safety of the building.  This is especially important for\r\n\r\nthe  design-and-build projects where the contractors take the\r\n\r\nlead   in  a  construction  team  which  even  includes   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  a  QP and the payment  of  his  fees.   This\r\n\r\namendment Bill does not seem to address this concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate but related matter, there is concern from\r\n\r\nprofessionals  in the construction and building  sector  that\r\n\r\nthe  public sector is relying too much on competitive bidding\r\n\r\nor lower pricing to select professionals for Government jobs.\r\n\r\nThis  method  may level down the industry and  contribute  to\r\n\r\nshoddy  work.   The  local professionals would  like  to  see\r\n\r\nselection based more on quality of work and design.  I  would\r\n\r\nappreciate it if the Minister can comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these comments, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nraise  the  following concerns which the proposed  amendments\r\n\r\nwould  affect  the construction industry and  eventually  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, the proposed amendments seek to fine-tune\r\n\r\nthe  Accredited Checker Scheme and increase the  penalty  for\r\n\r\nbreach of duty by the accredited checker.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of accredited checker was introduced after\r\n\r\nthe collapse of Hotel New World in 1986 and now, we are again\r\n\r\namending  the  Building Control Act due to  the  collapse  of\r\n\r\nCompassvale  Primary  School.  It  seems  like  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  is a reactive rather than a holistic  approach  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  safety  of  building  works.   May  I  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister, by amending the Act, how can we assure the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngeneral  public that our buildings are safe and  structurally\r\n\r\nsound?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is probably one of the very few countries in\r\n\r\nthe  world  that  implements the accredited  checking  system\r\n\r\nwhereby it is mandatory for an accredited checker, who  is  a\r\n\r\nprofessional   engineer,  to  check  the  work   of   another\r\n\r\nprofessional   engineer.   Obviously,  this   double-checking\r\n\r\nsystem  results  in unnecessary duplication  of  professional\r\n\r\nwork,  contributing to construction productivity  losses  and\r\n\r\nmanpower wastages in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be argued that the structural soundness of\r\n\r\nbuildings concerns public safety, hence the need for  double-checking.  But this approach may not effectively enhance  the\r\n\r\nsafety  standards  and professionalism  in  the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  Sir, we need to examine the root cause leading  to\r\n\r\nthe design of structurally unsound buildings.  If the problem\r\n\r\nlies  in  the  lack of competence of professional  engineers,\r\n\r\nthen we should address the issue of increasing the stringency\r\n\r\nof  laws governing the registration of engineers or reviewing\r\n\r\nthe professional training of engineers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the accredited checker and professional engineer\r\n\r\nare  registered  under the same Professional  Engineers  Act.\r\n\r\nSo,  why not put the professional engineer solely responsible\r\n\r\nfor  his  own actions?  Raising the registration requirements\r\n\r\nand   imposing  penalty  for  malpractice  to  ensure  higher\r\n\r\nstandards of professional practice could achieve this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if the root cause of designing structurally\r\n\r\nunsound  buildings  lies  in  the  quality  of  training  and\r\n\r\nregistration  system of professional engineers in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthen  how  does the \"double checking\" system ensure that  the\r\n\r\naccredited  checker will not commit the same mistake  as  the\r\n\r\nprofessional engineer?  This is exactly what happened in  the\r\n\r\nCompassvale School's roof collapse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry to explore other\r\n\r\noptions   which   will   instill   professionalism   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindustry.   We  need  to have a system whereby  professionals\r\n\r\ntake responsibility for their professional work, and face the\r\n\r\nconsequences  for failing to perform their work  competently.\r\n\r\nA  system  that instills professionalism (ie, one  who  takes\r\n\r\nresponsibility for his own actions) will go a longer way than\r\n\r\na  system that creates mistrust (ie, one who doubts  his  own\r\n\r\nstandard  of work) and distrust (ie, one professional  having\r\n\r\nto check on another professional's standard of work).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the accredited checker scheme needs to be\r\n\r\nreviewed, as it may not provide a holistic solution to having\r\n\r\nstructurally sound buildings in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, construction practitioners have raised\r\n\r\nconcerns that the accredited checker system has increased the\r\n\r\ncost   of  construction,  and  also  caused  a  shortage   of\r\n\r\nprofessional engineers in Singapore.  The increased  cost  of\r\n\r\nconstruction   is   eventually   transferred   to    property\r\n\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now request for some clarifications on a few\r\n\r\namended clauses in the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New sections 8(1) and 10 insert the words \"the\r\n\r\nappropriate  qualified person\".  May I ask the  Minister:  is\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"appropriate\" necessary?   If  yes,  what  is  the\r\n\r\ndistinction between an \"appropriate qualified person\"  and  a\r\n\r\n\"qualified person\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 16 sets the prescribed limit to be $10\r\n\r\nmillion  for  building works that require the appointment  of\r\n\r\naccredited checking organisation.  May I ask the Minister  on\r\n\r\nwhat  basis is this limit derived?  Why is there  a  need  to\r\n\r\nprescribe  a  limit for an accredited organisation  to  check\r\n\r\nonly buildings of a certain value if safety of the public  is\r\n\r\nat risk?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, new section 16 also defines the \"value of\r\n\r\nbuilding works\" which means the total cost to be expended  in\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  the  building  works  (including  foundations,\r\n\r\nstructural  frame,  finishes and installation  of  services).\r\n\r\nHowever, we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleft  out  \"walls  and slabs\" as part of building  works.   I\r\n\r\npropose that we insert the words \"walls and slabs\" after  the\r\n\r\nwords \"structural frame\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I welcome this\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill  to the Building Control  Act.   We  must  do\r\n\r\neverything  we  can  to  ensure the  safety  of  construction\r\n\r\nworkers.   It is too often, in the past years, that  whenever\r\n\r\nwe  opened the morning paper, we read that some accident  had\r\n\r\nhappened at a local construction site.  If that type of  news\r\n\r\nis  allowed to continue, very soon Singaporeans will begin to\r\n\r\nfeel  that  it is another piece of news.  We become  used  to\r\n\r\nthat kind of news.  We become callous and unfeeling.  But, in\r\n\r\nactual  fact,  lives are lost every time a  serious  accident\r\n\r\ntakes  place  at a construction site.  Those  who  have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  lives are human beings and they are also the  husbands\r\n\r\nor  fathers or sons of some foreigners.  We must be  made  to\r\n\r\nrealise  that  the  loss  of lives of foreign  workers  means\r\n\r\nsadness  and  hardship  inflicted on  their  loved  ones  and\r\n\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that developed countries, like Australia,\r\n\r\ntake  the  loss of life in the building site very  seriously.\r\n\r\nThat  was  one  of the reasons cited why units in  high  rise\r\n\r\nflats  in  the inner city area in Australia are so  expensive\r\n\r\nwhen  compared  to  landed properties in  the  suburbs.   The\r\n\r\ndevelopers  have to spend extra costs on safety  measures  to\r\n\r\nmake  sure  that no accident happens.  And if it  so  happens\r\n\r\nthat  one accident takes place, the whole building works have\r\n\r\nto  be  stopped.  The investigation that follows is  normally\r\n\r\nprolonged  and it takes weeks to complete.  That  would  cost\r\n\r\nthe  developers a lot of money for the stoppage.   Developers\r\n\r\nin  Australia therefore prefer to spend more money on  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures  rather than suffer long stoppages when an  accident\r\n\r\noccurs.   Also, if an accident does happen at the  site,  the\r\n\r\ndeveloper shall get into the bad books of the authorities and\r\n\r\nfuture applications to the authorities may be difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is taking industrial\r\n\r\naccidents at building sites very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseriously  and has put more stringent checks on the  detailed\r\n\r\nstructural  plans and design calculations of building  works.\r\n\r\nWhen  we think of the need to check detailed structural plans\r\n\r\nand  design  calculations of building works, the disaster  at\r\n\r\nCompassvale School quickly comes to mind.  In that  accident,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  cited by the other two speakers, the roof collapsed\r\n\r\nand seven workers were killed and others injured.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that accident may have been prevented if this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill has been passed earlier before the Compassvale\r\n\r\nSchool was built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the three\r\n\r\nspeakers for their support of the Bill, including Mr  Chiam's\r\n\r\nsupport.   However,  I would just like to clarify  one  point\r\n\r\nwith  Mr Chiam and, that is, this Bill has nothing to do with\r\n\r\nconstruction  site accidents.  Construction  site  safety  is\r\n\r\nactually under the Factories Act which is administered  by  a\r\n\r\nseparate Ministry.  Although he supports the Bill, I think in\r\n\r\nhis speech he gave the wrong reasons for supporting the Bill.\r\n\r\nI thought I should clarify this before we continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other two speakers. Mr Lew Syn\r\n\r\nPau  mentioned that the renewal of registration on an  annual\r\n\r\nbasis  may  be too onerous for the QPs and the  ACs.   I  did\r\n\r\nmention in my Second Reading speech that we will review  this\r\n\r\nrenewal  period, and if it is most suitable to have a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod,  we  will  amend  it.  If three  to  five  years  are\r\n\r\nconsidered to be more reasonable, we will certainly amend it.\r\n\r\nHowever,  just let me say that the requirement for having  an\r\n\r\nannual review is to make sure that the qualified persons  are\r\n\r\naware  that they must be at their best professional behaviour\r\n\r\nand  they  are  subject  to  a review.   Therefore,  in  this\r\n\r\nprocess,  hopefully,  they  will be  able  to  exercise  even\r\n\r\ngreater  due diligence in their work.  Having said  that,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, we will ensure that in the review process, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill make it as simple as possible in order to make sure that\r\n\r\nthe  administration  costs involved  are  kept  to  the  very\r\n\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked why contractors are not responsible.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  contractors are not responsible when you are talking\r\n\r\nabout  a building design.  Because in the construction  of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding, the contractor actually works under the supervision\r\n\r\nof  a  qualified  person  (QP).  He  is  responsible  to  the\r\n\r\nqualified  person.   If the qualified person  makes  a  wrong\r\n\r\ndesign  and  the  contractor  carries  out  the  construction\r\n\r\naccording to that wrong design, then it is the QP who  is  at\r\n\r\nfault,  and  not the contractor.  And if the QP's  design  is\r\n\r\ncorrect,  then it is the job of the QP to make sure that  the\r\n\r\ncontractor  carries out his work according to that particular\r\n\r\ndesign and according to proper construction methodology.   So\r\n\r\nin  this particular amendment to the Bill, we are looking  at\r\n\r\nmaking sure that the design in the first place is carried out\r\n\r\nproperly and, secondly, of course, make sure that there is  a\r\n\r\nsecond  level check on that design.  This is in  response  to\r\n\r\nhis point about why the contractor is not responsible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that does not absolve the contractor if the\r\n\r\ncontractor  himself  is  guilty of contravening  any  of  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  safety  regulations or construction  practices.\r\n\r\nFor  example, in the Compassvale incident, if I may  cite  an\r\n\r\nincident,  the contractor was also fined because he  did  not\r\n\r\nperform   certain  works  according  to  that   design.    So\r\n\r\nspecifically, he was fined for not doing work up to a certain\r\n\r\nstandard.   When  we  are talking about  the  design  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding,  which is the subject of this particular amendment,\r\n\r\nit  is  the qualified person, the design engineer as well  as\r\n\r\nthe  AC  who  should be made to exercise full  diligence  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew also asked whether the public sector bids which\r\n\r\nare based on the lowest price would affect the quality of the\r\n\r\ndesign.   If  I  may  explain the process for  public  sector\r\n\r\nworks,  the  public  sector contracts  are  awarded  only  to\r\n\r\ncontractors  which are pre-qualified.  They are  listed  with\r\n\r\nthe Building and Construction\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAuthority (BCA), what is known as the \"G\" List, or Government\r\n\r\nList.   The  Government registration system  is  incidentally\r\n\r\nalso used by the private sector but it is primarily a list of\r\n\r\ncontractors which are registered with the BCA and  from  this\r\n\r\nlist, public sector construction projects are tendered out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractors which fall short of certain requirements,\r\n\r\nwhich  fail to deliver the goods as it were, or which deliver\r\n\r\nshoddy  goods or shoddy workmanship, will be delisted.   They\r\n\r\nwill  no longer be allowed to tender for Government projects.\r\n\r\nSo  it is in the interest of all the contractors to make sure\r\n\r\nthat they deliver a high standard of construction workmanship\r\n\r\nand  that they do not tender frivolously for Government jobs.\r\n\r\nOnly  contractors with good track records are registered  and\r\n\r\nthe  list is updated every few years.  So in the first place,\r\n\r\nwe do have a pre-qualification system which would require the\r\n\r\nG-registered  contractors to qualify to tender.   Contractors\r\n\r\nare also regularly and vigorously screened.  The point I want\r\n\r\nto  make really is that it is not just price alone.  There is\r\n\r\na  pre-qualification process which makes sure that there is a\r\n\r\ncertain minimum standard.  But having said all that, once you\r\n\r\nare on the list, and once you are invited to tender, then  it\r\n\r\nis  only  fair  that the tender price would  be  one  of  the\r\n\r\nfactors, if not the main factor, in deciding whether  tenders\r\n\r\nare  awarded  or  not.  In the interest of  transparency  and\r\n\r\nfairness,  this  must be so.  And there  are  only  very  few\r\n\r\nexceptional  cases  where the tender is not  awarded  to  the\r\n\r\nlowest  tenderer.  So it is not correct to say  that  tenders\r\n\r\nare  based on the lowest price alone.  But it is also correct\r\n\r\nto  say  that  if  they  meet the minimum  standard  of  pre-qualification, then price should be one of the most important\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, can I clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, actually I was\r\n\r\nreferring  to  professional  services,  like  engineers   and\r\n\r\narchitects, not the contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Similarly, for professional engineers\r\n\r\nand  architects,  if they are registered  with  the  relevant\r\n\r\nprofessional boards, then they would be qualified to  tender.\r\n\r\nAnd when it comes to the awards, it is not a matter of price.\r\n\r\nThere  are  certain criteria for awarding these contracts  to\r\n\r\nthese professionals.  Price is one of the factors, but is not\r\n\r\nthe only factor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered Mr Lew's questions. I turn now\r\n\r\nto  the  questions posed by Dr Teo Ho Pin.  Dr Teo makes  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  point that the accredited checking system should  be\r\n\r\nchanged,  that  we should not have a second  level  of  check\r\n\r\nbecause   it   would   then  distract  attention   from   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of the qualified person who,  in  this  case,\r\n\r\nwould be the structural engineer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes the point that professionals should take\r\n\r\nresponsibility for their work and I totally agree with him on\r\n\r\nthis.  But having said that, it would be irresponsible of  us\r\n\r\nnot  to,  in the light of experience, have a second level  of\r\n\r\ncheck.   Singapore is not unique in this.  We are  unique  in\r\n\r\nthe sense that we have an AC system, a second person to check\r\n\r\nthe plans.  But we are not unique in having a second level of\r\n\r\ncheck.  There are many countries which have a second level of\r\n\r\ncheck.   The  only  difference is that this second  level  of\r\n\r\ncheck is done by the building authorities.  So if we were  to\r\n\r\nfollow the system, for example, in Hong Kong and UK and  some\r\n\r\nother  countries, we would have the Building and Construction\r\n\r\nAuthority (BCA) doing the check rather than an AC.  I do  not\r\n\r\nthink,  and  this  is the view of the Review Committee,  that\r\n\r\nhaving  the BCA itself check is in any way superior to having\r\n\r\nthe  accredited checker do the checking.  In the light of the\r\n\r\nHotel  New World disaster and indeed, in a certain way  also,\r\n\r\nbecause of the Compassvale incident, it is important  for  us\r\n\r\nto look at the AC system, to see whether it is still relevant\r\n\r\nand  the  recommendation and finding  is  that  it  is  still\r\n\r\nrelevant.  The  only point is that we need  to  refine  it  a\r\n\r\nlittle  bit  more.  While I do agree with  Dr  Teo  that  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  must  take  primary responsibility  for  their\r\n\r\nwork, I must also add that it is incumbent upon the BCA whose\r\n\r\nmission  is  to  make sure that buildings  in  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nstructurally  sound and properly designed not to  remove  the\r\n\r\nsecond level of check.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked some specific questions about some\r\n\r\nclauses  in the Bill.  He mentioned something about the  word\r\n\r\n\"appropriate\"  in  new  section 10.  Basically,  what  he  is\r\n\r\nasking  is  why  do  we  need to use the word  \"appropriate\".\r\n\r\nEssentially,  when we use the words \"qualified professionals\"\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill, we can either refer to the structural engineer\r\n\r\nor,  in some cases, we can refer to the architect.  The  word\r\n\r\n\"appropriate\"    really   allows   us   to    pinpoint    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of designs, we are looking at the structural\r\n\r\nengineer who is the appropriate qualified person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we prescribe a limit of $10 million? In my\r\n\r\nspeech  I did allude to the fact that, in the case of  larger\r\n\r\njobs, it is deemed necessary for the Accredited Checker to be\r\n\r\nable  to have access to more resources.  It is essentially  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  how  much time you have available  and  how  many\r\n\r\nassistants you have available to help you to do the checking.\r\n\r\nLarger jobs require more checking.  It is as simple as  that.\r\n\r\nAs  to  whether  the limit should be set at $5  million,  $10\r\n\r\nmillion or $20 million, BCA made an assessment of the  number\r\n\r\nof jobs that are available in the marketplace. They feel that\r\n\r\n$10  million is a fair limit as most of the jobs in town  are\r\n\r\nbelow  $10 million.  So, they have set this as the prescribed\r\n\r\nlimit  in  the  first instance.  Again, as I have  indicated,\r\n\r\nwith experience, if we need to change that, we will do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on walls and slabs, I am not sure what exactly\r\n\r\nDr Teo means by this, but I will ask the BCA to look into it.\r\n\r\nAs  I  understand  it,  in  the relevant  section,  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant point is that it is the total value of the building\r\n\r\nworks  that is relevant.  If the total value of the  building\r\n\r\nworks  exceeds  $10  million, then it cannot  be  handled  by\r\n\r\nindividuals.  If it is below, it can be done.  I presume that\r\n\r\nwalls  and  slabs will be included in the total cost  of  the\r\n\r\nbuilding.  I cannot imagine a building being put  up  without\r\n\r\nwalls and slabs!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee\r\n\r\non the Bill. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON PARLIAMENT STAFF</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this Parliament, noting the Report of the\r\n\r\nCommission on Parliament Staff as contained in Paper Misc.  3\r\n\r\nof  2000,  accepts the recommendations of the  Commission  as\r\n\r\ncontained  in paragraph 6 thereof and resolves in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith such recommendations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following the announcement on 29th June 2000 in\r\n\r\nthis House of the revision of salaries in the public service,\r\n\r\na  Commission  consisting of the Speaker,  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister,  the  Minister for Finance,  the  Chairman  of  the\r\n\r\nPublic Service Commission and myself was set up in accordance\r\n\r\nwith Article 51(6) of the Constitution of Singapore to advise\r\n\r\non the application of the revised salaries and the payment of\r\n\r\nPerformance Bonus to the staff of Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission has presented its Report to Parliament on\r\n\r\n19th  August  2000.

Because  of  the  media  serving  purely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  this  impression  gained  acceptance  not   only\r\n\r\namongst  some people in Singapore but also outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut that only gave a picture of a part of the society, not of\r\n\r\nthe whole society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, because it could not be suppressed, there\r\n\r\nwere  peeks at the level of poverty in Singapore.   Sometimes\r\n\r\nit surfaced that there were people who were living at extreme\r\n\r\npoverty  level,  homeless, thrown out of HDB apartments,  but\r\n\r\nthey were soon forgotten, dismissed as isolated cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This claim of being an affluent society, of a society\r\n\r\nwhere  everyone was able to afford not only the  basic  needs\r\n\r\nbut even the better things in life, defied the statistics  on\r\n\r\nwage levels and other statistics that indicated the level  of\r\n\r\nincome  in Singapore.  But, nevertheless, the claim continued\r\n\r\nto  be  made.   We  even had an officer from  the  Statistics\r\n\r\nDepartment appearing before a Select Committee  -  I think it\r\n\r\nwas  in  1995 or 1996  -  claiming that the average household\r\n\r\nincome  in  Singapore was $3,500.  I drew attention  to  this\r\n\r\nwhen  I  spoke  in  this House on 25th  August  1997  on  the\r\n\r\nappointment of a parliamentary committee to review prices.  I\r\n\r\nsaid  then  that  I had found it difficult to understand  the\r\n\r\nstatement  that the average household income was $3,500,  and\r\n\r\nthat  I  had  checked it with the officers of the  Statistics\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  they had admitted to me that  that  was  not\r\n\r\nquite  accurate, that for 50% of our population, the  average\r\n\r\nhousehold  income was well below $2,000.   In  fact,  if  one\r\n\r\nlooks at the figures, for 60%, it is well below $2,000.   And\r\n\r\nyet  there  was  that  claim  made before  the  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncommittee.  The Opposition, and particularly when I had tried\r\n\r\nto bring up this question of poverty in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore,  was  ridiculed and laughed at.  I  remember  that\r\n\r\nwhen  I  was  in the House in the years 1981 to 1984,  I  was\r\n\r\nberated  for  an  interview that I had  given  to  a  foreign\r\n\r\njournalist that in an affluent society, there were still some\r\n\r\npeople who were starving.  But, as I said, I was not speaking\r\n\r\nout  of turn.  And if one really looked at the statistics put\r\n\r\nout  by  the Department of Statistics, one can see the extent\r\n\r\nof poverty that exists in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I illustrate, Mr Speaker, Sir? In 1989 - 10 years\r\n\r\nago   -   there  were still 20,100 workers whose  wages  were\r\n\r\nbelow $200 a month, and there were 74,300 workers whose wages\r\n\r\nwere  well  below  $400 a month, making  a  total  of  94,000\r\n\r\nworkers who were earning below $400 a month.  In 1999,   last\r\n\r\nyear  in  question, there were still 14,700  workers  earning\r\n\r\nbelow $200 per month, and 33,700 earning below $400, making a\r\n\r\ntotal of over 48,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that between 1998 and 1999, the\r\n\r\nfigures   in  these  two  categories  of  wage  earners   had\r\n\r\nincreased.   There  were more people in  1999  earning  below\r\n\r\n$400,  as  against 1998.  So their incomes were  going  down.\r\n\r\nThere were more people earning below $400.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The income gap after 1999 began to widen because the\r\n\r\nsalaries in the top sector were going up, whilst the  workers\r\n\r\nremained  down  at the bottom.  So, we are  in  the  position\r\n\r\ntoday of having a society where Ministers earn over a million\r\n\r\ndollars  a  year.   I  see  in  the  last  sitting  of   this\r\n\r\nParliament, the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement  about\r\n\r\nthe revisions.  I was not here then.  The salary of the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister was given, after the revision, as nearly $2  million\r\n\r\nannually.   No figures were given for the salaries that  were\r\n\r\nto  be  paid  to  the Senior Minister and  the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinisters  after the revision was made.  The other  Ministers\r\n\r\nwould be paid, after the revision over $1 million annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not politics of envy, Mr Speaker, Sir. No doubt,\r\n\r\nit  will  be  labelled as one.  But, seriously,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nconsider and ask\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nourselves a question: how is it that in a society the  lowest\r\n\r\nemployee gets below $200 a month and the Ministers earn  over\r\n\r\n$1  million a year?  That is nearly $100,000 a month.  Are we\r\n\r\nto  be  proud of that fact?  What does that say for ourselves\r\n\r\nas  a  society?  Does it say that we are concerned  with  the\r\n\r\nunder-privileged, the people who do not have enough?  Or does\r\n\r\nit  say  that we are a society that shows a callous disregard\r\n\r\nfor  those down below and allows those who are able to go  on\r\n\r\nearning  more  and  more and more without  any  ceiling?   We\r\n\r\nshould  ask ourselves that question.  What does it say  about\r\n\r\nAsian  values of which this Government makes a  lot.   Is  it\r\n\r\nAsian  values  that  a  society  with  this  yawning  gap  is\r\n\r\nacceptable?   I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is an  affront.\r\n\r\nBut  if it is argued that it is not contrary to Asian values,\r\n\r\nthen  let me say I do not think very much of Asian values  if\r\n\r\nthe Asian values can tolerate this great disparity in income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the present poverty line in Singapore? I would\r\n\r\ncommend  to  the Government that one of the immediate  things\r\n\r\nthey  should  do  is to set up a Commission to  inquire  into\r\n\r\npoverty in Singapore, to admit truly and honestly that we  do\r\n\r\nhave  poverty  in  this society and that  the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared to take it seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I inquired from persons.  The first person  I\r\n\r\ninquired  was a single person living on his own.  His  answer\r\n\r\nwas  that he needed about $1,000 a month to live in Singapore\r\n\r\nto  pay for the rent, for all the other things that went with\r\n\r\na  basic  standard  of  living, not  a  living  that  affords\r\n\r\nchocolates, perfumes and luxury items, but basic needs.  Then\r\n\r\nI spoke to another man and he said he had only one child.  He\r\n\r\nsaid  he needed at least $1,200 to $1,300 a month to maintain\r\n\r\nthe  wife and the child.  Finally, I spoke to someone who had\r\n\r\ntwo  children.  His answer was, \"Easily over $1,500.  I  need\r\n\r\nat  least $1,600 or $1,700 a month.\"  Have we made any  study\r\n\r\nof  the requirements in Singapore for a family of four, three\r\n\r\nor even just one?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was asking for a Commission to inquire into poverty in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I would suggest that we seek the help of somebody\r\n\r\nfrom  the  United Nations Commission to come and help  us  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  scientific study.  They who know about  poverty  can\r\n\r\nthen  make  a  proper  study and show the comparison  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and other countries.  But we have got this  income\r\n\r\ndisparity  report.   I  was not surprised  when  I  saw  that\r\n\r\nreport, as we said in the press report that I made on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  the party.  We knew all along that the people down  below\r\n\r\nwere suffering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this report now disclose? That for 30% of our\r\n\r\nmembers in the society, the average household income is  just\r\n\r\nover  $1,000  a  month.   30% is not to  be  laughed  at,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir.  How do you expect them to survive?  When I say\r\n\r\n\"survive\",  I mean a decent standard of living  on  $1,000  a\r\n\r\nmonth,  when you consider that Singapore is one of  the  most\r\n\r\nexpensive places to live in.   This is even told to me, as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said time and time again, not by people from India  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia,  but by people from the developed countries.   They\r\n\r\nsay  Singapore is very expensive.  If you set that  level  of\r\n\r\nincome  for  the  30%  against  those  in  the  top  earners,\r\n\r\nMinisters  and  top civil servants, judges, I  say  it  is  a\r\n\r\nnational disgrace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last sitting, again when I was not here, I see\r\n\r\nthe Minister tried to minimise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  report.   Of  course,  we  had  seen  that  earlier   by\r\n\r\nGovernment officials trying to minimise the severity  of  the\r\n\r\nreport.  He is reported to have said that the poor are not as\r\n\r\nbadly  off  as  made  out to be.  I find  that  difficult  to\r\n\r\nunderstand.   How  badly  must  they  be  before   they   are\r\n\r\nrecognised  as  being badly off?  Should  they  be  starving,\r\n\r\ndying on the streets before the Government recognises that we\r\n\r\nhave  a  section of our people who are badly off?   This,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  in  a country which is by  no  means  a  poor\r\n\r\ncountry.   We  boast, and again we make much of it,  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  built up foreign reserves to $128,457,000.  So  we  are\r\n\r\nnot a poor, struggling country that finds it difficult to see\r\n\r\nthat  its people can afford a basic decent standard of  life.\r\n\r\nAll  they need, as I have kept saying again and again,  is  a\r\n\r\npolitical  will to do something about the condition  of  this\r\n\r\n30% of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I met the Prime Minister at the National Day\r\n\r\nreception of the President, and I told him I had this motion,\r\n\r\nhe  said,  \"We  have got our programme ready.   We  have  got\r\n\r\neverything ready.\"  I said, \"Great.\"  I hope I shall be  told\r\n\r\nwhat is it that the Government has got.  What measures has it\r\n\r\ndecided  upon  to  check and correct this  imbalance  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety?   Then I saw at the National Day Rally the programme\r\n\r\nof  the  Government was to hand out lollipops.   It  is  like\r\n\r\nhanding out lollipops to children who are being querulous  to\r\n\r\nkeep them quiet.  May I tell the Government that handing  out\r\n\r\nlollipops  is not the answer.   Something more than  that  is\r\n\r\nneeded,  something  which will improve  the  lives  of  these\r\n\r\npeople over the long term.  Of course, the local media,  true\r\n\r\nto  its  role,  highlights  $3.2 billion,  how  generous  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is.  We forget that that is our money.   All  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is required to do is to see that it is put  to\r\n\r\nproper  use, a judicial use that benefits all members of  the\r\n\r\nsociety,  not any particular section of the society.   So  we\r\n\r\nneed to do something immediately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I intend to list, first of all, what measures that I say\r\n\r\nhave  to be put in place and then come back and talk on  each\r\n\r\nof  these  measures a little.  The first one which  is  quite\r\n\r\nclearly crying out is that we should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nput our workers in a position of equality with employers.   I\r\n\r\nshall  expand  on this.  But today the workers have  no  more\r\n\r\nrights than the serfs had in the middle ages under the common\r\n\r\nlaw, and I shall read an excerpt from the Second Reading of a\r\n\r\nBill  in 1968, as exactly what was done.  We need to put  the\r\n\r\nworkers  on  an  equality with employers.  You  have  got  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  that labour has a definite contribution  to  make.\r\n\r\nLabour  is  not  subservient  to  capital.   Labour  is   not\r\n\r\nsubservient  to  land.  It is these three factors  which  are\r\n\r\nnecessary for production.  So they must be given equal rights\r\n\r\nwith  capital.  For that, I shall list out why we need a  new\r\n\r\nEmployment Act.  Secondly, we need a new Industrial Relations\r\n\r\nAct.   Thirdly, we need a new Act, the Unfair Dismissals Act,\r\n\r\nto protect the workers from exploitation by the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I am listing this out before I speak on each\r\n\r\none  of  them.  We have got to democratise our trade  unions.\r\n\r\nGive  them  the  power that trade unions in  other  countries\r\n\r\nhave.   We need to see that they are run on democratic lines.\r\n\r\nLet  us  remove the anachronism of a Cabinet Minister leading\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union  movement.   How  is  that  possible?   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  be the biggest employer  along  with  the\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards.   And  we have its Ministers  leading  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions,  the  workers.  It is  laughable.   The  fifth\r\n\r\nproposal  is  to  have a new Wages Council, where  again  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  and  the  labour have equal  rights.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, they are outnumbered by the employer, 2 to 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixthly, we have got to have a new Trade Disputes Act.\r\n\r\nI  am aware that there should be some limit on strikes.   But\r\n\r\nwe  should not take it out completely from the trade  unions.\r\n\r\nStrikes still remain the most powerful weapon in the hands of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  But as I said, I concede that there should  be\r\n\r\nsome limit.  But at the moment, it is completely taken out of\r\n\r\ntheir  hands.   I see that the then Minister for  Labour,  Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam, referred to the strikes in the 1960s  as  one  of\r\n\r\nthe  things that we could not afford in our society.   But  I\r\n\r\nask the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquestion: who were responsible for the labour disorder, if it\r\n\r\nwas labour disorder, in the 50s and 60s?  Sir, I was here,  I\r\n\r\nhave  said this before.  Our present Senior Minister was  the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser to a number of trade unions.  He was advocating\r\n\r\nthe rights of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventhly, we got to give workers proper representation\r\n\r\nbefore inquiry tribunals, before they are dismissed by  their\r\n\r\ncompanies.  At the moment, it is all a farce.   So all  these\r\n\r\nmeasures are necessary to give our workers their rights which\r\n\r\nthey deserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eighth proposal is that Government now considers\r\n\r\nseriously  revising  the  CPF contribution  rates.   We  have\r\n\r\nadvocated  that  the employees should only pay  15%  and  the\r\n\r\nemployers pay the same amount.  I call upon the Government to\r\n\r\nbring  up the employer's contribution to 15% immediately  and\r\n\r\nto  reduce the employee's contribution to the same level,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  have a bit more money to take home and to  spend.\r\n\r\nThen,  I have a number of measures.  These are all structural\r\n\r\nchanges we have to make.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if I may touch on the measures to meet the needs of\r\n\r\npeople  who  cannot  afford them.  I  think  it  is  time  we\r\n\r\nseriously considered social security for those in need.   The\r\n\r\nproblem in other countries was that they give social welfare,\r\n\r\nmedical  relief to everyone, with the result that  there  was\r\n\r\nabuse  of the system.  But surely we can do something to  see\r\n\r\nthat  only  the  needy  get  the  benefit  under  the  social\r\n\r\nsecurity.   Could  we not provide social  security  and  give\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  those earning below $2,000  per  month?   They\r\n\r\ncarry a welfare card to be entitled to all the benefits.  And\r\n\r\nI am proposing that under that scheme, it should provide free\r\n\r\nmedical  care to those who qualify.  Medisave does not  cover\r\n\r\noutpatient charges. That is where most of the money goes.   I\r\n\r\nhear  complaints from people about how much they have to  pay\r\n\r\nevery time they go to a polyclinic for outpatient treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, there should be payment of a children's allowance,\r\n\r\nnot just designed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincrease the population.  But a children's allowance - I have\r\n\r\nbeen calling for this many, many years - for those who are in\r\n\r\nneed  of this allowance, to see that they can bring up  their\r\n\r\nchildren, and educate them sufficiently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, again, under the social security, I think the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  seriously  consider  introducing  old-age\r\n\r\npensions  for those over 65, regardless of whether  they  are\r\n\r\nCPF  contributors  or whether they have savings  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\nfund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing I am proposing is that the Government now\r\n\r\nprovides  free  education to all our students  whose  parents\r\n\r\nearn below $2,000 a month.  A claim has been made, and it  is\r\n\r\nstill  made, and I see that it is in today's paper,  that  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  education is free.  This  is  one  of  the  false\r\n\r\nclaims that is constantly made about things in Singapore.   I\r\n\r\ncheck  it  up, and I have checked it before as well.   But  I\r\n\r\nchecked  it  up  recently, rang a family up.  They  have  two\r\n\r\nchildren in a primary school.  Do they have to pay any school\r\n\r\nfees?   They  say  that they have to pay $15  every  quarter.\r\n\r\nWhat  is in a name?  It does not matter.  You do not call  it\r\n\r\nschool  fees, you call it under some other name, and  collect\r\n\r\nthe money.  But the money still has to come from the parents.\r\n\r\nAt  secondary level, they say they have to pay $51 a quarter,\r\n\r\nthat is, $17 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us stop this sham of saying free education for\r\n\r\nall,  and  see that families earning below $2,000  get  their\r\n\r\nchildren educated free in Singapore.  We can afford, if  only\r\n\r\nwe did not spend so much of our money on unnecessary things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, under the social security, we should consider\r\n\r\nunemployment  benefits for those unemployed, perhaps  limited\r\n\r\nfor  a number of months.  If they are genuinely unable to get\r\n\r\nemployment,  they should be helped and not told, \"Hard  luck,\r\n\r\npoor chap!  Just carry on, try and get another job.  Try  and\r\n\r\nimprove  your  skills.  We are all right, but you  know,  you\r\n\r\njust  carry  on.   Soon enough you will  get  a  job.\"   This\r\n\r\nquestion of improving skills - how much more are you going to\r\n\r\nbe able to teach or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprove  the skills of cleaners and road sweepers?   So  what\r\n\r\nare  we  talking  about when we say that  they  have  got  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the skills and learn more?  How much more  can  they\r\n\r\nlearn?  Can we have an answer to that question?  So what  are\r\n\r\nwe going to do?  Are we going to leave them just earning $400\r\n\r\na  month,  and  not give them any benefits, and  say  go  and\r\n\r\nimprove yourself?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say something about what I have listed first, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  a new Employment Act that we need.  We need  a  new\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act for the 21st century that will recognise  the\r\n\r\nrightful  place of labour in society.  I see that a call  was\r\n\r\nmade  by  the NTUC.  It was reported in the Straits Times  of\r\n\r\n23rd  August  2000 that labour needed a new social  contract.\r\n\r\nWell,  that  is  it.  But let us not just talk  about  a  new\r\n\r\nsocial  contract.   Let us give them a  new  Employment  Act.\r\n\r\nThis  present  Employment Act was passed on 10th  July  1968.\r\n\r\nBefore  that,  there was the Employment Ordinance  from  1955\r\n\r\nwhich, let me tell Members, gave our workers more rights  and\r\n\r\nbenefits.   But  these  were  all  curtailed  under  the  new\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill,  because the British had pulled  out  their\r\n\r\nforces  and we needed to improve ourselves, and so we  needed\r\n\r\nto   attract   foreign  capital,  we  needed   multi-national\r\n\r\ncompanies to come in, and therefore the workers had  to  lose\r\n\r\ntheir rights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rajaratnam, moving the Second Reading of this Bill,\r\n\r\nacknowledged  that  there  were quite  a  bit  of  criticisms\r\n\r\noutside Parliament of the Bill.  But he dismissed that and he\r\n\r\nsaid, and I am going to read what he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But the people will respond provided they are convinced\r\n\r\nthat the effort and difficult adjustments demanded are really\r\n\r\ndirected towards eventually promoting the well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople as a whole and not merely to enrich a privileged few - whether   gay  and  fun-loving  political  leaders   or   the\r\n\r\nracketeering ruffians with whom they are allied.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not my words. These are the words of Mr\r\n\r\nRajaratnam  who was then Minister for Labour.  He  said  that\r\n\r\nthe  justification  was that in the end, the  measures  would\r\n\r\npromote  the welfare of the people.  Well, has the Employment\r\n\r\nAct promoted\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe well-being of the people as a whole?  Has it achieved the\r\n\r\nobjects  that Mr Rajaratnam was propounding?  Or has it  left\r\n\r\nthe  workers worse off? Let us ask these questions seriously.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned particularly about the criticism on clause 10 of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  which  curtailed the right of the  worker  on  the\r\n\r\nperiod  of notice that he had to be given before his services\r\n\r\nwere  terminated.  Under the old Act, the worker had a longer\r\n\r\nperiod of notice before his services could be terminated.   I\r\n\r\nwould  not  spell  them out for want of  time.   But  he  had\r\n\r\nconsiderably more notice.  And those who worked for more than\r\n\r\nfive  years  had two months' notice.  The new Act  passed  in\r\n\r\n1968 by a government which had professed itself to be worker-conscious  radically cut this down.  It did  not  matter  how\r\n\r\nmany  years  the employee had worked, the maximum  period  of\r\n\r\nnotice  required was reduced to four weeks.  And if you  have\r\n\r\nworked for less than six months, you do not get any notice at\r\n\r\nall,  you  can  be just fired immediately.   So  we  need  to\r\n\r\nappoint a committee to re-examine the Employment Act  and  to\r\n\r\nsee  whether  we  still  need to continue  with  a  law  that\r\n\r\npractically makes our workers helpless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the employer holds the whip. It is no good\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"Oh,  there are benefits provided, and the  employer\r\n\r\nhas  to provide that.\"  But as long as he can hire and  fire,\r\n\r\nthese benefits are valueless.  I have heard people come to me\r\n\r\nand  say,  \"I  have  been given notice.\"   Why?   \"Because  I\r\n\r\nquestioned my superior.  I told him that I do not think  that\r\n\r\nwas   right   on  something.   So  they  said  I   am   being\r\n\r\ninsubordinate.\"   So there you are.  And  he  has  no  remedy\r\n\r\nbecause under the Act, there is nothing he can do.  There  is\r\n\r\nsection  14  which, on the face of it, gives him a  right  of\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Minister.  But I have mentioned several  times\r\n\r\nthat that is really valueless.  We have got to have an Unfair\r\n\r\nDismissals Act under which the court can compel the  employer\r\n\r\nto take the worker back into employment and, failing that, to\r\n\r\npay  adequate compensation for his losses and damage that  he\r\n\r\nwould  suffer.  This is the position in developed  countries.\r\n\r\nThis is the position\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin countries where they recognise the value of labour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said about trade unions. In the same month that the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill was presented to Parliament  in  July  1968,\r\n\r\nthere  was  presented  the Industrial  Relations  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.   This really sounded the death knell for trade  unions\r\n\r\nand see what the Minister said when he presented this Bill to\r\n\r\nParliament:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The trade unions have never questioned the rights of\r\n\r\nmanagement to manage, first, as a matter of commonsense, and,\r\n\r\nsecond,  it  is because these rights are common  law  rights.\r\n\r\nBut  whatever the theory, the rights of management have  over\r\n\r\nthe  years been eroded, perhaps not as a conscious policy  by\r\n\r\ntrade unions.  What this Bill seeks to do is to restore these\r\n\r\nrights  of  management to the employers by making common  law\r\n\r\nrights into statute law.  No rights are being taken away from\r\n\r\nthe  workers  because the workers never claimed these  rights\r\n\r\neven though some of these rights have in practice been denied\r\n\r\nto   management.   We  are  not  restoring  these  rights  to\r\n\r\nmanagement  merely out of a sense of justice and  fair  play.\r\n\r\nBut  because  we are convinced that unless proper  management\r\n\r\nfunctions are allowed to be performed unhampered there  would\r\n\r\nbe little or no economic expansion or fresh investments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.06 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have it, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I said.\r\n\r\nThis  Government  was  putting workers  back  into  what  the\r\n\r\nworkers  were in the Middle Ages.  Because under  the  common\r\n\r\nlaw,  with  its  emphasis  on the  power  to  make  your  own\r\n\r\ncontract,  the workers were unable to secure any  rights  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.   But progressive countries saw the need  to  cut\r\n\r\ndown on these common law rights of the employers and to bring\r\n\r\nin  statutory provisions to protect the workers.  But here is\r\n\r\nthis  Government  saying, \"Oh, the workers  never  had  those\r\n\r\nrights.\"  Of course, they did not.  And so it says,  \"We  are\r\n\r\nnow  going  to  restore our workers to  that  position.   The\r\n\r\nformer  labour  government was misguided in giving  them  the\r\n\r\nrights.   We  are now going to take it away.\"  That  is  what\r\n\r\nthis Government did in 1968.  Because what it did in this Act\r\n\r\nwas  to  make  the trade unions toothless.   Section  16,  or\r\n\r\nsection  17,  which gave the trade unions the power  to  give\r\n\r\nnotice to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployers  of a new agreement for the workers was drastically\r\n\r\naltered.   Under the old Act, the trade unions had the  right\r\n\r\nto  make  proposals about whose services should be terminated\r\n\r\nand  what  should  be done before they were  terminated,  the\r\n\r\nconditions  and a host of other things.  I have not  got  the\r\n\r\ntime to read all that.  But this was taken away completely by\r\n\r\nthe  Employment Act, \"No trade union can submit any  proposal\r\n\r\nto the employer on all these rights.\"  So where does it leave\r\n\r\nthe trade unions?  Practically powerless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone from Hong Kong saw me the other day and he said,\r\n\r\n\"I   see   now  the  trade  unions  are  very  busy   running\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\"  I said, \"Yes, exactly, because they  cannot  do\r\n\r\nthe  work  that  they  should  be  doing.  So  they  go  into\r\n\r\nbusiness.\"   But he said, \"Is that the work of trade unions?\"\r\n\r\nI  said, certainly not.  So we need to look at this.   Is  it\r\n\r\nstill  necessary to keep our trade unions in this subservient\r\n\r\nposition  that  they  have to go on  bended  knees  to  their\r\n\r\ncapitalist  employers?   Or  should  they  not  negotiate  as\r\n\r\nequals?  And for that, we need a new Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nand  then  we need a new Unfair Dismissals Act.  That  is  so\r\n\r\nclear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, as I have said, an employer can just\r\n\r\nterminate  the services of an employee just because  perhaps,\r\n\r\nas  one Member said some time ago if the worker whistled  and\r\n\r\nthe  employer did not like the tune or something he had  only\r\n\r\nto  say, \"You can leave.\"  We need to protect him and to  see\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  adequately compensated,  if  his  services  are\r\n\r\nterminated without proper cause.  Section 14 is no protection\r\n\r\nat  all for an employee who is unfairly terminated.   We have\r\n\r\ngot to protect him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fourth on my list is allowing trade unions to be\r\n\r\nrun  on democratic lines.  Let them select their own leaders.\r\n\r\nIt should not be left to the Government to appoint leaders in\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement.  Remove the post of  the  Cabinet\r\n\r\nMinister  as Secretary-General of the NTUC.  He is  paid  for\r\n\r\ndoing just that, to keep the workers policed on behalf of the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Then, as I said, we have got\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  change the composition of the Wages Council.  We have got\r\n\r\nto  see that the trade unions get equal representation.  They\r\n\r\nshould  have  a definite say on how much a worker  should  be\r\n\r\npaid.   At the moment, they are outnumbered.  Let us consider\r\n\r\nappointing a new Wages Council, not just the workers, but for\r\n\r\neverybody,  as  I  said.  Let us have a National  Council  on\r\n\r\nSalaries for Ministers, Judges and top civil servants so that\r\n\r\neveryone  is  put  on  an equal footing and  given  the  same\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the sixth proposal that I said about amending the\r\n\r\nTrade  Disputes Act, again, I do not have to  say  very  much\r\n\r\nmore.  We have got to give the trade unions the right to call\r\n\r\noff  the workers, if the employers get very unreasonable  and\r\n\r\nadamant  about enforcing their own position on the employees.\r\n\r\nLet  us  give  the worker the dignity he needs.   I  see  the\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister, some days ago, was saying  that  the\r\n\r\nworker  is  worthy  of  respect and he should  be  given  the\r\n\r\nrespect he deserves.  Let us stop all this rhetoric.  You can\r\n\r\nonly  give the worker the respect and the dignity if you give\r\n\r\nhim  the  rights.   A person without any  rights  is  in  the\r\n\r\nposition  of  a beggar and how can you tell the beggar,  \"You\r\n\r\nhave  dignity, my man! Stand up, you have dignity!\", when  he\r\n\r\nis  forced to go down on his knees, as the workers are  doing\r\n\r\nat the moment, when negotiating with the employers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same lines is this representation before\r\n\r\ninquiry tribunals.  The reason for excluding lawyers was that\r\n\r\nlawyers  would make trouble.  They would be too costly.   But\r\n\r\nat  least,  the lawyers will be there to protect the  worker.\r\n\r\nWhy   do  we  not  force  the  companies  to  pay  for  legal\r\n\r\nrepresentation and have a proper inquiry before they  dismiss\r\n\r\na  worker?  Surely if a company is interested in the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  its  workers, it will agree to pay for the legal services\r\n\r\nof  any employee who is charged with anything so that  he  is\r\n\r\nproperly represented and protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Jeyaretnam, your one hour\r\n\r\nis up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I will take up the rest in my reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the problem of\r\n\r\nincome gap has been in existence all along. The magnitude  of\r\n\r\nthe gap also reflects the seriousness of inequalities between\r\n\r\nthe  rich  and  the poor in our society. The  recent  figures\r\n\r\nreleased  by  the  Statistics Department showed  signs  of  a\r\n\r\nfurther widening income gap between the rich and the poor.  I\r\n\r\nhope  this will not become a trend, otherwise it will be very\r\n\r\nserious and will cause a divide in our social communities and\r\n\r\nethnic groups, thereby weakening our social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the types of occupation of members of the families\r\n\r\nin  the  bottom  10%, as revealed in the survey  report,   it\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that  the cause of the  problem  lies  in  the\r\n\r\nwidening  gap of salaries for different jobs. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\ntop  priority of the Government is how to upgrade the workers\r\n\r\nin the low-income jobs.  At the same time, it should help the\r\n\r\nsmall and medium enterprises to develop and to make them more\r\n\r\ncompetitive and more effective, so that they could  have  the\r\n\r\nmeans to pay higher wages to their employees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have, on many occasions in this House, urged the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  show more concern for those workers  who  are\r\n\r\naged  40 years and above with low educational foundation  and\r\n\r\nhave  hardly any skills.  They are the people who are  facing\r\n\r\nvery  acute challenges ahead, particularly when Singapore  is\r\n\r\nmoving  towards a knowledge-based economy and  an  influx  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers. The Government's answer is inevitably  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Manpower has all sorts of technical training\r\n\r\ncourses   awaiting  these  workers  to  enrol   and   upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this attitude of the Government is very\r\n\r\nnegative.  Although  the Government has  made  available  the\r\n\r\nvarious  courses,  it  does  not necessarily  mean  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  would  participate in them.  Many of  these  workers\r\n\r\nhave to do two jobs or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\novertime  work to earn enough to support their  families.  By\r\n\r\nthe  time  they finish work, they would be exhausted.   Where\r\n\r\nwould  they have the energy left to pursue upgrading courses?\r\n\r\nEven  if they want to change jobs, they do not know what type\r\n\r\nof  jobs to change to, and they worry that when they start  a\r\n\r\nnew  job, the initial salaries would be very low as they lack\r\n\r\nthe  experience. As such, the starting pay  may not be enough\r\n\r\nto support their family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, many of these workers do not know\r\n\r\nEnglish  and  many courses and examinations are conducted  in\r\n\r\nEnglish.  There  is  no  way  they  could  participate.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should be more proactive in helping  these  lower\r\n\r\nincome  workers.  When these workers are prepared  to  accept\r\n\r\nskill upgrading training, the Government should pay them cost\r\n\r\nof  living  allowances during the period of training,  as  an\r\n\r\nincentive for them to upgrade themselves and move to  better-paying jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the recent labour market report, those\r\n\r\nworkers above the age of 40 years with below secondary  level\r\n\r\neducation are more likely to be retrenched.  As such, if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does not look into these problems  seriously,  we\r\n\r\ncan  well  expect the income gap in Singapore to  continually\r\n\r\nwiden.   The  Government should not be so naive as  to  think\r\n\r\nthat  so long as the economy recovers, and the labour  market\r\n\r\ntightens,  the  employment problem of these workers  will  be\r\n\r\nnaturally resolved, and their income would be raised.  Please\r\n\r\ndo  not  forget that by that time, the income gap  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious   job   sectors  will  be  correspondingly   widened,\r\n\r\nresulting  in greater inequalities between the poor  and  the\r\n\r\nrich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government embraces the principle of market\r\n\r\neconomy, and the rate of  charges for public service is based\r\n\r\non  affordability.  To the lower-income group, this  type  of\r\n\r\npolicy is a merciless blow.  If the Government does not  take\r\n\r\nprompt  steps to effectively check the widening  income  gap,\r\n\r\nthen the standard of living for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  lower-income  families will simply  continue  to  slide.\r\n\r\nThis  will  be  a  great  mockery to the  Government's  self-proclamation that Singapore is an affluent society  and  that\r\n\r\nsome  of  our service industries are number one in the  world\r\n\r\nand have reached world standards!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to comment on the NCMP's observation that  there\r\n\r\nare 14,700 Singaporeans earning less than $200 per month.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> 48,000 less than $400.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> As far as I know, there is no full-time job in Singapore that pays that kind of wages, but this\r\n\r\nmay  be  so for part-time jobs.

From the discussions in the House,  it\r\n\r\nwas  obvious that the issue of the widening income gap is not\r\n\r\nunique  to Singapore.  In fact, it is an issue which is  part\r\n\r\nand  parcel of the new economy. From the discussions, it also\r\n\r\nshows  that  the Singapore Government is not sitting  on  its\r\n\r\nlaurels  for the problem to become a chronic issue. The  NCMP\r\n\r\nshould  judge the Government on the proactive actions it  has\r\n\r\ntaken to address the issues.

A country could decide to isolate itself  from  the\r\n\r\nproblem  by  not  globalising and not  participating  in  the\r\n\r\nphenomenal  growth of the new economy.  But  obviously,  this\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  be  a rational decision because the world will not  wait\r\n\r\nfor  those  who  are  not  able  to  change  and  accept  and\r\n\r\nparticipate  with the new rules of economic development.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have no choice but to participate in this new economy  if\r\n\r\nwe  want  to survive as a country in the years ahead.  If  we\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  Gini  coefficient in all  countries  that  are\r\n\r\nalready  at an advanced stage of globalisation, all  of  them\r\n\r\nare recording a widening of income disparities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Deputy Prime Minister put it in his speech\r\n\r\nduring  the debate on the Ministerial salaries, globalisation\r\n\r\nhas created a single world market for talent.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nthis  is  precisely  the root cause of the  issue  of  income\r\n\r\ndisparities.  The new economy will see wealth creation  being\r\n\r\naccelerated by those who dare to take the risk and to venture\r\n\r\ninto new areas of technology and business. Wealth creation in\r\n\r\nthis new economy will be quite different from wealth creation\r\n\r\nthat  happened in the age of industralisation or in  the  old\r\n\r\neconomy in general.  While the enterprises in the old economy\r\n\r\ncreated  wealth  through bricks and mortar and  also  through\r\n\r\nbricks  and mortar businesses and this typically took a  long\r\n\r\ntime to be created, in the new economy, entrepreneurs will be\r\n\r\nable to create wealth at a much faster pace than any time  in\r\n\r\nhistory and the quantum of the wealth created will be so huge\r\n\r\nand  unimaginable in the old economy.  People like Bill Gates\r\n\r\ncreated so much of wealth in such a short time that they will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to spend all their money in their lifetime,  nor\r\n\r\nin  several generations to come for his family.  Sir, Richard\r\n\r\nLi  from  Hong Kong created his few billion dollars worth  of\r\n\r\nwealth  in just three years, matching what his father created\r\n\r\nin  30  years of his lifetime. Such is the nature of the  new\r\n\r\neconomy  and such are examples of things to come in the  next\r\n\r\nphase  of  economic development in the world and by  default,\r\n\r\nsuch  will be the nature of things to come for Singapore from\r\n\r\nnow onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, more Singaporeans will be more daring and\r\n\r\nwilling to try and hence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  have  a  chance to strike the gold at the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nrainbow.  We  are  already seeing many  Singaporeans  seeking\r\n\r\nopportunities   in   the   knowledge   economy,   giving   up\r\n\r\nalternative, stable employment in traditional industries  and\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  The  question  is:   should  we  discourage   or\r\n\r\nencourage such people?  Should we create an environment  that\r\n\r\nretards  or  inhibits  such  people  or  should  we  have  an\r\n\r\nenvironment that further encourages more people to try?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure Singapore's continued growth and\r\n\r\nprosperity  in the future, we have no choice but  to  embrace\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and to participate in the new economy  and  to\r\n\r\nallow  practices consistent with the development of the  high\r\n\r\ngrowth knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new economy where opportunities will be\r\n\r\nmore  equal  than  in  the  past,  everyone  will  have   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to create wealth, but not everyone will  want  to\r\n\r\nor  will  be  able  to  participate  as  effectively  in  the\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  However, in such an economy,  those\r\n\r\nwith  skills  and the relevant capabilities  will  command  a\r\n\r\nhigher premium and therefore higher wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, entrepreneurs and technopreneurs will help\r\n\r\ncreate wealth for the country and hence create more jobs  for\r\n\r\nothers  in  Singapore.  If  we  do  not  encourage  such   an\r\n\r\nenvironment    that    encourages    technopreneurship     or\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship,  we  will  lose  our  talented  people   to\r\n\r\ncountries  like  the  USA  where they  will  be  given  ample\r\n\r\nopportunities to excel. The competition for talent is  global\r\n\r\nin  nature, as I mentioned.  Since our people will have  more\r\n\r\nchoices  and will be a lot more mobile than in the  past  and\r\n\r\nsince  we  have other countries equally hungry for  the  best\r\n\r\ntalents  from  around the world, if we  do  not  satisfy  the\r\n\r\ndemands of such Singaporeans whose skills are valued in other\r\n\r\ncountries, they will pack up and leave.  Similarly,  even  in\r\n\r\nbig  companies,  or  for that matter in the  Government,  the\r\n\r\ncapable and talented people will have to be well rewarded  if\r\n\r\nwe want to keep them.  Paying them high\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsalaries  is  well worth the expenditure if they  can  create\r\n\r\ncompetitive advantages for the organisations that  they  work\r\n\r\nfor.   We  should  therefore compare the  worth  of  our  top\r\n\r\ntalents  against  the global workforce  in  a  global  market\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at things from a global perspective, then\r\n\r\nwe  have  no choice but to accept the fact that the wages  of\r\n\r\nour top earners will have to be determined on a global basis,\r\n\r\nand  we have no choice but to allow each to achieve his  full\r\n\r\npotential  of  earning  capability.  We  cannot  artificially\r\n\r\nsuppress anyone in order to address the issue of income gaps.\r\n\r\nSo, the obvious thing to do is to let things go and allow our\r\n\r\ntop  talents  to  earn  however much  they  can.   When  this\r\n\r\nhappens,  the sure thing to happen is that those at  the  top\r\n\r\nend  will  be extraordinarily rich, and this will worsen  the\r\n\r\nissue  of the income gap compared to the lower income earners\r\n\r\nin  the  country.   In every society, there  will  always  be\r\n\r\npeople at both ends of the spectrum.  This is the reality  of\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we also cannot artificially prop up\r\n\r\nthe  wages  of the low income earners in order to  close  the\r\n\r\ngap.  Because, just as the competition for talent at the  top\r\n\r\nis  a global one, similarly, the competition for jobs at  the\r\n\r\nlower end is also global in nature.  So our unskilled workers\r\n\r\nwho form the lower income earners in the country will have to\r\n\r\ncompete  with  workers  from  countries  like  India,  China,\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  Bangladesh and other countries around the  world.\r\n\r\nPrice  of  our labour must be competitive compared to  labour\r\n\r\nfrom  these  countries.  We cannot artificially prop  up  the\r\n\r\nwages of such people through practices like the minimum  wage\r\n\r\nsystem,  because  we  will risk over pricing  ourselves  and,\r\n\r\nhence,  cause an acceleration of companies relocating out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore to countries that offer cheaper infrastructure  and\r\n\r\nlabour cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be realistic, we therefore have to accept the fact\r\n\r\nthat  more  wealth will be created by just a few people.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, every society will always have its share  of\r\n\r\npeople who cannot successfully\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncatch up with progress and who will lack the necessary skills\r\n\r\nto  do well.  Therefore, income disparities will continue  to\r\n\r\nbe worsened as we progress in this new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we will have very high income earners who will be\r\n\r\nable  to  enjoy very comfortable lives and who can choose  to\r\n\r\nlive  in  any country they choose to live in, our low  income\r\n\r\nearners should not be deprived of the necessities of life and\r\n\r\nthey should also have a share in some of the luxuries of life\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   In  other words, we  must  ensure  that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have a reasonably good quality of life no matter\r\n\r\nwhat  their  background.  This must be the  Government's  key\r\n\r\nresponsibility  so that we will continue to  enjoy  the  good\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion that Singapore has enjoyed in  the  last  30\r\n\r\nyears or so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real question then is: how should the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore prepare to tackle this issue so that\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans, no matter what their background or  income\r\n\r\nlevels  are, will have a good life in Singapore  and  no  one\r\n\r\nshould  feel deprived or live in envy of others who  enjoy  a\r\n\r\nhigher income level?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the best bet for us is not to try to\r\n\r\nbalance income levels, but to have a level playing field  for\r\n\r\nopportunities, so that no matter what walk of life one  comes\r\n\r\nfrom,  he  or she will have an equal opportunity to  earn  as\r\n\r\nhigh  an income as possible and have a chance to make a  jump\r\n\r\nfrom  the  lower  10% earners to the top 10% earners  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   Everyone  should have a chance of  achieving  what\r\n\r\nthey aspire to achieve and their success or failure should be\r\n\r\nthe  outcome  of  their own effort and  capability,  and  not\r\n\r\nbecause we created some obstacles for some of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot just think of redistribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  we risk losing our wealth creators.  I  therefore\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  Government will continue  to  emphasise  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  equal opportunities for all Singaporeans,  which\r\n\r\nhas brought success for Singapore up to now.  I sincerely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbelieve  that in this new economy, it will be even easier  to\r\n\r\nmake that big jump, to create wealth for oneself, provided we\r\n\r\nhave a sufficiently well trained population.  It is therefore\r\n\r\ncritical that the Government equips all Singaporeans with the\r\n\r\nright  tools  so that they will be able to benefit  from  the\r\n\r\ntremendous opportunities that the new economy provides.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sure Members of this House will agree with me\r\n\r\nthat Singapore already allows a great deal of social mobility\r\n\r\nfor  everyone, no matter what their background is.  Over  the\r\n\r\nlast  35  years,  since independence, we have  seen  so  many\r\n\r\nexamples of families who have seen hardship and poverty,  and\r\n\r\nwho  have  later  broken out of their social  position  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of their children being given opportunities to  excel\r\n\r\nin their studies, thus allowing them to take on good and well\r\n\r\npaying  jobs.  Similarly, for those who are willing  to  work\r\n\r\nhard and improve themselves, they have been able to attain  a\r\n\r\nbetter  standing in society, because the country allows  them\r\n\r\nto  do so.  No Singaporean is expected to remain poor forever\r\n\r\nand our society allows everyone to rise up the ranks, whether\r\n\r\nin  position or in income earning ability.  This  is  what  I\r\n\r\nmean by equal opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government's answers to the new economy\r\n\r\nare  and  should  be the following.  First  of  all,  a  good\r\n\r\neducation  for  every Singaporean child, who  is  trained  to\r\n\r\nlearn  for  life  and  trained to  plug  into  the  knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.  We should never end up in a situation where a child\r\n\r\nfrom  a lower income family does not do well in studies as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the  family not being able to afford  it.   Every\r\n\r\nchild  should continue to be given equal opportunity to excel\r\n\r\nin  his or her studies, and our education system today allows\r\n\r\nit.   In  fact, I was surprised that the NCMP mentioned  free\r\n\r\neducation.  I thought we already have free education starting\r\n\r\nfrom   primary  school.   And  for  families   who   are   in\r\n\r\ndifficulties and cannot afford to pay school fees, there  are\r\n\r\nmany  avenues  of  help, and I have not come  across,  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency at least and I am sure many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers  will  agree, of any child who has not been  given  a\r\n\r\nchance to fulfil whatever level of education he or she  wants\r\n\r\nas a result of not being able to pay for it.  So I really did\r\n\r\nnot  understand the issue of free education that  the  Member\r\n\r\nbrought up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, an opportunity for all Singaporeans to be\r\n\r\nretrained  easily and affordably at any point of their  lives\r\n\r\nis  also an important thing that the Government should  focus\r\n\r\non.   We are already seeing problems of our older workers who\r\n\r\nhave  become  unemployable as a result of  their  old  skills\r\n\r\nbecoming   outdated  and  irrelevant  in  the  new   economy.\r\n\r\nInitiatives like the Skills Redevelopment Programme  and  the\r\n\r\nconcept  of life-long learning must continue to be  developed\r\n\r\nto address this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NCMP has a lot to learn about retraining. Even\r\n\r\ncleaners, the example that the Member brought up, can learn a\r\n\r\nlot, especially when we decide to automate and mechanise  the\r\n\r\nindustry.   I have actually seen training manuals two  inches\r\n\r\nthick that contain a lot of materials on how cleaning can  be\r\n\r\ndone more efficiently.  And I think our cleaners and our road\r\n\r\nsweepers  can benefit from such training and, as a result  of\r\n\r\nautomation and mechanisation, they will be able to earn a lot\r\n\r\nmore  income because of the higher value added that they  add\r\n\r\nto their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thirdly, a related issue which I think is very much\r\n\r\nrelevant in the new economy, as it was in the old economy, is\r\n\r\nthat  everyone should have access to affordable  housing  and\r\n\r\nmedical  care.  We should never over price these  necessities\r\n\r\nto  the  point  where only the well-off can get good  medical\r\n\r\ncare  and  good homes.  The Government has a direct  role  to\r\n\r\nplay  in ensuring this happens fairly and should continue  to\r\n\r\nbe  accountable  for equity in the future.   As  long  as  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  ensure  that every Singaporean  has  access  to\r\n\r\nhousing and medical care no matter what his income level  is,\r\n\r\nwe will continue to avoid any issue of envy or the feeling of\r\n\r\nbeing  left  out.   And I think we have many programmes,  eg,\r\n\r\nMedifund and the various top-up schemes and assistance\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschemes  that actually will be able to help families who  are\r\n\r\nnot able to afford such necessities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we should have sufficient safety nets to help\r\n\r\nthose in society who cannot keep up with the pace or who just\r\n\r\ncannot  overcome  the obstacles, so much so  that  they  have\r\n\r\ndifficulties in making ends meet.  No matter how much we  do,\r\n\r\nwe  will  always have such people in our society.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  is a fact of life in every country in the world.  There\r\n\r\ncan  never  be a situation where you have zero percentage  of\r\n\r\nthe  population who are in this position.  Comparatively,  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  have  too  serious a problem today,  if  we  compare\r\n\r\nourselves to even countries like the USA where there are many\r\n\r\npeople living on the streets.  We do not have a single family\r\n\r\nliving  on  the street in Singapore today.  And we  must,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, continue to systematically help such people who  will\r\n\r\ntend to lag far behind in society for whatever reasons.   We,\r\n\r\nso  far, have a good track record and should continue to keep\r\n\r\nit this way in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned, there will always be people who\r\n\r\nface tremendous problems and difficulties, and this is a fact\r\n\r\nof  life  in any country in the world.   Therefore,  hardship\r\n\r\ncases were present in Singapore in the last 30 years and they\r\n\r\nwill  continue to be present.  The real issue is how can  all\r\n\r\nof  us  reach out to such people and try to reach out, locate\r\n\r\nthem  and help them as much as we can through all the various\r\n\r\nschemes  that exist.  Therefore, we should not mistake  these\r\n\r\nhardship  cases  as  an  outcome of the  widening  of  income\r\n\r\ndisparities.  We should continue to evolve on how  we  handle\r\n\r\nand resolve such hardship cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the final analysis, the key solution of the\r\n\r\nwidening  income  disparities  is  to  balance  opportunities\r\n\r\nrather  than  balancing income levels through  artificial  or\r\n\r\nunrealistic  means.   Such an approach  which  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nadopted,  ie, levelling of opportunities, is more sustainable\r\n\r\nin  the  long run and will produce the best outcome  for  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We must not restrict the growth  of  the  top\r\n\r\nincome\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nearners and, at the same time, we should continue to focus on\r\n\r\nuplifting  the  lower income Singaporeans through  the  means\r\n\r\nthat  I  mentioned earlier.  Only then can we ensure a strong\r\n\r\nand  united  Singapore.  We are fortunate that the Government\r\n\r\nhas  already  proactively addressed  the  issue  of  widening\r\n\r\nincome gaps, and this is precisely why we will not run into a\r\n\r\nsituation of riots or unrest that the NCMP has brought up.  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the  NCMP  does not sufficiently  understand  the\r\n\r\nissues  of  the  new economy and therefore has raised  issues\r\n\r\nthat  are  so  misleading.  He needs to  plug  into  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy if he is serious about addressing such issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It has been proposed, as an\r\n\r\namendment, to leave out all the words after \"House\" in line 1\r\n\r\nto the end, and there to insert the words -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"(1) notes that globalisation and the knowledge economy\r\n\r\nare widening income disparities worldwide;\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) reaffirms the strategy of embracing globalisation to\r\n\r\ncreate growth and prosperity for Singaporeans; and\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) supports the Government's policies to equip all\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  benefit from the new economy, to  uplift  lower\r\n\r\nincome Singaporeans and to strengthen social cohesion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be left\r\n\r\nout, be left out.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Can I speak on the amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Yes, later on. Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I would like to speak in support of the amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion in the name of Mr Inderjit Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to the NCMP just now, I found that it is as if\r\n\r\nwe  were  all  caught in a time trap together  with  Rip  Van\r\n\r\nWinkle,  going  into  the 60s, hearing  all  the  stories  of\r\n\r\nindustrial  strike  actions  and demonstrations  on  workers'\r\n\r\nrights.    I  think  he has also forgotten that  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  trade unions had also changed and trade  unions  had\r\n\r\nalso modernised.  He recounted about the experience of a Hong\r\n\r\nKong gentleman\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwho  visited  him  and said, \"Oh, now,  they  are  all  doing\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\"  Trade unions have always been doing  businesses\r\n\r\nright from the beginning  -  cooperatives.  It is one of  the\r\n\r\nfeatures  of  European trade union movement that  cooperative\r\n\r\nbusinesses were started right from the beginning of the trade\r\n\r\nunion movement.  And even today, if you visit countries  like\r\n\r\nSweden  and  Germany, cooperatives run by unions have  always\r\n\r\nbeen  there.   But  there  may be  a  difference.   Those  in\r\n\r\nSingapore run by our NTUC are pretty successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks about Cabinet Ministers being in the trade\r\n\r\nunion   movement.   Perhaps  he  has  forgotten  our   unique\r\n\r\nhistorical struggle.  The PAP was founded by many leaders who\r\n\r\nhave trade union connections.  It is more than a gesture.  It\r\n\r\nis  more  a  pride that we have got Ministers  who  can  also\r\n\r\nrepresent our workers' rights at very, very high level in the\r\n\r\nCabinet  so that workers' rights are taken care of,  problems\r\n\r\nand  issues  discussed,  weighed and even  anticipated  right\r\n\r\nbefore  they arose.  The NTUC in Singapore has been  singular\r\n\r\nin  promoting  the trade union movement.  It highlighted  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  workers  in training and  retraining  that  are\r\n\r\nnecessary for the new economy.  It spearheaded programmes  to\r\n\r\nraise  funds and got the Government to co-fund and  today  we\r\n\r\nhave  this SRP programme which is being run by the  NTUC  for\r\n\r\nthe  retraining of workers.  So I find all these issues  that\r\n\r\nhe  has brought up rather misleading, but it is important for\r\n\r\nus  to  lay  clear before the public that these  issues  have\r\n\r\nactually been addressed before and some of the issues that he\r\n\r\nhas brought up are really misleading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk in support of Mr Inderjit Singh's motion.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out quite correctly that this inequality in income\r\n\r\nin  the  last 20 years in advanced countries like the US  and\r\n\r\nOECD  is quite an important fact.  There has been this rising\r\n\r\nincome inequality in these countries.  This is attributed  to\r\n\r\nseveral  important factors which he has already  highlighted.\r\n\r\nBut I would like to develop on some of them later on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole issue of income inequality actually arose\r\n\r\nfrom this report some  months ago on this phantom $133 worker\r\n\r\nthat the Straits Times reported.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> It is from the Statistics Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Yes, from the Statistics Department,\r\n\r\nbut I say \"phantom worker\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Then sack the Department.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> This issue arose from the Department\r\n\r\nof Statistics' paper on income disparity.  Of course, arising\r\n\r\nfrom  that  there have been many reports on this widening  of\r\n\r\nincome  gap  and many proposals on why and how such  gaps  as\r\n\r\nreflected in the Gini coefficient should be closed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic growth and income distribution has always been\r\n\r\nan   area   of   concern  by  economists,   politicians   and\r\n\r\njournalists. These issues attract popular interest because at\r\n\r\nbest they reflect a genuine concern for the well-being of our\r\n\r\nfellow men.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment motion recognizes our economy's openness\r\n\r\nand  the  globalization forces that sweep the world  economy,\r\n\r\nwith  so  much  technological  and  communication  technology\r\n\r\nadvances that are going on. These forces will have an  impact\r\n\r\non our society and will cause more advanced segments and less\r\n\r\nadvanced segments within the society to develop. We  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice, I believe,  but to embrace this because we are a very\r\n\r\nopen  economy.  The Government will have to continue to  take\r\n\r\nsteps  to  foster greater social cohesion and the  Government\r\n\r\nhas done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward some positions from economic\r\n\r\nstudies  that  we  must  see these widening  inequalities  in\r\n\r\nsociety in perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the Department of Statistics' paper of May\r\n\r\n2000, \"Is Income\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nDisparity Increasing In Singapore\", the Gini coefficient  was\r\n\r\nshown  to have increased from 0.446 in 1998 to 0.467 in  1999\r\n\r\nwhich showed a positive increase of 0.021. From 1990 to 1999,\r\n\r\nthe increase is 0.031.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the ratio of the average income of the 9th\r\n\r\ndecile  to the 2nd decile, the figure  rose from 5.5 in  1990\r\n\r\nto 6.8 in 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no doubt that there is a widening income\r\n\r\ndisparity in Singapore over the last decade, but we must also\r\n\r\nremember that the GDP in that period doubled, averaging at  a\r\n\r\ncompound rate of 7% per annum for a decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Government been taking action to lessen the\r\n\r\ndisparity at the lower end  by appropriate transfer of income\r\n\r\nand assistance schemes? The answer is yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the Government has realized that some years ago\r\n\r\nand that this is likely to be an enduring feature of our open\r\n\r\neconomy  at  this  stage  of  our development  where  we  are\r\n\r\nactually  embarking on a growth path, not  just  catching  up\r\n\r\nwith  the  advanced countries, or what they call \"catching-up\r\n\r\ngrowth\"  but  in  the  literature they  call  it  \"endogenous\r\n\r\ngrowth\",   ie,   growth  that  comes  with  technology.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment has, over the last few years put in all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nassistance  programmes such as rental and assistance  scheme,\r\n\r\nSC&CC  rebates  and  utilities rebates, RUAS  scheme,  public\r\n\r\nassistance and various personal tax rebates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Lollipops!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Lollipops to him, but not to many\r\n\r\npeople who need them. By the way, these lollipops cost a  few\r\n\r\nbillion  dollars.   These  schemes have  been  in  place  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years.   What have been the main driving  forces  in\r\n\r\nchanging the face of our economy over the last 10 years  that\r\n\r\nthese   will   have  a  significant  impact  on  our   income\r\n\r\ninequality?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to say that it is our increasing\r\n\r\nopenness and dependence on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  world  economy  in trade and also in  resource  factors.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  it  is the globalising force that is sweeping  the\r\n\r\nworld  economy.   Thirdly, it is the emphasis  we  have  been\r\n\r\nputting  in  raising our productivity, by raising  the  skill\r\n\r\ncontent  of  our exports and manufactures in  order  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive.  Otherwise, we will have less investments coming\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore.  Fourthly, it is the emerging  technological\r\n\r\nchanges  and  knowledge-based system that will determine  the\r\n\r\nnew employment profile in the New Economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These driving forces affect wages unevenly. Skilled\r\n\r\nlabour  gets  to do better and better because they  are  paid\r\n\r\nbetter and better.  Unskilled labour wage cannot rise as fast\r\n\r\nas the skilled ones.  Often times, there will be dislocations\r\n\r\nand  unemployment  where jobs and incomes  are  lost.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult of all this, there is income disparity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the high degree of our economic openness and the\r\n\r\nstate   of   globalising   forces  impacting   us   and   the\r\n\r\ntechnological  progress  that affects  the  growth  in  these\r\n\r\neconomies,  what  can  we  draw from  the  studies  of  these\r\n\r\ncountries' experience similar to ours?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news is that our experience is not unique. This\r\n\r\nmeans many countries like the US and the OECD countries  over\r\n\r\nthe  last 10 - 20 years, as pointed out by Mr Inderjit  Singh\r\n\r\njust  now,  have also exhibited this tendency towards  rising\r\n\r\nincome  inequality as their mature economies embark  on  more\r\n\r\nskill intensive technological growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that this issue of economic\r\n\r\ngrowth and income distribution over time and across countries\r\n\r\nhave  been an issue of considerable interest study since  the\r\n\r\n50s.  It is not a new subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first economists in this area of studies was\r\n\r\nthe   earlier  Nobel  Prize  winner,  Simon  Kuznets,   whose\r\n\r\nhypothesis  was  that economic growth would  generate  rising\r\n\r\nincome    and    wealth   inequality   during    the    early\r\n\r\nindustrialization period,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   later   a  declining  inequality  during   the   mature\r\n\r\nindustrialization period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hypothesis has always been controversial but in the\r\n\r\nlast  20 years, the experiences of the United States and  the\r\n\r\nOECD countries do not conform to this hypothesis of declining\r\n\r\nincome inequality at the mature stage, as rightly pointed out\r\n\r\nby  Mr Inderjit Singh. This is because the experience of  the\r\n\r\nOECD  countries has been one of sharp rise in wage inequality\r\n\r\nsince the early 70s to till today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies have also identified certain factors\r\n\r\nwhich  have  caused this tendency towards wage inequality  in\r\n\r\nthese  advanced mature economies. The most important of these\r\n\r\nis  skill biased technical change. Once an economy is engaged\r\n\r\nin   the  international  trade,  the  impact  of  trade  will\r\n\r\nreinforce  the  labour  saving  technologies  and  the  skill\r\n\r\nintensity  of  jobs  so that the wage inequality  is  further\r\n\r\ndeepened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of globalisation and the borderless world\r\n\r\nmeans  that  MNCs locate themselves all over the  world  such\r\n\r\nthat  they can produce at the lowest cost.  My colleague,  Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit  Singh,  has very elaborately highlighted  on  this.\r\n\r\nModern  communication means they can employ their  executives\r\n\r\nfrom  anywhere so that relative scarcity of labour skill  and\r\n\r\ntalents  is  transparent.   That means  executives  are  also\r\n\r\ncompeting  globally.  Workers are also  in  a  way  competing\r\n\r\nglobally,  except  that executives can  move  across  borders\r\n\r\nwhereas ordinary workers have to do so within the confines of\r\n\r\nborders.  Modern technology and communication also means much\r\n\r\nflatter  organization so that wider control can  be  executed\r\n\r\ngiving  productivity to the higher level executives, enabling\r\n\r\nthem  to  be better rewarded. Skill biased technical progress\r\n\r\nalso can substitute for unskilled labour.  That means that as\r\n\r\nprogress  is  introduced, more and more skill intensive  jobs\r\n\r\nwill  be  demanded.  It is complementary to  skilled  labour,\r\n\r\ndislocating  unskilled  labour  by  demanding  more   skilled\r\n\r\nlabour. In this process,  wages are made more unequal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driving force of technologies does not just cause\r\n\r\nincome  inequality across industries but also within industry\r\n\r\ndifferences.  This is due to more skilled  labour  having  to\r\n\r\nwork  with  newer  types  of capital requiring  more  updated\r\n\r\nskills, leading to better wage rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these driving forces of technology and change, our\r\n\r\nGovernment and the NTUC have prepared our workers for the new\r\n\r\nchallenge ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the NCMP has heard of ManPower 21, this new\r\n\r\nManpower Development Plan for the new economy.  He said we do\r\n\r\nnot  have  any scheme.  The NTUC raised funds for the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme,  which is  jointly  funded  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Today,  I  was told the demand  for  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme has been very good.  This will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our  workers  will  be continually  upgraded  in  their\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech has\r\n\r\njust   announced  a  $3  billion  package  to  target  social\r\n\r\nobjectives,   to  foster  greater  community  bonding   among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Many programmes have been in place  for  some\r\n\r\nyears,  such  as the asset enhancement scheme,  CPF  top-ups,\r\n\r\nrental  rebates  on  service  and  conservancy  charges,  and\r\n\r\nEdusave rewards which are aimed precisely at levelling up the\r\n\r\nlower  income  classes. This levelling  up  approach  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  approach. Otherwise, if the top income  earners  are\r\n\r\nconstrained,  our  dynamic  economy  will  suffer  and   more\r\n\r\nunemployment will result, when growth slows down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that happens those with skills and knowledge will\r\n\r\nmove  elsewhere,  reducing our potential for economic  growth\r\n\r\nand employment generation, bringing us into a vicious trap of\r\n\r\nslow growth and low income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment in the\r\n\r\nname  of Mr Inderjit Singh and I wish that the NCMP would  be\r\n\r\nbetter informed in future when he talks about the NTUC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, what I heard\r\n\r\nfrom  the two speakers were not unexpected at all.   This  is\r\n\r\nwhat we have been hearing ad nauseam.  What it boils down  to\r\n\r\nis  this.  Mr Inderjit Singh says it cannot be helped at all,\r\n\r\nlah.   It is globalisation, lah.  So there is nothing to  do.\r\n\r\nSo  sacrifice  the  worker at the altar of  capitalism.   The\r\n\r\nworker  is  to  be completely thrown onto the  rubbish  heap,\r\n\r\nbecause  he  has  no  place in the  society.   Talking  about\r\n\r\nimproving  skills, about 50% of our workers  have  less  than\r\n\r\nsecondary education.  So how are you going to teach  them  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the intricacies of machines and other things  that\r\n\r\nare needed?  Can you explain that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education, of course, is a very important thing. That\r\n\r\nis  why I say that we have got to see that every child  gets,\r\n\r\nwhat  they say, the same opportunity.  But how can  you  when\r\n\r\nthe  family is struggling to make its ends meet?  Expect  the\r\n\r\nfamily  also  to see that the children are properly  educated\r\n\r\nwhen  they have to pay school fees.  One of them said that  I\r\n\r\nwas  wrong in saying that there is no free education.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether he has got children.  But does he not  have\r\n\r\npaid something every month, because that is what every parent\r\n\r\ntells  me?   So  it  is  a sham to say  that  there  is  free\r\n\r\neducation in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no good just indulging in words - we must do\r\n\r\nsomething; we must do something; we must do something.  Spell\r\n\r\nout  your  measures. That is what is needed now.   Enough  of\r\n\r\nrhetoric.  And the amendment does not seek to spell  out  any\r\n\r\nmeasures.   It says, \"supports the Government's  policies  to\r\n\r\nequip  all  citizens to benefit from the new economy\".   What\r\n\r\nare  the  Government's policies?  We have not heard  anything\r\n\r\nabout  that.   What are the Government's policies  to  uplift\r\n\r\nlower  income Singaporeans?  I still say that what was handed\r\n\r\nout at the National Day Rally, are lollipops as are those  so\r\n\r\nmuch  vaunted rebates on rent and conservancy charges.   They\r\n\r\ndo  not  address  the  problem of the difficulties  faced  by\r\n\r\npeople  who are only earning $400 or $500 a month,  and  they\r\n\r\ncannot afford the basic things in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have set out a number of things that the Government\r\n\r\ncan do.  I am not here\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadvocating  that everyone should be paid the same.   That  is\r\n\r\nnot  what I am advocating. What I am saying here is  that  we\r\n\r\nhave got to see that in this globalisation, new economy, that\r\n\r\na  substantial portion of the population do not suffer  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  that.  Other developed countries have got  proper\r\n\r\nsafety  nets.   The UK government has got a  national  health\r\n\r\nservice and had it for years now, providing medical care  for\r\n\r\nthose  in  need.   Do  we  have  it?   They  have  an  Unfair\r\n\r\nDismissals Act.  They have enough protection for the  worker.\r\n\r\nDo  we  have them?  So are they saying, \"We can't do anything\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers.  It is all globalisation.\"   Societies  in\r\n\r\nthose countries will not tolerate that answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of saying that there is something that we can\r\n\r\ndo,  the poor worker has to accept globalisation.  Let us say\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  immoral that in a society like Singapore,  with\r\n\r\njust 3 - 4 million people, very rich in its foreign reserves,\r\n\r\nfor  30% of the people to be living at the poverty line.  Let\r\n\r\nus  have it openly, instead of indulging in all these  words,\r\n\r\nwords,  words, which is what we have had from the  Government\r\n\r\nand  from  its supporters.  The Government must do this,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must do that.  Let us have them.   What  are  you\r\n\r\ngoing to do?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, this amendment adds nothing to what we\r\n\r\nalready know and it does not say how the people who are  left\r\n\r\nout are going to be helped.  All it says is, it is a fact  of\r\n\r\nlife,  accept the fact of life, let us return to the  law  of\r\n\r\nthe  jungle.   Those who are able, those who are strong,  can\r\n\r\npush ahead.  Those who are weak, those who are disabled,  can\r\n\r\nall  just  be  left behind to die.  That is the  law  of  the\r\n\r\njungle.  Is that what we want in Singapore?  Or do we want  a\r\n\r\ncaring, humane society which says that we have a duty,  as  a\r\n\r\nsociety, to look after our needy, those who are unable to  do\r\n\r\nthings  for themselves.  I hear several complaints  from  the\r\n\r\ndisabled on how neglected they feel in Singapore.  But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  for  them  that  this motion is moved,  it  is  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers.   Shall  I say that, unless you also strengthen  the\r\n\r\nworkers' rights, you are not going to help them improve their\r\n\r\npositions,  and so try and lessen the gap.  It is  only  when\r\n\r\nthey have rights that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthey can do something to improve their position.  If you keep\r\n\r\nthem  as  serfs and tell them they have got to go  on  bended\r\n\r\nknees  to  the employers, then they cannot improve themselves\r\n\r\nand so lessen the inequalities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, I have not only these measures to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  workers' life, I have a number of other  social\r\n\r\nbenefits that should be granted.  Why can we not grant  them?\r\n\r\nWhy  can  we  not recognise that this 30% of our people  need\r\n\r\nthese  benefits  -  provide free medical care,  provide  free\r\n\r\neducation for their children.  That means, their parents will\r\n\r\nnot  have  to pay one cent.  Not keep saying, \"Oh, no  school\r\n\r\nfees.\", but the parents pay $15 a month for other things that\r\n\r\nare  provided in the school.  Why can we not have an  old-age\r\n\r\npension?  Have you given answer for that?  What is wrong with\r\n\r\nit when other countries have all got an old-age pension?  The\r\n\r\nCPF  is  not the answer.  Do all families have enough in  the\r\n\r\nCPF  to  meet their needs when they grow old?  Many  of  them\r\n\r\nwill have nothing, practically nothing.  So what do they  do?\r\n\r\nAnd  what  do  we do about the unemployment problem?   It  is\r\n\r\ngrowing.   So what do we do about them?  Just throw  them  on\r\n\r\nthe dust heap.  It is globalisation, it is globalisation.  So\r\n\r\nwe cannot do anything for you.  It is just bad luck!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to continue. I really cannot understand\r\n\r\nwhat  I  have heard this afternoon.  It comes as no surprise,\r\n\r\nbut  to  say the least, it is amazing that in a society  like\r\n\r\nours we should hear these views in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I did not originally\r\n\r\nplan to speak.  But listening to the NCMP, I thought I should\r\n\r\nrespond to some of the allegations that he has made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeping forces are affecting our life in Singapore and\r\n\r\nwill  affect  our  life  even more so, especially  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome workers in future.  There are now faster technological\r\n\r\nchanges that would affect\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  ability of our workers to hold jobs due to the fact that\r\n\r\nthe  competition that we face, the companies in Singapore are\r\n\r\nfacing,  will be more global rather than local.  As a  result\r\n\r\nof  these  two factors, our employees cannot expect full-time\r\n\r\nemployment  any more because their companies will restructure\r\n\r\nand restructure from time to time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP needs only to listen to the speech of DPM Tony\r\n\r\nTan  yesterday at the Manpower Summit which brought  together\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from the Government, employers  as  well  as\r\n\r\nunions  to understand the sweeping changes that have affected\r\n\r\nthe  world  and  are affecting Singapore; and listen  to  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  very carefully to understand and  appreciate\r\n\r\nwhat are being done for the ordinary folks in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do our workers need generally? Basically, I think\r\n\r\nthey  need three things: (1) fair remuneration; (2) fair play\r\n\r\nat  workplaces; and (3) job security.  All three of which are\r\n\r\nbeing  provided for by the unions in Singapore.  What we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  is not just to give them the basic but more than  just\r\n\r\nbasic, in order for them to enjoy a better life and in  order\r\n\r\nto   keep  enhancing  their  ability  to  provide  for  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the Employment Act and the\r\n\r\nneed  to  change the Employment Act and Industrial  Relations\r\n\r\nAct.   Yes,  there  will always be a need to  change  and  to\r\n\r\nreview  Acts  and  laws.  I agree.  But, first,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrecognise  the factors that would require us to review  these\r\n\r\nlaws.   And secondly, there is, of course, the need to change\r\n\r\nmindset.   That is what I think we all need to do, especially\r\n\r\nthose who do not understand the forces of globalisation  that\r\n\r\nare now affecting us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the Employment Act, Mr Jeyaretnam asked: who\r\n\r\nbenefits?  My answer is the workers have benefited from  this\r\n\r\nAct  because it has helped us to attain full employment  over\r\n\r\nthe  years,  and  this  is the best protection  that  we  can\r\n\r\nprovide  for  our workers in Singapore.  Because  in  a  full\r\n\r\nemployment situation not only would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  workers  be able to retain their jobs, but at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,   they  can  get  higher  salary.   In  the   face   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation where our workers cannot expect to  keep  their\r\n\r\njobs  for  life, what the unions, working with the Government\r\n\r\nand  employers, are doing is to ensure that they  are  better\r\n\r\nskilled and reskilled to be able to enjoy better quality jobs\r\n\r\nand better income in future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also spoke of the Industrial Relations Act\r\n\r\nand  the  fact  that our workers' right to  strike  has  been\r\n\r\nremoved.   He cannot be more wrong than that.  The unions  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   have   the  right  to  strike.    Mr   Jeyaretnam\r\n\r\nunderstands this.  But they choose not to strike because that\r\n\r\nwould  work  against the interest of the workers  themselves.\r\n\r\nThey  can strike if they get the support of more than 50%  of\r\n\r\ntheir members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCMP should look at some countries in Europe to\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  they  are  responding  to  these  forces  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  and  trying to protect the interest  of  their\r\n\r\nmembers  and workers, and we have seen this.  In one  meeting\r\n\r\nwith top leaders of a union from a European country, we asked\r\n\r\nwhether  they  had  forgone the approach of  striking.   Very\r\n\r\nquickly,  the  top  leader of the union  said,  \"We  are  now\r\n\r\nfocusing  on  partnership.\"  What is meant by  \"partnership\"?\r\n\r\nIt  means  that  they  are  now  working  more  closely  with\r\n\r\nemployers  by  establishing a partnership  institute.   While\r\n\r\nthey   talk   about   workers'  strike,  human   rights,   at\r\n\r\ninternational level, at home, they talk about ways to enhance\r\n\r\nthe  workers'  skills so that they can get  better  jobs  and\r\n\r\nbetter income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam also talked about the union's role for not\r\n\r\nserving their workers well.  Tripartism has been the hallmark\r\n\r\nof  our industrial relations in Singapore and it has done  so\r\n\r\nwell.   I  am very proud to say that so many unions from  all\r\n\r\nover the world are looking at our example, even though we  do\r\n\r\nnot  project  ourselves  as a model for  any  country.   They\r\n\r\nthought that it is worthy for them to come and watch  how  we\r\n\r\nare  doing things so that they can learn a thing or two.  And\r\n\r\nI am proud to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsay  that, despite the fact that they see the model  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  been practising for a long time, we are not ashamed  to\r\n\r\nlearn  from that trade union in Europe which is now  focusing\r\n\r\non  partnership.   We will learn from anywhere  in  order  to\r\n\r\nenhance further our services and protection for our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new challenges are many. In the past, we were\r\n\r\ntalking  about full employment and employment.   Now  we  are\r\n\r\ntalking about enhancing employability.  In the past, we  just\r\n\r\ntalked  about  cost competitiveness.  Now we talk  about  new\r\n\r\ncapability in productivity and innovation.  Sir, what we  are\r\n\r\nnow  doing  is  actually  focusing  on  job  creation,  skill\r\n\r\ncreation and employability enhancement for our workers.   And\r\n\r\nthese  are  the  best  protection that we  can  give  to  our\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam gives the impression that nothing is being\r\n\r\ndone  for  older  workers.  Again, he cannot be  more  wrong.\r\n\r\nBecause 80% of those who have gone through SRP training  have\r\n\r\nless than eight years of formal education and 70% of them are\r\n\r\nabove  40  years old.  Some 30,000 workers have been  trained\r\n\r\nunder  this Skills Redevelopment Programme and as  far  as  I\r\n\r\nknow,  we are trying to train 70,000 more people in the  next\r\n\r\nthree years.  If that is not helping workers to cope with the\r\n\r\nforces of globalisation, I do not know what is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, what is important is to help our workers\r\n\r\ncope  with the changes in the new economy rather than talking\r\n\r\nabout  doling  benefits to them.  It will not  help  them  in\r\n\r\nfuture.   You can give free medical services.  You  can  give\r\n\r\nfree of everything, but in the end, it will not help them  in\r\n\r\nthe long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam talked about the problems of having a\r\n\r\nCabinet  Minister  being  the  leader  of  the  trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement.   He sounds like the trade union leaders in  Europe\r\n\r\ntalking  about  us, probably about five to seven  years  ago.\r\n\r\nEven now, they are changing.  They are coming to discuss with\r\n\r\nus on what we have done for our workers that they can take  a\r\n\r\nlook at.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has fought for continuing education and training for\r\n\r\nour  workers?  It was NTUC.  Who fought for SRP and Education\r\n\r\nand Training Fund?  - $100 million a year and the Government,\r\n\r\nas  announced by the Prime Minister, has agreed to give  $500\r\n\r\nmillion more to a fund that will ultimately be $5 billion  in\r\n\r\nLifelong Education Fund. NTUC has a part in it.  And  because\r\n\r\nNTUC  is led by a Cabinet Minister, the workers' concerns  go\r\n\r\ndirect to the Cabinet and it has helped the workers.  Who has\r\n\r\nfirst articulated the view that CPF should be restored early?\r\n\r\nIt  was  NTUC.  And who during the recession tried  to  lower\r\n\r\ncosts  for ordinary Singaporeans?  It was NTUC, through  NTUC\r\n\r\nFairPrice,   and  various  other  cooperatives.    So   these\r\n\r\ncooperatives  are not just organisations which are  there  to\r\n\r\nmake  money.   We are in business because we are helping  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   Mr Jeyaretnam, we are in the business  of  helping\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is NTUC outnumbered in NWC? Again, he is very wrong.\r\n\r\nNTUC,  the Government and the employers have an equal  number\r\n\r\nof representatives on the NWC.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The Government is an employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> The Government is the representative\r\n\r\nof  the people.  He said that we are forcing Singaporeans and\r\n\r\nour workers to accept the effects of globalisation.  What  we\r\n\r\nare   doing   is  actually  helping  them  to  be   part   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation and benefit from it, and not run away from  it,\r\n\r\nbut overcome the forces and benefit from it.  He said that we\r\n\r\nshould  help those who are left out.  But we are not  helping\r\n\r\njust  those  who  have been left out, we  are  helping  those\r\n\r\nSingaporeans so that they are not left out.  So  before  they\r\n\r\nare  left  out, we want to help them through skills upgrading\r\n\r\nand other schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I can only summarise that Mr\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam has written the workers off.  What we are doing is\r\n\r\nthat we have tried to help our workers to overcome the forces\r\n\r\nof globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just quickly respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang. He\r\n\r\nexpressed concern over\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  widening income gap and workers older than 40 years  and\r\n\r\nthose  with low skills.  Every Singaporean should.   But  who\r\n\r\nfirst   identified  the  potential  dangers   of   structural\r\n\r\nunemployment?  It was NTUC.  It was in 1997, even before  the\r\n\r\nrecession  began.  And what did we do?  We did not  just  sit\r\n\r\ndown  and  talked  in  Parliament.  We  designed  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme and asked the Government to  fund  it\r\n\r\nand  raised it to be a national programme.  We also  realised\r\n\r\nthat  there would be workers who could not benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nSRP.   NTUC  itself  set up a fund called the  Education  and\r\n\r\nTraining  Fund.  We have raised $5 million and the Government\r\n\r\nhas  topped  up $15 million.   The Government has  agreed  to\r\n\r\ngive another $15 million if we can raise another $5 million - to raise the fund to $40 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very easy to talk about how to help the\r\n\r\nworkers,  but we should not just criticise efforts that  have\r\n\r\nbeen made or, worse still, not recognising what has been done\r\n\r\nfor the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the speaker, by way of\r\n\r\nclarification, what is this call by NTUC for a  new  contract\r\n\r\nthat  I  saw in the Straits Times on 23rd August.

I  would  like  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues here to step up the promotion of these  two  vital\r\n\r\ningredients that will help us become the gracious society  we\r\n\r\nenvisage.  In his 1996 New\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYear's  Day  Message,  Prime  Minister  Goh  suggested   that\r\n\r\nSingapore should aim to become a gracious society and  called\r\n\r\non    Singaporeans   to   complement   Singapore's   economic\r\n\r\nachievements with social, cultural and spiritual development.\r\n\r\nAgain,  at the debate on the President's Address in 1997,  he\r\n\r\nsaid  that his focus was on the need for Singapore to develop\r\n\r\n\"heartware\" and not just economic competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has achieved the economic success that we\r\n\r\ncan  be proud of, but have we achieved the same milestone  in\r\n\r\nsocial  success?   The  answer, I am afraid  to  say,  is  an\r\n\r\nobvious \"no\"!  In the past few weeks alone, we were bombarded\r\n\r\nwith  articles in the Straits Times on \"killer litter\",  maid\r\n\r\nabuse,  maids  falling to death while cleaning windows,  road\r\n\r\nbullies, violent patrons in cinemas, bond breakers and so on.\r\n\r\nThese   are  examples  of  more  extreme  irresponsible   and\r\n\r\ninconsiderate  acts.   There  are  many  less  severe   daily\r\n\r\noccurrences  ranging from urinating in lifts,  littering  and\r\n\r\nleaving rubbish on the common corridors of HDB flats, to  not\r\n\r\ngiving up seats to elderly people or pregnant women in  buses\r\n\r\nor MRT trains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we have attained remarkable\r\n\r\nachievements  and  we  have  received  accolades  from   many\r\n\r\ncountries  including our neighbours. We  have  a  world-class\r\n\r\nairport   and  seaport,  a  graft-free  society,  a  diligent\r\n\r\nworkforce  and  a high per-capita income. But  as  a  people,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  abroad, many Singaporeans  fail  to  endear\r\n\r\nthemselves to others by their lack of tact and by  their  too\r\n\r\nfreely   uttered   comments   on   the   inefficiencies   and\r\n\r\ninadequacies of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social graces and living graciously form part of the\r\n\r\nvalue  system of a society. It is about how we live  and  the\r\n\r\nquality  of our lifestyle.  It is about individuals  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity and extended communities in which they live. Social\r\n\r\ngraces are human acts that contribute to community and social\r\n\r\nbonding and thereby help build a more stable nation.   Social\r\n\r\ngraces are part of gracious society and life enrichment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in slightly more than one generation, Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmoved from the village \"kampong\" of low-rise buildings to the\r\n\r\ncity  of  high-rise buildings.  We are now entering the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury  and  beginning  our  move  into  cyberspace.   In  a\r\n\r\n\"kampong\"  society,  people  knew  their  neighbours,   their\r\n\r\nchildren  played  with  their neighbours'  children  and,  in\r\n\r\ngeneral, there was a great deal of interaction at all levels.\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of social support system and much sharing of\r\n\r\njoy  and  sorrow.   By  contrast, Sir,  the  modern  city  of\r\n\r\nSingapore appears to be a myriad of different people, looking\r\n\r\ndistinctive and detached.  Neighbours hardly know each  other\r\n\r\nwhen,  in  fact,  they  need to be on even  friendlier  terms\r\n\r\nbecause they live in ever increasing proximity as years go by\r\n\r\nand they cannot help but bump into each other every day. Sir,\r\n\r\nlife would be that much more pleasant if smiles and greetings\r\n\r\nwere  being exchanged at the start of each day.  And, at  the\r\n\r\nend  of  a  hectic day at work, it would be better to  return\r\n\r\nhome  to  a friendly neighbourhood and an environment without\r\n\r\nanimosity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans must be persuaded that social bonding\r\n\r\nand  neigbourliness are beneficial to all. Back in the 1950s,\r\n\r\nresearchers stumbled on a curious fact about the citizens  of\r\n\r\nRoseto,  Pennsylvania. Their age-adjusted heart  attack  rate\r\n\r\nwas   less   than   half  that  found  in  the   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncommunities.  The usual explanations were studied, and  ruled\r\n\r\nout.  There  was nothing special about their diet,  exercise,\r\n\r\nsmoking  habits, or genetic predisposition.   But  there  was\r\n\r\nsomething different about the little town. The immigrants who\r\n\r\nhad  founded  it in the 19th century had come from  the  same\r\n\r\nItalian  village, and they had created a tight-knit community\r\n\r\nin  its  likeness.  There were strong churches, a mutual  aid\r\n\r\nsociety,  and scout troops.  Rosetans were unusually  willing\r\n\r\nto  draw  on one another for financial and emotional support.\r\n\r\nThey  were  rich  in what today is called social  capital  or\r\n\r\nconnections  among  individuals - social  networks,  and  the\r\n\r\nnorms  of  reciprocity and trust that arise  from  them  that\r\n\r\nappeared to be the clue to their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealthy hearts.  Over the next decades, socially mobile young\r\n\r\npeople rejected their parents' way of life.  Newcomers  moved\r\n\r\nin.  By the 1980s, Roseto's new generation had a heart attack\r\n\r\nrate  a  little above that of their neighbours. As the Roseto\r\n\r\nstory suggests, people whose lives are rich in social capital\r\n\r\ncan cope better with traumas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being gracious is an attitude. Sir, our attitude towards\r\n\r\nothers is shaped by the people we are around with and by  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  and  situations we encounter.  A  lot  of  our\r\n\r\nattitudes were formed when we were young.  Parental influence\r\n\r\nis  a  very big factor.  If parents do not model graciousness\r\n\r\nin  their  daily living and interactions with their  children\r\n\r\nand  others, how can we expect their children to do so?   The\r\n\r\nchildren  then  carry these attitudes into adult  life.  When\r\n\r\nthey  have  their  own  children,  it  is  a  similar,  self-perpetuating  situation.  We need to arrest this perpetuating\r\n\r\ntrend now and reverse it by not just targeting the young  but\r\n\r\ntheir parents also.  The promotion of the basic elements of a\r\n\r\ngracious society - the responsible and considerate behaviours\r\n\r\nmust  be stepped up. While most people agree that we may  not\r\n\r\nbecome a socially developed nation overnight, the earlier  we\r\n\r\nstrive  for this, the better.  Best and speedier results  can\r\n\r\nonly be obtained if we have the will and the concerted effort\r\n\r\ninvolving  the Government, civil service providers and,  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  the people themselves.  The main  crux  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter   here   is   to  be  successful  in  convincing   our\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   that  socially  responsible  and   considerate\r\n\r\nbehaviours are beneficial to all and that we want to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  status  of  a socially developed country  to  match  our\r\n\r\neconomic  success. Singaporeans do not need  regulations  and\r\n\r\ndeterrent  punishments  if they are convinced  that  socially\r\n\r\nresponsible ways can make life better for one and all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we go about achieving the gracious society we\r\n\r\ndesire?    Sir,   I  would  like  to  offer   the   following\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Government must lead the way. The Government must\r\n\r\ncontinue and further demonstrate to be a caring Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSir,  this  Government must show the way for  the  people  to\r\n\r\nfollow.   More  resources  must be  put  into  the  focus  on\r\n\r\nfacilities  as  well  as  programmes  to  develop   Singapore\r\n\r\nsocially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Policy makers must conscientiously promote\r\n\r\ngraciousness.  Social and civil services policy makers should\r\n\r\nnow focus more on community bonding.  Our Government has done\r\n\r\nan  excellent  job in providing good quality housing  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.   The  common  corridor  design  of  the  older   HDB\r\n\r\napartments,  which facilitates interaction among  neighbours,\r\n\r\nhas  given way to new designs that allow greater privacy  but\r\n\r\nlessen interaction among neigbhours.  HDB must provide better\r\n\r\ndesigns  but,  at  the  same  time,  has  neigbourliness   as\r\n\r\npriority.   Our  policies, such as foreign spouses  who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  repatriated  because they have  AIDS,  resulting  in  a\r\n\r\nbreakdown of families and hardships is not the right kind  of\r\n\r\nmessage the Government wants to convey to the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just two examples. All our ministries,\r\n\r\nwhen  setting  out policies, should be consciously  promoting\r\n\r\nand  be  instrumental  in our efforts to  become  a  gracious\r\n\r\nsociety.  I hope our civil service will take the cue from  PM\r\n\r\nGoh and work towards a more gracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) All Singaporeans must make a concerted effort. No\r\n\r\ngovernment   can   mandate  people  to  be  considerate   and\r\n\r\nresponsible.  However, Ministers, MPs and grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nin  society can promote these attributes and set the example.\r\n\r\nSir, we can, together with our grassroots leaders, convey our\r\n\r\nnational  challenge  to  sustain a  prosperous  and  gracious\r\n\r\nSingapore  to our residents and imbue them with  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nnational purpose.  Being neighbourly is a start to building a\r\n\r\ngracious  society and we can make Singapore a nicer place  to\r\n\r\nlive in by our actions. The crux of the matter lies in making\r\n\r\npeople   see   that  socially  responsible  and   considerate\r\n\r\nbehaviours  are beneficial to all.  I would like  to  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  all  of  us promote the 5Cs of gracious living  to  our\r\n\r\nresidents in our respective\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwards.  These  5Cs  are  the  attributes  of  being  cordial,\r\n\r\ncourteous, caring, considerate and cultured constituents.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the People's Association's involvement in  this\r\n\r\npromotion   will  have  beneficial  results   especially   in\r\n\r\ncoordinating  with our grassroots organisations  and  in  co-sponsoring   the  different  activities  organised   by   our\r\n\r\ncommunity centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Graciousness as second nature in our young. Sir,\r\n\r\nour  young will be the future of Singapore. Effort should  be\r\n\r\nstepped  up  especially for this group when they are  at  the\r\n\r\nsusceptible years. Starting from as early as pre-school, just\r\n\r\nin  very  simple story-telling with an activity to  reinforce\r\n\r\ntheir  learning will be useful. Children pick up things  very\r\n\r\nquickly.   Learning to be gracious is not quite like learning\r\n\r\na  textbook subject. The goal is to make graciousness  second\r\n\r\nnature.  More innovative ways of imbuing this attitude in our\r\n\r\nstudents   have  to  be  delivered  in  our  school   system.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  schools  have life skills and  community  service\r\n\r\nprogrammes  that they can broadly interpret  and  apply.  The\r\n\r\nsuccess  of  these  programmes  of  course  hinges   on   the\r\n\r\nleadership of the principals and the teachers concerned.  The\r\n\r\nteacher  who  teaches it must model graciousness  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself.  The  teacher  must believe in  it.   The  emotional\r\n\r\nquotient  (EQ)  of its people is invaluable if  Singapore  is\r\n\r\ngoing to continue in its success in the new millennium.  What\r\n\r\nemphasis  the  Government places on life skills and  personal\r\n\r\ndevelopment in the school curriculum (of course balanced with\r\n\r\nthe  academic)  will  ultimately  determine  the  success  of\r\n\r\nSingapore becoming a gracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Expansion of national campaigns. The Singapore\r\n\r\nKindness  Movement, which focuses on small acts of  kindness,\r\n\r\nwas launched in January 1997, in response to PM Goh's call to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  more gracious society.  It has made inroads  into\r\n\r\nschools  with some imaginative programmes.  It has also  gone\r\n\r\nto the nurseries and kindergartens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this movement should be further supported to expand\r\n\r\nits programmes to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntarget  more  people in our population and to be more  active\r\n\r\nand  innovative  throughout the  whole  year.   The  National\r\n\r\nCourtesy  Campaign has also made good progress over the  past\r\n\r\n22  years and should therefore expand further to reap  better\r\n\r\nresults  on wider audience.  More mass media use by them  can\r\n\r\nbring  about a culture of kindness and consideration  amongst\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Promotion of culture and the arts. A vibrant\r\n\r\nsociety  is  not only reflected in its economy.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nreflected in its culture and the arts.  The appreciation  and\r\n\r\nthe  love  of literature and the arts are aspects of gracious\r\n\r\nliving.  We  should heed the Chinese saying, lao ye  jie  he,\r\n\r\nwhich  means \"strike a proper balance between work and play\".\r\n\r\nThere  are many areas for improvement to further develop  our\r\n\r\narts scene here.  I am glad that the arts will receive a  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  extra funding as part of Government's plans to  turn\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  a  world-class city with a vibrant  cultural\r\n\r\nscene.   The  key  to  the success of Government's  five-year\r\n\r\ninvestment in the arts is that the audience base must grow in\r\n\r\ntandem with the funding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will be no good if we could afford stage\r\n\r\nproduction  after stage production with no audience  support.\r\n\r\nHence,  more effort must be spent in this area. The flagship-companies  scheme must also include training  and  developing\r\n\r\ntalent,  churning  out  productions  that  are  creative  and\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the audience level and opening their  doors\r\n\r\nbeyond the exclusive clique of the artistes and taking on the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of bringing the arts to a wider audience.   In\r\n\r\nmany  major  cities  of  the  world,  parks  are  areas   for\r\n\r\nrelaxation and are ideal locations for sculptures.  We do not\r\n\r\nhave the luxury of the land here, but the banks of our rivers\r\n\r\nand canals can be further maximised for this purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by referring to what Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh said when he addressed grassroots organisations\r\n\r\nat the Triennial Conference in 1994, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Our challenge is how to sustain our prosperity and\r\n\r\ncontinually  improve  the non-material, moral  and  spiritual\r\n\r\naspects  of  our lives.  Beyond prosperity, we  can  build  a\r\n\r\ngracious society, a good society, a society of distinction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Dr Lily Neo has identified\r\n\r\nhaving  responsibility and consideration for  others  as  the\r\n\r\nbuilding blocks for a gracious society.  I thank her for  her\r\n\r\nmany  suggestions  and I am very sure my  colleagues  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious   Ministries  will  respond  and  look   into   these\r\n\r\nsuggestions put forward by her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our vision in Singapore 21 is to make Singapore our\r\n\r\nbest  home.  If Singapore is just a place for people to  make\r\n\r\nmoney,  earn a good living, and nothing more than that,  then\r\n\r\nour  vision will not come through.  What we need to do is  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  strengthen our social foundation,  inject  more\r\n\r\ncivility  into  our  daily life and  make  Singapore  a  more\r\n\r\npleasant and gracious place for all to live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every day we come into contact with many people.\r\n\r\nSome are friends and colleagues we have known for years.   So\r\n\r\nit  is only natural that we treat them with human decency and\r\n\r\ncourtesy.   This is good, but this is not good enough.   This\r\n\r\nis not good enough to make us a gracious society, because our\r\n\r\nreal  challenge  is for everyone to learn to respect  others,\r\n\r\nnot  just friends whom we have known for years, but  also  to\r\n\r\nrespect strangers whom we may be meeting for the first  time,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  their stations in life.  This  may  not  come\r\n\r\nnaturally  for many Singaporeans yet, but we must  try.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  when we sit down at a hawker centre and  a  cleaner\r\n\r\ncomes  along to clean the table, do we grab our things, cover\r\n\r\nour  nose,  turn our body and mumble to ourselves,  \"Hmm,  so\r\n\r\nsmelly!\"?  Or do we smile, look at him or her in the eyes and\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Thank you for cleaning my table\"?  It is actually  not\r\n\r\nso difficult, only if we try.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, if we are in a restaurant or in a shop, do we\r\n\r\ngo  around  ordering the sales staff because the customer  is\r\n\r\nking, or do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  put  across our request politely and thank them  for  the\r\n\r\nservice  and show our appreciation?  The question really  is:\r\n\r\nwhose job it is to turn Singapore into a gracious society?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one day, there was a job to be done. Four persons\r\n\r\ncame together.  Their names were Everybody, Somebody, Anybody\r\n\r\nand  Nobody.  Everybody thought that this job should be  done\r\n\r\nby Somebody.  Anybody could have done the job but, at the end\r\n\r\nof the day, Nobody did the job.  So Everybody was very upset,\r\n\r\nbecause  Anybody  could  have done the  job.   They  expected\r\n\r\nSomebody  to take the lead, but it ended up Nobody doing  it.\r\n\r\nSo,  you  have a situation whereby Everybody blamed Somebody,\r\n\r\nwhere actually Anybody could have done the job that ended  up\r\n\r\nwith Nobody doing it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is quite clear that we can only become a\r\n\r\ntruly gracious society only if every Singaporean plays a part\r\n\r\nand  make  mutual  respect for others  our  way  of  life  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I want to assure Dr Neo and Members of this House\r\n\r\nthat the Government will surely do its part to ensure that we\r\n\r\ncreate the environment for this to take place.  But as Dr Neo\r\n\r\nhas suggested, all Singaporeans must make a concerted effort.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, instead of calling for the Government to take\r\n\r\nthe  lead  and for the policy makers to promote and act,  why\r\n\r\nnot let all of us in Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntake the lead together so that we can get there sooner rather\r\n\r\nthan later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us can observe each other and learn from\r\n\r\neach  other  every day all the time.  We can look around  us,\r\n\r\nobserve how our fellow Singaporeans behave and interact  with\r\n\r\neach  other.  If we like what we see, let them be the windows\r\n\r\nof  our  life.  Look out of the windows and learn from  their\r\n\r\ngraciousness.   If  we  do not like  what  we  see  in  their\r\n\r\nbehaviour, then let them be our mirror in life.  Look at  the\r\n\r\nmirror  and  ask, \"Do we behave this way too?\"  Reflect,  and\r\n\r\nlearn from other's mistakes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to say that in the\r\n\r\nspirit  of  Singapore  21,  I join  Dr  Neo  in  calling  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to step forward as active citizens,  strengthen\r\n\r\nour  social  foundation and reinvent the  Singapore  society.\r\n\r\nWorking  together, we can, and in PM's words, \"build  a  more\r\n\r\ngracious   society,  a  good  society  and   a   society   of\r\n\r\ndistinction.\"    Hopefully, let us do it sooner  rather  than\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Nine Minutes</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to Six o'clock pm to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720771.gif\">Graph - Average Electricity Tariff and Fuel Oil Price (Cols. 771 - 772)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000825/20000825-HA-0720773.htm\">Page - Rebates for Utilities Bill (Cols. 773 - 774)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>NOT ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARSHIPS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will consider giving (i) more  varieties  of\r\n\r\nscholarships in terms of varying years of bonding and  amount\r\n\r\nof  pecuniary  involvement; (ii) prestige or  acknowledgement\r\n\r\nscholarships  with  no  monetary  involvement;    and   (iii)\r\n\r\nscholarships  with  flexible terms  like  deferment  of  bond\r\n\r\nservice for further postgraduate courses and/or training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government scholarships today already vary in terms of\r\n\r\nthe  years  of  bond,  as  well as in  the  pecuniary  amount\r\n\r\ninvolved.  The  number  of years of bond  associated  with  a\r\n\r\nscholarship  depends  on the type of  award  and  country  of\r\n\r\nstudy.  For PSC, for example, the bond is 6 years for US  and\r\n\r\nUK,  5  years for France, Germany, Japan and the PRC,  and  4\r\n\r\nyears  for  the local scholarships. The amount of sponsorship\r\n\r\nalso  varies across countries, depending on the cost  of  the\r\n\r\nuniversity  education as well as the cost of living.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthe liquidated damages vary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Government scholarships are given for the purpose of\r\n\r\nidentifying,  inducting and grooming talent  for  the  public\r\n\r\nsector.  Thus,  the Government is not in favour  of  awarding\r\n\r\nprestige nor acknowledgement scholarships without the scholar\r\n\r\nmaking  a  commitment to serve in the public  service  (Since\r\n\r\n1993,  President  Scholarships have not  been  awarded  on  a\r\n\r\nnominal  basis to individuals.  The last time it was  awarded\r\n\r\nnominally,  was  to  a  scholar to  pursue  Medicine  at  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Cambridge in 1992.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already much flexibility in the treatment of\r\n\r\nGovernment  scholars.   First, scholarship  bonds  have  been\r\n\r\nshortened  from 6-8 to 4-6 years to keep up with  the  times.\r\n\r\nScholars  are now encouraged to pursue a much wider range  of\r\n\r\ndisciplines.  Many scholarships also allow scholars who  meet\r\n\r\nthe  criteria  to go for postgraduate studies.  For  example,\r\n\r\nthose on the SAF, SPF or PSC's Overseas Merit Scholarships or\r\n\r\nOMS,  have  a Master's programme worked in as part  of  their\r\n\r\nscholarship terms, as long as they complete their studies  in\r\n\r\n4  years.   There  are  also about 10 PSC  scholars  who  are\r\n\r\npursuing  doctoral programmes.  On getting their PhDs,  their\r\n\r\nbonds may be transferred to the local Universities or to  one\r\n\r\nof  our  public  sector  research  institutions.   Government\r\n\r\nscholars  also  go  for  industrial and research  attachments\r\n\r\nlocally and overseas with our blessings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCHOLARSHIP BONDS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  (a) whether there is a rising trend, over the  last\r\n\r\nfive   years,   of  Government  scholars  who   broke   their\r\n\r\nscholarship  bonds;  (b) whether the  scholar's  parents  and\r\n\r\nguardians should be required to sign a performance bond for a\r\n\r\nspecific  sum, on the basis that they can exert  their  moral\r\n\r\ninfluence  on the scholars; and (c) whether fiscal  deterrent\r\n\r\nmeasures  can  be  imposed  by requiring  the  bond-breakers'\r\n\r\nprospective  employers to recompense the bond  on  a  non-tax\r\n\r\ndeductible basis and requiring the bond-breakers to be  taxed\r\n\r\nin full for any reimbursement made by their employers towards\r\n\r\nthe bond payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the PSC is the largest scholarship provider, I asked\r\n\r\nthem  for  their statistics.  The figures show that over  the\r\n\r\nlast five years, the number of PSC scholars who have broken\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbond  each  year,  as  a proportion of the  total  number  of\r\n\r\nscholars currently in service under bond, has fallen from  5%\r\n\r\nin  1995  to  2%  in 1999.   In PSC's experience,  the  bond-breaking rate rises when the economy is doing well,  and  our\r\n\r\nsalaries   get   out  of  line  with  the   private   sector.\r\n\r\nConversely, the rate falls when the economy is not  doing  so\r\n\r\nwell.  This is only natural.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that the proportion of bond-breakers is\r\n\r\nlow.   The  newspaper debate that followed the  Sunday  Times\r\n\r\nfront-page  article had created an exaggerated impression  of\r\n\r\nthe  severity  of the problem.  We should see this  issue  in\r\n\r\nperspective,  otherwise  we  would  be  unfair  to  the  vast\r\n\r\nmajority of scholars who did not break their bonds and who do\r\n\r\nnot intend to break their bonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Government scholarship deed requires two sureties.\r\n\r\nThe  scholar accepts the scholarship with the full knowledge,\r\n\r\nconsent  and approval of the two sureties.  The sureties  are\r\n\r\nusually  the  parents, immediate relatives and  close  family\r\n\r\nfriends.   Thus, when a scholar is thinking of  breaking  his\r\n\r\nbond,  he  not  only has to consider his moral obligation  to\r\n\r\nserve,  but  also the trust and expectations his parents  and\r\n\r\nsureties have of him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tax system is set up for a larger purpose.

However, the volume of building works is  expected\r\n\r\nto remain stagnant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there is a time lag between the award of contract and\r\n\r\nthe  progress payments made, the construction industry  could\r\n\r\nmove  into  positive value-added growth towards  the  end  of\r\n\r\n2001.   This  is  provided that the good performance  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy is maintained over the next two years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To boost the construction demand and to take advantage\r\n\r\nof  the  competitive tender prices, the Government  has  been\r\n\r\nlooking  at  ways  to advance some of the infrastructure  and\r\n\r\ninstitutional  projects.  The number of projects  awarded  by\r\n\r\nthe  public  sector rose by 25% in 1999, although  the  total\r\n\r\nvalue  of  projects still fell.  This is mainly due to  lower\r\n\r\ntender  prices. The Government will continue to look at  ways\r\n\r\nto  advance  the  public sector projects, particularly  those\r\n\r\nthat  are  nearing  the tender calling  stage.   However,  as\r\n\r\nconstruction projects would need a few years to complete, any\r\n\r\naction taken now will not lead to immediate results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local contractors would inevitably be affected by the\r\n\r\nfall  in  construction demand. According  to  BCA's  records,\r\n\r\nlocal  contractors have been concentrating  their  activities\r\n\r\nmainly  in  building projects. To soften the  impact  and  to\r\n\r\navoid  being  adversely affected by  the  slow  down  in  the\r\n\r\nbuilding  workload,  local  contractors  should  consolidate,\r\n\r\nmerge  or  diversify their operation to participate in  large\r\n\r\nscale  infrastructure works.  They should also use this  time\r\n\r\nto  improve their productivity, skills and competitiveness to\r\n\r\nprepare for the recovery of the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NOISE POLLUTION</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment   whether  he  will  consider  installing   sound\r\n\r\nbarriers to reduce traffic noise pollution along expressways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chong Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Goh Chong Chia</b> asked the Minister for the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  as  vehicles  and  MRT  trains  are  additional\r\n\r\nsources  of noise when they pass near residential  areas  and\r\n\r\nschools,   whether  he  will  consider  introducing  acoustic\r\n\r\nbarriers to reduce the impact of the noise to the residential\r\n\r\nareas and schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been working closely with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Communications  and  Information  Technology,  and   the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development to reduce the noise  problem\r\n\r\nfrom vehicles and MRT trains on nearby residential areas  and\r\n\r\nschools.   Some of the measures taken include the  imposition\r\n\r\nof   set-back  distance  on  roads  and  train  tracks   from\r\n\r\nresidential  buildings, noise standards for  new  and  in-use\r\n\r\nvehicles,  road design, and the use of low-noise MRT  trains.\r\n\r\nStudies  have  shown  that the noise  levels  at  residential\r\n\r\nbuildings and schools near roads and MRT tracks are generally\r\n\r\nwithin the guidelines adopted by ENV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority previously studied the use\r\n\r\nof  noise  barriers  along expressways. It  found  that  such\r\n\r\nbarriers   may  not  be  effective  in  shielding  noise   in\r\n\r\nSingapore's   high-rise   setting,   because   they    cannot\r\n\r\neffectively block the noise on the higher floors, unless they\r\n\r\ncompletely envelop the entire expressway.  Nevertheless,  LTA\r\n\r\nwill  study each case on its own merits, and if feasible  and\r\n\r\neffective, will consider erecting noise barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must recognise however that in land-scarce and highly-urbanised Singapore, some degree of noise pollution is\r\n\r\ninevitable.   While  we can impose certain building  set-back\r\n\r\nand   other  requirements  at  the  planning  stage  for  new\r\n\r\ndevelopments, there is much less room to reduce noise problem\r\n\r\nin  built-up areas with an intensive road network  and  heavy\r\n\r\ntraffic flows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TRAFFIC CONGESTION ALONG THE CENTRAL EXPRESSWAY</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications and Information Technology how he proposes  to\r\n\r\nsolve  the  traffic congestion problem at the  Braddell  Road\r\n\r\nexit along Central Expressway towards Ang Mo Kio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many motorists travelling along the Central Expressway\r\n\r\n(CTE)  towards  Ang Mo Kio exit at Braddell Road  during  the\r\n\r\nevening  peak hours.  The Braddell Road exit leads  into  the\r\n\r\njunction  of  Braddell Road/CTE under the CTE flyover.

The Land  Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority is currently constructing a 3-level interchange  at\r\n\r\nthis  junction.  A vehicular underpass is being built to take\r\n\r\nthe  main  Braddell  Road traffic under this  junction,  thus\r\n\r\navoiding  the  traffic signals.  Work, which is in  progress,\r\n\r\nwill  be completed by end of 2002. Once this main traffic  is\r\n\r\ntaken away from this signalised junction, more green time can\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  the CTE Braddell Road exit.  The traffic  flow\r\n\r\nalong the Braddell  Road exit will then be smoother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNDERGROUND PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nCommunications   and  Information  Technology   whether   his\r\n\r\nMinistry   will  consider  building  underground   pedestrian\r\n\r\nwalkways  to  link  up  City Hall MRT station  to  the  major\r\n\r\ncommercial buildings in North Bridge Road/High Street area to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  road  safety and ease  the  traffic  congestion\r\n\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it is cost effective to do so, the Land Transport\r\n\r\nAuthority  (LTA) will provide underground linkages  from  MRT\r\n\r\nstations  to nearby major developments.
