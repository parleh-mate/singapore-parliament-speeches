We shall do our best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are a hard-headed people. If we\r\n\r\nmaintain  group discipline, if everyone contributes\r\n\r\nhis  fullest  share  of physical  and  intellectual\r\n\r\neffort to the fulfilment of our plans, we shall not\r\n\r\nfail.  We  can  and we shall build up  an  adequate\r\n\r\ndefence  force before the 1st of January, 1972.  We\r\n\r\ncan  counter  recession, expand our economy,  train\r\n\r\nand   educate   artisans,   technicians   and   the\r\n\r\ntechnocrats of our growing industrial and servicing\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, as British forces withdraw\r\n\r\nand  leave Singapore and Malaysia to make their own\r\n\r\narrangements  for  security,  we  shall  find   out\r\n\r\nwhether, as a community, we are like a creeper or a\r\n\r\ntree.  Both  the  creeper  and  the  sapling   need\r\n\r\nsupport.  But unlike a creeper, a sapling does  not\r\n\r\nneed  support  as it grows older and  stronger.  It\r\n\r\nwill  grow  into  a  tree  and  dispense  with  the\r\n\r\nsupporting  stake. No amount of aid and assistance,\r\n\r\ngrants and loans, technical assistance and training\r\n\r\ncan  do  the job which we must do for ourselves.  A\r\n\r\npeople  who are by nature creepers must,  when  the\r\n\r\nstake  they  have been leaning on is removed,  fall\r\n\r\nand  crawl on the ground. If we are that sort of  a\r\n\r\nsociety,  then  even with all this  brave  talk  by\r\n\r\nleaders  and  encouraging noises by  observers  and\r\n\r\ncommentators,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  all  the fine words of comfort and promise  of\r\n\r\naid,  we will still find ourselves crawling on  the\r\n\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the manifestations of the last decade\r\n\r\npoint to a sapling growing sturdier and stronger as\r\n\r\nit  matures into an upright tree. The stake,  which\r\n\r\nthe  British presence provided, has enabled sapling\r\n\r\nSingapore  to grow straight and tall without  being\r\n\r\ntoo  buffeted by the winds while it is still  young\r\n\r\nand fragile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must have that spirit of self-reliance and\r\n\r\nself-respect  as  a  community  if  we  are  to  be\r\n\r\ncompared to a tree. To join the growing numbers  of\r\n\r\ncountries  who  beg  for alms  from  the  developed\r\n\r\ncountries,  would destroy our pride  and  undermine\r\n\r\nour self-confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a number of countries, after gaining\r\n\r\nindependence,   have   failed   economically    and\r\n\r\ncollapsed   socially.  They  lacked  one  essential\r\n\r\nquality:  self-discipline, either in their leaders,\r\n\r\nor  more  often  both in their  leaders  and  their\r\n\r\npeople.  It requires self-discipline to budget  and\r\n\r\nlive  within  your means, when you can  just  print\r\n\r\nmore money. It requires self-discipline to maintain\r\n\r\nthe  integrity  and  efficiency of  government  and\r\n\r\nadministration  and  to  punish   and   keep   down\r\n\r\ncorruption,   especially  in  high  places.   Self-indulgence  would soon lead to personal wealth  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  for  the few, the political leaders,  the\r\n\r\nmilitary     chieftains,    and    the    principal\r\n\r\nadministrators.  Whatever  the  evils  of  British,\r\n\r\nFrench,  or  Dutch  colonial administrations,  they\r\n\r\nprovided   firm,  rigid  frameworks  within   which\r\n\r\nconstructive  endeavour was rewarded.  Seldom  were\r\n\r\ncolonial  budgets ever in deficit. They  invariably\r\n\r\nspent  less than what they got out of each  colony,\r\n\r\nfor  colonies were intended to provide profits, not\r\n\r\nincur losses. They kept stern discipline and stable\r\n\r\nconditions,  sound currencies, good sanitation  and\r\n\r\nhealthy  conditions. It is sad to see how  in  many\r\n\r\ncountries,  national heroes have let their  country\r\n\r\nslide   down  the  drain  to  filth  and   squalor,\r\n\r\ncorruption and degradation, where the kick-back and\r\n\r\nthe  rake-off  has become a way of  life,  and  the\r\n\r\nwhole country sinks in self-debasement and despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the political leadership ever allows Singapore\r\n\r\nto  degenerate into these conditions, then we shall\r\n\r\nperish. For we have not got that agricultural  base\r\n\r\nwhere  you can scatter seed on the ground, and  the\r\n\r\nsoil,  the  rain and the sun will produce  you  the\r\n\r\nrice,  the corn and the fruits with which  to  feed\r\n\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, with imaginative and\r\n\r\nintelligent  leadership  and  stiff  standards   of\r\n\r\nhonest and just administration, we can make maximum\r\n\r\nuse  of  our  resources  which  are  not  all  that\r\n\r\nslender.   We  have  not  often  underlined   these\r\n\r\nvaluable resources. Let me enumerate them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have more than average human\r\n\r\nintelligence,  diligence,  skills,  knowledge   and\r\n\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our superb geographic location at the\r\n\r\nsouthernmost   tip  of  the  continent   of   Asia,\r\n\r\nstraddling  the  route between the Indian  and  the\r\n\r\nPacific  Oceans,  the  northern  and  the  southern\r\n\r\nhemispheres. We have been important for  150  years\r\n\r\nas  a great sea junction. And for the last 20 years\r\n\r\nwe  have  also grown in importance as a  great  air\r\n\r\njunction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  may  remember  the  Maltese  Labour\r\n\r\nleader,  Mr Born Mintoff, visiting us in  December\r\n\r\n1967. A Rhodes scholar, he does not lack perception\r\n\r\nor  articulation. After a few days in Singapore, he\r\n\r\nsaid,   privately  and  publicly  over  radio   and\r\n\r\ntelevision,  that  Singapore was  better  off  than\r\n\r\nMalta  because Singapore did not have to  face  the\r\n\r\nstiff  competition that the Maltese face from their\r\n\r\nneighbours. In other words, the Italians in  Naples\r\n\r\nand  Genoa, the Greeks in Athens and the French  in\r\n\r\nMarseilles, all have higher skills and work  harder\r\n\r\nand so take business away from Malta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the passive into the active tense, it\r\n\r\nmeans  that  we work harder, are better  organised,\r\n\r\nand   more  efficient  than  many  others  in   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood. We sell the same things cheaper,  we\r\n\r\ndo  the same job for a lower price, and we offer to\r\n\r\nbuy the same produce at better prices than anywhere\r\n\r\nelse in the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third asset is the accumulation of 150 years\r\n\r\nof  infrastructure  and  experience,  in  commerce,\r\n\r\nindustry  and  communications. This does  not  mean\r\n\r\njust  the  physical buildings, the ports, airports,\r\n\r\nwarehouses,  roads, banks, shops,  power  stations,\r\n\r\nwater-works, telephones and cables. More  important\r\n\r\nare  the invisibles, the accumulations of knowledge\r\n\r\nand  expertise; how to run the port and the airport\r\n\r\neconomically  and efficiently; how to  keep  up  to\r\n\r\ndate  with containerised ships and jumbo jets; what\r\n\r\nbanking,  money, finance, stocks and shares,  bills\r\n\r\nof lading, and insurance are about; how and what to\r\n\r\nbuy in bulk from the industrial countries and break\r\n\r\nbulk  to retail in the area, and conversely how  to\r\n\r\nbuy  retail  and  package in  bulk  for  export  to\r\n\r\nindustrial  countries. This requires a well-trained\r\n\r\nprofessional,   managerial  and  executive   elite,\r\n\r\nsupported   by   a  well  educated,   skilled   and\r\n\r\nindustrious working population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing can more emphasise the importance of\r\n\r\nthese  three factors than if hon. Members  were  to\r\n\r\nconsider  what  would happen if Singapore  did  not\r\n\r\nhave  these three assets: the human resources,  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  geographic location,  and  the  built-up\r\n\r\ninfrastructure both physical structure and the know-how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine what would happen if we towed Singapore\r\n\r\nout and left it in the middle of the South Pacific.\r\n\r\nInstead   of   two  million  active  and   vigorous\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  you  have South-sea  Islanders  with\r\n\r\nflowers in their hair, dancing to languorous tunes.\r\n\r\nAlso,  instead of having the enormous sea  and  air\r\n\r\ntraffic,  and  the stimulus of people bringing  new\r\n\r\nideas, we have South-sea Islanders lounging on  the\r\n\r\nbeach,  watching  the occasional  cargo  ship  drop\r\n\r\nanchor. Then we would never have developed what  we\r\n\r\nhave: three deep-sea harbours, Tanjong Pagar,  with\r\n\r\nberthing   alongside  for  30   ships,   Sembawang,\r\n\r\nservicing what was up till very recently one of the\r\n\r\ngreatest  navies in the world, the deepwater  berth\r\n\r\nat Jurong, not to mention Telok Ayer Basin, Collyer\r\n\r\nQuay and Kallang Basin, the earliest harbours in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  days  of the sailing ships. We would not  have\r\n\r\nfour  airfields,  Paya Lebar,  Tengah,  Changi  and\r\n\r\nSeletar.  Nor a network of roads, probably  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  best maintained in South Asia, telephones  and\r\n\r\ntelecommunications that link us up with one another\r\n\r\nand  with  all the major cities of the  world,  and\r\n\r\nsoon a satellite receiving station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if Singapore were in the South Pacific,\r\n\r\npopulated   by   South-sea   Islanders   and    not\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  it  would not  be  able  to  feed  a\r\n\r\npopulation of even 20,000 people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not in the South Pacific, nor are we\r\n\r\nSouth-sea Islanders. We do not put flowers  on  our\r\n\r\nears,  either as decorative ornaments  or  as  fads\r\n\r\nlike the flower people in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These assets constitute our inheritance. We must\r\n\r\nmaintain  and improve upon what we have  inherited.\r\n\r\nBustling commercial and administrative centres have\r\n\r\nbeen known to sink into disrepair for lack of self-discipline,  often starting with the  leaders,  but\r\n\r\ninvariably infecting the whole population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a stable economic and political\r\n\r\nsituation.  We maintain sane, orderly  and  healthy\r\n\r\nconditions. There was a time not so very long  ago,\r\n\r\nparticularly in 1964 and 1965, after the riots when\r\n\r\ndiscipline  broke down, when it  looked  as  if  we\r\n\r\nmight slither down the slippery slope. Organisation\r\n\r\nand  administration became tangled  and  discipline\r\n\r\nslackened amongst our workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cows roamed the streets in the city, leaving dung\r\n\r\nall  over the place. Some people died driving their\r\n\r\ncars  into cows long before they could die  through\r\n\r\ndisease as a result of the filth. Stray dogs, sick,\r\n\r\nmangy and wild, were becoming a nuisance, a menace.\r\n\r\nWe had the laws changed and enforced. Cows found in\r\n\r\nthe  city  limits  provided food  for  our  welfare\r\n\r\nhomes.  Stray  dogs were eliminated as  efficiently\r\n\r\nand humanely as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall not just maintain standards of public\r\n\r\nhealth and cleanliness. We must go further and make\r\n\r\nthis the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncleanest  and greenest city in South  Asia.  If  we\r\n\r\nwant  high morale, we must have high standards.  If\r\n\r\nwe  want  high standards, the law must be  enforced\r\n\r\nfairly  and  firmly. There will be no squatters  or\r\n\r\nbeggars  sleeping  on  our  pavements  doing  their\r\n\r\nablutions in our drains. People will be housed  and\r\n\r\ncared  for.  Hawkers  will not  clog  up  the  main\r\n\r\nstreets.   There  will  be  thorough   and   proper\r\n\r\ncleansing every day of the year. Laws will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  passed to help rid us of the malpractices  that\r\n\r\nhave  crept into our work force. Only a year before\r\n\r\nlast,  malingering  and shirking  and  sabotage  to\r\n\r\ncreate overtime and treble, pay for public holidays\r\n\r\nwas  a way of life. Discipline and efficiency  must\r\n\r\nbe re-established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children will grow up in healthy and clean\r\n\r\nhomes,  with adequate ventilation, sunlight, water,\r\n\r\nelectricity and modern sanitation. Many will go  to\r\n\r\nkindergartens   even  before  they  begin   primary\r\n\r\neducation.  All  will have at least  six  years  of\r\n\r\nprimary   education  plus  another  two  years   of\r\n\r\nvocational  training. Of the total number  admitted\r\n\r\nto  Primary I every year, over 50 per cent go on to\r\n\r\ncomplete   four  years  of  academic  or  technical\r\n\r\nsecondary   education,  over  10  per  cent   reach\r\n\r\nUniversity entrance standards; over 5 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  best  go  on to University and other  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No other community in South Asia offers its\r\n\r\npeople   these  standards.  Nobody  believed   that\r\n\r\nSingapore   could  make  it,  except  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nNobody  believed that we had the gumption  and  the\r\n\r\nnous.  And we are proud of being Singaporeans.  And\r\n\r\nthat  pride and patriotism will grow over the years\r\n\r\nas  we  add to our inheritance: improved and higher\r\n\r\nefficiency   in   our   harbours   and    airports,\r\n\r\nmodernisation   in  containerised  facilities   and\r\n\r\nlanding  aids for longer runways to take the  jumbo\r\n\r\njets;  better  housing and more home ownership  for\r\n\r\nour  workers,  better schools,  clinics,  community\r\n\r\ncentres,  gardens,  libraries for  their  children;\r\n\r\nmore factories and better jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall build up our defence capacity. We should\r\n\r\nbe   able   to  make  arrangements  for  continuing\r\n\r\nsecurity in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconjunction  with  those  with  similar  interests.\r\n\r\nThere   are  possibilities  for  greater   economic\r\n\r\ngrowth. The sea offers limitless prospects, some of\r\n\r\nwhich we have already grasped in ship repairing and\r\n\r\nship-building.  They will grow  and  expand  as  we\r\n\r\ndevelop  our  skills  and  expertise,  and  as  our\r\n\r\nreputation spreads throughout the world.  We  shall\r\n\r\nbuild  and  run a merchant fleet. We shall  go  for\r\n\r\ndeep-sea  fishing  and eventually  save  about  $30\r\n\r\nmillion  we  spend every year in buying  fish  from\r\n\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economic growth will be accelerated if we\r\n\r\nprovide  ideal  conditions for the  siting  of  the\r\n\r\nheadquarters    of    international     industrial,\r\n\r\ncommercial and servicing enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the quickest way to reduce unemployment is\r\n\r\nthe  greater  inflow of tourists,  for  tourism  is\r\n\r\nlabour  intensive. With Singapore clean and  green,\r\n\r\nexotic  and  efficient,  with  good  and  courteous\r\n\r\nservice,  and shops filled with the good things  of\r\n\r\nlife,  the  tourists  will flow  in  from  America,\r\n\r\nJapan, Australia, New Zealand, and even Europe,  as\r\n\r\nthey  do  the  circuit Hongkong,  Angkor,  Bangkok,\r\n\r\nSingapore, Bali and beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two and a half years since separation,\r\n\r\nsome  35,000 people have moved from Malaya, or West\r\n\r\nMalaysia, to Singapore, as against some 6,000  from\r\n\r\nSingapore to Malaysia. If our economy had  stalled,\r\n\r\nthis  could  not have happened. Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  has  been  a great deal of  uninformed  talk\r\n\r\nabout  work permits. It is not, and has never been,\r\n\r\nour   intention  to  withdraw  work  permits   from\r\n\r\nprofessional,  skilled, or even  unskilled  workers\r\n\r\nwho do the hard jobs. These people help to increase\r\n\r\nour Gross National Product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 45,000 work permits, more or less evenly\r\n\r\ndivided  between  Malaysian  and  Indian  citizens,\r\n\r\nthere are about 6,500 permits for what we call  the\r\n\r\n\"easier  jobs\",  namely,  the  jobs  not  requiring\r\n\r\neither  special skills or much physical effort.  We\r\n\r\nneed  these  jobs for our own citizens  who,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  past education policies,  are  now  not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  training to become skilled  workers.\r\n\r\nThey include a large proportion of our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Malays.  They  have  in  the  past  been\r\n\r\neducated  in schools like Malay primary schools  or\r\n\r\nthe   Arabic  schools  without  being  taught   the\r\n\r\nsubjects  that are necessary to enable them  to  be\r\n\r\ntrained as artisans or technicians. But they can do\r\n\r\nthese easier jobs which are now being done by  non-citizens. Over the years, through the operation  of\r\n\r\nopen  market  forces, employers may  find  it  more\r\n\r\nattractive to employ our citizens for these  easier\r\n\r\njobs.  For  only  citizens are entitled  to  public\r\n\r\nhousing,  medical treatment, and health facilities,\r\n\r\nsocial  benefits  and so on.  If  we  keep  up  the\r\n\r\nmomentum, far from going down, in the next five  to\r\n\r\nten  years  we will not only provide jobs  for  our\r\n\r\nunemployed,  but  also  be  able  to  take   in   a\r\n\r\ncontrolled   flow   of   the   professionally   and\r\n\r\ntechnologically trained, the skilled and even those\r\n\r\nunskilled workers prepared to do the hard and heavy\r\n\r\njobs.  This  has  been the experience  of  all  the\r\n\r\ncountries  where, with higher education and  higher\r\n\r\nexpectations  of  their  own population,  immigrant\r\n\r\nlabour  was necessary to fill in the lower  echelon\r\n\r\nof  their  work force, whether it is in Japan  with\r\n\r\nFormosan  and  Korean workers or  in  Germany  with\r\n\r\nSpanish, Portuguese, Greek and Turkish workers,  or\r\n\r\nin  Britain with all the innumerable problems  that\r\n\r\nBritain  now faces as a result of this  process  of\r\n\r\ngoing  up  the social ladder. I do not  believe  we\r\n\r\nwill  face  any of these difficulties, because  the\r\n\r\npeople  we are allowing in are more or less already\r\n\r\nvery much like ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we shall have a prosperous, thriving and\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   Singapore.  And  nothing   is   more\r\n\r\ninfectious than success. In the longer run, it will\r\n\r\nbe  the light from Singapore that will radiate hope\r\n\r\nthroughout the region for similar success of  other\r\n\r\nmulti-racial communities not unlike us. By  example\r\n\r\nand   precept,  our  success  will  influence   the\r\n\r\nformulae  others  are  seeking  to  transform  old-fashioned  communities into modern,  industrialised\r\n\r\nand affluent societies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history is a long and unending process.\r\n\r\nHistory bears witness to the ascendancy of the more\r\n\r\nfit and the more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadaptable.

So the Roman Empire fell.  An  so\r\n\r\nsuccessive  Chinese  and Indian civilisations  were\r\n\r\nconquered  by  virile  warrior  races,   who   were\r\n\r\nsocially and culturally of a cruder order, and less\r\n\r\nsophisticated  in  their social  organisations.  We\r\n\r\nmust  be  on  our toes all the time.

But whatever happens in South  and\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia and in the wider world  beyond,  we\r\n\r\nmust  use  the  time given us to  grow  sturdy  and\r\n\r\nstrong.

We can be\r\n\r\ncounted amongst them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion*\r\n\r\nstanding in my name. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n* The motion reads as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the speech of the President be agreed to:-\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our thanks to the President\r\n\r\nfor the speech which he delivered on behalf ofthe Government at the opening of the First\r\n\r\nSession of this Parliament\".\r\n\r\n<hr size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nspeak  in support of the motion moved by the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  In  his speech, the President  described\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament as a \"Parliament  which  is  faced\r\n\r\nwith problems of more than usual magnitude\" and  he\r\n\r\nfinally   exhorted  hon.  Members  \"to   speak   in\r\n\r\nforthright  terms to reflect and more important  to\r\n\r\nlead  thinking and feeling in the country\". And  to\r\n\r\nleave  our Republic more flourishing and secure  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  this  Parliament. I am  positive  and\r\n\r\noptimistic that we all will give of our  best.  For\r\n\r\nthis   is  our  country.  The  people  have  almost\r\n\r\nunanimously voted for all the 58 candidates of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  of  whom  51  were returned  unopposed  on\r\n\r\nNomination Day, to make this Parliament a one-party\r\n\r\nParliament! This is not only unique in the  history\r\n\r\nof   parliamentary  democracy  at  work;  but  more\r\n\r\nimportant  still,  it manifests to  the  world  the\r\n\r\ndemonstration of absolute unity on the part of  the\r\n\r\npeople  in a multi-racial nation of two million  to\r\n\r\nbe  a people, to be a nation and to survive as  one\r\n\r\nas   long  as  time,  in  this  part  of  turbulent\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Addendum to the speech by the President\r\n\r\nand also the series of talks given by the Ministers\r\n\r\nclearly  portray the crucial years ahead  and  what\r\n\r\npositive  steps the Government will  be  taking  to\r\n\r\nresolve  them.  Also, what the people  and  country\r\n\r\nwill  have to face in the next five years or  more.\r\n\r\nWith  the  absence of an Opposition,  it  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean that this Parliament will not make\r\n\r\nany  contribution; in fact, it shall at the end  of\r\n\r\nits  life  leave  Singapore  more  flourishing  and\r\n\r\nsecure.  Since there are many hon. Members in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  who  will be making solid and constructive\r\n\r\ncomments on the President's Speech, I shall  on  my\r\n\r\npart  traverse a few topics and leave the rest  for\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  to deliberate. In this  respect,  I\r\n\r\nhope, Mr\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, you will allow me latitude and  bear\r\n\r\nwith  me  if  I  were to be a bit too specific  and\r\n\r\ndetailed  in  the  course  of  my  speech,  because\r\n\r\ndetails  are sometimes necessary to illustrate  and\r\n\r\nemphasise a point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is reassuring to note that a comprehensive\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill will be introduced and that some of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinances like the Labour Ordinance of  1955,\r\n\r\nthe  Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance  of  1957\r\n\r\nand the Clerks Employment Ordinance of 1957 will be\r\n\r\nrepealed.  In other words, the proposed  Bill  will\r\n\r\ncut across all sections of the `so many schemes  or\r\n\r\nagreements  of  employment and will  establish  one\r\n\r\nsingle  comprehensive form of employment  Ordinance\r\n\r\nthat will regulate and curtail employment benefits.\r\n\r\nInevitably,  more  employment  opportunities  would\r\n\r\nresult  to take in a good number of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, opportune and timely to introduce\r\n\r\nsuch a form of employment legislation, as Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  have to face and live up to the crucial years\r\n\r\nahead. The order of the day will be \"sacrifice  and\r\n\r\nmore sacrifice\" and every worker must put in a full\r\n\r\nday's  work  for a full day's wage. It  is  both  a\r\n\r\ncommendable  and  ambitious  scheme  and  can  only\r\n\r\nsucceed  when the people bravely live  up  to  `the\r\n\r\nchallenge. I am positive we will. However,  neither\r\n\r\nthe number of jobs to be created nor the percentage\r\n\r\nof the total unemployed to be reduced by this piece\r\n\r\nof  legislation is indicated in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech. I am of the opinion  that  the\r\n\r\ntrade   sector  will  be  unable  to  take   in   a\r\n\r\nconsiderable number, say, for example,  the  white-collar jobs. Admittedly this sector will not  be  a\r\n\r\ngood  job-provider.  This point  has  already  been\r\n\r\nexplained  by  the Finance Minister in  his  Budget\r\n\r\nStatement in the last Parliamentary Budget session.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if the introduction of the Bill were  to\r\n\r\nbring  about more job opportunities in  the  fields\r\n\r\nwhich I have mentioned earlier, then it might prove\r\n\r\ninadequate  to resolve the unemployment  situation.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think the Government is so naive as to\r\n\r\nintroduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  Bill to serve a particular purpose only. As  has\r\n\r\nbeen   briefly   described,  it  is  to   \"increase\r\n\r\nproductivity  and promote more industrial  growth\",\r\n\r\ntherefore  the  scope  would cover  a  wider  field\r\n\r\ndefinitely, and this must rightly be so. But  again\r\n\r\nthere  is  the question of how fast can  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth  be  generated or accelerated  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide   jobs   for  the  thousands   of   already\r\n\r\nunemployed  and, at the same time, for some  20,000\r\n\r\nsecondary  school-leavers who will be entering  the\r\n\r\nlabour  market  each  year.  Therefore,  industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth  must  take a new dimension  if  we  are  to\r\n\r\nreduce this staggering figure of the unemployed  to\r\n\r\na  manageable number. In other words,  this  figure\r\n\r\nmust  somehow be reduced through industrial  growth\r\n\r\nto manageable proportions so that social discontent\r\n\r\nand  instability may not result. I am  particularly\r\n\r\nhappy  to  see  that with the expanding  hotel  and\r\n\r\ncatering  industry, courses will  be  organised  to\r\n\r\ntrain  people  in  the know-how of this  particular\r\n\r\nindustry.  But again I would imagine  that  only  a\r\n\r\ncertain  number would benefit. I am  no  economist,\r\n\r\nand  I  do  not profess to be one either.  However,\r\n\r\nlooking at the ever-increasing number of unemployed\r\n\r\nin spite of the vigorous efforts the Government has\r\n\r\nconsistently put in, I would be credulous if I were\r\n\r\nto  believe that unemployment could be solved  that\r\n\r\neasily. This has been proved in countries which are\r\n\r\nboth more highly industrialised and well developed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given the right thinking and approach, I\r\n\r\nam  optimistic  that unemployment will  be  greatly\r\n\r\nreduced  if real sacrifices are made and  everybody\r\n\r\nplays  his  part  well. In  a  small  way,  if  the\r\n\r\nretirement  age is limited to 55 years  instead  of\r\n\r\nthe   present   60  years,  the  chances   of   job\r\n\r\nopportunities    would   increase,    though    not\r\n\r\nconsiderably. Bearing in mind that more  than  half\r\n\r\nour  population is below the age of 21, this  would\r\n\r\nhelp   ease,   to  some  extent,  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation  if  both the private and public  sectors\r\n\r\nretire  workers who reach the age of 55.  With  the\r\n\r\nyounger  workers replacing those retired, recurrent\r\n\r\nexpenditure by way of salaries and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  emoluments  would  be  reduced.  This  is  a\r\n\r\npossibility well worth looking into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Finance, over\r\n\r\nradio  and T.V, on 30th March this year, talked  on\r\n\r\n\"How to beat the slump\". He clearly elucidated that\r\n\r\nthe  gradual  withdrawal  of  the  British  defence\r\n\r\ncommitments  would  mean a  reduction  in  military\r\n\r\nexpenditure to the tune of $900 million between now\r\n\r\nand  1971.  He then went on to explain  in  general\r\n\r\ndetail how the Government proposes \"to prevent this\r\n\r\nrecession\".  And  in his subsequent  talk  on  16th\r\n\r\nApril on \"Economic Growth\", he laid emphasis on the\r\n\r\nincrease  of  economic growth through the  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade,  tourism,  shipping  and  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry.  These  two  talks  clearly  present  the\r\n\r\ncomplexity and magnitude of the crucial years ahead\r\n\r\nof  us.  As  I  have  pointed out,  Sir,  I  am  no\r\n\r\neconomist,  so  I  will turn to  the  next  heading\r\n\r\n\"Central Provident Fund\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the proposal to increase the range of\r\n\r\ncontributions towards the Central Provident Fund by\r\n\r\nincluding both those employed in the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  Statutory  Boards  as a necessary  measure  to\r\n\r\nmobilise domestic savings to be employed to counter\r\n\r\nrecession  strategy. This move is  both  sound  and\r\n\r\nwise.  Not  only will it bring about  an  equitable\r\n\r\nsharing of responsibility by both the employer  and\r\n\r\nthe  employee to make a must of compulsory  saving,\r\n\r\nbut in this case the Government is realistic enough\r\n\r\nto  realise that, by introducing such a move,  both\r\n\r\nthe Government and people will benefit directly and\r\n\r\nindirectly. Directly, it takes shape in the form of\r\n\r\ncompulsory  savings that will be reserved  for  the\r\n\r\nmember-contributor  until he reaches  retiring  age\r\n\r\nwhen  he  will  have at his disposal a considerable\r\n\r\nsum  that will continue to ensure him a more secure\r\n\r\nfuture   in   spending  his  years  of  retirement.\r\n\r\nObviously, he may turn to voluntary social  service\r\n\r\nto the Republic despite his retirement. This is the\r\n\r\ndirect benefit the employee, whether he is from the\r\n\r\nprivate sector or public service, will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget.  Indirectly, with the contributions, of  both\r\n\r\nthe  employee  and employer, the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund will be able to mobilise the use of such funds\r\n\r\nto  counter  the  recession  strategy  and  promote\r\n\r\nindustrial growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to suggest further\r\n\r\nthat with the introduction of such a proposal,  the\r\n\r\nquestion of payment of other forms of benefits.  In\r\n\r\nthe  public service, like gratuities, be abolished.\r\n\r\nIn  the field of public service, a civil servant on\r\n\r\ntop  of getting his pension also gets his gratuity,\r\n\r\nthe  amount of which will depend on the  number  of\r\n\r\nyears of service he has put in. And if he should be\r\n\r\nmade to contribute towards the C.P.F., then he will\r\n\r\nbenefit  in  three  ways for his services,  namely,\r\n\r\npension,  gratuity  and C.P.F, contributions.  This\r\n\r\nshould  not  be the case. Therefore, a scheme  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be  worked out whereby all those  already\r\n\r\nemplaced  in  permanent service may be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndraw  a  pension upon their retirement and made  to\r\n\r\ncontribute'   towards  the  C.P.F, up   to   their\r\n\r\nretirement age; maybe a smaller proportion  of  the\r\n\r\ngratuity  will  be  paid to  them;  also  those  on\r\n\r\nprobation will be made to contribute, say,  73  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  10  per  cent of their  salary  or  total\r\n\r\nemoluments  to  the C.P.F, and the  Government,  as\r\n\r\nemployer,  will  do likewise. Upon his  retirement,\r\n\r\nthe  employee will receive a lump sum instead,  and\r\n\r\nthis  will, of course, be bigger than the  gratuity\r\n\r\nthat   he  would  have  received  if  he  had   not\r\n\r\ncontributed   towards  the  C.P.F.  I   hope   this\r\n\r\nsuggestion will deserve consideration in  that  not\r\n\r\nonly will it help economic growth, but it will also\r\n\r\nenable  a  compulsory saving scheme to' materialise\r\n\r\nin which every employee is made to be a contributor\r\n\r\nto the C.P.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I now come to the problem in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  gap between \"the' haves and  the  have-nots\",  though considerably reduced, has as yet  to\r\n\r\nbe  bridged. In other words, the perspective, as  I\r\n\r\nlook  at,  is the provision of social amenities  in\r\n\r\nthe   rural  constituencies  like  Jalan  Kayu  and\r\n\r\nTampines, or Punggol for that matter. Although\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmuch   has  been  provided  for  them  by  way   of\r\n\r\nelectricity and water supplies and better roads and\r\n\r\ndrainage, I am of the opinion that a lot more  will\r\n\r\nhave to be done so that the facilities as such that\r\n\r\nare  being enjoyed by the urban population will  by\r\n\r\nthe  best possible means be also made available  to\r\n\r\nthe rural population. In this respect, I propose to\r\n\r\ndeal with the problem by items: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer first to electrification scheme. No doubt\r\n\r\na  good part of Punggol has been electrified; there\r\n\r\nare,  however,  certain  remote  areas  where   the\r\n\r\npopulation  is  sparse and for which such  supplies\r\n\r\nare  not  available.  As I  understand  it,  it  is\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the heavy costs that will have  to  be\r\n\r\nincurred that they are prevented from enjoying this\r\n\r\nfacility.  I  suppose that several million  dollars\r\n\r\nare  needed  to electrify these remote villages  or\r\n\r\nkampongs  in the various rural constituencies.  But\r\n\r\nif  I  may  ask,  what is several  million  dollars\r\n\r\ncompared to spending fifty million dollars to build\r\n\r\na  National Sports Stadium complex as Kallang where\r\n\r\nI am sure, Sir, not all the two million people will\r\n\r\nbenefit.   Therefore,  I  would  plead   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  do consider my point, as many  requests\r\n\r\nhave been made and some have yet to be acceeded to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to water supplies. I wish to make a\r\n\r\nsimilar  plea  on  supplies of  water.  A  national\r\n\r\nexercise  is  being carried out to remove  as  many\r\n\r\npublic  standpipes as possible. This, I understand,\r\n\r\nresulted from public wastage and indiscriminate use\r\n\r\nof  water and the Government has to pay as much  as\r\n\r\n$1.5  million to $2 million worth of water consumed\r\n\r\nat  these  standpipes  each year.  But  before  the\r\n\r\nstandpipes  are  removed, plans  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nprepared  for  the  laying of water  mains  to  the\r\n\r\nkampongs  and connection of water supplies  to  the\r\n\r\nhomes  will  have to be encouraged. Again,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nmust  emphasise that such supplies should  also  be\r\n\r\nmade   available  to  the  remotest  kampong.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  I have in my constituency several  remote\r\n\r\nkampongs which up till today have yet to have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  supplies,  let alone having a  stand-pipe  to\r\n\r\nshare.  Why  is  this  so? [Interruption]  That  is\r\n\r\nbecause the hon. Member's constituency is urban and\r\n\r\nhe  does not need standpipes. In my area it is much\r\n\r\nlarger;   probably   ten   Stamford   parliamentary\r\n\r\ndivisions  can  be  put into Punggol.  Sir,  it  is\r\n\r\nsimply  because laying a water main to these remote\r\n\r\nareas would entail high costs. Therefore, how  long\r\n\r\nhave these people to wait before they are given the\r\n\r\nsupplies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is indeed reassuring to note that\r\n\r\nwith   the   commissioning  of  the  Johore   River\r\n\r\nWaterworks  and  the commencement  of  the  Seletar\r\n\r\nProject,   water   supplies   will   be   immensely\r\n\r\nincreased. It is thus my hope that the rural  folks\r\n\r\nin  such  areas will not have to wait too long  and\r\n\r\nthat their needs will not be forgotten. I would  go\r\n\r\non to suggest that a scheme be drawn up with a view\r\n\r\nto  ensuring that water supplies be made  available\r\n\r\nto  the  remotest village or kampong in  any  rural\r\n\r\nconstituency,  probably  Choa  Chu  Kang,  as   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretary  to  the   Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance, was trying to catch my eye. Now that he is\r\n\r\non  the Government Bench, he finds it difficult  to\r\n\r\nbring  up such matters. This scheme or project  may\r\n\r\nnot  sound workable in view of the high costs,  but\r\n\r\nif it is carried out, it will close the gap between\r\n\r\nthe \"haves and the have-nots\" by a step closer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary production takes my attention next. It is\r\n\r\nalso  reassuring  to  note that  the  farmers  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be taken care of through the provision\r\n\r\nof  services and advice to enable them to  increase\r\n\r\ntheir farm products and reduce production costs. It\r\n\r\nappears  vague in the Addendum, Sir,  and  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  how  this is to be  done.  As  land\r\n\r\navailability is limited, intensive and  diversified\r\n\r\nfarming  becomes essential to sustain this part  of\r\n\r\nour   economy.  Maximum  utilisation  of  the  land\r\n\r\navailable  for farming activities to increase  farm\r\n\r\nproducts must result. The outmoded form of  farming\r\n\r\nmust give way to modern techniques. The building of\r\n\r\nmore  farm  schools  in  centrally-located  farming\r\n\r\nareas for the training and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nteaching   of   correct   farming   techniques   is\r\n\r\nessential.  Otherwise,  farming  as  a   means   of\r\n\r\nlivelihood   will  not  attract  those  handicapped\r\n\r\neducationally, so to speak, to take to farming. And\r\n\r\nin  that case the dependence on farm products  from\r\n\r\nthe  countries  outside the  Republic  will  become\r\n\r\ngreater.  Sir,  it is becoming more  apparent  that\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  land  which were  once  zoned  for\r\n\r\nagricultural  purposes are today fast disappearing,\r\n\r\nfor  many  an area has given way to other forms  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment. If such is the case, there will come a\r\n\r\ntime  when  farming will cease altogether.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthis  will  not come about and that every  possible\r\n\r\nstep  will  be  taken to preserve  such  lands  for\r\n\r\nfarming  activities, for their products  have  been\r\n\r\nhelping our national economy in no small measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the fisheries industry is being catered for\r\n\r\nand   that  considerable  efforts  are  being  made\r\n\r\ntowards  the  training  of  a  new  generation   of\r\n\r\nfishermen  both  off-shore  and  deep-sea   fishing\r\n\r\ndeserve  some comment. At present off-shore fishing\r\n\r\nis  carried  out  mainly by otter-trawlers  ranging\r\n\r\nfrom  five to 15 tons and manned by crews from five\r\n\r\nto  10  persons. Whilst noting that steps are being\r\n\r\ntaken  in  this  direction, I  find  again  in  the\r\n\r\nAddendum  no  safeguards  or  protection  for   our\r\n\r\ntrawlers; simply because marine patrols are lacking\r\n\r\nand  neighbouring  countries  have  extended  their\r\n\r\nterritorial   waters  from  three  to   12   miles.\r\n\r\nTherefore, some form of arrangement should be  made\r\n\r\nbetween  these countries to allow free  passage  of\r\n\r\nour   trawlers  in  their  fishing  pursuits,   not\r\n\r\nforgetting   that  Singapore  is  a   small   State\r\n\r\nsurrounded  by water and also surrounded  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  This is a \"fishy\" problem,  because  we\r\n\r\nhave neither a Navy nor adequate marine patrols  to\r\n\r\npatrol  satisfactorily  our territorial  waters  to\r\n\r\ngive the necessary protection for our trawlers  and\r\n\r\nfishermen when they go out to the open sea to  make\r\n\r\ntheir  living  and  to  make a  safe  return.  Hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  in  the last Parliament will remember  the\r\n\r\noccasions  when  it was brought  to  light  that  a\r\n\r\nnumber of our trawlers and fishermen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad  been apprehended or held to ransom by  pirates\r\n\r\njust  outside international waters. What then would\r\n\r\nbe  the safeguards and measures the Government will\r\n\r\ntake  to ensure our fishermen a free- from-hindrance\r\n\r\nfear when they take to sea? This is the crux of the\r\n\r\nproblem.   Providing   the  necessary   know   how,\r\n\r\ntechnique  and  training for a  new  generation  of\r\n\r\nfishermen  is  not so much of a problem;  the  real\r\n\r\nproblem lies in what I have just pointed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading \"Primary Production and Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural Services\", the second paragraph outlines\r\n\r\nthe  expansion  of  the  fishing  industry.  It  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  note  that a Fisheries  Wharf  and\r\n\r\nCentral  Fish Auction Market are being  constructed\r\n\r\nto  provide a system of fish landing, marketing and\r\n\r\ndistribution at Jurong. To date, Sir, I would  like\r\n\r\nto know of the number of deep-fishing companies set\r\n\r\nup and the total capital invested. Also, how are we\r\n\r\nto  make  full use of the facilities in  attracting\r\n\r\nlarger  fishing vessels to discharge their  catches\r\n\r\nhere?  In other words, what depth of study in  this\r\n\r\nparticular field has been made and what proportions\r\n\r\nwould  it  benefit  us? I am not being  pessimistic\r\n\r\nabout  the  project. As we are in  the  process  of\r\n\r\ntraining a new generation of fishermen for both off-shore  and  deep-sea fishing which  no  doubt  will\r\n\r\nultimately  help  in the economic growth,  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to have to depend largely on the import of\r\n\r\nfish and maybe fishing vessels from other countries\r\n\r\nto  discharge their catches at Jurong. If  this  is\r\n\r\nthe case, then we may envisage the need to build  a\r\n\r\nfish-canning factory near the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have mentioned the\r\n\r\nNational  Sports Stadium earlier, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nobtain  some  form  of  assurance  and  information\r\n\r\nregarding  this  complex.  I  understand  that  $50\r\n\r\nmillion will be needed to put up and complete  this\r\n\r\ncomplex. Once it is put up, I hope I can be ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> For a rugged society!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Once it is put up, I hope I can\r\n\r\nbe assured that it will not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nturn  out  to  be  a  \"white elephant\".  Also  what\r\n\r\ncontribution will this National Stadium make in the\r\n\r\nfield of sports? How often will it be used, and how\r\n\r\nwill  it help towards the building of a more robust\r\n\r\nand  rugged society, as has just been mentioned  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Changi? Therefore,  justification\r\n\r\nmust  be  made \"to get full value for every  dollar\r\n\r\nspent\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, Sir, now come to my last point. I refer to\r\n\r\nthe  last  paragraph  in  the  Addendum  sub-titled\r\n\r\n\"Family Planning\" under the Ministry of Health.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  it is a short paragraph but if one  were  to\r\n\r\nread  it carefully, one finds that \"family planning\r\n\r\nwill  be  prosecuted with greater vigour\".  I  have\r\n\r\nalready  expressed my views on this matter  when  I\r\n\r\ncommented on the Government's White Paper on family\r\n\r\nplanning and this is contained in the Hansard, Vol.\r\n\r\n24,  No.  4, dated 15th December, 1965, in  columns\r\n\r\n171  to  173.  I am astounded to know that  \"family\r\n\r\nplanning will be prosecuted with great vigour\"  and\r\n\r\nwill  be  \"augmented  by  the  .  .legislation   to\r\n\r\nlegalise  abortions and the voluntary sterilization\r\n\r\nof  persons\". I am not in favour of it and I  shall\r\n\r\nreserve my comments until the Bill is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I have earlier stated\r\n\r\nthat  I shall deal with only a few topics and leave\r\n\r\nthe rest to my colleagues, the Backbenchers. I have\r\n\r\nalso  pointed  out  at the beginning  of  my  short\r\n\r\nspeech  that we are one people, determined to  face\r\n\r\nthe  future in spite of the crucial years ahead and\r\n\r\nto  be  a  nation.  I  am confident  that  we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to survive, come what may.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the  workers of Singapore are fully aware  of\r\n\r\nthe crucial years that are coming ahead. There will\r\n\r\nbe a lot of problems to be solved. We are confident\r\n\r\nthat  the  workers  will  be  able  to  face  these\r\n\r\nproblems  and to co-operate with the employers  and\r\n\r\nthe  Government  to solve them. Everyone  is  aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  British Government will  be  withdrawing\r\n\r\ntheir military forces from the Singapore Base\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  end  of  1971, thereby causing  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunemployment.  About 30,000 of  the  workers  there\r\n\r\nwill   lose  their  jobs.  In  addition  to   that,\r\n\r\nthousands  of  our young school-leavers  are  still\r\n\r\nseeking  jobs.  In  other words,  the  unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem  will  be more acute and more  complicated,\r\n\r\nand  unless  the  workers, the  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment co-operate with each other, it  will  be\r\n\r\nvery difficult to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these difficulties and problems\r\n\r\nthat   are   coming   ahead,  the   Government   is\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  comprehensive Employment  Bill.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the  object of this Bill is to standardise\r\n\r\nand regulate the terms and conditions of employment\r\n\r\nof  all employees, to standardise working hours  of\r\n\r\n44  hours  per week for all employees, to  regulate\r\n\r\novertime   work,  to  enable  a  wider  spread   of\r\n\r\nemployment,  to limit certain fringe  benefits,  to\r\n\r\nlessen  abuses, increase productivity  and  promote\r\n\r\nmore  industrial growth. All these  objectives  are\r\n\r\nquite acceptable. What we hope, before the Bill  is\r\n\r\npassed,  is that representations from the  workers'\r\n\r\nside  will be seriously considered and accepted  so\r\n\r\nthat  no one side will be favoured. The workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  have,  during the past few  years,  been\r\n\r\nvery  co-operative with the Government.  Industrial\r\n\r\nrelationship between workers and employers has been\r\n\r\nvery  good  and  we are determined that  this  good\r\n\r\nindustrial relationship should carry on so that  it\r\n\r\nwill  be beneficial not only to the workers but  to\r\n\r\nthe employers as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we appreciate the importance of greater\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, higher productivity,  elimination\r\n\r\nof  restrictive  practices  and  abuses  of  fringe\r\n\r\nbenefits  and more efficient management.  We  agree\r\n\r\nthat,  in the national interest, the workers should\r\n\r\nsacrifice as much as possible. Also, we expect  the\r\n\r\nemployers to make sacrifices as well. The N.T.U.C.,\r\n\r\nat its last Annual Delegates' Conference on the 7th\r\n\r\nof April this year, unanimously passed a resolution\r\n\r\nto give our full co-operation to the Government. In\r\n\r\nother  words,  we are very sincere  and  we  openly\r\n\r\nagree to co-operate with the Government, especially\r\n\r\nwith the coming of this new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployment Bill. But we are surprised that at  this\r\n\r\nvery  moment  the employers' side is still  keeping\r\n\r\nvery  quiet. We hope they, the employers,  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to come out with a public statement that they\r\n\r\nwill  co-operate fully with the workers as well  as\r\n\r\nwith the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is a well-known fact that the abuse of\r\n\r\nfringe benefits, or whatever they may be, lies  not\r\n\r\nonly  on  the  side of the workers. Employers  also\r\n\r\nabuse the fringe benefits. In other words, not  all\r\n\r\nemployers  are  saints  and  not  all  workers  are\r\n\r\nangels.  Just  because  of a  small  percentage  of\r\n\r\nworkers who deliberately abuse the fringe benefits,\r\n\r\nI  hope this new Employment Bill will not be  taken\r\n\r\nas a punishment to the rest of the good workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that the increase in working\r\n\r\nhours  to  a standard 44 hours per week, will  help\r\n\r\nemployers  increase productivity and  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  enable  them to engage more workers.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat, with the workers agreeing to the increase  in\r\n\r\nworking hours, employers will not take advantage by\r\n\r\nretrenching  employees, because in  every  company,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  limited number of  workers  and  some\r\n\r\nemployers may take advantage of the new situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to increase in productivity, it is\r\n\r\nnot  merely  a question of increasing  the  working\r\n\r\nhours. There are other necessary factors to achieve\r\n\r\nincreased productivity. For example, there must  be\r\n\r\ngood industrial relationship between employers  and\r\n\r\nemployees, good wages and conditions of employment,\r\n\r\ngood    management,   personnel    and    efficient\r\n\r\nsupervisors.  One  of  the  best  ways  to  achieve\r\n\r\nincreased   productivity   is   to   give   certain\r\n\r\nincentives to workers, like incentive bonuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years of the N.T.U.C, leadership,\r\n\r\nindustrial   relationship   between   workers   and\r\n\r\nemployers  has  been  very  good.  There  are  more\r\n\r\nenlightened,  intelligent  and  responsible   trade\r\n\r\nunion  leaders  who  are able to settle  industrial\r\n\r\ndisputes   and   negotiate  for   good   collective\r\n\r\nagreements by knowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  of  the employers to  pay.  The  old\r\n\r\ntechniques of slogan-shouting and wild-cat  strikes\r\n\r\nare   now   out  of  date  and  not  practised   by\r\n\r\nenlightened trade union leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers fully support regulation of overtime\r\n\r\nbecause it is not good for some workers to score so\r\n\r\nmuch  in over-time while there are many people  who\r\n\r\nare  unemployed.  So  I  sincerely  hope  that   by\r\n\r\nregulating  overtime, employers  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nengage  more  workers so that there  will  be  less\r\n\r\npeople unemployed in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a scheme to train workers in all the\r\n\r\nservices  in view of the withdrawal of the  British\r\n\r\nmilitary  forces. I hope that this kind of training\r\n\r\ncan  be extended to a selected number of unemployed\r\n\r\npeople,  because a good number of  them  are  still\r\n\r\nunable  to  get jobs, although they have registered\r\n\r\ntheir  names in the Labour Exchange for  years.  In\r\n\r\ngiving   them   a  chance  to  join  the   training\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  a  person registered as  a  clerk  may\r\n\r\nperhaps  be able to be trained as a technician  and\r\n\r\nget a job as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the question of fringe benefits.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years, union leaders have struggled\r\n\r\nfor and managed to get whatever fringe benefits  we\r\n\r\nnow  have.  With  the coming of the new  Employment\r\n\r\nBill,  we  hope  that  there is  a  possibility  of\r\n\r\nleaving  as they are whatever agreements there  are\r\n\r\nbetween employers and employees if there is  mutual\r\n\r\nagreement  on both sides. It is painful that  after\r\n\r\nstruggling  for so many years we have to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nmany of the fringe benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that it is most welcome to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Government  intends  to  encourage\r\n\r\nworkers  to  own their own homes. In  view  of  the\r\n\r\nincrease  in contributions to the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund,  I hope that most of the workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill take this opportunity to own their own homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have been told by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  that  we have to establish  a  very  good\r\n\r\nindustrial climate in Singapore to attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to establish their business here so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore people will get jobs and our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  will be more successful. Of course,  the\r\n\r\nnew  Employment Bill will be passed in  due  course\r\n\r\nsubject to discussions between employers, employees\r\n\r\nand the Government, and after hearing the views and\r\n\r\nrecommendations of all parties concerned. With  the\r\n\r\npassing  of the new Employment Bill, we  hope  that\r\n\r\nmore  foreign investors will come here  and  engage\r\n\r\nworkers   in  Singapore.  I  think  it   is   known\r\n\r\nthroughout  the world that Singapore  is  the  best\r\n\r\nplace   for   investment  due  to  its   good   and\r\n\r\nincorruptible  government. There is  political  and\r\n\r\neconomic  stability.  There  are  intelligent   and\r\n\r\nsensible  trade union leaders. There are facilities\r\n\r\navailable,  such  as shipping, banking,  insurance,\r\n\r\ncommunications, etc. Such facilities, to a  certain\r\n\r\nextent,   will   attract   foreign   investors   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to conclude by\r\n\r\ngiving  the assurance that the workers in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  fully co-operate with the employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   build  a  happy  and   prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore. The people of Singapore have  the  will,\r\n\r\ndetermination and capacity to succeed in  spite  of\r\n\r\nwhatever  difficulties that may arise.

The Prime Minister  and,\r\n\r\nindeed, several other Ministers have spoken of  the\r\n\r\ncrucial years ahead and that they cannot afford  to\r\n\r\nbe naive nor ingenuous. The President in his speech\r\n\r\nlaid  emphasis  on three important points,  namely,\r\n\r\nnational  defence,  economic  growth  and  national\r\n\r\nconsciousness. In respect of the second point, that\r\n\r\nis,  economic growth, both the Minister for Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology  and the Minister  for  Finance  in\r\n\r\ntheir   recent  speeches  stressed  the  need   for\r\n\r\nmanagerial and technological advance in industry. I\r\n\r\nagree  wholeheartedly with them. If these  advances\r\n\r\nare  to  be fostered, it follows logically that  we\r\n\r\nshould  harness the natural talents of  our  youths\r\n\r\nand  provide  them with the necessary  training  to\r\n\r\nbecome    scientists,   engineers,   managers    or\r\n\r\ntechnologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to draw the attention of\r\n\r\nthis  House  to the large sums of Government  money\r\n\r\nbeing  spent on the training of medical  personnel.\r\n\r\nIt  is  generally known that, because of the status\r\n\r\nsymbol of doctors and because of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe lucrative income of the medical profession, the\r\n\r\nMedical Faculty of the University of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nattracted  and  is continuing to  attract  the  top\r\n\r\nlayer  of  the  cream of our H.S.C, graduates.  The\r\n\r\nMedical Faculty takes in about 70 to 80 of our best\r\n\r\nH.S.C, graduates every year and we are spending  on\r\n\r\neach  student  about $7,000 each year.  This  means\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  investing  about  $42,000  in  every\r\n\r\nmedical  student if he graduates within six  years.\r\n\r\nWhile  I  hold a good doctor in the highest  esteem\r\n\r\nand  while  I  agree that we need good  doctors  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  our high standard of health, I wonder  if\r\n\r\nsome  of  this  top  talent  could  not  be  better\r\n\r\nutilised  in ship-building, engineering  and  other\r\n\r\nindustries of top priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unemployment is an urgent and\r\n\r\nserious  problem that is constantly  troubling  our\r\n\r\nminds.  Even before the British decided to withdraw\r\n\r\ntheir  forces, we had tens of thousands of  school-leavers joining the unemployment ranks every  year.\r\n\r\nNow  with  the impending withdrawal of the  British\r\n\r\nForces  from  Singapore, this problem  will  become\r\n\r\neven more acute. In this respect, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nScience and Technology has said that education must\r\n\r\nnow be regarded as a means towards increasing one's\r\n\r\nusefulness  in society and as a means of  obtaining\r\n\r\nrewarding  and satisfying employment. He  has  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that  emphasis should move  from  the  white-collar  to  the blue-collar jobs. I agree  entirely\r\n\r\nwith him. But I would like to know how and when  he\r\n\r\nis   going   to  implement  this  change.   Is   he\r\n\r\nconsidering  changes  in the many  adult  education\r\n\r\nclasses  which  are preparing students  for  repeat\r\n\r\nattempts  in the School Certificate and the  H.S.C.\r\n\r\nexaminations?   These  classes  are,   in   effect,\r\n\r\nproducing more white-collar workers while the  need\r\n\r\nis  to  produce blue-collar workers. Many of  these\r\n\r\nclasses  are  being conducted by teachers  who  are\r\n\r\nalready  engaged  in  day schools,  thus  providing\r\n\r\nearning  opportunities to those who are already  in\r\n\r\nemployment, whi1st the number of unemployed persons\r\n\r\nis increasing by leaps and bounds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nevery  year. Besides that, the employment of  full-time  day  teachers  in the adult  education  night\r\n\r\nclasses  deprives  younger  children  in  the   day\r\n\r\nschools  of  effective teaching, for full-time  day\r\n\r\nteaching followed by extramural activities and then\r\n\r\nfollowed  by  night  teaching  hardly  leaves   the\r\n\r\nteacher  any time to prepare his lessons  properly.\r\n\r\nFurther,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister, in his efforts to resolve the\r\n\r\nunemployment problem, is considering the withdrawal\r\n\r\nof married women from employment. If so, perhaps he\r\n\r\nshould  spare  married women in  the  lower  income\r\n\r\nbracket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to turn to the Finance Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech  on 30th of March, 1968, wherein he  gave  a\r\n\r\nclear analysis of how he intended to counteract the\r\n\r\nrecession  created by the impending  withdrawal  of\r\n\r\nthe  British Forces. I must congratulate him on his\r\n\r\nvery   careful  and  exact  conclusions.   However,\r\n\r\nalthough  he  was  aware of the  magnitude  of  the\r\n\r\nimport  leakage,  he did not elaborate  on  how  he\r\n\r\ncould keep this to the barest minimum. Obviously he\r\n\r\nwas  mindful of the need to encourage  the  use  of\r\n\r\nlocal products in place of imported goods. Although\r\n\r\nit is often said that the Singapore consumer market\r\n\r\nis  small, yet the Minister disclosed that about 60\r\n\r\nper  cent of consumer expenditure leaves for places\r\n\r\nabroad.  That  is, it is spent on  imported  goods.\r\n\r\nThis   means  that,  despite  spectacular   capital\r\n\r\ninvestment in industry, ranging from $20 million in\r\n\r\n1961  to $404 million in 1967, only 40 per cent  of\r\n\r\nconsumer   expenditure  has  been   captured.   It,\r\n\r\ntherefore, seems that there is still plenty of room\r\n\r\nfor  industrial expansion in consumer goods  alone.\r\n\r\nBut  in  order  that locally-manufactured  consumer\r\n\r\ngoods can capture the local market, it is necessary\r\n\r\nthat  our  local manufacturers should convince  the\r\n\r\npublic  that their goods are comparable in  quality\r\n\r\nto imported goods and that they are cheaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress that whereas\r\n\r\nthe  encouragement of local industry will  conserve\r\n\r\nforeign   exchange  and  create   more   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities, it is essential that prices be kept\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas   low  as  possible.  The  profit  margins  of\r\n\r\nindustrialists  should be closely examined  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister.  I am aware that investors in  industries\r\n\r\nexpect the best returns from their investments, but\r\n\r\nunless  their profit margins are kept to reasonable\r\n\r\nproportions, the cost of living will go up and  all\r\n\r\nour  efforts in encouraging local industries  would\r\n\r\nseem to benefit only the factory owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance on 16th April, 1968,\r\n\r\ndisclosed  his plans to develop economic growth  in\r\n\r\nfour  main  fields,  namely,  the  entrepot  trade,\r\n\r\ntourism, shipping and the manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\nHis  study of the tourist trade is most commendable\r\n\r\nand  I  wish  him every success in his  attempt  to\r\n\r\nestablish Singapore in the Pacific tourist circuit.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, there are two types of  tourists\r\n\r\ncoming  into  Singapore. One type is  the  American\r\n\r\nsoldier from the Vietnam war theatre. He comes here\r\n\r\nto rest. For him a comfortable hotel, good food and\r\n\r\ngood  recreational facilities would be all that  he\r\n\r\nwould  ask  for.  The  other type  is  the  average\r\n\r\ntourist who comes here for sight-seeing. I am aware\r\n\r\nthat  the  Tourist Promotion Board has a  fleet  of\r\n\r\nsight-seeing  buses to take tourists  on  conducted\r\n\r\ntours.  But  I would like to know if the advantages\r\n\r\nof  our multi-racial and multi-cultural society and\r\n\r\nour natural vegetation, such as rubber plantations,\r\n\r\npineapple plantations and coconut plantations, have\r\n\r\nbeen fully exploited and developed for sight-seeing\r\n\r\nto  attract  foreign  tourists.  Promoting  tourism\r\n\r\nabroad  is of no use, if, when a tourist  comes  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, he finds nothing to see. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nTourist  Promotion  Board should concentrate  their\r\n\r\nefforts on promoting more attractive facilities  on\r\n\r\nour island for the tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister will take my remarks in good spirit, for I\r\n\r\nwas  indeed prompted by the Prime Minister  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech here on Monday to speak my mind. May I  once\r\n\r\nagain  endorse the Prime Minister's thanks  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident for his speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nmay  I  express my warm support basically  for  the\r\n\r\nmeasures that this Government will implement in the\r\n\r\ncrucial years ahead, as outlined in the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech,  in  the  addendum to  the  speech  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident,   and  in  the  Ministerial   broadcasts\r\n\r\nentitled, indeed, \"The Crucial Years\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also, however, enter some observations on\r\n\r\nportions  of the documents referred to,  respectful\r\n\r\nas  I  hope  I am of the President's injunction  to\r\n\r\nspeak  in  forthright terms. It is likely  that  my\r\n\r\ncomments   will  focus  themselves  on   particular\r\n\r\ndetails  of implementation of Government's measures\r\n\r\nin  respect of one or two Ministries, details which\r\n\r\nmay   have  already  suggested  themselves  to  the\r\n\r\nofficers of the Ministry concerned or the Ministers\r\n\r\nthemselves;  but I feel that certain problems  must\r\n\r\nbe  underlined  so  that the fullest  attention  is\r\n\r\ngiven to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note, and I note with feelings of\r\n\r\ncongratulation,  that  in  education  one  of   the\r\n\r\ntargets  of  Government's  attention  will   be   a\r\n\r\nreorganisation  of the secondary school  system  to\r\n\r\ndivert   a  much  larger  number  of  students   to\r\n\r\ntechnical education and vocational training. It  is\r\n\r\nhoped  that the selection of candidates, especially\r\n\r\nfor vocational training, will be on the basis of  a\r\n\r\nscientific assessment of their potential  for  this\r\n\r\ntype  of  development. I make  this  point  because\r\n\r\ncustomary  attitudes in the past have  resulted  in\r\n\r\ndrop-outs   from   the  academic   stream   finding\r\n\r\nthemselves  saddled with vocational training  as  a\r\n\r\nrather  poor  and second choice. Such  outcome  has\r\n\r\nbeen  somehow or other based on the dimly-conceived\r\n\r\nassumption  that  if one is no good  for  a  white-collar  occupation, then why not give training  (or\r\n\r\nso-called  training)  for  a  blue-collar   job   a\r\n\r\ndesperate bash?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the country needs in the field\r\n\r\nof  vocational training, as much as in the field of\r\n\r\ntechnical education, the optimum potential that  it\r\n\r\ncan  recruit,  not  pupils  who  will  enter  their\r\n\r\ntraining tasks with a consciousness of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  having  failed  in  some  other  educational\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want our factories and industrial workshops\r\n\r\nmanned  by  people assured of their capacities  and\r\n\r\nconfident of their skills - not by people  who  are\r\n\r\napologetic  about their academic short-comings.  It\r\n\r\nis  hoped,  also, that the type of  training  given\r\n\r\nwill   be   sufficiently  flexible  to  allow   our\r\n\r\ntechnical  workers and technicians to be  adaptable\r\n\r\nto  quite certain scientific changes in the future.\r\n\r\nConfident  as  I am of the far-sightedness  of  our\r\n\r\nGovernment,  I am sure also that the creative  side\r\n\r\nof the development of our workers will also be seen\r\n\r\nto.  So  that  not only do we adapt technically  to\r\n\r\nchanges  imposed on us somewhat from  the  outside,\r\n\r\nbut   that   we   may  initiate  these  adaptations\r\n\r\nourselves for our own benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I express my view that the new direction of\r\n\r\nemphasis  in  our  educational  policy  (from   the\r\n\r\nacademic to the technical-vocational) will  achieve\r\n\r\nthe  highly  desirable result of  largely  removing\r\n\r\nfrom  our educational system the unpleasant feature\r\n\r\nof  many  pupils  being,  in  the  final  analysis,\r\n\r\ncoached   for   failure   in   examinations.    The\r\n\r\ndiversification of our educational system  will,  I\r\n\r\nhope,  provide  opportunity for pupils  of  varying\r\n\r\naptitudes  to develop those capabilities which  can\r\n\r\nbe  best  developed  to  the  satisfaction  of  the\r\n\r\nindividual and the welfare of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, it should also be hoped that\r\n\r\nthere  will be such qualitative improvement of  our\r\n\r\nexaminations   system  as  will   not   result   in\r\n\r\nexaminations being the principal, if neurotic, goal\r\n\r\nof classroom endeavour. I remember reading a speech\r\n\r\nseveral months ago by one of our Ministers who gave\r\n\r\nit  as  his  opinion that certain subjects  in  the\r\n\r\ncurriculum   could   well  be  removed   from   the\r\n\r\ncompelling grip of the examination syndrome. In  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  this is a most fruitful line of thinking.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  we  could further exercise better  control\r\n\r\nover  the effects of our examinations policy if  we\r\n\r\nconducted all our examinations ourselves,  whenever\r\n\r\nwe have, at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall, to conduct examinations. If we were to apply a\r\n\r\ncost-benefit  analysis to the  suggestion  that  we\r\n\r\nhave our own school-leaving examinations system  in\r\n\r\nthe  English  stream, and if we were  to  take  all\r\n\r\nfactors  into  consideration (and  not  only  those\r\n\r\nparticularistic  factors  pertaining  to  immediate\r\n\r\nfinancial     expenditure    and     administrative\r\n\r\nconvenience),  we  might find our own  examinations\r\n\r\nsystem a more economic and educationally productive\r\n\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of bilingualism in\r\n\r\nschools,  I endorse the principle outlined  in  the\r\n\r\nrelevant  sections under the heading  \"Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation\",  of the Addendum to the Speech  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident. I must emphasize, however, my view  that\r\n\r\nknowledge  of  the principal medium of  instruction\r\n\r\nmust  be  carried  to  the  highest  standards   of\r\n\r\nsophistication possible and desirable  in  relation\r\n\r\nto   the  appropriate  levels  of  schooling.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  Sir, one of the reasons why many  of  our\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated youths are so hazardously  exposed\r\n\r\nto  the fads and blandishments of the mass-media in\r\n\r\nEnglish  is  that their command of English  permits\r\n\r\nthem  only  to  respond to base  appeals  in  basic\r\n\r\nEnglish.  Many  of  such youths  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nassimilate  superior cultural  notions  that  could\r\n\r\ncome  through  the  English medium  simply  because\r\n\r\ntheir  ability  to  use this  medium  is  just  not\r\n\r\nadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of quality at all levels of\r\n\r\neducation,  may I suggest that every  encouragement\r\n\r\nbe  given  to  the  setting up  of  an  educational\r\n\r\nresearch  organisation which,  while  it  is  in  a\r\n\r\nresponsible  way  sensitive to  the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\neducational  situation, should  be  independent  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  control by civil  servants  in  the\r\n\r\neducation sector. May I hasten to add that I  have,\r\n\r\nin  general, a profound regard for the professional\r\n\r\ncompetence  of  our  educationists  who  are   also\r\n\r\nadministrative civil servants. And their  expertise\r\n\r\nand   experience  would  be  valuable  in  research\r\n\r\nprojects.  But  their  resources  should  be   made\r\n\r\navailable  for  research purposes in  an  undivided\r\n\r\nfashion,  and  they should not be  exposed  to  the\r\n\r\npossibility \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof bureaucratic considerations affecting the\r\n\r\ndirection of their research recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be feasible for our institutions of\r\n\r\ntertiary   education  and  the  Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege  to  be  jointly involved in this  research\r\n\r\nenterprise,  by way of an Institute for Educational\r\n\r\nResearch, to which could be seconded officers  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education and Ministry of  Science\r\n\r\nand Technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Cabinet Committee will now exercise supervision\r\n\r\nover  crucial  aspects  of  our  education  policy.\r\n\r\nWhatever  the planning that is worked out,  I  must\r\n\r\nsay,  even at the risk of appearing trite, that  it\r\n\r\nis  basically the teachers in our schools who  will\r\n\r\nbe  the  human operatives on whose performance  and\r\n\r\ncontribution will depend the success of  the  plan.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I wish to stress that I want  to\r\n\r\nexpress  myself  as cautiously as possible,  but  I\r\n\r\nmust  say  that it is my belief that not enough  of\r\n\r\nthe  potential enthusiasm and zeal of teachers have\r\n\r\nbeen  released towards the vigorous improvement  of\r\n\r\nour educational system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When plans are laid, not enough of the opinion of\r\n\r\nthe  rank  and file has been solicited.  There  are\r\n\r\nscarcely  any  devices  or procedures  whereby  the\r\n\r\nfeelings and views of those who are going  to  work\r\n\r\nthe   educational   system  are   sought.   Without\r\n\r\ndiscussion   there   cannot  be   that   full   and\r\n\r\nwholehearted  commitment, that  understanding  zeal\r\n\r\nthat  is  necessary  to galvanise  our  educational\r\n\r\nsystem  into ever-ready responses to the  needs  of\r\n\r\nour  society. Whenever decisions are made, whenever\r\n\r\nplans  are  laid,  we  need more  than  a  resigned\r\n\r\nacquiescence to these decisions and plans. We  need\r\n\r\nthe  participation of our teachers in the  thinking\r\n\r\nout of our problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last few years I have had occasion to\r\n\r\nreceive   feedbacks  about  the  quality   of   our\r\n\r\nteachers.  I  must  say that  where  those  of  our\r\n\r\nteachers  are  concerned who  have  finished  their\r\n\r\ntraining  and  have  had experience  enough  to  be\r\n\r\nmatured in the process of exposure to the joys  and\r\n\r\ntribulations  of  teaching, they  are  adequate  in\r\n\r\ntheir knowledge,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompetent  in  their practice (where  circumstances\r\n\r\nallow  scope  for  pedagogical  application),   and\r\n\r\npotentially   alert   to   the   possibilities   of\r\n\r\nimprovement.   In  other  words,  our   experienced\r\n\r\nteachers   would  compare  favourably  with   their\r\n\r\ncounterparts in other societies which have  a  more\r\n\r\nsophisticated educational set-up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have achieved remarkable progress in the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  educational  opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\nchildren.   This   is   a   matter   for   profound\r\n\r\ncongratulation. I am sincere and I do not  wish  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken as being condescending in this matter. In\r\n\r\nquantitative  terms the target has  been  achieved,\r\n\r\nbut  in  all  the tremendous drive to achieve  this\r\n\r\nphysical   triumph,  have  we  jettisoned   certain\r\n\r\nimportant  psychological considerations  pertaining\r\n\r\nto the need of teachers to feel that they are given\r\n\r\nadequate   recognition  of  their   role   in   the\r\n\r\neducational  progress  of  our  society?   Do   our\r\n\r\nteachers feel mere cogs in the educational  machine\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  grinding out  more  schools,  more\r\n\r\nlaboratories,  more equipment, more students  even?\r\n\r\nAre  they  just being fed and perhaps fed  up  with\r\n\r\ndirectives  and  expected  to  respond   to   these\r\n\r\nimpersonal instructions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that in the near future we may\r\n\r\nwant  to  make further demands on our teachers,  in\r\n\r\nthe  national interest. Let our planners enter into\r\n\r\na  dialogue  with those who are going to  implement\r\n\r\nplans.  When  an  idea,  for example,  strikes  our\r\n\r\nplanners   that  senior  members  of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nprofession  require civic or political orientation,\r\n\r\ndo  not let these teachers be gathered indoors  and\r\n\r\nlectured to for hours with little respite, and with\r\n\r\neven  less  respect  for the  fact  that  they  are\r\n\r\nteachers  who  have  been taught  to  make  lessons\r\n\r\ninteresting and pupil-centred - and here  they  are\r\n\r\nin a situation where scant consideration is paid to\r\n\r\nbasic canons of teaching practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we wish to change attitudes, then we must have\r\n\r\ndiscussion. Exhortation, purely and simply as such,\r\n\r\nis  going out of fashion even from the pulpit. Over\r\n\r\nthe  past two or three decades especially,  studies\r\n\r\nin social psychology have very plausibly and, to my\r\n\r\nmind, quite conclusively indicated that when people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparticipate in discussion, they are more  ready  to\r\n\r\nchange  their behaviour when they move out of  this\r\n\r\ndiscussion   context  than  when  the  channel   of\r\n\r\ncommunication  has been a one-way process.  Because\r\n\r\nalso  in  a  discussion context,  people  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  their human  worth  to  be  given\r\n\r\nrecognition.  Therefore,  I  say,   Sir,   let   us\r\n\r\nstructure devices and generate the mood and  style,\r\n\r\nas   a  result  of  which  our  teachers  can  have\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  discussion among themselves,  and\r\n\r\ntransmit  thoughtful proposals to  our  educational\r\n\r\nplanners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already mentioned what I consider to be\r\n\r\nthe   necessity  for  an  independent   educational\r\n\r\nresearch institute. It may be possible for there to\r\n\r\nbe   attached  to  this  institute  an  educational\r\n\r\nliaison  council which would be responsible,  on  a\r\n\r\ncontinuing  basis for the reception and  processing\r\n\r\nof   memoranda,  which  could  ultimately  indicate\r\n\r\nfruitful   lines   of  practical   and   productive\r\n\r\neducational investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wish all our citizens to be habituated to the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  procedures  of  thoughtful  discussion,\r\n\r\nwherein  respect  for  the opinions  and  potential\r\n\r\ncontribution   of  others  may  be  a   significant\r\n\r\nfeature. Why not act with our teachers who are  key\r\n\r\npeople  in the inculcation of healthy attitudes  in\r\n\r\nour children?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, measures should be taken to see\r\n\r\nthat  in  the classroom our pupils are  not  simply\r\n\r\nbeing  made  recipients of information  from  their\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of education, perhaps not given\r\n\r\nsufficient  consideration  in  the  past,  is   the\r\n\r\nnecessity to get our children to ask questions, and\r\n\r\nnot  simply lap up devotedly what the teacher  says\r\n\r\nas   the   last  oracular  word.  That   discussion\r\n\r\ntechniques  seem  to  be notable  rather  by  their\r\n\r\nabsence from the educational scene has been brought\r\n\r\nhome  to  me  with some force on several occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen  discussion  time comes up,  for  example,  in\r\n\r\nadult  education classes, there is  a  vast  sticky\r\n\r\nsilence.  On  one occasion when I had a  chat  with\r\n\r\nsome senior teachers and I suggested to them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   perhaps   they   could   institute   certain\r\n\r\ndiscussion  procedures  in their  classrooms,  they\r\n\r\nagreed that it would be a good idea, but said  that\r\n\r\nthe  cultural  shock to their pupils  would  be  so\r\n\r\ngreat  that they would not know how to handle their\r\n\r\nclasses after that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now, Mr Speaker, carry the point I am\r\n\r\nmaking   about   the   necessity   for   discussion\r\n\r\nopportunities  a little further. I have  said  that\r\n\r\nour  teachers need discussion opportunities and our\r\n\r\npupils  need discussion opportunities. I would  say\r\n\r\nthat our citizens need discussion situations to  be\r\n\r\nstructured for them. We read in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech, under the heading \"Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture\":\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To get our people better prepared and to\r\n\r\nparticipate  more  in the immense  national  effort\r\n\r\nrequired in the crucial years ahead, the mass media\r\n\r\nof  Radio,  Television  and  publications  will  be\r\n\r\nimproved and expanded.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is intended that our mass media \"will not  only\r\n\r\ninform,   entertain  and  educate  but  will   also\r\n\r\nstimulate patriotism, public-spiritedness  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance of increased productivity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I suggest that an important ancillary to\r\n\r\npropaganda  through the mass media  -  and  I  must\r\n\r\nstress that I am using the term \"propaganda\" in its\r\n\r\nneutral  sense, without any pejorative implications\r\n\r\n-  is adult education. In conjunction with the mass\r\n\r\nmedia,  listening  and  viewing  groups  could   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  in  our  community  centres,   in   the\r\n\r\npremises of voluntary organisations, in schools  in\r\n\r\nrespect of teacher-parent gatherings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other aspects of systematic public education\r\n\r\ncould  also  be encouraged. Sir, we are inculcating\r\n\r\nin  our  children in schools various attitudes  and\r\n\r\nmores  which we feel will help our national effort.\r\n\r\nAt  the  same time, many children get little social\r\n\r\nreinforcement of these attitudes in  the  home.  We\r\n\r\nwant  our  children  to exercise  wisdom  in  their\r\n\r\nvocational  choice.  Yet parents  with  traditional\r\n\r\nviews    may   insist   on   their   own   outmoded\r\n\r\npredilections. I hope the following may not be  too\r\n\r\ntrivial  an  anecdote  for  the  House,  but  in  a\r\n\r\nconversation with a school's dental officer, I  was\r\n\r\ntold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  while our dentists are teaching our  children\r\n\r\nhealthy  care of their teeth, some parents  do  not\r\n\r\nprovide    their   children   with   tooth-brushes.\r\n\r\n[Laughter]. I am not intending to strike a note  of\r\n\r\nlevity, Mr Speaker, Sir, because I notice that  in\r\n\r\nthe  section  devoted  to  \"Health\",  there  is   a\r\n\r\nparagraph  referring to dental  care.  This  little\r\n\r\nanecdote which I related just now has some  bearing\r\n\r\non what we intend to do. While we urge our children\r\n\r\nto  help  to  make our city beautiful,  these  same\r\n\r\nchildren  may be living in circumstances which  are\r\n\r\nfar from being aesthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is highly desirable, to my mind, that\r\n\r\ncontinuing educational opportunity be afforded  the\r\n\r\nparents  of  our  children so that any  discordance\r\n\r\nbetween home and school may be eliminated; not only\r\n\r\nthis,  but  that indeed an understanding of  public\r\n\r\nissues may be generated. In order to achieve  this,\r\n\r\nmore  devices must be resorted to, besides the mass\r\n\r\nmedia.  I would like to enter a mild caveat against\r\n\r\nexaggerating the effectiveness of the mass media as\r\n\r\na   means  of  communicating  a  specific  message,\r\n\r\nespecially in the circumstances of a free and  open\r\n\r\nsociety like ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any teacher will be able to say that at any\r\n\r\njuncture of a teaching activity, it may not be  the\r\n\r\ninformation  that he is trying to impart  which  is\r\n\r\npercolating  through.  The  pupils  may   be   more\r\n\r\ninterested in distracting background items, such as\r\n\r\nthe  way he dresses or the unerased diagram on  the\r\n\r\nblackboard.  In  the case of the mass  media  also,\r\n\r\nfull  attention is not guaranteed, and  it  may  be\r\n\r\nthat  other features are coming across besides  the\r\n\r\nintrinsic information that it is desired to convey.\r\n\r\nWhere any medium of communication is concerned,  it\r\n\r\nis the whole medium that is the message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education, therefore, has to come to the\r\n\r\naid  of  the mass media to stimulate awareness  and\r\n\r\ncommitted concern for our problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see from the experience and history\r\n\r\nof  other  countries how adult education  has  been\r\n\r\nbrought to the service of national construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, for example, adult education as a\r\n\r\nnational  movement  for the  education  of  workers\r\n\r\ncontributed  towards the redressing of  balance  of\r\n\r\nnational  and  political  influence  in  favour  of\r\n\r\nworkers.  In  Denmark, the folk high  schools  were\r\n\r\ncreated  (and I am quoting learned authority)  \"for\r\n\r\nthe  express  purpose  of refashioning  a  national\r\n\r\nculture\". In the Soviet Union adult education  (and\r\n\r\nI quote again):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`has served as an instrument of State policy\r\n\r\ndirected  at  producing loyalty to  the  state  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping   technical  competencies  required   by\r\n\r\nnational plans.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  the  process of changing China, adult education\r\n\r\nhas   had  two  functions,  namely  (and  I   quote\r\n\r\ndifferent authority now):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) breaking down the class barrier and\r\n\r\nfostering the union of workers and peasants and the\r\n\r\npatriotic intelligentsia, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) contributing to the construction of the new\r\n\r\nChina.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Chou  En-lai  has  himself  issued  \"Directives  on\r\n\r\nIncreasing Peasants' Spare-Time Education\".  Israel\r\n\r\nis   also  an  outstanding  example  of  how  adult\r\n\r\neducation,  in the Kibbutzim, in the Histadrut  and\r\n\r\nin  the  universities, has contributed to  national\r\n\r\ndevelopment. Mr Speaker, Sir, the lesson is  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  whatever the hue and complexion  adult\r\n\r\neducation has assumed in other countries, different\r\n\r\nnational  and social circumstances have  thrown  up\r\n\r\npeculiar,  specific and indigenous adult  education\r\n\r\nresponses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our own adult education scene has also been\r\n\r\ncharacterised by a gratifying ebullience, but  more\r\n\r\nimaginative  forms  should  be  encouraged  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment towards striking roots more deeply among\r\n\r\nthe  masses of our people. Remembering,  too,  that\r\n\r\nthe better educated our people are, the more firmly\r\n\r\nwe  can  make assurance doubly sure of our survival\r\n\r\nin the crucial years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I conclude, Sir - probably much to the\r\n\r\ngratification  of  hon. Members -by  expressing  my\r\n\r\nparticular  endorsement  of  the  various   details\r\n\r\nrelated  to education in its different aspects,  in\r\n\r\nseveral places in the Addendum to the speech by the\r\n\r\nPresident.  I  was happy to read the paragraphs  on\r\n\r\ntraining in the section devoted to the Ministry of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour.

May I suggest  that  there\r\n\r\nbe  not  only presentation of cultural  forms,  but\r\n\r\nthat  explanation of their meaning and significance\r\n\r\nbe also entered into more extensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note also that \"the Museum which\r\n\r\nwill  now  come under the Ministry of  Science  and\r\n\r\nTechnology  will  be  modernised  to  serve  as  an\r\n\r\neducational centre displaying in vivid  manner  the\r\n\r\nrich  political,  social and economic  history  not\r\n\r\nonly  of Singapore but of the whole region of which\r\n\r\nwe  are  the  fulcrum.\"  Up to  now  the  permanent\r\n\r\nexhibition in the Museum seems to have taken on  an\r\n\r\naspect of immutability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I, in this my maiden\r\n\r\nspeech,  express  my  respect  for  the  House  and\r\n\r\nreiterate my support of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the people in\r\n\r\nSembawang  Constituency, I fully support the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's motion. The speech made by the President\r\n\r\nin this House on the 6th of this month at 7 p.m, is\r\n\r\nundoubtedly  historic.  It  is  a  very   important\r\n\r\ndocument  for nation building. It clearly  outlines\r\n\r\nthe  three great objectives in our nation building,\r\n\r\nnamely,   the  building  of  an  effective  defence\r\n\r\ncapability  and  the promotion of greater  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth    and    the   enhancement   of    national\r\n\r\nconsciousness,  in  order to overcome  the  various\r\n\r\nproblems  that  will confront us. These  objectives\r\n\r\nclearly  show that the Government is determined  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  out in the task of nation building  in  the\r\n\r\ncoming   five  years,  namely,  to  build  a   more\r\n\r\nprosperous,   more  stable  and  more   progressive\r\n\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present our people attach\r\n\r\nmuch   importance  to  the  problems  of   how   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen our national defence and how to speed up\r\n\r\ntour economic growth. These are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajor issues affecting our national survival. If  a\r\n\r\ncountry  is  weak in its defence and is not  always\r\n\r\nprepared, then it will not be able to safeguard its\r\n\r\nindependence and sovereignty, because at the moment\r\n\r\nwe  are still in a predatory world and the ideal of\r\n\r\nhaving  one world in the future, which is cherished\r\n\r\nby all mankind, is still far ahead. Therefore, as a\r\n\r\nnewly-emergent country, in order to  safeguard  and\r\n\r\nprotect  our territorial integrity and sovereignty,\r\n\r\nand  also to protect the right of survival  of  our\r\n\r\ntwo million people, we have to build up our defence\r\n\r\nforce.   We   have  to  consolidate   our   defence\r\n\r\narrangements in order to achieve internal  security\r\n\r\nand   defence  capability.  Sir,  we,  of   course,\r\n\r\nunderstand that since we are a country of only  224\r\n\r\nsquare  miles,  it is not possible to  spend  large\r\n\r\nsums  of money and most of our resources on defence\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  If  we  do  so,  then  our  cultural,\r\n\r\neducational and social welfare programmes  will  be\r\n\r\ngreatly   curtailed.   Therefore,   we   are    now\r\n\r\nimplementing national service which stipulates that\r\n\r\nall  those citizens of 18 years of age will receive\r\n\r\ntwo years' full-time training or part-time military\r\n\r\ntraining.  Thus,  we  need maintain  only  a  small\r\n\r\nregular  army  which would be responsible  for  our\r\n\r\nmajor  defence  task. On the other  hand,  we  have\r\n\r\nquite  a large reserve force which ordinarily would\r\n\r\ncarry   on   with  their  work  in  their   various\r\n\r\ncapacities.  But when there is an emergency,  these\r\n\r\nwell-trained reserves will receive instructions  to\r\n\r\nregroup  and will be organised speedily  to  defend\r\n\r\nour security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in addition to the organisation\r\n\r\nof  our Army, we should also, at the same time, set\r\n\r\nup an Air Force and a Navy to protect our air space\r\n\r\nand  territorial  waters. On this  aspect,  let  me\r\n\r\nquote  what the Prime Minister said on the occasion\r\n\r\nof  the Military Officers Commissioning ceremony at\r\n\r\nthe  Istana Negara on 20th March. He said  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  next four years we must speedily build up  our\r\n\r\nair  defence  capability jointly with Malaysia  and\r\n\r\nother countries so that we may have a reliable  air\r\n\r\ndefence system and, at the same time, it should  be\r\n\r\none\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat can withstand any test and will live up to its\r\n\r\nreputation. This shows that the Government is quite\r\n\r\ndetermined to build up its air defence capability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we examine what we have achieved in our\r\n\r\nmilitary  build-up in the past two years  and  nine\r\n\r\nmonths,  we can be proud of the fact that  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  only organised and trained military personnel,\r\n\r\nbut   we   have   also   achieved   good   results.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we have successfully built an  armoury\r\n\r\nwhich is producing bullets, hand grenades and other\r\n\r\nweapons.  This is a very good example of our  great\r\n\r\nachievements in self-reliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of economic development, according\r\n\r\nto  the analysis given by our Finance Minister, our\r\n\r\neconomic growth mainly depends on four sectors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Import and export trade;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) tourism;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) shipping and communications;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) manufacturing industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Ever  since we won our independence and became  our\r\n\r\nown  masters,  we  have been  implementing  a  non-aligned  foreign policy and have also set  up  good\r\n\r\ntrading  relationships with  many  countries,  both\r\n\r\nCommunist  and non-Communist. Thus we have  greatly\r\n\r\nincreased our foreign trade. For instance, in  1967\r\n\r\nour  foreign  trade amounted to $7,886,510,000,  an\r\n\r\nincrease of $440 million on the figure for 1966. At\r\n\r\npresent  many countries are trying to set up  trade\r\n\r\nrelationships with us. This is a good sign. If  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  and  industrial sectors can  co-operate\r\n\r\nclosely  with the Government to promote  our  trade\r\n\r\nand  commerce, I believe that we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nincrease our foreign trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of tourism, last year about 200,000\r\n\r\ntourists came here. It would appear from this  that\r\n\r\nthe tourist trade has great hopes of expansion.  We\r\n\r\ncan now see many first-class hotels being built  to\r\n\r\nreceive tourists from other countries. I hope  that\r\n\r\nin  future more consideration will be given to  the\r\n\r\nallotment  of  expenditure to promote  tourism  and\r\n\r\nthat the Immigration Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand   other  Government  departments  dealing  with\r\n\r\ntourists  should accord them better facilities  and\r\n\r\nextend them every courteous service. These are very\r\n\r\nnecessary conditions in promoting tourism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of shipping and communications, we\r\n\r\nknow  that  we are geographically at the centre  of\r\n\r\nSouth-east Asia and also that we are at the  cross-roads  of  communication lines between  Europe  and\r\n\r\nAsia.  Recently  we have seen much  development  in\r\n\r\nthis  field. According to statistics, there are  21\r\n\r\nairlines operating regular flight services  through\r\n\r\nSingapore. Last year 964,244 air passengers  passed\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore.  This  is  about  25  per  cent\r\n\r\nincrease over that of 1966. This is a great help to\r\n\r\nour economic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is even speedier development in the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  industry. The Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nhas said that total investments in 1961 amounted to\r\n\r\n$20,400,000.  But  in 1967 they  had  increased  to\r\n\r\n$400,600,000, a twenty-fold increase. In 1961  only\r\n\r\n330  persons  were  employed in  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nindustry.  In  1967, 16,400 people  were  employed.\r\n\r\nThis  was  an  increase of 55  times  the  original\r\n\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we were at the initial stages of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,   some  people   with   ulterior\r\n\r\nmotives   and   certain   reactionary   politicians\r\n\r\ncriticised and ridiculed us, saying that  we  would\r\n\r\nsurely  fail  in our industrialisation policy.  But\r\n\r\ntoday,   seven  years  later,  we  are   witnessing\r\n\r\nindustrial   prosperity.  More  and  more   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments are flowing in constantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock temporarily in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n<br><br>5.46 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This not only earns us more foreign exchange but\r\n\r\nalso    provides    us   with    more    employment\r\n\r\nopportunities. The success of our industrialisation\r\n\r\nprogramme  shows  that if we  have  the  verve  and\r\n\r\ndetermination,  any  sort  of  difficulty  can   be\r\n\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the various Government\r\n\r\ndepartments.  There  is  one  matter  which  should\r\n\r\nreceive our attention, i.e., the Government has set\r\n\r\nup  two  new  Ministries, namely, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nScience   and   Technology  and  the  Ministry   of\r\n\r\nCommunications.  As  a matter of  fact,  these  two\r\n\r\nMinistries are vitally necessary as they fulfil the\r\n\r\nneed  of  national  development.  The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nScience and Technology will have the function of co-ordinating  the  two Universities, the  Polytechnic\r\n\r\nand  other  tertiary educational  institutes.  This\r\n\r\nMinistry is now headed by Dr Toh Chin Chye, who is\r\n\r\nconcurrently the Vice-Chancellor of the  University\r\n\r\nof Singapore. When the appointment was made, he won\r\n\r\nthe  acclaim of the academic world of the  Republic\r\n\r\nand  the Press. I believe that under his leadership\r\n\r\nthe tertiary institutions in our Republic will make\r\n\r\ngreater  progress and more orderly improvement  and\r\n\r\nthat  more talented and capable nationals  will  be\r\n\r\ntrained for nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Communications will have the\r\n\r\nstupendous  task of solving our traffic congestion.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  statistics,  the  total  number   of\r\n\r\nvehicles  last year was 578,855. Of these,  116,000\r\n\r\nwere  private  vehicles. With a population  of  two\r\n\r\nmillion people, it means that there was one car for\r\n\r\nevery  four  persons.  On the other  hand,  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion has also resulted in an increase of road\r\n\r\naccidents. The 1966 statistics show that the number\r\n\r\nof  people who died in road accidents was  251  and\r\n\r\nthe number who were severely injured was 1,646, the\r\n\r\nnumber  slightly  injured was  7,576.  In  November\r\n\r\n1967,  the  number  of  people  who  died  in  road\r\n\r\naccidents was 207 and the number who were  severely\r\n\r\ninjured  was  1,575, while those who were  slightly\r\n\r\ninjured was 7,769. These figures are shocking.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Communications, under the leadership of\r\n\r\nMr Yong Nyuk Lin, in conjunction with the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  National  Development,  will  have  to  find  a\r\n\r\nsolution to our problem of traffic congestion so as\r\n\r\nto reduce the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnumber  of road accidents and to minimise the  loss\r\n\r\nof lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to say some-thing about the\r\n\r\nwork of converting the Naval Base at Sembawang into\r\n\r\na commercial dockyard. According to the Addendum to\r\n\r\nthe President's Speech, the work of conversion will\r\n\r\nbe  carried out this year. As the representative of\r\n\r\nSembawang,  I have reason to be glad about  such  a\r\n\r\nproject,  because  it  will not  only  provide  job\r\n\r\nopportunities  for more than 11,000  people  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency and their families, but it  will  also\r\n\r\nplay  a  very  important  role  in  promoting   our\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity. As a matter of fact,  this  5-mile  long  Naval  Base is a  great  asset  to  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  It  is the greatest naval  base  for  the\r\n\r\nBritish  Empire. But as a result of the  change  in\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the British will be withdrawing  its\r\n\r\nentire  forces  at the end of 1971  and  they  will\r\n\r\nleave   behind  all  the  facilities   there.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now decided to convert  the  Naval\r\n\r\nBase   into   a   gigantic   commercial   dockyard.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  after 1971 the Naval Base will  not  be\r\n\r\ndead. On the contrary, it will be a busier and more\r\n\r\nactive dockyard and bring greater prosperity to our\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me touch on education. From now\r\n\r\nonwards  the  emphasis will be switched  over  from\r\n\r\nacademic education to technology and science so  as\r\n\r\nto fulfil the need of industrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been great improvement and\r\n\r\nreforms in the fields of culture, health and social\r\n\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the President's policy speech is a very\r\n\r\nimportant  document because it  lays  down  correct\r\n\r\ndirections  in national construction for  the  next\r\n\r\nfive  years.  It will enable us to achieve  greater\r\n\r\nprosperity.  With  political  stability,   economic\r\n\r\nsecurity  and other favourable factors for economic\r\n\r\nexpansion,  I  believe that if the people  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can work closely together in the crucial\r\n\r\nyears  ahead,  they  will not  be  daunted  by  the\r\n\r\nformidable challenges facing them.

In\r\n\r\nspite  of  everything, the President had graciously\r\n\r\ncome  to  this  House  and  honoured  us  with  his\r\n\r\npresence, and to state the Government's policy  for\r\n\r\nthe  crucial  years  ahead. He  has  correctly  and\r\n\r\nsuccinctly diagnosed a possible malaise to which we\r\n\r\nmay  succumb in the next few years if we  are  less\r\n\r\nrobust  and less prepared. He charted a course  for\r\n\r\nus  in  the  field  of  defence,  anticipating  the\r\n\r\nBritish  withdrawal of their Armed Forces in  1971.\r\n\r\nHe  told us that we have very little time indeed to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  our military muscles. He also warned  us\r\n\r\nthat  our  military muscles are built, and subsist,\r\n\r\non adequate economic health. Thus, unless we can in\r\n\r\nthe  next  few  years consolidate  and  expand  our\r\n\r\neconomic well-being, our security will rest on weak\r\n\r\nground.  In  order  that we have adequate  military\r\n\r\nmight  underpinned by adequate economic  resources,\r\n\r\nthe  President  informed us that we  will  have  to\r\n\r\ngalvanise  our people into a closely-knit  society,\r\n\r\neach conscious of his own, his neighbour's and  the\r\n\r\ncollective  response of citizenship and nationhood.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  living  as  we are a  comparatively  small\r\n\r\ngroup  of two million people compressed in an  area\r\n\r\nof 225 square miles, we can only survive, let alone\r\n\r\nprosper,  if the people are absolutely  united  and\r\n\r\nact  consciously  as  a  single  body  towards  the\r\n\r\nnational goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an Addendum to the President's Speech, various\r\n\r\nMinistries  have outlined the programmes  by  which\r\n\r\nthey  anticipate  that the problems  posed  by  the\r\n\r\nPresident will be adequately met and solved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Finance has the task of not only\r\n\r\nproviding  the  economic  sinews  to  our  military\r\n\r\nmuscles   but   of  solving  the  more  fundamental\r\n\r\nproblems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  economic expansion and the enhancement  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic  welfare of the population.  The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance has correctly assessed the position  in\r\n\r\nhis  two  speeches  in  the series  of  Ministerial\r\n\r\nbroadcasts. The basic problem, of course,  is  that\r\n\r\nwe   have   right  now  a  grave  and   substantial\r\n\r\nunemployment   problem.  This   problem   will   be\r\n\r\naggravated and magnified by the British pull-out in\r\n\r\n1971. It is also aggravated by the annual output of\r\n\r\nschool-leavers seeking employment between  now  and\r\n\r\n1971.  The  basic solution to this problem  is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  a simple one of providing more jobs.  But,\r\n\r\nas  is  usual,  simple answers to problems  require\r\n\r\ncomplex methods to effect. The first difficulty  in\r\n\r\nthis  apparently simple solution  is  to  find  the\r\n\r\nnecessary funds for capital investment. The Finance\r\n\r\nMinister  has proposed schemes for the mobilisation\r\n\r\nof  both domestic and foreign capital. One  of  the\r\n\r\nways he proposes to mobilise domestic capital is to\r\n\r\nincrease Provident Fund contributions from both the\r\n\r\nemployee  and  the employer. Detailed workings  are\r\n\r\nyet  to  be  announced. But at this  stage,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary to draw the attention of the Minister  to\r\n\r\ngrave  and  adverse repercussions if  the  detailed\r\n\r\nworkings are not adequately thought out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, of course, a good thing for an employee to\r\n\r\ncontribute more towards the Fund which will  either\r\n\r\nyield  him better security in his old age  or  will\r\n\r\npermit  him to own his house which, in view of  the\r\n\r\nland  shortage  in Singapore, will  undoubtedly  in\r\n\r\ntime get an enhanced value. The difficulty here  is\r\n\r\nto  draw a line separating those who can contribute\r\n\r\nmore  towards desirable objectives, and  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  to pay an additional levy which, however well\r\n\r\nmeant,   will   cause  immediate   and   unbearable\r\n\r\nhardship.  I should, therefore, like to  appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe  Finance  Minister to give serious  thought  to\r\n\r\nwhere  this  line  should  be  drawn.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nundoubtedly a very good thing for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nemployers to play their part in contributing to the\r\n\r\nFund which, as I have said earlier, will serve very\r\n\r\ndesirable  objectives. Here again,  the  difficulty\r\n\r\nwill be to determine whether there will or will not\r\n\r\nbe  a  class  of employees from whom any additional\r\n\r\nlevies may mean the difference between survival and\r\n\r\nbankruptcy. Nobody in this House believes that  our\r\n\r\nFinance Minister wants to mobilise capital even  at\r\n\r\nthe  expense of killing it. But it can well  happen\r\n\r\nif  detailed  workings are not  adequately  thought\r\n\r\nout. Arising from this, a further point is that  an\r\n\r\nadditional  levy on the employer for the  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  is,  in  fact,  a  statutory  rise  for   the\r\n\r\nemployee.  This means that the cost  of  production\r\n\r\nwill rise varying with the amount of labour content\r\n\r\nin  the  product.  On the one  hand,  we  need  and\r\n\r\nsolicit both local and foreign investment.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  we  are, as it were,  passing  a  law\r\n\r\ncompelling  higher wages. Whether the  higher  wage\r\n\r\ncost  will  deter  investment  is  something  which\r\n\r\neconomic experts in the Finance Ministry will  have\r\n\r\nto  work  out  with great care. Not  equipped  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  data  to make my own analysis,  I  will\r\n\r\ncontent  myself  by drawing the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister to the possible adverse effects which this\r\n\r\nhighly commendable scheme may induce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Labour legislation is to be introduced, as it\r\n\r\nwere, to back up the economic policy of the Finance\r\n\r\nMinister. It is intended that there shall  be  less\r\n\r\nabuses  by  labour, higher labour productivity  and\r\n\r\nlonger working hours. As I have said earlier, it is\r\n\r\ndesirable  and  even commendable  for  us  to  gird\r\n\r\nourselves  for difficult times ahead. But,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, it is not amiss here to sound a warning\r\n\r\nthat when trying to galvanise ourselves, we do  not\r\n\r\nsacrifice  our human dignity and human  values.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  bear this very much in mind  whenever  we\r\n\r\nlegislate  and we have also to convince our  people\r\n\r\nthat the measures we think are good for them do not\r\n\r\ntake  away  from them those human values  which  we\r\n\r\ncherish.  For instance, when applying  the  uniform\r\n\r\nrate of 44 working\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhours per week, a large number of people will  have\r\n\r\ntheir working hours extended. It is true that  some\r\n\r\nof  them  have  acquired the advantage  of  shorter\r\n\r\nworking  hours  not because our  society  or  their\r\n\r\nemployers can afford it, but because they  happened\r\n\r\nto  be  in a union that was strong enough to secure\r\n\r\nan  advantage over workers in other enterprises  or\r\n\r\nin  other industries. Such people must be convinced\r\n\r\nthat  the  unpleasant medicine prescribed  will  be\r\n\r\ngood for them as well as for our whole society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the economic policies proposed by\r\n\r\nthe Finance Minister, I cannot help feeling that in\r\n\r\nhis proposals lie a depth and width of thought that\r\n\r\nwill  command  confidence. For instance,  for  some\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time  in the past, vociferous  voices\r\n\r\nwere  heard  in Singapore on how our tourist  trade\r\n\r\ncould  be developed. There were proposals  to  have\r\n\r\ngambling joints, striptease acts and the like.  The\r\n\r\nthought  was  that if Singapore could provide  such\r\n\r\nfacilities,  tourists would flock to Singapore.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt,  the exotic and the unique may attract  some\r\n\r\ntourists,  but in this field, we are in competition\r\n\r\nwith  places of high living scattered all over  the\r\n\r\nworld.  The  real  answer  to  attracting  tourists\r\n\r\nreally lies in what the Finance Minister has lately\r\n\r\nproposed, and that is if only we can move the focal\r\n\r\npoint or turning point of air routes from Singapore\r\n\r\nto  Bali which has all the natural attractions  for\r\n\r\ntourists,  then  they  cannot  help  but  come   to\r\n\r\nSingapore on their way to Bali. This, to  my  mind,\r\n\r\nindicates very forcefully the depth of thinking and\r\n\r\ntrue answer to the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I should like to refer briefly\r\n\r\nto    the   Prime   Minister's   speech   when   he\r\n\r\ncongratulated you, Sir, on your election as Speaker\r\n\r\nto   the   House.  He  referred  to  a  number   of\r\n\r\nparliamentarians who have not experienced the rough\r\n\r\nand tumble of elections, or the nasty intrigues  of\r\n\r\ninter-party  warfare.  As  a  Backbencher  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I  should like to take this opportunity  of\r\n\r\nassuring him that though we lack the battle  scars,\r\n\r\nwe have the intelligence, the will and the capacity\r\n\r\nto learn from the old war-horses,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalbeit  in  a  second-hand  manner,  the  traumatic\r\n\r\nexperiences, of fights in the Thai boxing style, so\r\n\r\nthat if and when the situation demands, we will  be\r\n\r\nno  less  prepared  than those who  have actually\r\n\r\nfought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to express\r\n\r\nmy views in support of the Address of thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Singapore is a small island and a young\r\n\r\nnation, its population has progressive ideas and is\r\n\r\nactive  in all fields, especially in the  field  of\r\n\r\npolitics.  As  a  nation  practising  parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy, our Government is elected by the  people\r\n\r\nwho  will feel its rule for another five years. All\r\n\r\nGovernment  planning  and  development  will  prove\r\n\r\nwhether the Government is sincere or insincere. The\r\n\r\npeople  will  then be able to judge when  the  time\r\n\r\ncomes  for  fresh  elections. The  victory  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P, in the last elections proves that the people\r\n\r\nare  confident that  the P.A.P, will discharge  its\r\n\r\nresponsibility to the people and lead the nation to\r\n\r\nprosperity.  Prosperity will not come  about  until\r\n\r\nthe rural people's problems can be solved. In rural\r\n\r\nareas   like   Geylang  Serai,   plans   for   road\r\n\r\nimprovements,  street lighting and drainage  cannot\r\n\r\nbe implemented if the sum allocated by the Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee  for  Geylang Serai is for only  $13,200.\r\n\r\nThis  sum  is inadequate to meet even the  cost  of\r\n\r\nimproving  one road. The Projects Committee  should\r\n\r\nhave  reviewed the minutes of meetings of the Urban\r\n\r\nand  Rural  Services Committee in order to  improve\r\n\r\nall  the  roads  in  Geylang Serai.  \"The  Projects\r\n\r\nCommittee will then know how much it will  cost  to\r\n\r\nimprove  one  road  in Geylang Serai.

I  would  suggest  that  the  Government\r\n\r\nconsider   making  the  diversion  at   the   early\r\n\r\nsecondary school stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the creation of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nScience   and   Technology  indeed  announces   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's recognition of the indispensability of\r\n\r\nscience and technology in economic development  and\r\n\r\nits  intention  to fashion our human  resources  to\r\n\r\nserve  commerce  and  industry.  Planning  in  this\r\n\r\ndirection   calls   for   increasing   numbers   of\r\n\r\ngraduates, in science and engineering and  the  re-ordering  of  the  priorities in  learning  at  the\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  level to provide  the  necessary\r\n\r\nmathematical  and  science  teaching  followed   by\r\n\r\ntechnical    college   or   university    training.\r\n\r\nInitially,  to  harness the human resources  for  a\r\n\r\nsizable   impact  of  science  and  technology   on\r\n\r\neconomic  development, there must be a considerable\r\n\r\noption  for science and technology on the  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  parents of the students. Effective  persuasion\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this  option would be  the  increasing\r\n\r\ndemonstration and its advertisement of the prestige\r\n\r\nthat, this Government and commerce and industry are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accord to science and  technology  by\r\n\r\nreflecting  the economic importance  of  scientists\r\n\r\nand technologists in their salary structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that the intended reform\r\n\r\nin  examinations as stated in the Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech will modify or abolish  in  toto\r\n\r\nthe Primary School Leaving Examination. As long  as\r\n\r\nthis examination becomes the arbiter of the destiny\r\n\r\nof  the  Primary VI student, when its  computations\r\n\r\ndecide  that he is either' academically fitted  for\r\n\r\nsecondary  academic or technical education,  which,\r\n\r\nas  he  understands  it, holds promise  of  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment  at  the end of it, or  that  he  is  an\r\n\r\nacademic  failure,  a reject or a  mere  vocational\r\n\r\nprobable,  with, as he understands it, an uncertain\r\n\r\nfuture; and as long as this examination remains,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of examination it is, requiring  of  the\r\n\r\nstudent   only  abundant  knowledge   without   the\r\n\r\nfacilities  of verbal and written expression  which\r\n\r\nare   its  necessary  concomitants,  so  long  will\r\n\r\nprimary  school teaching be focused on  success  in\r\n\r\nthe  Primary  School  Leaving Examination,  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of the development of the skills in verbal\r\n\r\nand  written  expression which  are  the  requisite\r\n\r\nmechanics of articulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the secondary schools, teaching becomes\r\n\r\nfocused  on the need to pass the School Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination.  The urgency of this  makes  secondary\r\n\r\nschool  teaching impatient of the need  to  develop\r\n\r\nthe skill to compose or to articulate orally or  in\r\n\r\nwriting  other  than the minimal ability  which  is\r\n\r\nrequired   for  examination  purposes.   Only   the\r\n\r\nbrighter student excels on his own effort. The non-retention  policy by which the student  of  maximum\r\n\r\nage for that class is promoted to the next grade at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of the year, despite his failure  in  the\r\n\r\nterminal  examinations, progressively  worsens  his\r\n\r\ninarticulateness  apart from his  overall  ability.\r\n\r\nSir,  this  is  a  decline which must  be  arrested\r\n\r\nimmediately. For one thing, if we are to  hope  for\r\n\r\nthe   emergence  of  a  responsible  and  effective\r\n\r\nOpposition  as suggested by the Prime  Minister  in\r\n\r\nhis speech offering sound alternatives to help work\r\n\r\nthe  machine  of  parliamentary democracy  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry, there must be opinion in our society,  and\r\n\r\nthe   initial  pre-requisite  to  opinion  is   the\r\n\r\narticulateness of the knowledgeable  elite  of  the\r\n\r\npopulace.  In  addition, there must  be  a  climate\r\n\r\nwhich  positively  encourages  the  expression   of\r\n\r\nopinion. The elite in this country is a rich  human\r\n\r\nresource  with considerable capacity to  contribute\r\n\r\nto  the  nation  but  which  unfortunately  remains\r\n\r\nintellectually unagitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as suggested, the Primary School Leaving\r\n\r\nExamination  may  be  suitably  modified  or   even\r\n\r\nabolished  and  in  its place a  system  of  annual\r\n\r\nassessment  set up. Perhaps the School  Certificate\r\n\r\nExamination  may be broken up into  two  stages  so\r\n\r\nthat the secondary student\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noffers a number of subjects at the first sitting in\r\n\r\nSecondary III and the other half in Secondary IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg your indulgence if I descend into\r\n\r\nthese  details but I do so by way of commenting  on\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of the Government. This  would,  to  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent,  dilute  the  examination  urgency\r\n\r\nwhich   tends  to  pervade  the  secondary   school\r\n\r\natmosphere and make room for additional subjects in\r\n\r\nthe  time-table  also.  The  practical  problem  of\r\n\r\nexamination-paper  marking for the  Primary  School\r\n\r\nLeaving Examination is recognised. Change is urged,\r\n\r\nbut   change  is  urged  without  sacrificing   the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the system or the  teacher  through\r\n\r\nsheer overloading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reform in the field of teacher-training and re-training is a necessary undertaking in the effort\r\n\r\nto achieve qualitative improvement. This would also\r\n\r\nbe  the  necessary measure to take  in  conjunction\r\n\r\nwith  the  reorganisation of the secondary  schools\r\n\r\ntowards  an industrial re-orientation. It is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat  the  extent  of  the  intended  reform  would\r\n\r\ninclude an examination of the basis of selection of\r\n\r\nstudent  teachers  for  training  with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nformulating  the basis which would in some  measure\r\n\r\nensure that student teachers selected thereby would\r\n\r\nmanifest,  or  contain a potential to manifest,  in\r\n\r\nsome   degree   the   natural   teaching   ability,\r\n\r\nselflessness   and   the   dedication   which   the\r\n\r\nprofession  demands. I am given to understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  selection of student teachers for training  is\r\n\r\ndone  by  the  computations of  a  computer.  While\r\n\r\nalmost  every  student teacher with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nacademic    qualifications   can   instruct    upon\r\n\r\ngraduating from the Teachers' Training College, not\r\n\r\nevery graduate can teach. Teaching is a personal or\r\n\r\npersonalised  activity motivated by  considerations\r\n\r\nof  concern, interest, professional pride  and  the\r\n\r\ndesire to give of oneself. All these considerations\r\n\r\nmay  be absent in academic qualifications no matter\r\n\r\nhow  impressive they may be. In this regard,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that I am also voicing the sentiments  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now, I have been wont to regard a\r\n\r\nlarge number of our schools as hardly anything more\r\n\r\nthan   centres  of  instruction  and  teachers   as\r\n\r\ninstructors.  Qualitative improvement  in  teacher-training  and re-training, together with the  other\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  reforms intended,  would  eventually\r\n\r\nrestore  the  school and the teacher  in  place  of\r\n\r\ncentres of instruction and instructors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be pertinent for the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider  also  the desirability of  decentralising\r\n\r\ncertain  facets  of school supervision  and  school\r\n\r\nadministration, and to enhance the answerability of\r\n\r\nthe  school  head and his staff for all affairs  of\r\n\r\nthe  school.  This suggested trend may  succeed  in\r\n\r\nachieving that total committal of the head  of  the\r\n\r\nschool  and  his staff to the school, its  prestige\r\n\r\nand its overall performance which, in the course of\r\n\r\ntime, sets -the school tone and tradition. However,\r\n\r\nachievement  in this direction is unlikely  if  the\r\n\r\nfrequency  of  the  transfer of  school  heads  and\r\n\r\nteachers  from school to school is not  reduced  to\r\n\r\nminimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business of qualitative improvement in\r\n\r\nmatters  educational is that of  a  research  body,\r\n\r\npreferably  an  education research council.  It  is\r\n\r\nsignificant instruction for those interested in edu\r\n\r\ncation  that at this stage of education development\r\n\r\nin our country the only research unit in the field,\r\n\r\nas  I  understand it, is in the Teachers'  Training\r\n\r\nCollege,  which  is  hardly satisfactory.  I  would\r\n\r\nsuggest the initiation of thinking in the direction\r\n\r\nof  an  Education  Act  which would  incorporate  a\r\n\r\nnational   science  and  educational  policy,   the\r\n\r\nstructure  and administration of education  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  and  which would set  up  an  independent\r\n\r\neducational research council along the lines of the\r\n\r\nresearch  council in the English Education  Act  of\r\n\r\n1943.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creation of the Sports Division has been\r\n\r\ntimely.  The numerous sports bodies in the Republic\r\n\r\nwould expect the Sports Division or, in particular,\r\n\r\nthe  Sports  Promotion Office in  the  Division  to\r\n\r\nformulate and execute a comprehensive  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogramme of sports promotion. It is  hoped\r\n\r\nthat this activity may be undertaken unobtrusively,\r\n\r\nfor  I  believe that the Sports Division, as it  is\r\n\r\nconstituted,  is  intended  to  function   in   co-ordination  with  the voluntary  effort  of  sports\r\n\r\nbodies in the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Stadium at Kallang when completed\r\n\r\nwill,  it  is  hoped,  be a, pride  to  all  sports\r\n\r\nenthusiasts  in the Republic. And  I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nDivision has plans for an Asian or Southeast  Asian\r\n\r\nGames at the Stadium to inaugurate its opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to physical education, if our school-leavers are intended to constitute the industrial\r\n\r\nhuman  resource and a military potential  with  the\r\n\r\nphysical   stamina  and  ruggedness   which   these\r\n\r\noccupations  demand,  then the  Physical  Education\r\n\r\nDepartment  would require to take more manpower  in\r\n\r\norder  to execute a programme of physical education\r\n\r\nin  schools  with the necessary stress, vigour  and\r\n\r\ncontinuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I only wish to say that I\r\n\r\nsupport the motion before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.37 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  the  President's Speech to  the  House  he  has\r\n\r\noutlined  the objectives ahead which, to  my  mind,\r\n\r\nare  a  logical sequence to the events taking place\r\n\r\nduring the past years. In -the past five years, one\r\n\r\nof  the most significant developments has been  the\r\n\r\ndynamic  outlook  of  our political  leadership  in\r\n\r\nmaintaining   and   improving  the   infrastructure\r\n\r\nnecessary  for greater economic growth. The  skill,\r\n\r\ningenuity and persistence demonstrated by those  in\r\n\r\noffice  in  the formulation of policies  have  been\r\n\r\nmatched   by   the   same  skill,   ingenuity   and\r\n\r\npersistence of our people in -their response and in\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of such policies  both  in  the\r\n\r\npublic  and private sectors. Within a comparatively\r\n\r\nshort  span  of  time, we have achieved  what  many\r\n\r\nsceptics  consider to be impossible in our  attempt\r\n\r\nto  strengthen  and  diversify our  economy.  Today\r\n\r\nJurong is a thriving industrial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nestate of more than 50 factories. Our port and  air\r\n\r\ntravel  facilities are far more  superior  to  what\r\n\r\nthey  were  five years ago. What is  more,  we  are\r\n\r\nalready getting ready for -the container ships  and\r\n\r\nthe jumbo jets. Instead of higher wages and a wider\r\n\r\nrange  of  fringe benefits, our union leaders  have\r\n\r\ntaken to talking in terms of productivity. The pre-conditions,  both material and social  for  greater\r\n\r\neconomic growth, have thus been set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking forward we have, however, no cause for\r\n\r\ncomplacency. We have been warned of external forces\r\n\r\nat  work  which  are  likely to  have  far-reaching\r\n\r\neffects   and  repercussions  upon  our   sensitive\r\n\r\nposition,  politically and economically, and  which\r\n\r\nwill  render our tasks ahead more difficult. If  we\r\n\r\nare  to  survive  and prosper, the dynamic  outlook\r\n\r\nwill have to be maintained and sustained. It is not\r\n\r\nsufficient  that those in power alone  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  lead, as unless all  the  people  are\r\n\r\ngeared to a continuous process of adaptation  in  a\r\n\r\nchanging  world, we shall soon be left behind.  The\r\n\r\ntimely and welcome change in the attitudes of union\r\n\r\nleaders has signified a healthier climate conducive\r\n\r\nto  greater economic growth. It remains  for  these\r\n\r\nattitudes to be applied and practised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is heartening to see that a comprehensive and\r\n\r\nundoubtedly revolutionary Employment Bill  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  aimed  at increasing  productivity  and\r\n\r\npromoting more industrial growth. However,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen  pointed Out by the hon. Member for  Bukit  Ho\r\n\r\nSwee, productivity is the concern not only of those\r\n\r\nwho are managed but also of those who manage. It is\r\n\r\nimperative, therefore, if the congenial  atmosphere\r\n\r\nis  to  be maintained at all, management in general\r\n\r\nshould   equally  play  their  part.   Apart   from\r\n\r\ndeveloping more efficient management techniques and\r\n\r\nexpertise,  it  will be their duty to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nappropriate incentives are devised and  offered  to\r\n\r\nthe  employees. Greater appreciation of life in and\r\n\r\naround  Singapore is important,  and  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndisastrous for all concerned if employers  were  to\r\n\r\nexploit the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Sir, it occurs to me that as\r\n\r\nthe  major part of our national savings are in  the\r\n\r\nhands  of  financial institutions, this  particular\r\n\r\nsector,  although  by  the  very  nature  of  their\r\n\r\nbusiness must be international in their outlook and\r\n\r\noperation,  should  perhaps  begin  to  divert  and\r\n\r\nharness a greater part of the substantial wealth in\r\n\r\ntheir  hands  to  the  more  pressing  needs   and\r\n\r\nrequirements  of the country, particularly  in  the\r\n\r\ncontext   of  industrialisation.  These   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  will  soon have -the  opportunity  of\r\n\r\ndemonstrating their patriotism or their support for\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy by subscribing to the  new\r\n\r\nand   attractive   Government  securities   to   be\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Ministry of Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In perusing the outlined policy of each of the\r\n\r\nMinistries,  one cannot but sense the  cohesiveness\r\n\r\nof  purpose in the planning. The overhauling of our\r\n\r\neducational   system  with  greater   emphasis   on\r\n\r\ntechnological   and   vocational   training,   the\r\n\r\nexpansion   and  improvements  proposed   for   our\r\n\r\ntransportation and communications, and the numerous\r\n\r\nother  plans  envisaged by the  various  Ministries\r\n\r\nwill,  I  feel  sure,  jointly  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\neconomic well-being and security of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as a Member from a constituency\r\n\r\nessentially  agrarian in nature, I  am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nnote  that particular emphasis will be laid by  the\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department of the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development on the promotion of intensive\r\n\r\nand  diversified farming to make maximum use of our\r\n\r\nlimited  land  resources.
