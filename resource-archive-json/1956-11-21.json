It is not a question of economy. The\r\n\r\nquestion   is   how  this  figure - an  increase   of\r\n\r\n$24,000 - is arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N.

Sir, in the inter-Party  talks\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes of the constitutional conference\r\n\r\nin  London,  it  was  apparent  that  there  was  a\r\n\r\ndivision   of   views  as  to  the   propriety   of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation of the judiciary. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nsay  for myself and for my Party that we are deeply\r\n\r\nconvinced  that it is a matter of vital  importance\r\n\r\nthat the security of tenure of the Judges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould in no way be broached. Sir, we may prefer to\r\n\r\nhave our own men who understand our ways as Judges,\r\n\r\nbut we do recognise that for decades the expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials  who have acted as Judges have maintained\r\n\r\na  tradition  and an integrity which have  been  an\r\n\r\ninspiration not only to members of the Bench in the\r\n\r\nlower Courts, not only to the Bar, but to the whole\r\n\r\npopulation    who   respect   and    admire    this\r\n\r\nadministration of justice. In the circumstances, if\r\n\r\nonly  as  an  expression of our gratitude  for  the\r\n\r\nevolution   and  maintenance  of  this  very   high\r\n\r\ntradition, we should not in any way interfere  with\r\n\r\nthe security of tenure which they enjoy. But I must\r\n\r\nadd this, Sir: that if this colonial reluctance  to\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of local men as Judges is  pursued\r\n\r\nby  forcing  upon  the country  further  expatriate\r\n\r\nJudges,  then  the position may well be  endangered\r\n\r\nand  I,  for one, would deeply regret it.  I  would\r\n\r\nplead  with the Chief Minister to use his influence\r\n\r\nwith  the  Governor to see that the  harmony  which\r\n\r\nexists  between the people and the judiciary should\r\n\r\nin  no way be upset by unwise appointments which go\r\n\r\ncontrary to the feelings of the people. Our  people\r\n\r\nare  a decent people, Sir, and their attitude is  a\r\n\r\nsimple  one,  namely, that what has been  done  has\r\n\r\nbeen done. The officials appointed have done a good\r\n\r\njob  of `work. Let us not interfere with them,  but\r\n\r\ndo not appoint more expatriates. It is time we were\r\n\r\ngiven  a  chance.  If you appoint  more  expatriate\r\n\r\nofficials  with the possibility that  this  country\r\n\r\nwill  have  for the next 15 or 20 years  expatriate\r\n\r\nJudges,  then  the question of Malayanisation  must\r\n\r\nbecome an acute, a topical and a necessary one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would plead that the Governor be informed\r\n\r\nof  the view that I believe the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nhold - that  it  would  be  inappropriate   at   this\r\n\r\njuncture   of   our  development  to   ignore   the\r\n\r\nexperienced, seasoned legal men we have  who  could\r\n\r\nbe   appointed   to  the  posts   of   honour   and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of Judges, and  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nwrong to appoint further expatriates as Judges, not\r\n\r\nonly  because it would go contrary to  our  wishes,\r\n\r\nwhich may or may not matter to the Governor, but it\r\n\r\nwould go contrary to the interests of the judiciary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are now in existence.

I  would  plead that  a  practical  and\r\n\r\nsensible  approach  to  the  people's  wishes   be\r\n\r\nconsidered and that colonial powers should lot  be\r\n\r\nexercised  to  ride roughshod not  only  over  our\r\n\r\ninterests but over the permanent interests of  the\r\n\r\njudiciary themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

We\r\n\r\nare  convinced that no politics should be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  influence  any  appointment to  the  judiciary\r\n\r\nbecause  in the Judges are entrusted the  security\r\n\r\nand  the  future of a country. So far we  can  say\r\n\r\nwith  pride  that our Judges have always  won  our\r\n\r\nadmiration,  and for their work we  are  grateful,\r\n\r\nand  we should all give support to see that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be permanency of tenure for those who  are\r\n\r\nalready  on  the  Bench. But I do agree  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  at  large  and  the  Bar  are  very   much\r\n\r\nconcerned about the delay in appointing additional\r\n\r\nJudges. I am told that some of the civil cases  in\r\n\r\nCourt  have  to wait for as long as six  to  eight\r\n\r\nmonths  before  they can be heard. This  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs  cannot be tolerated and I would urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernor  and  the  Government  to  consider   the\r\n\r\nappointment  of additional Judges without  further\r\n\r\ndelay.

Perhaps, to  refresh  his\r\n\r\nmemory, I may be allowed to read from col.  178  in\r\n\r\nHansard of the 7th of September:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As means of communication develop, so one tends\r\n\r\nto  use them. The habit has grown steadily over the\r\n\r\nyears to communicate by telegram and radiogram.  It\r\n\r\nsaves  much  time  and, I think, leads  to  greater\r\n\r\nefficiency  and the speedier despatch of Government\r\n\r\nbusiness.  The  practice  is  common  not  only  in\r\n\r\nGovernment but also in business and other  circles.\r\n\r\nFollowing    this    growing   habit,    Government\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on telegrams has tended  to  increase.\r\n\r\nExpenditure  over the past five years has  been  as\r\n\r\nfollows:   1952,  $l2,000;  1953,  $19,000;   1954,\r\n\r\n$23,000;  1955,  $38,000; from 1st January  to  9th\r\n\r\nAugust, 1956, $32,000. The considerable increase in\r\n\r\n1956  over 1955 figures has been due, in the  main,\r\n\r\nto   increased   communication  on   constitutional\r\n\r\nmatters  in  the  early  part  of  this  year.  The\r\n\r\noriginal   vote  has  now  been  expended   and   a\r\n\r\nsupplement  of $30,000 is asked for. This  estimate\r\n\r\nwas  made  in  early June on the basis  of  average\r\n\r\nmonthly expenditure in the first part of the  year.\r\n\r\nThere  has been a slight falling off in expenditure\r\n\r\nsince  that date but the application has been  kept\r\n\r\nto  the  same level in order to cover all  possible\r\n\r\ncontingencies  in  the future. There  has  been  no\r\n\r\nextravagance   in   expenditure.   Telegrams    are\r\n\r\ndespatched to all quarters of the globe  and  cover\r\n\r\nthe multifarious business of Government.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure at the present time is running to the\r\n\r\norder  of  $4,850 a month and, on  that  basis,  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  necessary  to ask for  $48,000  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming  year. There will be increased communication\r\n\r\nin  connection  with the Merdeka talks  which  will\r\n\r\ntake  place  in  February and no  doubt  afterwards\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  further  need  to  communicate  by\r\n\r\ntelegram.

I am afraid I cannot give him a  detailed\r\n\r\nbreakdown  between the heaven-born, the  lower-born\r\n\r\nand  the  medium-born, but I can give  him  two  or\r\n\r\nthree points which may help to explain the figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not only to provide passages for\r\n\r\nEuropean  officers whose passages are,  of  course,\r\n\r\nprovided  as  part of their conditions  of  service\r\n\r\nand, speaking for the majority of those officers, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  think  they have any wish to  be  made  to\r\n\r\ntravel by air. I think they all prefer to have  the\r\n\r\nlonger holiday and travel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby   sea,   perhaps  even  more   so   in   present\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  But  the  hard  fact  is  that  the\r\n\r\ndemands of the public service very frequently  make\r\n\r\nit  necessary that an officer, who would prefer  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  leisurely three weeks' voyage by  sea,  be\r\n\r\nasked to travel by air so that he may return to his\r\n\r\nduty earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of information that I would like to\r\n\r\nmake  is that this sum is not exclusively spent  on\r\n\r\nexpatriate   officers   enjoying   their   generous\r\n\r\nconditions of service. A very substantial  part  of\r\n\r\nthis  money  goes  to  meet  the  cost  of  sending\r\n\r\nofficers  and  others  from  Singapore  to   attend\r\n\r\nconferences and other occasions overseas.  I  think\r\n\r\nhon. Members will be aware that in the last year - in\r\n\r\nfact,  in recent years - we have more and more  taken\r\n\r\nthe    opportunity   of   sending   our   officers,\r\n\r\nparticularly our local officers, overseas to attend\r\n\r\nconferences  and  international meetings  where  we\r\n\r\nhope  that  not only will they profit by  attending\r\n\r\nthese  meetings  but  that  they  may  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontribute to them.

I  remember  this question was  thrashed  out\r\n\r\nyears  back in the City Council. Sir, what actually\r\n\r\nhappens is that air passages in many cases nowadays\r\n\r\nare much cheaper than first-class sea passages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, when you send an officer by sea,\r\n\r\nhe  takes, say, 25 days to reach the United Kingdom\r\n\r\nand  the  same period to come back, and during  all\r\n\r\nthat  time - 50 days in all - he is being paid a salary\r\n\r\nand  he  does not have to do any work.

On page 53, sub-head 12, I\r\n\r\nsee that $12,000 is provided for telephones for the\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary's Office. I say \"Office\"  and  not\r\n\r\n\"Ministry\",  because this $12,000 is  required  for\r\n\r\ntelephones  within that little building in  Empress\r\n\r\nPlace.  At  $135 for a business line, it works  out\r\n\r\nroughly  to  about 90 direct lines for  that  small\r\n\r\nbuilding.  It  is  really surprising  that  such  a\r\n\r\nlittle  building should require 90 direct lines.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  many of the officers working  in  that\r\n\r\nbuilding  have  a separate line for  themselves,  a\r\n\r\nline  from  the  Exchange to  that  building  whose\r\n\r\ntelephone  number is 2403, and how many more  lines\r\n\r\nthere are in their residences. I am quite sure that\r\n\r\nthis   figure  of  $12,000  covers  the  telephones\r\n\r\nrequired  for the residences as well. I would  like\r\n\r\nthe  Chief  Secretary to inform us how many  direct\r\n\r\nlines  there are to that building, how many outside\r\n\r\nlines there are to that exchange of 2403, how  many\r\n\r\ninternal lines from that exchange of 2403, and  how\r\n\r\nmany  telephones are provided for officers in  that\r\n\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, the hon.

In fact, that is one of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  why  later on you will find  that  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  for further office accommodation. The  vote\r\n\r\ndoes, of course, include the cost of providing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntelephones  for  officers' quarters.  The  vote  is\r\n\r\ndivided   between   the   cost   of   paying    the\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  for  the  telephones  both  in   the\r\n\r\noffices  and in the quarters, and for the  cost  of\r\n\r\nmaking   trunk  calls;  and  I  myself   am   quite\r\n\r\nunrepentant about the size of this vote.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nmy  difficulty usually is to persuade the  Treasury\r\n\r\nto  allow  me  to  have more money for  telephones,\r\n\r\nbecause  personally I am a firm believer in  making\r\n\r\nthe  utmost  possible use of the modern methods  of\r\n\r\ndoing business. It may have been all very well many\r\n\r\nyears  ago  if  you  wanted  to  communicate   with\r\n\r\nsomebody  you  called  up a  messenger  who  walked\r\n\r\nquietly across and waited for a couple of hours and\r\n\r\nthen brought back an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these days, when we have a more advanced form\r\n\r\nof  constitution, my experience is that answers are\r\n\r\nwanted  a  great deal more quickly; and I  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  at  all  that  it  does  lead  to  increased\r\n\r\nefficiency  and  speed  of  public  business  if  a\r\n\r\ntelephone is used, and the more use is made of  the\r\n\r\ntelephone,  the quicker the business is despatched.\r\n\r\nNor  am  I  in the least bit apologetic for  having\r\n\r\ntelephones  in  officers' quarters.  My  experience\r\n\r\nduring  the  last year or two has been that  office\r\n\r\nhours  mean  little indeed and that it  is  vitally\r\n\r\nimportant  to  be able to get hold  of  all  senior\r\n\r\nofficers at all times of the day and, I am sorry to\r\n\r\nsay,  on  several occasions at night, and having  a\r\n\r\ntelephone  in  their quarters has  been  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary.  For  those officers  who  do  not  have\r\n\r\ntelephones in their quarters, my view is that  they\r\n\r\nshould  have  telephones.

Sir, in 1952 I moved a motion  on\r\n\r\nMalayanisation which was passed, and  if  note  had\r\n\r\nbeen  taken of this and if the Government  had  any\r\n\r\nwish  to malayanise the Department of Broadcasting,\r\n\r\nthey could have then and there selected a few local\r\n\r\nborn   officers   for  training.  But   they   have\r\n\r\ncompletely  ignored  my motion  on  Malayanisation.\r\n\r\nThis  Department  today is full of  expatriates.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand only one Asian has been appointed to  an\r\n\r\nadministrative  post,  and  that  too  he  is  only\r\n\r\nacting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, Sir, this Department of Broadcasting in\r\n\r\nsome  Commonwealth  countries - I  name  Ceylon   and\r\n\r\nIndia -   is  run  on  a  commercial  basis   as   a\r\n\r\ncorporation  and  it makes money. I  would  suggest\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  an expert to run our Department  of\r\n\r\nBroadcasting so that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  can  make money. Today we are spending on  this\r\n\r\nDepartment  over  $3,000,000 and  we  get  back  as\r\n\r\nrevenue,   in  the  form  of  Broadcast  Listeners'\r\n\r\nLicence fees, only $1,115,000. We may be getting  a\r\n\r\nportion of money from the Federation, but,  on  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  we are losing a lot. Why should we lose  at\r\n\r\nall?  The  argument of the Government  is  that  it\r\n\r\nshould come under Government control, otherwise  it\r\n\r\nmight do something which might harm Government.  If\r\n\r\nit  is conceded Government can put in as one of the\r\n\r\nconditions,  that if the Department  is  run  as  a\r\n\r\ncorporation by a commercial concern, as is done  in\r\n\r\nother countries, then the Government should have  a\r\n\r\nnominee  on  the  Board  of Directors  in  deciding\r\n\r\npolicy  and other matters. Even the Government  can\r\n\r\nuse  it  by  paying fees, which may be very  little\r\n\r\nbecause  matters  of  public  importance  will   be\r\n\r\ndefinitely broadcast.

From January  to  August\r\n\r\n1956  we  imported 89,551 sets and  exported  8,462\r\n\r\nsets - a  difference  of 81,089 sets.  The  total  of\r\n\r\nthese  sets  comes  to 167,759  sets  and  yet  the\r\n\r\nBroadcast Listeners' Licence fees collected in 1955\r\n\r\nwas  $895,000, and in 1956 the fees collected  came\r\n\r\nto $1,000,000. There is a difference of $105,000 in\r\n\r\nlicence fees collected, which is equivalent - at  $12\r\n\r\nper  annum  for  a  set - to  8,750  sets.  That   is\r\n\r\nnonsense.

It is true that had Government  been\r\n\r\nsincere  about Malayanisation, the staffing problem\r\n\r\nwould  have  been different; but you  cannot  blame\r\n\r\nRadio   Malaya  for  the  insincerity  of  colonial\r\n\r\nofficials'  assertions, that they are  desirous  of\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the colonial people and desirous  of\r\n\r\nassisting  loyally in Malayanisation.  That  is  no\r\n\r\nfault  of Radio Malaya and the blame should not  be\r\n\r\nput  at  the door of those who, though expatriates,\r\n\r\nare  seeking  to  do a good job in that  particular\r\n\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer made a sweeping\r\n\r\ndramatic  statement  about the white  elephant  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  ride on. Sir, I would  respectfully\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  hon.  Members that if  they  knew  the\r\n\r\nbroadcasts made from the political point  of  view,\r\n\r\nthey  must recognise that there is a very conscious\r\n\r\neffort   at  impartiality.  There  is  no  question\r\n\r\nwhatsoever but that the Chief Secretary has control\r\n\r\nover  what goes out over Radio Malaya that may have\r\n\r\na  political aspect and I have no doubt that  there\r\n\r\nare certain directions in this matter; but I do not\r\n\r\nthink that, by and large, we can say that there  is\r\n\r\nany  grave  abuse of that power. I am not conscious\r\n\r\nof  such abuse at all. It is true that we may be in\r\n\r\na  happier  position to have an  organisation  with\r\n\r\nsuch  tremendous  influence over the  public  as  a\r\n\r\nradio under impartial control and not under control\r\n\r\nthat  might at times take a political party aspect.\r\n\r\nSir, that is a question that should be studied  and\r\n\r\nit  may well be a question for a motion before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly; but to suggest that we scrap Radio Malaya\r\n\r\nbecause it is filled with expatriates or because it\r\n\r\nis  being  used  for political party or  government\r\n\r\npropaganda  is, I think, to exaggerate, beyond  the\r\n\r\nrealms  of  the  practical, defects that  might  be\r\n\r\ninherent in any government organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

However, on second  thoughts,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Telok Ayer felt he does not want  to\r\n\r\nscrap  it  after all. He merely wants to alter  the\r\n\r\nconstitution  which, no doubt, will  be  very  much\r\n\r\nmore  satisfactory for those who are interested  in\r\n\r\nthe radio business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I, first of all, deal with this question of\r\n\r\nlicence  fees, Sir? It seems to have  been  blindly\r\n\r\nassumed  that  there is a grave  shortfall  in  the\r\n\r\nlicensing of radio sets, and my impression is  that\r\n\r\nthe  House  has  been led into that belief  by  the\r\n\r\nfigures which were produced by the Member for Tiong\r\n\r\nBahru; but those figures were not, if I may say so,\r\n\r\nvery  sound. He gave figures of the radio  business\r\n\r\nshowing  imports and exports and led us to  believe\r\n\r\nthat   the   difference   between   those   figures\r\n\r\nrepresented  unlicensed radio  sets  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly the impression he gave me. I hope\r\n\r\nhon. Members will appreciate that a great number of\r\n\r\nradio  sets  which  remain  in  Malaya  go  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the licence fees for the Federation are not, of\r\n\r\ncourse, shown in our revenues. I do not accept  for\r\n\r\none  minute  that  there is this  vast  discrepancy\r\n\r\nbetween  the  number of radio sets in use  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of licence fees. I would not maintain  that\r\n\r\nthe  collection of revenue is anything like 100 per\r\n\r\ncent, but it certainly is a great deal better  than\r\n\r\nit  was. I certainly do not think that we need look\r\n\r\naround  for some scapegoat who needs to be  sacked,\r\n\r\nif I may quote the words of another hon. Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should then like to refer to the accusation\r\n\r\nthat this Department is full of expatriate officers\r\n\r\nwho  are  there  because  of  the  insincerity   of\r\n\r\ncolonial  officials' assertions. I  do  not  accept\r\n\r\neither of those statements, Sir. The Department  is\r\n\r\nnot full of expatriate officers. If you look at the\r\n\r\nDepartment,  if  you  look at  the  Report  of  the\r\n\r\nMalayanisation Commission, and if you will consider\r\n\r\nthe   figures   for   Malayanisation   which   this\r\n\r\nGovernment will shortly put before you, you will, I\r\n\r\nhope,   agree   that  those  criticisms   are   not\r\n\r\njustified. A very large number of officers from the\r\n\r\nBroadcasting   Department   have   been   sent   on\r\n\r\nscholarships for training over the past  few  years\r\n\r\nand  the  fruits  of  those scholarships  and  that\r\n\r\ntraining  are now being reaped by this  Government.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that there is a high percentage of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  officers in the Engineering  Branch  of\r\n\r\nRadio  Malaya. It is a highly technical  electrical\r\n\r\nengineering Branch and it is not easy to find local\r\n\r\npersons  with the necessary qualifications.  Again,\r\n\r\nwe  have sent local officers for training. It takes\r\n\r\na  very  long  time to produce radio  engineers  of\r\n\r\nsufficient  experience and calibre to  replace  our\r\n\r\nexisting expatriate officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, Sir, I should like now to deal with\r\n\r\nwhat  I think is the main question raised, and that\r\n\r\nis,  whether  it  is  right that  Radio  Malaya  in\r\n\r\nSingapore should remain a Government department.  I\r\n\r\nam  very  grateful to the Member for Cairnhill  for\r\n\r\nhis  tribute to the efforts which are made by those\r\n\r\nin  charge of the News Room to present an impartial\r\n\r\naccount of the news. They have been criticised, and\r\n\r\nno doubt they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndo from time to time make mistakes, but I do assure\r\n\r\nthe   House  that  the  officials  responsible  for\r\n\r\nproducing  the  news  on Radio  Malaya  do  try  to\r\n\r\nmaintain an impartial and factual approach. I think\r\n\r\nthis  is  very important, because once  your  radio\r\n\r\nloses  the reputation for being factually  correct,\r\n\r\nthen  people will not listen to its news  and  they\r\n\r\nwill  listen  to  radios from  outside  which  will\r\n\r\nprobably be far more partial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming, if I may, briefly to the main question,\r\n\r\nwhich  is,  should  it remain  a  department,  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  will  recall that in the  Address  at  the\r\n\r\nopening of this session, the Government stated,  as\r\n\r\na  matter of policy, that we were considering  this\r\n\r\nvery  problem of the future of Radio Malaya. We  do\r\n\r\nnot,  at  the moment, feel that it is necessary  to\r\n\r\nset up a committee. It is a matter on which we have\r\n\r\nto  consult  the Federation, and that  we  are  now\r\n\r\ndoing. It is not altogether a simple problem. There\r\n\r\nis, first of all, the question as to whether or not\r\n\r\nwe  should  continue  to have  a  joint  department\r\n\r\nserving both territories. Secondly, the question - if\r\n\r\nit  is  to remain a common organisation (there  are\r\n\r\nclearly  economic  advantages in that) - then  can  we\r\n\r\nhave   a   statutory   corporation   serving   both\r\n\r\nterritories? And there is the connected question on\r\n\r\nwhich I have spoken before in this House, and  that\r\n\r\nis  the question of television. Can we integrate  a\r\n\r\ntelevision  organisation with an  organisation  for\r\n\r\nRadio Malaya? As we have said in the Address,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis is a problem to which the Government is giving\r\n\r\nconsideration, and we are about to have discussions\r\n\r\nwith our colleagues from the Federation; and I hope\r\n\r\nit  will not be too long a time before we are  able\r\n\r\nto  produce a paper setting out our conclusions  as\r\n\r\nto what is the right policy. But I must, of course,\r\n\r\nemphasise that it is not a matter which we  control\r\n\r\nalone.  It is a matter in which we have to work  in\r\n\r\nstep  and  in  harmony with the Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, I am not convinced by the\r\n\r\nanswer  given  by the Hon. the Chief Secretary.

In other words, licences were granted for\r\n\r\n8,462  sets.  The answer of the Chief Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthis  is  that  a  portion of these  licences  were\r\n\r\nissued in the Federation. But, Sir, this is a  huge\r\n\r\ndifference.  We  are  short  of  money,   and   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should make an attempt to  catch  these\r\n\r\nevaders  who  have not paid licence  fees.  Revenue\r\n\r\nshould be collected. In this connection, what about\r\n\r\nthe  revenue collected in 1952, 1953 and 1954?  And\r\n\r\nyet,  Sir,  year  in  and  year  out,  the  revenue\r\n\r\ncollected remains at the figure of $1,000,000.

The fact is that  in  April\r\n\r\nlast year we were promised by the Chief Minister of\r\n\r\nthe day that the first Singapore Battalion would be\r\n\r\nin  operational existence by April 1957.  To-date,\r\n\r\nrecruitment  has not even begun.  As  I  stated  on\r\n\r\nMonday, only $2,500,000 has been allowed for  under\r\n\r\nvarious heads in the Estimates to train, equip  and\r\n\r\nofficer the 800 men. My object, Sir, in moving this\r\n\r\namendment  is  not to complain that the  sum  under\r\n\r\nthis  head is too much, but rather to query whether\r\n\r\nit  is  sufficient, if the Government is in earnest\r\n\r\nto  have a battalion with its full complement under\r\n\r\ntraining  at  the  earliest possible  moment;  what\r\n\r\nrates of pay are to be offered; how many men are to\r\n\r\nbe  recruited and at what age; what are their terms\r\n\r\nof service and prospects; and when will recruitment\r\n\r\nbegin?  I therefore ask this question to which  the\r\n\r\nHouse has the right to a full answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I can at once give the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  the  assurance which I think he seeks,  and\r\n\r\nthat is, that the Government does firmly intend  to\r\n\r\nproceed with raising this Singapore Battalion,  and\r\n\r\nwe  are  still hoping to achieve that in  the  very\r\n\r\nnear  future.  I think his disquiet  partly  arises\r\n\r\nfrom   the  figures  in  the  Estimates,  and   the\r\n\r\nexplanation  is this: that we were advised  by  the\r\n\r\nmilitary experts that we should probably need a sum\r\n\r\nof   the  order  of  $3.6  million  for  the   pay,\r\n\r\nmaintenance and equipment of the battalion, but  it\r\n\r\nis  quite evident that the battalion cannot  be  at\r\n\r\nfull  battalion strength at the very  beginning  of\r\n\r\nthis coming year, and we have therefore entered the\r\n\r\nfigures  which  appear  in the  Estimates - it  is  a\r\n\r\nmillion  dollars under the head which  we  are  now\r\n\r\ndiscussing,  I  think, and $500,000  under  another\r\n\r\nhead,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  there is a million dollars further back in the\r\n\r\nDefence  Estimates.  Those  figures,  Sir,  do  not\r\n\r\npurport to be the full cost, but they purport to be\r\n\r\nas reasonable an estimate as we can make of what we\r\n\r\nexpect  to spend. The Treasury, financially,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  Members would agree, did not wish to  include\r\n\r\nin  the  Estimates a figure which there was  little\r\n\r\nprospect of spending, thereby upsetting the balance\r\n\r\nof  the  Estimates. It is our intention to raise  a\r\n\r\nbattalion  and  we have put in the money  which  we\r\n\r\nhope  to spend. If events move faster, and we would\r\n\r\nwelcome  them  to  move faster, and  we  need  more\r\n\r\nfunds,  we  shall, of course, come  here  for  more\r\n\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, I would like\r\n\r\nto  touch  upon  the  most expensive  toy  Navy  in\r\n\r\nhistory - the Royal Malayan Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the hon. Member speaking on the\r\n\r\namendment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, I beg your pardon, no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would just like to\r\n\r\nsay  that  I  consider  that a  very  disappointing\r\n\r\nanswer. If, as I understand it, it is going to cost\r\n\r\n$3.6 million to make the battalion operational  and\r\n\r\nonly  $2\ufffd million is provided for, that means that\r\n\r\nthere  will be no Singapore battalion in  operation\r\n\r\nuntil  1958 - or  more  than a year  after  what  was\r\n\r\npromised us last April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, much depends on the meaning of\r\n\r\nthe word \"operational\". If by \"operational\" we mean\r\n\r\nby the end of the coming year we can have a regular\r\n\r\nbattalion  fully  trained in all  the  arts  of  an\r\n\r\ninfantry soldier, then, of course, the answer  must\r\n\r\nbe no. That would not be possible. I think it would\r\n\r\nprobably take at least two or three years to get  a\r\n\r\nbattalion  up  to  the  full standard  of  infantry\r\n\r\ntraining. But if by \"operational\" we only mean that\r\n\r\nby  the  end  of the year we should  have  had  our\r\n\r\nbattalion   well   established - we   hope   up    to\r\n\r\nstrength - and  completed their basic  training,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  a  formed and disciplined  body  of  men\r\n\r\nmaking good progress, then I think there is still a\r\n\r\nprospect. In that sense we might be operational.  I\r\n\r\nsay \"prospect\" advisedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question on the amendment put, and negatived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $11,168,390 for Head 12 stand part of the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, the Imperial\r\n\r\nGovernment   has   insisted   during    the    last\r\n\r\nconstitutional talks, and well before - in  fact,  it\r\n\r\nwas   conceded  freely  before  the  constitutional\r\n\r\ntalks - that it should have complete control of  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of Singapore. This was necessary, not  for\r\n\r\nthe   purposes  of  Singapore,  Sir,  but  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  the international defence commitments\r\n\r\nof the United Kingdom. That being the case, Sir, it\r\n\r\nseems  to me wholly inappropriate to call upon  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore to pay for imperial expenditure\r\n\r\nand  imperial defence services, since those defence\r\n\r\nservices are not primarily intended for the welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people  of Singapore. Sir,  we  have  been\r\n\r\nspending, and we are promised that we shall  spend,\r\n\r\nfantastic  millions  on a toy  Navy  which  has  no\r\n\r\nrelationship to our needs and which has never  been\r\n\r\nutilised  for  our  welfare. I have  sought,  by  a\r\n\r\nquestion, to elicit information as to the policy of\r\n\r\nthe  Imperial Government, necessarily not  of  this\r\n\r\nGovernment,  with  reference  to  these   matters - a\r\n\r\npolicy which could have been indicated by the Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary - and the Financial Secretary has  avoided\r\n\r\nthe  point, the question being directed to  him  on\r\n\r\nfinancial   aspects.  I  have  sought   to   obtain\r\n\r\ninformation  as  to the policy which  would  govern\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for the next five years, since  I  see\r\n\r\nthat  we  are down for $15 million for, I  believe,\r\n\r\nfour  minesweepers - and not tin  minesweepers.  They\r\n\r\nhave  nothing to do with any productive effort  and\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with  any topical  aspect  of  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of  the people of Singapore. I,  for  one,\r\n\r\nSir,  as  a citizen of this territory, deplore  the\r\n\r\nhorrible  waste of considerable sums  of  money  on\r\n\r\nthis  toy Navy, and I call upon the Chief Secretary\r\n\r\nto  give  this  country a full explanation  of  the\r\n\r\nintentions of the Imperial Government, in so far as\r\n\r\nthis Government knows them, as concern our\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpenditure   on  matters  which  do  not   concern\r\n\r\nSingapore  but concern external defence  which  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom  insists  on  retaining,  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  insist  on  retaining,  and  in  fact\r\n\r\nretains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman,  Sir, I fully agree with the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  who has just spoken on the Royal  Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy.  It  has  been admitted many  times  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  Sir,  that  Singapore is  still  a  British\r\n\r\ncolony. As such, matters of external defence should\r\n\r\nbe  borne  by Her Majesty's Government.  I  see  no\r\n\r\njustification  that  salaries  and  allowances  for\r\n\r\nofficers  on  loan  from  the  Royal  Navy  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government should be met by the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment and not by the British Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.36 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am somewhat\r\n\r\nsurprised! I thought I should get much  more  of  a\r\n\r\nthrashing  from the Member for Cairnhill  over  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Battalion than over  the  Royal  Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy.  Life  is full of surprises! The hon.  Member\r\n\r\nused  some hard words about the Royal Malayan Navy,\r\n\r\ncalling  it  \"a toy Navy\" and a waste of  fantastic\r\n\r\nmillions, suggesting that it is never utilised  for\r\n\r\nour  welfare,  and  that he deplored  its  horrible\r\n\r\nwaste.   Sir,  it  can  well  be  said   that   all\r\n\r\nexpenditure on military forces is a horrible waste,\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately we still live in times when it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to spend money on those forces. While, of\r\n\r\ncourse,   they  are  unproductive,  they   do   add\r\n\r\nsomething, I think, to the sum of human values; and\r\n\r\nthat  is, when you create an organisation  such  as\r\n\r\nthe  Royal  Malayan  Navy and in  this  interest  a\r\n\r\nnumber of young men, you do produce something  that\r\n\r\ngoes beyond the men, goes beyond the buildings, and\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond the weapons or the ships they may use.\r\n\r\nAnd  the Royal Malayan Navy, in its short life, has\r\n\r\nalready produced something for which alone much  of\r\n\r\nthe expenditure would have been worthwhile. That is\r\n\r\na  sense of service and a sense of belonging to  an\r\n\r\norganisation  in which you can have  pride  and  in\r\n\r\nwhich I hope your country can have pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am asked by the Member or Cairnhill\r\n\r\nto  state the intentions of he Imperial Government.\r\n\r\nI  have  no brief, Sir, to speak on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nImperial Government, nor indeed do I think that the\r\n\r\nintentions  of the Imperial government really  come\r\n\r\ninto this issue at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of taking up some of your time, I\r\n\r\nshould like to put the Royal Malayan Navy into  its\r\n\r\nproper  historical background, and  I  will  start,\r\n\r\nSir,  with  the time in 1939, 1940, 1941  and  1942\r\n\r\nwhen  war was very close to Singapore but  not  yet\r\n\r\nupon  us,  and when our friends were far  away  and\r\n\r\nheavily  committed and could do little for  us.  At\r\n\r\nthat  time,  Sir, the waters of this great  seaport\r\n\r\nwere  kept safe for the ships of the world to  come\r\n\r\nand go, for our life-blood to continue to flow,  by\r\n\r\na  comparatively  small number of  young  men  from\r\n\r\nSingapore  and the Federation who were prepared  to\r\n\r\nman  small  ships, referred to scathingly  as  \"toy\r\n\r\nships\", \"tin-ships\". They were not very big  ships.\r\n\r\nBut  those men performed a very vital function here\r\n\r\nin sweeping the mines and ensuring that, regardless\r\n\r\nof  what happened on the main battlefields  of  the\r\n\r\nglobal war, Singapore's life could still go on.  It\r\n\r\nwas  very  much on the tradition of that  Singapore\r\n\r\nNaval  Volunteer Force that a small  Malayan  naval\r\n\r\nunit  was  formed during the war  by  a  number  of\r\n\r\npeople who had succeeded in making their escape and\r\n\r\nwho also served throughout the whole of the rest of\r\n\r\nthe  war  while  many  of  us  were  prevented   by\r\n\r\ncircumstances  from  doing anything;  and  on  that\r\n\r\ntradition, on that small nucleus, the Royal Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy has been built up to what it is today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background of building up the Royal Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy was the background of an agreed policy between\r\n\r\nthe  two Governments - the Federation (or the Malayan\r\n\r\nUnion, as it may have been) and Singapore. While it\r\n\r\nis  quite  true - I will anticipate the  point  which\r\n\r\nwill be made - that in those days the Government  was\r\n\r\nrun by the colonial officials who decided precisely\r\n\r\nwhat  these  two Governments would do, (that  is  a\r\n\r\ncriticism that people can make), I do not think  it\r\n\r\nholds any water at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause, in fact, moneys for these services had  to\r\n\r\nbe  voted through the Legislative Councils; and the\r\n\r\ncolonial officials, however much they might want to\r\n\r\n\"oppress\" the people of Singapore, could not do  it\r\n\r\nunless  they  were able to persuade the  unofficial\r\n\r\nmajority to vote the moneys through. Anyway, it was\r\n\r\ndecided,   as  a  matter  of  pan-Malayan   defence\r\n\r\norganisation, that these two territories  would  do\r\n\r\nsomething to contribute towards their own  defence.\r\n\r\nIt  was also decided, with the full concurrence and\r\n\r\nagreement  of  the  then  representatives  of   the\r\n\r\npeople - some of them elected - that the most practical\r\n\r\nand  efficient way of doing that was for Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich,  as  I  say,  had  already  this  very  fine\r\n\r\ntradition of a Navy and which had on the island the\r\n\r\nbig  resources of the Royal Naval Base, to shoulder\r\n\r\nthe  task  of providing a Royal Malayan Navy - not  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Navy, but a Royal Malayan  Navy - for  the\r\n\r\nwhole of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Federation Government\r\n\r\nundertook  to  develop the Army side.  There  again\r\n\r\nthat  seems  to  me to have been  a  very  sensible\r\n\r\ndecision.   The   Federation  had  this   wonderful\r\n\r\ntradition of the Malay Regiment, two battalions  of\r\n\r\nwhich  took  part  in  the  fighting  against   the\r\n\r\nJapanese,  and  the  First  Battalion,   I   think,\r\n\r\ndistinguished itself then as highly  as  any  other\r\n\r\nbattalion  during  the  Malayan  campaign.  So  the\r\n\r\nFederation had the tradition of the Malay Regiment.\r\n\r\nThey  had  the manpower, and they said  they  would\r\n\r\nundertake to build up the infantry forces.  And  it\r\n\r\nwas  on  that  basis that the plans were  made  and\r\n\r\nmoneys were voted by the two Councils over a period\r\n\r\nof   years  which  led  to  the  creation  of  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable military forces by the Federation, and\r\n\r\nof  this very fine little Royal Malayan Navy  which\r\n\r\nwas supported by Singapore. The whole basis of that\r\n\r\nwas  the  pooling of interests, a joint effort  for\r\n\r\nthe  common good, and it was not suggested that the\r\n\r\nfunctions  and the size of the Royal  Malayan  Navy\r\n\r\nshould  be limited only by the area of water around\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or that the military forces  raised  in\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  should  be  limited   purely   to\r\n\r\nFederation needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now, of course, moved into a\r\n\r\ndifferent set of circumstances where the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment   is   rapidly   moving   towards   full\r\n\r\nindependence and we in Singapore are moving towards\r\n\r\nan  interim stage. So the question now is  whether,\r\n\r\nunder  the  new constitutional circumstances  which\r\n\r\nwill   exist  next  year,  these  plans  and  these\r\n\r\narrangements  are  still sound. That  is  a  matter\r\n\r\nwhich   we   are  discussing  with  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and I think I can say  at  this  stage\r\n\r\nthat the indications are that while we in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  already  decided that we must build  up  some\r\n\r\nmilitary force - at least one battalion, and possibly\r\n\r\ntwo   battalions  of  soldiers  here - similarly  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government have come to the  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat they must build up a naval force and not leave\r\n\r\nit entirely to Singapore. It would seem, therefore,\r\n\r\nat  first sight that the two Governments are moving\r\n\r\non  lines which will complement each other in  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government, I think, wish to accept\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for the naval  force,  and  to  the\r\n\r\nextent  that they do that, we shall be relieved  of\r\n\r\nthat  part  of the pan Malayan share.  We,  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  are wishing to put our  money  rather\r\n\r\ninto  a  battalion of troops than into ships.  What\r\n\r\ndecisions we shall finally reach I cannot yet  say,\r\n\r\nbut  I hope that the conversations which we are  to\r\n\r\nhave  in  the near future will enable us  to  reach\r\n\r\nagreement  on  broad policy; and in  the  light  of\r\n\r\nthat,  we  shall be able to consider  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhat to do for our future naval commitments. It  is\r\n\r\nbecause this problem is still under discussion  and\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have not yet reached firm  conclusions\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  not able, unfortunately, to  give  the\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill what he would like - which is  a\r\n\r\nfirm  statement of what we propose to  do  for  the\r\n\r\nnaval  force  of Singapore and what we  propose  to\r\n\r\nspend on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add, I think, one last point, and\r\n\r\nthat is that in putting our minds to the problem of\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a  military  force,  do  not  let  us\r\n\r\naltogether overlook the fact that Singapore is  one\r\n\r\nof  the major seaports of the world, that our  life\r\n\r\ndoes depend on the freedom\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof ships coming and going, and that in time of war,\r\n\r\nwhen  people drop mines, it is only by having  some\r\n\r\nsmall  ships  which would keep your sealanes  clear\r\n\r\nthat  you will get your ships in and out.  I  think\r\n\r\nthere is a certain minimum commitment for Singapore\r\n\r\nto  safeguard its own front door, as it were, which\r\n\r\nshould not be overlooked, viewing the Royal Malayan\r\n\r\nNavy  through pan-Malayan eyes. I am sorry  that  I\r\n\r\ncannot  give  a firm assurance as to  what  we  are\r\n\r\ngoing  to do and I have no doubt that this question\r\n\r\nwill  come  up  again when we are  dealing  with  a\r\n\r\ndevelopment  head  for capital expenditure,  and  I\r\n\r\nthink I will not say any more on that till we  come\r\n\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Chairman, I am\r\n\r\nsure  both  sides  of the House have  been  greatly\r\n\r\nimpressed  by the strong nationalist feeling  shown\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Cairnhill in connection with the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Malayan  Navy. We have also to  express  our\r\n\r\nappreciation of the detailed explanation  from  the\r\n\r\nHon. the Chief Secretary on the Royal Malayan Navy.\r\n\r\nBut,  Sir,  one main question which both  sides  of\r\n\r\nthis  House have not touched is whether there is  a\r\n\r\npossibility  of  any enemy invading  this  country.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we must be prepared to spend  a  certain\r\n\r\namount  of  money on defence expenditure.  Sir,  at\r\n\r\nthis juncture, I must pay a tribute to the Hon. the\r\n\r\nChief Minister of the Federation of Malaya when  he\r\n\r\ndecided   that  the  Federation  of   Malaya   will\r\n\r\ndefinitely  not  join  the  S.E.A.T.O. pact.  Sir,\r\n\r\nalthough it looks as if many people have overlooked\r\n\r\nit, yet to me this decision of the Federation Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  carries a very important significance  of\r\n\r\nan independent administrative policy as regards the\r\n\r\nfuture  of this territory. We have to bear in  mind\r\n\r\nthe spirit that has been brought about by the Asian-African  Conference, and the circumstances  of  the\r\n\r\nworld  today when, at this juncture, we  debate  on\r\n\r\nwhether  or not to spend our hard earned  money  on\r\n\r\nbuilding  up  a  Navy - as the  Chief  Secretary  has\r\n\r\nexplained,  a  minesweeper that will  protect  this\r\n\r\nterritory  or  render certain conveniences  to  our\r\n\r\ngreat seaport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Four minesweepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> But, Sir, I am reminded that\r\n\r\nalthough  our  Malayan coast was protected  by  two\r\n\r\ngreat  fighting ships - the Prince of Wales  and  the\r\n\r\nRepulse - during  the  last war, yet  this  territory\r\n\r\nfell  into  enemy hands. Even though Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe Federation of Malaya may pool their revenue,  I\r\n\r\nwonder  whether  they  can  afford  to  build  many\r\n\r\nbattleships. I am sure hon. Members in  this  House\r\n\r\nwill  agree with me that we cannot afford to  build\r\n\r\neven one. Therefore, to build up a Malayan Navy  to\r\n\r\ndefend  this  coast is, to me, not only unnecessary\r\n\r\nbut a mockery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which strikes me and all political\r\n\r\nParties in this colony is that the supreme power in\r\n\r\nthis   territory  still  lies  with   the   British\r\n\r\nGovernment. Furthermore, in view of the  fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  constitutions of Singapore and the  Federation\r\n\r\nare  in  the  hands of the British  Government,  we\r\n\r\nagree that external defence should rest solely with\r\n\r\nthe   British   Government.  Therefore,   at   this\r\n\r\njuncture,  I  do  not think it is any  use  talking\r\n\r\nabout building a Royal Malayan Navy. Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nput   an   alternative  suggestion  to  the   Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  for  his  consideration,  and  that  is,\r\n\r\nwhether it is possible to hold up this issue  until\r\n\r\nSingapore becomes a State and not still a colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

I want to draw the attention  of\r\n\r\nthe Government to the type of films which are shown\r\n\r\nin  the  colony. On the whole, they do not tend  to\r\n\r\nmake  people  work in the direction of obeying  law\r\n\r\nand  order  or  of getting them to work  harder  at\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs. Rather these films work in  the  wrong\r\n\r\ndirection  in  that they incite  people  to  commit\r\n\r\ncrime  where they did not know how to do it before!\r\n\r\nI am aware of a number of films which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshow  techniques employed by gangsters and robbers.\r\n\r\nThese  techniques hitherto have not been  known  to\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore, although probably they are\r\n\r\nknown  in Chicago. I would recommend that the Board\r\n\r\nof  Film  Censors take note of such things so  that\r\n\r\nany  film, which tends to lower the morals  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore or gives them a better idea  of\r\n\r\nhow to commit crimes and get away with them, should\r\n\r\nbe  censored  to a greater extent. Furthermore,  we\r\n\r\nhave  our  local  film industry coming  up  and  it\r\n\r\nshould receive more encouragement, bearing in  mind\r\n\r\nalso  the  film  import tax in  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> I very much share the views expressed\r\n\r\nby  the Member for Serangoon, Sir, that the general\r\n\r\nstandard  of the films shown is not all that  could\r\n\r\nbe  desired. The question is how far by  censorship\r\n\r\nwe   can  improve  it.  Censorship  is  a  somewhat\r\n\r\ndifficult  subject.  The  position  in   the   Film\r\n\r\nCensor's Office, as the hon. Member knows, is  that\r\n\r\nwe have two or three persons who view the films and\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  or not they can  be  passed.  Then\r\n\r\nthere is an Appeal Board which consists of a number\r\n\r\nof,  I  hope, representative citizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  we  ask the Film Censor to tighten up  a  great\r\n\r\ndeal  on the ordinary run of films that come in,  I\r\r\n\r\nthink you will find that there will be a great many\r\n\r\nappeals before the Appeal Board, and I am not  sure\r\n\r\nhow  far  the Appeal Board would be able to sustain\r\n\r\nthe  Film  Censor. But I am sure the remarks  which\r\n\r\nhave  been made will not be lost on those  who  are\r\n\r\nresponsible   for  taking  these   very   difficult\r\n\r\ndecisions as to what films to allow in and how  far\r\n\r\nit  is  possible to make cuts in the  film  without\r\n\r\ncompletely ruining it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $20l,040 for Head 13 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 14-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $546,780 for Head 14 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 15-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in\r\n\r\nrespect of sub-head 1 (1) , Director of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation Services, Grade F, on page  94  of  the\r\n\r\nEstimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mr Lee Kuan Yew's absence, the amendment was not proceeded with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Chairman, I beg to move the\r\n\r\namendment standing in my name, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce by $10 the sum to be allotted in\r\n\r\nrespect of sub-head 11, Tourist Promotion, on  page\r\n\r\n96 of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since I spoke on the subject of tourist\r\n\r\npromotion this time last year, I am glad  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has made some progress in this matter in\r\n\r\nthe  past 12 months. A Working Party was set up  to\r\n\r\ngo into the problem of starting a tourist bureau in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and one of its recommendations was  that\r\n\r\nan   expert  in  tourism  be  invited  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore   and   make   an  examination   of   the\r\n\r\npossibilities.  An expert from New Zealand  is  now\r\n\r\nhere, I believe, and he has made his report. It  is\r\n\r\nto  be  hoped  that the Government  will  now  take\r\n\r\nanother  step forward and follow through  with  his\r\n\r\nrecommendations  in so far as they  prove  suitable\r\n\r\nand to use his advice, while he is here, to get the\r\n\r\nbureau started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would ask Members of this House to realise\r\n\r\nthat,  when talking about tourism, you are  talking\r\n\r\nof  an  industry - the tourist industry - and Singapore\r\n\r\nis  not  so rich as to be able to afford to neglect\r\n\r\nany  form  of  industry which will be  of  economic\r\n\r\nbenefit.  Countries  like  Japan  and  Hawaii  have\r\n\r\nbenefited   enormously.  Japan  last  year   earned\r\n\r\n$45,400,000 from tourists; Hawaii $16 million;  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  no reason why we should not do something\r\n\r\nof  the same sort. Our attractions, to mention some\r\n\r\nof the more obvious ones which our visitors comment\r\n\r\non,    are   our   multiracial   friendliness   and\r\n\r\ncolourfulness, our variety of foods,  our  tropical\r\n\r\nfruits  and  fish and orchids, our housing  schemes\r\n\r\nand our clinics. Our people must be educated to  be\r\n\r\ntourist-conscious so that they are  more  aware  of\r\n\r\nthe  benefits  which  it  can  bring  and  so  that\r\n\r\nvisitors  can be persuaded to stay on for a  longer\r\n\r\nperiod.  We have much in Singapore to be  proud  of\r\n\r\nand much to show those who stay here, and I am not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsure  that  we always realise this fact. I  repeat,\r\n\r\nSir,  Singapore  has  so few indigenous  industries\r\n\r\nthat the Government must go all out to develop  the\r\n\r\ntourist  industry and to enlist the co-operation  of\r\n\r\nthe  commercial concerns such as the shipping lines\r\n\r\nand  the airlines and so on. I hope that the  small\r\n\r\namount  done in last year will be largely increased\r\n\r\nin  the  coming year, and my object in moving  this\r\n\r\namendment is to draw attention to the fact that the\r\n\r\namount  of $20,000 under this head, although double\r\n\r\nthe  amount allotted last year, is not too much but\r\n\r\ntoo  little,  and  from  the explanatory  note,  it\r\n\r\nappears that the money is to be spent on literature\r\n\r\nand  not  on the tourist bureau, where the tourists\r\n\r\nstart.   The  literature  put  up  by  the   Public\r\n\r\nRelations  Office, to my mind, is not  particularly\r\n\r\nattractive.  I would say that the visitor  is  more\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  attracted  to  Singapore  and   the\r\n\r\nFederation by the Straits Times Annual than by  the\r\n\r\nBusinessman's  Guide. The reason is no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nthe  Public Relations Office is not best suited  to\r\n\r\nprovide  this  type  of thing and  that  a  tourist\r\n\r\nexpert is needed to carry out this kind of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the Chief Secretary will tell us what\r\n\r\nplans  are being made for the future and will  give\r\n\r\nus  the  assurance that the Government  intends  to\r\n\r\ntake  the tourist industry very seriously so as  to\r\n\r\nimprove and increase our national income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

I always say that  we  have  no\r\n\r\nnatural  resources and we have to develop something\r\n\r\nwhich   can  give  us  more  revenue.  The  tourist\r\n\r\nindustry is one of the best forms to get revenue in\r\n\r\nthe  sense  that Singapore is the centre of  South-\r\n\r\nEast Asia. It is a very important port of call  for\r\n\r\nsteamers,   aeroplanes   and   other    means    of\r\n\r\ncommunication.  The  tourist industry  is  an  idea\r\n\r\nwhich  we got from E.C.A.F.E. many years ago, but\r\n\r\nunfortunately  it has not been developed.  Although\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a small city, we can, if we publicise\r\n\r\nit well, keep the tourists' stay here longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  can the Federation if it does the same.

If Singapore  is  well\r\n\r\nadvertised, Sir, we may be able to draw  a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntourists  here. But, Sir, may I draw the  attention\r\n\r\nof  a certain section of this House to the fact the\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  being  well  advertised  in  another\r\n\r\nway - by the riots and the troubles that we have had?\r\n\r\nThat  kind  of advertisement, Sir, is  not  to  our\r\n\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> If it please you, Sir, it is a\r\n\r\ndelightful if somewhat foreign feeling to  be  able\r\n\r\nto  say that I agree with everything that everybody\r\n\r\nhas  said! I do, Sir, and I would only like to  add\r\n\r\nthis  as a contribution to the debate: One  of  the\r\n\r\nmain obstacles to the development of Singapore as a\r\n\r\ntourist  centre is the limited and expensive  hotel\r\n\r\naccommodation. Sir, compared to any other  city  in\r\n\r\nany other country, it is extraordinary that in this\r\n\r\nterritory  we cannot get hotel accommodation  of  a\r\n\r\ncharacter  demanded  by  the  tourists,  but  at  a\r\n\r\nreasonable figure. We have hotels for the very rich\r\n\r\nand we have hotels for the lower income groups, but\r\n\r\nwe  have  no  hotels for the type of  tourists  who\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  visit  Singapore - for  instance,  a\r\n\r\nschool  teacher  or  a clerk from  the  territories\r\n\r\naround  us. I was looking forward to Merdeka Bridge\r\n\r\nand  Merdeka Highway, because I was hoping  that  a\r\n\r\nsite would then be made available - and a site is now\r\n\r\navailable,  a wonderful site for a hotel.  A  large\r\n\r\nhotel can be built on this site to accommodate  300\r\n\r\nto 500 people on the seaside. This\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  an unusual request, Sir, but since we failed to\r\n\r\ninterest  local  capital and  foreign  capital  (an\r\n\r\nAmerican group) in putting up a hotel at a moderate\r\n\r\nprice,  I  would  ask whether the Government  would\r\n\r\nconsider  the  question of putting  up  a  building\r\n\r\nwhich  it could then lease out to be managed  as  a\r\n\r\nhotel at very reasonable rates per day. That would,\r\n\r\nin  my  opinion, go a very long way towards helping\r\n\r\nSingapore became a tourist centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Sir I have\r\n\r\njust  one  comment  to make in reply  to  the  very\r\n\r\ninteresting  suggestion put forward by  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill.  The  Nicoll  Highway  and  Merdeka\r\n\r\nBridge   area  is  not  suitable  for  very   large\r\n\r\nbuildings  unless you are prepared to put  in  very\r\n\r\nlong  piles and sink a great deal of money  in  the\r\n\r\nfoundations. We had 160-foot piles under  parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  bridge.  Well,  that adds enormously  to  your\r\n\r\ncapital  investment, and consequently a hotel  with\r\n\r\nthat  length of pile underneath it would require  a\r\n\r\nvery high tariff from those people who make use  of\r\n\r\nit  and would be very much of a luxury hotel.  That\r\n\r\nis  a matter for very careful thought. To put up  a\r\n\r\nmiddle-class or a lower-middle-class hotel, I think\r\n\r\nyour site would have to be elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  a  warm  climate which is very  attractive  to\r\n\r\npeople in Europe. We also have palm trees and  blue\r\n\r\nskies,  but all these things can also be  found  in\r\n\r\nHawaii  and Ceylon and Djakarta and elsewhere.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are some things that Singapore can boast  of\r\n\r\nwhich  other places cannot, and these are the  many\r\n\r\nraces living here and the many cultures flourishing\r\n\r\naround us. In effect, Sir, I am suggesting that  if\r\n\r\nwe are to ask our Information Services to publicise\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  must  have materials  for  them  to\r\n\r\npublicise.   We  must  build  up   some   sort   of\r\n\r\nspeciality,  which  will be a real  attraction  for\r\n\r\ntourists.  In  Singapore we have  quite  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nreligious   and   traditional   ceremonies.   These\r\n\r\nemanated from India and other places many years ago\r\n\r\nbut  are now no more followed in those lands.  They\r\n\r\nare however still practised here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe  have  also  music  of many  varieties -  Indian,\r\n\r\nChinese,   Malay, etc.  All  these   things   need\r\n\r\nencouragement.  It  is not just  the  work  of  the\r\n\r\nInformation Services. They have also to  work  with\r\n\r\nthe  police, so that the latter can issue them with\r\n\r\nthe necessary permits to carry out these things. We\r\n\r\nwill   then  have  something  for  the  Information\r\n\r\nServices   who  will  be  able  to  make  Singapore\r\n\r\nattractive to the tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, naturally I am gratified to find\r\n\r\non  both  sides  of the House so much  support  for\r\n\r\nfurther  expenditure on the promotion of a  tourist\r\n\r\nindustry  in  Singapore.

Member's request, I must\r\n\r\nhold then that the vote which was taken on the main\r\n\r\nHead   was  invalidated  and  therefore  the  whole\r\n\r\nQuestion is now reopened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My recollection is, I think, that we have another\r\n\r\n15 minutes on that Head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.32 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I think\r\n\r\nboth sides of the House are aware that although the\r\n\r\nInformation  Services seems to be a new department,\r\n\r\nit  is,  in  fact, a change in name only  from  the\r\n\r\nPublic Relations Office, and therefore we can trace\r\n\r\nthe  amount of work between the Government and  the\r\n\r\npeople, especially on the information side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to the House that I, for one,\r\n\r\nam  very unhappy about the duties performed by  the\r\n\r\nthen  Public Relations Office I have no doubt  that\r\n\r\nmany  officers in that Office have tried their best\r\n\r\nto  perform an efficient service but there is still\r\n\r\na tendency for this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice to neglect its duty of informing the public.\r\n\r\nIn  particular, the non-English-speaking public  are\r\n\r\nnot provided with the information to which they are\r\n\r\nentitled. I think this is the right and proper time\r\n\r\nfor  Government to adopt a new approach towards our\r\n\r\npeople, most of whom are illiterate and not  civic-minded.  As one of the functions of the Information\r\n\r\nServices,  many hundreds of pictures  of  Ministers\r\n\r\nperforming   opening   ceremonies   or   delivering\r\n\r\nspeeches  have  been  circulated.  Sir,  I  am  not\r\n\r\nopposing  this function of the Information Services\r\n\r\nto  inform the public that such and such a Minister\r\n\r\nis  working  very hard or that he has visited  such\r\n\r\nand  such  a place with pictures of him circulated;\r\n\r\nbut  there are many more important functions  which\r\n\r\nthe  Information Services can perform. One of  them\r\n\r\nis  to  inform the public of the current  state  of\r\n\r\naffairs in Singapore of which I am sure the  public\r\n\r\nare ill-informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to remind the Government\r\n\r\nto  utilise fully the facilities which they possess\r\n\r\nin  the  Information Services, and  not  only  give\r\n\r\ninformation  but,  at the same  time,  educate  the\r\n\r\npeople properly. The debate now is on taxation  but\r\n\r\nI  wonder  how  many citizens in Singapore  realise\r\n\r\nthat  taxation is necessary if every citizen  wants\r\n\r\nto benefit socially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month's rioting, a most regrettable\r\n\r\nincident, will, I hope, wake the Government  up  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the public have been misinformed  in\r\n\r\nmany,  many things. It is very important  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should bear the responsibility  of  not\r\n\r\nonly  informing the public, if possible,  of  every\r\n\r\ndetail that passes but also of educating our people\r\n\r\nand  making sure that the Information Services will\r\n\r\nnot be an instrument merely to serve the Government\r\n\r\nand not the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I do not think that any of us on\r\n\r\nthis  side  of  the  House  would  profess  to   be\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the extent to which our Information\r\n\r\nServices  succeed  in reaching  the  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. We are fully conscious, Sir, of the need\r\n\r\nto do a great deal more and, in particular, of this\r\n\r\ndifficulty of reaching the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon-English speaking sections of the population and\r\n\r\nthe  sections of the population which have had less\r\n\r\nadvantage of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill (Mr Marshall), speaking\r\n\r\na few days ago, rightly pointed out that one of the\r\n\r\nbasic  problems that has to be solved  here  is  to\r\n\r\ndraw   the   two   sections   of   the   population\r\n\r\ntogether - those who can speak and understand English\r\n\r\nand those who cannot. I do accept - and I am sure  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  would wish me to accept - the  criticism\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  hon. Member that we  are  not  doing\r\n\r\nenough. We are trying to do what we can. Perhaps  I\r\n\r\ncould  say as a slight token of what has been  done\r\n\r\nthat we have strengthened during the past year what\r\n\r\nI  now call the Chinese-speaking staff in the  what\r\n\r\nwas  then  the  Public Relations Office.  We  were,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  through  other  demands,  short  of\r\n\r\nstaff  in the Public Relations Office through  most\r\n\r\nof this year. I hope that we shall be able to bring\r\n\r\nthat  staff  back up to full strength  and  we  are\r\n\r\nfully  conscious of the importance of strengthening\r\n\r\nthose  who can speak and read Chinese and who  will\r\n\r\nknow  how to so present material that it will reach\r\n\r\nhome to those sections of our population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing I would add, Sir, and that is\r\n\r\nthat  we  do,  at  this  very  moment,  have  under\r\n\r\nconsideration   proposals  for  strengthening   and\r\n\r\nenlarging  this  department now to  be  called  the\r\n\r\nDepartment of Information Services. It is my regret\r\n\r\nthat those proposals were not completed in time  to\r\n\r\nbe   included  in  the  Estimates  now  before  the\r\n\r\nAssembly but it is my very earnest hope that  in  a\r\n\r\nsitting - perhaps  our  next sitting,  if  not  then,\r\n\r\ncertainly the first sitting in February - I  hope  to\r\n\r\ncome  to  this  Assembly for  an  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision   for   the   Information   Services   to\r\n\r\nstrengthen us and to do a little more than  we  are\r\n\r\ndoing  now  to  meet  the  criticism  which,  quite\r\n\r\nrightly, has been expressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $679,310 for Head 15 ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 16-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the sum of $25,373,140 for Head 16 stand part of the Schedule.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, whenever\r\n\r\nthe  word  \"Police\" is mentioned to the Public,  it\r\n\r\ngives  them  a  picture of  a  force  that  is  not\r\n\r\nfriendly and finds fault with the people, and of  a\r\n\r\nforce that seems always to look at things the wrong\r\n\r\nway. I am certain, Sir, that this is due mainly  to\r\n\r\nthe  arrangement of the police in  stations.  As  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  fact, we find that in police  stations,\r\n\r\nthe   business  that  is  transacted  is  not  only\r\n\r\nconfined  to crime but also related to such  things\r\n\r\nas registration of births and deaths, the obtaining\r\n\r\nof  a  permit for a procession, and so on. However,\r\n\r\nwhenever  a  person  goes to register  his  child's\r\n\r\nbirth,  he is usually being given a treat also,  to\r\n\r\nother aspects of police work. I would say that that\r\n\r\naspect  of  the  business  does  not  help  him  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the work of the police too much. Lately,\r\n\r\nI have seen some improvements in this direction and\r\n\r\nI  have  seen  that in police stations,  they  have\r\n\r\ntried  to  separate the two things - crime  from  the\r\n\r\nordinary  business  of the day - instead  of  having\r\n\r\neverything done on a long counter. But it  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen done sufficiently. I think that the separation\r\n\r\nshould be complete so that the people who go  along\r\n\r\non  their lawful business should feel confident  of\r\n\r\nwalking into a police station and having their work\r\n\r\ndone  in a cordial manner and in an atmosphere that\r\n\r\nis  almost like an office. One suggestion  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  make, Sir, is that, instead of  having  a\r\n\r\npoliceman  in  uniform, he might very  well  be  in\r\n\r\nmufti to deal with non-criminal matters. That would\r\n\r\nprobably  help  the  people,  who  would  be   less\r\n\r\nreluctant to go into a police station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point, of course, Sir, is that the\r\n\r\ntrouble  today  would have been less  if  everybody\r\n\r\ncould  treat the policeman as a friend and walk  up\r\n\r\nto  him  and  ask him to solve their  difficulties.\r\n\r\nThen  probably, you will find that  there  will  be\r\n\r\nless hatred. This, of course, cannot be achieved in\r\n\r\na day or in a few months. It will probably take one\r\n\r\nor two years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  I am certain that if the Government puts up  a\r\n\r\nscheme whereby every policeman is given a course in\r\n\r\nwhich he is instructed how to help the public,  how\r\n\r\nto  be courteous to them and how, sometimes, to  go\r\n\r\nout of their way to help them in little matters, it\r\n\r\nwill help tremendously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerning this Head, Sir, is\r\n\r\nregarding the policemen themselves. It seems to me,\r\n\r\nSir,  that police personnel are being provided with\r\n\r\nquarters  for  which a percentage of their  pay  is\r\n\r\ndeducted. However, let us take the case, Sir, of  a\r\n\r\npoliceman  who is in Grade III. He should  live  in\r\n\r\nGrade III quarters, but if he should be given Grade\r\n\r\nIV  quarters,  he would still have to  pay  at  the\r\n\r\nGrade   III  rate.  I  would  be  obliged   if   an\r\n\r\nexplanation could be given in this matter.  I  know\r\n\r\nalso,  Sir,  that if, a Grade III officer  were  to\r\n\r\nlive in Grade II quarters, he would have to pay  at\r\n\r\nthe Grade II rate. I shall be glad, Sir, to have an\r\n\r\nexplanation for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.48 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport every word of what the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nhas just said. Despite the efficiency of our police\r\n\r\nforce,   we   must  admit  that  there   is   still\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding between the police and the  people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  The non-English-speaking  and  non-Malay  group especially do not feel that the police\r\n\r\nare  their servants or friends or protectors of law\r\n\r\nand  order.  They  merely  treat  a  policeman   as\r\n\r\nsomebody  unapproachable. We  have  witnessed  many\r\n\r\nchanges and improvements, as mentioned by the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember just now. We do not want to look on a police\r\n\r\nstation as a fearful place but as a place where  we\r\n\r\ncan  sit  down comfortably to do our business.  The\r\n\r\npeople in a police station only deal with those who\r\n\r\ncan  speak  English or Malay. But what about  those\r\n\r\nwho  cannot converse in those languages? Therefore,\r\n\r\nI   suggest  that  the  Hon. the  Chief  Secretary\r\n\r\nconsider having a Chinese-speaking officer in every\r\n\r\npolice station on a 24-hour service. I also wish to\r\n\r\npoint  out to the Hon. the Chief Secretary that  we\r\n\r\nhave,   in  Singapore,  many  Chinese  plainclothes\r\n\r\nofficers   and   detectives  and  a   few   Chinese\r\n\r\nconstables in uniforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> They will not join.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Why? The Government should go\r\n\r\nall out to try and get them to join. Maybe it is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  of  pay  or accommodation,  and  we  must\r\n\r\novercome this problem. Look at the Hongkong Police;\r\n\r\nthey  are all Chinese. I think there is very little\r\n\r\ndifference  between the Hongkong  Chinese  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Chinese as regards their traditions  and\r\n\r\nmentality.  How is it that the Hongkong  Government\r\n\r\nmanages  to  have  so  many Chinese  constables  in\r\n\r\nuniform?  We  must therefore try to encourage  more\r\n\r\nChinese to join our police force even to the extent\r\n\r\nof spending more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I am sorry that\r\n\r\nhon.  Members should feel it necessary  to  stress,\r\n\r\nafter  recent  events,  any attitude  of  hostility\r\n\r\nbetween  the  police force and police stations  and\r\n\r\nmembers of the public. At the same time, I am  glad\r\n\r\nto  hear  that the Member for Serangoon  did  think\r\n\r\nthat  there had been some improvement and  I  think\r\n\r\nthat the Member for Changi really put his finger on\r\n\r\nthe  basic  difficulty and it is  a  difficulty  of\r\n\r\nlanguage.  The  arrangements that we  have  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  are that we always try to have one Chinese-speaking  officer in every police station but  that\r\n\r\ndoes  not mean that there is always a man available\r\n\r\nwhen two or three people go in one after the other.\r\n\r\nSo  we  just  cannot  invariably  have  a  Chinese-speaking  officer available and the  answer,  I  am\r\n\r\nsure, is that we must somehow persuade more of  our\r\n\r\nChinese citizens to join the force. I do not  think\r\n\r\nthat there is anything wrong with the rates of pay.\r\n\r\nI  think it is that, for many generations,  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted that the police force  is  recruited\r\n\r\nfrom  a  certain section of the community  and  the\r\n\r\nother section has not yet developed a tradition  of\r\n\r\njoining it -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Overcome it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> - but the fault, I think, Sir, is not\r\n\r\nonly on one side.

The third  one  dealt  with\r\n\r\nretail  prices,  budget, resurveys, sampling.  The\r\n\r\nfourth  one dealt with vital statistics,  that  is,\r\n\r\nbirths,     deaths,     population,     employment,\r\n\r\nimmigration.  They  are now  asking  for  two  more\r\n\r\nstatisticians and the first one will  be  primarily\r\n\r\nrequired  to expand the gap in the national  income\r\n\r\nstatistics. Now these are very badly needed and the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Adviser  has told us that  we  must  have\r\n\r\nbetter   statistics  of  our  income, businesses,\r\n\r\nprofits, C.I.F. prices, turnovers, and so  on.  The\r\n\r\nlast  sixth one we require primarily for the census\r\n\r\nproblem to help us through the census next year and\r\n\r\nwe   want   to   keep  a  nucleus  of  the   census\r\n\r\norganisation  running through  the  years  so  that\r\n\r\nlocal  censuses  of,  shall  we  say,  agriculture,\r\n\r\nproduction  and  fisheries can be  undertaken  from\r\n\r\ntime  to  time.

Member will\r\n\r\nrecall  that  in  April this year, under  Sessional\r\n\r\nPaper No. Cmd. 18 of 1956, we obtained a supplement\r\n\r\nof  $100,000. That was to meet the cost,  first  of\r\n\r\nall,   of   the   Malayanisation  Commission   and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,   experts   who  visited   Singapore   in\r\n\r\nconnection with land titles, labour relations, cost\r\n\r\nof living statistics and certain education matters.\r\n\r\nThe  actual expenditure under this vote in 1955 was\r\n\r\n$95,000  and the expenditure up to October of  this\r\n\r\nyear  was  $121,000. What we pay from the vote  are\r\n\r\nthe fees of commissioners who are appointed locally\r\n\r\nas  in  the  case of the Malayanisation Commission,\r\n\r\nhotel charges, passages, subsistence allowances and\r\n\r\nother  expenses of the people who are invited  from\r\n\r\nother territories to come and advise us here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision in 1957 is $100,000 and takes into\r\n\r\naccount  the  probability that  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nemploy   for   the  whole  year  an  adviser   own\r\n\r\ntransport.  I  can  think of no other  commitments\r\n\r\nagainst  the  vote  other than  that  one  at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time  but I think it is prudent  to  have\r\n\r\n$100,000  in  the Estimates to meet  all  possible\r\n\r\ncontingencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second vote, item 18. \"United\r\n\r\nNations  Experts,  Local  Costs\",  this  vote   is\r\n\r\nprovided  to meet the local costs of experts  sent\r\n\r\nhere   by  the  World  Health  Organisation,   the\r\n\r\nInternational Labour Organisation,  the  Food  and\r\n\r\nAgricultural  Organisation and the United  Nations\r\n\r\nEconomic  Social  and Cultural Organisation.  When\r\n\r\nexperts from these organisations come and serve in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  their basic salaries are paid  by  the\r\n\r\norganisations  but  we are responsible  for,  what\r\n\r\nthey  call,  local  costs,  that  is,  subsistence\r\n\r\nallowance  and  travelling  allowances.  The   sum\r\n\r\nrequired or estimated by the various organisations\r\n\r\nto  be required in any particular area is given to\r\n\r\nus  and we make arrangements on request for a  sum\r\n\r\nto  be  paid  into the account of  the  particular\r\n\r\norganisation in a local bank.

The local costs  of\r\n\r\nthese people are estimated to come to about $9,500\r\n\r\nbut  we have not yet had a request from the  World\r\n\r\nHealth Organisation to pay that amount into  their\r\n\r\nbank  and consequently we are making provision  in\r\n\r\nthis  vote  next year for the amount of money  due\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again in respect of 1957, we do intend to ask\r\n\r\nfor  and receive one senior sister tutor and three\r\n\r\nnormal  sister  tutors for the Medical  Department\r\n\r\nand  it is estimated that their local charges will\r\n\r\ncome to about $9,000.

I do not have the temerity  to  make\r\n\r\nthat  remark  on my own experience, Sir,  since  I\r\n\r\nspeak  as  a  bachelor  but  I  would,  with  your\r\n\r\npermission, quote a very responsible authority.  I\r\n\r\nhave here a paragraph from the Report published in\r\n\r\n1949  by  the British Royal Commission  on  Population. Paragraph 558 reads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The giving of advice on contraception to\r\n\r\nmarried persons who want it should be accepted  as\r\n\r\na duty by the National Health Service.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All  we  seek to do is to give a little assistance\r\n\r\nto  a  voluntary charitable organisation which  in\r\n\r\nits  own  words seeks and is concerned  only  with\r\n\r\nmaking available to the poorer people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge  and facilities which  are  readily\r\n\r\navailable  to  any who cannot afford  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will permit me, I can do no better\r\n\r\nin  presenting  this matter to the House  than  to\r\n\r\ndraw  its attention to some paragraphs of a letter\r\n\r\nI received from this organisation in clarification\r\n\r\nof  its principles and the procedure it adopts  in\r\n\r\nits work. The paragraphs read:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The aim of the Association is to make available\r\n\r\nto  married  people (I repeat married people)  who\r\n\r\nrequire  knowledge  of  the principles  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning  and facilities for its practice  and  to\r\n\r\nencourage  (not the lack of manpower for Singapore\r\n\r\nbattalions)  the  production  of  healthy,   happy\r\n\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association does not seek to influence\r\n\r\npeople who do not accept these principles.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>And  that is why the Member for Bukit Panjang  has\r\n\r\nreceived   no  assistance  from  the  clinics   in\r\n\r\nquestion.   It  is  concerned  only  with   making\r\n\r\navailable  to  the poorer people of Singapore  the\r\n\r\nknowledge   and  facilities  which   are   readily\r\n\r\navailable to the rich.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advising on family planning its work is\r\n\r\ntwofold.  It  shows  couples how  to  space  their\r\n\r\nchildren so as to allow the mother to recover  her\r\n\r\nstrength fully between births, protecting her  own\r\n\r\nhealth and that of her children and how to have as\r\n\r\nmany children as they want.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is important to recognise clearly the\r\n\r\ndistinction   between  birth   control   and   contraception. Control of birth may be achieved as it\r\n\r\nhad  been  for centuries in many Eastern countries\r\n\r\nby infanticide and abortion.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo  the  answer to the hon. Member when  he  says,\r\n\r\n\"That activities of these clinics have not reduced\r\n\r\nthe  birth-rate\", is to their credit. That is  not\r\n\r\nthe  intention. But I will ask him, \"How many abortions  have their activities prevented?\" Would  he\r\n\r\nrather  than  having  family planning  to  have  a\r\n\r\nflourishing abortion trade? Abortion is even today\r\n\r\nresorted  to  by  patients who have  come  to  the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning Association clinic admitting  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  had  at least one and  some  seven  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Contraception however is the control of birth\r\n\r\nby  prevention of conception. This may be achieved\r\n\r\nby  the  scientific  method we  normally  advocate\r\n\r\nprovided   there   are   no  religious   scruples.\r\n\r\nAlternatively and less reliably, there is a method\r\n\r\nknown  as  the 'safe period' in which we  instruct\r\n\r\npatients  whose religions forbid them the  use  of\r\n\r\nthe more scientific method.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And,  Sir, this comes appropriate in view  of  the\r\n\r\nreason  given by the Member for Bukit  Panjang  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  debate of November, 1955, \"We endeavour\r\n\r\nto  respect the religion of our patients, Catholic\r\n\r\nand non-Catholic alike.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pope in his discourse to the Italian\r\n\r\nCatholic  Union of Midwives on 29th October,  1951\r\n\r\ndeclared in respect of marital relations:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Serious reasons often put forward on medical,\r\n\r\neugenic,  economic and social grounds  can  exempt\r\n\r\nfrom  that  obligatory service (marital relations)\r\n\r\neven  for a considerable period of time, even  for\r\n\r\nthe  entire  duration of the marriage. It  follows\r\n\r\nfrom this that the use of the infertile period can\r\n\r\nbe lawful from the moral point of view and, in the\r\n\r\ncircumstances  which have been  mentioned,  it  is\r\n\r\nindeed lawful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That,  Sir,  comes from the head of  the  Catholic\r\n\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of family planning is to assist\r\n\r\nthose who are infertile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said before and, unfortunately, there are\r\n\r\nno  new arguments - there can be none - in respect  of\r\n\r\nbasic  human  problems. This is a service  to  the\r\n\r\nmass  of  the  people who cannot  afford  to  seek\r\n\r\nassistance from expensive doctors. The Association\r\n\r\ndoes not go out of its way to force its advice  on\r\n\r\nanybody nor does it advise single persons. It only\r\n\r\nadvises  married couples who come  for  assistance\r\n\r\nand some of them are advised according to Catholic\r\n\r\nprecepts in respect of the infertile period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

The\r\n\r\nMember for Queenstown should have the patience  to\r\n\r\nhear  what  another  Member may  have  to  say  in\r\n\r\nsupport of the amendment.

We  argued yesterday  about  income  tax\r\n\r\nbeing  based  on a pan-Malayan structure.  We  have\r\n\r\nmany  existing Government departments  on  a  pan-Malayan  basis  too. All Parties,  including  even\r\n\r\nthose  in  the Federation of Malaya, have promised\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore and the Federation will merge very\r\n\r\nsoon.  Therefore why should we argue all the  time\r\n\r\non   the  basis  of  this  small  island  with   a\r\n\r\npopulation  of  just over one million  people?  We\r\n\r\nshould have the confidence to hope that very soon,\r\n\r\ndespite all the duties and tariffs imposed  on  us\r\n\r\nby  the Federation Government, our brothers across\r\n\r\nthe  Straits of Johore will force us to merge with\r\n\r\nthem.  Therefore we must always think on the basis\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  will  very soon  merge  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya and we will then be a  bigger\r\n\r\nfamily.

We  want\r\n\r\npolitical independence but, at the same  time,  we\r\n\r\nmust have ideological independence. We cannot  say\r\n\r\nthat if Mao Tse-tung supports family planning,  we\r\n\r\nmust therefore support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Is he supporting it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> He is supporting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would say that if the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning Association is really organised  and  run\r\n\r\nby  an  ordinary citizen or a wage-earner, and  if\r\n\r\nour  local medical services have not extended  any\r\n\r\nassistance at all towards those people who  intend\r\n\r\nto give advice on birth control, I will give up my\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are two questions facing us. Firstly,\r\n\r\nI understand from the Minister for Health that all\r\n\r\nhis  hospitals  and clinics are prepared  to  give\r\n\r\nevery  assistance and advice to whoever approaches\r\n\r\na  Government medical officer or a nurse for  such\r\n\r\nassistance  and advice. Secondly, all officers  of\r\n\r\nthe  Family  Planning Association - I  am  sure  the\r\n\r\nletter  from  which the Member for  Cairnhill  was\r\n\r\nreading    looks   like   it   came   from    this\r\n\r\nAssociation - are rich, distinguished and noble, and\r\n\r\nbelong  to  the  first class  of  people  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry. If they are really public-spirit  minded,\r\n\r\nthey  should not ask their husbands to buy diamond\r\n\r\nrings  and beautiful bracelets for them.  If  each\r\n\r\none  could  contribute one diamond  ring  and  one\r\n\r\nbeautiful   bracelet  to  the   Association, the\r\n\r\n$100,000 would be there. Therefore, to prove  that\r\n\r\nthe  officers  of the Family Planning  Association\r\n\r\nare  really  public-spirited, they  should  be  on\r\n\r\ntheir own, as is the case in the United States and\r\n\r\nEngland,  and  raise donations from those  persons\r\n\r\nwho  support family planning: but they should  not\r\n\r\ncome to this Assembly every year to ask for\r\n\r\nmoney,  as  the  Member for  Queenstown  said.  We\r\n\r\nshould   not  waste  time  on  this  controversial\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely appeal to the officers of the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association to run  the  Association  on\r\n\r\ntheir own efforts and not to disturb this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Members of this House\r\n\r\nwill  agree that this is a very important  matter;\r\n\r\nso  important, that the Government last year  left\r\n\r\nit  to  an open vote in order to allow each person\r\n\r\nto  speak  and  vote according to his  conscience.\r\n\r\nThis  Government has again this year for that very\r\n\r\nreason, because it is highly controversial,  allowed  the  matter to go before the Assembly so  that\r\n\r\neach  person  could vote again  according  to  his\r\n\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Do we have changing consciences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The last speaker has the most changing\r\n\r\nconscience that I have ever known of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Sir, the question of whether\r\n\r\nGovernment should contribute\r\n\r\npublic money towards the advancement of the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association  is,  as  has  already  been\r\n\r\npointed out, a highly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontroversial one and for that very reason, I have\r\n\r\nsaid,  this Government has allowed it  to  be  put\r\n\r\nagain  to  an  open vote so that each  Member  can\r\n\r\nspeak  and vote according to his beliefs  and  his\r\n\r\nconscience. That policy is adopted this  year  for\r\n\r\nthe  very  same  reason and I hope  that  whatever\r\n\r\nGovernment is in power, it will always allow  this\r\n\r\ncontroversial matter which affects the deep-rooted\r\n\r\nconvictions of certain communities to be put to an\r\n\r\nopen  vote. Members of this Assembly may come  and\r\n\r\ngo  but  whoever  are  elected  and  sit  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  must speak for the communities  who  put\r\n\r\nthem into power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, at this stage, to reply to a few\r\n\r\nremarks made by the Member for Cairnhill. He spoke\r\n\r\nagainst the views which were put by the Member for\r\n\r\nBukit  Panjang last year. That hon.  Member  spoke\r\n\r\nfrom  his heart as a Roman Catholic and he  should\r\n\r\nnever  have  been condemned for that  reason.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Cairnhill said that it was the duty  of\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  perform what this House  is  being\r\n\r\nasked  to  conribute to. I say that if  any  woman\r\n\r\nwho, for health reasons, wishes to consult any  of\r\n\r\nour  doctors in our hospitals, she can always  get\r\n\r\nfree  advice.  He also said - as I  understand  it,\r\n\r\nsubject to correction\r\n\r\n- that  all  the  workers in  the  Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation  are  voluntary  workers.  Subject  to\r\n\r\ncorrection,  I  am informed otherwise.  There  are\r\n\r\nsome  who  are  paid workers there and  paid  with\r\n\r\nmonies which this House is asked to contribute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the same hon. Member read a portion of a\r\n\r\nletter he received, saying that these people  give\r\n\r\nassistance  to  the poor people.  Our  domiciliary\r\n\r\nnurses and nurses also give assistance to the poor\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nand everyone in this House that this is not a vote\r\n\r\nfor   or  against  family  planning.  I  have  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  respect for the voluntary  workers who\r\n\r\ndevote  their time to what they think is a sincere\r\n\r\nservice  and  one  which in their  opinion  is  of\r\n\r\npublic good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main question before this House is: should the $100,000 contributed by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  members  of  the  public  be  used  for  that\r\n\r\npurpose?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also read a very short\r\n\r\nportion  of  the discourse which His Holiness  the\r\n\r\nPope  gave  to  midwives in respect of  the  \"safe\r\n\r\nperiod\". It is only in very extreme cases, he  has\r\n\r\ntold  midwives, that use or knowledge of the \"safe\r\n\r\nperiod\"  can be put to practice. Why did  not  the\r\n\r\nhon.   Member  read  further?  I  have  the  whole\r\n\r\ndiscourse of His Holiness the Pope -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Why do you not read it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> - and he will see from that that the\r\n\r\nwhole   discourse   was   against   the   use   of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My attitude in this question is well known and\r\n\r\nthat attitude will never change. I say now and  I\r\n\r\nwill  keep  on repeating that public funds  which\r\n\r\nare contributed by people of all races and creeds\r\n\r\nin this colony should not be used for any purpose\r\n\r\nwhich  is contrary to the very tenets of  certain\r\n\r\nreligious  bodies and beliefs of  any  particular\r\n\r\ncommunity. Governments past and present  have  always  respected the religious tenets and  beliefs\r\n\r\nof  the  various religions in our community.  For\r\n\r\nexample, Government has never enforced cremations\r\n\r\nalthough it is highly desirable to conserve  land\r\n\r\nin   this  country.  Land  is  very  useful   for\r\n\r\ndevelopment but large plots of land are  allotted\r\n\r\nfor  burial  grounds  for those  whose  religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs are against cremation. Imagine the uproar\r\n\r\nif  cremations were forced upon the Muslims -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Who is forcing family planning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> You are forcing us to pay the money\r\n\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr G.

Member\r\n\r\nwishes  to  make a point, he will have  the  opportunity to do so later on. Let us not have so  many\r\n\r\ninterventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Thank you, Sir. I am\r\n\r\nsurprised  at  the levity with which certain  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers take on this very serious subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government has also built abbatoirs for people professing the Muslim faith\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho   can   have  their  animals  slaughtered   in\r\n\r\naccordance with Muslim rites. Also for  that  very\r\n\r\nreason, this House has sent the Muslims Bill to  a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  with the  directive  that  they\r\n\r\nconsider the introduction into the Bill of  clause\r\n\r\n47  which  provides that every Muslim when  making\r\n\r\nhis  will  must  distribute  his property   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with Muslim law and not in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the laws of the land. Now, why have we  done\r\n\r\nthis?  It  is  because each Member of  this  House\r\n\r\nrightly   respects  the  wishes  of  the  minority\r\n\r\nparticularly when their wishes strike at the  very\r\n\r\nfundamental beliefs and tenets of their  religion.\r\n\r\nI  would  ask the Muslim Members of this House  to\r\n\r\nplease  remember that. But again,  I  repeat  that\r\n\r\nthis  is  not a religious issue. I made  it  clear\r\n\r\nlast  year  and I repeat this year that  the  only\r\n\r\nissue  before this House is not whether the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association be permitted  to  exist  but\r\n\r\nwhether  public funds should be used to  subsidise\r\n\r\nthis  association. I have no doubt, as I have said\r\n\r\njust  now,  that decent public-spirited people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are voluntarily helping the association.\r\n\r\nI do not say to them \"discontinue your work\". This\r\n\r\nassociation,  whatever  good  it  claims  to   do,\r\n\r\nshould,  in  my  opinion, be run  by  a  voluntary\r\n\r\norganisation  as  it  is in  the  United  Kingdom,\r\n\r\nUnited  States, in all civilised countries  except\r\n\r\nin  Japan and India (I have a few comments to make\r\n\r\nabout  India in a moment) and in a very few  other\r\n\r\ncountries where token votes are made. Now,  it  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to  note  that even  in  India  where\r\n\r\nfamily planning is supposed to be sponsored by the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  it is very doubtful whether  this  is\r\n\r\naccepted  by  all provincial governments.  It  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reported in the Indian Press that early last\r\n\r\nmonth  the  Bombay Legislature was informed  by  a\r\n\r\nMinister there that his government did not  accept\r\n\r\nfamily planning, and they were against the use  of\r\n\r\ncontraceptives and that the Minister had  informed\r\n\r\nthe  central Government in New Delhi that  he  did\r\n\r\nnot  want to accept the monetary grant offered  by\r\n\r\nthe   central  Government  to  Bombay  for  family\r\n\r\nplanning work in the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have ascertained the views of several members\r\n\r\nof   various   communities,  (apart   from   Roman\r\n\r\nCatholics)  to  whom I have spoken,  and  a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of them are against the principle of  their\r\n\r\nmoney  being used for this purpose. They are  from\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim  community  although  there  are  some\r\n\r\nMuslims  who have accepted the ruling that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  against their religion, but there is a  large\r\n\r\nnumber of them who are very much against\r\n\r\nit.  The Buddhists and the Jews - yes, I repeat even\r\n\r\nthe  Jews  whom  I  have spoken to - and  Christians\r\n\r\nstrongly object to their money being used for this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

[Interruption].\r\n\r\nLevity again, Mr Chairman, Sir, from those  I  am\r\n\r\nsurprised to see!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, there is a great\r\n\r\nmaldistribution of wealth in society  and,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  those  who wish to cloak  the  evils  of\r\n\r\ncolonialism  and capitalism will  support  this grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Chairman, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to read just one portion of what I have said\r\n\r\nlast  year  which bears repetition.  I  said  that\r\n\r\nalongside with wealth, there was quite a  lot  of\r\n\r\nsqualor in this country. I went on to say:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"In these areas people suffer squalor and\r\n\r\npoverty  but, please note, not because as, normal\r\n\r\nhuman  beings they desire children, and once  they\r\n\r\nhave   them  they  can  only  support  them   with\r\n\r\ndifficulty. The reason is\r\n\r\nbecause, before our time, no attempt was\r\n\r\nmade  to see that the people were properly  housed\r\n\r\nand   paid  proper  wages,  and  because  colonial\r\n\r\neconomy     did    not    allow     for     normal\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. This is the problem  now.  This\r\n\r\nis  our  heritage from the period fortunately  now\r\n\r\nover,  when  nominated  and  official  individuals\r\n\r\nplayed  at  politics  and thought  that  so-called\r\n\r\nfamily  planning could be disguised as  a  radical\r\n\r\nsocial reform.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  would  be, in my opinion, a disgrace  to  this\r\n\r\ncountry to spend this colossal sum of $100,000  of\r\n\r\npublic  money on such a project when  the  country\r\n\r\ncan ill-afford wastage of funds and when the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment  finds  it imperative  to  impose  high\r\n\r\ntaxes  to meet deficits.
