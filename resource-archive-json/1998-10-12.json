Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent closure of\r\n\r\ntrading  of  Malaysian  shares on Clob, after  Malaysia  imposed\r\n\r\ncapital controls and new rules on the clearing and settlement of\r\n\r\nMalaysian  shares,  has highlighted the risks  of  investing  in\r\n\r\nshares.  There  is a price risk inherent in any  share.  But  in\r\n\r\naddition,  shares listed on overseas exchanges  are  subject  to\r\n\r\nregulatory  risk arising from changes in rules by  the  overseas\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government cannot protect investors from such risks.\r\n\r\nInvestors  have to keep their eyes open and judge for themselves\r\n\r\nwhether the returns are adequate to justify the risks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian government's opposition to trading of\r\n\r\nMalaysian  shares on Clob is long standing, and has always  been\r\n\r\nreported in the press. When the SES established Clob in  January\r\n\r\n1990,  after Malaysia unilaterally delisted all Malaysian shares\r\n\r\nfrom  the  SES, the KLSE objected strongly. It declared publicly\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nClob  was  an unrecognised market, and warned investors  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers in trading Malaysian shares on Clob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as August 1998, the National Economic Action\r\n\r\nCouncil  of  Malaysia called for the closure of  Clob.  The  SES\r\n\r\nresponded that Clob would remain viable only so long as there is\r\n\r\ndemand from investors for its services. This exchange was widely\r\n\r\nreported in the press, and put investors on notice of Malaysia's\r\n\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES has issued a statement explaining why it did not\r\n\r\nstop  trading of Malaysian shares on Clob earlier, for  example,\r\n\r\nimmediately  after  the KLSE announced its  new  rules  on  31st\r\n\r\nAugust  1998,  or  even  before  that.  It  apologised  for  not\r\n\r\nreassuring  investors earlier than 7th September 1998  that  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian actions had not made their shares worthless.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  omission did not make a material difference  to  Malaysian\r\n\r\nshare prices on Clob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the SES had given repeated assurances to\r\n\r\ninvestors that their shares were not worthless, shares  on  Clob\r\n\r\ncontinued  to trade at a deep discount1 to prices on  the  KLSE.\r\n\r\nOnce the Malaysian measures were announced, nothing the SES  did\r\n\r\ncould  prevent a decline of share prices on Clob. Many investors\r\n\r\nevidently preferred to sell their shares on Clob and receive the\r\n\r\nproceeds  in Singapore dollars, rather than wait to  dispose  of\r\n\r\ntheir  shares  on  KLSE  and retain their  proceeds  in  Ringgit\r\n\r\naccounts  in  Malaysia for one year, as required under  the  new\r\n\r\nMalaysian rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n1  On 28th August 1998, Clob shares were traded at a discount of\r\n\r\nonly 9% on average, compared to the prices of the shares on  the\r\n\r\nKLSE.  Following the amendment of the Malaysian measures on 31st\r\n\r\nAugust  1998 and 1st September 1998, the discount on Club prices\r\n\r\nwidened  to  49% on 3rd September 1998. Club was suspended  from\r\n\r\ntrading on 4th September 1998, and subsequently reopened  for  5\r\n\r\ntrading days from 9th to 15th September 1998.  At the end of the\r\n\r\ntrading period, the discount on Clob shares averaged 42%.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st August 1998, 197,000 investors held Malaysian\r\n\r\nshares  on  Clob.  90%  were Singaporean investors.   Many  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors  sold their shares after the Malaysian  measures  were\r\n\r\nannounced,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincluding 24,000 who sold all their Malaysian shares. They would\r\n\r\nhave  made  losses.   But for every seller there  was  a  buyer,\r\n\r\nhoping  to  make  a  gain by buying the shares and  subsequently\r\n\r\nselling them on the KLSE. Most such investors, be they buyers or\r\n\r\nsellers, were Singaporean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure of trading of Malaysian shares on Clob is a\r\n\r\nloss  to  Singapore's  financial sector, but  the  loss  is  not\r\n\r\nsignificant  relative to the size of the financial  sector.   In\r\n\r\n1997,  the  stock  market accounted for  10%  of  the  financial\r\n\r\nsector's  value added, or 1.1% of overall GDP2. Clob represented\r\n\r\nabout  24% of the SES' turnover at that stage. But more recently\r\n\r\nfrom June 1998 to August 1998, Clob's share had declined to only\r\n\r\n3-8%  of the total turnover in the stock market. Moreover, since\r\n\r\nthe  closure  of Clob trading of Malaysian shares,  some  retail\r\n\r\ninvestors have channelled their interest into Singapore shares3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n2   In  1997,  the  share of the stock market in  the  financial\r\n\r\nservices  sector was 9.9%, and the financial services sector  in\r\n\r\nturn had a share of 11.4% in overall GDP.\r\n\r\n3   For  the  period from 1st September 1998 to  15th  September\r\n\r\n1998,  the  average  daily  turnover  of  Singapore  shares  was\r\n\r\n$190.3m.  This has increased to $201.1m during the  period  from\r\n\r\n16th September 1998 to 30th September 1998.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver  the  years, the SES has taken steps to develop the  market\r\n\r\nfor  local  and foreign shares. Clob is not a market solely  for\r\n\r\ntrading Malaysian shares, although because of historical reasons\r\n\r\nand  investors' familiarity, the bulk of the trade on  Clob  has\r\n\r\nbeen   in   Malaysian  shares.   The  SES  will   continue   its\r\n\r\ndevelopmental efforts to provide investors with a broad range of\r\n\r\noptions for trading of Asian shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's financial sector provides a wide range of\r\n\r\nservices  and  products, and serves a large pool  of  investors,\r\n\r\nborrowers and financial intermediaries. The regional crisis  has\r\n\r\nshrunk  the  volume of financial activity, but  the  sector  has\r\n\r\nremained resilient. Some financial activities have continued  to\r\n\r\ngrow  despite  the  slowdown.  A recent Bank  for  International\r\n\r\nSettlements  survey found that daily turnover in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nforeign\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexchange  market  has  increased  by  32%  since  1995,  whereas\r\n\r\nturnover  in  the other major Asian financial centres  declined.\r\n\r\nSIMEX  is  also  experiencing a record year in  trading  futures\r\n\r\ncontracts.  Investors increasingly appreciate  our  AAA  country\r\n\r\nrisk  rating, and the transparent, predictable and open business\r\n\r\nenvironment  that  Singapore offers. We are therefore  confident\r\n\r\nthat despite difficulties and occasional setbacks, Singapore  is\r\n\r\nstrengthening its position as a financial hub in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on 3rd\r\n\r\nSeptember 1998, SES announced that Clob would continue  as  long\r\n\r\nas  there is demand.  On 4th September 1998, it suddenly decided\r\n\r\nto  suspend trading and close Clob.  Would the Minister  explain\r\n\r\nwhat  situational changes between 3rd and 4th September resulted\r\n\r\nin SES making an about-turn?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second supplementary question is: why did SES wait\r\n\r\nuntil  7th September 1998, about a week after Malaysia announced\r\n\r\nthe  new  measures,  to assure the investors that  their  shares\r\n\r\nwould  not be worthless?  Was SES itself not sure, prior to  7th\r\n\r\nSeptember, about the status of the shares traded in Clob?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third supplementary question is: was the Government\r\n\r\naware,  during  the setting up of Clob, that Clob  itself  could\r\n\r\nface  eventual closure under some circumstances if Malaysia were\r\n\r\nto take extreme measures?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the Malaysians first made the\r\n\r\nannouncement, as SES explained in the press statement, SES could\r\n\r\nnot  straightaway close the market.  There was no reason for  it\r\n\r\nto   do  so.   As  Members  will  remember,  subsequently,   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians also imposed currency controls and, as a result, that\r\n\r\nremoved the arbitraging between the Singapore Clob and the KLSE.\r\n\r\nWhen  that  happened,  it became obvious  that  Clob  could  not\r\n\r\ncontinue any more and that is why SES suspended trading to  make\r\n\r\nthe  announcement that trading would continue for  another  five\r\n\r\ndays, after which the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnominee accounts would be migrated to the KLSE.  I think SES has\r\n\r\nresponded correctly at every stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue is when to suspend trading on stock\r\n\r\nexchanges.  This is something that you cannot take lightly and I\r\n\r\nthink  SES  made the right decision in providing an orderly  and\r\n\r\nfree market so that investors can trade in the securities.   But\r\n\r\nwhen  conditions became clear that it no longer could trade  any\r\n\r\nmore because the arbitraging between the two exchanges could not\r\n\r\ntake place, SES had to suspend trading and close down Clob. This\r\n\r\nexplains the about-turn.  It is not just the closure of Clob but\r\n\r\nalso the imposition of currency controls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also asked why it took one week. This is because of\r\n\r\nthe announcement subsequently by the Malaysian government on the\r\n\r\ncurrency controls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third question was, if we knew that Clob could be\r\n\r\nclosed,  why  did we not take measures to prevent it.   SES  has\r\n\r\nexplained that Clob exists only to service investors.   As  long\r\n\r\nas  there  is a demand for its services, there is a  reason  for\r\n\r\nClob  to  exist.  Clob also services the Malaysian investors  by\r\n\r\nproviding  liquidity  and  more volume.   So  it  is  a  win-win\r\n\r\nsituation  for  both  sides  in  having  Clob.   But  once   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians decided on currency controls, then they are  prepared\r\n\r\nto  accept the disadvantages of not having Clob, in having lower\r\n\r\nliquidity,  etc.   They  are  prepared  to  take  that  loss  in\r\n\r\nfurtherance of their overall currency controls and,  under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances, Clob cannot exist any more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I do not think the Minister has\r\n\r\nanswered  my question.  My question is: why was there an  about-turn between 3rd and 4th September 1998?  On 3rd September,  SES\r\n\r\nannounced  that Clob would continue as long as there is  demand.\r\n\r\nThe  currency controls imposed by Malaysia was announced on  1st\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998.  After this announcement of currency  controls,\r\n\r\nSES  announced that Clob would continue trading.   Then  on  4th\r\n\r\nSeptember, it was suddenly decided to close down Clob.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: why did Clob not assure investors\r\n\r\nearlier  that  their  shares would not be worthless?   Why  wait\r\n\r\nuntil  7th September?  Was SES itself not sure about the  status\r\n\r\nof the shares?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> With hindsight, it is always possible to\r\n\r\nraise  these questions.  These events took place rather rapidly,\r\n\r\nand  as  the  market  adjusted it was not possible  for  SES  to\r\n\r\nintervene  and  make  an announcement and unsettle  the  market.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  announcement was made about the rules for  Clob,  SES\r\n\r\nresponded by saying that it would remain open and it would trade\r\n\r\nas long as there is demand for its services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the currency controls were imposed and the differences\r\n\r\nstarted to widen between the two markets, it became obvious,  as\r\n\r\nthe  days  went  on,  that they could not  arbitrage  any  more.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the very vital feedback link was no longer there  and\r\n\r\nyou were just trading within yourselves without taking advantage\r\n\r\nof the price changes in the KLSE.  That is why on 4th September,\r\n\r\nSES decided that it was no longer possible to continue with Clob\r\n\r\nand had to suspend trading and close down Clob.  You do not make\r\n\r\nthat  kind of decision immediately.  You have to weigh the  pros\r\n\r\nand  cons  and  you  have  to assess the  impact.   You  do  not\r\n\r\nimmediately  close  Clob.  What happens if that  was  the  wrong\r\n\r\ndecision?  Then investors would be disadvantaged.  I think it is\r\n\r\nfair  for  SES to make its decision after consultation with  all\r\n\r\nthe  players  and  after assessing the impact  of  the  currency\r\n\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His next question was why SES did not tell the investors\r\n\r\nthat  their  shares  were not worthless.  I think  SES  did  not\r\n\r\nrealise  that  Singaporeans  thought  that  their  shares   were\r\n\r\nworthless.  These were controls imposed by KLSE.  If you are  an\r\n\r\ninformed  investor,  you know there is an  omnibus  account,  of\r\n\r\nwhich  your  own  stocks  can  be  migrated  to  the  KLSE  MCD.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  there is no reason for Singaporeans  to  think  that\r\n\r\ntheir stocks were worthless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two things happening in the market during that\r\n\r\nperiod.  First, there was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  lot  of uncertainty.  The KLSE was changing rules practically\r\n\r\nevery  other  day.   So  there was  a  lot  of  uncertainty  and\r\n\r\nconfusion.  Second, there was a great premium to get out of  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  As Members could see, the difference between the  share\r\n\r\nprices  in Clob and the KLSE prices widened to 49% and  even  at\r\n\r\nthe end of the trading, it ended at 42%, which shows there was a\r\n\r\nhigh  premium.   Singaporean investors have  decided  that  they\r\n\r\nwanted  to get out of it and they wanted to take their  proceeds\r\n\r\nin Singapore dollars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such circumstances of uncertainty as well as a high\r\n\r\npremium  on  getting  out and having the proceeds  in  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollars,  it  was  not obvious to SES that people  were  trading\r\n\r\nbelow  the  value of KLSE just because they thought  that  their\r\n\r\nshares  were worthless.  The interpretation is that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwanted  to  get  out  their proceeds in  Singapore  dollars  and\r\n\r\ntherefore were prepared to accept the heavy discount.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> It seems to me, from the Minister's\r\n\r\nanswer,  that  SES was not able to fully appreciate  the  market\r\n\r\nsituation  as  well as the rules that would affect the  trading.\r\n\r\nWould it not be more prudent for SES then to suspend trading  on\r\n\r\nClob  on 1st September after knowing the effect and at the  same\r\n\r\ntime assessing the impact on Clob rather than to suspend trading\r\n\r\nlater?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I have said earlier, a decision to\r\n\r\nsuspend  trading is something that you do not take lightly.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  SES  has suspended trading on the market for  only  three\r\n\r\ndays in 1985, and that is to SES' credit that we keep the market\r\n\r\nopen.   That is the role of the Exchange, ie, to keep the market\r\n\r\nopen.   As long as there is equal information available to buyer\r\n\r\nand  seller, the role of the Exchange is to keep it  open.   The\r\n\r\nExchange  only suspends trading if it is assessed that there  is\r\n\r\ninequity in the availability of the market information.  In this\r\n\r\ncase,  buyers  and  sellers were operating  on  the  same  level\r\n\r\nplaying field.  The announcement was made by the Malaysians.  It\r\n\r\nis  up  to you to decide whether to buy or sell and whether  you\r\n\r\nare going to make money or lose\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmoney.  For every seller, as long as there is a buyer, there  is\r\n\r\na  basis  for the market.  But if SES feels that the information\r\n\r\nis only available to one group and not to the other group, then,\r\n\r\nof course, to be the referee, it ought to suspend trading on the\r\n\r\nmarket.  So such conditions were not there on 1st September  and\r\n\r\nthere was no reason for SES to suspend trading on the market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, will the Minister\r\n\r\nremind  the House that when trading on the stock market in  1985\r\n\r\nwas suspended by the Stock Exchange, Singapore was subjected  to\r\n\r\na  great deal of criticism for doing so?  So I think there is  a\r\n\r\nvery high price to be paid for the suspension of trading on  the\r\n\r\nstock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the SES suspended trading on the\r\n\r\nmarket in 1985, because of the Pan-El crisis, that decision  was\r\n\r\nalso criticised by many investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MALAYSIA'S CURRENCY CONTROL MEASURES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry what is the extent of the impact of Malaysia's currency\r\n\r\ncontrol measures on our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and\r\n\r\nIndustry  whether Malaysia's imposition of capital and  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrols will have any adverse effect on economic cooperation in\r\n\r\nASEAN.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, may I have permission to answer Question  Nos.  5\r\n\r\nand 6 together, as they are related?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Given the close interdependence of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Malaysian  economies,  it  is  inevitable   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be affected by Malaysia's capital  and  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrol   measures.   The  closure  of  CLOB  is  an   immediate\r\n\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity in Singapore's foreign exchange market has been\r\n\r\nreduced by the cessation of Ringgit trades.  However, trading in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nRinggit had already declined over the past months and was only a\r\n\r\nsmall  proportion of total turnover just prior to  the  exchange\r\n\r\ncontrols.   There  will also be some loss of  business  for  our\r\n\r\nbanks  and  fund  managers as they can no longer accept  Ringgit\r\n\r\ndeposits  or trade in the currency.  Offshore loans to  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthrough Singapore's Asian Dollar Market, albeit a small share of\r\n\r\ntotal offshore loans, could also be affected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures are also likely to affect bilateral trade.\r\n\r\nCompanies  with  substantial  Ringgit  contracts  have  to   re-negotiate  their  contracts and financing  arrangements.   There\r\n\r\nwill  be additional administrative costs as all settlements must\r\n\r\nnow  be  in  foreign  currency.  A  double  conversion  cost  is\r\n\r\nincurred  as traders have to convert their export earnings  into\r\n\r\nRinggit and convert their Ringgit to foreign currencies  to  pay\r\n\r\nfor  imports.   The ease of getting Bank Negara's  authorisation\r\n\r\nfor   obtaining  foreign  exchange  for  trade  and  for  profit\r\n\r\nrepatriation purposes will be critical.  Any bureaucratic  delay\r\n\r\nwill mean higher business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 60% of our trade with Malaysia are intra-firm, intra-MNC trade. These are mainly denominated in US Dollars. These\r\n\r\noperations  are  unlikely  to be affected  much  by  the  recent\r\n\r\nmeasures.   Only about 6% of bilateral trade are denominated  in\r\n\r\nRinggit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures will also mean a drop in Malaysian investments\r\n\r\ninto  Singapore  as  there will be limits imposed  on  Malaysian\r\n\r\ninvestments abroad.  However, such investments account for  only\r\n\r\na  very  small  percentage  of  total  investment  inflows  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is the potential downgrading of investor\r\n\r\ninterest in the region.  The outlook for foreign investment  has\r\n\r\nalready  weakened  because of the regional crisis.   Uncertainty\r\n\r\narising  from Malaysia's capital controls may further discourage\r\n\r\nforeign investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's capital controls represent a step backwards in\r\n\r\nASEAN's   efforts  to  liberalise  its  trade   and   investment\r\n\r\nenvironment.   ASEAN  will have to work  harder  to  bring  back\r\n\r\ninvestor confidence into the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregion.

Of course, they are closely watching the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nsituation.   And  even  Malaysia  is  keen  to  attract  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments.   So  we were discussing the possibility  of  maybe\r\n\r\nbringing forward the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area\r\n\r\nas  a  strong signal to the market that we are on track and,  if\r\n\r\nanything,  we  want  to push forward even more  vigorously  with\r\n\r\ntrade liberalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Is there any sense that there is a\r\n\r\nthinking among the ASEAN countries to impose capital controls as\r\n\r\nwell?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Apart from Malaysia, my assessment is\r\n\r\nthat countries like Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines  and\r\n\r\nothers, are not taking up capital\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncontrols.

We\r\n\r\nwill:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Allow the PARF certificate to be used to offset the various\r\n\r\none-time  upfront vehicle taxes and fees, namely, the  ARF,  the\r\n\r\nCOE and Registration Fees (RF), at the point of registration  of\r\n\r\na new car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Allow the use of more than one PARF certificate per car,\r\n\r\nand  conversely allow the PARF benefits to offset the  ARF,  COE\r\n\r\nand RF of more than one new car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Extend the validity period of PARF certificate from the\r\n\r\ncurrent 6 months to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the validity period of all unused existing\r\n\r\nPARF  certificates  will be with immediate  effect.   The  other\r\n\r\nmeasures  will be implemented from 1st November 1998  after  the\r\n\r\ncomputerised vehicle registry system is amended.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA will announce details of these measures shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he  thinks it is fair for the Government to budget  for\r\n\r\nrevenue  from COEs and the import tax of cars but  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime  it cannot budget an amount to pay back the scrap value  of\r\n\r\ncars in cash.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I think the Member does not understand the\r\n\r\nconcept  of  PARF.

It is not a deposit  that\r\n\r\npeople  have to put with the Government and before 10 years,  if\r\n\r\nthey  scrap  their car, they are going to get this amount  back.\r\n\r\nThat is the first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that in terms of prudent financial\r\n\r\nbudgeting, we must provide for a contingent liability because in\r\n\r\nthe case of people wanting their money back, we must be prepared\r\n\r\nto  give  it  to them, if we decide to give back in  cash.   You\r\n\r\ncould  argue that in the case where there is the same number  of\r\n\r\npeople  registering  new  cars and the  same  number  of  people\r\n\r\nscrapping their cars, that the money from PARF can be offset  by\r\n\r\nARF.   That  may  well be so now.  What happens  if  we  have  a\r\n\r\nsituation,  one  could  argue that it is an  extreme  situation,\r\n\r\nwhere  everybody  wants to scrap his car  but  nobody  wants  to\r\n\r\nregister new cars?  You can say that is extreme. What happens if\r\n\r\nit  is  close to that situation? Do you know how much money  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would have to set aside?  Billions of dollars.   Why\r\n\r\ndon't  we want to do that?  Because every cent that is put  into\r\n\r\ncontingent  liability is money that cannot  be  used  for  other\r\n\r\nworthwhile purposes.  So we recognise the problem but  we  think\r\n\r\nthis  is a better and more practical and safer way to solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem.

It is  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nroads  free-flowing,  in order to reduce  the  overall  cost  of\r\n\r\ntransporting  goods and people.  It does so by  using  price  to\r\n\r\nspread  traffic  on  our roads evenly throughout  the  day.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of ERP is not to generate more revenue. That is why,  as\r\n\r\npart  of  the  implementation of the ERP, we  have  reduced  the\r\n\r\nupfront and annual costs of vehicle ownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Reducing upfront taxes/ERP rebates/Phasing-in ERP charges</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer Mr Chay, under the new vehicle tax structure that\r\n\r\nhas  been  implemented since 1st April this year, upfront  taxes\r\n\r\nsuch  as Registration Fees (RF) and Additional Registration Fees\r\n\r\n(ARF) had been reduced drastically for the majority of vehicles.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the RF for heavy goods vehicles was reduced  from\r\n\r\n$14,000  to $140 (99%). The ARF for tourist coaches was  reduced\r\n\r\nfrom  55%  of  OMV to 5% of OMV, resulting in savings  of  about\r\n\r\n$28,000  per vehicle.  In addition, most vehicle owners  enjoyed\r\n\r\nsavings  from reduction in their annual road tax or diesel  tax,\r\n\r\nranging from an average of $280 per year for car owners to a few\r\n\r\nthousand dollars for goods vehicles and buses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also giving ERP rebates to motorists over the next\r\n\r\nfew  years, starting with $200 per PCU for the first year of ERP\r\n\r\nimplementation  starting 1st September  this  year.   For  those\r\n\r\nmotorists  who do not need to or decide not to pass through  ERP\r\n\r\ngantries,  and these motorists are in the majority, this  rebate\r\n\r\nis a bonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses adjust to the ERP system, we have phased-in the rates for taxis and commercial vehicles over the next\r\n\r\nfour   years.   Taxis  are  currently  levied  one-third   while\r\n\r\ncommercial vehicles pay only one-quarter of their respective ERP\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire package of road tax reduction and ERP rebates,\r\n\r\nnot  taking  into account revenue from ERP, will save  motorists\r\n\r\nand businesses about $1.5 billion over the next five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cost/revenue of ERP System</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked about the cost of ERP. The development and\r\n\r\nimplementation of the ERP system cost about $213 million.   This\r\n\r\nincludes  the  cost of fitting the In-vehicle Units  (IUs)  onto\r\n\r\n653,000 vehicles during a 10-month long IU fitting exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost of operating the ERP system is about $9\r\n\r\nmillion.   The   manual  Area Licensing Scheme  (ALS)  and  Road\r\n\r\nPricing  Scheme  (RPS)  cost $17 million  per  year,  mainly  in\r\n\r\nmanpower cost. While the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprimary objective of ERP is not cost reduction per se,\r\n\r\nnevertheless, it is less labour intensive, and therefore more\r\n\r\ncost-effective in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of revenue, the Government is collecting less from\r\n\r\nthe  ERP  than from the old system.  In September 1998,  revenue\r\n\r\ncollection  from ERP was about $6.6 million, which is  23%  less\r\n\r\nthan  the average monthly revenue of $8.6 million under the  old\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>ERP implementation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the first phase ERP since 1st\r\n\r\nSeptember  1998 has led to a significant improvement in  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions   within  the  CBD.   Traffic  volume  entering   the\r\n\r\nRestricted  Zone  has been reduced by about 24%,  while  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions on the ECP and PIE have also remained good.  However,\r\n\r\non  the  CTE,  traffic  congestion has  worsened,  with  average\r\n\r\ntraffic  speed falling to 35-50 kph, which is below the  optimal\r\n\r\nlevel  of  50-55 kph.  This is primarily due to the  substantial\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of taxis and commercial vehicles  using\r\n\r\nthe CTE .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fully realise the benefits of the ERP system, we must\r\n\r\nensure  that  rates are set such that roads and expressways  are\r\n\r\nneither  overly  congested  nor  under  utilised.  If  so,  then\r\n\r\nadjustments  to  the ERP rates will have to be made  to  achieve\r\n\r\nbetter  traffic conditions.  Over time, traffic conditions  will\r\n\r\nalso  change. ERP rates must respond accordingly.  To make  full\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  flexibility of the ERP system, reviews of  traffic\r\n\r\nconditions will be carried out regularly and rates adjusted,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LTA has noted that the traffic patterns in the CBD and\r\n\r\nexpressways  have  stabilised.  It is  currently  reviewing  the\r\n\r\nrates  to bring about more optimal use of the roads.  Where  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  roads are under-utilised, ERP rates will be  lowered.\r\n\r\nConversely,   where   and   when  the  congestion   levels   are\r\n\r\nunacceptable,  the  rates  will be adjusted  upwards.  LTA  will\r\n\r\nfinalise  the changes in the ERP rates and announce the  details\r\n\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cost-cutting measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in response to Mr Cyrille Tan, let me stress that\r\n\r\nwe  must  not  mix the objectives of ERP with that of  the  cost\r\n\r\ncutting  measures  that  Government  is  implementing  to   help\r\n\r\nbusiness.   With the ERP, we can rely more on usage measures  to\r\n\r\nmanage  traffic and this will allow us to further reduce upfront\r\n\r\ntaxes  like ARF.  Indeed, the sooner and the more fully the  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem is implemented, the more leeway the Government will  have\r\n\r\nto  reduce  these statutory charges on vehicles, and  hence  the\r\n\r\noverall cost of owning vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me end by saying that the greatest contribution of\r\n\r\nthe  ERP  system really is its ability to keep our  roads  free-flowing,  in  an  efficient and effective manner.  We  take  our\r\n\r\ntraffic  conditions  for granted. Yet, many  cities  around  the\r\n\r\nworld are grappling with the problem of congestion and the costs\r\n\r\nit  imposes  on  their economies and their  societies.  The  ERP\r\n\r\nsystem  that  Singapore has put in place  after  many  years  of\r\n\r\nplanning and implementation has been acknowledged and recognised\r\n\r\nby  international traffic management experts and  policy  makers\r\n\r\nas an effective and fair way to solve the problem of congestion.\r\n\r\nSo,  let me take this opportunity to acknowledge the efforts and\r\n\r\nthe  contributions of all those responsible for successfully and\r\n\r\nsmoothly   implementing   the   ERP   system,   especially   the\r\n\r\ncontractors,  the media, the staff and all motorists  for  their\r\n\r\nunderstanding and cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> The Minister has said that\r\n\r\nthe  CTE has become more congested. What is the Government doing\r\n\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, we have just spent the last eight years\r\n\r\ntrying  to solve the problem of congestion through ERP. I  think\r\n\r\nthe  CTE  problem  is  a  unique one which  has  to  be  tackled\r\n\r\nspecifically  because  the  other two  expressways  are  not  so\r\n\r\ncongested.   LTA  will be looking at this in  closer  detail  in\r\n\r\nterms of the types of vehicles using it and the times they are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nusing  it.  LTA will then make the necessary adjustments to  ERP\r\n\r\nrates in order to smoothen the flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The problem is probably due to too many COEs\r\n\r\nbeing  released. There are too many cars on the road.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhy you are getting congestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I am glad to hear the Member talking\r\n\r\nabout  car  population  control as  one  of  the  ways  to  ease\r\n\r\ncongestion on our roads.  Because that is precisely what we  are\r\n\r\ndoing.  We are using the COE system as well as the ERP system to\r\n\r\ncontrol congestion on our roads. One or the other alone will not\r\n\r\ndo.  So  ERP alone is not going to solve the problem. COEs  plus\r\n\r\nERP will solve the problem. I would like to thank the Member for\r\n\r\nre-emphasising  that  point.  But having said  that,  the  total\r\n\r\nnumber  of  COEs  being  issued is based on  very  rough  global\r\n\r\nestimates of how many cars Singapore roads can accommodate.   As\r\n\r\nto  where and when these cars travel, I think it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  us  to determine how many COEs should be issued for  people\r\n\r\nliving in Potong Pasir, for example, because they happen  to  be\r\n\r\ncongesting the CTE.  But I think the ERP will solve the  problem\r\n\r\nof localised congestion, whether it is on the CTE.  So if we use\r\n\r\nboth  these  measures judiciously, COEs to control  overall  car\r\n\r\npopulation and ERP to control localised congestion, I  think  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able,  most  of  the time, to control  the  congestion\r\n\r\nproblem  in  Singapore.  I say \"most of the time\" because  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  other situations when there are traffic  jams  due  to\r\n\r\naccidents, bad weather and so on, which are beyond our control.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask the Minister whether he would agree that the ERP system will\r\n\r\nactually  transfer loading of the transportation cost  from  the\r\n\r\nnon-business  sector to the business sector.   In  the  process,\r\n\r\nactually the cost to the business sector is increased, which  in\r\n\r\nturn  is  against  the current Government's intention  to  lower\r\n\r\noverall business cost for the business sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I dispute that entirely because, as I\r\n\r\nhave   indicated,   for   the  bulk  of  the   industry,   their\r\n\r\ntransportation  costs have actually been lowered.   There  is  a\r\n\r\nsmall  sector  of the business community which depends  on  very\r\n\r\nfrequent  use of ERP-controlled roads which will see an increase\r\n\r\nin  their  transportation cost.  I think it is inevitable  in  a\r\n\r\nsituation  like  this that there will be some  businesses  which\r\n\r\ncannot  lower  their transportation cost, even if  they  try  to\r\n\r\nchange  their travel patterns, but these are, I submit,  in  the\r\n\r\nminority.   The indications are that the bulk of businesses  are\r\n\r\nactually  saving  and some of them are saving  very  substantial\r\n\r\namounts.   So, the question really is: what do we  do  with  the\r\n\r\nvery  small percentage of businesses which are affected by  this\r\n\r\nhigher  business  cost?  I would say that the first  thing  that\r\n\r\nthey  would have to do is to relook at their business conditions\r\n\r\nand see whether there is a way for them to reduce cost by making\r\n\r\nless  use  of  ERP-controlled roads, by  changing  their  travel\r\n\r\npatterns,  by relooking at the total logistics system.   But  we\r\n\r\ncannot  change the entire system just because a small percentage\r\n\r\nof  the  business community is adversely affected.  Indeed,  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  ERP  is  successfully keeping  our  traffic  flowing\r\n\r\nsmoothly  is benefiting the overall business community.   If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  ditch  that, how is it going to help  Singapore,  when\r\n\r\nroads are heavily congested, when people take inordinate amounts\r\n\r\nof  time to get to work or meetings, when goods are stuck on the\r\n\r\nway  to  the  port and to the airports or on their  way  to  the\r\n\r\nfactories?   I  think the cost to Singapore will be  much,  much\r\n\r\nhigher, especially the cost to business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, I understand that\r\n\r\nsince  the  implementation of the ERP, there is  a  shortage  of\r\n\r\ntaxis  in  the  CBD.   For  businesses like  taxis  and  courier\r\n\r\ncompanies, I do not know whether it is possible for the Minister\r\n\r\nto  impose a certain maximum deduction from the ERP cashcard per\r\n\r\nday,  so  that we cap their  cost for entering the CBD per  day.\r\n\r\nThis would help them to contain their cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is that since the ERP started, the ring\r\n\r\nroads around the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCBD   like  Scotts  Road,  for  example,  which  is  within   my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  have  been really congested  during  the  daytime\r\n\r\nwhereas Orchard Road, which is just around the corner, is empty.\r\n\r\nIt  appears  to  me that actually there is a bit  of  mispricing\r\n\r\nproblem.

In so far as capping the maximum amount  of  ERP\r\n\r\nrates  is  concerned, to do that would be defeating the purpose,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  idea  of  charging  per  pass  is  really  to  let\r\n\r\nindividual  motorists who are passing through  the  gantry  take\r\n\r\nconsidered decisions as to whether they wish to make that number\r\n\r\nof  trips  or not.  As I indicated earlier, there will  be  some\r\n\r\nbusinesses including taxis which will be making multiple passes.\r\n\r\nBut  for  taxis,  if  they pass through with  a  passenger,  the\r\n\r\npassenger  is the one who is paying.

On average, 95% of eligible  voters\r\n\r\ncast  their  votes in elections.  The system achieves  foolproof\r\n\r\nvoter verification.  Except for the blind, every voter marks his\r\n\r\nballot  paper himself.  There is complete transparency,  because\r\n\r\ncandidates  and  their  polling  and  counting  agents  can   be\r\n\r\nphysically  present  to witness the voting  and  vote  counting.\r\n\r\nThere  is  also absolute security of the cast ballots, from  the\r\n\r\npolling station all the way to the counting table.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department has studied the issue of overseas\r\n\r\nvoting  since  1983,  and examined how other  countries  do  it.\r\n\r\nThere  are  various  methods  -  voting  in  overseas  missions,\r\n\r\nelectronic  voting,  postal voting, or proxy  voting.   However,\r\n\r\neach has limitations and operational difficulties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We only have 26 overseas missions. Many electors will not\r\n\r\nlive  or  work close enough to one of them to go there to  vote,\r\n\r\nespecially in a large country like China or the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic voting looks attractive, but at present still\r\n\r\nhas fundamental technical deficiencies.  Elector verification is\r\n\r\nnot  foolproof,  and there is no trail or hard evidence  like  a\r\n\r\nmarked ballot paper to refer to in case of a dispute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overseas voters are a very small minority. Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment  estimates that only 3.5% of electors are  unable  to\r\n\r\nvote  because they are overseas.  It is therefore better not  to\r\n\r\ncomplicate  the voting system for the sake of this small  number\r\n\r\nof electors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the issue is not just numbers or operational\r\n\r\ndifficulties.   The 3.5% of Singaporeans who  are  overseas  are\r\n\r\naway for various reasons.  1.4% are away on holiday and 0.7% are\r\n\r\nstudying  overseas.  The remaining 1.4% are  working  or  living\r\n\r\nabroad.  Some are on overseas postings, perhaps working for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  for Singapore companies in their regionalisation\r\n\r\nefforts.   But  others have emigrated.  They may be  waiting  to\r\n\r\ntake up foreign citizenship, or they may have gone abroad\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany years ago and lost touch with events back home, even though\r\n\r\nthey have not given up their Singapore passport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case for overseas voting is stronger for some of these\r\n\r\ngroups  than  for others.  But, in practice, it is difficult  to\r\n\r\ndistinguish between them.  So we have kept the requirement  that\r\n\r\na  Singaporean must return home to vote, as a practical test  of\r\n\r\nwhether he still maintains his links to Singapore and will  make\r\n\r\nthe effort to exercise his duties as a citizen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has therefore decided not to implement\r\n\r\na  system for overseas voting.  However, it recognises that this\r\n\r\nis   not   a   static   situation.   With  globalisation,   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will work abroad, and the case for overseas  voting\r\n\r\nmay  change.

On 17th September  this  year,\r\n\r\nMalaysia   informed  the  Ministry  of  Defence  that   it   was\r\n\r\nterminating  various agreements and arrangements  governing  the\r\n\r\nRSAF's  use  of  Malaysian airspace.

Today, the RSAF  conducts\r\n\r\nits training and operational flights with the same frequency and\r\n\r\ntempo  as  before.  RSAF aircraft proceeding to  their  training\r\n\r\nareas  no  longer  transit through Malaysian airspace  but  take\r\n\r\nalternative  routes.  In doing so, we have  not  compromised  on\r\n\r\nsafety.   The RSAF has been working closely with CAAS to  ensure\r\n\r\nthe  proper sequencing of RSAF flights and civil air traffic  so\r\n\r\nthat air safety is not compromised.  We have also minimised  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  RSAF  flights  over built-up  areas.   However,  the\r\n\r\nadjustments  in  flight paths could mean some  inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nthose living on both sides of the Johor Straits as more aircraft\r\n\r\nnow  have  to  fly over Singapore's territorial  waters  in  the\r\n\r\nStraits.

We will continue  to  look  for  new\r\n\r\ntraining  areas  in other parts of the world.  In  addition,  we\r\n\r\nhave  invested heavily in advanced training simulators.

It transfers  POSBank's\r\n\r\nexisting  property, rights and liabilities to DBS,  excluding  a\r\n\r\nlist   of   assets  and  liabilities  and  makes  the  necessary\r\n\r\narrangements for the transfer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government announced the privatisation of POSBank and\r\n\r\nits  acquisition by DBS for $1.6 billion on 24th July 1998.  DBS\r\n\r\nwill  pay  for it with new non-voting convertible DBS preference\r\n\r\nshares.  I  would  now  take  the House  through  the  rationale\r\n\r\nunderlying the privatisation of POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for privatisation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank was set up in 1972. Its specific purpose was to promote\r\n\r\nthrift and saving among Singaporeans. POSBank has fulfilled this\r\n\r\nfunction very well. The objective of encouraging savings remains\r\n\r\nvalid  today.   However,  the banking  environment  has  changed\r\n\r\nsubstantially since POSBank's inception more than 25 years  ago.\r\n\r\nThe large mass of depositors now have access to the local retail\r\n\r\nbanks,  which are able to offer them a full range of competitive\r\n\r\nservices.  Not being a commercial bank, POSBank cannot offer the\r\n\r\nfull  range of services such as fixed deposits, foreign currency\r\n\r\ndeposits,  asset  management services and so on.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  it is facing tough competition in its core business,  ie,\r\n\r\nits  deposit-gathering business, which it is  not  in  a  strong\r\n\r\nposition to counter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank's depositors have become more sophisticated. As other\r\n\r\nbanking  avenues have opened up, they are much more  aware  that\r\n\r\nthey may be better served elsewhere.  For instance, when the gap\r\n\r\nin  interest  rates  on  savings deposits  between  POSBank  and\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks  increased last year,  these  depositors  were\r\n\r\nquick to move their deposits to the commercial banks.\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  concluded that the idea of a  limited  function\r\n\r\nsavings  bank is largely out of step with the times.  There  can\r\n\r\nbe  a continuing role for POSBank, but only if it is competitive\r\n\r\nwith full banks.  We believe that enabling it to compete as a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1026</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfull  bank  via  merger with DBS is the best way forward.   This\r\n\r\nwould   enable  Government  to  lift  the  fetters   that   have\r\n\r\nconstrained  its  operations and distorted  market  signals  and\r\n\r\nconsumer behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also useful to note that most developed countries, and\r\n\r\nmany  of  our Asian counterparts, no longer operate post  office\r\n\r\nsavings banks or national savings banks. The list includes  USA,\r\n\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Norway\r\n\r\nand  Germany's national savings banks are also being privatised,\r\n\r\nwith  commercial banks likely to take control.  In  the  region,\r\n\r\nonly  India,  Japan and Thailand still operate national  savings\r\n\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Transitional arrangements</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax exemption on POSBank deposits is one example of how the\r\n\r\nconstraints  on  POSBank,  built up over  time,  had  led  to  a\r\n\r\nsituation where our regulations increasingly risked losing their\r\n\r\noriginal purpose.  The reason for granting POSBank's tax  exempt\r\n\r\nstatus was to encourage small depositors to save.  However, over\r\n\r\nthe  years, personal income tax rates have been brought down  to\r\n\r\nsuch a degree that nowadays, most small depositors no longer pay\r\n\r\nany  income  tax, and so do not benefit from the tax  exemption.\r\n\r\nPOSBank's data show that some 85% of their depositors do not pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax.   The tax exemption therefore ended  up  benefiting\r\n\r\nonly  15%  of  POSBank's  depositor base,  primarily  the  large\r\n\r\ndepositors with high income and high marginal income tax  rates.\r\n\r\nThis is not the group that the tax exempt status was intended to\r\n\r\nhelp.   We  are therefore no longer serving the original  policy\r\n\r\nintent.    To  compound  the  problem,  Government  had  imposed\r\n\r\nconstraints  on POSBank's investment and lending  activities  in\r\n\r\nthe  belief that POSBank's tax exempt status should not unfairly\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  the  commercial  banks.   This  led   to   product\r\n\r\nlimitation,  low  savings  interest  rates,  and   a   lack   of\r\n\r\nalternative  uses  for its deposits. This in  turn  resulted  in\r\n\r\nCredit  POSB  pricing its mortgages below market rates,  in  its\r\n\r\ndrive  to  gain market share within POSBank's limited  scope  of\r\n\r\nbusiness.  In\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neffect,  the  good  intentions of  the  tax  exempt  status  had\r\n\r\nresulted  in Government providing subsidised mortgage  financing\r\n\r\nfor private housing. This was not Government's intention.  There\r\n\r\nis little public policy justification for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that these market distortions have to\r\n\r\ngo.    However,  to  ease  the  burden  of  adjustment  in  this\r\n\r\nprivatisation  exercise,  we  are taking  care  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\npainful  disruptions for POSBank's depositors and borrowers  are\r\n\r\nminimised.   We therefore set out a transitional arrangement  to\r\n\r\nhelp all parties adjust over time.   For depositors, the removal\r\n\r\nof  tax exemption will be phased over a period of six years;  it\r\n\r\nwill be entirely removed only from 1st January 2005 onwards.  To\r\n\r\nease  the  burden  of  adjustment for  existing  borrowers,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  asked  DBS  to maintain  the  differential  gap\r\n\r\nbetween POSBank and DBS mortgage rates of between 1.5% and 1.75%\r\n\r\nuntil the end of 1999, and thereafter to close it gradually over\r\n\r\na  three-year  period.  This four-year transition is  more  than\r\n\r\nfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>No better alternative to merging with DBS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A viable future for POSBank requires it to be competitive with\r\n\r\nfull  banks.  But the financial services environment today is  a\r\n\r\nvery  tough  place. With rapid developments in the  variety  and\r\n\r\ncomplexity  of  financial  products,  banks  can  only   compete\r\n\r\neffectively by having the strength to carry increased market and\r\n\r\ncurrency  risks,  and  larger asset size to  reap  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale. This is why the Government has been encouraging our local\r\n\r\nbanks  to  consolidate.  Within this framework,  it  makes  most\r\n\r\nsense for POSBank to merge with a successful local bank than  to\r\n\r\nstrike out on its own.  This route would best enable it to serve\r\n\r\nits  customers better.  This would of course also help  set  the\r\n\r\npace for the other banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS was a natural choice as the most suitable partner for\r\n\r\nPOSBank.  Since the Government is a major shareholder of DBS, it\r\n\r\ncan  be  more  confident that DBS will preserve  the  spirit  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank's\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1028</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocial  responsibilities.  The merger  will  at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nsignificantly   strengthen  Singapore's   banking   sector   for\r\n\r\ninternational competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Specific provisions of the Bill</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now proceed to explain the specific key provisions\r\n\r\nof the Bill, which are:\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(a)   Clauses 3 and 18: Transfer/Dissolution dates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the usual practice of dissolving the statutory\r\n\r\nboard  and  simultaneously  transferring  all  the  assets   and\r\n\r\nliabilities to the successor company, the transfer date and  the\r\n\r\ndissolution  date will be distinct. This is to allow  Government\r\n\r\nto  comply  with  Presidential safeguards on the  protection  of\r\n\r\nreserves, which will be covered in the Second Reading speech  on\r\n\r\nthe Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No.  2)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(b)  Clause 4(3): Excluded assets and liabilities</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS will not be taking over all the undertakings of POSBank in\r\n\r\nthis transaction. There will be some assets and liabilities left\r\n\r\nwith the Government, including the POSBank Tower and some equity\r\n\r\nand  bond  investments. DBS has asked the Government  to  retain\r\n\r\nPOSBank Tower, which is still under construction, as DBS has  no\r\n\r\nneed  for another large Headquarters Building. The equities  and\r\n\r\nbonds  held back by the Government are to enable DBS  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  section  31  of the Banking Act, which requires  that  the\r\n\r\ninvestments  of  a  bank should not exceed 40%  of  its  capital\r\n\r\nfunds.  The  assets retained by Government amount  to  about  $1\r\n\r\nbillion.  The list to be specified under this clause spells  out\r\n\r\nthe  assets  and  liabilities that are  being  retained  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment;  all  other assets and liabilities will  legally  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to DBS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(c)   Clause  7(7):  Supplementary provisions on disclosure of information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secrecy provisions contained in section 47 of the Banking\r\n\r\nAct,  which  does  not apply to POSBank prior to  the  transfer,\r\n\r\nforbids banks to reveal any information on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  customers' accounts, unless, among other conditions,  the\r\n\r\ncustomer  or  his  personal representatives  had  given  written\r\n\r\npermission  to do so.  Therefore, POSBank's terms and conditions\r\n\r\nfor  its  accounts  as  well as Credit POSB's  loan  agreements,\r\n\r\nunlike the commercial banks, generally do not contain disclosure\r\n\r\nauthorisation  clauses.  The POSBank accounts, including  Credit\r\n\r\nPOSB's  loan portfolio, to be transferred to DBS will be subject\r\n\r\nto  this provision.  Like most banks, DBS obtains its customers'\r\n\r\nwritten  consent as a standard feature in its account  documents\r\n\r\nand  loan  agreements.   To put POSBank customers  on  the  same\r\n\r\nfooting  as  existing  DBS customers, DBS  can  write  to  every\r\n\r\nPOSBank  customer to seek written permission, but  it  would  be\r\n\r\nobviously  impractical to do so.  There  is  no  guarantee  that\r\n\r\nthese  customers  will agree or even bother  to  reply  to  give\r\n\r\nconsent.    This  clause  therefore  allows  DBS   to   disclose\r\n\r\ninformation  only  for the administration of POSBank  customers'\r\n\r\naccounts,  and only insofar as it is in line with DBS'  existing\r\n\r\npractice.   I should point out that in practice, this clause  is\r\n\r\nnot  a  material change because POSBank has had,  and  has  been\r\n\r\ndisclosing  such  information to third parties all  these  years\r\n\r\nwhere  required in the normal course of its work.  The  proposed\r\n\r\namendment  essentially  ensures  that  DBS  would  be  able   to\r\n\r\nadminister the POSBank accounts after the transfer, in a  manner\r\n\r\nwhich   complies   with  the  Banking  Act  and   with   minimal\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  POSBank's 3 million customers,  so  that  the\r\n\r\ntransfer of POSBank to DBS is as seamless as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(d)       Clause 8: Staff provisions.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with other privatisation exercises, all POSBank and\r\n\r\nCredit POSB staff would cross over to DBS at existing terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions of service.  DBS has stated that, as far as possible,\r\n\r\nit  will retain and re-train POSBank staff, to provide them with\r\n\r\nbetter prospects and broader career opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(e)       Clause 15: Consideration shares.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS' purchase consideration would be offered to the\r\n\r\nGovernment in the form of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnon-voting preference shares, instead of ordinary voting shares.\r\n\r\nThese preference shares enjoy the same dividend rate as ordinary\r\n\r\nshares.   They  will  not be listed on the Stock  Exchange,  but\r\n\r\nwould  be convertible to ordinary shares which can then be sold.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Government has committed not to sell  the  shares\r\n\r\nuntil  2002  at  the earliest.  The preference  shares  will  be\r\n\r\nconvertible on a 60(Local):40(Foreign) ratio so as not to  upset\r\n\r\nthe existing Local/Foreign tranche balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(f)       Clause 18: Repeal of the POSBank Act.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will repeal most sections of the existing POSBank\r\n\r\nAct  with  effect  from  the Transfer  Date.   However,  certain\r\n\r\nsections  of  the Act will still be retained, and will  only  be\r\n\r\nrepealed  upon  POSBank's Dissolution Date.  This  is  to  allow\r\n\r\nPOSBank to remain as a shell statutory board to see through  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of its residual assets and to finalise any  management\r\n\r\nissues remaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(g)        Clause 19 and the Schedule: Consequential amendments to other laws.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Income Tax Act will be amended to allow for the\r\n\r\nextension of tax exemption on POSBank savings deposits, for both\r\n\r\nexisting and new POSBank accounts.  Consequential amendments are\r\n\r\nalso made to other Acts.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the object of this\r\n\r\nBill  is to implement the Government's decision to allow DBS  to\r\n\r\nbuy  POSBank.  As explained by the Minister, this move to  merge\r\n\r\nthe   two  large  Government-owned  financial  institutions   is\r\n\r\nmotivated  by the desire to create a new super Singaporean  bank\r\n\r\nto  support  and  spearhead the plan  to  push  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nregional  financial centre.  My view is that this objective  can\r\n\r\nbe  supported.  A larger, better capitalised Singapore bank will\r\n\r\ntherefore  have  better  resources to compete  in  the  regional\r\n\r\nmarkets.  Local depositors will also get to enjoy a wider  range\r\n\r\nof financial services and facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the merger of POSBank with DBS will mean the\r\n\r\ndissolution  of  one  of  the most loved and  trusted  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in Singapore.  The POSBank has been  a  symbol  or\r\n\r\nicon  of  the  virtue  of thrift in Singapore.   We  lament  the\r\n\r\npassing  of  this powerful icon of thrift for Singaporeans.   We\r\n\r\ncan recall the days in the seventies when as young students,  we\r\n\r\nwere  encouraged by our schools and parents to save a little  of\r\n\r\nour  daily pocket money and deposit them into POSBank.  Over the\r\n\r\nyears, we have learnt to save and put out trust in POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of DBS and POSBank would mean that a larger bank\r\n\r\nwill serve the local depositors.  But I would like to point  out\r\n\r\nthat  a  larger  bank  does  not necessarily  equate  to  better\r\n\r\nfacilities  or  a  safer  bank  for  depositors.   Allow  me  to\r\n\r\nelaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there will be better resources and with more\r\n\r\nadvanced  computer technology, the enlarged DBS can create  more\r\n\r\nservices and facilities.  However, many of the original  POSBank\r\n\r\ncustomers, especially the older folks, would not go near an  ATM\r\n\r\nand  they  would prefer their monies to be put and  recorded  in\r\n\r\nPOSBank  passbooks, instead of holding them as  passcards  which\r\n\r\nthey  cannot read and see.  The POSBank customers are also quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the service provided by the friendly  smiles  of\r\n\r\nthe  POSBank tellers and the 133 conveniently located  branches.\r\n\r\nThis large pool of housewives and older folks do not need better\r\n\r\nservices.   They are indeed very happy enough with  the  present\r\n\r\nservices of POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also does not mean that a super bank is a safer bank.\r\n\r\nSuper  banks  can make super mistakes.  There were instances  of\r\n\r\nlarge  banks  around the world, eg, in America,  Europe,  Japan,\r\n\r\nwhere they have to be rescued by the government on the brink  of\r\n\r\ncollapse.  Hence, many of our local depositors see the  POSBank,\r\n\r\nwhich is Government-owned and Government-backed, as a AAA credit-rated  savings bank that they can trust fully.  Now the enlarged\r\n\r\nDBS  may  not  give  them the same sense of  security.   POSBank\r\n\r\ndepositors do not mind the slightly lower\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterest  rates  in  return  for  better  security  and   better\r\n\r\nconvenience, and they can sleep well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As reported in the press, DBS' acquisition of POSBank has\r\n\r\nraised two main concerns.  One is the possibility of higher home\r\n\r\nloan  interest rates and the loss of the Government's  guarantee\r\n\r\non  deposits  which  POSBank offers.  The Minister  has  just  a\r\n\r\nmoment  ago  explained  how DBS will take  certain  measures  to\r\n\r\nalleviate the above worries of depositors.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan do more.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Post Office Savings Bank is an\r\n\r\ninstitution  in  Singapore  which  is  synonymous  with  saving.\r\n\r\nSaving  is, of course, a virtue which the State should inculcate\r\n\r\namong its citizens.  The State wants its citizens to save.  That\r\n\r\nis  why it gives incentives for people to save.  The deposits in\r\n\r\nthe POSBank accounts are tax exempt up to a limit.  Almost every\r\n\r\nman  in  the street in Singapore in his lifetime has  a  POSBank\r\n\r\nsavings  account.  But with the merger, the image of the POSBank\r\n\r\nas  the  people's  bank  shall be taken away.   The  tax  exempt\r\n\r\nconcession  enjoyed by Singaporeans for the last 26 years  shall\r\n\r\nalso come to an end, except for those below 21 years of age  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  serving National Service.  This concession  has\r\n\r\nvery little benefit because most of those who are below 21 years\r\n\r\nof  age have not started working.  As for those serving National\r\n\r\nService, their NS pay is very low.  Hence, even if they save the\r\n\r\nwhole  of their NS allowance, the amount of interest accrued  is\r\n\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the tax concession given to those below 21\r\n\r\nyears  of  age  and  those serving NS is insignificant  and  not\r\n\r\nmeaningful.  The people who are most unhappy are the people  who\r\n\r\nhave taken loans from Credit POSB to buy homes of their own  and\r\n\r\nfuture purchasers of property for their own use.  The POSBank is\r\n\r\na  source  of  cheap  funds for people who want  to  purchase  a\r\n\r\nproperty.  The difference of interest rate between that  offered\r\n\r\nby  Credit  POSB and the commercial bank is about 1.5%.   Credit\r\n\r\nPOSB's rate is lower than the commercial banks' rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the high property prices, up to January of last\r\n\r\nyear,  the  amounts borrowed by home purchasers are  very  high.\r\n\r\nThe  monthly  interest paid is correspondingly high.   The  home\r\n\r\nowners have to seek loans from private commercial banks when the\r\n\r\ngrace  period  given by Credit POSB ends on 31st December  2002,\r\n\r\nand they have to pay substantially more.  It was reported in the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times  of 28th July 1998 that home owners  had  to  pay\r\n\r\nbetween  $78 and $103 more a month for every $100,000 loan  when\r\n\r\nCredit  POSB's  cheap  housing loans are  phased  out  by  2002,\r\n\r\nprovided interest rates remain the same.  Those who have taken a\r\n\r\n25 or 30 years' loan shall be the most hard hit as their monthly\r\n\r\nrepayment amounts are higher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the economic downturn and property values have also\r\n\r\nnose-dived,  the banks are not going to show magnanimity.   They\r\n\r\nwant  their customers to top up or make bigger monthly repayment\r\n\r\namounts.  In one Straits Times' report, a borrower was asked  by\r\n\r\nthe  bank  to  pay  $4,000 more each  month.   This  may  be  an\r\n\r\nexception  but such horror stories go to make people aware  that\r\n\r\nonce property prices fall, all kinds of hardship can occur.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the bad economic situation, I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  extend  the grace period  of  increasing  the\r\n\r\ninterest rates of Credit POSB to those of the commercial ones to\r\n\r\nsix years rather than four years.\r\n\r\nAs  regards  the  purchase of POSBank  by  DBS,  newspapers  had\r\n\r\ncommented  that DBS got POSBank rather cheaply at $1.6  billion.\r\n\r\nThe  purchase price paid by DBS for POSBank is 1.37 times of its\r\n\r\ntangible  asset  value, and this is said to be below  the  norm,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  about  2 to 2.5 times for banks.  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister why is the takeover of\r\n\r\nPOSBank  taking place at this point of time.  Has DBS  lost  too\r\n\r\nmuch money in its overseas investments and needed help?  We  all\r\n\r\nknow that POSBank has about $25 billion of depositors' cash.  Is\r\n\r\nDBS  eyeing  that  amount of money to bail  itself  out  of  its\r\n\r\nlosses?  I wish the Minister could enlighten us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me\r\n\r\nthis  opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I am in support of  the\r\n\r\nBill,  although I have some reservations with some clauses which\r\n\r\nI will come to later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposed merger of the Post Office Savings Bank with\r\n\r\nthe  Development  Bank of Singapore has drawn a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\npublic interest.  This is because POSBank has been regarded as a\r\n\r\nnational  institution.  Though the Act came into being  only  25\r\n\r\nyears ago, the institution has existed for almost a century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us remember starting our savings through the Post\r\n\r\nOffice  bank accounts.  In the early days, we used to buy stamps\r\n\r\nand  we would stick them to a book.  Of course, new Members  may\r\n\r\nnot  realise it, but this is the way we were encouraged to save.\r\n\r\nSir, a larger question that the House would be interested in  is\r\n\r\nthat,   in  the  interest  of  the  financial  institutions   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  banking industry in  particular  -  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned this earlier and I reiterate - we should have not more\r\n\r\nthan  two to three banks, and the signal should be sent  to  the\r\n\r\nother  banks  that they should consider merging in  the  greater\r\n\r\ninterest  of financial institutions in Singapore. This trend  is\r\n\r\nseen all over the world, in USA and Japan.  In fact, recently in\r\n\r\nIndia, there was a report on banking. They too encourage merger.\r\n\r\nI  think it is timely. Of course, I share some of the grievances\r\n\r\nMr Chiam has mentioned earlier.  I urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthe grace period.  He has asked for six years.  I think it is  a\r\n\r\nfair figure.  At least it should be more than four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, members of the public have asked why is there a need\r\n\r\nto  have  this merger now.  Is it to bolster the DBS'  financial\r\n\r\nposition?  The Minister should state the position to this  House\r\n\r\nso  that, once and for all, we have these doubts cleared in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question which many people have asked is why did\r\n\r\nPost  Office  Savings  Bank  go with  DBS,  and  why  not  other\r\n\r\ncommercial  banks.  This is like a marriage. You do not  propose\r\n\r\nyourself to many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuitors.  You  look for suitors and then decide.  Both  of  them\r\n\r\nshare  a  common background, being Government-linked  companies.\r\n\r\nSo  I do not see any wrong. In fact, it is quite appropriate for\r\n\r\nthese two institutions to merge and the public should take it in\r\n\r\nthis spirit.  I am sure when the other banks are going to merge,\r\n\r\nthey  would  merge with those banks which are near and  dear  to\r\n\r\nthem.  They are not going to marry somebody who is not close  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another aspect which I would urge the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  convey to DBS. I have been a user of  Post  Office\r\n\r\nSavings Bank, and the friendly service is something which I hope\r\n\r\nwould  be  continued  by DBS so that the man-in-the-street  will\r\n\r\nfind the service as good, if not better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join\r\n\r\nin the debate on the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed a pity to dissolve POSBank. POSBank has\r\n\r\ntremendous historical value, a long history, and a lot of people\r\n\r\nare  associated with it.  If you ask the account holders whether\r\n\r\nPOSBank should be closed, I can tell you that they will say that\r\n\r\nit  should be kept going.  And I feel, at this stage, it is more\r\n\r\nimportant to see that we do not short-change the account holders\r\n\r\nof POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are about 3 million POSBank account holders and\r\n\r\nthat  is  a tremendous following which we should recognise.   We\r\n\r\nalso  know  that POSBank has been making money and  for  a  bank\r\n\r\nwhich has been making money, I do not understand the reason  why\r\n\r\nit  should  be  closed down.  I could understand  the  need  for\r\n\r\namalgamation.   But  if  we  so  decide  to  amalgamate,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  to  look  at this transition to  ensure  that  the  3\r\n\r\nmillion  account  holders  are to an extent  supported  and  the\r\n\r\ntransition does not bring serious impact on them and  they  will\r\n\r\nsupport  the change.  This is a crucial issue that the  Minister\r\n\r\nshould  look  into.   I see that there are many  people  in  the\r\n\r\nworking  class  who  are  associated  with  POSBank  and   their\r\n\r\nsentiments\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand loyalty should be appreciated.  I hope DBS will continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide the same service and maintain the relationship that  has\r\n\r\nbeen  established with many people in the working class who  are\r\n\r\naccount holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank, as Members know, has a very wide reach. It\r\n\r\nreaches  the  old,  the young, and the housewives  in  the  many\r\n\r\nhousing  estates.   And I hope that with this amalgamation,  DBS\r\n\r\nwould be able to find the same reach to the neigbourhoods in the\r\n\r\nhousing estates.  There are concerns that the reach may  not  be\r\n\r\nthere  and  it may cause dislocation, particularly to the  older\r\n\r\naccount  holders,  and the young ones too.  POSBank  has  become\r\n\r\nvery  visible.  If you move around the various housing  estates,\r\n\r\nyou  will find POSBank in many locations, and that is the widest\r\n\r\nreach that we should look at.  That would be the objectives  for\r\n\r\nwhich banks should strive to meet and it is important to look at\r\n\r\nthe dislocation it would cause as a result of this change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several implications that one needs to pay\r\n\r\nattention  to.   One is the service charge, ie, whether  service\r\n\r\ncharge  to  small account holders could be reviewed and  whether\r\n\r\nDBS could be advised that the service charge would not be raised\r\n\r\nunnecessarily at the expense of the small account holders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, housing loan. It is very important to examine\r\n\r\nthe  housing  loan issue because many of those  who  have  taken\r\n\r\nhousing  loans with the expectation that loan changes would  not\r\n\r\nbe  that  dramatic.  I personally feel that  the  terms  of  the\r\n\r\nhousing  loans  of  these  people  should  be  honoured.     The\r\n\r\nagreement  which they have entered with Credit  POSB  should  be\r\n\r\nhonoured by DBS itself, at least for a longer period.  For these\r\n\r\npeople, there should be no changes in loan terms which have been\r\n\r\naccorded by Credit POSB. That I think would be keeping  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith with these people who have taken their housing loans  with\r\n\r\nCredit POSB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area is to ensure that the banking service to\r\n\r\nordinary account holders, particularly the old, young and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchildren,  would not be displaced as a result of these  changes.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  would  be  taken into  serious  account  in  this\r\n\r\ntransition.  The Minister should ensure that DBS looks into  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of support for the ordinary account holders  who  have\r\n\r\ngiven well-established support over a long period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I rise to support\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.  I am pleased that, despite the trying times that our\r\n\r\neconomy is going through, the Government  has the foresight  and\r\n\r\ndetermination to ensure that Singapore comes out of this  crisis\r\n\r\nstronger  and better able to meet the challenges of the changing\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commercialisation of POSBank is timely as it forces our\r\n\r\nGLCs  and our banking system to be more efficient, enabling  the\r\n\r\ndomestic  market  to employ capital more effectively  so  as  to\r\n\r\ncompete on the same footing as the larger players in the  global\r\n\r\nmarket.   We  cannot afford to allow subsidies in  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ncapital  to  distort investment decisions of our  GLCs  or  even\r\n\r\npurchase  considerations of individuals financing  their  homes.\r\n\r\nOur  GLCs  would  have  to be able to make commercial  decisions\r\n\r\nbased  on market realities so as to realise their full potential\r\n\r\nand  not  be  molly-coddled  by  easy  access  to  cheap  funds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, cheaper access to credit from Credit POSB could  have\r\n\r\ncontributed to the present housing market over-shooting  in  the\r\n\r\nmid-1990s with the resultant effect being a drag on the  economy\r\n\r\nand on the individuals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In specific, Sir, the resultant DBS-POSBank entity would\r\n\r\nhave  the capacity to undertake larger projects as Asia rebuilds\r\n\r\nitself  and serves as a spur to encourage other Singapore  banks\r\n\r\nto  consolidate in line with the global trends in the  financial\r\n\r\nindustry.   It  is indeed critical that for Singapore  to  be  a\r\n\r\nmajor  financial  centre, we should have the  infrastructure  in\r\n\r\nplace  and  the underlying efficiency in our domestic banks  and\r\n\r\nthe  capital markets to cater for this development. The sale  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank  to DBS would serve as a catalyst and as a spring  board\r\n\r\nfor faster progress in these fields.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1038</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been some disquiet over the specifics relating to\r\n\r\nthe  sale  of  POSBank to DBS.  Most of the public concerns  are\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the possible rise in the cost of servicing their\r\n\r\nCredit  POSB  mortgages.  I am appreciative that the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  mandated  DBS  to start re-pricing the  mortgage  rates  to\r\n\r\nmarket  levels only from the end of 1999 onwards over  the  next\r\n\r\nthree  years, as the Minister has explained.  Effectively,  this\r\n\r\nallows  for  a  four-year transition period and  presumably  the\r\n\r\nMinister is assuming that economic recovery will happen, perhaps\r\n\r\nin the Year 2000, for this transition period to take place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By removing subsidies across all levels and benefiting the\r\n\r\nmajority  of POSBank depositors, the Government has indeed  been\r\n\r\nvery  astute  in nipping a potential problem in  the  bud.  This\r\n\r\ncould ensure that our financial system remains strong, our banks\r\n\r\nremain  healthy and we can thus avoid the pitfalls of  potential\r\n\r\nbank  failures that are dragging down some of the  economies  in\r\n\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, given that there is no clear end to the current\r\n\r\neconomic crisis, I want to ask the Minister whether it would  be\r\n\r\npossible  to  have perhaps a caveat or provision put  in  place.\r\n\r\nThat   caveat  or  provision  is  that  the  present   four-year\r\n\r\ntransition period will hold, subject to a review at the  end  of\r\n\r\n1999  whereupon, if the economic crisis worsens or deepens,  and\r\n\r\nif  economic  recovery  is  further  delayed,  then  extend  the\r\n\r\ntransition  period accordingly, beyond four years,  maybe  five,\r\n\r\nsix,  seven or eight years.  I believe this would alleviate some\r\n\r\nof the present concerns of the public over the commercialisation\r\n\r\nof POSBank as it would be a clear indication that the Government\r\n\r\nis prepared to be flexible should circumstances require.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, whilst the Bill deals extensively with the transfer of\r\n\r\nbusiness  undertakings to DBS, there is no mention in  the  Bill\r\n\r\nwith regard to the tenure of employment for employees of POSBank\r\n\r\nsave  to  say  that the existing employment contracts  would  be\r\n\r\ncontinuing under the DBS entity.  Would the Minister consider it\r\n\r\nnecessary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto include provisions in the Bill for POSBank employees in order\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  their  employment interests  in  this  period  of\r\n\r\nuncertainty,  at  least for a minimum period of  one  year,  ie,\r\n\r\nwould the Minister ensure that these POSB employees would not be\r\n\r\nretrenched  for  at  least a period of one  year  following  the\r\n\r\nmerger of the two banks?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Minister has said that POSBank was offered only to\r\n\r\nDBS  as  the  latter bank was the natural choice  because  of  a\r\n\r\ncommon  denominator - Government ownership.  May I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  give  a  full explanation on  this,  because  the\r\n\r\nconcern  of  the  public, the citizens at  large,  is  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  could  have  obtained a  higher  price  for  POSBank\r\n\r\nthrough a more transparent and open tender system, and this will\r\n\r\nbenefit the majority of the taxpayers.  Would the Minister  shed\r\n\r\nmore light on this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the Minister has given us\r\n\r\na  compelling  economic case for the acquisition of  POSBank  by\r\n\r\nDBS.  Liberalisation of the financial services sector under  the\r\n\r\nauspices  of  WTO and information technology will  redefine  the\r\n\r\nnature  of banking and the recent mega-mergers in North  America\r\n\r\nand  Europe  are  symptomatic of these changes.   Therefore,  an\r\n\r\nentity  with  the  combined strength of  DBS  and  POSBank  will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be in a better position to compete in this brave  new\r\n\r\nworld  of  financial services.  And that is why I  support  this\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothwithstanding, these forceful cerebral arguments, it is\r\n\r\nwith  a  tinge of sadness and nostalgia that I join this debate.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Minister's speech sounded much like a requiem for  a\r\n\r\nnational  institution.  POSBank, as many of my  colleagues  have\r\n\r\nalready  said, has been an indelible part of Singaporeans'  life\r\n\r\nand  it has offered a friendly and non-threatening face in  what\r\n\r\nwould  otherwise be a cool, if not cold, world of banking.   And\r\n\r\nthis  has encouraged many, including the young and perhaps those\r\n\r\nnot so accustomed to the world of finance, to take up savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of POSBank by DBS begs the question how the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  ensure that savings and thrift continue  to  be\r\n\r\npromoted amongst Singaporeans, particularly the young.   One  of\r\n\r\nthe  key lessons of the current regional economic crisis is  the\r\n\r\nvalue  of  savings and the habit of thrift.  We can  argue  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  more sophisticated but even in  sophisticated\r\n\r\neconomies, saving is not a necessary factor of their lives.   It\r\n\r\nis  important  that we continue to imbue our  young  with  these\r\n\r\nvalues.  I do not mean to suggest that commercial banks  do  not\r\n\r\ndo  this but this is not their raison d'etre.  After all, we  do\r\n\r\nnot  hear  commercial banks telling us or urging us to save  for\r\n\r\ntomorrow because tomorrow is worth saving for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the point of tax exemption and the liberalisation of\r\n\r\nmortgage  rates,  as  I  understand it, tax  exemption  will  be\r\n\r\ncompletely  lifted  from  1st January 2005.   Tax  exemption  on\r\n\r\ninterest earned on POSBank savings deposits will continue on all\r\n\r\ndeposits till the end of December 2001 and thereafter,  it  will\r\n\r\nbe extended to the first $100,000 in the balance of each POSBank\r\n\r\nsavings  account depositor.  This means that this merged  entity\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy a subsidy of sorts from the Government till the  end\r\n\r\nof 2004, albeit at reducing levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Credit POSB's home loan mortgage rates\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to gradually rise to competitive market  rates\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January 2000.  Sir, I wonder whether it is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  Credit  POSB's  mortgage rates to be sustained  at  current\r\n\r\nlevels vis-a-vis DBS' commercial rates, at least until the first\r\n\r\ntier  of  tax  exemption is removed on 1st January 2002.   After\r\n\r\nall, I think the bank enjoys a certain subsidy and it seems  out\r\n\r\nof sync that, on the one hand, the banks receive a subsidy which\r\n\r\nwill   be  gradually  removed  but,  on  the  other  hand,   the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of its mortgage rates is executed  much  earlier.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if the Minister could comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to declare my interest as an employee of\r\n\r\nTemasek Holdings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport this Bill.  Nevertheless, there are some concerns  which\r\n\r\nI  would like to raise for the Minister's consideration  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the provisions of this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of the POSBank will be a social and historical\r\n\r\nmilestone.  Singaporeans will have many sentimental memories  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank,  which has been the national savings bank for  decades.\r\n\r\nSet  up by the British in 1877, it was operated as an arm of the\r\n\r\nPost  Office and intended to be the poor man's bank.  The modern\r\n\r\nPOSBank began on 11th July 1966 with an initial staff of 35  and\r\n\r\nbecame  a statutory board in 1972.  It played an important  role\r\n\r\nin  the shaping of Singapore as we see it today, particularly in\r\n\r\namassing  the  small savings of individuals in the whole  nation\r\n\r\nfor  the  building of national infrastructure.  As  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues  have  also  pointed out,  the  POSBank  was  a  non-intimidating place in the neighbourhood where those without very\r\n\r\nmuch  money could go in to obtain banking services without  fear\r\n\r\nof embarrassment, humilation or having to be sophisticated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bank's objective was clearly defined in 1872 as, \"to\r\n\r\nencourage those in receipt of small incomes to practise  economy\r\n\r\nby  affording them a safe investment for small amounts at a fair\r\n\r\nrate  of interest, and also of affording borrowers opportunities\r\n\r\nof  obtaining  loans  at  lower  rates  of  interest  than  were\r\n\r\nprocurable from other sources.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Post Office Savings Bank Act, which will be\r\n\r\nrepealed today if the Bill is passed, the principal objective of\r\n\r\nthe  Bank shall be \"to provide means for the deposit of  savings\r\n\r\nand  encourage  thrift;  to mobilise domestic  savings  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  public  development .\"   The  corporate  policy  of\r\n\r\nPOSBank  has  been  reaching  a  maximum  number  of  people  by\r\n\r\nproviding  services and incentives in a number of areas  related\r\n\r\nto  the  promotion of the savings habit.  Basic banking services\r\n\r\nare  made easily accessible to the public and convenience to the\r\n\r\nconsumer  is  a  cornerstone of that policy, with  branches  and\r\n\r\nautomated teller machines (ATMs) in practically every corner  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  especially in the Housing and Development  Board\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as 1983 actually, the Government had already\r\n\r\nconsidered  converting the POSBank into a full commercial  bank.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a review, the plan was not proceeded with, as  it\r\n\r\nwas  not in the national interest then.  Throughout its history,\r\n\r\nthe  POSBank  has  been  a  key  institution  of  our  financial\r\n\r\nindustry,  innovating and pushing the development  of  services,\r\n\r\nsuch  as the ubiquitous ATM we have now and the NETS card,  when\r\n\r\nthe  commercial banks were cautious, reluctant or  perhaps  even\r\n\r\napathetic to the use of new technology and services.  They  were\r\n\r\nable  to  see  the wider national interest untrammelled  by  the\r\n\r\ndesire  of  their shareholders to minimise risk  and  costs  and\r\n\r\nmaximise profit; and they had vast resources to implement  their\r\n\r\ndreams.   If one were to look at this solution that is proposed,\r\n\r\nwe  could  actually  view  this as the final  sacrifice  of  the\r\n\r\nPOSBank  for  the national interest to make our Singapore  banks\r\n\r\nfit  to  fight the wars that are coming up in the global economy\r\n\r\nthat  is broadening.  But perhaps it is still necessary for some\r\n\r\ninstitution  that  could serve this role of a  catalyst  in  the\r\n\r\nbanking  industry  to prod and goad the other banks  into  doing\r\n\r\nthings  that  they  perhaps  are reluctant  to  do  for  various\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for the acquisition of the POSBank by DBS have been\r\n\r\nmentioned by the Minister.  Effectively, the Minister says  that\r\n\r\nthere  are two choices: one is to amend the Post Office  Savings\r\n\r\nBank Act to give the Post Office Savings Bank wider latitude  to\r\n\r\noffer  full banking services; and the other is to merge  with  a\r\n\r\ncommercial  bank because in this world that we  have  now,  size\r\n\r\ndoes matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These objectives laid down by the Minister in his speech are\r\n\r\nlaudable  objectives, but this does not mean that the objectives\r\n\r\nof  the  POSBank  I have enumerated earlier are irrelevant  now.\r\n\r\nThe  POSBank  may  need to re-engineer itself  in  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest for the new millennium and the era of the international\r\n\r\nmega-banks.   But we must find alternative sources  of  low-cost\r\n\r\nloans  and  safe investments for the millions of  small  account\r\n\r\nholders, the 92,000 small and medium enterprises and the  23,000\r\n\r\nhawkers and other sundry shopkeepers\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  stallholders.  For these people, the POSBank has met  their\r\n\r\nneeds  very well and these are not very sophisticated needs  and\r\n\r\nthey see no reason to dissolve the POSBank.  There is after  all\r\n\r\nstill  a  social objective that a national institution like  the\r\n\r\nPOSBank can serve, the social initiative of promoting thrift and\r\n\r\nsaving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister to educate the public on the existence of\r\n\r\nthe  other  financial institutions which we  have  and  which  I\r\n\r\nbelieve will be more than happy to move into the gap left by the\r\n\r\nPOSBank.   These are the institutions such as NTUC Income,  NTUC\r\n\r\nThrift  and Loan Society and the numerous other thrift and  loan\r\n\r\nsocieties,   credit  unions  and  cooperatives   in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlternative  financial institutions like these  should  also  be\r\n\r\npromoted,  allowed to expand if need be, be given tax exemptions\r\n\r\nand  the  rules  for their setting up liberalised  so  that  the\r\n\r\noriginal  objectives  of  the  POSBank,  ie,  promoting  thrift,\r\n\r\nsavings,  safe  investments and low-cost  loans  for  the  small\r\n\r\nincome  earners,  all  these  would  remain  possible  in  these\r\n\r\ntroubled economic times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to its impact on the employees of the POSBank, I am glad to\r\n\r\nnote  that  clause 8 of the Bill provides that  these  employees\r\n\r\nwill be absorbed into DBS on the same terms as they received  in\r\n\r\nthe POSBank.  This is important as they had many of the benefits\r\n\r\nof  statutory board employees which they will now lose with  the\r\n\r\nmerger if not for clause 8.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another concern which is not reflected in the Bill and\r\n\r\nthis relates to the down-sizing and possible retrenchment of the\r\n\r\nPOSBank  employees, as some of my colleagues in this House  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.  I hope the Minister will assure this House  that  no\r\n\r\nundue  economic hardship will be laid on the shoulders of  these\r\n\r\nemployees.  Besides retraining them for new jobs, perhaps a  job\r\n\r\nplacement  service could also be initiated to  assist  in  their\r\n\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laud the Minister for the various plans he has already put in\r\n\r\nplace to phase in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe changes such as higher commercial lending rates and the loss\r\n\r\nof  tax  exemption,  and  for gingerly  balancing  the  national\r\n\r\ninterest  against the interest of the small account holders  and\r\n\r\nsmall  businessmen, so as to smoothen the unhappiness and sorrow\r\n\r\nat losing a  key national institution which, in the public mind,\r\n\r\nhas  not  lost its relevance yet.  But I wish to call  for  more\r\n\r\npractical steps to allay the fears of consumers that they  would\r\n\r\nsoon  be  put in severe financial straits and be made  bankrupt.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this may be to allow the novation or assignment of\r\n\r\nthe  POSBank  loans to selected thrift and loan societies  where\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances permit it, rather than force all the accounts\r\n\r\nto be transferred to DBS.  This gives the consumer the choice of\r\n\r\nthe financial institution he wishes now to put his trust in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future, Mr Speaker, Sir, is a frightening prospect, and even\r\n\r\nbig  banks  in  other countries have collapsed, as  some  of  my\r\n\r\ncolleagues have mentioned in their earlier speeches.  I urge the\r\n\r\nMinister to ease the pain for the POSBank small account  holders\r\n\r\nand  employees.  Ease them gently into the dark night that  they\r\n\r\nface and give them a strong light to guide them through.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acquisition of the POSBank came as a surprise to most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   For the keen observers of the financial  sector,\r\n\r\nthis acquisition may have been anticipated once the Keppel Bank-Tat  Lee  Bank merger was announced.  A merger of smaller  banks\r\n\r\nand  the  bigger ones is also the new paradigm of the  financial\r\n\r\nservices  review  that  is  being spearheaded  by  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.  Given the global mega-merger of big banks, one cannot\r\n\r\ngo  against the trend if banks in Singapore are to survive.  The\r\n\r\nmerger of the Dutch POSBank with NMB Bank and subsequently  with\r\n\r\nNationale  Netherland to form the ING group in  Europe  and  the\r\n\r\nTravellers Group with Citibank in America are examples  of  this\r\n\r\nglobal trend.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discussed this subject with Dr Wang Kai Yuen, who is a\r\n\r\nboard  member of the POSBank since 1987, and he communicated  to\r\n\r\nme  many of his views, and I share his views.  They are all very\r\n\r\nvaluable.   So  some of the comments that I make here  are  also\r\n\r\nshared by Dr Wang.  I have heard comments that the Government by\r\n\r\nselling POSBank has given up its role in promoting the habit  of\r\n\r\nsaving  amongst Singaporeans.  I do not agree with that  as  the\r\n\r\npromotion of the saving habit is already deeply enshrined in our\r\n\r\nCPF  policy.  To promote saving in the form of a savings account\r\n\r\nis a task that now rests on the shoulders of the private sector.\r\n\r\nIn  its public statements, Mr  Dhanabalan, the Chairman of  DBS,\r\n\r\nhas  said  that POSBank will continue in this role by  providing\r\n\r\nbasic  banking  services  at affordable  charges.   Indeed,  for\r\n\r\nchildren,  students  and  full-time national  servicemen,  these\r\n\r\nservices will be free.  Moreover, I would like to point out that\r\n\r\nthe idea of privatising an organisation like POSBank is not new.\r\n\r\nThere  is a global trend, as more and more governments  find  it\r\n\r\nmore  efficient to focus on the business of the government while\r\n\r\nprivatising  other  functions such  as  running  their  national\r\n\r\nsavings bank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1980s, the idea of corporatising POSBank was\r\n\r\nactively  evaluated.   It  received  strong  support  from   the\r\n\r\nmanagement  and  staff  of the bank.  I believe  this  idea  was\r\n\r\nscuttled when it met strong opposition from the local commercial\r\n\r\nbanks  who felt that a corporatised POSBank would provide unfair\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Singaporeans, on first hearing of the acquisition of\r\n\r\nPOSBank  by DBS, lamented the demise of POSBank.  Paradoxically,\r\n\r\nthis is also the strongest endorsement of the Bank.  POSBank has\r\n\r\nbeen  relentless  in  its  pursuit to  provide  outstanding  and\r\n\r\nconvenient  service  to all its customers, including  the  small\r\n\r\ndepositors.   From a discussion with Dr Wang, I learned  that  a\r\n\r\nthird  of POSBank's customers, including children, students  and\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, have deposits of $100 or less.  In fact,  over\r\n\r\n90%  of POSBank's deposit base is contributed by only 20% of the\r\n\r\ncustomers.  Therefore,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPOSBank's accounts are being subsidised.  Moreover, the cost  of\r\n\r\nservicing these accounts has been escalating all these years, as\r\n\r\ncosts  of  ATMs,  staff and premises have gone up  relentlessly.\r\n\r\nPOSBank  could  not  have  gone  on  subsidizing  such  a  large\r\n\r\nproportion of its depositors.  The House might be interested  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  the  Bank had been considering  for  some  time  the\r\n\r\nrecovery  of  a portion of these costs from its customers.  Some\r\n\r\nmeasures  have already been taken, for example, GIRO charges  on\r\n\r\nservice providers and charge for coin exchange.  More were being\r\n\r\ncontemplated.  As I have indicated earlier, whether  POSBank  is\r\n\r\nmerged  or  not,  the days of free services  from  POSBank  were\r\n\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the POSBank has been outstanding in providing\r\n\r\nservice,  it has not been able to match the commercial banks  in\r\n\r\nproviding its depositors with a better rate of return.  This  is\r\n\r\nso  because the investment avenues open to POSBank were severely\r\n\r\nlimited  by  the  Ministry of Finance which is  not  surprising,\r\n\r\nbecause the deposits are guaranteed by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect customers' funds, the investments had to be safe\r\n\r\nand these usually yielded lower returns.  The interest earned by\r\n\r\nPOSBank's  customers is tax-free.  To level the  playing  field,\r\n\r\nPOSBank  penalised  its  bigger  customers  by  giving  a  lower\r\n\r\ninterest  rate  for  deposits in excess of  $100,000.   This  is\r\n\r\ncounter intuitive if the goal is to attract more customers  with\r\n\r\nbigger  deposits.  This principle was laid down by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance in 1978 and remained unchanged for nearly 20  years.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,   the  environment  has  changed.   Tax   rates   for\r\n\r\nindividuals  have  come  down.  Taxes have  gone  up.  What  was\r\n\r\nconsidered  a  lot of money in the past is no longer  that  much\r\n\r\ntoday.  Singaporeans  have become more  sophisticated  in  their\r\n\r\nbanking  needs.  There are also more investment options open  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Therefore, POSBank's two-tier interest rate structure was\r\n\r\nreversed  in  the earlier part of this year, the better  reward,\r\n\r\nthe  bigger  depositors.  Not responding to changes  would  have\r\n\r\nbeen suicidal in today's most competitive environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, POSBank has been constrained in its\r\n\r\nresponse  to  changes. The growing financial  sophistication  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  POSBank's limited product range  has  already\r\n\r\nreduced  its market share of deposits.  If this trend continues,\r\n\r\nthe  Bank's relevance in the lives of Singaporeans will diminish\r\n\r\nover time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major complaints from Singaporeans regarding the\r\n\r\nacquisition of POSBank is the prospect of paying higher mortgage\r\n\r\nrates  for  their  Credit  POSB's  housing  loans.   The  merger\r\n\r\nagreement stipulated a time-table for the mortgage rates to move\r\n\r\nprogressively towards the market levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to Dr Wang who told me that the difference between\r\n\r\nthe  rate of Credit POSB and that of DBS today is between  1.25%\r\n\r\nand  1.5%.   As  the  loan base of Credit  POSB  is  about  $7.6\r\n\r\nbillion,  this could potentially mean an additional  revenue  in\r\n\r\nthe  region of between $95 million and $114 million per year for\r\n\r\nDBS  if the rates were completely equalised.  I mention Dr  Wang\r\n\r\nhere because he had to go to Hong Kong with DPM.  Therefore,  he\r\n\r\nis  not  in  this House.  So some of the points I have mentioned\r\n\r\nhere were also his.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, those who have borrowed from Credit POSB, including Dr\r\n\r\nWang  himself, will feel the pinch of the higher mortgage rates.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we should consider this fact.  Most of the  depositors\r\n\r\nof  POSBank  live in HDB flats. They obtain their housing  loans\r\n\r\nfrom HDB. All the borrowers of Credit POSB are owners of private\r\n\r\nproperties,  like condominiums and landed-properties.   Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nYong Kian, Press Secretary to the Minister for Finance, gave the\r\n\r\nfollowing figures in the Straits Times Forum Page reply of  20th\r\n\r\nAugust 1998:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The average Credit POSB loan is $460,000. Out of the\r\n\r\n10,900  granted  in  the last two years,  1,650  loans  exceeded\r\n\r\n$750,000 or 650 exceeded $1 million.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Fong that there is no justification for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to provide these borrowers mortgage loans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat below market rates.  I think it is hard to argue the merit of\r\n\r\nmaintaining the lower than market interest rates of Credit  POSB\r\n\r\nwhich  benefit private property owners and give a  higher  yield\r\n\r\nfor their depositors who are largely HDB residents.  There is an\r\n\r\nargument  that  lower  mortgage rates help Singaporeans  to  own\r\n\r\nhomes.   But  we  must bear in mind that these Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\nalready in the higher income bracket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share Dr Toh See Kiat's concern. Because POSBank is\r\n\r\na  statutory  board  it could place national interest  ahead  of\r\n\r\ncommercial  considerations in many of its operational decisions.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, it has always taken the lead to bring innovations\r\n\r\nand introduce IT to banking in Singapore.  POSBank was the first\r\n\r\nlocal  bank to computerise its savings accounts records, thereby\r\n\r\npaving the way for on-line banking.  POSBank introduced GIRO  to\r\n\r\nSingapore in 1974, and direct salary crediting as early as 1972.\r\n\r\nPOSBank pioneered the concept of the self-service banking, being\r\n\r\nthe  first  local bank to introduce the ATM in 1979, a  passbook\r\n\r\nupdating facility in 1993, and a cheque book dispenser in  1995.\r\n\r\nEven  now,  POSBank is piloting a three-in-one ATM which  allows\r\n\r\ncash   deposits  and  passbook  updating  in  addition  to  cash\r\n\r\nwithdrawals,  all  in one machine.  In this way,  POSBank  is  a\r\n\r\nprime  mover  of  new banking innovations and performs  national\r\n\r\nservice.   I  am concerned that in future no banking institution\r\n\r\nwill  be playing this catalyst role.  This is important.  Unless\r\n\r\nwe  keep  on  harnessing technology to innovate and improve  our\r\n\r\nproductivity,   we   run   the  real  danger   of   losing   our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness and not achieving our objective of becoming  the\r\n\r\npremier financial centre in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by extending my deepest\r\n\r\nappreciation  to the POSBank staff, past and present,  who  have\r\n\r\nbuilt  up the Bank from its humble beginnings to the pre-eminent\r\n\r\nposition it enjoys today.  We were all once POSBank's savers.  I\r\n\r\nam  concerned  that  this sterling service will  not  always  be\r\n\r\nremembered by all Singaporeans they have served all these years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, globalisation is\r\n\r\nhere  to  stay. The present crisis is only a correction  to  its\r\n\r\nunrelenting  growth.  Current oppositions to  its  progress  are\r\n\r\njust  aberrations.  They will be smoothened out in  due  course.\r\n\r\nThe process will roll along after this interruption.  Hence, our\r\n\r\npolicies are sound and we should stay the course.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will in the future be merged more closely with\r\n\r\nthe   world  financial  system.   Foreign  banks  and  financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions   will  make  their  way  here.   Our   banks   and\r\n\r\ninstitutions must in turn venture abroad.  The competition, both\r\n\r\nat  home and abroad, will become more intense.  Size will  be  a\r\n\r\nfactor in the competition.  For a population of just under  four\r\n\r\nmillion, the number of local banks and financial institutions is\r\n\r\ntoo  many.  They are also small in comparison to those who  come\r\n\r\nin  from  overseas.  I therefore support the merger of  DBS  and\r\n\r\nPOSBank, and hence the Bill standing before the House.  However,\r\n\r\nit  is important to note that this merger came about not because\r\n\r\nthe  POSBank  is  no longer viable.  It is to  prepare  for  the\r\n\r\ncoming   competition.    POSBank  is  a  relevant   and   useful\r\n\r\ninstitution  to  Singaporeans.  It is thus  important  that  the\r\n\r\nmerger  does not result in the disappearance of unique functions\r\n\r\nand activities that it provides to the people in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now re-emphasise a few of them which several of my hon.\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  the House have already spoken  on.   POSBank  is\r\n\r\nrecognised as the bank of the ordinary people.  Anyone, rich  or\r\n\r\npoor,  young  or old, can open an account.  You do not  have  to\r\n\r\nhave a lot of money in the account.  This is not how other banks\r\n\r\noperate.   In recent years, many banks have openly discriminated\r\n\r\nagainst  the  less  wealthy.  If you do not maintain  a  minimum\r\n\r\nmonthly  average  of  typically a thousand  dollars,  a  service\r\n\r\ncharge  will be levied.  Their justification is that it  is  not\r\n\r\nprofitable  to  provide such accounts.  It  is  well-known  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are a people who save their money. The  POSBank,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve,  has  much  to do with Singaporeans  having  this  good\r\n\r\nsaving  habit.   No matter how much you have, you  can  squirrel\r\n\r\nthem into your\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPOSBank  account.   To  make it easy  for  the  people,  POSBank\r\n\r\nbranches sprout out all over the island.  Over time, the amounts\r\n\r\nin  these small accounts built up.  Campaigns were developed  at\r\n\r\nthe  young and adult population.  I believe that profit  is  not\r\n\r\nthe  driving  force underlying the operations of POSBank.   Will\r\n\r\nthis  national  effort go the way of the  dodos  if  the  profit\r\n\r\nmotivation of banks takes precedence?  Society will rue the  day\r\n\r\nwhen this happens.  Unfortunately, this harmful effect will only\r\n\r\nbe seen in the long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see another useful role the POSBank has played. Besides\r\n\r\ngiving  voice to the ordinary Singaporeans, it has also  spurred\r\n\r\nthe  services the bank provides to the people.  By  providing  a\r\n\r\nreasonable alternative to the commercial banks, this  must  have\r\n\r\nput  a  cap  to  the  charges that they have  imposed  on  their\r\n\r\nservices.   Due to the high quality of services the POSBank  has\r\n\r\nprovided,  this  must have spurred the other banks  to  also  up\r\n\r\ntheir  services.   What  will replace this  benchmark  with  the\r\n\r\nmerger?  I would urge DBS to identify these unique functions and\r\n\r\nservices  of  POSBank.  These are strengths of  POSBank.   Those\r\n\r\nthat  are  needed  by the ordinary people and are  deserving  of\r\n\r\npreserving should be preserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank all the\r\n\r\nMembers  who  have spoken in support of the Bill, especially  Dr\r\n\r\nTan  Cheng  Bock  who, in fact, answered half  the  questions  I\r\n\r\nintend  to  answer.   I particularly join him  in  thanking  the\r\n\r\nPOSBank's staff for their sterling service over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one feature which has been commonly raised by all Members\r\n\r\nhere  who have spoken today is the seeming loss of an icon,  and\r\n\r\nthere  is  some suggestion that somehow after the  merger,  POSB\r\n\r\njust  fades  away.  I can assure Members that is not  the  case.\r\n\r\nThe merger or the combination of these two banks achieves a very\r\n\r\nimportant objective.  It is Government's policy to encourage the\r\n\r\ngrowth   of   strong  Singapore  banks,  and   this   particular\r\n\r\ncombination  is  a beginning, so that we have a  Singapore  bank\r\n\r\nwhich can compete effectively in the region and in the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POSBank was chosen to be married to DBS because they have\r\n\r\ncomplementary  strengths.   POSBank  has  a  very  large  retail\r\n\r\nnetwork  and extensive coverage.  Therefore, it is an  excellent\r\n\r\nretail  bank  serving  a  whole  spectrum  of  small  and  large\r\n\r\ncustomers.   On the other hand, DBS is a very strong  commercial\r\n\r\nbank with strong corporate accounts.  So the merger and the  fit\r\n\r\nis  excellent.  And I can assure the House that it  is  not  the\r\n\r\nintention  of DBS - I hope they remember this - to make  POSBank\r\n\r\ndisappear.  Instead, it will build on its strength to retain all\r\n\r\nthe   good  features  of  POSBank  in  order  to  add   to   its\r\n\r\nattractiveness as a combined bank.  Certainly the  network,  the\r\n\r\nATMs,  will  be maintained and DBS has assured us that  it  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to provide services for the small depositors and indeed\r\n\r\nchildren  up to 12 years, students up to 21 years and  full-time\r\n\r\nNational  Servicemen will all continue to  be  able  to  have  a\r\n\r\nPOSBank  account without a service charge.  In addition,  it  is\r\n\r\nalso   undertaking  to  retain  all  POSBank  staff  on  current\r\n\r\nconditions and there would be no redundancies.  Of course,  they\r\n\r\ncannot  guarantee  this over the long term,  because  conditions\r\n\r\nchange.   But  there is no intention of letting  anybody  become\r\n\r\nredundant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share his sentiments about the loss of an icon. It is indeed\r\n\r\nan   institution  which  is  so  well  known  that  you  see  it\r\n\r\neverywhere.  But it is just the thought of an icon lost, because\r\n\r\nmany  features of the icon will remain, including the  logo  and\r\n\r\nthe quality of service which POSBank has built up.\r\n\r\nAnother  question  asked by Members was why Government  selected\r\n\r\nDBS as the marriage partner instead of getting the best value by\r\n\r\ntendering  the  POSBank  to  all.   The  reason  is  that   this\r\n\r\nparticular  merger  did not start off with a  purely  commercial\r\n\r\nintent.   We  were  not  out  to maximise  the  profits  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The objective, as I have explained earlier, was  to\r\n\r\nbuild  on  Government's  wish  to  develop  a  strong  bank   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  at the same time we wanted to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nrange  of  POSBank's  services would be  maintained  as  far  as\r\n\r\npossible.  Of course,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nover  time,  some things will have to change but, by and  large,\r\n\r\nthe best features will be maintained for as long as feasible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combined bank, headed by DBS, will ensure that POSBank's\r\n\r\nsocial  functions are retained, and this includes the  provision\r\n\r\nof affordable banking services to small depositors. DBS has also\r\n\r\nagreed  to  phase down the mortgage rates currently extended  to\r\n\r\nCredit  POSB's borrowers over an extended period of  time.   The\r\n\r\ntax  exemption features of POSBank will also be phased out  over\r\n\r\nsix  years.  These concessions will allow DBS to commit  to  the\r\n\r\nmaintenance of POSBank's social function as part of the purchase\r\n\r\nand sales agreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some concern has been expressed as to why the tax exemption\r\n\r\nperiod  should not be extended.  I think six years is more  than\r\n\r\nadequate - three years of tax exemption for all POSBank deposits\r\n\r\nfollowed  by another three years of tax exemption for the  first\r\n\r\n$100,000 of deposits.  It is only by the year 2005 that all  tax\r\n\r\nexemption is entirely removed.  We cannot allow, of course,  the\r\n\r\ncombined  bank  to enjoy tax exemption indefinitely  because  it\r\n\r\nwould be unfair to the other commercial banks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Credit POSB's mortgage interest rates which\r\n\r\nare now between 1.5% and 1.75% lower than commercial bank rates,\r\n\r\nwe  have  said  that  Government's policy is  not  to  subsidise\r\n\r\npurchasers  of  private  property.   Government  subsidies   for\r\n\r\nhousing are extended through the HDB housing programme and  this\r\n\r\nis  unaffected by the changes in Credit POSB's mortgage interest\r\n\r\nrates.   Dr  Tan  Cheng Bock has already quoted  some  published\r\n\r\nfigures which show that the great bulk of the borrowings through\r\n\r\nCredit  POSB  is  by  people  buying  condominiums  and  private\r\n\r\nproperties  in  the  range of $460,000,  going  as  high  as  $1\r\n\r\nmillion.   Persons with loans of this size are clearly not  from\r\n\r\nthe  low-income  groups  and it is not  Government's  policy  to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to subsidise such loans indefinitely.  The reason  why\r\n\r\nthey  are currently enjoying lower interest rates is because  of\r\n\r\nthe  special  circumstances of POSBank in which restrictions  on\r\n\r\nits investment opportunities have driven them to gain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarket  share  in  the  housing loan market  by  offering  lower\r\n\r\nmortgage interest loans through Credit POSB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A phase-down period of four years is considered to be\r\n\r\nreasonable.  The request for the phase-down to be extended  from\r\n\r\nfour  years to six years, in case the downturn should go  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  four-year  period, would not be fair in that the  four-year\r\n\r\nphase-down was agreed by DBS at the time the sales agreement was\r\n\r\nsigned  in July.  Changing the terms now would impose an  unfair\r\n\r\nnew burden on POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if the economic situation in Singapore should\r\n\r\nremain bad or even deteriorate after the four-year grace period,\r\n\r\nwe would all indeed be in very serious trouble, in which case it\r\n\r\nis  not just the Credit POSB's borrowers which Government  needs\r\n\r\nto help but the entire Singapore population.  So I think we will\r\n\r\nface  that problem when we see it.  I do not believe, therefore,\r\n\r\nwe should vary the terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal more specifically with the individual questions\r\n\r\nraised  by  Members, although some of these  have  already  been\r\n\r\ncovered by what I have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee wants to know whether the removal of\r\n\r\nGovernment's guarantee would mean that the new entity  would  be\r\n\r\nas  safe as POSBank.  Obviously, it cannot be as safe as a  100%\r\n\r\nGovernment guarantee.  But, in practice, I should point out that\r\n\r\nno  commercial bank has ever received a Government guarantee nor\r\n\r\ndoes  it need to do so in Singapore.  Singapore maintains a very\r\n\r\ntight  supervisory oversight on its commercial banks  and  banks\r\n\r\nare  encouraged  to  be  very careful on their  investments  and\r\n\r\nensure  that the security of their depositors' funds  is  always\r\n\r\nadequately looked after.  There is no reason for savers  in  the\r\n\r\nnew  bank to have concern over the potential for losses to their\r\n\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one issue which has not been raised, but I will mention\r\n\r\nhere, is that the MAS is studying the possibility of introducing\r\n\r\na  limited  form of deposit insurance for banks in Singapore  to\r\n\r\nprovide an added measure of protection for small\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndepositors.   This  would  be  in the  context  of  Government's\r\n\r\nintention  to  open up the domestic banking sector gradually  to\r\n\r\nmore foreign competition.  The issue is a complicated one and we\r\n\r\nwould  not want to rush into it.  But it is certainly an  option\r\n\r\nwe can consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Mr Chiam has misunderstood the tax exemption\r\n\r\nscheme.   The phase-out of tax exemption over six years  applies\r\n\r\nto  all  depositors, not just to persons below 21  and  national\r\n\r\nservicemen.  However, post merger, children, students  under  21\r\n\r\nand  full-time  national servicemen are the three categories  of\r\n\r\ncustomers  who  will  continue to be  allowed  to  open  savings\r\n\r\naccounts without a service charge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam also asked why POSBank was not sold by tender. I have\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier  that the sale was not treated  as  a  purely\r\n\r\ncommercial transaction.  In a sale by tender, POSBank  would  be\r\n\r\nsold to any bank which offered the highest price.  This was  not\r\n\r\nGovernment's intention.  We wanted to select a bank which  could\r\n\r\nbest  meet  and  implement our objectives. As Government  had  a\r\n\r\ncontrolling  interest in DBS, there was assurance that  DBS,  as\r\n\r\nthe acquiring bank, would be best placed to continue to maintain\r\n\r\nPOSBank's  social  obligations.  Once DBS was  selected  as  the\r\n\r\npotential partner, negotiations for the sale and purchase  price\r\n\r\nwas conducted along commercial lines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai recommends that after the merger, DBS should emulate\r\n\r\nPOSBank in providing a high quality of service to its customers.\r\n\r\nI  can  assure  him  that the intention is not  to  degrade  the\r\n\r\nquality  of service.  Instead, POSBank's quality image  will  be\r\n\r\npreserved, together with its coverage network.\r\n\r\nI think I have answered the question raised by Dr Vasoo.  I have\r\n\r\nalso  answered most of Mr Chew Heng Ching's questions, including\r\n\r\nthe question raised by Mr Iswaran.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Dr Toh See Kiat is satisfied with the answers I have\r\n\r\ngiven so far.

The  Fifth  Schedule  lists  six  key  statutory\r\n\r\nboards,  which are MAS, BCCS, HDB, CPF Board, JTC  and  POSBank,\r\n\r\nand  three Government-linked companies (GLCs) and these are GIC,\r\n\r\nMND  Holdings  and  Temasek Holdings, whose  past  reserves  are\r\n\r\nprotected by the Constitution.  These statutory boards and  GLCs\r\n\r\nare  required  by  the Constitution to ensure  that  their  past\r\n\r\nreserves are not drawn down without the approval of the  Elected\r\n\r\nPresident.  POSBank is presently in the Fifth Schedule. With its\r\n\r\nprivatisation and subsequent dissolution, POSBank will  have  to\r\n\r\nbe deleted from the Fifth Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the spirit of the Constitution, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  remove POSBank from the  Fifth  Schedule  only\r\n\r\nafter all of POSBank's assets have been transferred back to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and safeguarded in accordance with the  requirements\r\n\r\napplicable to Fifth Schedule entities. The President has  agreed\r\n\r\nto   this  arrangement.   The  transfer  will  be  done  in  the\r\n\r\nfollowings steps:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Two Bills have been tabled before Parliament, which\r\n\r\nare  the  Post  Office  Savings Bank of Singapore  (Transfer  of\r\n\r\nUndertakings and Dissolution) Bill and the Constitution  of  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of  Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill.  Both Bills  are\r\n\r\nto   be   read  for  the  Second  and  Third  time  at   today's\r\n\r\nParliamentary sitting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Once the President has assented to the Bills, the\r\n\r\nGovernment will bring into force the Post Office Savings Bank of\r\n\r\nSingapore (Transfer of Undertakings and Dissolution) Act  first,\r\n\r\nbut not the Constitution (Amendment No. 2) Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Government will then set the date for the transfer of\r\n\r\nthe  undertakings of POSBank to DBS at 16th November 1998.  This\r\n\r\nis the closing date for the transaction with DBS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) POSBank will still be in the Fifth Schedule on this\r\n\r\ntransfer date.  As the Government and POSBank are satisfied that\r\n\r\nthe  transfer of POSBank's undertakings to DBS is at fair market\r\n\r\nvalue,  and  thus  will  not result  in  any  drawdown  on  past\r\n\r\nreserves,  the  President's approval is  not  required  for  the\r\n\r\ntransaction.   Nevertheless, given the size  and  importance  of\r\n\r\nthis transaction, the Government has kept the President's Office\r\n\r\nfully  informed of the details of the transaction.  It has  also\r\n\r\ninformed  the President's Office that it will treat all proceeds\r\n\r\nreceived  from the sale of POSBank as the past reserves  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) On the transfer date, POSBank will receive new DBS shares\r\n\r\nas  consideration for transferring its undertakings to DBS.   It\r\n\r\nwill  also  still  have  residual  assets  that  have  not  been\r\n\r\ntransferred to DBS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) On or after the transfer date, all of POSBank residual\r\n\r\nassets and DBS shares will be transferred to the Government,  in\r\n\r\na  manner consistent with the constitutional safeguards.  I,  as\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance, will give an undertaking to the President\r\n\r\nin  accordance  with  Article  22B(9)  of  the  Constitution  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  assets,  (including all  the  new  DBS  shares)  which\r\n\r\ncomprise  POSBank's past reserves to the past  reserves  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   These  past reserves will  comprise  the  new  DBS\r\n\r\nshares, and part of POSBank's residual assets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) POSBank's current reserves will also be returned to the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Government will voluntarily treat these  assets\r\n\r\nreceived from POSBank as past reserves of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) We expect to finalise the audit of POSBank's residual\r\n\r\nassets,  seek  approval from the President's  Office  for  their\r\n\r\ntransfer  to the Government and effect the transfer by  December\r\n\r\n1998 or January 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) This will leave POSBank as an empty shell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) The Constitution (Amendment No.2) Act will then be brought\r\n\r\ninto  force  through  a Gazette Notification,  thereby  deleting\r\n\r\nPOSBank  from the Fifth Schedule.  As a final step, a  day  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  appointed  under  the  Post  Office  Savings  Bank  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  (Transfer  of Undertakings and  Dissolution)  Act  to\r\n\r\ndissolve POSBank.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, \"That the Bill be now read a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Division will be taken to ascertain that the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Bill is supported by the votes of not less  than\r\n\r\ntwo-thirds of the total number of elected Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  56  Members,  pursuant  to  Article  5(2)   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.

The Bill seeks to enhance\r\n\r\nHDB's  flexibility to raise loans from a wider range of  sources\r\n\r\nin any way it deems advantageous.  At present, HDB's development\r\n\r\nprogrammes and operational requirements are financed  mainly  by\r\n\r\nHousing Development Loans provided by the Government.  With  the\r\n\r\npassing of the Bill, HDB will launch its first bond issue in the\r\n\r\nlater  part  of this financial year to fund part of its  housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By tapping the bond market, HDB can reap the benefits of a more\r\n\r\nefficient   financing   structure  that  closely   matches   its\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure  needs.   The  issuing  of   bonds   by\r\n\r\nstatutory boards will also help broaden and deepen the Singapore\r\n\r\nbond market, adding to its diversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the protection of HDB flats owned by\r\n\r\nSingapore  permanent residents - clauses 6 and 10.  The  present\r\n\r\nAct  protects all HDB flats whether owned by Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\nor  Singapore permanent residents (PRs) from being vested in the\r\n\r\nOfficial Assignee following the bankruptcy of their owners.   It\r\n\r\nalso  provides that no HDB flat shall be sold by court order  to\r\n\r\nsatisfy  a  judgment  debt.  The Bill proposes  to  remove  such\r\n\r\nprotection  in  cases  where  HDB  flats  are  wholly  owned  by\r\n\r\nSingapore PRs.  We want to restrict the scope of the Act  in  so\r\n\r\nfar as the issue of immunity from insolvency law is concerned to\r\n\r\nmake a distinction between Singapore citizens and Singapore PRs.\r\n\r\nThe amendment will cover all Singapore PR flat owners regardless\r\n\r\nof  when they might have purchased their HDB flats.  However, it\r\n\r\nwill  apply only to persons who are declared bankrupt after  the\r\n\r\ncommencement of the amendment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third change is the acquisition of HDB flats for the purpose\r\n\r\nof the Main Upgrading Programme - clause 7.  The Bill also seeks\r\n\r\nto incorporate a new provision in the Act to confer upon HDB the\r\n\r\nlimited  power  to  acquire individual strata units  within  HDB\r\n\r\nbuildings  for  the  specific purpose of implementing  the  Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme (MUP).  This will be necessary in  order  to\r\n\r\nbuild additional features in some MUP projects.  For example, in\r\n\r\nblocks with no void decks, the ground floor units may need to be\r\n\r\nacquired and cleared in order to set up communal facilities  not\r\n\r\nprovided  for  in  the past, such as a kindergarten  or  an  old\r\n\r\nfolks'   corner.    Let  me  assure  Members   that   compulsory\r\n\r\nacquisition will be carried out only after careful evaluation of\r\n\r\nthe  various possible options.  Furthermore, the final  decision\r\n\r\nlies  with the residents of the block in question who will  vote\r\n\r\nfor  the  MUP  package  that they prefer.   The  flats  will  be\r\n\r\nacquired only if 75% or more of eligible voters are in favour of\r\n\r\na particular upgrading package which involves such acquisition.\r\n\r\nHDB  will give the affected lessees a fair compensation  package\r\n\r\nbased  on market value similar to that given under the Selective\r\n\r\nEn-Bloc Redevelopment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nScheme.   In this way, affected lessees will not lose out  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the compulsory acquisition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in addition to the three main amendments I have touched on,\r\n\r\nthe  Bill also includes administrative changes to enhance  HDB's\r\n\r\nenforcement  of  public housing rules and  policies.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nempowers the Minister to make rules to regulate the carrying out\r\n\r\nof  renovation  in  properties sold by HDB to ensure  compliance\r\n\r\nwith building and safety regulations. This is provided in clause\r\n\r\n4.   Next,  the  Bill empowers the Minister to  make  rules   to\r\n\r\nrequire that all agreements for private sales of HDB flats shall\r\n\r\nbe  in  a  prescribed form and that all other forms of agreement\r\n\r\nshall be void.  The purpose of this amendment is to protect both\r\n\r\nbuyers  and  sellers of HDB flats.   Another amendment  aims  to\r\n\r\ncurb speculation by providing that Sales and Purchase Agreements\r\n\r\nentered  into  before the seller has occupied the flat  for  the\r\n\r\nminimum occupation period shall be void.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve operational efficiency, the Bill allows HDB to\r\n\r\nappoint  a wider group of persons to sign conveyancing documents\r\n\r\non  its  behalf.  This is in clause 2.  It also streamlines  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  for the appointment of HDB's Chief Financial  Officer\r\n\r\nas  this  post is similar to HDB's other Heads of Department  in\r\n\r\nthat all are responsible to the Chief Executive Officer, who  in\r\n\r\nturn  is responsible to the Board.  Furthermore, the Bill allows\r\n\r\nHDB,  with the approval of the Minister, to enter into and carry\r\n\r\nout  agency agreements that do not relate to housing or building\r\n\r\nancillary services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development (Amendment) Bill.  However, I  do  have\r\n\r\nsome concerns on two of the three main proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amendment Bill introduces a new provision in the Act\r\n\r\nto empower the HDB to raise loans inside and outside\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  through the creation and issue of bonds or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister how this provision, which gives\r\n\r\nthe  HDB added flexibility to raise funds, would translate  into\r\n\r\nbetter  pricing  of HDB flats for Singaporeans.  Does  borrowing\r\n\r\nfrom  the  market  mean higher costs versus borrowing  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Currently, how does the Government charge for funds\r\n\r\nextended  to  the  HDB  for its housing programmes?   Since  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government has very large reserves, does it  not  make\r\n\r\nsense  to  borrow  from  the  market only  when  the  Government\r\n\r\nreserves  are  in fact earning more than the cost  of  borrowing\r\n\r\nfrom the market?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, are these bonds targetted at institutional or\r\n\r\nretail investors?  For the issue of bonds in Singapore, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to urge the HDB to consider issuing these bonds in smaller\r\n\r\ndenominations  of,  say, even $10,000, so that  the  Singaporean\r\n\r\nretail  investor can also participate in these bond instruments.\r\n\r\nThis  would give the man-in-the-street another avenue to  invest\r\n\r\nhis  surplus funds which, I believe, will give a slightly higher\r\n\r\nyield than fixed deposits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the HDB, together with the MAS, should help to create\r\n\r\na  more  liquid secondary market for these bonds for the benefit\r\n\r\nof retail investors.  The HDB should also apply to the CPF Board\r\n\r\nto  allow  the  use  of  CPF funds for such  investments.   Such\r\n\r\ninstruments  give  a fixed income at much lower  risk  than  the\r\n\r\nequities market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 65J of the Act confers on the HDB\r\n\r\nthe  power  to compulsorily acquire the whole of any  particular\r\n\r\nflat in the precinct for the purpose of those upgrading works to\r\n\r\nbe  carried out in that precinct.  I am very concerned about how\r\n\r\nthis  provision will affect certain individual owners  who  have\r\n\r\nlived  in  the precinct for many, many years.  One  could  argue\r\n\r\nthat he would be giving up his flat to benefit the majority, who\r\n\r\nmight be given a kindergarten or an old folks' corner to utilise\r\n\r\nand  enjoy.   However, this provision should be used very,  very\r\n\r\njudiciously,  and  perhaps only with the support  of  the  local\r\n\r\nMember of Parliament.  We should balance the right of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  individual to continue living in the precinct that  he  has\r\n\r\nchosen  many  years ago, with the public good and interest.   In\r\n\r\nthe case of the acquisition of homes for roads or MRT lines, for\r\n\r\nexample,  it  is more obvious that many thousands  will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  the acquisition. In the case of acquisition of a flat  for\r\n\r\nsome  communal  facility,  the number  of  neighbours  who  will\r\n\r\nbenefit is much smaller and, in my view, less justifiable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such an acquisition is deemed absolutely necessary for\r\n\r\nwhatever reason, I feel that the compensation should not  be  at\r\n\r\nthe  last transacted price of a similar flat in the precinct  or\r\n\r\nblock, or even the average of the last few transactions, but  at\r\n\r\na  significant premium above the market.  This will make the HDB\r\n\r\nthink  very carefully before acquiring.  It will also compensate\r\n\r\nthe  affected  owner who has to move away from the neighbourhood\r\n\r\nhe has grown accustomed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these two comments, I have no other comments on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill,  in particular the provisions enabling HDB to issue  bonds\r\n\r\nas  this  would  have the added benefit of contributing  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of our capital markets.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\nseek  clarification on the amendment set out in clause 7 of  the\r\n\r\nBill  in  relation  to the compulsory acquisition  of  flats  in\r\n\r\nupgrading projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB upgrading programmes have, in general, met with good\r\n\r\npublic response since its introduction.  Many owners of upgraded\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  testify to the greater enjoyment of  their  improved\r\n\r\nhomes and surrounding environment as well as the appreciation in\r\n\r\nthe  values  of  their  flats.  This is despite  the  fact  that\r\n\r\ninconvenience  and disruption may be caused  to  carry  out  the\r\n\r\nupgrading works.  For example, it is sometimes necessary to gain\r\n\r\naccess into individual flats in order to carry out the works  on\r\n\r\nother  parts  of  the  building.  In such cases,  the  Board  is\r\n\r\npresently  empowered under section 65J of the principal  Act  to\r\n\r\nauthorise  entry into any flat for the purpose of  carrying  out\r\n\r\nsuch works.  Under the proposed amendment to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection  65J,  the  Board  is to be given  a  further  power  to\r\n\r\ncompulsorily acquire HDB flats for upgrading works to be carried\r\n\r\nout  in  an  approved project.  In view of the broad wording  of\r\n\r\nthis  section, could the Minister give assurance  to  the  House\r\n\r\nthat  this  power  of acquisition will not be exercised  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  for  situations other than those which he  had  mentioned\r\n\r\njust now?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One fear I have is that for practical reasons, the\r\n\r\ncontractor may wish to have access to a particular flat to carry\r\n\r\nout upgrading works to other parts of the building and therefore\r\n\r\nit  may  be expeditious for the contractor to lobby the  HDB  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the flat for him to carry out the works in other  parts\r\n\r\nof  the  building.  Could the Minister assure us that this  will\r\n\r\nnot  be  the  case and that the power of compulsory  acquisition\r\n\r\nwill not be exercised in such situations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the flat unit is needed to become part of some\r\n\r\ncommunal facilities under the upgrading plan, the flat,  as  the\r\n\r\nMinister has pointed out, would be acquired by the HDB  for  the\r\n\r\nuse  of  the  flat to be changed. The main concern of  the  flat\r\n\r\nowner  would  then be the amount of compensation which  he  will\r\n\r\nreceive.   In this regard, could the Minister clarify the  basis\r\n\r\nupon  which  HDB  will determine the compensation  to  be  paid?\r\n\r\nWould  the quantum of compensation be based on valuation of  the\r\n\r\nunit as an HDB flat as provided by qualified HDB valuers, or its\r\n\r\nvalue as part of a kindergarten or senior citizen's corner,  for\r\n\r\nexample?  Further, the new  subsection 9 provides that the owner\r\n\r\nmay  object to the compensation offered by the Board by  stating\r\n\r\nhis grounds in writing.  I have some queries in relation to this\r\n\r\nissue.  What are the grounds of objection which can  be  validly\r\n\r\nraised  by  the  owner?  Is it a valid ground  that  the  market\r\n\r\nvaluation  obtained from qualified HDB valuers  is  higher  than\r\n\r\nthose offered by the HDB?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have raised the above issues in relation to the\r\n\r\ncompulsory  acquisition  of flats because  I  feel  that  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  for  the  public to know when and  how  they  may  be\r\n\r\naffected  by  this power to be given to the HDB to  acquire  the\r\n\r\nflat.  While the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactual  number of flat owners who will be affected is likely  to\r\n\r\nbe  very  small, I believe these issues should be  clarified  to\r\n\r\nprevent any misconceptions which may affect the support given by\r\n\r\nHDB  flat owners for upgrading projects in their precinct.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  as  the  Minister has clarified just now,  whether  to\r\n\r\nproceed  with the upgrading works will be left to the  residents\r\n\r\nand  they  have  to  obtain more than 75% of the  votes  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  before  they can carry out the  upgrading  programme.\r\n\r\nBut to the aggrieved flat owner whose unit is to be acquired  by\r\n\r\nthe  HDB, it is no comfort to him to think that the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  residents  of the estate would of course want  the  HDB  to\r\n\r\nacquire his flat for some communal facilities which will  be  of\r\n\r\nbenefit to the majority of the residents.  After all, the  money\r\n\r\nfor the compensation will be paid by the HDB, and not out of the\r\n\r\nupgrading  project budget, or out of pockets of the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am surprised to note that the HDB\r\n\r\nneeds  to issue bonds as an alternative source of funding.   The\r\n\r\ntraditional way of HDB funds is from the Government.  They get a\r\n\r\nloan from the Government and they pay an interest.  This loan is\r\n\r\nused  to  build  HDB  flats and in turn the flats  are  sold  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public.  Once the profits are  taken  in,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is repaid their loans.  I am just curious why at this\r\n\r\nstage  funds  have to be raised from outside Singapore  or  from\r\n\r\nother  sources  other than Government funds.   My  question  is:\r\n\r\nHave  the Government funds in fact been dried up that there  are\r\n\r\nno  Government  funds now to finance HDB  projects?   Or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  of the bad economic times that funds are short  because\r\n\r\nthe  Government has to help out in many areas?   We  have  noted\r\n\r\nthat  even  the upgrading programme of the HDB has to be  slowed\r\n\r\ndown.  So my curiosity is aroused.  Why is there a need to raise\r\n\r\nmoney other than from the traditional source?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area that I would like to comment is this new\r\n\r\ndraconian  clause 7(b) whereby the HDB is given  new  powers  of\r\n\r\nacquisition.  My fear is that once\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompulsory  acquisition powers are given  to  the  HDB,  we  are\r\n\r\nopening the Pandora's box.  Now the HDB can tell members of  the\r\n\r\npublic  that they are acquiring only a flat on the ground  floor\r\n\r\nand making more provisions for the other flat dwellers.  But who\r\n\r\nknows,  in  time to come, this power can be used very  liberally\r\n\r\nbecause in new subsections 7 to 14, which give power to the  HDB\r\n\r\nto  compulsorily acquire a flat, nowhere does it say that  these\r\n\r\npowers  cannot be extended. This is the fear of the public  that\r\n\r\nonce these powers are given, we are opening the Pandora's box.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the HDB has renovated and upgraded hundreds of\r\n\r\nflats.  Why was there no need to have this power of acquisition?\r\n\r\nWhy  is  there a necessity now to compulsorily acquire  a  flat?\r\n\r\nAre  there that many cases that the Minister has mentioned,  ie,\r\n\r\nthese  flats that are in the void decks?  As far as  I  know,  I\r\n\r\nhave  not come across any of such flats.  Can the Minister  name\r\n\r\nwhere these flats are situated in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the occasions when a flat is needed for the\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  a  block?  Can this flat be also  compulsorily\r\n\r\nacquired  if the upgrading cannot be proceeded with unless  that\r\n\r\nflat is acquired?  I would imagine that, if that is the case, it\r\n\r\nwould  be a more compelling and cogent reason, and not  just  to\r\n\r\nacquire a flat for the benefit of the other flat dwellers.  This\r\n\r\nexercise of compulsory acquisition must be rarely used.  Can the\r\n\r\nMinister assure us that all possible remedies or solutions would\r\n\r\nbe sought first before a flat is to be acquired?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in regard to the procedure of appeal, the appeal is only to\r\n\r\na  Minister,  and  one  would imagine  that  a  Minister  is  an\r\n\r\ninterested party, if not in that flat, at least in that block or\r\n\r\nin that project.  Appeal must normally be made to an independent\r\n\r\nbody,  rather than to a person who has interest in the  project.\r\n\r\nSo  I  would suggest that the final appeal must be to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt, even after having gone through the Minister.  I think  it\r\n\r\nis  fair  because a person's home is being taken away from  him.\r\n\r\nThe final appeal must be to a higher authority which has got  no\r\n\r\ninterest whatsoever on the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the payment of compensation, again the section\r\n\r\nseems  to  be rather unsatisfactory.  Because it does not  spell\r\n\r\nout  how  compensation is to be paid, what  amount  and  if  the\r\n\r\namount  is to be given, at what date that amount will be  taken.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Act on compulsory acquisition of land, there is a cut-off date.  So the amount is fixed, say, on 1st January 1975,  or\r\n\r\n1995, or whatever date is given.  But in this case, there is  no\r\n\r\ncut-off  date.   So  in times of plenty, the  HDB  may  be  very\r\n\r\ngenerous  but  in hard times like these, the flat owner  may  be\r\n\r\ngiven  a  small  amount.  And if that happens,  he  will  suffer\r\n\r\ntwice.   Firstly,  his flat will be acquired and,  secondly,  he\r\n\r\nwill  be paid a derisory amount.  I hope the Minister would have\r\n\r\na second look at this particular clause.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this\r\n\r\nopportunity to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am in support of the Bill. But there are certain\r\n\r\nprovisions which I have my reservation.  I support the  move  to\r\n\r\nprotect  only  the  citizens.  Only  citizens  should  have  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of the Bankruptcy Act.  I think this piece of amendment\r\n\r\nshould have been introduced long ago.  I suppose initially  only\r\n\r\ncitizens could buy a property, but subsequently there were  some\r\n\r\namendments allowing PRs to purchase it.  I think there should be\r\n\r\na  distinction between citizens and non-citizens, and I  support\r\n\r\nthe Minister that it is a right move at the right time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the new section 49A. It would have a\r\n\r\nstandard  form of contract.  This will allow for certainty.   It\r\n\r\nwould also save the purchaser, instead of going to lawyers,  and\r\n\r\nhe  would  know what he is expected to meet.  I only  hope  when\r\n\r\nthis  standard  form  of  agreement is  drawn  up,  it  will  be\r\n\r\nfavourable to both the purchaser and the seller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I must raise my objection to new section 65J, and Mr\r\n\r\nChiam has mentioned it earlier.  I have no objection at all that\r\n\r\nthe  Government acquires a property for the common good  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  the country.  I think we have to upgrade  and  I\r\n\r\nmust compliment the Minister and his Ministry for having\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndone  such  a  good job.  Those areas which I have  visited  and\r\n\r\nwhich  have  been  upgraded  have  really  benefited  from  this\r\n\r\nupgrading  scheme.   But  clauses 8,  9  and  10  are  not  very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.   I will go further than what the earlier  Members\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned.  HDB is going to acquire a property and  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  judged in its own course.  Every law student  and\r\n\r\nlawyer  will  tell  you that you cannot be judged  in  your  own\r\n\r\ncourse.  Here the Board is going to acquire a property and  tell\r\n\r\nyou how much it is going to be, and that is not fair.  I think a\r\n\r\nfairer  solution would be to have an independent panel and  that\r\n\r\npanel can decide what is a fair compensation.  Because not  only\r\n\r\nyou must not be judged in your own course, there is also another\r\n\r\nprinciple of law that justice must not only be done but seen  to\r\n\r\nbe done.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the HDB will act  bona\r\n\r\nfide.   But  the  public, the majority of  Singaporeans  in  HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  must be assured that the compensation they are going  to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  is  a fair compensation.  And I share the view  of  my\r\n\r\nlearned  friend, Mr Chiam, to have an independent panel.   There\r\n\r\nis   already  an  existing  provision  for  a  Land  Acquisition\r\n\r\nTribunal.  Or you may set up another tribunal.  So for a  member\r\n\r\nof the public, I think there would be very unhappy circumstances\r\n\r\nto  have  a clause where you raise an objection and the Minister\r\n\r\nconsiders  and  gives  his decisions,  and  it  is  final.   The\r\n\r\nMinister  cannot be judged in his own course.  And in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the right of the HDB flat owners, the Minister  may\r\n\r\nwant to consider some other solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be a bit too late at this stage to have the Bill\r\n\r\namended but, nevertheless, I would urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nthe  position of setting up some panels or at least there should\r\n\r\nbe mechanism in the HDB itself where members of the public could\r\n\r\nsit  in this panel and they could see that a fair hearing and  a\r\n\r\nfair  consideration  are  given to the property  that  is  being\r\n\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these reservations, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I share the concern of the speakers before\r\n\r\nme as regards the powers of acquisition.  Clearly, there are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions   under   the  existing  laws  for   either   general\r\n\r\nacquisition  of  land  or  the Selective  En-bloc  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nScheme.   I  am  not  sure that we need to add another  specific\r\n\r\npower to the various powers that already exist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly concerned, Sir, that the criteria for the\r\n\r\nexercise  of powers are not made clear in the statute.   In  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement,  the reasons he gave  us  were  perfectly\r\n\r\nreasonable but not being in the statute, we cannot be sure  that\r\n\r\nthis  will  always  be  so.   I would suggest,  therefore,  that\r\n\r\nsubsidiary  legislation or regulations should be promulgated  to\r\n\r\nset  out  the criteria.  These criteria would serve not just  to\r\n\r\nreassure  people  but  would also therefore  serve  as  relevant\r\n\r\ncriteria  to take the objections, from the owners, that  is,  if\r\n\r\nthey should object.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, Sir, I would suggest that another mechanism that\r\n\r\nmay be of use to the Minister in exercise of these powers is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  by policy that before any acquisition is made  pursuant\r\n\r\nto  this power, a public social impact statement should be made:\r\n\r\nthat  is  to  say,  in any particular case, the  situation,  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  plan  should  be  studied  thoroughly  and  a  public\r\n\r\ndocument  issued stating how many blocks are affected, for  what\r\n\r\npurpose, and this would give a much better ground for people  to\r\n\r\nmake the decision that would vote yes or no for the upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister offers us a 75% voting ratio for upgrading as\r\n\r\na safeguard.  This is usually sufficient.  But in the event that\r\n\r\nthose  affected would be less than 25%, the 75% could be  easily\r\n\r\nobtained  by  those  who  benefit even if  all  those  who  were\r\n\r\naffected  would  say  no.   In this regard,  I  think  the  best\r\n\r\nsafeguard  would be to require a double majority; that  is,  the\r\n\r\nexisting  75%  of  all occupants to agree  to  upgrading  and  a\r\n\r\ncertain  percentage  of those affected.  Some  might  say  those\r\n\r\naffected  will, of course, not agree, but as the Minister  says,\r\n\r\nif  the  compensation  is fair and attractive,  then  perhaps  a\r\n\r\ncertain  percentage would.  This percentage could be lower  than\r\n\r\n75% of course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compensation quantum needs also to be thought through\r\n\r\nmore  carefully.  I think that, given the context of  upgrading,\r\n\r\nthe first question must be whether this compensation would be on\r\n\r\npre-upgrading criteria or post-upgrading criteria.   After  all,\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of the upgrading is to increase the value  of  the\r\n\r\nassets.   Those stripped of an asset before upgrading will  then\r\n\r\nbe  double  losers - they lose the asset as it is and they  lose\r\n\r\nthe  chance to upgrade the asset.  And surely, Sir, that  cannot\r\n\r\nbe a point of upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few months ago, we looked at a very similar law as\r\n\r\nregards  the  Land  Titles  (Strata)  (Amendment)  Bill.    Very\r\n\r\nbriefly,  one of the key differences between that provision  and\r\n\r\nthis  is  of  a  reference  to a third party  for  mediation  or\r\n\r\notherwise  to  try to settle the matter.  I would encourage  the\r\n\r\nMinistry to think of including such third-party measures, if not\r\n\r\nas law, then, again, as a matter of policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> First of all, let me thank Members for\r\n\r\nraising  the various points.  Let me just address the  point  on\r\n\r\nissuing  of  bonds.   Let me assure Members that  this  idea  of\r\n\r\nissuing bonds is not because Government funds have dried up.  We\r\n\r\nwanted  to  raise bonds because it makes for a better  and  more\r\n\r\nefficient   way   of  raising  capital.   Today,   all   housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment bonds are raised from the Government as well as from\r\n\r\nthe  banks, including POSB.  This is not the most efficient  way\r\n\r\nbecause HDB's development projects are long term in nature and a\r\n\r\nbetter  matching of our requirements versus our source of  funds\r\n\r\ncan  be  achieved by having a mixture of bonds  and  loans.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  will try to raise the bonds at a period  where  the\r\n\r\ncost of funds will be most advantageous to us.  This will depend\r\n\r\non the rating of HDB by external agencies and also on the market\r\n\r\nconditions at the time that we raised bonds.  So, we will try to\r\n\r\ndo so at a time most advantageous to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the purpose of raising the bonds is to provide the\r\n\r\ncapital  market  in Singapore with breadth and  depth.   As  you\r\n\r\nknow, we are trying to develop Singapore as a debt centre and we\r\n\r\nare trying to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide   more  sources  for  both  institutional   and   retail\r\n\r\ninvestors,  a  range of bond issues with different  tenures  and\r\n\r\ndifferent  risk ratings.  To develop this market,  we  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  we  should provide liquidity and ensure that the secondary\r\n\r\nmarket  is liquid.  And I am sure MAS will take up with CPF  the\r\n\r\nissue  of  allowing  CPF  funds for  investing  in  such  bonds,\r\n\r\nincluding the HDB bonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, let me turn to the issue of acquisition. Perhaps I used\r\n\r\ntoo  much shorthand in explaining how we are going to go through\r\n\r\nit.   Let  me  explain in greater detail.  When I use  shorthand\r\n\r\nlike  SERS  and  all that, I thought it would be easy  for  most\r\n\r\npeople to follow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the problem and how we are tackling it. As you\r\n\r\nknow,  in  many of our old estates, we have flats  on  the  void\r\n\r\ndeck, on the ground floor.  So when we do the upgrading, we  are\r\n\r\nobligated  to  also upgrade the units on the ground  floor.   In\r\n\r\nsome  of these estates, the open space is very limited.   So  we\r\n\r\nfind  we cannot provide communal space for the units.  In  areas\r\n\r\nwhere  we  can provide communal space, there is no intention  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the ground floor flats in order to create the  communal\r\n\r\nfacilities.   A good example will be Kim Keat - the first  pilot\r\n\r\nproject.  There was plenty of space, so you can provide communal\r\n\r\nspace  in open space without having to disrupt the ground  floor\r\n\r\nunits.  In the case of Mountbatten in Old Airport Road, we found\r\n\r\nthe  space to be very tight.  There was not enough space for  us\r\n\r\nto  provide communal facilities.  And the way we went  about  it\r\n\r\nwas  to  persuade the ground floor units to give  up  the  flats\r\n\r\nindividually, everyone of them.  Fortunately, we  were  able  to\r\n\r\npersuade them and they all gave up their units and as a  result,\r\n\r\nwe  were  able  to  come out with a very good upgrading  package\r\n\r\nwhich  benefited everybody - the majority as well as the  owners\r\n\r\non the ground floor units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we are introducing this amendment to address such situations\r\n\r\nwhere  the ground floor units are occupied, where the  space  is\r\n\r\nvery  tight  and we have no choice but to acquire the  units  in\r\n\r\norder  to  provide communal space.  Let me assure  Members  that\r\n\r\nthere are enough checks and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbalances.  The  Minister  is not an  interested  party  in  this\r\n\r\nexercise. In fact, the whole exercise is under the charge of the\r\n\r\nadvisor  who is the Chairman of the Working Committee which  has\r\n\r\nto  work  out the upgrading package. The advisor has to sell  to\r\n\r\nhis residents, including the residents on the ground floor, that\r\n\r\nthere  is  not  enough space and therefore  acquisition  of  the\r\n\r\nground  floor  units is part of the package.   The  compensation\r\n\r\ngoes  to HDB budget for that precinct. So, there are checks  and\r\n\r\nbalances. The advisor cannot go round acquiring all the units he\r\n\r\nwants  because he is going to bust his upgrading  project.   So,\r\n\r\nthe Minister is not an interested party.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the advisor has managed to sell his upgrading package to\r\n\r\nhis  residents, and they have taken a vote (75% say  yes),  they\r\n\r\nwill send the plan to the Ministry and if we think that it is  a\r\n\r\nsensible plan, the Minister would sanction the acquisition.  And\r\n\r\nfor  the  flats to be acquired, we are providing them  the  same\r\n\r\nSERS  package. When I say SERS package, it means,  firstly,  the\r\n\r\ncompensation  is  under the Land Acquisition Act  with  all  its\r\n\r\nchannels for appeal. It is done by an independent valuer on  the\r\n\r\ndate  of  1st  January  1995.  We pay them an  ex-gratia  market\r\n\r\nsupplement  to bring the compensation value of 1st January  1995\r\n\r\nto  the  present  value, as at the date of the announcement.  We\r\n\r\noffer  the  lessee  whose flat is acquired a  new  flat  in  the\r\n\r\nvicinity with 20% discount in the new flat.  If he cannot afford\r\n\r\na  new  flat,  we offer him a three-room buy-back  flat.  If  he\r\n\r\ncannot  afford a three-room buy-back flat, we offer him a rental\r\n\r\nflat.   Under  the SERS package, the compensation  is  extremely\r\n\r\nfair  and  we  do not anticipate many problems from  the  people\r\n\r\nwhose flats are acquired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarise:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) this will be done extremely selectively;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the compensation package is undertaken through the SERS\r\n\r\nmodel which is fairly well tried out and with enough avenues  of\r\n\r\nappeal; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) the advisor has to initiate and sanction the upgrading and\r\n\r\nmake  sure that this is for the benefit of the majority  in  his\r\n\r\nprecinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  can assure Members that there are enough safeguards and  this\r\n\r\nwill not be done except very, very selectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole issue about the criteria for exercising power or the\r\n\r\nsocial  impact  are all covered by the advisor  in  his  Working\r\n\r\nCommittee.  He has to deal with the Residents Committee  members\r\n\r\nand  residents.   In the Main Upgrading Programme,  the  process\r\n\r\ntakes  several  iterations.   It goes  back  and  forth  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents several times before they actually take a vote on  the\r\n\r\npackage.  Let me assure Members that these powers will  be  used\r\n\r\njudiciously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to add to the comments about the Bankruptcy Act. It is true\r\n\r\nthat  was  covered when HDB flats were all bought  by  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.  When we liberalised and allowed PRs to buy  in  1989,\r\n\r\nwe  could   have removed that protection then, rather than  now.\r\n\r\nThe  standard sales and purchase agreement will be fair to  both\r\n\r\nbuyer  and  purchaser.  It is the sales and  purchase  agreement\r\n\r\nthat  we are using today in all resale purchases.  It is working\r\n\r\nwell. We just want to provide the legislative basis to make sure\r\n\r\nthat  everybody  uses the same document.   We  have  had  estate\r\n\r\nagents  who  provide  supplements  to  the  standard  sales  and\r\n\r\npurchase agreement and try to bypass the provisions. So, this is\r\n\r\nto prevent such abuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Other than Mountbatten, what other estates\r\n\r\nhave flats on the ground floor?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When you walk around Redhill, Queensway and\r\n\r\nQueenstown, many of the flats were built before HDB undertook to\r\n\r\nbuild  the  satellite  towns in a very  comprehensive  way.   We\r\n\r\nprovided flats on the ground floor. Maybe he should walk around,\r\n\r\nbesides Potong Pasir, or his party should do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But these were all built in as part of the\r\n\r\nbuilding. They were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot in the original plan as void decks.  Am I correct?  They are\r\n\r\nalready  part  of the structure of the building.   You  want  to\r\n\r\nremove  them  to  make into void decks. That is  another  matter\r\n\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is the whole point. When we built these\r\n\r\nold buildings, we maximised the space and we built flats even on\r\n\r\nthe ground floor.  Later on, as we went into Toa Payoh, we tried\r\n\r\nout  this  concept of void decks. After 30 years of  experience,\r\n\r\nvoid  decks  do provide an added advantage to Singaporeans,  not\r\n\r\njust  in making the estate look more spacious, it provides space\r\n\r\nfor  communal  facilities, etc.  That is  why  void  decks  have\r\n\r\nbecome a standard feature in HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we upgrade the old estates, we could just upgrade all the\r\n\r\nunits as they stand, without improving the estate's ambience  by\r\n\r\ncreating  a  new  void deck.  In some of these old  estates,  if\r\n\r\nthere is space elsewhere to provide communal facilities, we  can\r\n\r\ndo  so  without disturbing the units on the ground floor, as  we\r\n\r\nhave done in Kim Keat and other areas.  In some of these housing\r\n\r\nestates,  it  is very tight and if you want to provide  communal\r\n\r\nfacilities to your senior citizens or kindergartens, there is no\r\n\r\nspace.   One  option is to remove the units on the ground  floor\r\n\r\nand   therefore  create  a  void  deck  so  that  you  get  more\r\n\r\nspaciousness  in  your  estate.  This means  you  will  have  to\r\n\r\ncompensate  the people who are presently living  on  the  ground\r\n\r\nfloor.  That is the whole purpose of the provision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The HDB says it is to give better ambience\r\n\r\nto  the residents there.  But do the residents themselves demand\r\n\r\nfor  it?   Are there complaints that there are no void  deck  in\r\n\r\ntheir block?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As I explained, that is entirely up to the\r\n\r\nadvisor  and  his  Working Committee. In the  precinct,  if  the\r\n\r\nresidents  are  happy  and do not want to  create  new  communal\r\n\r\nfacilities, the Minister is the last person who will want to  go\r\n\r\nand  disturb  them.  It is entirely up to the  advisor  and  his\r\n\r\nWorking Committee. We are the last person to want to acquire the\r\n\r\nflats  but if the majority of the residents feel that they  want\r\n\r\nto upgrade and provide\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore communal facilities and, in so doing, they need to remove\r\n\r\nthe units on the ground floor, we are prepared to offer them\r\n\r\nSERS compensation, which is very attractive.  And I can assure\r\n\r\nyou  that the reason why we are able to persuade everyone of\r\n\r\nthose in Mountbatten to give up their flats voluntarily is\r\n\r\nbecause the compensation is very attractive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee\r\n\r\nof the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the\r\n\r\nBill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee, reported without amendment, read a\r\n\r\nThird time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Overview</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House principally focuses on the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of the law to allow companies to  conduct  share\r\n\r\nbuy-backs. Apart from this major amendment, opportunity is  also\r\n\r\ntaken  to  incorporate seven other amendments. These  amendments\r\n\r\nseek to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) update the concept of \"deemed interest\" under section\r\n\r\n7(4);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) extend the lifespan of employee stock options under\r\n\r\nsection 77 from the current 5 years to 10 years;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) exclude trade franchises from the ambit of the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) empower the Minister to make regulations to regulate\r\n\r\nthe  administration of unit trusts by managers and trustees, and\r\n\r\nto extend the life of unit trust prospectuses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) remove all restrictions relating to substantial\r\n\r\nproperty transactions under sections 160A to 160D;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) allow a company to purchase insurance for any officer\r\n\r\nof the company\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst liability on negligence or breach of duty to the company\r\n\r\nnot occasioned by any wilful act or default on his part; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) exempt foreign companies from being required to be\r\n\r\nregistered in Singapore in certain instances.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Share buy-backs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first deal with the amendment relating to share buy-backs. The Bill proposes to allow for the purchase or\r\n\r\nacquisition  by a company of its own shares out of distributable\r\n\r\nprofits,   after   obtaining   the   necessary   mandates   from\r\n\r\nshareholders.  It presents a direct and more efficient means  of\r\n\r\nreturning  cash  to  shareholders, than  the  capital  reduction\r\n\r\nprocedure  that  is currently provided under the Companies  Act.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  a capital reduction exercise may  take  at  least\r\n\r\nthree  months to complete and also requires confirmation by  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court.  In  contrast, a share buy-back affords  a  company\r\n\r\ngreater  flexibility  in  the timing, procedure  and  amount  of\r\n\r\ncapital  to be returned to shareholders.  It thus increases  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  ability  to adjust its capital base  and  debt-equity\r\n\r\nratio  and  can  improve a company's return on capital,  to  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of shareholders.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.42 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of these advantages, the Government earlier made an\r\n\r\nannouncement, in response to the recommendation by  the  Finance\r\n\r\nand  Banking  Subcommittee, that companies will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nrepurchase  their shares, subject to safeguards.  Various  forms\r\n\r\nof  share  buy-back schemes are already allowed  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates,  the  United  Kingdom,  Hong  Kong,  Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand.   Government  agencies have studied  these  alternative\r\n\r\nmodels  and  have  worked  closely with  the  Corporate  Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee,  the Stock Exchange of Singapore, the Association  of\r\n\r\nBanks in Singapore, the Law Society and other interested parties\r\n\r\nto  develop  the  proposal  in the  Bill  before  you.  In  this\r\n\r\nproposal,  both  listed  and  unlisted  companies,  public   and\r\n\r\nprivate,  can  conduct share buy-backs. Now I will briefly  walk\r\n\r\nthe House through the provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill seek to amend sections 73 and\r\n\r\n76  to allow for the purchase or acquisition by a company of its\r\n\r\nown  shares, without having to make an application to  the  High\r\n\r\nCourt  for  approval.   Clause  5 of  the  Bill  introduces  new\r\n\r\nsections  76B  to  76G.  These sections set out the  appropriate\r\n\r\nsafeguards and disclosure requirements that have been formulated\r\n\r\nto ensure that companies will not abuse the scheme of share buy-backs to the detriment of their creditors.  These safeguards are\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Companies will only be able to buy back their ordinary\r\n\r\nshares if their Articles of Association allow for it;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) All companies must obtain their shareholders'\r\n\r\napproval by ordinary resolution to buy back their own shares via\r\n\r\nan  off-market  acquisition on an \"equal access\"  scheme.   This\r\n\r\nessentially  means a pro-rata buy back offer.  Listed  companies\r\n\r\nmust  also obtain a similar approval in order to carry  out  on-market share buy backs;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Listed companies will not be allowed to conduct\r\n\r\nselective   off-market  purchases.   Unlisted   companies   may,\r\n\r\nhowever,   obtain  their  shareholders'  approval   by   special\r\n\r\nresolution  to  conduct  selective  off-market  buy  backs,  but\r\n\r\ninterested parties will not be able to vote in favour of such  a\r\n\r\nresolution;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Companies must buy back their shares out of\r\n\r\ndistributable profits only;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Companies will be permitted to buy back shares up to a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  10%  of their issued ordinary share capital  during\r\n\r\neach  relevant  period.  The capital base to which  the  10%  is\r\n\r\npegged  is  to  be  ascertained at the date of the  last  annual\r\n\r\ngeneral  meeting or at the date of the resolution, whichever  is\r\n\r\nhigher,  unless  the Court through an order  had  confirmed  the\r\n\r\nreduction  of  share capital.  In the latter  case,  the  issued\r\n\r\nordinary  share capital of the company would be  the  amount  as\r\n\r\naltered by the Court order during the relevant period;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) There is also the introduction of an insolvency test.\r\n\r\nThe  company's directors may be personally liable as  it  is  an\r\n\r\noffence  for a director to approve a share buy back when  he  is\r\n\r\naware that the company is insolvent or will become insolvent  as\r\n\r\na result of the buy back;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) All repurchased shares must be cancelled; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Companies must set up a capital redemption reserve\r\n\r\naccount.   The amount by which a company's issued share  capital\r\n\r\nis  diminished  by  share buy backs must be transferred  to  its\r\n\r\ncapital redemption reserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional safeguards for public listed companies will be\r\n\r\nformulated  by the Stock Exchange of Singapore as  part  of  its\r\n\r\nlisting rules, and will be announced shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now go through the other amendments in the Bill.\r\n\r\nThese  amendments are designed to improve market efficiency  and\r\n\r\nliberalise  regulations  to afford companies  more  flexibility.\r\n\r\nThey  also  seek to rationalise the provisions in the  Companies\r\n\r\nAct with existing practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concept of \"deemed interest\"</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the definition of\r\n\r\n\"deemed interest\" in the shares of a company in section 7(4)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Act,  to increase the threshold interest from 15%  to  20%.\r\n\r\nThis  will  bring  the  concept  of  \"deemed  interest\"  in  the\r\n\r\nCompanies   Act  in  line  with  the  threshold  of  significant\r\n\r\ninfluence   in  an  associated  company  under  the   accounting\r\n\r\nconvention and the Singapore Code on Take-Overs and Mergers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current concept of \"deemed interest\" under section 7(4)\r\n\r\nis also capable of successive applications ad infinitum along  a\r\n\r\nchain  of  companies.   This  has  given  rise  to  considerable\r\n\r\nconfusion  and practical difficulty.  Clause 2 therefore  amends\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  restrict section 7(4) from applying to  successive\r\n\r\nlevels.   The  application of the \"deemed interest\"  concept  is\r\n\r\nrestricted to one level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Lifespan of Employee Stock Options</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the law restricts all stock options, including\r\n\r\nthose  given  to  employees to take  up  unissued  shares  in  a\r\n\r\ncompany, to a lifespan of 5 years.  Employee stock options are a\r\n\r\npowerful  tool to reward employees, and the lifespan  should  be\r\n\r\nextended to help retain and motivate employees.  Clause 6 amends\r\n\r\nthe  Act to provide that the maximum lifespan of employee  stock\r\n\r\noptions  be extended from 5 years to 10 years.  The lifespan  of\r\n\r\nother forms of options remains at 5 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Trade Franchises</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next amendment under clause 7 seeks to amend the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"interest\" in section 107 of the Act  to  exclude\r\n\r\ntrade franchises.  This will clarify that franchises offered  to\r\n\r\nthe  public  are not subject to the onerous trust  arrangements,\r\n\r\nand  trust  deed and prospectus requirements of the Act.   These\r\n\r\nprovisions will enable the promotion of franchises on  a  larger\r\n\r\nscale,  as  a  strategy  for  small  retailers  to  upgrade  and\r\n\r\nmodernise  their business.  Only franchises as defined  will  be\r\n\r\nexcluded  from the definition.  Unit trust and other  collective\r\n\r\ninvestment  schemes  will continue to  be  regulated  under  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Unit Trust Legislation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit trusts are currently regulated under the Companies Act\r\n\r\nas  they are a form of \"interest\" as defined under section  107.\r\n\r\nThe  provisions in section 111 and regulation 9 of the Companies\r\n\r\nRegulations apply across the board to all forms of interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively regulate the different forms of\r\n\r\ninterest  under  section  107, in particular  unit  trusts,  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance needs to be empowered to be able  to  make\r\n\r\nspecific regulations concerning each class of interest,  as  and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  need arises.  Clauses 8 to10 of the Bill  enable  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, clauses 10 and 14 of the Bill also seek to\r\n\r\nextend the life of unit trust\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprospectuses from the current duration of 6 months to 12 months.\r\n\r\nThere  is no increased risk of inaccurate prospectuses being  in\r\n\r\ncirculation,  following  the extension  to  12  months,  as  the\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  trustees are under legal obligation  to  re-lodge\r\n\r\ntheir prospectuses whenever material changes take place and  are\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Substantial Property Transactions</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill seeks to repeal sections 160A and\r\n\r\n160D  of  the  Act, thus removing the restrictions  relating  to\r\n\r\nsubstantial property transactions.  The provisions have  created\r\n\r\npractical  difficulties  and  are  somewhat  redundant,  as  all\r\n\r\nrelated-party  transactions  of  listed  companies  are  already\r\n\r\nsubject  to  disclosure or shareholders' approval (depending  on\r\n\r\nthe amount) under the Stock Exchange of Singapore rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Provisions indemnifying Directors or Officers of a Company</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, it has not been clear from a reading of section\r\n\r\n172  whether  a  company can pay the premiums for  a  director's\r\n\r\nindemnity policy.  However, it is now standard practice in  many\r\n\r\njurisdictions  for  companies to take  up  insurance  for  their\r\n\r\ndirectors  and  pay the premium.  The amendment makes  it  clear\r\n\r\nthat  a  company may purchase insurance for any officer  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany  against liability for negligence or breach of  duty  to\r\n\r\nthe  company,  which are not occasioned by  any  wilful  act  or\r\n\r\ndefault  on  his  part.  The United Kingdom and  Australia  have\r\n\r\nprovisions that have equivalent effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Registration of Foreign Companies</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 amends section 366 by seeking to exempt foreign\r\n\r\ncompanies  from  being registered in Singapore in  two  specific\r\n\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, global financial institutions transact in certain\r\n\r\nfinancial  instruments  booked into  a  single  office  of  that\r\n\r\nfinancial institution.  This \"global book\" will then be \"passed\"\r\n\r\nfrom  one  financial  centre  to  another  and  traded  by  that\r\n\r\nfinancial  institution's employees throughout the world.   Under\r\n\r\nthe current legal position, where\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntrading  takes place through the Singapore office, this  foreign\r\n\r\ninstitution  can  be  considered as \"carrying  on  business\"  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  hence  should be registered  as  well.   Such  a\r\n\r\nrequirement is unduly onerous, if the foreign parent already has\r\n\r\na  registered  presence  in  Singapore.   As  increasingly  more\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions adopt this practice, the gap between  the\r\n\r\nlaw and commercial practice needs to be closed to keep pace with\r\n\r\nother  jurisdictions  like Hong Kong, where  there  is  no  such\r\n\r\nregistration requirement.  With the amendment, foreign companies\r\n\r\nneed  not  register if they effect any transaction  through  its\r\n\r\nrelated  corporation licensed or approved under any written  law\r\n\r\nby  the  Monetary Authority of Singapore or under an arrangement\r\n\r\napproved by the MAS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second instance, clause 13 seeks to free foreign\r\n\r\nfinancial institutions from having to register if they establish\r\n\r\na  share transfer or share registration office in Singapore,  in\r\n\r\norder to become a listed corporation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These amendments to the Companies Act form the first group\r\n\r\nof  amendments proposed, as part of a wider exercise  to  update\r\n\r\nand modernise company legislation in the coming months.  Most of\r\n\r\nthe  proposed amendments are still being reviewed and will  only\r\n\r\nbe  introduced  next  year.  The review is part  of  an  ongoing\r\n\r\neffort by the Government to improve the business environment and\r\n\r\nput  in  place  a more flexible legislative framework  that  can\r\n\r\nrespond  quickly  to  opportunities when the  economy  picks  up\r\n\r\nagain.   I  believe that the amendments I have proposed  take  a\r\n\r\nstep  in  this  direction, and set the stage for a more  vibrant\r\n\r\neconomic and financial climate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this Bill.  I shall focus my comments  on  the\r\n\r\nmain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfeature of the Bill which is to allow the buy back of shares  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  companies.   This buy back arrangement  is  currently\r\n\r\nprohibited by the provisions of the Companies Act.  At  present,\r\n\r\ncompanies can use their financial resources to invest in or  buy\r\n\r\nshares  of  other  companies.   Such  investment  decisions  are\r\n\r\nusually  made  based  on  limited  information  of  the   target\r\n\r\ninvestments   of  companies.   In  some  cases,  the   companies\r\n\r\nthemselves  may  be  good  investments and  the  companies  know\r\n\r\nthemselves  best.  Hence, it may be worthwhile for companies  to\r\n\r\nbuy  back  their  own  shares rather than buy  shares  of  other\r\n\r\ncompanies.   This provision of allowing companies  to  buy  back\r\n\r\ntheir own shares is an enlightened approach.  It is permitted in\r\n\r\nmany  countries nowadays.  If companies can buy other companies'\r\n\r\nshares,  why  not allow them to buy back their own shares  which\r\n\r\nare  or  can  be better investments?  The share buy back  scheme\r\n\r\nwill also be in the  interest of the shareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I note the present Bill has a few restrictions on\r\n\r\nshare  buy  back.  First,  share buy back is only permitted  for\r\n\r\nordinary  shares and not allowed for preference shares or  other\r\n\r\nclasses  of  shares.   Second, a company  is  required  to  seek\r\n\r\nshareholders' approval where the following information has to be\r\n\r\ndisclosed:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the total number of shares which may be acquired is limited\r\n\r\nto 10%;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the maximum price to be paid for the shares; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the date by which the authority to purchase will expire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for some clarifications.\r\n\r\nFirst,  why  restrict the buy back of shares  only  to  ordinary\r\n\r\nshares  but not allow other classes of shares such as preference\r\n\r\nshares,  convertible shares or even warrants?   Would  this  not\r\n\r\ngive the companies more flexibility and choices?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister on the disclosure of\r\n\r\ncertain   information  such  as  the  limit  of  10%  of   total\r\n\r\nshareholding, the maximum price and the limitation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe date to buy the shares.  First, on the limitation of 10%\r\n\r\ntotal shareholding.  Companies may want to buy more shares when\r\n\r\nthey want to go out and buy their own shares.   So, would it not\r\n\r\nbe beneficial for companies to be able to buy more than 10%?\r\n\r\nThere may be sellers who want to sell more than 10% each time?\r\n\r\nSo why not have a higher limit?  Perhaps 15%, 25% or even 50% of\r\n\r\ntheir own shares to buy back.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the disclosure of maximum price can also create\r\n\r\ndifficulty  and  curtail  the  flexibility  of  actions  by  the\r\n\r\ncompany.  The buying and selling process is a very dynamic  one.\r\n\r\nThe  parameters  and market forces change very fast.   Hence,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask the Minister: would it not create   a  better\r\n\r\nchance  for them to buy back their shares if certain information\r\n\r\nis  not  disclosed to the public, such as the limitation on  the\r\n\r\ndate  as  well as the maximum price they want to pay?  Moreover,\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  the company has to seek shareholders'  approval\r\n\r\nprior to taking action is in itself a deterrent to the companies\r\n\r\nconcerned.   There is also the risk that the public announcement\r\n\r\nof  the  company's intention to buy back their shares may  cause\r\n\r\nthe potential sellers to ask for higher prices.  In the end, the\r\n\r\ncompany  actually is at a disadvantage when they buy back  their\r\n\r\nshares  at a higher price than it originally intended.  The  end\r\n\r\nresult is that companies may actually choose to rather buy other\r\n\r\ncompanies'  shares, which is subject to less restrictions,  than\r\n\r\nto  actually  go through a more tedious process of  buying  back\r\n\r\ntheir own shares, no matter how attractive their own shares  may\r\n\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister may wish to clarify these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould like to begin by declaring my interest as a director of  a\r\n\r\nsecurities  company.  I shall, however, be  making  my  comments\r\n\r\nfrom  the  perspective  of  the  retail  investor  and  minority\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to legislation, to allow for the\r\n\r\npurchase or acquisition of their own shares by companies,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwill  pave the way for companies, particularly the listed  ones,\r\n\r\nto better manage the return on equity, or, in today's jargon, to\r\n\r\n\"create  more  value\".  It will constitute another milestone  in\r\n\r\nthe development of the Singapore stock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I raise two sets of issues regarding the buy-back\r\n\r\nscheme, namely of safeguards and tax implications, I would  like\r\n\r\nto make some general comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, companies embarking on such a scheme may send\r\n\r\nmixed  signals  about business direction and  growth  potential.\r\n\r\nExcept for the inaugural exercise with the passage of this Bill,\r\n\r\nwe  would  implicitly be expecting the investor at large  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to understand why a company is using its surplus funds  to\r\n\r\nbuy  back  its  own shares instead of deploying these  funds  to\r\n\r\nfurther  business  expansion.  It is  entirely  possible  for  a\r\n\r\ncompany to use surplus funds to buy back shares, only to go back\r\n\r\nto  shareholders  later on for new capital for expansion.   This\r\n\r\nhas  been the experience of companies in the other markets.  How\r\n\r\nwill  the  Singaporean-based  investor  interpret  such  actions\r\n\r\nwhich, when taken together, may appear somewhat ironical?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike reported earnings and the requisite announcements\r\n\r\nfor major corporate developments, share buy-backs can provide  a\r\n\r\nvery  strong  signal to \"outside\" investors of  what  management\r\n\r\nthinks  of  the prevailing share values.  Given the significance\r\n\r\nof  this  interpretation,  several questions  arise  as  to  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  sufficient safeguards for  minority  shareholders\r\n\r\nagainst  any abuse or manipulation by management and/or majority\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Need to provide enough safeguards</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to ensure that enough\r\n\r\nsafeguards are provided against the following possibilities:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, manipulation by company insiders to manage\r\n\r\nreported  earnings-related  benchmarks,  such  as  earnings  per\r\n\r\nshare,  so  as  to detract from or mask unsatisfactory  business\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, possibility of management spending too much time\r\n\r\nand  attention on managing share prices rather than  the  actual\r\n\r\nbusiness  itself,  particularly in  times  of  prolonged  market\r\n\r\nvolatility  and  depressed  share  prices  such  as  now.    The\r\n\r\ntemptation to buy back \"undervalued\" shares would be  too  great\r\n\r\nto resist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the possibility of collusion between major\r\n\r\nshareholders   and   company  at   the   expense   of   minority\r\n\r\nshareholders.   Although  there is  a  provision  to  specify  a\r\n\r\nmaximum price, should there be a cap on the premium on the price\r\n\r\nto  be  paid for shares to be bought back?  For example, the  5%\r\n\r\nlimit  in  the  UK?  Or do we want to employ a one-broker  rule,\r\n\r\nsimilar to that in force in the US?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, any timing differences which will disadvantage\r\n\r\nminority  shareholders - the obligation to cancel shares  bought\r\n\r\nback   is   helpful  but  is  there  still  room  for   possible\r\n\r\nmanipulation?   Ultimately,  the  key  is  efficiency   in   the\r\n\r\ndissemination of information and transparency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, utilisation of distributable profits earned in\r\n\r\nearlier years.  Should there be a time bar or will the 10% limit\r\n\r\nto shares to be purchased be sufficient?\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tax implications</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, a retail investor who sells his shares on\r\n\r\nthe  market  for  a profit does not pay any capital  gains  tax.\r\n\r\nWill this remain the same when he sells his shares as part of  a\r\n\r\nbuy-back scheme?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a listed company, Singapore Press Holdings,\r\n\r\nembarked on a capital reduction exercise, which sought to return\r\n\r\n$1.22  per share held.  It then transpired that out of the $1.22\r\n\r\ncapital returned, 52 cents were deemed as capital, and hence tax\r\n\r\nfree,   while  the  remaining  70  cents  were  treated   as   a\r\n\r\ndistribution of dividend, and hence taxable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this exercise is different from a buy-back scheme,\r\n\r\nit is nonetheless instructive for us to study the tax angles. If\r\n\r\npart  or  all of the share buy-back proceeds are deemed taxable,\r\n\r\nhow will the retail\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninvestor  know the difference?  Even if it were so,  would  this\r\n\r\nunwittingly  lead to a two-tier market?  Or will companies  have\r\n\r\nto  bear  the tax burden, which implicitly raises their purchase\r\n\r\ncosts?  It would appear that the simpler and more tax-consistent\r\n\r\nit  is  for  the retail investor, the more successful and  well-accepted the scheme will be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues raised above are more details to be ironed\r\n\r\nout  than grounds against the scheme.  Apart from putting in the\r\n\r\nnecessary   safeguards,  investor  education  will  be   equally\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I believe that once minority shareholders\r\n\r\nunderstand the rationale behind the scheme and are assured  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  enough safeguards, they would embrace  the  buy-back\r\n\r\nscheme  readily, as it would add another exciting  dimension  to\r\n\r\ntheir investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I wish to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish to express\r\n\r\nmy support for this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation permitting companies to buy back or redeem\r\n\r\ntheir  shares  from  shareholders has been  enacted  in  various\r\n\r\njurisdictions.  In principle, it is desirable for  companies  to\r\n\r\nhave   the  flexibility  and  power  to  do  so,  provided  that\r\n\r\nshareholders and creditors are adequately protected.  Indeed, as\r\n\r\nthe  experience of other jurisdictions indicates, this power  to\r\n\r\nbuy  back  shares  has proved very useful to companies  and  has\r\n\r\ngenerally  given rise to few problems.  I expect the  amendments\r\n\r\nwill   be   warmly  welcomed  by  the  business  and  investment\r\n\r\ncommunities here in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many companies, the proposed amendments contained in this\r\n\r\nBill  will  provide  the  option  of  a  more  flexible  capital\r\n\r\nstructure on which real economic and financial advantages  could\r\n\r\nbe  obtained  if  the  power to repurchase shares  is  exercised\r\n\r\njudiciously.  However, I have the following five points to raise\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to  whether  the proposed  amendments  will  allow\r\n\r\nSingapore companies to achieve the maximum benefits that could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  derived  from  having  share buy-back  legislation  of  this\r\n\r\nnature, as well as whether the regulatory framework provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  proposed legislation will be able to protect creditors  and\r\n\r\nshareholders of the company adequately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue I would like to raise relates to market\r\n\r\npurchases  by  public  listed  companies.   Under  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection  76E,  market  purchases  are  permitted  on  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange if the listed company has been authorised in advance by\r\n\r\nits shareholders.  To obtain the authorisation, the company,  in\r\n\r\nits notice of general meeting, has to specify among other things\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  price  which  may be paid  for  the  shares.   The\r\n\r\nobjective  of  this  requirement  seems  to  be  protection   of\r\n\r\nshareholders' interest by placing a cap on the maximum amount of\r\n\r\nfunds  which  may be used for the purchases.  However,  this  is\r\n\r\nopen  to abuse and manipulation.   To add to the concerns of  my\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, the proposed maximum price,  being\r\n\r\nprice sensitive information, will have an impact on the movement\r\n\r\nof  the share price because it reflects management's view of the\r\n\r\nperformance and prospects of the company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices of securities are largely influenced by investor\r\n\r\nconfidence which can be boosted or shaken by management's action\r\n\r\nor  announcement.  Management must therefore exercise great care\r\n\r\nin  arriving at a proposed maximum price before disseminating to\r\n\r\nthe  shareholders by way of the notice of resolution.  Once  the\r\n\r\nnotice is released and publicised, investors will scrutinise the\r\n\r\nproposal  and  come  to their own judgment about  the  company's\r\n\r\nperformance  and  prospects  even  before  the  holding  of  the\r\n\r\nshareholders'  meeting where the directors have the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto explain their views on the proposal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister, therefore, reconsider the merits of\r\n\r\nrequiring such a specific information as the maximum share price\r\n\r\nto  be made known and weigh them against its potential for abuse\r\n\r\nand  manipulation?   If  the  maximum  share  price  has  to  be\r\n\r\nspecified, I believe there should be rules or guidelines on  the\r\n\r\nsteps and precautions to be taken in determining\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis maximum price so that companies would not arbitrarily set a\r\n\r\nprice which is without basis and proper justification.   As this\r\n\r\nissue relates to listed companies, perhaps the Stock Exchange of\r\n\r\nSingapore  could incorporate the appropriate safeguards  in  its\r\n\r\nregulations on market purchases by companies listed on the SES.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this issue of market purchases by listed\r\n\r\ncompanies,  I  would like to propose that there should  also  be\r\n\r\nsome  safeguards  in relation to the execution of  the  buy-back\r\n\r\ntrades.  Will  the Minister consider imposing restrictions,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  that  a company cannot purchase its own  shares  at  a\r\n\r\nprice  higher than 5% above the average of the last share  price\r\n\r\nrecorded  on the last five days on which the shares were  traded\r\n\r\non  the  Stock  Exchange?  This will prevent  the  company  from\r\n\r\nchasing the share price up and paying unnecessarily high  prices\r\n\r\nin a volatile market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the necessity of restricting\r\n\r\npermitted  purchases to ordinary shares in  the  company.   This\r\n\r\npoint  has also been raised by my colleague, Mr Leong Horn  Kee.\r\n\r\nThe   term  \"ordinary  shares\"  has  not  been  defined  in  the\r\n\r\namendments nor in the principal Act, but would presumably  refer\r\n\r\nto  voting  shares  or equity shares as compared  to  preference\r\n\r\nshares  which carry special rights with respect to, for example,\r\n\r\nrepayment of capital, dividends and voting.  There does not seem\r\n\r\nto  be  a  clear  reason why other shares,  perhaps  other  than\r\n\r\nredeemable  preference shares, could not be repurchased  by  the\r\n\r\ncompany.   However, while I believe that it may not be necessary\r\n\r\nto  restrict share buy-backs to ordinary shares, I do think that\r\n\r\nit is necessary to provide that only fully paid up shares may be\r\n\r\nrepurchased,  which  has  not been  expressly  provided  in  the\r\n\r\namendments.  Otherwise, creditors may lose a valuable  asset  on\r\n\r\nliquidation  of  the  company, ie, of uncalled  capital  if  the\r\n\r\nshares  which  have  been repurchased and  cancelled  were  only\r\n\r\npartially paid up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, again I share Mr Leong's concern, under the\r\n\r\nproposed amendments, a company can only purchase up\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  10%  of the issued share capital during the relevant period.\r\n\r\nIt  seems  that a cap of 10% is an arbitrary limit.  Given  that\r\n\r\none  of  the  reasons for a company to want  to  repurchase  the\r\n\r\nshares  is  to  make  efficient use of the  surplus  funds,  and\r\n\r\ncircumstances  differ  from  one  company  to  the   next,   the\r\n\r\napplication  of such a fixed cap uniformly on all companies  may\r\n\r\nbe too inflexible.  Although having a limit may be prudent for a\r\n\r\nstart, this issue should be reviewed from time to time to  allow\r\n\r\nfor  a gradual liberalisation of the rules over time. This limit\r\n\r\nshould  be raised or lifted when companies become more  familiar\r\n\r\nwith  the buy-back procedure and when shareholders become better\r\n\r\nable  to  evaluate  how proposed buy-back schemes  affect  their\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth point is in regard to the adequacy of the\r\n\r\nproposed  provisions in safeguarding the interest of  creditors.\r\n\r\nI  observe  that  the main protection afforded to  creditors  is\r\n\r\nfound in new section 76F(3) where every director or manager of a\r\n\r\ncompany  who  approves or authorises the purchase or acquisition\r\n\r\nof  the  company's  own  shares  knowing  that  the  company  is\r\n\r\ninsolvent  or will become insolvent as a result of the  purchase\r\n\r\nis made personally and criminally liable.  However, the purchase\r\n\r\nis  not  void nor voidable, and creditors will have to  sue  the\r\n\r\ndirectors and managers in their personal capacity to recover the\r\n\r\nshortfall.   This  may be cold comfort to the creditors  if  the\r\n\r\ndirectors and managers are of shallow means.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as mentioned by my colleague, Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua, I hope the Minister will clarify a number of related issues\r\n\r\non  the  taxation implications.  On the part of the company,  as\r\n\r\nthe  consideration  will  be paid out of distributable  profits,\r\n\r\ndoes the company have to deduct tax at source as in the case for\r\n\r\ndividend payment, or are there any situations where the purchase\r\n\r\nof  shares could be regarded as something akin to a distribution\r\n\r\nmade as a result of reduction of the company's share capital and\r\n\r\nhence not accessible to tax?  Lastly, if tax is to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeducted at source, could the individual shareholder obtain a\r\n\r\ntax credit in respect of the amount deducted?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister will enlighten us on these issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, I am in support of the Bill. I\r\n\r\nshall confine myself to the buy-back scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members have mentioned earlier, other jurisdictions such\r\n\r\nas  the  United  States, Australia and New Zealand, have similar\r\n\r\nprovisions.  This is to be welcomed as Singapore is behind time.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  are certain concerns which  I  would  like  the\r\n\r\nMinister to address.  Both Mr Leong Horn Kee and Mr Ong Kian Min\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned about the 10% limitation.  I am aware  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister may, by Gazette notification, increase this limitation,\r\n\r\nbut I wonder why the 10% was picked up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue that has to be resolved - I think Mrs\r\n\r\nLim  Hwee  Hua has also raised this point - is this question  of\r\n\r\ntaxation, which is very important.  Whether there is going to be\r\n\r\ntax  liability,  I  think both the public and the  companies  at\r\n\r\nlarge  must  know  beforehand what is the  Minister's  stand  on\r\n\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the price of shares is sensitive information, the\r\n\r\nregulation  must be drafted in such a way that  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  are protected, especially now that there is a  depressed\r\n\r\nmarket  in Singapore, any buy-back scheme must ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nminority interests are protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is another issue which I would like to raise.\r\n\r\nAlthough  at  a  company's general meeting, notices  are  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven, it would be prudent to have a proper advertisement in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  to announce any scheme of this nature, so  that  the\r\n\r\npublic  as  well  as the members of the company  will  be  in  a\r\n\r\nposition  to  respond to this.  In this case,  I  refer  to  new\r\n\r\nsection 76C.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other issue which I would like to find out from\r\n\r\nthe  Minister is this.  The role which the Stock Exchange  would\r\n\r\nbe  playing  is very important.  So far, I think it  is  to  the\r\n\r\ncredit  of our Stock Exchange scheme that we have a fairly  open\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntransparent market.  It is very important for the Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nof  Singapore to see that this provision is regulated in such  a\r\n\r\nway that there is no abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  allowing  me to join in the debate  on  the  Companies\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill.  Before I proceed, I would like to declare  my\r\n\r\ninterest on the subject matter.  I am a practising solicitor and\r\n\r\nwould  have  in the course of my work to advise clients  on  the\r\n\r\nCompanies Act, including the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, apart from taking the opportunity to clarify\r\n\r\ncertain provisions of the Act, is radical in nature as it  seeks\r\n\r\nto   introduce   share  buy-back  schemes   into   our   company\r\n\r\nlegislation.  Up until now, a general rule in the company law is\r\n\r\nthat a company may not return any assets to its members while it\r\n\r\nis  a  going  concern,  except in the  form  of  dividends  paid\r\n\r\ngenerally out of profits.  As it is commonly understood, when  a\r\n\r\ncompany  is  liquidated, the shareholders are the  last  to  get\r\n\r\ntheir  money back.  The creditors will get their payments  first\r\n\r\nbefore  the  shareholders  get anything.   Accordingly,  if  the\r\n\r\nshareholders  are  allowed to get their monies  back  first,  it\r\n\r\nwould  reverse  the order of payment as it is understood  for  a\r\n\r\ncompany  in  liquidation, and this would  not  be  fair  to  the\r\n\r\ncreditors.   When a creditor does business with the company,  he\r\n\r\ndoes so on the faith that the capital shall be applied only  for\r\n\r\nthe purpose of business and he has therefore the right to say to\r\n\r\nthe  company  that  the company must keep the  capital  and  not\r\n\r\nreturn it to the shareholders.  Otherwise, the creditor will not\r\n\r\nhave  faith  nor confidence to do business with the company  and\r\n\r\ncommerce,  as we know it, may not have taken off to  the  extent\r\n\r\nthat we see it today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that the Companies Act has a rather\r\n\r\nstrict  regimen  to  ensure  the maintenance  of  capital  in  a\r\n\r\ncompany.   This  is seen, for instance, in general  prohibitions\r\n\r\nagainst  providing  financial  assistance  in  the  purchase  or\r\n\r\nacquisition of a company's shares without strictly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nobserving the proper procedures and reduction of capital without\r\n\r\ngetting  the court's sanction.  These restrictions are generally\r\n\r\nmeant to provide safeguard for the creditors of a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, does the introduction of share buy-back schemes fly in\r\n\r\nthe  face of all that the company laws seek to do, that  is,  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  interest  of  creditors through  the  doctrine  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  of  capital?  Sir, I think  not.   Looking  at  the\r\n\r\noverall  scheme of the proposed share buy-back provisions  under\r\n\r\nthe Bill, one gets the impression that the objective of the Bill\r\n\r\nis  not  to  return capital at the expense of creditors  but  to\r\n\r\nensure  the  proper management of a company's capital.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  a  company may pay off any paid-up capital by returning\r\n\r\nthat  which  is  in excess of the needs of the  company  or  the\r\n\r\ncompany  may  reduce  the paid-up value of  the  shares  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and  reflect what is left of the capital after  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  reduced  by  trading losses.  To  achieve  this  end,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  would have to go through the relative inconvenience  of\r\n\r\nhaving  to  petition to the court to get its  approval  and  the\r\n\r\nprocess  is subject to the right of the creditors to  object  to\r\n\r\nthe reduction of capital.  Besides reduction of capital does not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  reduce the total number of members of the  company.\r\n\r\nWhat  the reduction does is that it uses paid-up capital  across\r\n\r\nthe  board.   In  other  words, reduction of  capital  does  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  achieve  the  objective of  reducing  the  absolute\r\n\r\nnumber of shareholders in a company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as proposed, the share buy-back scheme allows a\r\n\r\ncompany  to manage its capital more effectively.  A company  may\r\n\r\nwant  to  buy back its own shares for many reasons.  This  would\r\n\r\ninclude,  for  instance,  a desire to  return  surplus  cash  to\r\n\r\nshareholders  so  that  the capital may be  put  to  better  use\r\n\r\nelsewhere  or to increase earnings per share or net  assets  per\r\n\r\nshare, or to increase the marketability of the company's shares,\r\n\r\nor perhaps defend the company against possible takeovers.  Where\r\n\r\nthe  company intends to reduce the capital of the company or the\r\n\r\nshareholder base of the company, the share buy-back\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscheme  allows the management the additional option  to  achieve\r\n\r\nthe   objective  without  the  necessary  inconvenience  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting arrangements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, share buy-back schemes were introduced much earlier in\r\n\r\na  number  of countries. These countries include, for  instance,\r\n\r\nthe United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong.  The\r\n\r\napplication  of share buy-back scheme in these jurisdictions  is\r\n\r\nbecoming   increasingly  widespread   these   days.    In   some\r\n\r\njurisdictions such as the United States, the shares  subject  to\r\n\r\nre-purchase  are taken out of circulation but remain  in  issue.\r\n\r\nIn  others,  shares which have been re-purchased are  cancelled.\r\n\r\nWhatever  the  approach, the economic  outcome  is  similar.   A\r\n\r\nreduction  in the number of shares in circulation is  likely  to\r\n\r\nincrease  in the value of the remaining shares arising from  the\r\n\r\ninterplay  of supply and demand factors.  Additionally,  if  the\r\n\r\nearning  potential remains relatively undiminished, the earnings\r\n\r\nper share will increase and, in theory, that should increase the\r\n\r\nshare price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as existing creditors go, the Bill seeks to protect\r\n\r\ntheir interest in a number of ways.  First, no more than 10%  of\r\n\r\nthe  shares  may  be  purchased by the  company  or  such  other\r\n\r\npercentages  as are allowed by the Minister.  Its limitation  to\r\n\r\n10%  of  share  capital serves to ensure limited reduction  each\r\n\r\ntime.  Secondly, there is a requirement that shares can only  be\r\n\r\nbought  out  of  the  profits  of  the  company.   Thirdly,  the\r\n\r\ndirectors and officers must be satisfied that the company is not\r\n\r\ninsolvent at the time of the purchase of the shares.   The  Bill\r\n\r\nsays a company is insolvent if  (i) it cannot pay its debt as it\r\n\r\nfalls due or (ii) the value of the company's assets is less than\r\n\r\nthe  value of its liabilities, including contingent liabilities.\r\n\r\nIf  the company fails either of the two tests, it is regarded as\r\n\r\ninsolvent  and cannot do a share buy-back scheme.  By  insisting\r\n\r\nthat  the purchase price may only be paid out of the profits  of\r\n\r\nthe  company, the creditors at least can have the assurance that\r\n\r\nshareholders cannot simply declare a return of capital to  their\r\n\r\ndetriment.  Through this, the share\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuy-back scheme is able to achieve flexibility of capital\r\n\r\nmanagement with minimal risk of compromising any party's\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I note that the Government has taken measures to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the shareholders and the creditors  are  protected\r\n\r\nunder  the  Bill, I do have a number of concerns which  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to point out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, by allowing the share buy-back, companies may be\r\n\r\nencouraged to return surplus capital instead of using the  money\r\n\r\nfor  high-yielding  investment  opportunities.   The  return  of\r\n\r\nsurplus  capital  may  be  an  indication  of  weakness  in  the\r\n\r\ncorporation's strategic plan and the return of capital may  just\r\n\r\nserve to exacerbate that weakness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, by reducing its working capital through the share\r\n\r\nbuy-back  programme,  the proportion of  debt  would  invariably\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  company's  capital  structure.   This   would\r\n\r\nincrease the company's financial risk.  We should also note that\r\n\r\nthe   share   buy-back  results  in  an  indirect  transfer   of\r\n\r\nbondholders'  wealth to the shareholders.   This  is  applicable\r\n\r\nespecially  to companies that use long-term debt as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nfinancing.   By  buying back shares, the company  is,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nincreasing  its gearing ratio while reducing the  proportion  of\r\n\r\nits  financing  through equity.  Because of the  increase  in  a\r\n\r\ncompany's  financial  risk,  the bonds  are  now  riskier.   But\r\n\r\nbondholders are not compensated for the higher risk with  higher\r\n\r\ncoupon  interest.  This would invariably make  bond  issuing  in\r\n\r\nsuch an environment less attractive and in the long term, it may\r\n\r\nimpact on our Government's effort to develop the bond market  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, share buy-back schemes increase the risk of\r\n\r\ntriggering the provisions of Rule 33 of the Takeover Code  which\r\n\r\ncompels  the making of a takeover bid if the party concerned  is\r\n\r\nleft  with  holding  25% or more of the shares  and  unwittingly\r\n\r\nacquires  shares which are in excess of the relevant  threshold.\r\n\r\nIn  such an event, the shareholders may not be prepared to mount\r\n\r\na takeover bid.  To avoid such a possibility, it may be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  ask  for waiver in advance  from  the  Securities\r\n\r\nIndustry Council or the Minister.  Additionally, in the case  of\r\n\r\nlisted  companies,  a shareholder may not  by  choice  become  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial shareholder in a company but become one as a  result\r\n\r\nof  the  share  buy-back  scheme.  The consequence  of  being  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial shareholder is that his identity would  have  to  be\r\n\r\ndisclosed to the public.  Now, Sir, not everyone would  like  to\r\n\r\nhave  their identity disclosed as substantial shareholders in  a\r\n\r\nlisted company.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in most other jurisdictions, share buy-backs are\r\n\r\ngenerally  regarded as positive information.  As a  result,  the\r\n\r\nshare   price   would  tend  to  rise  upon  a  share   buy-back\r\n\r\nannouncement.  Because of this, I am concerned, as was expressed\r\n\r\nby  several  of  my colleagues earlier, that the  potential  for\r\n\r\ninsider  dealing may arise.  Quite obviously, those with  inside\r\n\r\ninformation may be tempted to trade on the shares before the buy-back  scheme is announced.  A curious situation may  also  arise\r\n\r\nwhere  the  company engaging in share buy-back may be  privy  to\r\n\r\nprice-sensitive information.  For instance, what if the  company\r\n\r\nwas working on a major invention which it knows would affect the\r\n\r\nshare  value  and  which  it  intends  to  announce  after   the\r\n\r\ncompletion of the share buy-back scheme?  Would the Minister say\r\n\r\nthat  the company is engaging in insider dealing?  Additionally,\r\n\r\nthere  is always the possibility of manipulation by unscrupulous\r\n\r\nmanagers  trying to prop up their share prices due to  a  market\r\n\r\ndownturn  or poor intrinsic value.  Alternatively, managers  and\r\n\r\ndirectors  with share option schemes may prop up  the  value  of\r\n\r\ntheir  options by initiating price buy-back schemes not for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  company  but  for  their  own  benefit.    The\r\n\r\nconsequent rise in value of the shares will substantially profit\r\n\r\nthese managers.  I would like to ask of the Minister whether  he\r\n\r\nwould  consider  managers  initiating  share  buy-back  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of enhancing the value of their stock options as  being\r\n\r\nengaging in acts of market manipulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I have expressed some reservations, it is not to\r\n\r\nbe taken to mean that I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndo  not  support the Bill.  On balance, I think the benefits  of\r\n\r\nthe share buy-back outweigh the risks.  At the moment, there are\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards to deal with this concern.  So long  as  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  continues to promote transparency within  the  legal\r\n\r\nframework  of  our companies, both in the business dealings  and\r\n\r\nthe  shareholders'  structure,  the  integrity  of  our  company\r\n\r\nlegislation  should  not  be compromised  as  a  result  of  the\r\n\r\nintroduction of a share buy-back provision.  I would, therefore,\r\n\r\nsupport the Companies (Amendment) Bill as a matter of policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having stated my general support for the Bill, there\r\n\r\nare, however, a few minor drafting details that I would like  to\r\n\r\ntouch on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend the definition\r\n\r\nof  \"interest  in  the shares of a company\" in section  7(4)  to\r\n\r\nincrease the threshold upon which a person is deemed to have  an\r\n\r\ninterest  in  a  body corporate from 15% to 20%  of  the  voting\r\n\r\npower.  In the present form, section 7(4) has often caused  much\r\n\r\nconfusion.   The often asked question is whether in  a  circular\r\n\r\nfashion, the section applies to shareholders of a company who is\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have  an  interest in the  shares  by  virtue  of  a\r\n\r\npotentially unlimited change of 15% interest.  In a way,  clause\r\n\r\n2  of the Bill seeks to overcome that by making it clear in  the\r\n\r\nnotes  that the purpose was \"to restrict its application to  not\r\n\r\nmore than one level\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I am happy to learn that the Ministry has\r\n\r\nrecognised  the need to clarify the application of  the  present\r\n\r\nsection  7(4),  I  submit that the draftsman has  not  gone  far\r\n\r\nenough.   In  fact, I would say that the proposed  provision  is\r\n\r\nstill unclear.  Rather than restricting the application to  just\r\n\r\none  tier, when read literally, there is a possibility that  the\r\n\r\nclause  may  apply to more than one tier.  The  clause  provides\r\n\r\nthat  the person shall have an interest in the share in which  a\r\n\r\nbody  has  an interest in if, inter alia, the body corporate  is\r\n\r\naccustomed,  whether  formally  or  informally,  to  acting   in\r\n\r\naccordance with the directions of the person concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In using the word \"informal\", one would have much\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  applying the provision with precision.   In  its\r\n\r\nordinary   meaning,  it  is  conceivable  that  the   management\r\n\r\nconsultant  to  a company, which habitually acts  in  accordance\r\n\r\nwith  the  management consultant's direction, may also  have  an\r\n\r\ninterest in the shares of the company that the company is deemed\r\n\r\nto  have  an interest in.  Will the Minister explain if this  is\r\n\r\nthe intention of the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the words \"controlling interest\" are used to\r\n\r\ndetermine  if the person has an interest in the body  corporate.\r\n\r\nThere  is, however, no definition of what the words \"controlling\r\n\r\ninterest\"  mean.   Would  the Minister clarify  what  the  words\r\n\r\n\"controlling  interest\" mean, having regard to the  use  of  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of  shares as being more than 20%  in  the  proposed\r\n\r\nsection   4A?    Does  \"controlling  interest\"  therefore   mean\r\n\r\nsomething more than the percentage of voting rights attached  to\r\n\r\nthe  shares?   If it does, will the Minister please  explain  to\r\n\r\nthis House what these interests are?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 sets out the new sections 76B to 76G of the Act\r\n\r\nwhich relate to the share buy-back scheme.  In the new sections,\r\n\r\nthe  words \"ordinary shares\" are used.  Ordinary shares  in  the\r\n\r\nAct  are rather not defined words.  Presumably, ordinary  shares\r\n\r\nare   used  to  exclude  redeemable  preference  shares  or  any\r\n\r\npreference shares for that matter.  Does it therefore mean that,\r\n\r\napart  from preference shares, the provision of the new  section\r\n\r\n76B  will  be  applicable  to all classes  of  ordinary  shares,\r\n\r\nirrespective of whether or not there are further differentiation\r\n\r\nwithin  those  classes  of  ordinary  shares?   How  would   the\r\n\r\ndefinition of equal access scheme apply in cases where different\r\n\r\nclasses of ordinary shares have been created?\r\n\r\nThe  new  section 76C (2) provides, inter alia, that the  notice\r\n\r\nspecifying the intention to propose the resolution to  authorise\r\n\r\nan  off-market  purchase referred to in the  earlier  subsection\r\n\r\nmust, among other things, determine the maximum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprice  which may be paid for the shares.  On a plain reading  of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, one wonders how a notice can determine the  price  of\r\n\r\nshares.  Does it mean that the notice must state how the maximum\r\n\r\nprice  of the shares is to be determined?  In its present  form,\r\n\r\nthe expression does seem a little odd.  Sir, I think it would be\r\n\r\nmore  accurate to describe the notice as specifying the  maximum\r\n\r\nprice  of  shares rather than determining the maximum  price  of\r\n\r\nshares, as is presently stated in the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same comments apply to new section 76E (2) (b) as well. New\r\n\r\nsection  76C  (4) also provides that the authority for  an  off-market  purchase referred to in the section may,  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  be varied or revoked by the company in a general meeting.\r\n\r\nHaving  provided for such powers, the new provision is, however,\r\n\r\nunclear  as  to  what  happens  after  those  powers  have  been\r\n\r\nexercised  by  the company.  Does it mean that everything  which\r\n\r\nhas  already  been done prior to the revocation or variation  of\r\n\r\nthe powers is no longer valid to the extent of the variation  or\r\n\r\nrevocation?  The same comments apply to section 76E (5) as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, new section 76C (6) defines an \"equal access scheme\" as\r\n\r\none which, inter alia, satisfies the requirements of all persons\r\n\r\nhaving  a reasonable opportunity to accept offers made to  them.\r\n\r\nThe  use  of  the  term \"reasonable opportunity\"  may  introduce\r\n\r\nuncertainty into the legislation. It may be better to  introduce\r\n\r\na  fixed minimum period during which the offer is open.  If left\r\n\r\nas it is, it may be open to each individual shareholder to argue\r\n\r\nthat,   given  its  present  circumstance,  he  was  not   given\r\n\r\nreasonable opportunity to accept the offer.  Additionally,  with\r\n\r\nrespect to new section 76C(6)(c), it may be neater if the  words\r\n\r\n\"that  there  shall  be disregarded\" be deleted  and  substitute\r\n\r\ntherefor  with  the  word \"for\". This would  make  the  drafting\r\n\r\nsimpler and neater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have chosen to confine my comments principally to the\r\n\r\nshare  buy back scheme and I would like the Minister to  respond\r\n\r\nto these comments.  But for the comments, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we are in search of\r\n\r\nlighter  regulation to provide more freedom for  businesses  and\r\n\r\ncompanies in Singapore to liberalise without creating an  unfair\r\n\r\nmarket  or  a market which people can take advantage of,  to  do\r\n\r\nunfair things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, we realise that we are letting go of\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  institutions  of  old.  We  are  letting  go   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's close supervision, to some degree, and are deciding\r\n\r\nto rely on some other institutions more. We are also letting go,\r\n\r\namong the choice of institutions, of the Court's since the share\r\n\r\nbuy  back scheme will reduce the role of restructuring under the\r\n\r\nCourt's  supervision.  The institutions we  then  turn  to  will\r\n\r\nincreasingly  be  the  SES and, more than  that,  the  investing\r\n\r\npublic,  and  we have an increasing number of citizens  who  are\r\n\r\nusing their private funds, their CPF funds, for this purpose  to\r\n\r\ncreate a citizenry who are also shareholders in our companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, with this background, turn to my concerns regarding\r\n\r\ndisclosure and transparency as regards the share buy back scheme\r\n\r\nand  the deeming provision.  Let me try to avoid repeating  many\r\n\r\nof the points my colleagues before me have made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first concern with the share buy back scheme is that it is\r\n\r\npossible  that  it may be open to price manipulation.   This  is\r\n\r\nprimarily because the investing public often does not know  what\r\n\r\nis  happening when a buy back starts to happen.  The  provisions\r\n\r\nin  the  Act  provide that notice be given to  the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies  (ROC).  However, I think that in the climate  of  the\r\n\r\nsmall investors in Singapore, this may be insufficient. The  SES\r\n\r\nundoubtedly will also make the buy back decisions known  to  the\r\n\r\nmass  net.  But again, this might not be enough since  the  mass\r\n\r\nnet goes to mainly people with seats in the Stock Exchange.   It\r\n\r\nmight not reach the smaller investor.  The smaller investor then\r\n\r\nwill  see the price go up or down and the volumes go up and down\r\n\r\nand  there  might be some sort of psychological effect  on  them\r\n\r\nwhich  they  may  not understand.  They might  therefore  follow\r\n\r\nblindly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as regards the share buy back scheme, clearly the\r\n\r\nBill  is  on good ground in providing that for listed companies,\r\n\r\nthis  must be bought from the open market.  However, Sir,  there\r\n\r\nare  two dangers.  The first is of a bail out.  Even though  you\r\n\r\nbuy  in  an open market, it depends on who has made, what shares\r\n\r\nare  available.  There may therefore be a danger  of  collusions\r\n\r\nwhereby major shareholders in need of funding make their  shares\r\n\r\navailable at exactly the right time.  The Minister might respond\r\n\r\nthat  these  possible  collusions would  be  tackled  under  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  insider trading rules.  However, it seems  to  me  that\r\n\r\nthese   rules  may  not  be  themselves  sufficient  since   the\r\n\r\ninformation of when a company buy back will happen may not in  a\r\n\r\nsense  be price sensitive since the price is pretty much  fixed.\r\n\r\nIt  is  more a question of when the shares are available  rather\r\n\r\nthan what price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I want to make about the share buy back is the\r\n\r\nopposite  effect.  Rather  than  having  a  bail-out  of   major\r\n\r\nshareholders,  there is in fact the effect of consolidating  and\r\n\r\nincreasing  the  effective holdings of the bigger  shareholders.\r\n\r\nAnd  here I share the concern of Mr Sin Boon Ann that this  will\r\n\r\neffectively   increase   the   percentage   held   by    certain\r\n\r\nshareholders.   And  the question is whether the  Takeover  Code\r\n\r\nwould be triggered.  This is not clear, since section 213(3)  of\r\n\r\nthe  Companies Act provides that the effect must be of acquiring\r\n\r\neffective control, that  is, acquiring shares.  In the event  of\r\n\r\na  share  buy back, the shareholder does not acquire any  shares\r\n\r\nbut,  nevertheless,  may find himself put  above  the  statutory\r\n\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point relates to the deeming provision. As Mr Sin has\r\n\r\nsaid, it is good for clarity in this issue that for too long, we\r\n\r\nhave   been  concerned  that  deeming  provision  upon   deeming\r\n\r\nprovision   will  lead  to endless tiers  of  deemed  interests.\r\n\r\nHowever,  there  is some concern that we may be  moving  in  the\r\n\r\nopposite direction of greater transparency.  This is because  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  using one tier only. It will be more possible to  have\r\n\r\nshell  companies.   With  these comments,  I  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all\r\n\r\nspeakers   have  expressed  some  similar  concerns  about   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  Bill.   I  will  deal  with  each   speaker\r\n\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked whether we should not allow the\r\n\r\nbuy   back scheme to be extended to all shares rather than  just\r\n\r\nordinary shares.  The reason why ordinary shares were stipulated\r\n\r\nis  because  they form the bulk of the shares issued.   Although\r\n\r\nthe  number of preference shares is not insignificant,  what  we\r\n\r\nare  really  talking  about  are the  non-redeemable  preference\r\n\r\nshares where such a provision of buy back might be extended  to.\r\n\r\nFor  the  time being, the proposal is to confine it to  ordinary\r\n\r\nshares until we gain more experience in this particular process.\r\n\r\nGenerally,  I would say that the provisions are on  the  prudent\r\n\r\nside  because  of our lack of experience in administrating  such\r\n\r\nchanges. We have perhaps over provided for the protection of the\r\n\r\nsmall  shareholders  at the expense of flexibility.  Hence,  the\r\n\r\nlimitation  of the share buy back to 10%  for each instance  and\r\n\r\nthe  cap  on  the  price movement of 5% of the average  of  five\r\n\r\npreceding  days'  share prices.  Also, there  is  the  need  for\r\n\r\nshareholders'  approval on the maximum share  prices  allowable.\r\n\r\nAll this may sound restrictive, but they are designed to protect\r\n\r\nsmaller  investors who may not be familiar with  the  procedures\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  may  not comprehend the implications  if  more\r\n\r\nflexibility is introduced into the scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come next to Mrs Lim Hwee Hua. She is concerned that the buy\r\n\r\nback  scheme itself may trigger a signal to outsiders that there\r\n\r\nis  something basically wrong with the company for it to want to\r\n\r\nbuy back its own shares. Is that the concern?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> No. It is more a signal of how management\r\n\r\nitself  feels  about the value of the prevailing  share  prices.\r\n\r\nThey may think it is undervalued.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> One of the main reasons for companies\r\n\r\ndeciding  to  buy  back its shares is that  it  has  accumulated\r\n\r\nsubstantial excess capital which it finds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  place  into attractive  investments.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nbelieve  - unless you are suggesting collusion - that an average\r\n\r\ncompany  would rush around to buy back its shares  without  good\r\n\r\nreasons.  It could be either because it has got more money  than\r\n\r\nit  knows what to do with, and therefore it is better to  return\r\n\r\npart of these to shareholders who may then wish to re-invest  in\r\n\r\nother things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned as to whether there are\r\n\r\nadequate safeguards to ensure that the company insiders  do  not\r\n\r\nmanipulate for personal advantage.  Unlike some countries  which\r\n\r\ndo  not  impose  limits on the number of  shares  which  can  be\r\n\r\nrepurchased  each  time,  we  have  imposed  a  rule  that  such\r\n\r\npurchases  should be limited to 10% of share capital.   The  10%\r\n\r\nlimit for share repurchase will minimise the potential and scope\r\n\r\nfor  management  to manipulate benchmarks such as  earnings  per\r\n\r\nshare  and  the price earnings ratio.  If a company is  in  fact\r\n\r\nmaking  losses,  repurchasing the shares will  not  improve  its\r\n\r\nearnings  related  benchmarks.  And if a company is making  only\r\n\r\nmodest  profits,  a 10% share repurchase will  not  inflate  its\r\n\r\nearnings related benchmarks noticeably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other safeguard which we have introduced is to allow\r\n\r\nbuy   backs  only  to  be  made  out  of  distributable  profits\r\n\r\naccumulated  over  time.  It also requires  prior  shareholders'\r\n\r\napproval, and there is an insolvency test. I believe that  under\r\n\r\nthe  present rules, there are sufficient safeguards  to  prevent\r\n\r\nabuse.  Of  course,  in administering this particular  amendment\r\n\r\nover time and as we acquire more experience, there may be a case\r\n\r\nfor reviewing some of these rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that management may be\r\n\r\nspending more time in managing share prices than in managing the\r\n\r\nbusiness itself.  I can only comment that you cannot stop  this.\r\n\r\nWhether  you have a share buy back purchase scheme  or  not,  if\r\n\r\nmanagement is inclined to do this, they will do it anyway.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked whether there should be a cap. We\r\n\r\nhave in fact imposed a cap of 5% as in the UK, rather\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan follow the one-broker rule which is prevalent in the United\r\n\r\nStates.  This was decided on after consultations with the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  of  Singapore, the Association of Banks  and  the  Law\r\n\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned whether timing differences\r\n\r\nwill  disadvantage minority shareholders.  One way to avoid this\r\n\r\nis  to require that repurchased shares  be cancelled immediately\r\n\r\non purchase.  In addition, listed companies will  be required by\r\n\r\nthe  SES  listings  rules, which are yet to be  implemented,  to\r\n\r\ndisclose all details of these repurchases, including the  number\r\n\r\nof  shares  bought  and  the prices paid  before  the  start  of\r\n\r\ntrading on the following business day. Also, section 103 of  the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry Act prohibits the company's  directors  and\r\n\r\nother  insiders from dealing in the company's shares  when  they\r\n\r\nare  in  possession of price sensitive information.   This  will\r\n\r\nhelp  ensure  that insiders do not deal in the company's  shares\r\n\r\nwhen  they  have  privileged information such as  the  time  and\r\n\r\nnumber of shares to be purchased on any particular day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also asked whether there should not be a\r\n\r\ntime  bar  on  the distributable profits.  I think there  is  no\r\n\r\nreason to impose a time bar.  All the distributable profits  are\r\n\r\nin  fact  profits  which  the company  could  have  declared  as\r\n\r\ndividends.   So,  to  put  a  time  bar  on  it  does  not  seem\r\n\r\nreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She also asked whether there are tax implications. The\r\n\r\nrule  is that companies will be allowed to buy back shares  only\r\n\r\nout  of  distributable profits.  Therefore, consistent with  the\r\n\r\ncurrent practice of companies on the payment of dividends out of\r\n\r\ndistributable  profits, shares brought back out of distributable\r\n\r\nprofits  will  also  require franking under section  44  of  the\r\n\r\nIncome Tax Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also concern about the tax treatment of shares\r\n\r\nsold  on the open market when the seller of such shares may  not\r\n\r\nknow  the  tax  implications.  The  tax  rules  here  are  quite\r\n\r\ncomplicated.   But  the  basic principle  is  that  if  a  share\r\n\r\npurchase  is  done in the open market, then the  seller  of  the\r\n\r\nshares would have been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeemed  to  have  sold  the shares and it  is  a  capital  gain.\r\n\r\nWhereas if the shares are bought under a special arrangement  on\r\n\r\nan  equal  pro  rata  basis, it is deemed as equivalent  to  the\r\n\r\ndistribution of dividends and is therefore subject to tax.  IRAS\r\n\r\nwill be issuing tax rules on this shortly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min wanted to know why preference shares are\r\n\r\nnot  included  in  the share buy back scheme.   I  have  already\r\n\r\nexplained this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also wants to know whether the limit of 10% on each\r\n\r\nshare  buy back proposal can be reviewed from time to  time.   I\r\n\r\ncan  assure the House that this will be done.  What we  need  is\r\n\r\nsome working experience before we decide to make changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our proposed rules, companies must notify\r\n\r\nshareholders  of  the authority given to the  directors  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany for a share buy back exercise in which the maximum price\r\n\r\nto  be  paid  will have to be specified, including  the  maximum\r\n\r\nnumber  of  shares  which  can be  acquired.    The  reason  for\r\n\r\nimposing such a condition is a safeguard to ensure that minority\r\n\r\nshareholders' interests are protected.  It is not  possible  for\r\n\r\nGovernment  itself to determine what the rules  for  determining\r\n\r\nthe  maximum  price  should be, and this must  be  left  to  the\r\n\r\nshareholders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards risk of manipulation by directors in a situation\r\n\r\nwhere  the company runs the risk of becoming insolvent, I  think\r\n\r\nthe  penalties  imposed on such activity are sufficiently  penal\r\n\r\nfor  directors  not  to  want to engage in  such  practices.   A\r\n\r\ndirector or manager who approves a buy back scheme knowing  that\r\n\r\nthe  company will become insolvent as a result of the  buy  back\r\n\r\nwill  be  guilty of a criminal offence liable on  conviction  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  not  exceeding 12 months  or  a  maximum  fine  of\r\n\r\n$5,000.   In  addition, they will be personally  liable  to  the\r\n\r\ncreditors  of  the company to the extent by which  the  purchase\r\n\r\nconsideration exceeded the distributable profits.  I think these\r\n\r\nare sufficient deterrents to discourage such activity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked an extensive number of questions\r\n\r\non  matters of detail.  I will try to answer as many of them  as\r\n\r\npossible.  But before doing so, I would like to point  out  that\r\n\r\nthese amendments to the Companies Act are not comprehensive.  We\r\n\r\nare  engaged  in a massive exercise in which the  Companies  Act\r\n\r\nwill  be  amended over a series of occasions.  And what is  left\r\n\r\nundone on this occasion, we will have opportunity to review them\r\n\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has suggested in a general way that the return\r\n\r\nof  surplus capital to the shareholders may indicate a  weakness\r\n\r\non  the  part  of  management.  While  this  is,  of  course,  a\r\n\r\npossibility,  I  think  the  general experience  has  been  that\r\n\r\ncompanies  would  only buy back shares if they have  substantial\r\n\r\namounts  of  surplus  capital which they are  unable  to  deploy\r\n\r\neffectively.   And  shareholders and purchasers  of  shares  can\r\n\r\nquickly see through the intent of management if it is otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that the share buy back scheme\r\n\r\nwill increase the debt equity ratio of a company.  While this is\r\n\r\na  possibility, we have introduced a safeguard to allow only 10%\r\n\r\nto  be  purchased on each occasion.  For the time being, I think\r\n\r\nthis is an adequate safeguard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned that the share buy back may\r\n\r\ncreate problems, triggering off takeover provisions when the 25%\r\n\r\nlimit is inadvertently hit due to the share buy back process.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  inform the Member that the Securities  Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil  (SIC)  is  now  crafting some  rules  to  address  this\r\n\r\nparticular problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insider trading is also a question which has been raised.\r\n\r\nThe  prevention  of insider trading, we believe,  is  adequately\r\n\r\ncovered under section 103 of the Securities Industry Act  (SIA).\r\n\r\nThe  provision  prevents a company from trading in  shares  when\r\n\r\ntheir   directors  and  officers  are  in  possession  of  price\r\n\r\nsensitive  information  not yet disclosed  to  the  public.   By\r\n\r\nbuying back its shares prior to public disclosure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof such information, the company will obviously be in breach of\r\n\r\nthe SIA prevention of insider trading provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member is also concerned over the possibility of\r\n\r\ndirectors and managers buying back shares for their own purposes\r\n\r\nand therefore engaging in market manipulation.  I should like to\r\n\r\npoint  out that unscrupulous management could manipulate  shares\r\n\r\nin  other  ways without the buy back scheme.  However,  the  10%\r\n\r\nrule  which  we  have imposed will minimise  the  potential  for\r\n\r\nmanipulation   because   a  10%  share   repurchase   will   not\r\n\r\nsignificantly  affect  the share value of  the  company.   Also,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  limit  on the amount of shares which  it  can  buy\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  limited  to the distributable  profits  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to other provisions of the Act, the Member is\r\n\r\nalso  concerned that the provision of \"deemed interest\"  can  go\r\n\r\nbeyond one tier, in the case of a person having an interest in a\r\n\r\nshare  in which a body corporate has an interest in if the  body\r\n\r\ncorporate person is accustomed formally or informally to act  in\r\n\r\naccordance with the direction of the person concerned.  He  also\r\n\r\nwants to know whether the term \"controlling interest\" will spell\r\n\r\ndefinitional problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the hon. Member is right. It is precisely the\r\n\r\nintention  of  the provision to catch such situations.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase described by the Member, the application of deemed interest\r\n\r\ncan  go beyond one tier.  As for controlling interest, the  term\r\n\r\nhas long standing use in the Companies Act.  To my knowledge, it\r\n\r\nhas not encountered such problems in practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other matters of detail which the hon. Member has\r\n\r\nraised.   I  will  not answer them in detail but,  generally,  I\r\n\r\nwould say that any items he has raised which are of significance\r\n\r\nwill be taken care of in future amendments to the Act.  Again, I\r\n\r\nwould  reiterate that the proposed amendments to  the  Act  have\r\n\r\nbeen consulted extensively with the Corporate Finance Committee,\r\n\r\nthe  Association  of  Banks of Singapore,  the  Singapore  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange, the Law Society and other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninterested  parties.   So  it covers  most  areas  of  interest.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are bound to be gaps in detail which we will take\r\n\r\ncare of next time when we amend the Act again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive ordered to stand part of the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 5.

It makes two\r\n\r\namendments to the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers)\r\n\r\nAct (Cap 217). Their objectives are to simplify procedures under\r\n\r\nthe  Act  and avoid duplication of effort and risk of  conflicts\r\n\r\nbetween Parliament and the Courts.\r\n\r\nThe first amendment facilitates the recovery of fines imposed by\r\n\r\nParliament  in exercise of its penal jurisdiction.   The  second\r\n\r\namendment  improves procedures to allow Parliament to deal  more\r\n\r\nexpeditiously with contempt if one of its committees has already\r\n\r\ninvestigated into the matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Recovery of fines</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first amendment on recovery of fines.\r\n\r\nCurrently, section 23(2) of the Act provides that fines  imposed\r\n\r\nby  Parliament have to be sued for in a civil Court first before\r\n\r\nthey  could be recovered from the errant party.  This  procedure\r\n\r\nis  not  satisfactory as it wastes the Court's time  and  incurs\r\n\r\nunnecessary cost for the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 23 of the Act does not define the role which the\r\n\r\nCourt  should play in presiding over a suit to recover the fines\r\n\r\nas a civil debt.  If the Court's role is merely to formalise the\r\n\r\nfine   imposed  by  Parliament  into  a  judgement,  it  is   an\r\n\r\nunnecessary duplication of work.  If it enables the person fined\r\n\r\nto contest the legality of the fine, it would amount to allowing\r\n\r\nthe  Court  to  overrule the decision of  Parliament.   The  law\r\n\r\nshould  avoid any possible conflict between Parliament  and  the\r\n\r\nCourts.   For this reason, our Courts have held that  Parliament\r\n\r\nhas  the  right to control its own proceedings and regulate  its\r\n\r\nown internal affairs without interference from the Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 23 of the Act to make\r\n\r\nany  fine imposed by Parliament recoverable as though  it  is  a\r\n\r\njudgement debt due to the Government, that is to say, a  sum  of\r\n\r\nmoney ordered by a Court as payable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the amendment, it would no longer be necessary to\r\n\r\nfirst sue for the fine before recovering it.  Writs of execution\r\n\r\nas  well as bankruptcy proceedings may immediately be instituted\r\n\r\nif the offender\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfails  to pay up the fine imposed by Parliament by the due date.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment  would facilitate the recovery of  fines  by  the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General on behalf of the State.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Contempt</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the second amendment on contempt. Currently,\r\n\r\nunder  section  21(1)  and  (2) of the  Parliament  (Privileges,\r\n\r\nImmunities  and Powers) Act, Parliament can deal with  incidents\r\n\r\nof contempt in the following ways:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) deal summarily with the offender;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) refer the matter to a Select Committee for investigation and\r\n\r\nreport;  or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) refer the matter to the Attorney-General with a view to\r\n\r\ninstituting criminal proceedings against the person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the matter is referred to a Select Committee,\r\n\r\nParliament on receiving the Select Committee's report,  has  the\r\n\r\nfurther  option  of either dealing with the offender  itself  or\r\n\r\nreferring  the  matter to the Attorney-General with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option to refer the matter to the Attorney-General with\r\n\r\na  view  to  prosecution in Court after a Select  Committee  has\r\n\r\ndealt with it is unnecessary.  It has no discernible benefit and\r\n\r\nonly lengthens the process.  Parliament already has the power to\r\n\r\npunish for contempt.  This is a proper exercise of parliamentary\r\n\r\nauthority.  The punishments are set out in the Act.  This option\r\n\r\nis  also circuitous as Parliament could have in the first  place\r\n\r\nreferred  the  matter to the Attorney-General instead  of  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee.   It  is  better  for  Parliament  to   deal\r\n\r\nexpeditiously  with  the  matter  after  the  Select   Committee\r\n\r\nproduces its Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The option could also result in uneasy relations between\r\n\r\nParliament  and the Judiciary.  This arises when the  matter  is\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the  Attorney-General with a view  to  prosecution\r\n\r\nafter a Select Committee has already investigated into\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  matter. Police investigations would have to be carried  out\r\n\r\nafresh.  There could be the possibility that, at the end of  the\r\n\r\nday,  the  Courts may rule that no offence of contempt has  been\r\n\r\ncommitted  despite Parliament's decision to send the  matter  to\r\n\r\nthe  Attorney-General with a view to prosecution.  The principle\r\n\r\nthat  any  possible conflict between the Courts  and  Parliament\r\n\r\nshould  be avoided is applicable here.  As I have said  earlier,\r\n\r\nour  Courts  have held that Parliament has the right to  control\r\n\r\nits  own  proceedings and regulate its internal affairs  without\r\n\r\ninterference from the Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the rationale for referring cases to the\r\n\r\nAttorney-General  with  a  view  to  prosecution  is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrelevant.  This bifurcated procedure was introduced in 1962 when\r\n\r\nParliament  was  then  expressly  prohibited  by  the  Act  from\r\n\r\nexercising  powers  of committal, ie, imprisonment.   Also,  the\r\n\r\npenalties that the Courts could mete out for offences under  the\r\n\r\nAct  were then much higher.  It was therefore necessary then  to\r\n\r\nretain  an  avenue  to the Courts so that the  higher  penalties\r\n\r\ncould  be  handed down by the Courts in appropriately bad  cases\r\n\r\ninvolving  contempt based on the Select Committee's Report.   In\r\n\r\n1986,  the Act was amended to confer on Parliament the power  to\r\n\r\ncommit  persons  for contempt and to fine them  up  to  $50,000.\r\n\r\nWith  these  enhanced  powers to deal with contempt,  Parliament\r\n\r\nwould no longer need to refer such cases for prosecution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 21 of the Act to remove\r\n\r\nthe option of referring a complaint of contempt to the Attorney-General  for prosecution if that complaint has already been  the\r\n\r\nsubject of investigation by a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments would, however, not remove from Parliament\r\n\r\nthe  power  to  refer a matter directly to the  Attorney-General\r\n\r\nwith   a  view  to  prosecution  where  it  is  considered  more\r\n\r\nappropriate for the offender to be dealt with by the Courts.\r\n\r\nSir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the privileges of debate in this House\r\n\r\nagainst defamation and other proceedings in court are well known\r\n\r\nand  enjoyed  by  Members here.  This is very important  because\r\n\r\nthis  Chamber should be open to all ideas, free of the  chilling\r\n\r\neffect  of  possible legal suit.  Less well-known, Sir,  is  the\r\n\r\nfact that these privileges are extended in a qualified manner to\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public, ordinary citizens, who choose  to  speak\r\n\r\nbefore our Select Committees.  This is confirmed by the case  of\r\n\r\nSivadas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present amendments now try to reconcile, as the\r\n\r\nMinister has said, a possible clash between the courts,  on  the\r\n\r\none  hand,  and  this House, on the other.   I  think  that,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, this is correct.  As far as Members of Parliament go,\r\n\r\nI  have  no  objections.  We, as Members of Parliament,  whether\r\n\r\nelected,  nominated, NCMPs, should know the rules.   My  concern\r\n\r\nrelates more to non-MPs, non-Members of the House, who choose to\r\n\r\ncome  before  the  House  to provide  their  opinion  in  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee affairs.  In such cases, if the House should choose to\r\n\r\ndecide to cite such persons for contempt, Parliament would be in\r\n\r\neffect  a  judge  in  its  own cause.  The  hearings  would  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily be public and this House, if I may say,  is  clearly\r\n\r\nnumerically dominated by one party.  For such people, members of\r\n\r\nthe  public, I think we have to ask ourselves whether they  know\r\n\r\nthe kind of possibilities that face them when they come before a\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  I do not, of course, mean that  they  should\r\n\r\nshy  away  from  doing  their citizens'  duties.   But  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage the Minister, in moving this amendment, to follow this\r\n\r\nup  with  the  assistance  of  the  Speaker  in  providing  more\r\n\r\ninformation to those who come before Select Committees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question then comes off: would these members\r\n\r\nof the public be better off being judged by the courts?  I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  not necessarily the case because the court itself,  as\r\n\r\nthe Minister has said, has decided that this House should be the\r\n\r\njudge  of its own proceedings, its own internal affairs.  But  I\r\n\r\nwould caution the House in reaching this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconclusion, the decision of the court related to a Member of\r\n\r\nParliament, and not a member of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards members of the public who come before this House\r\n\r\nand  might  commit contempt and might therefore  be  subject  to\r\n\r\nproceedings by this House, I would encourage this House  to  be,\r\n\r\nfirst,  judicious and sparing in the use of its powers  when  we\r\n\r\nclose  off the possible avenue of using the courts and,  second,\r\n\r\nliberal  in recognising the right of ordinary citizens to  speak\r\n\r\nand  give  their  opinions  before  this  House  in  its  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  meetings, even if it disagrees with  the  sentiments,\r\n\r\nprovided  of course that such sentiments do not amount to  gross\r\n\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Tay is\r\n\r\nconcerned  about strangers coming before a Select Committee  and\r\n\r\nnot  knowing the rules on how to conduct themselves and  whether\r\n\r\nthe  freedom  to  speak before a Committee is being  conscribed,\r\n\r\njust because they do not know the rules.  Let me assure him that\r\n\r\nhe need not have such worry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, when the Clerk of Parliament advertises\r\n\r\nin the press asking for submissions, he has already warned would-be  representors  that they should not publish any  evidence  or\r\n\r\ndocuments  they  have given to the Select Committee  before  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee finalises its report.  That is in one  of  the\r\n\r\nparagraphs in the advertisement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a person comes before a Select Committee, we treat him\r\n\r\nvery  gently, kindly and considerately.  We do not brow beat  or\r\n\r\nshout  at  him.  We treat him like any member of the public  who\r\n\r\nwants  to give his views to us and we welcome his views.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly  when  he has started to wander around and not  follow  the\r\n\r\nrules  that  the Speaker would definitely try to put the  person\r\n\r\nback  and say, \"Look, that is not the way to do things.   Please\r\n\r\nlet  me  give you some advice.  Do not stray beyond  the  point.\r\n\r\nTell us the truth and be honest about it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members remember the case of Dr Chee Soon Juan, in one\r\n\r\nof  our  Select Committee hearings, he talked about health  care\r\n\r\ncosts  and presented papers and data.   Eventually, that  matter\r\n\r\nled  to  a complaint to the Committee of Priviledges.   Even  at\r\n\r\nthat  Committee of Privileges, he was given a lot of  leeway  by\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman of the Committee.  But in the end, he  decided  to\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with  his  way and resulted  in  him  and  his  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues being fined by Parliament for committing perjury  and\r\n\r\nfabrication of data, etc.  So anyone who comes before  a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee, we will be very kind to him.  We will guide  him  and\r\n\r\nthe  Chairman  would give him a lot of leeway  before  he  makes\r\n\r\nfurther mistakes. So we need not worry about strangers not being\r\n\r\nable to speak freely before a Select Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, whatever evidence they give to a Select\r\n\r\nCommittee is also protected by the privileges of the Act, and in\r\n\r\nthe  case of Sivadas, as Mr Tay mentioned, he wrote a submission\r\n\r\nto the Select Committee on the Companies (Amendment) Bill and he\r\n\r\nmade many comments.  As a result, some people took him to court.\r\n\r\nHe  finally petitioned to the Petitions Committee which  decided\r\n\r\nto leave it to the Court.  The Court decided that his submission\r\n\r\nis  protected under the privileges of the Act and therefore  the\r\n\r\nplaintiff lost the case.  So the public can be rest assured that\r\n\r\nif  they speak up, they should not fear that their views will be\r\n\r\nconscribed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second\r\n\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment of Foreign Workers (Amendment) Bill before\r\n\r\nthe House today seeks to amend the Employment of Foreign Workers\r\n\r\nAct   to   provide  for  the  taking  and  recording  of  finger\r\n\r\nimpressions of foreign workers working in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the onset of the current economic downturn, there has\r\n\r\nbeen  increasing incidence of illegal employment.  For the first\r\n\r\neight  months  of  this  year, more than 2,000  foreigners  were\r\n\r\ncaught  working illegally without valid work permits.   This  is\r\n\r\nmore  than  twice the number of such cases for the corresponding\r\n\r\nperiod  last year.  Furthermore, an increasing number of illegal\r\n\r\nworkers  were found to be immigration offenders.  In  fact,  for\r\n\r\nthe first eight months of this year, 50% of illegal workers were\r\n\r\nalso  immigration  offenders  compared  to  only  16%  for   the\r\n\r\ncorresponding period last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Work Permit Department has also detected an increasing\r\n\r\nnumber  of  cases of forgeries of the work permit  card  itself.\r\n\r\nSince  April  1998,  the  number of  forged  work  permit  cards\r\n\r\ndetected by the Department has averaged about 40 to 50 a  month.\r\n\r\nThis  is  significantly higher than in the past  when  very  few\r\n\r\ncases  of forged work permit cards were detected.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nforged  work  permit  cards came from the  construction  sector.\r\n\r\nThey were work permit cards for foreign construction workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is not helped by the fact that many foreign\r\n\r\nworkers do not carry their original work permit cards with them.\r\n\r\nInstead,  they carry with them photocopies of the  card  as  the\r\n\r\noriginals  are  very  often  kept  by  their  employers.   These\r\n\r\nphotocopies  of  the work permit cards are very  often  of  poor\r\n\r\nquality and can also easily be forged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing number of illegal workers and rising\r\n\r\nincidences  of  forged  work  permit  cards  has  made  it  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  enforcement officers  to  identify  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  The current system for identifying foreign workers has\r\n\r\ntwo  shortcomings.  Firstly, existing security features  on  the\r\n\r\nwork  permit  cards themselves are outdated and make  the  cards\r\n\r\neasier to forge.  Secondly, the finger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpressions or fingerprints of the work permit holders  are  not\r\n\r\ncaptured  on  the  card,  making it  difficult  for  enforcement\r\n\r\nofficers  to conclusively identify the person holding the  card.\r\n\r\nClearly, we need to make the present identification system  more\r\n\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to deal with this problem, the Minister for Home Affairs\r\n\r\nhad  already  amended the Immigration Act on 4th September  this\r\n\r\nyear  to  provide  for  the  taking of  fingerprints  or  finger\r\n\r\nimpressions  from foreign workers in Singapore.   The  amendment\r\n\r\nbefore the House today is to enable my Ministry, the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower, to work together with the Ministry of Home Affairs  to\r\n\r\njointly implement a new and more secure identification card  for\r\n\r\nforeign workers.  This card will combine the current work permit\r\n\r\ncard,  the  Immigration  Disembarkation  and  Embarkation   card\r\n\r\ntogether  with  the Visit pass into one single card  which  will\r\n\r\nalso  carry  the fingerprint record of the foreign worker.   The\r\n\r\nnew  card will incorporate more security features to reduce  the\r\n\r\nlikelihood of forgeries.  These security features will  also  be\r\n\r\nmore   up-to-date   and  more  effective.   The   inclusion   of\r\n\r\nfingerprint  records  will  allow our  enforcement  agencies  to\r\n\r\nconclusively identify the holder of the work permit as being the\r\n\r\nperson who is authorised to enter Singapore to work.  It is also\r\n\r\nour  intention to make it mandatory for all foreign  workers  to\r\n\r\ncarry  the  new identification card with them at all  times,  so\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  are stopped for checking at the  worksite,  they\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to produce the original work permit card  rather\r\n\r\nthan a photocopy of the work permit card.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new identification card will be introduced from early next\r\n\r\nyear,  1999.   A phased approach will be adopted to capture  the\r\n\r\nfingerprints or finger impressions of all foreign workers.   For\r\n\r\na  start,  all new foreign workers will be required  to  provide\r\n\r\ntheir  finger  impressions  before they  are  issued  with  work\r\n\r\npermits to work in Singapore.  Existing foreign workers who  are\r\n\r\nalready here, who are holding the old work permit cards, will be\r\n\r\nasked to provide their finger impressions when they come up  for\r\n\r\nrenewal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we will pay particular attention to the recording\r\n\r\nof the finger impressions of foreign construction workers.  This\r\n\r\nis because cases of illegal employment and work permit forgeries\r\n\r\nare  most  rampant in the construction sector.  The construction\r\n\r\nsector   is  also  the  largest  employer  of  foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly  those from the non-traditional sources.   Existing\r\n\r\nforeign  construction  workers will be notified  to  have  their\r\n\r\nfinger  impressions taken within one year of  implementation  of\r\n\r\nthe  new  identification system, and it will take us  about  two\r\n\r\nyears  to  complete  the exercise.  But we  will  focus  on  the\r\n\r\nforeign  construction workers first, so that  we  get  them  all\r\n\r\nfingerprinted within the first year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new identification card for foreign workers will be issued\r\n\r\nfree-of-charge to the workers, in the first instance.  Employers\r\n\r\nwill  be advised on the procedures to obtain these new cards  in\r\n\r\ndue course.  However, if the foreign worker should lose the work\r\n\r\npermit  card or damage it or deface it in some way  and  need  a\r\n\r\nreplacement card,  a replacement fee of $20 will be charged.\r\n\r\nForeign workers are currently given up to 14 days to report  the\r\n\r\nloss  of  a work permit card to the Controller of Work  Permits.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the new identification card for foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, we intend to shorten this reporting period from 14 days\r\n\r\nto  7 days.   This will narrow the window period during which  a\r\n\r\nforeign worker cannot be conclusively identified because he  has\r\n\r\nnot got the card and there is difficulty identifying him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now go through the key clauses of this Bill. Clause\r\n\r\n2  of  the  Bill amends section 3 of the Employment  of  Foreign\r\n\r\nWorkers  Act to allow the Minister to appoint Deputy Controllers\r\n\r\nof  Work  Permits and Assistant Controllers of Work  Permits  to\r\n\r\nassist  the  Controller  to  carry  out  the  functions  of  the\r\n\r\nController  under the Act.  This is necessary  to  expedite  the\r\n\r\nmanagement of a very large number of foreign workers present  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  at  any one time.  Today, we have more  than  450,000\r\n\r\nforeign  workers in Singapore.  So we need to have more officers\r\n\r\nwho are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nempowered  to  deal  with all the management matters  concerning\r\n\r\nforeign workers in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 14 to reduce the time within which a\r\n\r\nforeign  worker must report the loss, destruction or  defacement\r\n\r\nof a work permit from 14 days to 7 days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 29 of the Act\r\n\r\nto  extend  the  powers of the Minister to make  Regulations  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the taking and recording of finger impressions  of\r\n\r\npersons who have applied for or who have been issued with a work\r\n\r\npermit  and for the dissemination of such records to the  Police\r\n\r\nand other law enforcement agencies.  These regulations will also\r\n\r\nempower  law  enforcement agencies to demand finger  impressions\r\n\r\nfrom  persons  holding  the work permit  cards  for  purpose  of\r\n\r\nverification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nin  support  of  the  proposed amendment in  the  Employment  of\r\n\r\nForeign   Workers  (Amendment)  Bill  aimed  at  improving   the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond what the Minister for Manpower has just described,\r\n\r\nthe  primary purpose of the amendment Bill is to give the  power\r\n\r\nto  effectively address the issue of fraud and forgeries of work\r\n\r\npermit cards.  The proposed amendment to section 3 to also allow\r\n\r\nthe   Minister  for  Manpower  to  appoint  additional  manpower\r\n\r\nresources  to  assist the Controller is timely to ensure,  among\r\n\r\nothers,  that  we screen, filter and subsequently admit  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  with  the  necessary  skills  and  calibre  so  as   to\r\n\r\ncontribute to the enhancement of Singapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the light of the current financial crisis, much concern\r\n\r\nhas  been  raised  about  the extent of jobs  being  assumed  by\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.   With  rising  unemployment,  this  cry  will\r\n\r\ninevitably get\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlouder.   The fact is, with the limited pool of trained workers,\r\n\r\nSingapore will still have to depend on foreign workers  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe needs of increasingly more sophisticated industries.  It  is\r\n\r\ntherefore imperative for the Ministry of Manpower to ensure  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  labour demand to be closely matched just in  numbers,\r\n\r\nbut,  more importantly, to make available trained manpower  with\r\n\r\nthe   requisite  knowledge  and  skills  demanded   by   today's\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Manpower has recently announced in Parliament\r\n\r\nthat  the  National Plan for Manpower is being  drawn  up  by  a\r\n\r\nManpower  21  Committee  comprising captains  of  industry,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and  the  trade  unions.   This  multi-agency   and\r\n\r\ntripartite  approach  to manpower planning  and  development  is\r\n\r\nlaudable  to  ensure that the needs of different industries  are\r\n\r\nappropriately  met.   In situations where  foreign  workers  are\r\n\r\nneeded to fill the gap, it is imperative to make sure that  only\r\n\r\nforeigners with the requisite skills and talents are brought  in\r\n\r\nto  fill  appropriate job vacancies.  This should be  done  only\r\n\r\nafter  exhaustively  checking  and  ensuring  that  no  suitable\r\n\r\nunemployed  Singaporeans  could  take  on  the  jobs.   Such  an\r\n\r\napproach will lend credibility and comfort to existing  and  new\r\n\r\ncompanies  for  they are assured of being able  to  continue  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  workers  with the appropriate skills and  abilities  to\r\n\r\nenable   them   to   operate  efficiently  and  increase   their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporean workers will also look up to their foreign\r\n\r\ncounterparts to learn new skills from them rather than  shunning\r\n\r\nthem.   In  the current tough economic environment, new  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  admitted  must be seen to add value  to  the  companies\r\n\r\nrecruiting   them  and  ultimately  contribute  to   Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic competitiveness.  During these difficult times, it  can\r\n\r\nbe  expected that Singaporean workers will be more vigilant than\r\n\r\never  of the quality of foreign workers brought in by companies.\r\n\r\nThey  must  be  able to demonstrate their special  abilities  in\r\n\r\norder to earn the respect of their Singaporean counterparts  and\r\n\r\npreferably should be in a position to impart their knowledge and\r\n\r\nskills to our workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the amendment of sections 14 and 29, I think\r\n\r\nthese  amendments are essential to highlight to foreign  workers\r\n\r\nthat  the  work  permit issued to them is an important  document\r\n\r\nwhich  must  be properly protected and also to deter  them  from\r\n\r\ntoying  with the idea of making a quick buck from selling  their\r\n\r\nwork  permit  card which undoubtedly is in demand  by  potential\r\n\r\nimposters in the light of the current economic crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, generally I support the Bill as it aims to provide\r\n\r\nfor  better  administration of the Act.  However,  I  have  some\r\n\r\nreservations regarding the amendment to provide for  the  taking\r\n\r\nand recording of fingerprints of persons issued with work permit\r\n\r\nand  for the records to be given to the Police.  I must say that\r\n\r\nthe  Minister has been persuasive and convincing of the need and\r\n\r\nnecessity for fingerprinting of work permit holders and that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  made simply on the connotation or prejudice  that  work\r\n\r\npermit  holders are more predisposed to crime and that they  are\r\n\r\nharder to track down because of their sheer numbers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to bring up a point that there appears to\r\n\r\nbe  unequal treatment of employment pass holders and work permit\r\n\r\nholders.   Yet one can argue that while we have not seen  crimes\r\n\r\ncommitted by those with employment pass, some that we have  seen\r\n\r\nhave  caused serious financial consequences.  Arguably,  we  can\r\n\r\nalso say they are more mobile and more difficult to track.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is understandable that based on the explanation given\r\n\r\nby the Minister that the employment pass holders have not caused\r\n\r\nthe kind of problems that we are faced with, with regard to work\r\n\r\npermit holders, it is necessary that we demonstrate equality  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  the sense that I would think it is  necessary  at\r\n\r\nthis point perhaps to even consider fingerprinting all employees\r\n\r\nwho want to work in Singapore.  After all, Singaporeans are also\r\n\r\nfingerprinted as far as their identity cards are  concerned.   I\r\n\r\nam simply raising\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis  point  because  we  must  be careful  of  the  problematic\r\n\r\nperception  that  they may cause and generate,  that  while  the\r\n\r\neffect of such a regulation may be unequal for good reasons, the\r\n\r\nobjective is certainly not discriminatory.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I first want to\r\n\r\nthank both Members for speaking in support of the amendment Bill\r\n\r\nalthough they have some reservations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the point raised by Mr Ahmad Magad. His main\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  foreign workers who are allowed into  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  be the ones who can do the job that is expected of  them\r\n\r\nso  that  they  can make a contribution to the company  and  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  Let me assure Mr Magad that this is the case and  that\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  come to Singapore, either the skilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  who  hold employment pass, or the semi-skilled  workers\r\n\r\nwho hold work permits, or even the unskilled foreign workers who\r\n\r\nhold a two-year work permit, because the employers require their\r\n\r\nservices  and  they  can  help  the  company  to  enhance  their\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge.   It must be so because  employers  will  not\r\n\r\nbring in these foreign workers just to stack up the manpower  or\r\n\r\nthe  headcount in the company.  They need these foreign  workers\r\n\r\nbecause, in many instances, Singaporeans are not prepared to  do\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  jobs  which  are available.   As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\nemployers have no option but to turn to foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give Members the example in the construction sector.\r\n\r\nToday,  we  have a large number of foreign construction  workers\r\n\r\nbecause  many  Singaporeans are not  prepared  to  work  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector, although there are many jobs going  begging\r\n\r\nwithin the construction sector. Employers or contractors recruit\r\n\r\nmany  foreign workers.  In the construction sector, my  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  introducing  new  regulations to  ensure  that  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers who come in have some basic construction skills. We have\r\n\r\nstarted in August this year to require all recruitments of  non-traditional source construction workers to have at least 20%  of\r\n\r\nthem  tested  in  basic skills in their home country  before  we\r\n\r\ngrant  approval in Singapore.  In other words, if  you  want  to\r\n\r\nbring in 100\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  workers from Bangladesh, for instance, at least  20  of\r\n\r\nthem must have been skill tested in Bangladesh itself first  and\r\n\r\nthey   have  been  found  to  have  a  certain  level  of  basic\r\n\r\nconstruction skill before we grant approval in principle for you\r\n\r\nto  bring  in  100  of  these workers.   This  20%  figure  will\r\n\r\ngradually  be adjusted upwards to 100%.  Our initial target  was\r\n\r\nto  do this over a period of three years, but we are looking  at\r\n\r\nwhether  we can shorten this period and to speed up the  process\r\n\r\nto force the contractors to recruit more skilled workers.  There\r\n\r\nis likelihood that we can shorten the timeframe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same can be said for many other sectors where, under the\r\n\r\npresent circumstances, employers in fact have an opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  more skilled workers because in the regional  countries\r\n\r\naffected  by  the  Asian crisis, there is massive  unemployment.\r\n\r\nThere is opportunity for them now to go out to look for the more\r\n\r\nskilled workers to come in to supplement the Singapore workforce\r\n\r\nin areas where we are lacking.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to refine and improve our foreign worker\r\n\r\npolicy  to  ensure that employers who bring in  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwill need them and they have suitable skills qualification. This\r\n\r\nwill  take some time because we have a large pool of quite lowly\r\n\r\nskilled  foreign  workers.   This has  got  to  be  turned  over\r\n\r\ngradually  and,  in due course, we can replace  them  with  more\r\n\r\nskilled foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I now turn to Mr Zulkifli who also supported the\r\n\r\nidea  in  the Bill to fingerprint the foreign workers.   But  he\r\n\r\nasked  why  is  there this unequal treatment between  employment\r\n\r\npass  holders and work permit holders. The reason, as the Member\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned,  is that today the problems of  abuses  such  as\r\n\r\nforgery  of work permit card or work passes or working illegally\r\n\r\nexist  mainly in the unskilled and semi-skilled level, in  other\r\n\r\nwords,  work permit holder level. There are very few  employment\r\n\r\npass  holders,  who  are  in  the professional,  management  and\r\n\r\nexecutive   level,  who  end  up  in  this  kind  of  situation.\r\n\r\nForgeries or infringements of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe employment pass regulation in the employment pass sector are\r\n\r\nvery  few,  because  these are the better qualified  and  higher\r\n\r\nskilled  people.   We  do not have so many cases  of  abuses  or\r\n\r\nillegal  workers or professionals coming into Singapore to  work\r\n\r\nillegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main problem is with the two-year work permit holders\r\n\r\nwho are mostly unskilled workers, and the bulk of the problem is\r\n\r\nactually  in the construction sector.  We have lots  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the marine, manufacturing and service sectors.   We\r\n\r\nhave  very few problems with these people.  Most of the problems\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  encountering  such as illegal  workers,  wrongful\r\n\r\ndeployment and abandoning workers on the street, all  come  from\r\n\r\nthe construction sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this amendment, we will concentrate all our resources\r\n\r\nto  ensure that fingerprinting of the construction workers takes\r\n\r\npriority.  We will try to do it within one year because we  must\r\n\r\ntackle  this most serious problem first.  If, at some  point  in\r\n\r\nthe  future, we find out that employment pass holders are up  to\r\n\r\nno  good  and are also committing all kinds of breaches  of  the\r\n\r\nemployment pass regulations, we can also bring them in.  We only\r\n\r\ndo  things like fingerprinting if it is necessary.  If there  is\r\n\r\nno need to do it, why do we want to go through the trouble?  Let\r\n\r\nme  assure him that this is not a case of discrimination.   This\r\n\r\nis  a case of doing what is necessary.  There is no need for  us\r\n\r\nto overdo it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee\r\n\r\nof the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the\r\n\r\nBill. - [Dr Lee Boon Yang].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment, read a\r\n\r\nThird time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be fixed.\" - [Mr\r\n\r\nWong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty Minutes to Seven o'clock pm</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">to a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>ANSWERED BY 1.30 PM</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>USE OF MALAYSIAN AIRSPACE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence how the Malaysian Government's decision  to\r\n\r\nterminate  various arrangements governing the use  of  Malaysian\r\n\r\nairspace  by  the  Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF)  will\r\n\r\naffect  RSAF training and operations and Search and Rescue,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  measures  were  taken up by the RSAF  to  deal  with  this\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister for Defence, with the restrictions imposed on the usage\r\n\r\nof Malaysian airspace, what measures are being considered by the\r\n\r\nSAF  to  (i)  work around the restrictions; and (ii) improve  on\r\n\r\ntheir search-and-rescue operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th September, Malaysia informed the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  terminating various agreements  and  arrangements\r\n\r\ngoverning  the RSAF's use of Malaysian airspace. Their  decision\r\n\r\ncame  into effect on 18th September, effectively giving us  less\r\n\r\nthan  24  hours'  notice.   This was a  unilateral  decision  by\r\n\r\nMalaysia. We were not given prior notification nor consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's decision affected the agreements and arrangements\r\n\r\ncovering RSAF flights through South Johor to the South China Sea\r\n\r\nTraining Area; RSAF training within Malaysia's Low Flying  Area;\r\n\r\nRSAF  navigational  training  flights  in  Peninsular  and  East\r\n\r\nMalaysia;  RSAF aircraft taking off from Tengah Air  Base  using\r\n\r\nSouth  Johor airspace; and combined Search and Rescue operations\r\n\r\nand exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF and the SAF plan for all contingencies, and Malaysia's\r\n\r\ndecision  has not curtailed the RSAF's training and  operations.\r\n\r\nWhen the decision was conveyed, the RSAF immediately implemented\r\n\r\nalternative arrangements.  Today the RSAF conducts its  training\r\n\r\nand  operational flights with the same frequency  and  tempo  as\r\n\r\nbefore.   RSAF  aircraft proceeding to their training  areas  no\r\n\r\nlonger  transit through Malaysian airspace but take  alternative\r\n\r\nroutes.   In  doing so, we have not compromised on safety.   The\r\n\r\nRSAF  has  been working closely with CAAS to ensure  the  proper\r\n\r\nsequencing  of RSAF flights and civil air traffic  so  that  air\r\n\r\nsafety is not compromised. We have also minimised the number  of\r\n\r\nRSAF  flights over built-up areas.  However, the adjustments  in\r\n\r\nflight  paths could mean some inconvenience to those  living  on\r\n\r\nboth sides of the Johor Straits as more aircraft now have to fly\r\n\r\nover  Singapore's territorial waters in the Straits.   In  fact,\r\n\r\nseveral  of the arrangements which Malaysia terminated had  been\r\n\r\ndesigned to reduce the aircraft noise level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The RSAF does not depend on any one country for its training\r\n\r\nneeds.  The  RSAF  has established extensive  overseas  training\r\n\r\narrangements.  These have provided valuable training  areas  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  opportunity to train and exercise with  other  highly\r\n\r\nprofessional  air  forces.  We will continue  to  look  for  new\r\n\r\ntraining areas in other parts of the world. In addition, we have\r\n\r\ninvested  heavily  in  advanced training  simulators.   We  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  conduct more sophisticated training and  exercises\r\n\r\nand  make  more extensive use of simulators, to ensure that  the\r\n\r\nRSAF's operational and training effectiveness continues to be of\r\n\r\nthe highest standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINDEF would like to clarify some of the misconceptions about\r\n\r\nthe  agreements  and arrangements covered by Malaysia's  action.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the arrangements did not allow RSAF aircraft a free run\r\n\r\nof  Malaysian  airspace.   For safety  and  other  reasons,  the\r\n\r\narrangements set out minimum heights and demarcated areas, which\r\n\r\nwere strictly adhered to by the RSAF. The RSAF also ensured that\r\n\r\nits  aircraft  did  not  fly at certain times  because  we  were\r\n\r\nsensitive to noise concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, many of these arrangements were established many\r\n\r\nyears ago, with some dating back to the 1960s. As these are long-established bilateral arrangements, mutually agreed upon, we had\r\n\r\nexpected  some consultation or discussion before any action  was\r\n\r\ntaken.  Especially as over the years the Ministries  of  Defence\r\n\r\nand   air   forces  of  the  two  countries  have  had   regular\r\n\r\nconsultations, conducted professionally and for mutual  benefit,\r\n\r\nto  make adjustments to the arrangements when necessary so as to\r\n\r\ntake  into account such things as aircraft noise and congestion.\r\n\r\nInstead  the  decision was conveyed with  less  than  24  hours'\r\n\r\nnotice.  This is despite the fact that the terms of one  of  the\r\n\r\nagreements  clearly  provide for six  months'  notification  for\r\n\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, these agreements and arrangements were established in\r\n\r\ngood  faith and for mutual benefit. They were drawn up within  a\r\n\r\nspirit of cooperation and Malaysia also derived some benefits in\r\n\r\nexchange for the RSAF's use of their airspace.  For example, the\r\n\r\nRMAF  was  given access to RSAF Operational Flight Trainers  and\r\n\r\nAir  Combat Simulator. The RMAF was also allowed to station  its\r\n\r\npersonnel at the RSAF's Joint Air Traffic Control Centre to help\r\n\r\ncoordination between the two air traffic control centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Malaysia's action has not affected the RSAF's training and\r\n\r\noperations, there will be an adverse effect on Search and Rescue\r\n\r\n(SAR)  operations, as we were unfortunately reminded of  only  a\r\n\r\nweek   after   Malaysia  cancelled  the  SAR  Agreement.    This\r\n\r\nagreement, which is a common one between countries, was based on\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  considerations to facilitate SAR  operations.   In\r\n\r\nsuch operations, time is of the essence.  How quickly distressed\r\n\r\npersonnel  can  be located and rescued can mean  the  difference\r\n\r\nbetween  life  and death. Usually, SAR aircraft  will  take  the\r\n\r\nshortest, most direct route to the search area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the agreement, the RSAF had in the past rescued both its\r\n\r\nown  pilots as well as Malaysian pilots.  For instance, in 1988,\r\n\r\nthe  RSAF  rendered assistance to the RMAF twice for Search  and\r\n\r\nRescue  and  Search and Locate efforts. In the  first  case,  we\r\n\r\nlocated the downed pilot at sea, picked him up and sent  him  to\r\n\r\nan  RMAF  airfield. In the second, we located the  survivor  and\r\n\r\ndirected  Malaysian search aircraft to his location.  We  worked\r\n\r\nhand-in-hand with the Malaysian authorities on both occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the British helicopter mishap, the Malaysian Defence\r\n\r\nMinister asked Singapore to notify Malaysia of planned exercises\r\n\r\nand  to  apply  for airspace clearance well beforehand  for  SAR\r\n\r\noperations during these exercises. SAR operations are  by  their\r\n\r\nvery  nature  meant  to handle emergencies which  by  definition\r\n\r\ncannot   be  anticipated.  And  emergencies  can  happen  during\r\n\r\ntraining  and even routine flights. Furthermore our  Air  Force,\r\n\r\nlike  the  Malaysian Air Force and other air forces,  carry  out\r\n\r\nflying  training  and  exercises  almost  daily.  That  is   why\r\n\r\ncountries have standing SAR arrangements, such as the one  which\r\n\r\nthe  RSAF  and RMAF had until 31/2 weeks ago. This is  the  most\r\n\r\npractical  arrangement,  meant  to  expedite  and  smoothen  the\r\n\r\noperations  and  procedures between both sides for  humanitarian\r\n\r\nreasons  in  order  to save lives in an emergency  when  SAR  is\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the most basic principles of Search and Rescue, which\r\n\r\nare  internationally accepted, are that there should be no delay\r\n\r\nin  search  and  rescue efforts; that states should  extend  any\r\n\r\npossible  assistance  to search and rescue  efforts;  and,  that\r\n\r\nstates  should  coordinate  their  search  and  rescue  efforts.\r\n\r\nSingapore's   approach  to  SAR  has  always   been   based   on\r\n\r\ninternationally-accepted  practices and  universal  humanitarian\r\n\r\nprinciples.   As  a  responsible  member  of  the  international\r\n\r\ncommunity,  we  will  continue to uphold  these  principles  and\r\n\r\npractices.  This means that we have and will meet the obligation\r\n\r\nto  provide  SAR  to  those in distress  in  the  quickest  time\r\n\r\npossible.  It  also means that we must continue to maintain  the\r\n\r\nhighest  readiness  for our SAR operations.  This  is  something\r\n\r\nwhich  we  cannot and will not compromise, for lives  -  whether\r\n\r\nSingaporean or other nationalities - are at stake. And  this  is\r\n\r\nwhy  the  RSAF's  SAR  assets will  continue  to  be  ready  for\r\n\r\ndeployment  at a moment's notice. However, while our SAR  assets\r\n\r\nmay  be  highly  trained and prepared for all contingencies,  we\r\n\r\nmust recognise that international cooperation is often necessary\r\n\r\nin  SAR  operations.  We  will continue to  coordinate  our  SAR\r\n\r\nefforts with\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneighbouring  states where necessary. We will also  continue  to\r\n\r\nrender  our utmost assistance to the SAR efforts of neighbouring\r\n\r\nstates, and we hope to get similar cooperation from them when we\r\n\r\nhave to conduct such humanitarian operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of the latest developments on the airspace issue,\r\n\r\nthere  have  also  been  various allegations  of  intrusions  by\r\n\r\nSingapore  aircraft into Malaysian territory.  Such  allegations\r\n\r\nare  not new. Only two weeks before the latest allegation on 1st\r\n\r\nOctober  by  Malaysia's  Minister of  Defence,  there  had  been\r\n\r\nreports  in  the  Malaysian press quoting allegations  by  Johor\r\n\r\nresidents of RSAF intrusions. Datuk Syed Hamid himself had  come\r\n\r\nout to say that there was no intrusion. He also pointed out that\r\n\r\nsuch  news  reports were provocative. We noted  and  we  welcome\r\n\r\nDatuk  Syed Hamid's statement that Malaysia and its Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence  would  not react on hearsay and allegations  but  would\r\n\r\ninvestigate the complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response to all allegations of intrusions by our aircraft\r\n\r\nand  vessels  has  always been a simple one. Inform  us  through\r\n\r\nofficial channels and give us the details so that we can conduct\r\n\r\na  thorough  investigation. If we find that  our  personnel  did\r\n\r\nintrude,  we  will  punish them for we regard  this  as  a  very\r\n\r\nserious matter. But if all we get is an outcry in the media with\r\n\r\nno  evidence provided, then we cannot be expected to pursue  the\r\n\r\nmatter further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that over the past five years there have been\r\n\r\ntwo  instances  (both  in  1996) when the  Malaysian  Government\r\n\r\nofficially  complained about RSAF intrusions. On the first  case\r\n\r\nof   an   alleged  RSAF  intrusion,  MINDEF  conducted  thorough\r\n\r\ninvestigations and found no evidence to support the claim of  an\r\n\r\nintrusion. We sought more information from Malaysia to  help  us\r\n\r\nwith  our  investigations, and we even offered  an  exchange  of\r\n\r\ninformation  but Malaysia did not respond. In the  second  case,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  sent  a TPN which set out seven alleged  instances  of\r\n\r\nintrusions. Our investigations showed that the claim was without\r\n\r\nbasis.  In two of the instances the aircraft concerned were  not\r\n\r\neven RSAF aircraft. There was another instance, early this year,\r\n\r\nwhen  the Malaysian Ministry of Defence made an informal request\r\n\r\nto MINDEF to check whether some RSAF F-5s had strayed from their\r\n\r\nflight  path  in  the  Low Flying Area.  They  provided  us  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  details.  We conducted a thorough  investigation  and\r\n\r\nfound  that  the  F-5s had unintentionally deviated  from  their\r\n\r\nplanned route due to weather and temporal disorientation of  the\r\n\r\nlead  pilot.  MINDEF  conveyed this and  our  apologies  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason whatsoever for the RSAF to intrude into\r\n\r\nMalaysian airspace. In fact, the RSAF had every reason to adhere\r\n\r\nstrictly  to the terms and conditions of the various  agreements\r\n\r\nwe  had with Malaysia for the use of Malaysian airspace, for  to\r\n\r\ndo  otherwise would have brought an immediate response from  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government. The Malaysian authorities would have  been\r\n\r\ncarefully  scrutinising RSAF flights in Malaysian  airspace  and\r\n\r\nwould  not  have  hesitated to produce  evidence  to  prove  any\r\n\r\ndeviation  from the agreements had any such deviation  occurred.\r\n\r\nThe  fact,  that  in  spite  of all the  allegations  and  close\r\n\r\nscrutiny  the detailed information which Singapore requested  to\r\n\r\ncarry out investigations was not forthcoming, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CUSTOMS, IMMIGRATION AND QUARANTINE (CIQ) ISSUE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs what is the status of negotiations  to  resolve\r\n\r\nthe  Customs,  Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) issue  with  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S.

However, this is not unusual  as\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries  have  had  bilateral  problems  in  the  past.\r\n\r\nFortunately,  ASEAN  members have not  allowed  their  bilateral\r\n\r\ndisputes  to  impede their ongoing cooperation or  to  undermine\r\n\r\nASEAN unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, notwithstanding the current problems besetting the\r\n\r\nregion  and  certain bilateral issues, ASEAN  Foreign  Ministers\r\n\r\nheld  a successful annual Ministerial Meeting in Manila in July.\r\n\r\nRecently,  on  23rd  September,  I  chaired  an  ASEAN   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters'  Meeting held in New York on the fringes  of  the  UN\r\n\r\nGeneral  Assembly,  during which the Foreign  Ministers  reached\r\n\r\nconsensus  on  a number of issues, including on  Cambodia.   The\r\n\r\nASEAN  Finance  Ministers met on 4th October 1998 in  Washington\r\n\r\nDC,  where they agreed to endorse the terms of understanding for\r\n\r\nan  ASEAN  Surveillance  Process.  A few  days  ago,  the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nEconomic Ministers also met in Manila to discuss cooperation  in\r\n\r\neconomic  matters.  These ASEAN Ministerial meetings demonstrate\r\n\r\nthat  notwithstanding  ongoing bilateral differences  and  other\r\n\r\ndifficulties, ASEAN member countries continue to cooperate on  a\r\n\r\nrange of important issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the regional financial and economic\r\n\r\ncrisis  poses one of the biggest challenges for ASEAN.  All  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries  have been affected, to varying  degrees.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge now is for ASEAN, during this period of difficulty, to\r\n\r\ncontinue  such cooperation at all levels to tackle the  problems\r\n\r\nfacing the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) On the second part of the Member's question, I wish to\r\n\r\ninform him that despite the financial and economic crisis, ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  have been moving ahead on the ASEAN Free Trade  Area,\r\n\r\nor  AFTA,  initiative.  At the recently-concluded  AFTA  Council\r\n\r\nMeeting  held  in  Manila on 6th October 1998,  ASEAN  countries\r\n\r\nreiterated their commitment to implement AFTA and further agreed\r\n\r\nto  expand  the  number of tariff lines that can be  accelerated\r\n\r\nahead  of  schedule.  Indeed the AFTA  Council  recognised  that\r\n\r\nfurther acceleration of AFTA was particularly important in light\r\n\r\nof   the   current  financial  and  economic  crisis.    ASEAN's\r\n\r\ncommitment  to  economic cooperation is further demonstrated  by\r\n\r\nthe  endorsement  of  the  ASEAN Economic  Ministers,  at  their\r\n\r\nmeeting  in  Manila from 7th-8th October 1998, of the  Framework\r\n\r\nAgreement on the ASEAN Investment Area to enhance the investment\r\n\r\nclimate in ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>STATUS OF FOREIGN RESERVES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will\r\n\r\nindicate  the  present  status of our  foreign  reserves  and  a\r\n\r\nsummary  of  the  resultant  effect on  them  arising  from  the\r\n\r\neconomic turmoil and currency crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothwithstanding the Asian economic crisis, and the turmoil\r\n\r\nin   world   financial   markets,  our  reserves   are   earning\r\n\r\nsatisfactory returns.

However, for a large number of  those\r\n\r\nretrenched,  many have still been able to secure  re-employment.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  MOM,  a healthy 63% of those  retrenched  in  1st\r\n\r\nQuarter 1998 managed to find a new job by the 2nd Quarter  1998.\r\n\r\nThe average time to secure the new job was 1.4 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most effective assistance Government can extend to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans during this difficult period is to help ensure that\r\n\r\nworkers stay employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help workers stay employed during this economic downturn,\r\n\r\nGovernment has adopted a 3-pronged approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will help to keep businesses viable so as to\r\n\r\nminimise  retrenchments.  In order to do this, we need  to  keep\r\n\r\nour  costs competitive so that our companies can compete for the\r\n\r\nreduced business demand during this period.  We will do this  by\r\n\r\nreducing our business costs.  The $2 billion Off-Budget  package\r\n\r\nannounced in June 1998 was part of this cost-cutting exercise to\r\n\r\npreserve  jobs.  Towards the end of this year, the Committee  on\r\n\r\nSingapore's Competitiveness will recommend to Government further\r\n\r\nmeasures to reduce business costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, the economic promotion agencies are stepping up\r\n\r\ntheir  investment promotion efforts.  This will help create  new\r\n\r\njobs  to  replace those lost.  EDB has recently  announced  that\r\n\r\n15,000  new  jobs  in electronic components, petrochemicals  and\r\n\r\naerospace  and  5,000  more  in  communications,  logistics  and\r\n\r\nheadquarter operations would need to be filled this year.  There\r\n\r\nis  therefore  no  shortage  of jobs available  if  our  workers\r\n\r\npossess the necessary skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we will help to train our Singaporean workers to acquire\r\n\r\nthe necessary skills to match the needs of companies. The Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP), which was launched  earlier  this\r\n\r\nyear  to  complement  the existing Skills Development  Fund,  is\r\n\r\naimed precisely at this. The SRP provides training that not only\r\n\r\nleads  to certifiable skills which employers recognise,  but  it\r\n\r\nalso  provides trained workers a job, either with their existing\r\n\r\nemployer  or new employer. As of September, about 2,200  workers\r\n\r\nhave   completed  training  and  another  2,400  are  undergoing\r\n\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we will help retrenched workers secure alternative\r\n\r\nemployment through active job-matching. The Ministry of Manpower\r\n\r\n(MOM)  has  implemented the Employment Assistance Programme  and\r\n\r\nalso  set  up a new Employment Facilitation Team to  source  and\r\n\r\npool job vacancies from companies so that retrenched workers can\r\n\r\nsecure employment expeditiously. These efforts have resulted  in\r\n\r\nmore  job  opportunities  being identified  for  the  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers.  To date, MOM has been able to provide job referrals to\r\n\r\nsome 80% of all job seekers every month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that despite these measures, there\r\n\r\nwill  still be some affected workers who will be unable to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  the economic downturn. For breadwinners who are retrenched\r\n\r\nand have no other resources to fall back on, they can turn to  a\r\n\r\nvariety of community assistance programmes available through the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Community  Development (MCD).   For  example,  the\r\n\r\nInterim  Financial Scheme, administered by MCD and the Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment   Councils  (CDC),  provides  short-term   financial\r\n\r\nassistance  to  help individuals and families  facing  financial\r\n\r\nhardship.   For those who are in need of longer-term assistance,\r\n\r\nseveral  other  specialised  assistance  schemes  are  available\r\n\r\nthrough MCD, CDCs, the National Council of Social Services,  and\r\n\r\nthe  various voluntary welfare organisations.  These include the\r\n\r\nPublic  Assistance Scheme, Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme,\r\n\r\nand the Centre-Based Financial Assistance for Childcare Scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT OF GOODS AND SERVICES TAX</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance if\r\n\r\nhis  Ministry  will assess the impact and effectiveness  of  the\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services  tax  in terms of  achieving  its  original\r\n\r\nobjectives  and consider a downward revision in the tax  by  two\r\n\r\npercentage points to stimulate demand and reduce business  costs\r\n\r\nin the light of the changing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GST was introduced in 1994 to achieve a better balance\r\n\r\nbetween direct and indirect taxes.  With its introduction,  both\r\n\r\ncorporate and personal income taxes were cut substantially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the 3% GST was intended to be revenue\r\n\r\nneutral.   Last  year, GST collection totalled  $1,927  million.\r\n\r\nWhereas  revenue forgone from the cut in income taxes and  other\r\n\r\noffsets  was $2,273 million, so that the original objective  was\r\n\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present economic downturn is due primarily to a fall in\r\n\r\nexternal  demand. As domestic demand accounts for less than  30%\r\n\r\nof  total demand, and the GST tax is only 3%, reducing  or  even\r\n\r\nsuspending   GST   altogether  will  not  raise   total   demand\r\n\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2% reduction in GST will mean a major loss to the\r\n\r\nGovernment of an important source of revenue. The Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  lowering  taxes and charges wherever  possible  to  reduce\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs,  and  will continue  to  do  so.  However,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will adjust other taxes rather than the GST, for  two\r\n\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the incidence of the GST is widely and evenly\r\n\r\ndistributed across all types of economic activity.  So  for  the\r\n\r\nsame  amount of revenue collected, the burden of the GST is felt\r\n\r\nless  heavily  than  taxes which levy a higher  tax  rate  on  a\r\n\r\nnarrower range of activities, such as property tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, any short term adjustments in taxes should be\r\n\r\nbroadly  consistent  with our long term taxation  policies.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment had stated when the GST was introduced that  the  GST\r\n\r\nrate  would remain unchanged for at least 5 years. Reducing  the\r\n\r\nGST  rate  from  3%  to  1% may mislead the  public  as  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's long term plans, and cause unnecessary anxiety  and\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding later when the GST rate has to be restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REDUCTION OF PETROL AND DIESEL COSTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nwhether,  in  line with its objective of reducing  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ndoing  business  in  Singapore,  the  Government  will  consider\r\n\r\nreducing taxes on petrol and diesel and/or taking other measures\r\n\r\nto reduce pump prices of petrol and diesel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is closely monitoring business costs.

The tender for prequalification of\r\n\r\ninterested  parties was called on 23rd September  1998.  Further\r\n\r\ncompetition  in the generation sector will come from  additional\r\n\r\ngeneration capacity from independent power producers (IPPs)  and\r\n\r\nco-generators in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, large consumers whose maximum demand exceeds 5MW\r\n\r\nmay  negotiate  and enter into special supply arrangements  with\r\n\r\nPower Supply Ltd on a commercial basis.

Amongst the reasons stated by the Committee\r\n\r\nwere  that,  with corporatisation, law firms can be  reorganised\r\n\r\ninto   larger  corporate  units  to  share  resources  and  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  economies  of scale.   This  will  enhance  their\r\n\r\nability  to  cope  with  the faster pace, heavier  workload  and\r\n\r\ngreater  range of work.  With growth, there would be  scope  for\r\n\r\nconcomitant specialisation.  The corporate structure  will  also\r\n\r\npromote globalisation of Singapore law firms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discussing with the Attorney-General the advantages\r\n\r\nand  disadvantages  of  the proposal,  I  gave  my  in-principle\r\n\r\napproval to the Law Reform Committee to work out the details.  I\r\n\r\nemphasised  the importance of ensuring that there  are  adequate\r\n\r\nsafeguards  to  protect  the interests of  clients  against  the\r\n\r\nnegligence and incompetence of law corporations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Law Reform Committee and Law Society are currently\r\n\r\nworking together to consider the details of the proposal.   When\r\n\r\nthey  submit their detailed proposal, my Ministry will study  it\r\n\r\nwith the Attorney-General's Chambers bearing in mind public  and\r\n\r\nnational interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporatisation of law firms will help Singapore law\r\n\r\nfirms to be more competitive.  Hong Kong has already amended its\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  allow corporatisation of law  firms.   Allowing\r\n\r\nprofessionals  such as lawyers to corporatise is  not  something\r\n\r\nnew in Singapore.

We have increased  the  university\r\n\r\nmedical  school intake to 200 per year.  As this is a  long-term\r\n\r\nsolution,  we  have  in the short term made efforts  to  recruit\r\n\r\noverseas-trained Medical Officers.  We have appointed 59 foreign\r\n\r\ntrained medical officers since January this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear,  in  addition  to  the 81 that were appointed  last  year.\r\n\r\nPreviously,  we  had  only been able to bring  in  about  50-odd\r\n\r\nofficers  per  year, including both House Officers  and  Medical\r\n\r\nOfficers.   This  has  greatly reduced the shortfall  of  junior\r\n\r\ndoctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has also moderated the number of night calls to six\r\n\r\nper   month.    Night   calls  are  an  unavoidable   facet   of\r\n\r\ninstitutional  practice.  My Ministry has  also  instructed  our\r\n\r\nhospitals, where necessary, to pool its medical staff of related\r\n\r\ndisciplines  for night duty rostering.  In addition, departments\r\n\r\nhave also sought to alleviate the workload of junior doctors  by\r\n\r\npractising \"step-down\" calls where more senior doctors (such  as\r\n\r\nRegistrars  and Consultants) assist their junior  colleagues  by\r\n\r\ntaking on some of their calls and workload.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a longer term measure, the MOH Nursing Task Force set up in\r\n\r\nNovember  last year has recommended that nurses should  take  on\r\n\r\nhigher   level  clinical  duties  (eg  intravenous   injections,\r\n\r\nhypocounts and venepunctures).  Whilst the main intent  of  this\r\n\r\nrecommendation was to enhance the jobs of nurses and enable them\r\n\r\nto maximise their skills and abilities, this would also have the\r\n\r\nsecondary  effect  of  easing the workload  of  junior  doctors,\r\n\r\nespecially house officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Nurses - recruitment efforts and increasing training posts</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to the issue of stepping up efforts to recruit\r\n\r\nnurses.  The Ministry of Health, Health Corporation of Singapore\r\n\r\nand the Restructured Hospitals have been conducting a  sustained\r\n\r\ncampaign for many years to attract young people into the nursing\r\n\r\nprofession.   This campaign has included career exhibitions  and\r\n\r\ncareer  talks at schools, participation in careers fairs, giving\r\n\r\nout  of  nursing bursaries and scholarships, newspaper  features\r\n\r\nand television commercials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst these efforts did produce results, it was only this year\r\n\r\nthat   we  have  seen  bumper  crops  beyond  our  targets   and\r\n\r\nexpectations.   The NYP Nursing Diploma programme's  intake  was\r\n\r\n640,  above their targetted intake of 600.  Likewise, the School\r\n\r\nof  Nursing's intake for the Pupil Assistant Nurse programme has\r\n\r\nmore than doubled over last year's intake, from about 70 to 160.\r\n\r\nWhile  this is partly related to the current economic situation,\r\n\r\nI  believe  this  can  also  be  attributed  to  the  increasing\r\n\r\nawareness  of the nursing profession through the higher  profile\r\n\r\npublicity   campaign.   We  will  continue  with  our   on-going\r\n\r\nprogrammes to promote nursing as a career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MAKING SINGAPORE A `MEDICAL HUB'</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if there are\r\n\r\nplans  in  place to use the opportunities, which  this  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  may offer, to make Singapore into a `medical hub'  for\r\n\r\nthe region in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, Singapore is already widely acknowledged as a\r\n\r\nregional  medical  hub.

For\r\n\r\nhospital care, all patients have a choice of wards.  For Class C\r\n\r\nbeds, patients pay only 20% of the cost; the Government pays the\r\n\r\nremaining 80%.  For Class B2 beds, the patients pay 35% of cost,\r\n\r\nClass B1 80%.  There is no subsidy for Class A wards.  Financial\r\n\r\ncounselling  is  provided at the point of  admission  to  enable\r\n\r\npatients to choose their ward class according to their financial\r\n\r\nmeans.

However, the Member would be aware  of\r\n\r\nthe pre-Medisave top-up scheme introduced in 1996 in recognition\r\n\r\nof the valuable contributions and services rendered by the older\r\n\r\ncitizens  to  Singapore.

Another $20 million was  set  aside  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment as an off-budget measure in July this year to  expand\r\n\r\ntraining facilities and other infrastructure in support  of  the\r\n\r\nSRP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SRP was initiated to address the issue of long-term\r\n\r\nemployability  of  lower-skilled workers, especially  the  older\r\n\r\nones.   For  this reason, it is a requirement of training  under\r\n\r\nthe SRP that it should lead to skill certification.  At present,\r\n\r\nthis means certification conferred by the Institute of Technical\r\n\r\nEducation  and  the  Polytechnics.   Courses  leading  to  skill\r\n\r\ncertification  by these institutions have been  formulated  with\r\n\r\nthe inputs from industry.  Workers who are skills certified as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  training  under the SRP are in  better  position  to\r\n\r\nbenefit from the recognition in the market for such skills.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  the gross median monthly salary for an NTC-2  graduate\r\n\r\nis  $1,250, while for an ITC graduate it is $1,500.  As  70%  of\r\n\r\nSRP  trainees  have an educational level below `N'  levels,  the\r\n\r\nability  to  obtain such skill certification  is  in  itself  an\r\n\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present difficult economic climate, when workers face\r\n\r\nretrenchment,   the   Ministry  is  more  concerned   with   job\r\n\r\npreservation as an indicator of effectiveness.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nthe  SRP  has  so  far given encouraging results.   As  at  end-September, over 2,800 workers have been sent by their  companies\r\n\r\nfor  training under the SRP.  Another 1,300 have been  sent  for\r\n\r\ntraining by companies, which had adopted a shorter workweek;  in\r\n\r\nother  words,  they were sent for training as an alternative  to\r\n\r\nbeing  retrenched.   To date, none of these 4,100  workers  have\r\n\r\nbeen   retrenched.   They  are  either  still  undergoing  their\r\n\r\ntraining or have completed training and continue to be gainfully\r\n\r\nemployed by their current employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further 400 workers were sent for training by companies prior\r\n\r\nto  being  retrenched.  These were mainly  companies  that  were\r\n\r\nwinding down operations and had no choice but to let their staff\r\n\r\ngo.   They  agreed to send these workers for training under  the\r\n\r\nSRP  in  order to enhance their chances of getting another  job.\r\n\r\nAll  the  workers have since been successfully placed  with  new\r\n\r\nemployers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NTUC and the Singapore Hotel Association have just launched\r\n\r\nthe  sector-driven  SRP  for the hotel industry.   To  date,  55\r\n\r\nhotels  have  signed  up to retrain a total  of  2,000  workers.\r\n\r\nBecause of the economic downturn, these workers would have  been\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to retrenchment.  Instead, the SRP has  provided  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for the hotel industry to upgrade its  manpower  at\r\n\r\naffordable cost during a lull period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry will continue to monitor the success of SRP\r\n\r\ntraining in enabling workers to retain their jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the SRP is employer-based, the focus has been on persuading\r\n\r\ncompanies to send their existing workers for training.  However,\r\n\r\nas  the  numbers of unemployed have risen, we have also embarked\r\n\r\non  an initiative to match unemployed workers with employers who\r\n\r\nare willing to take them on and support their training under the\r\n\r\nSRP.   The  Ministry will monitor the number of such  unemployed\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  successfully  placed  as  a  result  of  this\r\n\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer term, the Ministry intends to study the overall\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  the  SRP in terms of  the  employability  and\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  earnings capacity of trainees.
