The Indonesian  Government  was\r\n\r\nurged to enforce\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagainst plantation companies that use fires to carry out land\r\n\r\nclearing  activities,  and  to put  in  place  the  necessary\r\n\r\nregulations to enforce a zero-burning policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia has since announced its draft Regulation to\r\n\r\nimplement the zero-burning policy.  In January this year, the\r\n\r\nIndonesian   Government  held  a  dialogue  with   about   60\r\n\r\nplantation  companies  in Sumatra  to  notify  them  of  this\r\n\r\nimpending  Regulation.  The plantation  companies  were  also\r\n\r\ntold  of  Jakarta's determination to enforce against  illegal\r\n\r\nburning  activities.   Indonesia  has  also  stepped  up  its\r\n\r\nawareness-building programmes in fire-prone provinces such as\r\n\r\nRiau  and  South  Sumatra to alert local populations  to  the\r\n\r\nthreat  of  another  haze disaster.  All these  are  positive\r\n\r\nefforts on the part of the Indonesian Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, unfortunately, political and economic\r\n\r\nproblems  have  continued to hamper Indonesia's  ability  and\r\n\r\neffort  to  prevent plantation fires.  In fact, as  we  know,\r\n\r\nthere are already large-scale burning activities taking place\r\n\r\nin  Central  Sumatra.   As a result,  the  Riau  province  is\r\n\r\naffected by severe smoke haze.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been in constant contact with the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  authorities to track the situation in  Riau.   To\r\n\r\ndate,  Indonesian officials have confirmed with us that  most\r\n\r\nof  the recent fires were started by plantation companies  to\r\n\r\nclear   land   for   cultivation  purpose.   The   Indonesian\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  Impact Management Agency (BAPEDAL)  has  since\r\n\r\ndespatched  teams of officials to investigate  the  fires  in\r\n\r\nRiau  and to take measures to suppress the fires.  They  also\r\n\r\nintend  to  round up the plantation companies and  conduct  a\r\n\r\ndialogue to remind them not to use fire to clear land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Singapore has been providing Indonesia with\r\n\r\nNational   Oceanic   &   Atmospheric  Administration   (NOAA)\r\n\r\nsatellite  pictures  to alert them to the  locations  of  hot\r\n\r\nspots  since  the beginning of the latest spate of  fires  in\r\n\r\nRiau. Recently, at the request of the Indonesian authorities,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe   have  also  started  to  provide  Jakarta  with   higher\r\n\r\nresolution pictures acquired from the French SPOT satellites.\r\n\r\nThese  are pictures that can pinpoint the locations of  fires\r\n\r\nup  to  a  resolution  of  20  metres.   We  hope  that  such\r\n\r\ninformation would be helpful to the Indonesian authorities in\r\n\r\ntheir efforts to act against the errant plantation companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides satellite pictures, Singapore has also been\r\n\r\nproviding  other forms of technical assistance to  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nTo  date,  we  have  provided  them  with  communication  and\r\n\r\ncomputer   equipment   to  facilitate  fire   detection   and\r\n\r\nenforcement,  air monitoring equipment, as well  as  training\r\n\r\nfor  their  local officials in the area of satellite  imagery\r\n\r\nand  air quality monitoring.  We will continue to offer  such\r\n\r\nassistance if requested by Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have since written to the Indonesian State Minister\r\n\r\nfor  the  Environment,  Dr Sonny Keraf,  to  express  to  him\r\n\r\nSingapore's concern over the fires in Sumatra.  I  have  also\r\n\r\nsought the co-operation of his office to undertake prompt and\r\n\r\nfirm  enforcement actions against plantation  companies  that\r\n\r\nuse  fire  to  clear land.  My counterpart in  Malaysia   has\r\n\r\nlikewise expressed his concern to Dr Keraf.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current La Nina event is expected to weaken in the\r\n\r\nmonths  ahead.  Weather experts have predicted  that  the  El\r\n\r\nNino dry conditions may return in the later half of this year\r\n\r\nor  in  2001.   For  now,  because  of  the  prevailing  wind\r\n\r\ndirections, Singapore's air quality is not likely to be badly\r\n\r\naffected by haze originating from fires in Sumatra.  However,\r\n\r\nif  the fires and haze there persist in the months ahead, our\r\n\r\nair quality can be significantly affected when the winds blow\r\n\r\nin our direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will continue to work closely with the\r\n\r\nIndonesian authorities to urge them to take immediate actions\r\n\r\nto  avert  another major haze episode.

To\r\n\r\nthis  end,  ASEAN Environment Ministers will  be  meeting  in\r\n\r\nearly April to review the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S.C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, given that the\r\n\r\nfires  have recurred, does the Minister believe that the  new\r\n\r\nIndonesian  government understands the need for urgency,  and\r\n\r\nthe  fact that there is a question of credibility of the  new\r\n\r\nreform government at stake?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very much\r\n\r\nencouraged   by  the  response  so  far  by  the   Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment,  by  President  Abdurrahman  Wahid  and  by   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment Minister, Dr Sonny Keraf. I think they are trying\r\n\r\ntheir best to resolve the problem which, of course, is a very\r\n\r\ndifficult  issue.  They have threatened so far  to  prosecute\r\n\r\nand  suspend the licences of four companies which  have  been\r\n\r\nfound  to be causing the fires.  I think it is very important\r\n\r\nfor  Indonesia  to show that it has the political  commitment\r\n\r\nand  the  will to tackle this problem and to prevent it  from\r\n\r\nbecoming a disaster for the region again.  Not only  will  it\r\n\r\naffect  the  people living in Pekanbaru and  other  areas  in\r\n\r\nSumatra  and  Kalimantan near the fires, where the  haze  has\r\n\r\ncaused  the  index to shoot up at some point to about  1,000.\r\n\r\nOver  here, when it was close to 200, we could already  smell\r\n\r\nthe  smoke and it was causing health problems.  Right  there,\r\n\r\nnear  the fire locations, the fires are really causing health\r\n\r\nproblems to the people living there.  And, of course,  it  is\r\n\r\nburning up Indonesia's resources as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be helpful here if I inform Members about the\r\n\r\nresponse  of Dr Keraf to my letter.  I am pleased  to  inform\r\n\r\nthe  House that he has responded and informed me that  ground\r\n\r\nchecks  had  confirmed that hot spots detected  by  satellite\r\n\r\npictures  were largely due to land clearing activities  using\r\n\r\nfire.   He  has  assured  me that his  government  is  taking\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  measures to address the  situation,  including\r\n\r\nstrengthening its national strategy in controlling  land  and\r\n\r\nforest fires.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Keraf also revealed that on the ground, district fire\r\n\r\nfighting  teams have been mobilised in all regions where  hot\r\n\r\nspots have been detected, and that law enforcement teams have\r\n\r\nbeen  despatched  to  the  field  to  investigate  plantation\r\n\r\ncompanies on whose land fires were detected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome Dr Keraf's public warning that his\r\n\r\ngovernment  would revoke the licences of forestry  concession\r\n\r\nholders  and  plantation companies if they are  found  to  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for any illegal burning activities.   Indonesian\r\n\r\nPresident Abdurrahman Wahid himself has also reportedly  said\r\n\r\nthat his government would take all steps possible to stop the\r\n\r\nplantation fires, and that he had personally \"instructed  the\r\n\r\nCabinet Ministers to take measures to handle the problem.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are positive developments that demonstrate\r\n\r\nJakarta's  anxiousness  to do its  utmost  to  avert  another\r\n\r\nregional  haze disaster.  Indeed, Jakarta has since announced\r\n\r\nthat  enough  evidence has been gathered against  four  large\r\n\r\nplantation  companies in Riau, and that the authorities  were\r\n\r\nprepared to prosecute them for flouting the law.  I hope that\r\n\r\nall  those responsible for the catastrophic situation in Riau\r\n\r\nrecently will be brought to task soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister two further\r\n\r\nquestions?  First, given that the emphasis is on the need for\r\n\r\nlaw enforcement, is there some room to focus work not only at\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of the Environment between our countries,  but\r\n\r\nalso  with the Attorney-General and law enforcement agencies?\r\n\r\nMy   second  question  is  that  since  large  companies  are\r\n\r\ninvolved,  and  some of these companies  trade  or  may  have\r\n\r\nSingaporean, Malaysian or other regional investments,  is  it\r\n\r\ntimely  to consider a code of conduct for Singapore companies\r\n\r\nwho  invest, trade and lend monies to companies in Indonesia,\r\n\r\nin relation to fires?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I think it is very important for\r\n\r\nIndonesia to make sure that its laws are clear and there  are\r\n\r\nsufficient\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteeth   to  take action against the culprits.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, I think the laws are not really water tight.\r\n\r\nI  read of reports in newspapers and elsewhere that they have\r\n\r\nto  actually  get the evidence and find out who  started  the\r\n\r\nfires,  and they have taken video pictures and so on.   There\r\n\r\nis  also  a  need  for them to make clear  the  structure  of\r\n\r\nenforcement.  Is it the BAPEDAL, the environment agency  that\r\n\r\nis  responsible, or is it the forestry and plantation  people\r\n\r\nwho   are   responsible?   Or  is  it  the  local  provincial\r\n\r\nofficials?  All these have to be clarified and, of course, on\r\n\r\nthe  legal side, the Attorney-General could well play a part.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that we can help them in these areas, I am sure\r\n\r\nwe will be happy to do so within the ASEAN framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his second question whether it is timely to take\r\n\r\naction  like a code of conduct for companies, our  stand  has\r\n\r\nconsistently  been that we separate trade from other  matters\r\n\r\nlike  environment and labour.  I think that is  an  important\r\n\r\ndistinction for us to make and we have done that  during  the\r\n\r\nWTO  meeting here and other WTO forums.  I think we  will  be\r\n\r\nvery  reluctant to depart from that position.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand, if Singaporeans find the haze intolerable, on their own\r\n\r\nthey might find it not worth their while to support companies\r\n\r\nthat are causing the fires in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>YEAR 1ST APRIL, 2000 TO 31ST MARCH, 2001</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Paper Cmd.

The SRP\r\n\r\nfocuses its attention mainly on retraining retrenched workers\r\n\r\nand on upgrading currently employed workers who have\r\n\r\ninadequate or obsolete skills.  I believe that it does not\r\n\r\ncurrently provide for housewives or homemakers, women who\r\n\r\nhave previously stopped work, to attend to family\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, but would now like to rejoin the workforce.\r\n\r\nThere are many issues to be addressed in getting women back\r\n\r\nto work, but one of them is that these women need to be\r\n\r\nreskilled, both from the perspective of updating their\r\n\r\noutdated skills as well as simply to regain confidence in\r\n\r\nbeing able to cope in a workplace environment again.  Flowing\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister's two points on Saturday, I would like to\r\n\r\nask him to consider extending the support of the SRP to such\r\n\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir, on\r\n\r\nSaturday,  several  Members had spoken  on  skills  training,\r\n\r\nretraining  and  the  manpower  development  aspect   of   my\r\n\r\nMinistry's  work.   Allow  me to  take  this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly that skill upgrading is indeed an\r\n\r\nurgent task and I would like to reassure all Members that  we\r\n\r\nare pressing ahead with our manpower development efforts.   I\r\n\r\nam  very  happy to announce that the Ministry of Finance  has\r\n\r\napproved  my  Ministry's  plan to  deploy  the  $200  million\r\n\r\nManpower   Development   Assistance   Scheme   (MDAS)   which\r\n\r\nGovernment agreed to in principle last year. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  has given full approval for the $200 million  budget\r\n\r\nto be utilised over the next five years. The MDAS has already\r\n\r\nbeen  formulated  to  support all  our  manpower  development\r\n\r\ninitiatives  by  co-funding with  employers  to  train  their\r\n\r\nworkers,  develop skills standards and also develop  learning\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDAS will support three major programmes: the\r\n\r\nworkforce development\r\n\r\nprogrammes,   the   skills  recognition   and   certification\r\n\r\nprogramme   and   the  learning  infrastructure   development\r\n\r\nprogramme.   $90  million has been set aside  under  MDAS  to\r\n\r\nprovide  additional  support for skills  training  under  the\r\n\r\nSkills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).  Our target is to reach\r\n\r\n100,000  workers  by the year 2003.  We have  also  allocated\r\n\r\n$20 million over five years to support the Strategic Manpower\r\n\r\nConversion  Programme (SMCP) to be launched  in  April  2000.\r\n\r\nThis  was  the  programme I mentioned on Saturday.   This  is\r\n\r\nanother  skills  upgrading programme to train non-IT  workers\r\n\r\nfor  jobs  in  the rapidly growing IT industry.  We  hope  to\r\n\r\ninitially train about 300 IT specialists a year.  $40 million\r\n\r\nwill  go  to  the National Skills Recognition  System  (NSRS)\r\n\r\nwhich  is an industry-driven certification system which  will\r\n\r\naccord   national  recognition  to  skills  obtained  through\r\n\r\nmodular training.  I will have more to say about the national\r\n\r\nrecognition  skills system later.  Last, but not  least,  $50\r\n\r\nmillion  has  been set aside for the development of  learning\r\n\r\ninfrastructure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to support employer-based training, the SDF levy\r\n\r\nwill  also be revised.  The salary ceiling for the collection\r\n\r\nof  a 1% payroll levy will be raised progressive to $2,000 in\r\n\r\nthe year 2004, as announced by DPM last year.  The first step\r\n\r\nis the increase from $1,000 to $1,500 on 1st July 2000.  This\r\n\r\nwill increase the levy collection from $20 million a year  to\r\n\r\n$48  million a year.  The SDF will be committing  about  $100\r\n\r\nmillion  in this financial year for training grants  and  the\r\n\r\nTraining Leave Scheme for older workers with lower education.\r\n\r\nMembers can see for themselves that we are, in fact,  placing\r\n\r\na tremendous amount of resources into manpower development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promotion of lifelong learning is critical. We must\r\n\r\nget  all Singaporeans to adopt lifelong learning as a way  of\r\n\r\nlife.  It  is critical for our success in the knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   While  we can provide funds and introduce  various\r\n\r\nsupport mechanism, our employers and workers must adopt a new\r\n\r\nlifelong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlearning mindset.  From the end of March this year,  we  will\r\n\r\nstart to publicise the need and value of lifelong learning in\r\n\r\nthe  various media. This will lead to the Singapore  Learning\r\n\r\nFestival which will take place at the end of August and early\r\n\r\nSeptember.  This event will further highlight the  importance\r\n\r\nof  lifelong  learning  in  the  new  economy  by  showcasing\r\n\r\nlearning  opportunities and promoting learning as a  fun  and\r\n\r\nrewarding experience. I hope Members will not see this as yet\r\n\r\nanother  Government campaign but as a bold new initiative  to\r\n\r\nget  our  people to prepare for the knowledge and  technology\r\n\r\nchallenges ahead of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong on Saturday raised the issue of\r\n\r\nprofessionalising certain industries. We recognise that there\r\n\r\nis  a group of older workers who lack the basic literacy  and\r\n\r\nnumeracy skills to be equipped with capabilities to  take  on\r\n\r\nthe new jobs.  For this group of workers, our strategy is  to\r\n\r\nre-engineer and professionalise jobs and industries which are\r\n\r\ncurrently of low value-added and are labour-intensive.  As it\r\n\r\nstands  today,   many of these lower skilled  jobs  in  these\r\n\r\nindustries  are filled by foreign workers.  We will  continue\r\n\r\nto  restrict the supply of unskilled foreign workers to  this\r\n\r\narea.   At  the same time, we encourage more locals to  enter\r\n\r\nsuch  occupations  by improving productivity  through  better\r\n\r\npractices  and processes, the use of technology  and  raising\r\n\r\nthe  image  of the industry.  This strategy has already  been\r\n\r\ninitiated  in  the cleaning and construction industries.   We\r\n\r\nare  aiming  to  transform cleaning jobs  into  trades  where\r\n\r\nworkers   can   acquire  new  skills,  operate  sophisticated\r\n\r\ncleaning  equipment effectively and perform their  jobs  much\r\n\r\nmore  efficiently, and hence command higher wages and greater\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  Other areas identified for job enhancement\r\n\r\nare the hotel, retail and healthcare industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government believes that learning, while it should\r\n\r\nbe  employment  driven and employer-linked, also  requires  a\r\n\r\nhigh  degree of personal motivation. For any programme to  be\r\n\r\nsuccessful,  the individual must be prepared to  put  in  the\r\n\r\ntime and effort for continuous learning.  Mr Ong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  Saturday cited examples of workers who engage in training\r\n\r\nbut  subsequently find that they still cannot find  new  work\r\n\r\nwith their new skills.  He observed that when they started on\r\n\r\nthe  training  programme,  they  did  not  have  good  enough\r\n\r\ninformation to guide them. We intend to address this  gap  by\r\n\r\nsetting  up  one-stop career centres, which I have  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier   on,   and  e-Career  network  to   make   available\r\n\r\ninformation on learning and job opportunities. This will help\r\n\r\nworkers  make  informed  decisions on  skills  upgrading  and\r\n\r\ncareer  development.  A pilot one-stop-career centre will  be\r\n\r\nlaunched  later  this  year.  Mr Ong also  pointed  out  that\r\n\r\nmanagement  skills are also important in the new economy  and\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  to  train our managers  in  addition  to  our\r\n\r\nworkers.   For  this  purpose,  the  SDF  currently  provides\r\n\r\nsupport  to  the  SMEs  for management training.   While  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of management training is recognised,  Government\r\n\r\nsupport in this area should be selective and focused  on  the\r\n\r\ncompanies   and  areas  of  greatest  need  since  management\r\n\r\ntraining is already widely available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Government is committed to encouraging\r\n\r\nworkers to engage in skills upgrading, this effort will  only\r\n\r\nbe  successful  with  strong partnership from  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers.  Employers need to recognise that workers need their\r\n\r\nsupport for training.  On the other hand, workers need to see\r\n\r\nthe  importance of training and to engage actively in  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.  A complacent attitude towards skills upgrading is\r\n\r\na  dangerous mindset.  If employers and workers do not change\r\n\r\nthis mindset and move out of the \"comfort zone\", we will face\r\n\r\na  serious problem in the future. We would see an increase in\r\n\r\nstructural unemployment with a growing mismatch between  jobs\r\n\r\navailable  and  a  growing pool of Singaporeans  lacking  the\r\n\r\nskills  for  these  new  jobs. Our  programmes  for  manpower\r\n\r\ndevelopment are targeted at narrowing this gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen suggested that industry experts must\r\n\r\nbe involved in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestablishing  the National Skills Recognition  System  (NSRS)\r\n\r\nand  that  the standards that are being set must be  reviewed\r\n\r\nregularly.    I   agree  with  him.   The   National   Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition System seeks to define standards for specific job-based  competencies that are relevant to industry  and  which\r\n\r\ncan  be  nationally recognised.  Such a system would make  it\r\n\r\neasier for workers to upgrade their skills.  In addition, the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  competency standards  and  recognition  of\r\n\r\nskills  would  enhance  the professionalism  and  quality  of\r\n\r\nservice of the workforce.  It would enable the better trained\r\n\r\nand  better  skilled  workers to serve their  customers  more\r\n\r\nprofessionally and to offer better quality service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that industry experts must be\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  setting  up  the  National  Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem.  We will be identifying industry lead bodies to  take\r\n\r\nownership  of  the development, maintenance  and  recognition\r\n\r\nprocess.  Industry lead bodies are, in fact,  key players  in\r\n\r\ntheir  areas.   They  would comprise  industry  associations,\r\n\r\ngroup of companies or leading companies in the industry,  and\r\n\r\nthe  economic  agency that is responsible for promoting  this\r\n\r\nsector.   We  will  also  set  up Industry  Skills  Standards\r\n\r\nCommittee to establish skills standards, promote the National\r\n\r\nSkills  Recognition  System  and also  review  the  standards\r\n\r\nregularly, as suggested by Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Skills Recognition System is currently\r\n\r\nbeing tested in the hotel, cleaning and marine industries. My\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  working  closely  with  the  Productivity   and\r\n\r\nStandards  Board,  the  Singapore Hotels  Association  (SHA),\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Management Association of Singapore (EMAS)  and\r\n\r\nthe  Association of Singapore Marine Industries (ASMI).  They\r\n\r\nwill  drive  this pilot project.   In addition,  key  players\r\n\r\nwithin these industries are consulted as well.  This includes\r\n\r\ncompanies  like  Conrad International Centennial  and  Westin\r\n\r\nStamford  and  Westin  Plaza  in  the  hotel  industry,   ISS\r\n\r\nServisystem  and UMC ServiceMaster in the cleaning  industry,\r\n\r\nand Keppel Hitachi Zosen and Sembawang Shipyard in the marine\r\n\r\nindustry.  Under this pilot run, the participating  companies\r\n\r\nare sending\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout   250  workers  to  be  assessed  for  National  Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition System certification.  We are targeting to  train\r\n\r\nand  certify  3,000 workers in the pilot phase.  My  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill proactively seek out the industries, including the small\r\n\r\nand  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) which can  provide  jobs\r\n\r\nafter  NSRS training, and also participate in the development\r\n\r\nof  standards.  This will address the point raised by Mr Seng\r\n\r\nHan  Thong  on  Saturday.   He  was  concerned  that  smaller\r\n\r\ncompanies may not be involved in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng also suggested that the NSRS take into account\r\n\r\nthe needs and capabilities of older workers.  I agree on that\r\n\r\nscore  too.   Under  the National Skills Recognition  System,\r\n\r\nworkers  are  trained and certified according to  the  skills\r\n\r\nstandards set by industry.  They do so in modules, small bite\r\n\r\nsizes,  which they can digest easily, tailored  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ncapabilities and working experience of older workers.   There\r\n\r\nis  thus a lot of flexibility for them.  They can progress at\r\n\r\na  pace  that they are comfortable with.  NSRS trainers  will\r\n\r\ndevelop  suitable software to meet the needs of older workers\r\n\r\nin  the industry.  This will encourage more older workers  to\r\n\r\nundergo skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to the remarks by Mr Low Thia Khiang.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he is not here this morning.  Mr Low made  the\r\n\r\npoint   that   training  programmes  must  be  supported   by\r\n\r\nemployers, which I agree.  He would like more information  to\r\n\r\nbe  communicated on the opportunities available for  training\r\n\r\nupgrading.   That is also an area we agree upon and  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething   that  my  Ministry  will  pursue  to  extensively\r\n\r\npublicise all the various training programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to say that during the recession in 1998\r\n\r\nand  early  1999  a  lot of workers had difficulties  getting\r\n\r\njobs.   If  his  purpose is to imply that we have  not  given\r\n\r\nthese  workers  sufficient assistance or rendered  sufficient\r\n\r\nsupport to workers who are affected by the downturn, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  this  opportunity to correct  the  impression\r\n\r\nbecause, on the contrary, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  true  that my Ministry has been very proactive in helping\r\n\r\nunemployed workers secure employment, particularly during the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn in 1998 and even early 1999.  We have  been\r\n\r\nespecially  proactive in helping the lower skilled  group  of\r\n\r\nolder workers who had the greatest difficulty in seeking  re-employment.   In fact, in 1998, it was quite clear  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy was going to take a turn for the worse.  We set up an\r\n\r\nemployment  facilitation team to proactively  hunt  for  jobs\r\n\r\nfrom  various  employers and to offer these job opportunities\r\n\r\nto  workers  who are affected by retrenchment or workers  who\r\n\r\nregistered with the Employment Department of my Ministry.  My\r\n\r\nMinistry was present during the most difficult period of  the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn in 1998 and 1999 at most of the large scale\r\n\r\nretrenchment  exercises conducted by various  companies.   In\r\n\r\nmany  of these exercises, we also arranged suitable companies\r\n\r\nthat  were still recruiting workers to be present on site  to\r\n\r\nimmediately   offer   retrenched  workers   alternative   job\r\n\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry also worked closely with the CDCs, self-help\r\n\r\ngroups, NTUC and economic agencies to organise many job fairs\r\n\r\nduring  1998  and 1999.   In 1999, for example, we  organised\r\n\r\nmore than 10 large scale job fairs.  We publicised these  job\r\n\r\nfairs  extensively  through newspapers, radio  advertisement,\r\n\r\nposters, personal letters to retrenched workers and  also  to\r\n\r\nthe  community grassroots organisations and the various self-help networks.  As a result of our publicity effort, the  job\r\n\r\nfairs  were  very  well attended.  Some of  these  job  fairs\r\n\r\nattracted  crowds of 3,000 people looking for  job  placement\r\n\r\nassistance.   At  every  such event, my Ministry's  officers,\r\n\r\ntogether with representatives of NTUC, the CDCs and self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  would  be on hand to offer advice and assistance  on\r\n\r\nemployment  and  the  training  assistance  that   would   be\r\n\r\navailable.  In fact, in November 1998, we worked with Hougang\r\n\r\nCDC to organise a community job fair at the Hougang Community\r\n\r\nCentre, and this would certainly have benefited residents  of\r\n\r\nHougang constituency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been very proactive in helping retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are under-skilled or low skilled  to  enrol  in\r\n\r\ntraining.   We work with the CDCs, NTUC and various  employer\r\n\r\ngroups  to encourage these workers to take up training  under\r\n\r\nthe Skills Redevelopment Scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this will address the points that he mentioned\r\n\r\nand  I  reiterate that there is no basis to say that we  have\r\n\r\nnot  been  paying sufficient attention to the needs  of  this\r\n\r\nlower  educated  or lower skilled group of  workers  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mdm Claire Chiang who on Saturday spoke\r\n\r\nabout  the  difficulties facing different groups of  workers.\r\n\r\nShe  was  more concerned with the middle management  and  the\r\n\r\nexecutive  group  who  also faced job  pressures  during  the\r\n\r\neconomic downturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that it is true that in our approach to\r\n\r\nretraining and skills upgrading, we focus on the needs of the\r\n\r\nlowest  level  of workers, the least educated and  the  lower\r\n\r\nskilled  group  of  workers.  This is because  it  forms  the\r\n\r\nlargest  group.  About 500,000 of our workers have less  than\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.   So this is the  group  that  is  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable to structural unemployment and most likely  to  be\r\n\r\ndisplaced  as  industries upgrade to  higher  technology  and\r\n\r\nhigher skills level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the executive and middle level managers, most are\r\n\r\nwell educated, as I mentioned earlier on in my response to Mr\r\n\r\nOng  Ah Heng.  They already receive fairly good education and\r\n\r\nfor  many,  they  have been working for  some  years  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany  and  have  very good working  experience  and  track\r\n\r\nrecords  also.  Our universities and polytechnics offer  many\r\n\r\nopportunities for continuing education and training which are\r\n\r\navailable  to  this group of people, and they are  the  group\r\n\r\nthat  would  have  the most resources available  to  them  to\r\n\r\ncontinue such training.  The Singapore Institute of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nManagement and other private sector educational providers are\r\n\r\nalso  doing  a  thriving  business offering  many  management\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the raising of the salary ceiling for contributions\r\n\r\nto  the  SDF,  which I have mentioned earlier on,  would,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  help this group too.  Because once the salary  ceiling\r\n\r\nis  raised to $2,000, SDF would be able to allocate  more  of\r\n\r\nits  available resources to provide training for  the  middle\r\n\r\nlevel  managers.  For this group of executives and management\r\n\r\npersonnel,  they are, of course, also able to use the  income\r\n\r\ntax relief of $2,500 for individual upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not to say that we do not have any programme\r\n\r\nfor  this  group  of  Singaporeans.  In fact,  our  Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower  Conversion  Programme, which  I  had  mentioned  on\r\n\r\nSaturday, could possibly be extended in the future  to  cover\r\n\r\nthis  group.   Initially,  when  we  launched  the  Strategic\r\n\r\nManpower Conversion Programme, we were going to focus on  the\r\n\r\nIT  industry.   That is the area where there is the  greatest\r\n\r\nneed  for  IT-trained manpower and there is a growing  demand\r\n\r\nwhich  cannot  be  met.  So we are trying to  convert  non-IT\r\n\r\ntrained people to take on these new jobs.  But later on, with\r\n\r\nthe  benefit  of  experience of  our  initial  launch  in  IT\r\n\r\nindustry,  we  could  expand this programme  to  cover  other\r\n\r\nareas,  in management areas, for instance.  So we can  create\r\n\r\nopportunity for management personnel to change profession  to\r\n\r\nrespond to the new demands that are emerging in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also encourage Chambers of Commerce and various\r\n\r\nindustry  associations to set up their own life-long learning\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  their  managers and executives.   Under  the\r\n\r\nManpower   Development  Assistance  Scheme,  which   I   have\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier  on, we have allocated  funds  to  develop\r\n\r\ntraining infrastructures.  We can make use of those resources\r\n\r\nto  assist Chambers of Commerce and industry organisations to\r\n\r\nset up this kind of training facilities.  My understanding is\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore National Employers'  Federation  is,  in\r\n\r\nfact, embarking on one such initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I would like to point out\r\n\r\nthat  those  with tertiary educational qualifications  -  the\r\n\r\nmanagers  and  the  executives  -  are  already  much  better\r\n\r\nequipped   to  adjust  with  the  changes  in  the   economic\r\n\r\nenvironment, compared to the less educated and lower  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers.   For  the  managers and the executives,  there  are\r\n\r\noptions  for  seeking new employment, going into business  on\r\n\r\ntheir   own,  becoming  self-employed,  and  be  free  agents\r\n\r\noffering   their   expertise   and   services   on   a   more\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual drive and enterprise will ultimately\r\n\r\ndetermine how each person will be able to make a living.   It\r\n\r\nis  important  that  they also adopt this life-long  learning\r\n\r\nmindset  to  prepare themselves, to keep themselves  relevant\r\n\r\nand up-to-date with what is needed in the job market.  A high\r\n\r\ndegree  of individual proactiveness is required and  will  be\r\n\r\nhelpful  to them in anticipation of any economic downturn  or\r\n\r\nany sudden changes in their job prospects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to draw Members' attention to an\r\n\r\narticle  in  The Asian Wall Street Journal on the 3rd-4th  of\r\n\r\nMarch  (the  Friday-Saturday paper), which is headlined  \"Old\r\n\r\nManager  Learns  New Tricks\".  The article is  based  on  the\r\n\r\nstory  of a Korean executive.  I am sure we will find similar\r\n\r\nexamples  in  Singapore  also which may  not  yet  have  been\r\n\r\nhighlighted.  I am quite confident we have similar  inspiring\r\n\r\nexamples.   This  article tells the story of  a  50-year  old\r\n\r\nKorean  executive  who  was  facing  retrenchment  from  this\r\n\r\ncompany.   Instead of sitting around and bemoaning his  fate,\r\n\r\nhe  looked around to see which other sector offered  him  the\r\n\r\nbest  opportunity.  He concluded that the growth  sector  was\r\n\r\nthe    telecommunications    industry    in    Korea.     The\r\n\r\ntelecommunications companies were the ones  that  were  still\r\n\r\nrecruiting.  So he found a telecommunications company (Telco)\r\n\r\nthat  is planning to replace a manager in about five  or  six\r\n\r\nmonths'  time, and he decided that he wanted to try for  this\r\n\r\njob.   He  is  a 50-year old competing with the 30s  and  the\r\n\r\nearly 40s.  He spent four months learning everything he could\r\n\r\nabout  Telco operations and management, learning from friends\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe business, reading from books and magazines.  He even went\r\n\r\nto  the extent of giving up his golf to jog regularly so that\r\n\r\nhe can improve his physical appearance to compete with the 30-something who would turn up for the interview.  Well, he  got\r\n\r\nthe  job.   From  the story, those of you who are  interested\r\n\r\nshould read the article, the employer is very happy with  his\r\n\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the moral of it is that there is a lot of individual\r\n\r\nresponsibility, there is a lot that we can do  as  a  person,\r\n\r\nfaced  with  such an unpleasant situation.  If  we  make  the\r\n\r\neffort, I think it would pay off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Dr Jennifer Lee who asked what are the\r\n\r\ntraining  opportunities for housewives who want  to  re-enter\r\n\r\nthe workforce.  If we have SRP for workers who are retrenched\r\n\r\nor  facing retrenchment, what assistance is available to help\r\n\r\nhousewives refresh and update their skills so that  they  can\r\n\r\ngo back to work?  In this regard, we are taking a two-pronged\r\n\r\napproach.   First, the Productivity and Standards  Board  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  core skills training programme for  job  seekers.\r\n\r\nThis  was  set in place since September 1996.  And  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  we  have trained about 5,000 new employees,  including\r\n\r\nmany  women.  They were equipped with new skills or to update\r\n\r\ntheir  old skills so that they could fit into the new working\r\n\r\nenvironment.   The  second  approach  is  that  managers  and\r\n\r\nsupervisors  must  also  be trained on  how  to  nurture  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  their  new  employees, who have just  re-joined  the\r\n\r\nworkforce,  because you have to treat them a bit differently.\r\n\r\nYou  have to manage them in a different way because, although\r\n\r\nthey have past working experience, they may have been out  of\r\n\r\ntouch  for  some years, raising children, looking  after  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   Since  they are newly back into the workforce,  you\r\n\r\nhave to manage them differently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have training programmes for managers and\r\n\r\nsupervisors,  and several hundred managers have been  trained\r\n\r\nunder these programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996 and 1997, we started to look at how to get more\r\n\r\nwomen back into the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkforce.  We had a committee called Back-to-Work Committee,\r\n\r\nchaired  by  Mrs  Tan  Ai Lian, to study the  various  issues\r\n\r\nconcerned.  But in 1998, because of the economic downturn, it\r\n\r\nseemed  to  be less critical and less necessary to  launch  a\r\n\r\nmassive  effort to get women back into the workforce, because\r\n\r\nwe  were  already having very high unemployment rate.  So  we\r\n\r\nscaled  back  the programme in this area.  But now  that  the\r\n\r\neconomy has recovered and employers are again crying out  for\r\n\r\nmore  workers, I think it is appropriate to revisit all these\r\n\r\nold  areas and see what more we can do in order to help women\r\n\r\nre-enter the workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1998, we launched the Critical Enabling\r\n\r\nSkills  Training  programme  or  CREST  programme.   We   are\r\n\r\nthinking of using this CREST programme to replace the Back-to-Work  Core Skills Training Programme.  The PSB has set  aside\r\n\r\n$200  million for this CREST programme.  This is  a  separate\r\n\r\nprogramme.   They  have  allocated  $200  million  for   this\r\n\r\nprogramme  which will equip workers with critical  skills  to\r\n\r\nenable them to acquire new skills and competency in the  job.\r\n\r\nThe  CREST programme basically gives workers tools with which\r\n\r\nthey  can learn new skills.  It is not imparting job specific\r\n\r\nskills  but  giving them the tools for them  to  acquire  new\r\n\r\nskills on the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are thinking of including IT as one of the packages\r\n\r\nunder the CREST programme, because IT is nowadays required in\r\n\r\nmany jobs that are available.  So housewives who want to  re-enter the workforce will find this aspect of IT training very\r\n\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the CREST programme has been\r\n\r\nmaking  good progress. As of February 2000, there were 21,000\r\n\r\nproviders  providing 87 training modules in the  seven  CREST\r\n\r\nskills.  To-date, more than 24,000 CREST training places have\r\n\r\nbeen  taken  up  by workers.  We have found  it  to  be  more\r\n\r\neffective  and appropriate to encourage employers to  recruit\r\n\r\nhousewives  and to send them for CREST training, rather  than\r\n\r\nto train housewives first and then try to find a job for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthem.   So this is the approach that we will take.   We  will\r\n\r\nencourage  and support employers who are willing  to  recruit\r\n\r\nhousewives.  And once they are recruited, we will  send  them\r\n\r\nfor  the full range of CREST training and subsequently follow\r\n\r\nup with any job specific skills training that is required.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this would be a more productive approach and it  would\r\n\r\nmaximise return on our investments in training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered all the points raised.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to advise hon.

This  finding is  supported  by  anecdotal\r\n\r\nevidence.  Reports carried by the Straits Times suggest  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans may have seriously over-estimated their  ability\r\n\r\nto meet their future needs.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the facts? In 1995, the median CPF balance at\r\n\r\nage  55  was  $86,000, equivalent to only 32  months  of  the\r\n\r\naverage salary then.  That figure is inclusive of withdrawals\r\n\r\nfor housing and other investments which means that the actual\r\n\r\ncash balance is much less.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1998 CPF annual report disclosed that among those\r\n\r\nclose  to retirement, that is, people in the 50-55 age group,\r\n\r\nonly half of some 80,000 active members have balances of more\r\n\r\nthan  $150,000.  Again, that sum include sums  withdrawn  for\r\n\r\nhousing  and other investments.  So the cash element is  much\r\n\r\nless.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing what is available is only half the story. How\r\n\r\nmuch  do  Singaporeans  require  in  retirement?   Needs  and\r\n\r\nexpectations have increased by leaps and bounds.  There are a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  reasons  for  this:   first,  greater  longevity,\r\n\r\nsecond,  better  lifestyles today, and  third,  a  desire  to\r\n\r\nmaintain that lifestyle into retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a shot at a decent lifestyle after retirement,\r\n\r\nyou would need per month at least the equivalent of what $750\r\n\r\ncan  purchase today, with no mortgage on your house, no  hire\r\n\r\npurchase on your car, and no other debt.  Not many people are\r\n\r\ngoing to have that kind of cash when they retire.  You do not\r\n\r\nhave to be a financial wizard to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nquickly  work  out that unless Singaporeans have  substantial\r\n\r\nvoluntary savings, we may be running into a serious problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the year 2030, Singapore will have nearly 800,000\r\n\r\npeople  aged  above 65.  That is 19% of the population.   How\r\n\r\nare they going to manage if they do not have sufficient cash?\r\n\r\nTheir  children have their own expectations and  obligations.\r\n\r\nThe reverse mortgage scheme will help but can it take care of\r\n\r\nall  affected  members  without diluting  the  value  of  the\r\n\r\nunderlying  properties, and thereby affecting the  amount  of\r\n\r\ncash that will be ultimately available?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has this come about? The CPF scheme was implemented\r\n\r\nto help Singaporeans prepare for retirement.  It is a prudent\r\n\r\npolicy.  But it has had a wholly unintended effect.   It  has\r\n\r\nled many Singaporeans to believe that their CPF reserves will\r\n\r\nbe  sufficient in their retirement to maintain their  present\r\n\r\nstandard of living.  It has lulled Singaporeans into a  false\r\n\r\nsense  of complacency.  The figures show that this confidence\r\n\r\nis misplaced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans should be told that their CPF savings may\r\n\r\nnot  be enough, and in many cases will not be enough.   Their\r\n\r\nCPF reserves are already being eaten into for other permitted\r\n\r\nuses,  which  are  not  as  liquid  as  cash  and  which  can\r\n\r\ndepreciate  in value.  As for the cash, CPF balances  do  not\r\n\r\nearn  the  best interest rates.  One economist has calculated\r\n\r\nthat  the  CPF real rate of interest from 1987  to  1998  was\r\n\r\nzero, because of inflation.  Add to that, the fact that  many\r\n\r\namong  the  self-employed, who account for about  8%  of  the\r\n\r\nworking population, do not contribute to CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be fair, this misperception of the size of the CPF\r\n\r\nsafety  net  is  not  the  only cause  of  the  problem.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore, a culture of instant gratification is taking root.\r\n\r\nAs a result not many Singaporeans plan for the future.  It is\r\n\r\nvery  important that the Government lay out the facts so that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans understand what is in store for them  when  they\r\n\r\nretire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be a sad irony if the CPF policy, which was\r\n\r\ndesigned to help us in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nold  age, is blamed for hurting us in our retirement  because\r\n\r\nthe  policy  led Singaporeans to make some false  assumptions\r\n\r\nabout their worth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do well to lay out the facts and the figures.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be  worth our time and money to give  each  account\r\n\r\nholder an idea of how long his savings are likely to last  at\r\n\r\ndifferent  levels  of  expenditure,  taking  inflation   into\r\n\r\naccount.  It will be a rough guide at best.  But Singaporeans\r\n\r\nneed  to have some information and to act on it if we are  to\r\n\r\navoid a major problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to bring\r\n\r\nup  a  similar  subject  of provision  for  retirement,  just\r\n\r\nbrought up by Mr Davinder Singh, and this is on the extension\r\n\r\nof  retirement age.  Since the extension of retirement age to\r\n\r\n62  was implemented in January 1999, I received feedback from\r\n\r\nolder workers and union members who would like to work beyond\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  62.   This is in stark contrast from  reactions\r\n\r\nreceived  when the issue of extension of retirement  age  was\r\n\r\nfirst  brought  up.  Then some workers mistakenly  asked  why\r\n\r\nthey  should be compelled to work beyond the age of  60.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is no compulsion as the extended retirement age\r\n\r\nhas given workers the option to work beyond the age of 60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are practical people. They want to\r\n\r\nmaintain their lifestyle in old age and would like to work to\r\n\r\nachieve  that.  They want to continue working  beyond  62  so\r\n\r\nthat they can remain financially independent.  Sir, there are\r\n\r\nolder Singaporeans who need to work because they do not  get,\r\n\r\nor  they get very little financial support from their  family\r\n\r\nmembers,  or  they  do  not have sufficient  CPF  savings  to\r\n\r\nsupport  their retirement.  We should stay on course  towards\r\n\r\nthe long-term plan for the extension of retirement age to 67.\r\n\r\nTowards  this end, the tripartite partners can start  talking\r\n\r\nto  prepare for the eventual extension of retirement age  to,\r\n\r\nfirst, 65 and then 67 in years to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a small workforce and, as a result of that, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  bring in foreign workers to support our  workforce.\r\n\r\nOther than encouraging our housewives to go back to work,  we\r\n\r\ncan  tap  the  resources and services of our  older  workers.\r\n\r\nEven  if  we are not going to implement further extension  to\r\n\r\nthe  retirement  age in the immediate future,  we  can  start\r\n\r\ndiscussing the matter among the tripartite partners  so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  understand the issues and problems of the respective\r\n\r\nparties before we can start negotiating.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe):</b> Sir, let me first respond to Mr Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh.   Sir,  the  1995 National Survey on  Senior  Citizens\r\n\r\nshowed  that the majority of citizens aged 55 and  above  did\r\n\r\nnot  make  any  financial provision for  old  age.   Ensuring\r\n\r\nfinancial  security  in  old  age  is  therefore  a   serious\r\n\r\nchallenge for an ageing population, especially for one  which\r\n\r\nis rapidly ageing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past 45 years, the CPF Board has helped\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to save for retirement.  In more recent  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Board  has  conducted a public  education  programme  to\r\n\r\nremind  CPF  members  on the need to  plan  early  for  their\r\n\r\nfinancial security in old age.  Sir, this is done through the\r\n\r\nCPF  NewsLine,  media features and special supplements.   The\r\n\r\nBoard's public education programme is targeted at CPF members\r\n\r\nin  the different age groups.  It emphasises that CPF is  for\r\n\r\nold  age  and  that CPF members should make  a  conscientious\r\n\r\neffort  in  planning the use of their CPF savings  under  the\r\n\r\nvarious schemes.  Sir, the CPF Board's projections show  that\r\n\r\nat  the long-term contribution of 40%, CPF savings should  be\r\n\r\nsufficient  for  basic retirement, health  care  and  housing\r\n\r\nneeds.  Sir, however, there is a tendency for CPF members  to\r\n\r\ntake  for granted that their CPF savings will allow  them  to\r\n\r\nmaintain the same living standards and lifestyle after  their\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to remind CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  that all their CPF assets, including cash  in  their\r\n\r\nCPF accounts, property and investments are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  their  old age needs.  Some may have bought a  house  or\r\n\r\napartment  which is more than what their income can  actually\r\n\r\nsupport.   So these members could end up asset rich and  cash\r\n\r\npoor.  If such members wish to retain their properties bought\r\n\r\nwith  their CPF savings, they should put aside more  personal\r\n\r\nsavings  on  their  own to supplement their  CPF  savings  or\r\n\r\ncontinue  working for as long as they can.   Otherwise,  when\r\n\r\ntheir   cash  savings  run  low,  they  have  to  sell  their\r\n\r\nproperties and move to smaller units.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the HDB has started to build studio apartments in\r\n\r\nvarious  parts  of Singapore.  These studio  apartments  will\r\n\r\nhelp  those who need to transfer to smaller flats to free  up\r\n\r\ntheir  savings for retirement needs.  Hence, if  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ndesire  to maintain a higher standard of living on retirement\r\n\r\nand  want a more comfortable retirement life, they should put\r\n\r\naside  personal savings over and above the CPF.  Sir, as  the\r\n\r\nMember pointed out, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Ageing\r\n\r\nPopulation reinforced the need for individuals to plan  early\r\n\r\nfor their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in support of the Committee's recommendation, the\r\n\r\nCPF  Board has stepped up its public education programme  and\r\n\r\nwork with related agencies, such as the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment   and  the  Financial  Planning  Association   of\r\n\r\nSingapore to reach out to different target groups on the need\r\n\r\nto  \"Take  Charge\" and \"Plan Early\" for a secure future.   An\r\n\r\nexample  of  such  an  effort was  the  \"Achieving  Financial\r\n\r\nSecurity  and Personal Happiness\" seminar, recently organised\r\n\r\nby  the  Financial Planning Association of Singapore and  the\r\n\r\nConsumers' Association of Singapore (CASE) in which  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard has taken an active role to promote the seminar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the CPF Board stepping up its public education\r\n\r\nprogramme, together with the related agencies, we  hope  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would plan early for their old age needs and are\r\n\r\nable  to  enjoy  the desired living standards  and  lifestyle\r\n\r\nafter their retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I will deal with the question which was posed by\r\n\r\nMr  Hawazi  Daipi.   He  has pointed  out  that  the  minimum\r\n\r\nretirement  age  was raised from 60 to 62 years  with  effect\r\n\r\nfrom 1st January 1999.  Sir, it is a bit too early for us  to\r\n\r\nreview  the  minimum  retirement age at  this  juncture.   We\r\n\r\nshould  allow  for  more  time  for  companies  to  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  adjustments and implement the  recommendations  of\r\n\r\nthe  Tripartite Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the Ministry will monitor closely the  progress  of\r\n\r\nthe implementation and carry out a review when the timing  is\r\n\r\nmore appropriate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nSingapore  is a small country with a small population.  To  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent  , we have been depending on foreign  workers\r\n\r\nto   help  sustain  our  economic  development.   Take  local\r\n\r\nfactories, for example.  But for the great number of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  to make up for the shortfall in our local  workforce\r\n\r\nin  this sector, we would not be able to sustain the momentum\r\n\r\nof  our production in Singapore, and the factories would  not\r\n\r\nhave  survived.   In  turn, the survival of  these  factories\r\n\r\nprovides  our  local  labourers with the   opportunities  for\r\n\r\nemployment.   Therefore,  our trade unions  and  people  also\r\n\r\nrecognise  and  affirm  the  contributions  of  the   foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recently attended the ILO Asia-Pacific Seminar on\r\n\r\nForeign  Workers.  It was established at the seminar that  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  other  countries,  Singapore  is  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition  to  give  better protection  and  benefits  to  the\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last year's Labour Day celebration, the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  said  that  foreign  workers  enjoyed  equal  legal\r\n\r\nprotection and the various basic welfare schemes as our local\r\n\r\nworkers   in   Singapore.   In  certain  circumstances,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  even went to the extent of amending the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code  to give greater protection  to  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, like the domestic maids.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of foreign workers in Singapore is very\r\n\r\nlarge.  We have about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n400,000 foreign workers in Singapore.  In the media, we  have\r\n\r\noccasions to learn of incidents of ill treatment or abuse  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  For example, on the 5th of  March,  Lianhe\r\n\r\nWanbao  mentioned  the poor living conditions of some workers\r\n\r\nand  cases  of  abuse of foreign domestic  maids.   From  the\r\n\r\npicture,  we  could  see that it is like an  indented  labour\r\n\r\nhostel during the colonial days.  Although such cases are few\r\n\r\nand   far  between,  maybe,  one  out  of  10,000,  it   does\r\n\r\nnevertheless  have an undermining effect on  our  reputation,\r\n\r\nand  give our neighbouring countries a wrong impression  that\r\n\r\nwe   have  treated  our  foreign  employees  very  badly   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So  we must consider measures to deal  with  such\r\n\r\nirresponsible employers. But I think, more importantly,  with\r\n\r\nour    globalisation   and   economic   reform,   we   should\r\n\r\nsubstantively  reduce our dependence on foreign  labour.   In\r\n\r\nthe sectors which are more dependent on foreign workers, such\r\n\r\nas the construction industry, I hope the Ministry of Manpower\r\n\r\nwill try and help the industry to raise their productivity by\r\n\r\nintroducing innovative construction methods to cut down their\r\n\r\nmanpower  requirements.  MOM should shorten the timeframe  in\r\n\r\ntightening  the Man-Year-Entitlement.  I also hope  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Manpower  would  look  into  the  accommodation\r\n\r\ncondition  for  the  foreign workers.   We  must  tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem at the roots.  Here, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the  present  system of work permit  allocation  has\r\n\r\nachieved  its desired outcome and does the Ministry have  any\r\n\r\nplan to reduce the problems of repatriation.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would advise Members to be brief with\r\n\r\ntheir  speeches, otherwise we would not be able  to  complete\r\n\r\ndiscussion on this Head. Mr Thomas.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, we have a\r\n\r\nsignificant  number  of  foreign  workers  and  they  make  a\r\n\r\nsignificant contribution to our economy.  Moreover,  being  a\r\n\r\nnation  of  migrants, our forefathers, at one time or  other,\r\n\r\nwere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  Because of this, I completely  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe  sentiments  that  the  Minister  expressed  on  Saturday\r\n\r\nregarding  treatment  and  welfare  provisions  for   foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.  Because of that, I just have got two points that  I\r\n\r\nwant to bring up today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the way many foreign workers come to\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  through employment agents and  many  of  these\r\n\r\nemployment  agents  profit from workers who  are  desperately\r\n\r\ntrying  to  get  out  of  the  poverty  trap  in  their  home\r\n\r\ncountries.  We  say that labour should not be  treated  as  a\r\n\r\ncommodity  but  the  way the whole system works  where  these\r\n\r\npeople  pay the agents for a chance to work here, it is  more\r\n\r\nthan  a  commodity. These agents collect the money,  many  on\r\n\r\nfalse  promises,  and  sometimes, they are  brought  in  here\r\n\r\nillegally.   To maximise profits, some of these  agents  work\r\n\r\nwith  employers to change them more frequently.  In all these\r\n\r\ncases, workers end up the losers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Manpower to review\r\n\r\nthe  way  that they bring these workers in.  I know  we  have\r\n\r\nmodified  some  schemes  but  can  we  also  look  into   the\r\n\r\npossibility  of a Government agency being the sole  authority\r\n\r\nto  bring in these foreign workers and cut off many of  these\r\n\r\nunscrupulous employment agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that while we are bringing in foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  cheaply,  we also have problems, which  many  of  my\r\n\r\nfellow Members have raised, on older workers finding it  very\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  get jobs. Most of the time, the older  workers\r\n\r\nare  the first to be retrenched.  Foreign workers are  mostly\r\n\r\ncheaper.   We find a lot of evidence and stories around  that\r\n\r\nthe  employers  do  depress their wages, especially  for  the\r\n\r\nunskilled  levels. We would also like to get  some  assurance\r\n\r\nfrom MOM on what is taking place to ensure that the interests\r\n\r\nof  the  older  workers  are also there  and  wages  are  not\r\n\r\ndepressed too low with cheap foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nrefer to the work permits for unskilled foreign workers, now\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nknown  as  RO  passes,  being  administered  by  the  Foreign\r\n\r\nManpower  Employment  Division of the Ministry  of  Manpower.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  current policy, semi-skilled,  that  is  R1,  and\r\n\r\nunskilled,  R2, foreign workers are granted an R work  passes\r\n\r\nfor two years. Although employers can apply for the extension\r\n\r\nfor  such  work  passes,  they can  file  no  more  than  two\r\n\r\nextensions.  Therefore, an unskilled foreign worker  is  only\r\n\r\nallowed  to  work in Singapore for a maximum  of  six  years.\r\n\r\nAlthough  I  appreciate that this cap is imposed to  minimise\r\n\r\nthe  social  problems resulting from the protracted  stay  of\r\n\r\nunskilled  foreign workers in Singapore, certain  sectors  of\r\n\r\nthe   manufacturing  industry  are  heavily  reliant  on  the\r\n\r\ncontribution  of  these so-called unskilled foreign  workers.\r\n\r\nThese  workers  may  not possess any paper qualifications  or\r\n\r\nprofessional   skills.    They  are,   nevertheless,   highly\r\n\r\nproficient  and  experienced in their  respective  jobs.   It\r\n\r\nnormally  takes a number of years to train up this  group  of\r\n\r\nunskilled   workers,  who  are  well-versed  with  production\r\n\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore a pity that by the time they have become\r\n\r\nfully  trained,  their employment may have to  be  terminated\r\n\r\nunder  the  current  policy.  Once  these  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  have  reached  the maximum of  six  years'  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and are thus required to leave, employers  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to  recruit another  batch of unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and  train  them all over again before  they  become\r\n\r\ncompetent  enough. Overall, productivity  will  suffer  as  a\r\n\r\nresult.   Employers  are faced with the  dilemma  for  it  is\r\n\r\ncritical that the production process should not be disrupted.\r\n\r\nRecruiting   locally   is  also  not   a   solution   because\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are not interested in jobs of this nature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the circumstances, we wish to appeal to the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  exercise greater flexibility  and  relax  the\r\n\r\npolicy  for  extension  of work passes  in  the  interest  of\r\n\r\nachieving optimal manufacturing productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on to my second cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many of our\r\n\r\nfriends  in  the construction, food and beverage  and  retail\r\n\r\nbusiness  are  telling me that it is more and more  difficult\r\n\r\nfor  employers to carry on with their business  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nnowadays.   Because of acute shortage in local workers,  they\r\n\r\nhave no choice but to depend on foreign workers, in order  to\r\n\r\nsurvive  and  to develop.  However, under the very  stringent\r\n\r\nprovisions  under the Employment Act, they  are  like  \"birds\r\n\r\nstartled  by the mean twang of a bow-string\", that is,  badly\r\n\r\nfrightened people. Every day, they have to deal gingerly with\r\n\r\nall  sorts of labour problems. However, it is sometimes  very\r\n\r\nhard to guard against all eventualities.

I wonder if the Minister can enlighten us\r\n\r\non the relevant statistics. Let everyone know what crimes our\r\n\r\nbusiness   people,  particularly  those  in  the  SMEs,   are\r\n\r\ncommitting.  Can MOM leave one side of the net open, and give\r\n\r\nthese enterprising business people some chances by not taking\r\n\r\nthem to court at every turn, as it would run contrary to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy to encourage Singaporeans to venture  and\r\n\r\nbe enterprising?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when implementing its policy on foreign workers,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  seems to have taken  the  easy  way  out  by\r\n\r\npushing all the responsibilities relating to the labour  laws\r\n\r\nto  the  employers.   This  kind of  \"lopsided\"  policy,  and\r\n\r\nimplemented by the inhumane and bureaucratic civil  servants,\r\n\r\nis  bound  to create havoc and invite complaints  from  those\r\n\r\naffected.  By taking such a confrontational stand against the\r\n\r\nemployers, the Government has completely destroyed the spirit\r\n\r\nof tripartism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore parents all wanting their children to\r\n\r\ngrow  up  to  be somebody and the popularisation of  national\r\n\r\neducation, the younger generation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   generally do not want to  work  as  labourers,\r\n\r\nsalespersons,   waiters  or  lower-level   workers   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  and retail industries.  Yet, at whatever  stage\r\n\r\nof  development our nation is, we would still  need  to  have\r\n\r\nsuch a workforce to support the sustained development of such\r\n\r\nSMEs.   In  the circumstances, MOM should conduct an  overall\r\n\r\nreview  and  re-planning  of our policy on  foreign  workers,\r\n\r\nbased  on the present and future needs of foreign workers  in\r\n\r\nthe  various  industries in Singapore. It should  adopt  more\r\n\r\nproactive measures to assist the various SMEs in Singapore to\r\n\r\nsource for supply of workers from overseas, in order to solve\r\n\r\nthe   problem  of  acute  labour  shortage  in  the  relevant\r\n\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the Government can change its confrontational\r\n\r\nstand  against the employers and solve the problem of  labour\r\n\r\nshortage of the SMEs in the same way it assists the  GLCs  in\r\n\r\nrecruiting  their  senior  staff, the  suppliers  of  illegal\r\n\r\nforeign workers will have no room to manoeuvre, and they will\r\n\r\nhave  to beat their retreat in the face of difficulties.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, the Government would not have to waste such a  lot\r\n\r\nof  resources  to  deal with all these problems  relating  to\r\n\r\nillegal foreign workers.  At the moment, the syndicate  which\r\n\r\nspecialises  in smuggling illegal workers must  have  spotted\r\n\r\nthe  weakness in the Government's enforcement of  the  labour\r\n\r\nlaws,  that  is, taking the local employers as the scapegoats\r\n\r\nand not pursuing the root of evil of these syndicates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in most cases, the employers who were\r\n\r\ncharged  in  court  were small time shopowners and coffeeshop\r\n\r\noperators.  Very often, they did not examine the authenticity\r\n\r\nof  the  documents produced by the prospective employees  and\r\n\r\nmistakably took in one or two illegal foreign workers.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  they  were  charged  in  court,  while  the  illegal\r\n\r\nsyndicates  which forged the work permits got off  scot-free.\r\n\r\nIn  the meantime, the illegal workers themselves got to  stay\r\n\r\nin Singapore longer so that they could testify as prosecution\r\n\r\nwitnesses against\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir poor employers.  They were even allowed to work here to\r\n\r\nraise  money  to  buy their tickets to  fly  home.   In  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  how  could we expect those  affected  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  community to have good feelings  towards  and  have\r\n\r\nconfidence  in  the Government?  Worse still, will  this  not\r\n\r\nresult  in  a wrong signal being sent by the Government  that\r\n\r\nits  policy  is  conducive to the activities of  the  illegal\r\n\r\nworkers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with a very heavy heart, I am reflecting a genuine\r\n\r\nlabour  shortage predicament of our friends in  the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity.   It is often said that \"good advice jars  on  the\r\n\r\near\".   But I hope that the Minister would seriously consider\r\n\r\nconducting  a  thorough  review of  the  current  policy  and\r\n\r\nlegislation on foreign workers as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, as a matter of\r\n\r\npolicy,   the   Government   has  encouraged   companies   to\r\n\r\nregionalise  and hive-off their lower value-added  activities\r\n\r\nto  lower labour cost countries.    Many companies have  done\r\n\r\nso  but  some  are  facing obstacles in  terms  of  the  slow\r\n\r\napproval process to bring in their foreign manpower for short-term  training  attachments in Singapore.  I have  learnt  of\r\n\r\ncases  where the approval process has taken as long as  three\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an aggressive global business environment where speed\r\n\r\nmatters   a  lot,  this  imposes  constraints  to  businesses\r\n\r\nheadquartered   in   Singapore  with   support   subsidiaries\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  the  region.   In many  cases  also,  products\r\n\r\nmanufactured  in regional subsidiaries are semi-finished  and\r\n\r\nhave  to be brought back to Singapore for further value-added\r\n\r\noperations  to  be  performed on the products.  The  lack  of\r\n\r\ntrained workers in the companies' off-shore subsidiaries will\r\n\r\ntherefore  affect the performance and reputation of Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for Manpower to review\r\n\r\nwhat  causes  the  delay  in  approving  training  attachment\r\n\r\nrequests  of  foreign manpower, and to assist in facilitating\r\n\r\nand streamlining the approval process so that companies do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  have  to wait very long to bring their foreign  manpower\r\n\r\nfor training to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, when\r\n\r\nforeign  experts, including the performing artistes  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore to work on short assignments of a few months,  they\r\n\r\nalways encounter difficulties with the authorities.\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Manpower has announced that there would\r\n\r\nbe  two  categories of permits.  For those earning more  than\r\n\r\n$2,000  a month, they can apply for professional visit passes\r\n\r\nand those below $2,000, permits. But this will also give rise\r\n\r\nto  some  problems, particularly to the performing  artistes.\r\n\r\nWhen  they  come  to  Singapore to  help  with  some  of  the\r\n\r\nperforming  groups  and clan associations  to  help  them  to\r\n\r\ncompose  songs  or  to take part in their performances,  they\r\n\r\nwould  normally  come  a short time just  before  the  actual\r\n\r\nperformance for rehearsals.  They would not stay for  a  long\r\n\r\ntime.   Some of these performing artistes come from countries\r\n\r\nwhere  the background is quite different from ours.  If their\r\n\r\npay  is below $2,000 per month, then they will have to  apply\r\n\r\nfor a work permit and not a professional visit pass.  For the\r\n\r\nperforming  groups or associations in Singapore,  every  time\r\n\r\nthey apply for a performing artiste to come in, they have  to\r\n\r\nfurnish  a  bank guarantee of $5,000.  If there are  four  of\r\n\r\nthem,  they  have  to  furnish bank guarantees  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$20,000.   This is a burden for those who are not financially\r\n\r\nstrong.   Furthermore, these foreign experts who may be  well\r\n\r\nrespected  in  their own countries were treated  as  ordinary\r\n\r\nforeign workers here, and told to affix their thumb prints on\r\n\r\nthe  papers. It is an insult to them.  I have heard a lot  of\r\n\r\ncomplaints   about  this.    These  are  all   administrative\r\n\r\nproblems  which  can  be resolved through  some  coordination\r\n\r\namong MOM, MHA and MCD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For foreign experts, we should have a special Work\r\n\r\nPermit  (Arts) so that these performing artistes who come  in\r\n\r\ndo not have to affix their thumbprints, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe   sponsors  may  be  exempted  from  furnishing  a   bank\r\n\r\nguarantee.  If it is a clan association, so long as  you  are\r\n\r\nverified by the Singapore Federation of Clan Associations, it\r\n\r\nshould  be  enough.   I  hope that the three  Ministries  can\r\n\r\ncoordinate  better so that it will be easier for our  foreign\r\n\r\nexperts  to come and help us enhance the standard of cultural\r\n\r\nperformances in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, one of the\r\n\r\ncore  ideals in the Singapore 21 Report is developing  strong\r\n\r\nfamilies.  It is the hope of realising this ideal that I want\r\n\r\nto  raise  the issue of work permit holders who are attracted\r\n\r\nto work in Singapore and who themselves are attractive enough\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  to  propose  to  them.   The  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower's  permission has to be sought before a work  permit\r\n\r\nholder  is allowed to get married.  Obtaining this permission\r\n\r\nis  itself  no easy task.  I hope the Ministry  can  be  more\r\n\r\nupfront with evaluation criteria relating to this issue.  But\r\n\r\neven  when  MOM  gives permission, couples do not  just  lead\r\n\r\nnormal  lives and join other happy Singaporean newly-weds  to\r\n\r\nraise families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have to go through another institution to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  foreign spouse can stay in Singapore  -  the  SIR.\r\n\r\nUsually,  they are given long-term social visit  passes,  but\r\n\r\nlong-term  passes can range from a few weeks to a few  years.\r\n\r\nSir,  I do not see how strong families can develop out  of  a\r\n\r\nsituation  where one of the spouses and would-be parent  live\r\n\r\nin  uncertainty as to whether he or she will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  Singapore.  Naturally, faced with the  prospect  of\r\n\r\ncontinual  uncertainty, many who get married this way  almost\r\n\r\nalways  apply for PR status, and in many instances  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  successful, adding to the uncertainty of their  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I ask the Minister whether his Ministry will\r\n\r\nwork  closely with SIR to develop a policy that would provide\r\n\r\ncertainty  and assurance to couples and families facing  this\r\n\r\nsituation.   A policy based on strong families, it  seems  to\r\n\r\nme,  requires  the  assurance  of  an  undisturbed  stay   in\r\n\r\nSingapore for the foreign spouses\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans.  MOM has the first task of ascertaining that\r\n\r\nthe foreign work permit holder should be given the permission\r\n\r\nto  marry.  It should take into account the prospect of  long\r\n\r\nterm residence in this process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I only ask that what MOM has joined together, SIR\r\n\r\nshould not put asunder.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I want to thank all the Members\r\n\r\nwho raised various issues on work permit and foreign workers.\r\n\r\nIn  case  I  do not have time because of the \"guillotine\"  to\r\n\r\nreply  to all their questions, may I suggest that they  raise\r\n\r\nthem on another occasion as Questions for Oral Answer so that\r\n\r\nI can give them a full reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me take the points raised by Mr Yeo Guat\r\n\r\nKwang.   I  think he asked for better policies to look  after\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  who  are  here in  Singapore,  particularly\r\n\r\nhousing  and recreational facilities.  I think the point  has\r\n\r\nbeen  addressed  in  my answer to Mr Gerard  Ee  on  Saturday\r\n\r\nmorning.  So I would not belabour that point again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to say that we have continued to keep our\r\n\r\nlabour  market  open  to  foreign  workers  in  the  economic\r\n\r\nsectors,  because many employers, in fact, do  require  these\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.   We continue to educate the  employers  on\r\n\r\ntheir   rights  and  responsibilities  in  employing  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers;  and  in the case of foreign workers, in  coming  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the employers' dependency, Mr Yeo\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we  should try to reduce the  dependency  on\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  This is in stark contrast with the request\r\n\r\nby  the Nominated Member who wants my Ministry to review  our\r\n\r\nforeign worker policy to allow employers, especially  in  the\r\n\r\nSME  sector, to have more foreign workers.  So we have to try\r\n\r\nto maintain a balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy is that foreign workers are welcome. We\r\n\r\nunderstand that some employers need them, but it cannot be an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunrestricted entry into Singapore.  There must always be some\r\n\r\nmoderating rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also raised several points with particular focus\r\n\r\non   construction   workers,  referring   to   the   man-year\r\n\r\nentitlement allocation system.  This is a new system that  we\r\n\r\nare using to allocate the foreign workers to the construction\r\n\r\nsector.   My Minister of State will have more to say on  that\r\n\r\nlater in response to a cut on Construction 21.  So if he will\r\n\r\nbe patient, he will get the answer later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas suggested that we review the ways we bring\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  to  Singapore.  He  suggested  that   maybe\r\n\r\nGovernment act as a central employment recruiting  agency  to\r\n\r\nbring  all  the foreign workers into Singapore.  Let  me  say\r\n\r\nthat we are aware that there are malpractices going on in the\r\n\r\nrecruitment  process of foreign workers.   But  not  all  the\r\n\r\nproblems originate in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our understanding of the way the foreign workers are\r\n\r\nrecruited is that the Singapore employment agent works with a\r\n\r\ncounterpart in the home country.  We must remember that these\r\n\r\nare  huge  countries  and the workers who  want  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore come from various parts of the countries.  Some are\r\n\r\nfrom very remote rural areas.  No single agency can reach out\r\n\r\nto  all these potential foreign workers out there.  They need\r\n\r\na  local agent who knows the country and people well, and who\r\n\r\nknows the procedures within the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, the abuses or the exploitation of the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers begin with his own employment agent  in  his\r\n\r\nown  country, sometimes even in his own village.  We have had\r\n\r\nreports  of  employment agents in villages in Bangladesh  who\r\n\r\nexploited  their  own fellow villagers and were  subsequently\r\n\r\nsubject  to  vigilante laws by the villagers when they  found\r\n\r\nout.  This has happened before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you have exploitation taking place at that level\r\n\r\namong  employment agents who are their own people, and it  is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult for us to regulate, prevent or to  anticipate\r\n\r\nthis kind of exploitation.  When I meet my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncounterparts in the countries which send their people to work\r\n\r\nhere,  I have always suggested to them that they should  make\r\n\r\ngreater  effort to regulate and control their own  employment\r\n\r\nrecruiting agencies, because that is the only way  that  they\r\n\r\ncan  prevent the exploitation from taking place in their  own\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment agents in Singapore, if they exploit the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers,  if they make unreasonable  or  unjustified\r\n\r\ndeductions  from  the salaries or ask for  very  high  agency\r\n\r\nfees,  we  will look into these problems.  We will make  sure\r\n\r\nthat they do not exploit the workers.  We will make sure that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not run foul of the Employment Agents Act and  also\r\n\r\nthe  conditions  under which we issue the employment  agent's\r\n\r\nlicence to the person.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His other point is on Government trying to serve as a\r\n\r\ncentral agency.  I think that has never been our approach for\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  be the sole agent by which we  bring  in  all\r\n\r\nthese  hundreds of thousands of foreign workers,  whether  to\r\n\r\nwork as domestic maids or to work in the electronic factories\r\n\r\nor  hotels.   It  is well nigh impossible, I would  say,  for\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as  a single agency, to be able to  satisfy  the\r\n\r\ndemands  of so many tens of thousands of employers.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  were  to try to do that, we may well  become  the\r\n\r\nsingle biggest bottleneck to the economy.  We may well become\r\n\r\nthe  single  biggest bottleneck to employers  recruiting  the\r\n\r\nquality  and the number of workers that they need within  the\r\n\r\ntimeframe  that they need these workers.  I do not  think  we\r\n\r\nshould become a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also made a very valid point, which I entirely\r\n\r\nagree with him.  There is an older group of Singaporeans, low\r\n\r\nskilled,  and  they  are facing stiff  competition  from  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  if  we allow foreign  workers  to  pour  in\r\n\r\nwithout any restrictions.  These older groups of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  the ones who are going to be permanently unemployed.   I\r\n\r\nthink we should not allow that to happen.  We should continue\r\n\r\nto  regulate the entry of unskilled foreign workers  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not price our own Singaporeans out of the job market\r\n\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Tay Beng Chuan. Firstly, he said\r\n\r\nthat  unskilled foreign workers can remain in  Singapore  for\r\n\r\nsix years.  Did I hear him correctly?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> I have to correct his impression,\r\n\r\nbecause it is only four years and not six years.  We allow an\r\n\r\nunskilled  foreign worker holding a work permit to renew  the\r\n\r\nwork  permit once.  So it is four years' maximum  stay.   The\r\n\r\nreason is that we want to ensure that these unskilled workers\r\n\r\ndo  not  stay in Singapore too long to either sink  roots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  for  the employer to become too  dependent  on\r\n\r\nthese  unskilled  foreign  workers.   After  all,  they   are\r\n\r\nunskilled.   So getting a new unskilled worker to replace  an\r\n\r\nold  unskilled worker is not a serious problem, nor  will  it\r\n\r\ninvolve a lot of effort on the part of the employer.  If  the\r\n\r\nemployer finds that this worker is particularly skillful  and\r\n\r\nexperienced in a certain operation, then the onus is  on  the\r\n\r\nemployer  to  send  this  worker  for  skill  upgrading   and\r\n\r\ntraining,  so  that he qualifies for a higher grade  of  work\r\n\r\npass  and therefore can be allowed to stay longer.  We  allow\r\n\r\nskilled  foreigners to stay here for much  longer  than  four\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other side of the coin is that while the employers\r\n\r\nmay  be saying that the four years is a problem causing  them\r\n\r\nto  lose  their  workers, the real situation  on  the  ground\r\n\r\nwhich,  unfortunately, many employers are not  aware  of,  is\r\n\r\nthat  nearly  73% of unskilled  foreign workers do  not  stay\r\n\r\nlonger  than three years in Singapore.  Even though we  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  stay  a full four years, they have, voluntarily  on\r\n\r\ntheir own or because of their employers' desire to phase them\r\n\r\nout, left the country within three years.  So if we raise  it\r\n\r\nto  six  years, eight years or whatever it is,  it  makes  no\r\n\r\nimpact.   73% are already going back after three  years.   In\r\n\r\nthe construction sector, a larger number goes back after even\r\n\r\na shorter period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to extension of the period of the work\r\n\r\npermit, I think raising it at this juncture serves no  useful\r\n\r\npurpose.   The point to make is that I hope the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce and all other employers take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnote that if they have foreign workers in their company, they\r\n\r\nshould  make  every effort to help them upgrade their  skills\r\n\r\nand qualify for a higher grade of work pass.  In that way, we\r\n\r\nwill welcome them here to stay longer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also made a very passionate appeal on behalf of\r\n\r\nemployers  who  were found to have violated our  law  on  the\r\n\r\nemployment  of foreign workers.  While we are sympathetic,  I\r\n\r\nthink  most of his passion is misplaced.  Because we have  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  that it is simply not sustainable for  Singapore,\r\n\r\nboth  from  the  economic and social point of view,  to  have\r\n\r\nunlimited  number  of  foreigners coming  to  Singapore.   We\r\n\r\ncannot simply afford a situation where any employer who wants\r\n\r\na  foreign  worker is entitled and can demand for  a  foreign\r\n\r\nworker.   If you accept the position that there must be  some\r\n\r\nrestrictions and there must be some control, then you have to\r\n\r\naccept that those who do not comply with the restrictions  or\r\n\r\nthe  controls that are agreed upon have put themselves beyond\r\n\r\nthe law, and they should be dealt with accordingly, no matter\r\n\r\nhow  they themselves feel about the need for foreign workers.\r\n\r\nIf  you  had employed a foreign worker without a work permit,\r\n\r\nyou  have violated the law and you will have to be dealt with\r\n\r\naccording to the law.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to deal with this problem of illegal workers,\r\n\r\nwe  have to deal with it from two perspectives.  One  is  the\r\n\r\ndemand  and the other one is the supply.  We have  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  very  few foreigners can sneak into Singapore  to  work\r\n\r\nillegally.   That is the supply side.  But we  also  have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  very few Singaporean employers would  willingly\r\n\r\nwant  to go and employ an illegal worker.  That is the demand\r\n\r\nside.   Only  by  working from both angles, can  we  nip  the\r\n\r\nproblem  completely.  I want to say that our  approach,  both\r\n\r\ntrying to contain the entry of illegal workers into Singapore\r\n\r\nand  also cutting down the demand, has worked quite  well  so\r\n\r\nthat the illegal worker\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproblem  is  not getting out of hand, and I think  we  should\r\n\r\ncontinue to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have strict rules about work permit eligibility.\r\n\r\nTherefore, those who choose to contravene the rules must face\r\n\r\nthe  consequence of our law.  I cannot understand when Mr Tay\r\n\r\nsaid  that some employers unwittingly or unknowingly employed\r\n\r\nworkers who turn out to be illegal.  Because under our  rule,\r\n\r\nif  you  want a foreign worker, you have to apply for a  work\r\n\r\npermit.   As the employer, he has to apply for a work permit.\r\n\r\nIf  he had never applied for a work permit for this foreigner\r\n\r\nwho  is  working  for  him, he will know obviously  that  the\r\n\r\nforeigner  is  an illegal worker.  There is no way  that  the\r\n\r\nforeigner is entitled to work for him because the work permit\r\n\r\ncard  carries the name of the employer.  If the  work  permit\r\n\r\ncard  carries the name of some other company, he is obviously\r\n\r\nnot  the legal employer, and he employs the foreigner at  his\r\n\r\nown risk, knowing full well that he had violated the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the kind of risk that the Government is\r\n\r\nencouraging  entrepreneurs to take to  break  the  law.   The\r\n\r\nrisks  that we are encouraging entrepreneurs to take are  the\r\n\r\nrisks  involved in doing business, setting up new  technology\r\n\r\nstart-ups.  To  break  the  law by  willingly  and  knowingly\r\n\r\nemploying  a  foreigner without having  applied  for  a  work\r\n\r\npermit is foolhardy.  The question is one of time: when  will\r\n\r\nit  be  detected?  If you are caught, you must face the  full\r\n\r\nconsequences of the law.  I am sorry to say that, but the law\r\n\r\nhas  to  come  down  hard on employers who choose  to  employ\r\n\r\nillegal workers, otherwise we will have a terrible problem of\r\n\r\nhaving  large  numbers  of foreigners in  our  midst  working\r\n\r\nillegally and causing all kinds of other problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the point that our laws have been unfair by\r\n\r\nputting all the responsibility on the employers.  As  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier  on,  we  take a two-pronged approach  to  catch  the\r\n\r\npeople   who  bring  in  foreigners  to  work  illegally   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These are the traffickers and illegal agents  who\r\n\r\nbring  them  in.  When they are caught, they are  dealt  with\r\n\r\nvery severely under the law too.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe workers themselves are also penalised.  The employers, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  I  have  explained earlier  on,  face  the  full\r\n\r\nconsequence of the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, we are conscious of the fact that\r\n\r\nthere  are  many  businesses that do depend  on  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  to survive.  We will endeavour to meet their  demand\r\n\r\nsubject  to  also  meeting  all  the  other  constraints  and\r\n\r\nreservations such as those expressed by the Nominated Member,\r\n\r\nMr  Thomas,  about  the older groups of workers  and  how  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  they also have jobs waiting for them,  if  they\r\n\r\nneed it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to Mr Ahmad Magad and Mr Seng Han Thong.\r\n\r\nBoth of them spoke about the work permit or work pass system.\r\n\r\nIn  the case of Mr Ahmad Magad, people who are coming in  for\r\n\r\nshort-term training or attachment, my understanding  is  that\r\n\r\nwe  have fairly straightforward procedures for companies that\r\n\r\nwant  to  bring  in their foreign employees for  training  or\r\n\r\nshort  term attachment in Singapore. The processing time  for\r\n\r\nsuch a work pass application is generally very short.  It  is\r\n\r\nwithin  three days if all the information is provided.  In  a\r\n\r\nmore  complicated  case, it might take a little  longer,  but\r\n\r\nsometimes   a  difficult  case  may  be  because   inadequate\r\n\r\ninformation was provided in the first instance.   It  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the employer to provide all the information\r\n\r\nrequired  by  either  the  employment  pass  or  work  permit\r\n\r\ndepartment  to ensure that the application can  be  processed\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng Han Thong asked whether we could make the work\r\n\r\npermit category a bit more flexible.  For instance, create  a\r\n\r\nspecial category for artistes and performers who would not be\r\n\r\nfinger-printed.    Let  me  say at  the  outset  that  finger\r\n\r\nprinting should not be a problem. All Singaporeans have to be\r\n\r\nfinger  printed.  Why is it so difficult that we finger-print\r\n\r\na  foreigner who wants to come here to apply for a pass?  All\r\n\r\nour people have carried a finger print on their ICs too.   So\r\n\r\nthat in itself should not be a difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that we should expedite, and that is what\r\n\r\nwe  would do.  In fact, we had already gone some way  towards\r\n\r\nhelping  to  expedite this entry of performers and  artistes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, we have liberalised the Professional Visit Pass\r\n\r\nScheme   which  allows  the  entry  of  these  artistes   and\r\n\r\nperformers  into  Singapore.   They  can  now  come  in   for\r\n\r\nperformances,  filming, exhibit their work in  terms  of  the\r\n\r\npaintings   or  give  lectures  or  speak  at  other   public\r\n\r\noccasions, or also foreign sportsmen to participate  in  some\r\n\r\nsporting  events.   They can all come in  without  having  to\r\n\r\napply for a special pass.   They can do all these things with\r\n\r\ntheir normal social visit pass and it can be extended for  up\r\n\r\nto  three months, if necessary.  In fact, most of the  people\r\n\r\nwho  are coming in for such performances will be covered, and\r\n\r\nthey can do so with their ordinary social visit pass.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are coming here for a longer stay will have to\r\n\r\napply  for  the appropriate permit, whether it is  employment\r\n\r\npass  or work permit.  Let me say once again that the  salary\r\n\r\ncriterion  is not a rigid criterion.  It is not a rigid  cut-off  point.  We will consider special high talents or  highly\r\n\r\ncapable  performers   who are coming  in  and,  for  whatever\r\n\r\nreason,  they  are going to be paid less than $2,000.   There\r\n\r\nare borderline cases which we will consider on its own merit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as Prof. Chin Tet Yung's point on marriage is\r\n\r\nconcerned,  we  have to prevent a large number  of  unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  from  sinking roots  in  Singapore  through\r\n\r\nmarriage  with a Singaporean.  We have now more than  450,000\r\n\r\nunskilled foreign workers in Singapore.  If through  marriage\r\n\r\nto   Singaporeans,  they  can  immediately  claim  right   of\r\n\r\npermanent residence in Singapore, we could end up with a very\r\n\r\nserious problem.  Already we have difficulty in finding  jobs\r\n\r\nfor  the  nearly  500,000 Singaporeans  who  have  less  than\r\n\r\nsecondary  education.  Can you imagine  we  then  double  the\r\n\r\nnumber  with  another  500,000  equally  low  skilled,  lowly\r\n\r\neducated  foreigners?  At the next economic crisis,  what  is\r\n\r\ngoing to happen? Obviously, we cannot do that.  So we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  assess  those work permit holders who apply for  marriage\r\n\r\napproval.   Those whom we assess to be able to contribute  to\r\n\r\nthe economy and not likely to be a liability to Singapore, we\r\n\r\napprove   their  application.   In  fact,  70%  of  all   the\r\n\r\napplications by work permit holders to marry Singaporeans are\r\n\r\napproved.  The policy is not unreasonably strict.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

This will be done in consultation\r\n\r\nwith  the relevant agencies, including the Singapore National\r\n\r\nEmployers' Federation and the National Trades Union Congress.\r\n\r\nAs  soon as we are satisfied that we are able to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  relevant convention, the Government will inform the  ILO\r\n\r\nof our decision for ratification.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TD 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of discriminatory job advertisements was\r\n\r\nraised  in this House some years ago by the Secretary-General\r\n\r\nof NTUC, when he was still a backbencher.  It was pointed out\r\n\r\nthen  that  there were many job advertisements that specified\r\n\r\npreference for a particular race, age or gender.  This  issue\r\n\r\nhas been raised from time to time since then and again during\r\n\r\nthe  recession.  Could the Minister give us an update on  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  situation  on discriminatory job advertisements  and\r\n\r\nlet us know if his Ministry will consider legislation against\r\n\r\nsuch advertisements?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, in response to the\r\n\r\nprevalence  of  job advertisements containing  discriminatory\r\n\r\ncriteria,   the  Ministry,  in  consultation  with  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational  Employers'  Federation  (SNEF)  and  NTUC,  jointly\r\n\r\nformulated  and  issued  a  set of Tripartite  Guidelines  to\r\n\r\nadvise   employers  to  select  candidates  based  on  merit,\r\n\r\nexperience, capability and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nother bona fide job requirements. This is consistent with the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of meritocracy and will help employers select  the\r\n\r\nbest  candidate for the job. With the support of the  various\r\n\r\nemployer associations, the trade unions, and Singapore  Press\r\n\r\nHoldings, the Guidelines have been effectively implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our surveys of job advertisements in the print media\r\n\r\nshow   that  discriminatory  job  advertisements  have   been\r\n\r\nsignificantly reduced. Compared to January 1999  where  there\r\n\r\nwere  some 32% of job advertisements containing at least  one\r\n\r\ndiscriminatory  selection criterion,  the  latest  survey  in\r\n\r\nFebruary  this  year  revealed that  only  0.3%  of  the  job\r\n\r\nadvertisements were discriminatory in nature. This shows that\r\n\r\nemployers   have  responded  positively  to  the   Tripartite\r\n\r\nGuidelines  and  have  adopted  objective  criteria  in   the\r\n\r\nselection of job candidates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This significant drop in the number of discriminatory\r\n\r\njob advertisements shows that the promotional and educational\r\n\r\napproach  is  working well and has achieved the objective  of\r\n\r\neliminating discriminatory job advertisements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our educational efforts to make\r\n\r\nemployers  realize  the  importance of  recruiting  the  best\r\n\r\ncandidate   based   on   merit  and   capability,   so   that\r\n\r\ndiscrimination,  in form and substance, can be  fundamentally\r\n\r\neliminated.  With Singapore moving towards a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy,  enlightened employment practices  will  enable  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to attract and retain the best talents. This  will\r\n\r\nhelp our companies to be able to compete more effectively  in\r\n\r\nthe  global  environment.

Have any of these measures  such\r\n\r\nas  the  reduction  in  the  man-year  entitlement  adversely\r\n\r\naffected the construction industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, the Construction\r\n\r\n21 (C21) blueprint launched in October 1999 aims to transform\r\n\r\nthe construction industry into a professional, productive and\r\n\r\nprogressive   industry.  The  recommendations   address   the\r\n\r\nimmediate  issues  at hand, that is, low productivity,  heavy\r\n\r\nreliance   on   unskilled  foreign   workers,   poor   safety\r\n\r\nperformance,  and  lay  the  foundation  for  a  stable   and\r\n\r\nproductive industry in the longer term.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Construction 21 report was only launched in\r\n\r\nOctober   1999,  not  all  the  recommendations   have   been\r\n\r\nimplemented.  Nevertheless, some of the initiatives under the\r\n\r\npurview  of  BCA  and  the Ministry of Manpower  are  already\r\n\r\nunderway.  Given the immediate concerns over low productivity\r\n\r\nand  heavy  labour reliance, priority will be in implementing\r\n\r\nmeasures that directly address these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight these areas of priority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the promotion of buildability. More buildable\r\n\r\ndesigns   enhance  labour  productivity  and   lower   labour\r\n\r\nreliance.   The legislation on buildability requirements  was\r\n\r\nenacted on 1st April 1999 and will take effect on 1st January\r\n\r\n2001.   Sir, the long period will enable all participants  in\r\n\r\nthe construction industry to make adjustments and prepare for\r\n\r\nthe new requirements.  Building plans which are submitted for\r\n\r\napproval  after  1st  January 2001  must  achieve  a  minimum\r\n\r\nbuildable   score.    This  buildable  score   computes   how\r\n\r\nefficiently  a building can be constructed.  A  higher  score\r\n\r\nmeans better design,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrequiring fewer workers to construct the building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another measure of priority is the tightening of\r\n\r\nthe  Man-Year Entitlement, or MYE, formula used  in  the  new\r\n\r\nWork  Permit Allocation System.  The MYE was first introduced\r\n\r\nin  April  1998.  It was tightened by 10% in April  1999  for\r\n\r\nbuilding   and   upgrading  project  categories.    C21   had\r\n\r\nrecommended  reducing the MYE formula annually,  so  that  it\r\n\r\nreaches  70% of current levels by 2005 and 50% by  2010.   In\r\n\r\nline with this, the Ministry will tighten the MYE formula  by\r\n\r\n15%  for  building projects and 10% for upgrading  and  civil\r\n\r\nengineering projects with effect from 1st April 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this rate of tightening has taken into account the\r\n\r\nchanges in the productivity level since the last MYE revision\r\n\r\nin April 1999 and the MYE utilisation patterns.  It has taken\r\n\r\ninto  consideration  the readiness of the  industry  for  the\r\n\r\nproposed reduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been monitoring the new Allocation\r\n\r\nSystem  carefully.  Our observations suggest  that  the  main\r\n\r\ncontractors  have indeed been more circumspect in  allocating\r\n\r\nMYEs  to  their  sub-contractors.  So far, for projects  that\r\n\r\nhave  been completed, only 55% of total MYEs have been  used.\r\n\r\nThis  has translated into fewer work permit applications  and\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  unskilled foreign construction  workers  has\r\n\r\ndecreased  since the reduction of the MYE formula.   The  MYE\r\n\r\nreduction in April 1999 has therefore not adversely  affected\r\n\r\nthe industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the time constraint, my answer has been\r\n\r\na  bit  brief.

As we grow economically, there is competing demand for\r\n\r\nthe use of our limited land resources.  Singapore is renowned\r\n\r\ninternationally  as a very well planned and  organised  city.\r\n\r\nThis  did  not  come  about by chance,  but  through  forward\r\n\r\nplanning  and  the political will to execute the  plan.   The\r\n\r\nlast  concept plan was done in 1991.  I understand that there\r\n\r\nwill be one done for Year 2001, called Concept Plan 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what are the main\r\n\r\nplanning  criteria  which he will use in formulating  concept\r\n\r\nPlan  2001.   We  have a current population  of  3.9  million\r\n\r\npeople.   What will be the targeted population in  10  years'\r\n\r\ntime?   On  what basis is this number arrived at?   With  the\r\n\r\nemphasis now on recruiting foreign talent, what will  be  the\r\n\r\ntargeted  ratio  between foreign workers and  the  indigenous\r\n\r\nworkforce?   How can we meet the housing needs of both  local\r\n\r\nand  foreign  workers?  Is the Minister  satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\naccommodation provided for foreign workers?  Today, if you go\r\n\r\ndowntown  on  a  Sunday, you will see the  Filipina  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  gathered  at the Botanic Gardens  or  along  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad, the Indian workers in Little India and the Thai workers\r\n\r\nalong Beach Road.  In 10 years' time, will we continue to see\r\n\r\nthese  ethnic enclaves in our main commercial districts?   Or\r\n\r\nshould  we  not  start working towards a better distribution,\r\n\r\nand perhaps, even integration of our different ethnic foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to different parts of Singapore, to the different HDB\r\n\r\ncommercial  areas,  for example?  We  have  this  for  public\r\n\r\nhousing already where we impose a quota for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neach ethnic household in the HDB estates.  Can we not do  the\r\n\r\nsame  for  foreign workers, not by law, but through  planning\r\n\r\nand  spreading  out the building of recreational  and  retail\r\n\r\nfacilities that cater to their needs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With competing demands for the use of land, how do we\r\n\r\ndecide how much should be set aside for housing, how much for\r\n\r\ncommercial use and how much for industrial use?  Whatever the\r\n\r\nratio  or  percentage we come up with, I think  there  is  no\r\n\r\nrunning  away  from  the  need to  build  on  our  land  more\r\n\r\nintensively.   For housing, the Government has increased  the\r\n\r\nplot  ratios  in many areas already, leading to a  deluge  of\r\n\r\nselective en bloc sales and windfall profits for many lately.\r\n\r\nI  urge  the Government to continue to allow the building  of\r\n\r\nresidential housing to a much greater density and plot  ratio\r\n\r\nin  prime  areas so that more of our residents  can  live  in\r\n\r\nprime areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also build more intensively in the light\r\n\r\nindustrial parks and the science hubs.  If you take  a  drive\r\n\r\nthrough  our science park, you will notice that it  resembles\r\n\r\nthe  Silicon Valley area.  By that, I mean it is  mainly  low\r\n\r\nrise,  well spread out and beautifully landscaped with  open-air  car parks everywhere.  In USA, they have plenty of land,\r\n\r\nhence   building  low  rise  is  logical  and  perhaps   more\r\n\r\neconomical.  In Singapore, as we are short of land,  I  think\r\n\r\nwe  should  start  planning for our science parks  and  other\r\n\r\nlight  industrial parks to be built to a higher  plot  ratio.\r\n\r\nThe  same  policy  should apply to our educational  belts  as\r\n\r\nwell.   Our universities and polytechnics still use a lot  of\r\n\r\nland,  with many open-air car parks.  In their next phase  of\r\n\r\nexpansion,  I  think  we  should  encourage  them  to  better\r\n\r\nintensify the use of their existing premises.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co-location of facilities is another principle we should\r\n\r\nadopt  to  continue to encourage the better use of our  land.\r\n\r\nIn  future tenders of sites, we should have more mixed use or\r\n\r\nwhite  sites.  Hotels can be built with retail and commercial\r\n\r\noutlets  on  top of MRT stations, as in the case  of  Raffles\r\n\r\nCity, which is a prime example of mixed use.  We should  also\r\n\r\nallow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresidential units and hotels to be built on the same plots of\r\n\r\nland.  The JTC and the HDB should relax their strict rules on\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  industrial  land for  industrial/administration\r\n\r\npurposes  and for subletting.  The way we work in the  future\r\n\r\nwill  be  changed  drastically by the use of  computers,  the\r\n\r\nInternet  and e-commerce.  We may be able to work  more  from\r\n\r\nhome  and  at  all  hours as the world  becomes  more  inter-connected.  We should also liberalise the use of the home for\r\n\r\nwork  so  that more people, whether housewives or others  can\r\n\r\nwork  and  look after their children at the same time.   This\r\n\r\nwould  also  help  to solve the problems of over-reliance  on\r\n\r\nforeign  maids.  In order to support this for the future,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  wire  up  all  our buildings in  the  planning  and\r\n\r\nbuilding  phases, not just for private, but also  for  public\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that many people will have many ideas to\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  the  Concept  Plan  2001.   I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  consult  widely with  the  people  and  the\r\n\r\nbusiness community in drawing up the Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, although Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  often been described as a city-state, we are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmuch  more than a city.  Other large cities in the world need\r\n\r\nonly   provide  land  for  commercial,  residential,  retail,\r\n\r\neducational and transportation purposes, and maybe some areas\r\n\r\nfor  parks  and recreational activities.  We need  more  than\r\n\r\nthat;  we are an independent country, and in addition to  all\r\n\r\nof  the above, we have to set aside large tracts of land  for\r\n\r\nour  industries, airports, reservoirs, water catchment areas,\r\n\r\nnature reserves and military training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve all of this and build a world class city-nation, we have to maximise our land use. The Government has\r\n\r\nalways been looking for ways to utilise land more effectively\r\n\r\nand  I  am  heartened to hear that the Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  will be doing Concept Plan 2001 as part  of  its\r\n\r\ncontinual  review  of  our  land use  policy.   Further,  the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan will not be drawn up by the Government agencies\r\n\r\nin  isolation but will incorporate the inputs and suggestions\r\n\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parliamentary colleague, Mr Lew, has touched on\r\n\r\ncertain general principles, and I would like to just look  at\r\n\r\ncertain specific suggestions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, in view of our limited land size, our\r\n\r\nguiding principle in planning must be to intensify the use of\r\n\r\nour  land  and facilities wherever possible.  The  particular\r\n\r\nagency  in  charge of any parcel of land or  facility  cannot\r\n\r\nafford  to  be possessive but must allow it to be shared  for\r\n\r\neconomic  and  quality-of-life purposes.  The National  Parks\r\n\r\nBoard  is  a  good example when it opened its  new  Visitors'\r\n\r\nCentre  at the Botanic Gardens and expanded the use of  these\r\n\r\nfacilities  to co-locate a cafe, and a posh restaurant  in  a\r\n\r\nconservation  house  nearby.  This  allows  people  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nrefreshments  within the setting of the  Gardens  whether  as\r\n\r\npart  of  a visit to the Gardens or as a special occasion  on\r\n\r\nits  own.  More can be done along this line.  There are  many\r\n\r\nother lovely parks located throughout the island.  Could  the\r\n\r\nNational  Parks  Board  consider  allowing  more  refreshment\r\n\r\noutlets, like coffee clubs, to be set up along the fringes of\r\n\r\nthese  parks, so that patrons could have an area to  sit  out\r\n\r\namong the greenery and enjoy the ambience?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another location that I feel could be better utilised is\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Business District, in particular,  the  Raffles\r\n\r\nPlace-Shenton  Way  area.  This area  goes  through  a  daily\r\n\r\nmetamorphosis.  During the business day, it is  bustling  and\r\n\r\nfull  of  activities of commerce.  The car  parks  are  full;\r\n\r\npeople  move  about  with  a sense  of  purpose;  and  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to get a table for lunch.  At night and during  the\r\n\r\nweekend, it sleeps and hibernates.  The streets are deserted;\r\n\r\nthe  car parks are empty; and the restaurants are quiet after\r\n\r\noffice hours.  Food outlets cater for the lunch sitting only,\r\n\r\ncompared  to Hong Kong where good restaurants are packed  for\r\n\r\nbreakfast, lunch, dinner and even supper.  I think it is such\r\n\r\na  waste  of resources to invest in the roads, the car  parks\r\n\r\nand  the  general infrastructure and derive not  the  fullest\r\n\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2032</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Suntec City has done wonders by\r\n\r\nwearing the different hats of commerce, exhibition and retail\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  sometimes simultaneously.  Such a  diverse  menu\r\n\r\nkeeps the place alive, and the infrastructure well used.  All\r\n\r\nthis  inspite of not having the convenient access to the  MRT\r\n\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inject more life into Raffles Place after office\r\n\r\nhours,  I  would  suggest that a large retail cum  exhibition\r\n\r\ncomplex  be built adjacent to it.  This will attract a  large\r\n\r\ncritical mass of people to the area even after office  hours.\r\n\r\nSo,  even  as the financial commercial activities  wind  down\r\n\r\nwith  night  fall, another life emerges offering exhibitions,\r\n\r\nentertainment,  lively  shops and  eateries.   Raffles  Place\r\n\r\nwould  then  not  only  serve  that  singular  purpose  of  a\r\n\r\ncommercial hub.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point relates to public housing estates. When\r\n\r\nwe  think  of using land and infrastructure more effectively,\r\n\r\nit  is  also  relevant to take into account our  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  and the need to create a generally pleasing ambience.\r\n\r\nThese  will  go  a long way in adding a sense of  beauty  and\r\n\r\ngrace to our surroundings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much credit must go to the HDB for continually improving\r\n\r\nthe  design and quality of its flats.  When we step  into  an\r\n\r\nHDB  estate, just by looking at the common areas, we can tell\r\n\r\nstraightaway   the  era  when  the  flats  were  constructed.\r\n\r\nHowever,  more  modern and better facilities, such  as  lifts\r\n\r\nwhich  stop  at  every  floor  and  better  looking  lighting\r\n\r\nfacilities,   or  light  fittings,  mean  higher  maintenance\r\n\r\nexpenses.  There is a correlation between the age of the  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  and  the  cost of upkeeping them.  At the  operational\r\n\r\nlevel,  it  costs  more  to maintain the  newer  HDB  estates\r\n\r\nbecause  they have more facilities and features.  It is  like\r\n\r\ncomparing  a  new car with an old one.  The  latest  BMW  and\r\n\r\nMercedes  Benz  are full of electronic gadgets controlled  by\r\n\r\nmicro-processors.   These  cars  have  to  be   serviced   by\r\n\r\nauthorised  trained mechanics and each service can  run  into\r\n\r\nthousands  of dollars.  On the other hand, I drive a  12-year\r\n\r\nold Mercedes\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n200.   Any  workshop can give the car a routine  service  for\r\n\r\nabout  $100  but I am aware that the likelihood  of  a  major\r\n\r\nbreakdown  is  higher and that will mean big money.   In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of the town councils, the expenses for a major overhaul\r\n\r\nof  an  older estate are already provided for by way  of  the\r\n\r\nsinking  fund.  It is the cost of the routine maintenance  of\r\n\r\nnewer  estates  that is a concern.  I hope the Minister  will\r\n\r\ntake  this  into  consideration so  as  to  enable  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  to maintain the newer estates at the standard  that\r\n\r\nits original designers had in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last point relates to private estates. Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary Koo Tsai Kee revealed  last  week  in\r\n\r\nParliament that the Government was considering setting  aside\r\n\r\nfunds for upgrading of our private estates.  I feel that this\r\n\r\nis  a  very  important issue because in the existing  private\r\n\r\nestates,  there  are  certain areas  that  may  have  slipped\r\n\r\nthrough  the cracks between the various Government  agencies.\r\n\r\nWithin  the estate, there may be a small piece of state  land\r\n\r\nthat has been left vacant because no one agency thought it as\r\n\r\nits  responsibility to fully utilise it.  And, so it is  left\r\n\r\nas it is, and sometimes the vegetation gets trimmed so as not\r\n\r\nto  breed mosquitoes.  However, the residents there know that\r\n\r\nthe land could be put to better use.  It would be very useful\r\n\r\nif  the residents' association could come up with ideas as to\r\n\r\nhow  to  use it more effectively and the Government  provides\r\n\r\nthe funding to realise these ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in land scarce Singapore, we need many more\r\n\r\ncreative  approaches for this city to continue  to  grow  and\r\n\r\nflourish as a vibrant world class home.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, Singapore aims to be a metropolis\r\n\r\nwhere people can work, live and play comfortably in the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   To  achieve this, we need to adopt strategic  land\r\n\r\nuse  planning so as to meet the needs of both individuals and\r\n\r\nthe  business community.  The Singapore Concept Plan  is  due\r\n\r\nfor  revision.   I wish to seek the following  clarifications\r\n\r\nfrom the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What are the key considerations when drafting the\r\n\r\nConcept Plan 2001?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What is the balance between built-up area and the\r\n\r\nprovision of green spaces in our living environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What specific planning features are incorporated to\r\n\r\ncater to the needs of the elderly?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to\r\n\r\nensure  that high-density living will not affect the  quality\r\n\r\nof living in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, there\r\n\r\nwas  a  debate where the topic was really whether our success\r\n\r\nwas  due  to  our  small  size or  because  of  our  leaders.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the team that said the leaders, despite  the\r\n\r\nsize,  won,  not  just  because  it  is  biased  towards  the\r\n\r\nleadership in Singapore, but because of the points  they  put\r\n\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point I want to make here is that one of them\r\n\r\nsuggested that, suppose we had a big space, say, of Batam  or\r\n\r\nBintan  size,  in addition to what we have,  and  whether  we\r\n\r\nwould have done it.  It remains a hypothetical question.  But\r\n\r\nit  brings me to this topic today.  If you look at  the  last\r\n\r\nfew  years, various things had happened in Singapore.  We had\r\n\r\ngone  through various policies to curtail the property bubble\r\n\r\nand we did the right things ahead of time in 1996 that, today\r\n\r\nwe  have  come  out  of  this  potentially  big  bubble  from\r\n\r\nbursting,  as  it  has happened in some of  the  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in the last decade or so, many of the young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have aspired to own a private property  and  we\r\n\r\nhave  done  reasonably  well to increase  the  percentage  of\r\n\r\nprivate  homes in Singapore from 14% in 1990 to  the  current\r\n\r\n18%.  And more and more younger Singaporeans still aspire  to\r\n\r\nown private residence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we have been always referred to as a fine city\r\n\r\nby  many foreigners (I think we have 7 million tourists every\r\n\r\nyear)  and,  as  our PM said at the National Day  Rally  last\r\n\r\nyear,  we  should also try to become a fun  city.   All  this\r\n\r\nmeans  that, as our population grows, and I do not know  what\r\n\r\nis the optimum population, I would like to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nask the Minister what is the target over the next 10-20 years\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  can target for so that living  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould be more comfortable and it would not be as congested as\r\n\r\nit  is  in,  say,  Hong Kong.  Given all these  developments,\r\n\r\ntogether   with  the  attraction  of  foreign  talents   into\r\n\r\nSingapore to build our knowledge-based economy, I would  like\r\n\r\nto  find  out  what the review that the GPC  Chairman  talked\r\n\r\nabout  Concept  2001  would be and whether  some  fundamental\r\n\r\nreview  would  be  done to take into account  some  of  these\r\n\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for MTI, Mr Lim Swee Say, last\r\n\r\nweek  mentioned  that  his  Ministry  will  be  looking  into\r\n\r\nincreasing   the  optimum  use  of  land  in  Singapore   for\r\n\r\nindustrial  use by building more multi-storey factories,  and\r\n\r\nso  on.   I  would like to find out how the commercial  angle\r\n\r\nwould  be looked at from the MND's point of view and  whether\r\n\r\nwe  would  also  be pulling down those one storey  commercial\r\n\r\ndevelopments  and  try to make greater  optimum  use  of  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  land  that  we have in  Singapore,  and  how  the\r\n\r\npresent tenants would be compensated for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the residential side, I would like to know whether we\r\n\r\nwill  move  from this 18% upwards to a higher  percentage  so\r\n\r\nthat  more  of the younger Singaporeans can afford a  private\r\n\r\nhome.   Also,  like  what Mr Ong Kian Min mentioned,  whether\r\n\r\nthere  will be greater developments in downtown, particularly\r\n\r\nin  the  Marina South that we have heard about, whether  land\r\n\r\nhas  already  been released fully, if not,  when  would  this\r\n\r\ndowntown  development be completed.  Sir, I  hope  all  these\r\n\r\nanswers  would be in the review that the Ministry is planning\r\n\r\nto undertake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I end, I just want to mention something about the\r\n\r\nland  sales which are of great importance to a lot of  people\r\n\r\nin  this  House  and  outside.  Sir,  the  Government  has  a\r\n\r\nreasonably good approach to land sales in Singapore which, on\r\n\r\nthe  one  hand, looks good on paper, but in practice,  it  is\r\n\r\nmuch more complicated to implement.  Because it does not make\r\n\r\neither the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperty  developers  or  those  who  have  aspired  to   buy\r\n\r\nproperties happy.  Just look at what had happened in the last\r\n\r\nyear.   The residential property prices went up 33% in  1999.\r\n\r\nAnd many of the constituents that I spoke to, felt it was far\r\n\r\ntoo  much in too short a period of time, ie, 33% in  a  year.\r\n\r\nWhen  I spoke to some of these developers, they told me  that\r\n\r\n\"Well,  it  is  still 27% lower than it  was  in  the  second\r\n\r\nquarter of 1996.\"  So the question is: how do we balance this\r\n\r\nexpectation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important point is that, in the last 10-15 years,\r\n\r\nmany  corporate companies, bus companies, for instance,  have\r\n\r\ngone  into  property.  So have many other entirely  different\r\n\r\nbusiness  focused  companies gone into property.   This  gold\r\n\r\nrush   towards  property development where you can  make  all\r\n\r\nyour  money  must change.  The mindsets of Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nchange.   While we want property prices to be stabilised,  it\r\n\r\nshould not be accelerating too much, too fast.  We should use\r\n\r\nthis  Internet  boom, where everybody is now rushing  towards\r\n\r\nthe  Internet,  to move away from the focus towards  property\r\n\r\nand try to stabilise property prices in Singapore so that  we\r\n\r\ndo   not  get  pushed  by  just  the  developers  but,   more\r\n\r\nimportantly, we cater to the needs of the silent majority  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who aspire to own property.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I hope that the Minister will look\r\n\r\ninto all these points in this review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, as stated in the Development\r\n\r\nControl  Handbook  1991, developers of  industrial  buildings\r\n\r\nwith  a  gross  floor area of above 5,000 square  metres  are\r\n\r\nrequired  to retain 30% of the development for 10 years  from\r\n\r\nthe  latest date of TOP issuance.  This policy was introduced\r\n\r\nto  ensure that one major stakeholder would be responsible to\r\n\r\nprevent common properties of such buildings from falling into\r\n\r\ndisrepair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the progress of time and the increased\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of property management firms, such policy has\r\n\r\nbecome obsolete.  To date, the Strata Titles Act has adequate\r\n\r\nprovisions to make sure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  all  buildings  are  well  maintained.   As  such,  all\r\n\r\nresidential developments are no longer required to  have  30%\r\n\r\nretention,  and  yet are properly managed by  the  respective\r\n\r\nManagement Corporations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 30% retention policy for industrial buildings has\r\n\r\nindeed  increased  the holding cost and financial  burden  of\r\n\r\ndevelopers   and  industrialists.   It  also  restricts   the\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  developers or  industrialists  to  expand\r\n\r\ntheir businesses.  Although developers or industrialists  can\r\n\r\nsell  the 30% to a single purchaser, the transaction  chances\r\n\r\nare  low.  Thus, I would urge the Ministry to reconsider this\r\n\r\npolicy of 30% retention for industrial building development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> I know that the CIDB, and now the BCA,\r\n\r\nhas been working hard to improve the productivity and quality\r\n\r\nin  the  construction sector.

I would like to ask the Minister how  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of our construction sector compares with that of\r\n\r\nthe  developed  countries, like USA, Germany,  Australia  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   I am given to understand that it still takes  a  lot\r\n\r\nlonger to build a building in Singapore than in some of these\r\n\r\ncountries.   Why  is  that so?

Otherwise, they would end up just\r\n\r\nas well-prepared academic studies.\r\n\r\n<br>2.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 39 recommendations are well-researched and relevant.\r\n\r\nBut  there are still many areas which I feel should need more\r\n\r\nattention  and  scrutiny. I shall mention two more  important\r\n\r\nones. The first is our contracting system, in respect of  the\r\n\r\nprofessionalism of our contractors. While there are a  number\r\n\r\nof   fairly   competent  and  professional   contractors   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  many  could not measure up to the professionalism\r\n\r\nit requires.  Most construction companies are still headed by\r\n\r\nnon-qualified professionals.  It is not uncommon that  having\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  secured  the  contract,  the  partner  of   the\r\n\r\nconstruction firm would appear only for the first meeting and\r\n\r\nsubsequently leave the job to the employed project  managers,\r\n\r\nwho  may or may not be professionally qualified.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they are employed personnel, they do not  have\r\n\r\nany personal commitment to the company and, therefore, it  is\r\n\r\nnot unusual to see project manager posts change three or four\r\n\r\ntimes during the duration of the project.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under such a situation, even if all other productivity\r\n\r\nfactors are in place, it is impossible to see how the project\r\n\r\ncan  be  completed in time and achieve the high standards  it\r\n\r\nrequires.   Before  we can consider all  the  other  numerous\r\n\r\nproblems  associated with the industry, we must first  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  our contracting firms must have qualified professionals\r\n\r\nas  partners,  especially those who  are  in  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nproject.  Therefore, it may be necessary for the Ministry  to\r\n\r\nconsider  registering builders in the same  manner  in  which\r\n\r\nprofessional architects and engineers are being registered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is an urgent need to ensure a constant\r\n\r\nsupply  of skilled labour.  Many Members have already  spoken\r\n\r\nof such requirements.  It is a serious problem, especially as\r\n\r\nwe  are  so  short of manpower.  The requirement for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to go through a few weeks, or even one or two  months\r\n\r\nof skills training cannot resolve the problem.  We must train\r\n\r\nour  own  local  workers as tradesman.  In  Australia,  every\r\n\r\nconstruction worker is a certificate holder.  They  go  to  a\r\n\r\ntrade  school for two or three years to acquire the necessary\r\n\r\nskills. They do not consider themselves labourers, but rather\r\n\r\nas tradesmen who are highly skilled and productive.  They may\r\n\r\neven  earn more than the professionals.  Very often, you  see\r\n\r\nfour or five tradesmen working on the construction site of  a\r\n\r\nhouse  in  Australia and it takes 6 to 8  months  to  finish,\r\n\r\ncompared to the 20 to 30 labourers running around on the same\r\n\r\nproject  in  Singapore,  and taking  11/2  to  two  years  to\r\n\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more areas which the Ministry can tap on\r\n\r\nthe  experience  of  the professionals  and  the  experienced\r\n\r\npersonnel in the industry.  Their inputs are required to  see\r\n\r\nthat  all  the  recommendations in  the  Construction  21  be\r\n\r\nimplemented  effectively  and, more importantly,  to  examine\r\n\r\nmore  in-depth areas where the report needs refinement or  be\r\n\r\nsupplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that this will be the beginning of a\r\n\r\nnew era in our construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the Construction 21 report aims to\r\n\r\nproduce  world-class builders. To achieve this, there  is  an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  to inject more professionalism in the  building\r\n\r\nindustry.  We  must  develop  a  core  capability  of   local\r\n\r\nconstruction firms and provide more support for  these  firms\r\n\r\nto   be   world-class.    I  wish  to  seek   the   following\r\n\r\nclarifications from the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the policy of the Ministry in nurturing\r\n\r\npotential world-class builders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Will the Ministry provide incentives for\r\n\r\nconstruction  firms  to  merge  and  strengthen  their   core\r\n\r\ncapabilities?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to\r\n\r\nimprove professionalism in the industry?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Will the Ministry consider licensing building\r\n\r\nprofessionals so that better professional accountability  can\r\n\r\nbe achieved?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, we have a public housing scheme\r\n\r\nthat is the most comprehensive in the world, catering to  82%\r\n\r\nof  the  population.  This means that even  the  upper-middle\r\n\r\nincome  people live in public housing.  You would think  that\r\n\r\nthis   group  of  people  would  appreciate  and  thank   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for the privilege of being able to live in  public\r\n\r\nhousing  at  subsidised prices despite their  income  levels.\r\n\r\nYet,  we know that this is not so and they all aspire to move\r\n\r\nto  private  housing at the earliest opportunity, whether  in\r\n\r\nlanded  properties or condominiums.  This brings  me  to  the\r\n\r\nissue  of our public housing policy. The question is:  should\r\n\r\nwe  continue  to  cater to the needs of  upper-middle  income\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   through  premium  HDB  flats   and   executive\r\n\r\ncondominiums?  I think no matter what name we  give  it,  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  finishing we put on it, it is still  deemed  a  HDB\r\n\r\nflat and is regarded as public housing.  In fact, such upper-middle income Singaporeans, who are usually\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyounger  professionals, are a bit embarrassed and  apologetic\r\n\r\nwhen they disclose that they still live in HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the Government review this\r\n\r\npolicy   of   building  premium  HDB  flats   and   Executive\r\n\r\nCondominiums and let the private sector assume a bigger  role\r\n\r\nfor this segment of the market. We could release more land to\r\n\r\nthe  private sector for this purpose so as to keep the  lower\r\n\r\nend  of  the private housing market affordable and provide  a\r\n\r\nmore gradual and seamless transaction from public housing  to\r\n\r\nprivate housing.  When we provide so much public housing,  we\r\n\r\nare  unwittingly creating an over dependency syndrome on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which will be an obstacle to  the  promotion  of\r\n\r\ngreater   entrepreneurship  and  innovation.   I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment will review this policy seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I join the GPC Chairman in\r\n\r\nmaking a similar point, but from a different angle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the last decade or more, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  moved  from  regulatory statutory boards  to  make  them\r\n\r\ncorporatised, and then to private particularly  for  some  of\r\n\r\nthe  monopolies  that exist in Singapore. I will  give  three\r\n\r\nexamples.   First  is the SIM group which took  over  TCS  to\r\n\r\nbecome several companies who compete with each other. We have\r\n\r\ngot TCS, TV12 and so on. Second is the transport structure in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   For the bus services, we now not only  have  SBS\r\n\r\nbut TIBS as well, competing in some areas. Then the MRT.   We\r\n\r\nare   going  to  have  a  new  competitor  to  run  MRT.  For\r\n\r\ntelecommunications, we have liberalised. StarHub is coming in\r\n\r\nand  competition  will  be there. I think  the  key  word  is\r\n\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you look at public housing today in Singapore,\r\n\r\nHDB  is the monopoly.  I have served as a board member in HDB\r\n\r\nand  I  would  say  that  HDB  is  doing  an  excellent  job,\r\n\r\nparticularly under its CEO, Mr Tan Guong Ching and  his  team\r\n\r\nand  their productivity is extremely high, their buildability\r\n\r\nexcellent by international standards and we have gone to Hong\r\n\r\nKong to compare what we are doing, and we have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncome up tops.  And we learnt from Hong Kong in the 1960s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point that I would like to make is that it may\r\n\r\nbe  time  to look at an alternative to HDB, that is, to  have\r\n\r\ntwo  companies  that do public housing.  I do not  completely\r\n\r\nagree  with  the idea that we should push everything  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector because for public housing, there are certain\r\n\r\nthings that the Government should still have control. The one\r\n\r\nbetter  way would be to split HDB, just like the way that  we\r\n\r\nhave  run town councils and their services.  It was all  done\r\n\r\nby HDB, but now the town councils are running it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way for building HDB flats, we could split\r\n\r\nit out and spin off two companies which compete head on under\r\n\r\nsimilar rules set by Government.  This will make the building\r\n\r\nof  public  housing much more efficient through  competition,\r\n\r\nwhere quality of designs will improve and they will benchmark\r\n\r\nthemselves  with  the best in the private housing.   The  two\r\n\r\ncompanies,  if set up, will look critically at  the  building\r\n\r\ncost  and  continually find ways to reduce these costs,  just\r\n\r\nlike  the  way  that the computer industry  is  driving  down\r\n\r\nprices  every  day.   We may not be seeing  price  reductions\r\n\r\nevery  day,  but  I am sure that the prices will  come  down.\r\n\r\nOverall,  the bottomline is that the Singapore citizens  will\r\n\r\nbe  much happier that the price does not go up too much,  too\r\n\r\nsoon.   On  that note, I would like to call for a  review  of\r\n\r\nthis public housing policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point I want to add here is regarding the\r\n\r\nupgrading  scheme that we have.  The Main Upgrading Programme\r\n\r\n(MUP) is an excellent scheme but it is time to review how  we\r\n\r\naddress this space adding item (SAI), particularly for the 4-and 5-roomers. Maybe, we have to do away with this scheme for\r\n\r\n4- and 5-roomers and concentrate it on the 3-roomers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that we now only do certain items for\r\n\r\nthe  MUP.  I  would like to propose that as long  as  it  has\r\n\r\nanything  to  do with the facade of the building,  we  should\r\n\r\nchange it completely. For example, we do the painting, but we\r\n\r\ndo not change\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  windows.  I think it will be useful if the MUP  includes\r\n\r\nthe changing of windows or the grilles so that when it is all\r\n\r\ndone,  it  looks as good as a new flat.  I hope the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill take these points into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, a recent research in the United\r\n\r\nKingdom has shown interesting housing trends in Europe.  Home\r\n\r\nownership policy has become problematic resulting in  various\r\n\r\nproblems in some countries.  It was found that countries with\r\n\r\nhigh   home   ownership  also  have  high   social   services\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  Those with high home ownership also experienced\r\n\r\nhigher unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two possible reasons were cited for these trends.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  market forces have severe impact on  job  security,\r\n\r\nthus  making homeowners more vulnerable and unable to service\r\n\r\ntheir mortgages. Secondly, people tend to lose their drive to\r\n\r\nwork  or quit work once their mortgages are fully paid,  thus\r\n\r\nresulting in wastages of human talent and resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of these trends, I wish to make the following\r\n\r\nclarifications with the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the percentage of HDB homeowners in\r\n\r\nmortgage  payment arrears or receiving welfare assistance  in\r\n\r\nthe last 10 year?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the measures taken by the Ministry to\r\n\r\nbalance between home ownership and family nuclearisation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry consider removing the 5-year\r\n\r\noccupation  requirement, and allow HDB flat  owners  to  swop\r\n\r\nflats at market rates to live near their family members?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) What is the impact of the home ownership policy on\r\n\r\nthe mobility of labour in Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I would also\r\n\r\nlike to provide a slightly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  perspective  from Mr Lew  on  the  same  topic  of\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominiums (ECs).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I recall, the EC scheme was conceived a few years\r\n\r\nback  to  cater to the growing sandwiched segment,  that  is,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  were closed out of the  private  upgrading\r\n\r\nmarket  because of run away private property prices. We  have\r\n\r\nyet  to complete a cycle for the ECs, but already the Housing\r\n\r\nand   Development  Board  is  offering  premium   apartments,\r\n\r\npurportedly  by  a  revamp  of two existing  design-and-build\r\n\r\nschemes.   Based on the proposed design features and  pricing\r\n\r\nlevels for these premium apartments, and notwithstanding some\r\n\r\ndifferences, I would like to ask the Minister what  would  be\r\n\r\nthe impact of this offer on the EC scheme and, indirectly, on\r\n\r\nthe Executive Apartment Scheme as well, and its impact on the\r\n\r\nresale potential for such apartments. Would this scheme  pose\r\n\r\nunfair competition for EC developers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to echo some of Mr Sinnakaruppan's\r\n\r\nsentiments. A fundamental question would be the need for  HDB\r\n\r\nto be involved in meeting needs beyond the basic level which,\r\n\r\nfor  the sake of argument, could refer to housing for  first-timers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, building new\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  is one of the key priorities  of  HDB.  The\r\n\r\nusual  reaction of a potential house owner would  be  one  of\r\n\r\neager anticipation. Upon receiving his keys, the reaction  is\r\n\r\none  of  joy.  Upon moving into the new estate,  his  joy  is\r\n\r\ntempered and harsh realities set in. Soon, the inconveniences\r\n\r\nof  a new estate will dawn upon him.  Sengkang New Town is  a\r\n\r\ncase in point.  It was touted as the new town to live in.  It\r\n\r\nwas  a town where the conveniences of a new estate are to  be\r\n\r\nmatched   by   a  superb  transportation  system.    However,\r\n\r\nresidents  who  have moved in over the past  few  years  have\r\n\r\nfaced  the harsh realities.  Conveniences are far and few  in\r\n\r\nbetween, and inconveniences abound.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>3.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, much can be done to improve the design of\r\n\r\nfuture flats in Sengkang.  Covered linkways are aesthetically\r\n\r\nappealing to the eye, but often do not shelter you  from  the\r\n\r\nrain.   I  have  walked there at night and even  in  a  light\r\n\r\ndrizzle,  you get wet.  Block signs are so small that  it  is\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult to find your way around, not  only  when\r\n\r\nyou drive around the parameter but even when you are within a\r\n\r\ncluster itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amenities are few and therefore prices of goods,\r\n\r\nincluding market produce, are significantly higher than other\r\n\r\nplaces.   Although  there are at least about  20,000  housing\r\n\r\nunits,  there are only two clinics tucked away in one corner.\r\n\r\nThe  scarcity of amenities has resulted in outrageous  rents.\r\n\r\nThis  has been passed back to the consumer as an increase  in\r\n\r\nconsumer prices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, in terms of the comparison of rental\r\n\r\nprices  of  clinic  space,  in Ang Mo  Kio  estate,  existing\r\n\r\nrentals  for  a  precinct are about $3 per  sq  ft.   Hougang\r\n\r\nestate  is  about  $4 per sq ft.  These are  for  HDB  rental\r\n\r\nunits.  For those which have been sold by HDB and sub-let, it\r\n\r\nis  about $9-$15 per sq ft.  Those in Sengkang range from $25\r\n\r\n-  $34 per sq ft.  So if we compare them to Ang Mo Kio, it is\r\n\r\nalmost 10 times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For shops or market units in comparison, in Ang Mo Kio,\r\n\r\nthe  going  rate  for a flower stall is about  $250-$468  per\r\n\r\nmonth.   Comparatively, in Sengkang, it is $2,500,  which  is\r\n\r\nmore  than  five times.  A fish stall is about $350-$650  per\r\n\r\nmonth.   Comparatively,  in Sengkang,  it  is  about  $3,000-$4,000.  So it is about six times.  For meat and poultry,  it\r\n\r\nis  about $288-$850 in Ang Mo Kio.  In Sengkang, it is  about\r\n\r\n$3,000-$3,500.  This is about four times, and so  on  and  so\r\n\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is not unexpected sometimes in new estates to\r\n\r\nexpect  an increase in prices.  But I think what has happened\r\n\r\nis that the scarcity of amenities and facilities has resulted\r\n\r\nin  these  high rents.  The unnecessary increase in  consumer\r\n\r\nprices made things very difficult for the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first like to thank the Minister for the support\r\n\r\ngiven  to the grassroots organisations with the formation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Sengkang Town Development Steering Committee.

Sectors such  as IT technology, e-commerce and\r\n\r\ntechnological   services  can  be  located   in   residential\r\n\r\npremises.   So  long  as  there is  a  desktop  computer,  PC\r\n\r\nsoftware  development and other business  activities  can  be\r\n\r\ncarried out.  In this respect, I would like the HDB to do the\r\n\r\nsame  by allowing HDB lessees to register their business  and\r\n\r\ncarry out certain commercial activities in their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflats.   Lessees and tenants should be allowed to  carry  out\r\n\r\ntheir  business from their flats, so long as these flats  are\r\n\r\nnot used as warehouses.

In\r\n\r\nSingapore, the MCD has done much to promote the establishment\r\n\r\nof  childcare  centres,  both at the  workplace  and  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.    Apart  from  the  quality  of  care   provided,\r\n\r\nconvenience of location is an important factor.  Best for the\r\n\r\nparents  are  childcare  centres  conveniently  sited  at   a\r\n\r\nlocation  near to home, often a HDB void deck, or a workplace\r\n\r\ncentre.   A  review  of workplace childcare  centres  reveals\r\n\r\nhowever that the majority are in Government agencies or  GLCs\r\n\r\nwith  large  manpower establishments.  This is not surprising\r\n\r\nas  it  makes little sense for a small company with  a  small\r\n\r\nstaff to set up a childcare centre of its own.  The economies\r\n\r\nof  scale to run such a centre are just not there to make the\r\n\r\nenterprise  viable  without  huge  subsidy,  something  small\r\n\r\ncompanies are generally not in a position to undertake.   The\r\n\r\nnumbers of staff benefitting are small.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no reason why, however, employees of many\r\n\r\ncompanies  sited  within  a  grouping  of  buildings  in   an\r\n\r\nindustrial,  business  or office complex  would  not  find  a\r\n\r\nchildcare centre conveniently located somewhere within the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncomplex  most useful.  Combined numbers make the  running  of\r\n\r\nsuch  an establishment by professional childcare operators  a\r\n\r\nviable  proposition.  This is not, however,  a  consideration\r\n\r\nthat  will occur to most developers and landlords and  if  it\r\n\r\ndid,  that  they  might  pay  any  attention  to.   Yet,  the\r\n\r\navailability  of  such  centres would be  another  small  but\r\n\r\neminently  integral piece of the jigsaw of measures  that  go\r\n\r\ntowards helping working parents cope with the demands of both\r\n\r\nwork and family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Minister therefore consider under National\r\n\r\nDevelopment's  planning requirements to require  the  setting\r\n\r\naside  of  space for a childcare centre or, better still,  in\r\n\r\nview  of  our  changing demographics, a multi-service  centre\r\n\r\nwhich  would  also  cater for day-care for the  elderly,  for\r\n\r\noffice,  business and industrial complexes beyond  a  certain\r\n\r\nsize?   In tandem with this requirement, of course,  we  will\r\n\r\nneed  to have the agreement of the authorities to exempt this\r\n\r\nsquare  footage set aside from the gross floor  area  in  the\r\n\r\ncalculation of the plot ratio.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> I would like to touch on affordability\r\n\r\nof  HDB  flats  for  Singaporeans.  I  think  the  Government\r\n\r\ndefines  affordability in relation to household income.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  also  come  out with  various  indexes,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  new flat affordability index, which is based  on  a\r\n\r\nratio of targetted percentile household income to the minimum\r\n\r\nqualifying  income needed to buy flats based on an affordable\r\n\r\nloan instalment pegged at about 40% of household income.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often we have heard in this House from the present\r\n\r\nMinister  and  the  past Minister, Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang,  that\r\n\r\nSingapore's HDB flats are affordable.  Yet, when we have  our\r\n\r\nconstituency  dialogues  with residents, many young  couples,\r\n\r\nmiddle  income families, always disagree with this  point  of\r\n\r\nview, and they say that they are finding it very difficult to\r\n\r\nafford  the  flat  that  they  have  or  aspired  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nslightly.    The   question  is  where   is   this   gap   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at it from a broader perspective, it is not\r\n\r\nsufficient to just define affordability by household  income.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  have moved from the 60s, 70s, to  80s  and  90s\r\n\r\nwhere, to some extent, the lifestyle changes and family  size\r\n\r\nhave to be taken into cognizance.  Because if you have two or\r\n\r\nthree  school going children, sometimes you find  that,  just\r\n\r\ntaking  a  household  income per se for a  husband  and  wife\r\n\r\nversus  somebody with three or four, or like Mr Ong Kian  Min\r\n\r\nwho has five children, it is going to be very difficult.   It\r\n\r\nis very difficult to therefore just base on household income.\r\n\r\nWe  are,  on  the  one hand, encouraging  our  middle  income\r\n\r\nfamilies to have more children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon said that our\r\n\r\nreproduction rates are not sufficiently high as  before.   If\r\n\r\nnot the lifestyle, we should particularly consider the family\r\n\r\nsize  in  deciding  this because the households  with  school\r\n\r\ngoing children face a lot of middle class squeeze, whether to\r\n\r\nsend their child to the childcare centre or whether it is the\r\n\r\nPCF  childcare centre which is available, if not, some church\r\n\r\nor  other  private  childcare centre.  It is  the  same  with\r\n\r\nkindergartens,  whether to send them to the  normal  schools,\r\n\r\nthe  autonomous or the independent schools, which are  a  bit\r\n\r\nmore  costly, and so on.  The list goes on.  We have to  take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration some of these facts because, whether  you\r\n\r\nlike  it  or  not, when your neighbour's kids or the  child's\r\n\r\nclassmate comes with $2 or $3 pocket money, you also have  to\r\n\r\ngive  your  child that $2 or $3.  Where does the  money  come\r\n\r\nfrom?   These  are the nuts and bolts issue that many  middle\r\n\r\nclass  families face in Singapore.  We should, in particular,\r\n\r\nif  not the lifestyle, take into consideration the number  of\r\n\r\nchildren  in  the house in determining affordability.   So  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask  the Minister to  seriously  review  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of \"affordability\" in this context.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee (West Coast):</b> Sir, it is an undeniable\r\n\r\nfact  that the HDB has a successful public housing programme,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the envy of many countries.  More than 85%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  live  in HDB flats and about 90%  own  their  own\r\n\r\nhomes.  I applaud the HDB in the effort to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nkeep  prices  of new HDB flats affordable.  However,  as  the\r\n\r\nstructure  of  the  economy and society changes,  and  at  an\r\n\r\nincreasing rate, with the power of information technology,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like the authority to constantly monitor the  equation\r\n\r\nbetween  price  and  affordability.  I fully  agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan that the current principle of keeping the  cost\r\n\r\nof  housing  at 40% of the household income may  need  to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed.  The household income might be the same but, as  Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan has said, the needs of each family can be quite\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 40% of the household income is a very blunt\r\n\r\ninstrument  to  determine affordability  of  the  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nEspecially in a knowledge-based economy, there will  be  some\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  will  lose out because of their  inability  to\r\n\r\ncope.   As a result, their  income level may fall below  that\r\n\r\nof  the  average household and the gap between the  different\r\n\r\nhousehold income groups could increase.  Similarly, while the\r\n\r\ntypical  household size is likely to decrease in the  future,\r\n\r\nthere  will still be families who cannot afford but  to  live\r\n\r\ntogether.  Households with low incomes and more members  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  find it very difficult to own their  home.   Would\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  look into the needs of such families  who  are\r\n\r\nfacing difficulties in owning their HDB flats?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I would like to raise a point\r\n\r\nregarding  the  pricing philosophy for HDB flats.   There  is\r\n\r\ncurrently  a  gap,  albeit not a serious  one,  in  terms  of\r\n\r\nexpectations  between buyers and HDB.  It  is  not  uncommon,\r\n\r\nespecially  during the crisis as well as during the  property\r\n\r\nmarket boom, for many HDB dwellers to express frustration and\r\n\r\nuncertainty over what they would actually pay for their flat.\r\n\r\nPart of this can be attributed to the queuing time which  can\r\n\r\nbe  inordinately long for the more popular zones.  Apart from\r\n\r\nthis,  there is also little or a direct reflection of pricing\r\n\r\nby, firstly, the location of the new flat and, secondly, on a\r\n\r\nper  square  metre or per square foot basis.  The  latter  is\r\n\r\nused  throughout  the  private housing  market  for  whatever\r\n\r\nbenchmarking it offers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the HDB, however, the emphasis is on room-type and\r\n\r\nalthough  most  Singaporeans understand the references  quite\r\n\r\nwell by now, a 3-room flat really has two bedrooms and both a\r\n\r\n4-room and a 5-room flat have only three bedrooms. Some  have\r\n\r\nexpressed  surprise  too that the new  5-room  flats  somehow\r\n\r\nappear or are in fact smaller than the older generation ones.\r\n\r\nThis  sense  of  being  shortchanged is misplaced  and  quite\r\n\r\nunnecessary.  Can the Minister reveal how the sense of  value\r\n\r\nfor  new  HDB  flats  can be properly  conveyed  to  would-be\r\n\r\nbuyers?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I echo Mrs Lim's\r\n\r\ndescription  of the problem concerning HDB flat prices.   Let\r\n\r\nme  just  illustrate the problem.  During the  onset  of  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  crisis, some applicants for HDB  Executive  flats,\r\n\r\nfor  example, were asked to select their flats based on  pre-crisis prices. This was in November 1997.  Even in March 1998\r\n\r\nwhen  they went to collect their keys and pay their 20%,  the\r\n\r\nprice   remained  unchanged.   But  last  year   when   these\r\n\r\napplicants moved in, they found to their surprise that prices\r\n\r\nhad  dropped  dramatically for the unsold flats.   The  price\r\n\r\ndrops  ranged  from  $30,000 to  as  much  as  $100,000.   In\r\n\r\npercentage terms, the range was from 15% to 35%.   Naturally,\r\n\r\nthe  flat owners who paid these high prices would, of course,\r\n\r\nlike  to  have their prices adjusted downwards to  reflect  a\r\n\r\nfairer  deal.   I  think  it is an example  of  the  lack  of\r\n\r\ncoincidence  between the expectation of  the  buyer  and  the\r\n\r\napproach by HDB.  After all, the point that many buyers  made\r\n\r\nis  that  HDB  has the monopoly as far as public  housing  is\r\n\r\nconcerned and potential owners do not really have the  luxury\r\n\r\nof choosing their time to purchase.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether it is not desirable for\r\n\r\nHDB  to   have  a fairly stable price structure whatever  the\r\n\r\nmarket  conditions are like, and whether in such an instance,\r\n\r\nHDB  could  consider adjusting the prices of those  affected,\r\n\r\nie,  the Executive flat owners who paid substantially  higher\r\n\r\nprices for their flats in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> The HDB upgrading programme has been\r\n\r\ngenerally well\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreceived   by  residents.   Most  residents  vote  for   this\r\n\r\nprogramme, pay their share of upgrading cost, are prepared to\r\n\r\nput  up with the inconvenience during the upgrading, and  are\r\n\r\nhappy with the outcome when the upgrading is finished.   Many\r\n\r\nsee  their  flat  values rise significantly after  upgrading.\r\n\r\nThe  only  source  of unhappiness and contention,  especially\r\n\r\nduring  the  upgrading, is the selection of the  space-adding\r\n\r\nitem  within their flat and the choice of finishing of  their\r\n\r\nflat.   Two  of my blocks in my constituency had  their  main\r\n\r\nupgrading  not  too  long  ago.   I  must  confess  that  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  within their flats caused quite  a  few  problems,\r\n\r\nwith  differing  views on the space adding items,  choice  of\r\n\r\ntiles,  leakage problems and some lack of cooperation on  the\r\n\r\npart of residents who refused entry to contractors to work in\r\n\r\ntheir flats for whatever reasons.  A few felt that they  were\r\n\r\nnot given what they wanted despite having to pay for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the question whether the HDB should be\r\n\r\ninvolved in the upgrading of the interior of HDB flats during\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Upgrading Programme.  Why do we not just focus  on\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading of the common areas at the precinct and  leave\r\n\r\nthe   renovation  of  the  inside  of  flats  to  the  owners\r\n\r\nthemselves?  Different households are at different stages  of\r\n\r\ntheir lives and have different needs and different capacities\r\n\r\nand resources to pay for them.  We should leave the upgrading\r\n\r\nof  the  interior  of flats to the owners to  allow  them  to\r\n\r\nmaximise  their economic utility and also help speed  up  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  process.  In my view, the main  upgrading  process\r\n\r\nnow  takes far too long, in fact, long enough for you to pull\r\n\r\ndown  the entire block and rebuild.  I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\nreview this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, our Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  carrying on these Interim Upgrading Programme and  Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading   Programme  with  the  view   of   improving   the\r\n\r\nenvironment  and providing better service to  the  residents.\r\n\r\nWith  this ageing population, I think the most important item\r\n\r\nin  the upgrading programme is to improve the service of  the\r\n\r\nlifts.  In the older HDB estates, lifts do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  stop  at every floor.  For those who are living  in  the\r\n\r\nhigh  floor,  particularly the senior citizens,  it  is  very\r\n\r\ninconvenient.   HDB understands this problem.  Therefore,  in\r\n\r\nthe  new flats, the design is such that the lifts would  stop\r\n\r\nat  every  floor.   They provide very  good  service  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents, particularly the senior citizens, and this has won\r\n\r\nthe praises of the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have about 280,000 people aged 60 years and above.\r\n\r\n90%  of them are staying in HDB flats.  Every day, they  have\r\n\r\nto  make use of the lifts to go upstairs and downstairs.   If\r\n\r\nthe lifts do not stop at the floor on which they are staying,\r\n\r\nthey  would  have  to walk up one or two floors  before  they\r\n\r\ncould  use  the  lifts.  To the young  people,  there  is  no\r\n\r\nproblem.   But for the old people, particularly those who are\r\n\r\nnot feeling well, it poses a problem.  On one occasion, I met\r\n\r\nan  old man who was sitting at the ground floor of the  flat,\r\n\r\nwaiting  for his son to come back to help him to go upstairs.\r\n\r\nHe said he could not walk up.  I asked him how  he managed to\r\n\r\ncome down.  He told me in Teochew, \"My legs are not listening\r\n\r\nto me.  I can walk down but I cannot walk up.\"  I came across\r\n\r\na  newspaper  report that when a person  gets  old  his  most\r\n\r\nvulnerable part is his legs.  They would not be able to  walk\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, I am living in an HDB estate and work very\r\n\r\nclosely  with the residents.  I understand the problems  they\r\n\r\nare  facing,  and  their needs.  I feel  that  improving  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  the  lifts  is the most important  item  in  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  projects.   I  think the  lifts  and  the  covered\r\n\r\nwalkways are the two most important and most frequently  used\r\n\r\nfacilities in the HDB estates.  HDB should seriously consider\r\n\r\ninstalling  new  lifts with landing on every  floor  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit of  the residents, particularly the senior citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered that some Interim Upgrading Programmes have\r\n\r\nnot included the improvement to the lifts.  The residents are\r\n\r\nvery disappointed with it.  HDB rules that improvement to the\r\n\r\nlifts  would  only  be  carried out  in  the  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgramme.   For  some estates, after the  IUP  projects  are\r\n\r\nimplemented, the residents have to wait for some 10 years, or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  longer for the MUP projects.  I think this is too long,\r\n\r\nparticularly for the old people.  They may not be around when\r\n\r\nthe lifts are eventually improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we can give this matter more urgency. As\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister has said, we have a budget  surplus  of\r\n\r\n$3.2  billion.  I think we should set aside $300  million  to\r\n\r\nhelp HDB in improving the lift service for the benefit of the\r\n\r\n280,000 senior citizens in our population.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, since 1992, selected old HDB\r\n\r\nflats  have  been  undergoing  upgrading  through  the   Main\r\n\r\nUpgrading  and  the  Interim  Upgrading  programmes.    These\r\n\r\nprogrammes  are highly popular with the residents since  they\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about  new facilities  and  amenities  in  the\r\n\r\nprecinct  as well as an enhancement in the value of the  flat\r\n\r\nin  this  resale market.  The benefits to the  residents  are\r\n\r\nimmense.   Covered linkways provide shelter; communal  places\r\n\r\nallow  residents  to  interact with  one  another;  and,  the\r\n\r\nupgraded  lift lobbies and common areas make the  place  look\r\n\r\nmore attractive.  I therefore would like to congratulate  the\r\n\r\nHDB  and  the  Town  Councils for doing a  wonderful  job  in\r\n\r\ncreating  a  higher quality living environment  for  our  HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the financial crisis behind us, may I urge the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  accelerate the upgrading  programmes.   Besides\r\n\r\nbenefiting the residents, these upgrading projects will  also\r\n\r\nprovide opportunities for the construction sector to speed up\r\n\r\nits recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the HDB upgrading programmes, ie,\r\n\r\nMUP  and  IUP,  are  implemented in phases.   Each  upgrading\r\n\r\nprecinct  comprises between five and 10 blocks.  Very  often,\r\n\r\ncovered  linkways are designed to link blocks  together,  and\r\n\r\nfrom  blocks  to  bus-stops  or  other  amenities.   But  the\r\n\r\nMinistry does not allow the MUP or IUP budget to be used  for\r\n\r\ncovered  linkways  beyond the upgrading precinct.   As  such,\r\n\r\ncovered  linkways  are  sometimes not  completely  linked  to\r\n\r\nblocks or public\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\namenities  to  provide a seamless connection  for  residents.\r\n\r\nThis  is  especially so when the linkway  spans  across  land\r\n\r\nparcels belonging to different authorities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some MUP and IUP, certain infrastructure works\r\n\r\nbelonging to HDB, such as access road and car park,  are  not\r\n\r\nupgraded  during the upgrading programme.  This has  affected\r\n\r\nthe overall rejuvenation of the upgraded precinct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The upgraded precinct with its new facilities, such as\r\n\r\nlift  stopping at every landing, will also increase the  cost\r\n\r\nof  maintenance for Town Councils.  Sir, I wish to  make  the\r\n\r\nfollowing suggestions for the Minister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Provide additional budget for covered linkways\r\n\r\nwhich  link  upgraded  precincts to  buildings  or  amenities\r\n\r\noutside the upgraded precinct boundary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Coordinate with LTA, ENV and Land Office to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  linkways  can  be  constructed to  bus-stops  or  other\r\n\r\namenities during upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide a budget to provide anti-mosquito breeding\r\n\r\nfeatures  to be incorporated in the upgrading precinct,  such\r\n\r\nas clothes hanging poles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Provide a budget for HDB to upgrade car parks and\r\n\r\naccess roads of upgrading precinct during MUP and IUP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Provide a grant for Town Councils to bring forward\r\n\r\ncyclical  works  of  upgrading precinct  so  as  to  minimise\r\n\r\ninconvenience to residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Provide a special grant to Town Councils, which\r\n\r\nhave blocks with lifts stopping at every floor landing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, many of our older\r\n\r\nHDB  flats  are now undergoing upgrading.  Most of them  were\r\n\r\nbuilt  some 20-over years ago when the problem of  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  was not an issue.  In these estates, some  blocks\r\n\r\nhave lifts and some do not.  Even for those\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  lifts, the lifts do not land on every floor.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nfor this special type of flats known as segmented blocks, the\r\n\r\nresidents  would  have to walk a distance  along  the  public\r\n\r\ncorridor on the lift-landing floor before walking up or  down\r\n\r\nthe stairs to their respective flats. To the senior citizens,\r\n\r\nthe problem is aggravated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to commend Minister Mah Bow Tan for making\r\n\r\nthe  decision to  allow the lifts to stop at every floor, and\r\n\r\nfor building additional lifts in some of the older blocks.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to urge HDB to provide these facilities  for  all\r\n\r\nthe blocks in order to look after the ageing population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the following years, I think there will be more\r\n\r\nproblems with the lifts in the older estates.  In fact,  from\r\n\r\nwhat I know, some people have to upgrade simply  because they\r\n\r\nare  fed  up  with  the inadequacy  of the  lift  service  at\r\n\r\ntheir old flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the lifts in the upgrading precinct, there are\r\n\r\nstill  other problems to be resolved.  Who is going to  share\r\n\r\nin  the  cost  and who can vote and who cannot vote,  or  can\r\n\r\neveryone  vote?   This issue has not been resolved.   I  feel\r\n\r\nthat we need some specific ruling on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chee Wee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chee Wee (Boon Lay):</b> Sir, I would like to thank\r\n\r\nHDB  and the Government for the upgrading programmes.  We saw\r\n\r\n4,900 units of flats in my constituency, Boon Lay, benefiting\r\n\r\nor  about  to  benefit from the Interim  and  Main  Upgrading\r\n\r\nProgrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For older constituencies like Boon Lay, most if not all\r\n\r\nof  the  flats are eligible for main upgrading.  But being  a\r\n\r\nnation-wide  programme, upgrading could  only  proceed  at  a\r\n\r\ncertain  pace.  So, many residents are therefore afraid  that\r\n\r\nit will take quite some years before their turn for upgrading\r\n\r\nof flats will come.  Some of the older ones wonder whether if\r\n\r\nthey will live long enough to see the upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I share the sentiments expressed by the earlier\r\n\r\nspeaker,  Dr  Wan  Soon Bee.  And I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister,  in view of the economic recovery and the  stronger\r\n\r\nfinancial position, and, in fact, larger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsurpluses  accumulated by the Government, whether  HDB  could\r\n\r\naccelerate these upgrading programmes so that more  of  those\r\n\r\nwho  live  in  the  older  estates  could  benefit  from  the\r\n\r\nprogramme early.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, on HDB\r\n\r\nupgrading, I recall that on 7th March, during the  debate  on\r\n\r\nthe  financial  policy of the Government,  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance, in reply to questions on the budget surpluses,  said\r\n\r\nand  I  quote:  \"Who is the Government?   The  money  in  the\r\n\r\nreserves  is yours.  What is the Government?  The  Government\r\n\r\nrepresents the people.  The Frontbench and the Ministers  are\r\n\r\njust your agents holding the money.\"  The Minister spoke with\r\n\r\njustification and good reasons.  But the more I think of  it,\r\n\r\nthe  more I become doubtful.  The Government's money  belongs\r\n\r\nto the people.  But it is for the Government to decide how to\r\n\r\nspend  it.  The ruling Party, the PAP, is using the  people's\r\n\r\nmoney  to  threaten the people by saying that if you  do  not\r\n\r\nvote  for the PAP, you would not get the benefit of upgrading\r\n\r\nfunded by the Government with the people's money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance said time and again that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  represents  the  people.   Since  the  Government\r\n\r\nrepresents  the people, it should be fair to all  the  people\r\n\r\nalike.   But  the  scheduling of the upgrading  programme  is\r\n\r\nbased  on  the  election results.  In  the  PAP  wards,  some\r\n\r\nestates  which  are not very old have already been  upgraded.\r\n\r\nBut  in my Hougang constituency, some older flats in the  old\r\n\r\nPunggol  estate are already more than 23 years old,  yet  the\r\n\r\nturn  has  not  come  for  them to be  upgraded.   Since  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's money is the people's money, why is it that  the\r\n\r\npeople  in  the Opposition wards do not have a share  in  it?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the PAP Government does not regard the people in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition wards as their people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general election, Prime Minister Goh Chok\r\n\r\nTong even went to the extent of saying that the flats in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition wards might become slums one day.  These are words\r\n\r\ncoming  out from the mouth of the Prime Minister.  I am  very\r\n\r\nsurprised.  When I referred to the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nupgrading  issue  in  Parliament, the Minister  for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment said that it was not possible to upgrade all  the\r\n\r\nflats  at the same time.  The Opposition wards must queue  up\r\n\r\nat  the  end.  But now the situation is that the flats  which\r\n\r\nare  less  than  10  years old in the PAP wards  are  already\r\n\r\nupgraded, while flats which are more than 20 years old in the\r\n\r\nHougang constituency have not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can anticipate the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\ntelling  me that there is a difference between IUP  and  MUP.\r\n\r\nBe  that as it may, the people in Hougang can suffer a little\r\n\r\nbit of disadvantage.  The Government can just provide IUP  to\r\n\r\nthese flats that are more than 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this policy of two different kinds of\r\n\r\nupgrading  is that flats in Hougang which are older  than  20\r\n\r\nyears  are  not  upgraded, but flats in other  constituencies\r\n\r\nwhich  are  less  than  10  years  old   are  upgraded.    My\r\n\r\nconclusion is that the Minister's explanation that it is  not\r\n\r\npossible  to  have  all the estates upgraded  does  not  hold\r\n\r\nwater.   What  the PAP Government really meant was  that  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  wards  would have to wait  till  what  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  said  at  the last election that \"opposition  wards\r\n\r\nwill become slums\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as the Prime Minister has said, one fine day the\r\n\r\nOpposition ward does become a slum, compared to other  wards,\r\n\r\nthis  will be the desired outcome of the PAP in consolidating\r\n\r\nthe  hold  of its power and an achievement of Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  during  his term of office!  By then, I  wonder  if  the\r\n\r\nCabinet,  which  the Minister for Finance  described  as  the\r\n\r\ncustodian of the people's money, will feel proud of the slums\r\n\r\namong them in the so-called Singapore 21 vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me thank all the Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken.   I  am  grateful to them for keeping their  speeches\r\n\r\nshort.  Because I have got a fairly long agenda to take  care\r\n\r\nof,  I  need a bit more time.  Thank you very much, first  of\r\n\r\nall, to the Members who have spoken on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Concept Plan review.  This is a subject that I will first\r\n\r\ntouch upon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau, Mr Ong Kian Min, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan,  in particular, spoke about the  Concept  Plan\r\n\r\nreview  and  asked  questions regarding the upcoming  Concept\r\n\r\nPlan review, and also raised several questions pertaining  to\r\n\r\nthat review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the issues raised are indeed being studied\r\n\r\nas  part  of  this current Concept Plan review.  The  Concept\r\n\r\nPlan  is  a  blue-print which guides our planners in  shaping\r\n\r\nSingapore's physical development to make Singapore a thriving\r\n\r\nworld-class city, a city which Singaporeans can be  proud  to\r\n\r\ncall their home and, of course, to make it a livable city and\r\n\r\nattractive city so that foreigners want to come here to live,\r\n\r\nwork and even settle down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Concept Plan review, the starting point is to\r\n\r\ndecide,  first  of all, on what is our long-term  population,\r\n\r\nwhat  planning  parameters do we use for population,  because\r\n\r\nthis  decides  how  much  we  set aside  for  infrastructure,\r\n\r\nservices, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1991 Concept Plan, the figure that we used for\r\n\r\nplanning  purposes was four million.  The focus then  was  on\r\n\r\nthe  indigenous and the resident population and that included\r\n\r\nof course PRs.  Since then, we have attracted more employment\r\n\r\npass  and work permit holders in order to support the growing\r\n\r\neconomy.  As a result of this, the total population has grown\r\n\r\nrapidly  from three million in 1990, when we were  doing  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Concept Plan, to about 3.9 million.  So  obviously,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to update our original 1991 Concept Plan population\r\n\r\nof four million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this review, we are adopting a long-term population\r\n\r\nfigure  of  5.5  million.  This includes citizens,  permanent\r\n\r\nresidents,  employment pass as well as work  permit  holders.\r\n\r\nBy  long term, I am talking about some time in the middle  of\r\n\r\nthis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentury,  2040-2050, because that is the  long-term  planning\r\n\r\nhorizon  when we are talking about land use.  But  this  does\r\n\r\nnot, in any way, suggest that Singapore can only support  5.5\r\n\r\nmillion people.  Indeed, it would be very difficult for us at\r\n\r\nthis  point in time to know or to project what life is  going\r\n\r\nto  be like in 40 or 50 years' time. With further advances in\r\n\r\ntechnology,    information   technology,   telecommunications\r\n\r\ntechnology,   reclamation  technology,  building  technology,\r\n\r\ntransportation  technology, we may be  able  to  plan  for  a\r\n\r\npopulation larger than 5.5 million in future.  But,  at  this\r\n\r\npoint  in  time, for this current review, this is the  number\r\n\r\nthat we are looking at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our limited land space is a given in this exercise\r\n\r\nand  we  need  to  optimise  the  use  of  our  limited  land\r\n\r\nresources,  as  Mr  Lew,  Mr Sinnakaruppan  and  others  have\r\n\r\npointed  out.   In  order  to  effectively  accommodate  more\r\n\r\npeople,  in order to provide more commercial, industrial  and\r\n\r\nrecreational space, we would have to optimise or maximise the\r\n\r\nuse of this limited land.  This means building upwards, high-rise  residential  apartments, commercial  towers,  high-rise\r\n\r\nflatted factories, and so on.  HDB has announced that it will\r\n\r\nbe  building its first 40-storey block in Toa Payoh.  If  the\r\n\r\nresponse is good, HDB will build more where it is possible to\r\n\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uses that cannot go high rise are located where there\r\n\r\nare  height constraints.  In Singapore, there are many places\r\n\r\nwhere  buildings cannot go up beyond a certain height because\r\n\r\nof  the  height constraints, airspace constraint, and so  on.\r\n\r\nPollutive  industries would be grouped together  to  minimise\r\n\r\nthe  constraints  they  impose  on  their  surroundings,  ie,\r\n\r\nsewerage  treatment  plants  and noise  polluting  industries\r\n\r\nwhere  buffers  are required by law in order to  protect  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.  These would be located together so  that  their\r\n\r\nbuffers will cancel one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leisure and recreational facilities, such as golf\r\n\r\ncourses,  would  be  located within  water  catchment  areas.\r\n\r\nAgain,  this  is  so  as not to use up additional  land.   If\r\n\r\nnecessary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  if possible, we will put some of our infrastructure  and\r\n\r\nservices  underground.  The Environment Ministry is  starting\r\n\r\nwork  on  the deep tunnel sewerage system.  Mindef is looking\r\n\r\nat   underground  ammunition  dumps,  or  ammunition  storage\r\n\r\ndepots.   We  will  encourage the co-location  of  compatible\r\n\r\nuses.  Mr Ong Kian Min mentioned just now the possibility  of\r\n\r\nproviding  recreational or eating facilities  in  our  parks.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed being done and some of our parks are already\r\n\r\nhost  to  very thriving, very successful and very  attractive\r\n\r\neating places,  for example, the Botanic Gardens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we can also cluster different uses together.\r\n\r\nCommunity   facilities,   such  as  community   centres   and\r\n\r\nlibraries, can be clustered together.  This in fact is  being\r\n\r\ndone  now,  the  first one being the Marine Parade  community\r\n\r\ncentre in the Prime Minister's constituency.  By doing it  in\r\n\r\nthis  way,  by imaginative and creative use of land,  or  co-location  of such facilities, we can save as much as  40%  of\r\n\r\nthe  land  compared to the situation where we have  to  build\r\n\r\nthem separately.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must also be realistic. There is, at the end of\r\n\r\nthe  day, a limited amount of land that we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  notwithstanding the many areas and many ways in which  we\r\n\r\ncan  optimise land use, at the end of the day, we would still\r\n\r\nneed  to make very difficult trade-offs in planning our  land\r\n\r\nuse.   For example, we would have to decide how much land  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  set aside for housing, and for a better quality  of\r\n\r\nlife,  how  much green space to set aside and, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  how much industrial land we need to set aside in order\r\n\r\nto  attract industries, investments and dollars to create the\r\n\r\njobs  that  will fuel economic growth.  These  are  difficult\r\n\r\ndecisions.   Ultimately, the Government would  have  to  make\r\n\r\nthese  decisions.   But in arriving at these  decisions,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  would involve as many people as possible  in  the\r\n\r\nplanning process.  Not only do we let people have a say,  but\r\n\r\nI  think  it  is  also  good  to let  people  understand  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  that are faced in arriving at  such  decisions.\r\n\r\nCollectively, Sir, we will have to determine the kind of city\r\n\r\nwe want for ourselves and future generations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come now to a basic concern of many Members, which is\r\n\r\nhousing.   Do  we  have enough land for housing?   The  short\r\n\r\nanswer is yes.  Even for a population planning target of  5.5\r\n\r\nmillion,  let  me  assure the House that  there  will  be  no\r\n\r\nshortage  of  land for housing.  We have one million  housing\r\n\r\nunits today spread over 10,000 hectares of land.  A total  of\r\n\r\n16,400  hectares  of land have been safeguarded  for  housing\r\n\r\nover  the  long  term.  This is sufficient  to  house  a  5.5\r\n\r\nmillion population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For private housing, since 1990, the Government has\r\n\r\nsystematically  injected more housing units into  the  market\r\n\r\nthrough the Government land sales programme.  And as a result\r\n\r\nof  this, the proportion of private to pubic housing  in  the\r\n\r\nhousing  stock  has risen steadily from 14% in  1990  to  18%\r\n\r\ntoday.   This  is going to increase even further  because  we\r\n\r\nrecognise  that  we have to cater for a population  which  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  affluent, which will have higher  aspirations\r\n\r\nfor  more  exclusive housing types and are prepared,  willing\r\n\r\nand  able  to  pay  for  them.  But at  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will continue to build sufficient public  housing\r\n\r\nto cater to the majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For planning purposes, MND will adopt the housing mix of\r\n\r\n75:25,  in other words, 75% public, 25% private.  But let  me\r\n\r\njust  say that we cannot cast these plans in stone.  We  have\r\n\r\nto  take into account the changing tastes of the market.   We\r\n\r\nmust  be flexible in order to accommodate any changes in  the\r\n\r\nmarketplace.  While this would be the planning  norm  in  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  Concept  Plan review, the situation  may  change  in\r\n\r\nsubsequent plans.  But for this particular purpose,  we  feel\r\n\r\nthat this is a realistic and reasonable mix to plan for.   We\r\n\r\nwill  monitor the market closely and we will have  to  adjust\r\n\r\nthe public housing as well as the land sales programme as  we\r\n\r\ngo  along  in order to meet the changing aspirations  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the quantitative aspect of the housing and land\r\n\r\nuse  problems.  But even as our planners strive to meet these\r\n\r\nquantitative aspects of housing and other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeds, they would also do well not to neglect the qualitative\r\n\r\naspect  of  our  built  environment.  Our  existing  planning\r\n\r\nsystem   has  facilitated  the  development  of  a  generally\r\n\r\nefficient,  safe  and attractive urban  environment.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink we can do more to enhance Singapore's attractiveness as\r\n\r\na city.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the design quality of our buildings improves and as\r\n\r\nour  construction industry matures, URA has also relaxed  and\r\n\r\nreduced  its development controls and urban design guidelines\r\n\r\nover  the next few years.  URA will explore various  ways  to\r\n\r\nfurther  facilitate and encourage creative developments.   It\r\n\r\nwill review the existing development control and urban design\r\n\r\nguidelines,  for  example, those  that  pertain  to  the  key\r\n\r\ndistricts, such as the Civic District, the Historic District,\r\n\r\nthe  Central  Business District and the  tourist  belt  along\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road.   All  these can be made  known.   Architects,\r\n\r\ndesigners  and  planners will then know what  areas  need  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with the guidelines.  And outside of these areas,  we\r\n\r\ncan  afford  to  be a bit more relaxed and  only  apply  very\r\n\r\nminimal urban design guidelines.  In this way, we hope to  be\r\n\r\nable to encourage more creativity and more innovation in  the\r\n\r\ndesign of the built environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that URA intends to do is to establish an\r\n\r\ninternational  advisory panel to provide  ideas  on  planning\r\n\r\nstrategies  and proposals.  URA is already currently  engaged\r\n\r\nwith  international  experts.  But they hope  that  they  can\r\n\r\nformalise  this through the formation of such a  panel  which\r\n\r\nwill comprise eminent experts from all over the world.  After\r\n\r\nall,  we  do  aspire  to  be  a global  world-class  city  of\r\n\r\nexcellence.    But   we   need  to  also   complement   their\r\n\r\ncontributions  with those of our local experts.   Conferences\r\n\r\nand  workshops  will be organised to raise  the  standard  of\r\n\r\nlocal   design   and  also  to  promote,  very   importantly,\r\n\r\nappreciation by the public, the owners and developers of what\r\n\r\nconstitute good and creative designs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan review is an exciting and a very\r\n\r\nimportant  exercise.  We will be entering soon a phase  which\r\n\r\nallows  the  URA  to involve the public in  various  planning\r\n\r\nissues  and  the  Concept Plan will be finalised  after  such\r\n\r\nconsultation exercises.  This public consultation  will  take\r\n\r\nplace at different levels.  There will be small focused group\r\n\r\nsessions with the professionals and informed members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  to  discuss issues and trade-offs that are  faced  in\r\n\r\nland use planning.  On a larger scale, public exhibitions  of\r\n\r\nthe  plan  will  be held next year.  Again, this  is  another\r\n\r\nopportunity for the public to comment and to give feedback on\r\n\r\nthese  plans.  With the participation of the public and  with\r\n\r\nURA's  proactive strategies, I am confident that we  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to  make Singapore a thriving world-class city  in  the\r\n\r\n21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me now to address some of the specific issues\r\n\r\nthat  were  raised by the Members just now.  Mr Lew  Syn  Pau\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we  allow  a higher  plot  ratio  for  prime\r\n\r\nresidential land in order to allow more people to live in the\r\n\r\nprime areas.  Sir, this does make good economic sense and, as\r\n\r\nfar  as possible, this would be done, as indeed, it is  being\r\n\r\ndone today.  But he would also agree that not every piece  of\r\n\r\nland can support a higher plot ratio.  There will be limiting\r\n\r\nconstraints  and factors, such as height constraints  imposed\r\n\r\nby   flight  paths,  as  well  as  capacity  constraints   of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure, or services, like roads, sewerage, etc.   But\r\n\r\nas far as possible, this is something that will be done.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, along the same lines, spoke about the\r\n\r\nneed  to  bring more life into the Central Business District,\r\n\r\nsuch  as Raffles Place. I agree with Mr Ong.  Our CBD can  be\r\n\r\nbetter  utilised.   In  fact, we have  gradually  started  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  mixed use and residential developments  to  create\r\n\r\nmore  life  and vibrancy in the CBD after office  hours.  For\r\n\r\nexample, if you take the Boat Quay development, when you look\r\n\r\nout  of Parliament House, you will agree, if you are here  in\r\n\r\nthe  evenings,  how vibrant and how noisy  it  is.  Fullerton\r\n\r\nHotel is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndevelopment that has been awarded to a developer to create  a\r\n\r\ntop-class hotel and I believe that will also bring life  into\r\n\r\nthe  city.   Far  East Square is another  example.   For  our\r\n\r\nfuture downtown at Marina South, we will be zoning more sites\r\n\r\nas  white sites.  What these white sites allow developers  to\r\n\r\ndo  is  to  give them flexibility to plan for wider range  of\r\n\r\nuses so as not be constrained by URA guideplans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min and Dr Teo Ho Pin spoke about planning\r\n\r\nfor the aged. Yes, this is going to become more important  as\r\n\r\nour   population   ages.   I  chaired  the  Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee  last  year to look at the problems  of  an  ageing\r\n\r\npopulation  and  the  Committee  came  up  with  a   set   of\r\n\r\nrecommendations including the need to cater for  the  elderly\r\n\r\nin  our  built  environment  and the  need  to  provide  more\r\n\r\nfacilities  such  as  nursing homes,  aged  homes  and  other\r\n\r\nsupport  facilities. URA and HDB will work together with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health and the Ministry of Community Development\r\n\r\nand  Sports to ensure that sufficient land is set  aside  for\r\n\r\nsuch uses. The Land Transport Authority has also factored the\r\n\r\ntransportation needs of the elderly into its plans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked how we provide greenery within our\r\n\r\nbuilt  environment. We have, within our residential  estates,\r\n\r\nprovided a variety of parks and common green, as well as park\r\n\r\nconnectors  and these will form the green link between  parks\r\n\r\nwhich  is  useful  to enhance the quality of  life.  Finally,\r\n\r\nthere  was the question about how we can factor IT  into  our\r\n\r\ncommercial developments. Yes, this is an important aspect  of\r\n\r\nthe  review  and  what the review will do  is  to  take  into\r\n\r\nconsideration  the  rapid  technological  changes  and  their\r\n\r\nimpact  on the way we live, work and play.  This would impact\r\n\r\nultimately  on  the  amount of land that  we  set  aside  for\r\n\r\nindustry and commercial developments, etc.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered all the relevant questions on\r\n\r\nthe  Concept  Plan  review.  May I now  respond  to  Members'\r\n\r\nquestions  on public housing.  But before I do so,  first  of\r\n\r\nall,  I  would  like  to remind the House  that  the  HDB  is\r\n\r\ncelebrating its 40th anniversary this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB was set up in 1960 to solve Singapore's housing\r\n\r\nproblems.  At  that  time  in  1960,  less  than  9%  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation lived in low-cost housing.  The majority lived  in\r\n\r\nslums  and squatter colonies. Today, 40 years later, as  many\r\n\r\nMembers have pointed out, it is 86% of our population  living\r\n\r\nin  HDB  flats,  and 9 out of 10 HDB dwellers own  their  own\r\n\r\nflats.   And  over these years, public housing has  developed\r\n\r\nfrom  the  very  basic, spartan low-cost housing  units  into\r\n\r\nhomes  and communities that our citizens are proud  of.   HDB\r\n\r\nflats   are   spacious,   comfortable,   well-furnished   and\r\n\r\naffordable and provide residents with clean and secure  homes\r\n\r\nwithin self-contained communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing programme is one of Singapore's\r\n\r\nenduring success stories.  It has given Singaporeans a  stake\r\n\r\nin  the nation. It has contributed to social stability in our\r\n\r\nnation-building process.  When you talk about  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartbeat,  if  you want to find the Singapore heartbeat,  go\r\n\r\ndown to the HDB's heartlands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore owes a deep debt of gratitude to many men and\r\n\r\nwomen  of  HDB  who  have  made this possible,  led  by  many\r\n\r\ndistinguished Chairmen, including the first Chairman, Mr  Lim\r\n\r\nKim  San, Mr Howe Yoon Chong, Mr Lee Hee Seng, Mr Michael Fam\r\n\r\nand Mr Hsuan Owyang. Some time this year, HDB will be handing\r\n\r\nover the keys to the 800,000th family. This is indeed a great\r\n\r\nachievement.   I  have  asked HDB to  organise  an  event  to\r\n\r\ncommemorate this significant milestone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On specific issues raised by Members, Mr Sinnakaruppan\r\n\r\nmade  a very interesting suggestion and I think I should take\r\n\r\nhis  suggestion  first.  He asked whether the  Government  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  introduce  more  competition  into  the  public\r\n\r\nhousing  arena.  He did not use the term, but I presume  that\r\n\r\nhe meant a HDB 2 because he still wants to have all the rules\r\n\r\nand regulations and subsidies associated with public housing.\r\n\r\nOver  the  past  40 years, HDB has accumulated  a  wealth  of\r\n\r\nexperience  in  public  housing  and  the  Member  would  not\r\n\r\ndisagree  with me that this, together with the  economies  of\r\n\r\nscale of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuilding  so  many  public housing  units,  has  enabled  the\r\n\r\nHousing  and Development Board to keep development  cost  low\r\n\r\nand housing quality high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our public housing is held in great esteem and regard by\r\n\r\nmany  countries and I do not mean just developing  countries.\r\n\r\nMembers  who have visited the HDB, the Ministry and Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom the developed countries are equally amazed at how we are\r\n\r\nable, not just to develop and build, but also to maintain and\r\n\r\nkeep HDB housing to the highest quality and standards.  I was\r\n\r\nin  Hong Kong recently. I went there to look at their  public\r\n\r\nhousing and they were quite frank in telling me that a lot of\r\n\r\nideas  were actually adapted from Singapore, and  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nSingapore's  HDB  did  the  same.   There  is  a  wealth   of\r\n\r\nexperience built into this and this is manifested in the kind\r\n\r\nof public housing we have today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we move quickly into carving out HDB into two, or\r\n\r\neven three blocks and get them to compete with each other, we\r\n\r\nshould  pause a while and consider the implications of  this.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there is a valid point in the sense that we\r\n\r\nshould  try as much as possible to involve the private sector\r\n\r\nin  schemes to build and upgrade public housing.  There is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  between doing that and what the Member suggested,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  to create a competitor to HDB. How does Government\r\n\r\ndo   this   at  the  moment?   Through  the  design-and-build\r\n\r\nprogramme,  the  Main and Interim Upgrading  programmes,  the\r\n\r\nExecutive Condominium scheme and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am hesitant to talk about a HDB 2, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  I  must tell the Member that we are always looking  at\r\n\r\nways   to   engage  the  private  sector  in  public  housing\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and  projects and if there is an area  where  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  can do a better job than the public  sector,\r\n\r\nthen  I agree that we should give them the opportunity to  do\r\n\r\nso.   I  do not see the need for Government to set up another\r\n\r\nagency at this stage to compete with HDB or to privatise HDB.\r\n\r\nWe should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  lose  sight of the fact that a major component of  HDB's\r\n\r\nmission  is  not  about building flats.  It is  about  social\r\n\r\ncohesion  and  community  bonding.  Those  are  things  which\r\n\r\ncannot  be easily measured in terms which the private  sector\r\n\r\nunderstands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, like Mr Sinnakaruppan, Dr Wan Soon Boon,\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim Hwee Hua and Prof. Chin, amongst others, have spoken\r\n\r\nabout  the question of affordability of HDB flats.   Let  me,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all,  explain  to Members  how  and  what  is  the\r\n\r\nrationale  behind Government's pricing policy of  HDB  flats.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all,  the Government is committed to  keeping  the\r\n\r\nprices  of  HDB  flats affordable to the Singapore  citizens,\r\n\r\nespecially to first-timers and to lower-income families.  How\r\n\r\nis  this  done?   By  pricing HDB  flats  such  that  90%  of\r\n\r\nSingaporean households can afford at least a 3-room flat, and\r\n\r\n70% at least a 4-room flat.  5-room flats and Executive flats\r\n\r\nwhich  HDB  used to build in the past but which they  do  not\r\n\r\nanymore,  are  additional choices for those  households  with\r\n\r\nhigher  incomes.  In line with these principles, smaller  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  are generally given more subsidy.  HDB does not follow\r\n\r\nthe  private  sector's practice of pricing  its  flats  on  a\r\n\r\ndollar per square metre or dollar per-square-foot basis which\r\n\r\nis  what Mrs Lim Hwee Hua was suggesting just now.  If we did\r\n\r\nso,  then the differences between large and small flats would\r\n\r\nbe  blurred.   I  do not think this is the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nHDB's  pricing  policy.  This explains  why  the  dollar  per\r\n\r\nsquare metre of Executive flats, for example, is higher  than\r\n\r\nthat  of 5-room flats, 5-room flat per-square-metre is higher\r\n\r\nthan  4-room,  and so on. And because of these  affordability\r\n\r\ncriteria, 9 out of 10 HDB dwellers today own their own homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan Soon Bee mentioned the 40% of household income\r\n\r\nthat  is being used to determine maximum loan quantum,  which\r\n\r\nin  turn determines whether a person can afford a HDB flat or\r\n\r\nnot.   If  you take the average HDB flat prices, the  average\r\n\r\nmonthly mortgage instalment for a HDB flat as a percentage of\r\n\r\nhis  monthly household income, is way below the 40% criterion\r\n\r\nof  a  purchaser's household income.  Dr Wan can be reassured\r\n\r\nthat the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n40% is not a limiting factor in terms of pricing and allowing\r\n\r\nHDB flat dwellers to own their own homes.  In fact, what that\r\n\r\nmeans  is  that  most HDB flat dwellers are able  to  service\r\n\r\ntheir  mortgage  loans entirely with their CPF contributions.\r\n\r\nTo  another question posed by another Member, there are  very\r\n\r\nfew  HDB dwellers who do not pay their HDB mortgages in time.\r\n\r\nFor  4-room flats, the mortgage instalments are roughly about\r\n\r\n18%  of  the  applicant's household income;  and  for  5-room\r\n\r\nflats, around the same, 19% of the household income. This  is\r\n\r\nthe amount of money that HDB dwellers pay as a percentage  of\r\n\r\ntheir total household income, way below the 40% limit that Dr\r\n\r\nWan was talking about just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan then posed another interesting\r\n\r\nproposition. He asked whether HDB can consider lifestyle  and\r\n\r\nfamily size in the setting of flat prices for HDB. This is  a\r\n\r\nvery  novel suggestion but this is going to send a very wrong\r\n\r\nsignal  to  the people concerned.  If we take that suggestion\r\n\r\nseriously,  the  logical conclusion is  that  there  must  be\r\n\r\ndifferent flat prices for different families.  If you have  a\r\n\r\nlarge  family,  you  have one price.  If  you  have  a  small\r\n\r\nfamily,  you  have a different price.  Mr Ong Kian  Min,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  who,  I am told, has a larger than average  family,\r\n\r\nwould have to be given a higher subsidy in order to afford  a\r\n\r\nHDB flat.  Is that not right?\r\n\r\n<br>4.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Let us take a three-child family.\r\n\r\nIn  addition  to the family income, let us take the  kind  of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  for  a  three-child family and  use  that  as  a\r\n\r\nbenchmark,  and  then purely using 40% of  household  income.\r\n\r\nBecause,  for  a young couple with no children  versus  three\r\n\r\nchildren, it is going to mean different things when  we  talk\r\n\r\nabout affordability.  And that is the problem we face in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency when we tell constituents that the Minister says\r\n\r\nit is affordable.  But the people with three kids say no.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> But that is precisely what I mean. The\r\n\r\nfamilies with five children would have to have a different\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprice.   A family with six would have to have another  price.\r\n\r\nThat is exactly what I am talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would advise Singaporeans to purchase their flats\r\n\r\nbased  on their needs and on their affordability.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is  any  problem with  affordability.   As  the\r\n\r\nstatistics  and  the experience of HDB show  today,  the  40%\r\n\r\nlimit  that  is  used to compute the maximum loan  is  not  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   As  I  have explained earlier, the average  family\r\n\r\ncomes  in  way below the 40%.  So there is really no  problem\r\n\r\nwith affordability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem arises when family expenditures become\r\n\r\nextremely  high, and not necessarily related to family  size.\r\n\r\nThere   are  many  families  whose  expenditures   have   got\r\n\r\nabsolutely no relationship to family size, and yet because of\r\n\r\ntheir lifestyle, household expenditures are high.  So, if  we\r\n\r\nwere  to accede to that request, then I think HDB would  have\r\n\r\nto  go and do a means test for every family, and look at  how\r\n\r\nmuch  money they spend on  children, on tuition, whether they\r\n\r\nhave a car, whether they go on holidays, etc, etc.  So let us\r\n\r\nnot  get  into  that.  It is very messy.  The present  system\r\n\r\ntoday works fine and let us leave it at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked a very specific question about the\r\n\r\npricing of flats in his constituency.  I do not have all  the\r\n\r\ndetails  at  hand,  but  suffice it to  say  that,  generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  when  flats are priced, they are priced  based  on\r\n\r\nseveral  factors, one of which, of course, is the  prevailing\r\n\r\nmarket  price, because that is where the affordability  issue\r\n\r\ncomes  in.  At any point in time, in order to make the  price\r\n\r\naffordable,  you  would  have to  benchmark  it  against  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  market price.  So, it may well be that the different\r\n\r\nbatches  of flats that were offered to his constituents  were\r\n\r\noffered  at  times when prices were fluctuating very  wildly.\r\n\r\nSo there must have been a very sharp difference in the resale\r\n\r\nprices   from  one  batch  to  another.   Hence,  the   sharp\r\n\r\ndifference in the prices offered by HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is how the pricing works. When resale prices\r\n\r\ncome down, HDB prices\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfollow.   And, similarly, when prices go up, HDB flat  prices\r\n\r\nalso  follow.  Those who have bought earlier at  high  prices\r\n\r\nobviously  feel aggrieved.  But I do not think we can  accede\r\n\r\nto  their  request to actually give them  a  refund.   If  we\r\n\r\nwanted  to do that, then I think we would either have to  fix\r\n\r\nall  prices the same irregardless of the time of year or when\r\n\r\nit  is sold, or we would also have to ask those who have paid\r\n\r\nlower prices to top up when the next batch comes in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is reasonable for the Member to make this\r\n\r\nrequest on behalf of his constituents, but I hope the  Member\r\n\r\nwould also agree with me that he is really trying his luck on\r\n\r\nthis one.  Sir, I hate to disappoint him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have also voiced concern about the role of\r\n\r\nHDB  or the apparent move of HDB into better quality housing.\r\n\r\nMr Lew Syn Pau and Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, among others, made these\r\n\r\ncomments,   expressing  reservations   about   HDB's   recent\r\n\r\nannouncement  of premium apartments.  First of  all,  let  me\r\n\r\nstate at the outset that I agree with Members that HDB should\r\n\r\nfocus on providing affordable public housing for the majority\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans.  This has and this will continue to be  the\r\n\r\nmission of HDB.   There has been no change in housing  policy\r\n\r\nor in the type of flats offered for sale by HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has all along provided two categories of flats for\r\n\r\nsale  to  public  housing applicants. One,  is  the  standard\r\n\r\nflats,  and these are flats which come with limited  finishes\r\n\r\nfor  applicants who prefer to put in their own finishes.  The\r\n\r\nother  type  of  flat  is the so-called  design-and-build  or\r\n\r\ndesign-plus  flat,  and  these flats  come  with  full  floor\r\n\r\nfinishes.   What HDB has done, in order to minimise confusion\r\n\r\nthat  flat applicants have over the different range of  flats\r\n\r\noffered  for sale, it has grouped the design-and-build  flats\r\n\r\nand  the design-plus flats into one category and called  them\r\n\r\npremium   apartments.   This  is  purely  an   administrative\r\n\r\nrenaming  exercise.  There is no change  in  the  flat  type,\r\n\r\nneither is there a change in the selling price.  And it does\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot in any way affect the affordability of HDB flats nor will\r\n\r\nthey  pose a competition nor indeed are they intended to pose\r\n\r\nany   competition  to  Executive  Condominiums   or   private\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim spoke about the problems faced by his\r\n\r\nresidents in Sengkang New Town.  I do sympathise with him  in\r\n\r\nthis regard and, in fact, this is the reason why we set up  a\r\n\r\nspecial  committee  chaired  by Dr  Michael  Lim  called  the\r\n\r\nSengkang  Town  Steering Committee in order to  get  all  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   agencies  together  to  better   coordinate   the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  services.  All I can  say  is  that  HDB  will\r\n\r\nprovide  every support and do its best to help  the  Sengkang\r\n\r\nTown  Steering  Committee to enhance coordination  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem every time HDB establishes a new town,\r\n\r\nand  that  is the reason why there is a difference  in  price\r\n\r\nbetween  mature  estates  and  non-mature  estates.    Mature\r\n\r\nestates are like Toa Payoh, Ang Mo Kio, Bedok and so on.  All\r\n\r\nthe facilities are there.  Transportation facilities are more\r\n\r\nthan   adequate.    Marketing  facilities,  shops,   schools,\r\n\r\nclinics,  etc, are all there.  They have all grown  with  the\r\n\r\ntown  over  the years.  Residents have moved in.   Businesses\r\n\r\nare doing well.  Residents are happy.  That is the reason why\r\n\r\nthey  call  it  a  mature estate.  On  the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nSengkang town, Punggol 21 and so on are towns where residents\r\n\r\nare only beginning to move in.  Facilities are also beginning\r\n\r\nto  move  in.   Shopkeepers are trying to find and  establish\r\n\r\ntheir  footing.  Not everybody wants to go and  build or  set\r\n\r\nup a clinic there because they do not see the business there,\r\n\r\nfor  example.   And that is the reason why there  is  such  a\r\n\r\nshortage of facilities.  But having said all that, I think we\r\n\r\nshould, as far as possible, get the various agencies together\r\n\r\nand  make  sure that such facilities are provided as  quickly\r\n\r\nand as conveniently as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to questions on HDB upgrading\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   The  Main Upgrading Programme and  the  Interim\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme are programmes that were started 10 years\r\n\r\nago.  The purpose was to make sure that older\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestates do not degenerate, to rejuvenate and bring them up to\r\n\r\nthe standard of the newer estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December last year, the Prime Minister asked my\r\n\r\nMinistry to review the MUP and IUP with a view to making them\r\n\r\nmore cost effective and relevant to residents' needs.  Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  pleased  to  inform the House that the  review  has  been\r\n\r\ncompleted.    In  this  review,  HDB  sought  feedback   from\r\n\r\nresidents and MPs, through surveys and dialogue sessions,  to\r\n\r\nfind  out what are the things that people want, what are  the\r\n\r\nthings  that  people value.  The HDB also spoke to  the  town\r\n\r\ncouncils to find out what sort of problems they face in terms\r\n\r\nof maintenance in upkeeping upgraded estates.  HDB internally\r\n\r\nalso  looked at its own work processes in order to streamline\r\n\r\nwork  flows,  in order to increase the cost effectiveness  of\r\n\r\nthe HDB upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, HDB survey results show that the residents are\r\n\r\ngenerally  most appreciative of improvement items  that  give\r\n\r\nthem  direct benefits.  I think this is not surprising.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  kind of items?  This is what the surveys sought to find\r\n\r\nout.   Based on this feedback, HDB has revised the  scope  of\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  works to concentrate more on  the  functional\r\n\r\nitems.  The focus will shift from precinct and block works to\r\n\r\nworks  within  the flat.  Less functional and cost  effective\r\n\r\nitems  like amphitheatres and extensive landscaping  will  be\r\n\r\nscaled  down, as they add to maintenance cost.  But  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  assure the House that HDB will continue to  provide\r\n\r\nprecinct and block works that yield tangible benefits to  the\r\n\r\nresidents, and I am talking about popular items like  covered\r\n\r\nlinkways, lift upgrading, etc.  And we will also ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  programme is obvious to  the  residents.   In\r\n\r\nother words, that MUP blocks will be distinctive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the full range of internal works that are\r\n\r\ncurrently  carried  out  within the  flats  today,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nreplace  the main entrance door and all windows in  the  flat\r\n\r\nduring  MUP.   This  is  in response to  many  requests  from\r\n\r\nMembers in the House on behalf of their residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kreta Ayer-Tanglin, Mr Lew Syn Pau,\r\n\r\ncommented just now in this regard that Government should  not\r\n\r\nbe  too  involved inside the flat.  This seems to fly in  the\r\n\r\nface  of his advice.  But let me say that I do agree that  we\r\n\r\nshould  just carry out only essential works within the  flat.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not  going  in to renovate the whole  flat  for  the\r\n\r\nlessee.  Items such as space adding items, the replacement of\r\n\r\nthe  discharge stack in the bathrooms, these are massive  and\r\n\r\ncostly exercises.  No resident can do it on his own.  It  has\r\n\r\nto  be done by HDB, and this is what the HDB will continue to\r\n\r\ndo.   But  other items that he can do himself, these we  will\r\n\r\nleave to the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more cost effective upgrading package, the budget\r\n\r\nfor MUP and IUP will be rationalised.  The revised budget per\r\n\r\nflat for MUP will be $37,600 and $58,300 for the standard and\r\n\r\nstandard-plus packages respectively, down from  the  original\r\n\r\n$42,400 and $67,200 for standard and standard-plus.  For IUP,\r\n\r\nthe  two-tier  budget will be brought down from the  existing\r\n\r\n$5,000 without full lift upgrading, and $8,000 with full lift\r\n\r\nupgrading   per   flat,  to  $4,000  and  $7,000   per   flat\r\n\r\nrespectively.   With  these  revisions,  residents  can  look\r\n\r\nforward  to  a  smaller  MUP  upgrading  bill,  better  value\r\n\r\nimprovement works that will benefit them more.  The IUP  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  fully  funded by the Government  and  later\r\n\r\ntoday,  HDB  will be issuing a press statement to  give  full\r\n\r\ndetails of the revised programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wan asked about the pace of the HDB upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.   He  asked Government to speed up  the  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.   Sir,  with the revised MUP and IUP  budgets  and\r\n\r\nwith the recovery of the economy, I am pleased to inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse that the Government will step up the upgrading schedule\r\n\r\nthis year.  We intend to announce 12 MUP precincts and 20 IUP\r\n\r\nprecincts for this year 2000, compared with 5 MUP and 18  IUP\r\n\r\nprecincts  last  year.  This means that the number  of  flats\r\n\r\nwhich  will enjoy the benefits of upgrading will go up,  from\r\n\r\nless  than  20,000  last year to something like  26,000  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the actual precincts to be selected, I think this\r\n\r\nis  always  a contentious point, and Mr Low Thia  Khiang  has\r\n\r\nmade  some comments on this.  Earlier, we also heard  Mr  Goh\r\n\r\nChee  Wee making exactly the same comment, that if we do  not\r\n\r\nspeed it up, his constituents will miss out.  I think we have\r\n\r\nin  this  House  and outside clarified many  times  that  the\r\n\r\nupgrading programme is a long term programme.  If you add  up\r\n\r\nthe  total number of flats, it is something close to  400,000\r\n\r\nflats  that  are  eligible for upgrading even under  existing\r\n\r\ncriteria.   Reasonably speaking, you can  do  something  like\r\n\r\n20,000,  maybe 26,000 this year if we speed it up.   At  that\r\n\r\nrate, we are looking at a 15-20 year programme.  There is  no\r\n\r\nway  that we can do all constituencies at one go, whether  it\r\n\r\nis  Boon  Lay or Hougang.  Some must go first, and some  must\r\n\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member for Boon Lay complains that some of the\r\n\r\nold  flats in his constituency have not yet been selected for\r\n\r\nMUP,  I  feel  very  sympathetic.  But he also  has  to  wait\r\n\r\nbecause we have got many criteria to consider.  If we were to\r\n\r\njust  go  on age alone (and I know Boon Lay has got many  old\r\n\r\nflats),  there are many old flats in Queenstown,  Toa  Payoh,\r\n\r\nAng  Mo  Kio, Redhill, Hougang (not that old, but  reasonably\r\n\r\nold), as the previous Minister has explained many times,  all\r\n\r\nthe  upgrading  is  going to be done in  Queenstown,  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  and Redhill, and none would be done in Marine  Parade,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister's constituency, Bedok and Ang Mo Kio.   So\r\n\r\nit  is  not just age alone.  Age is only one of the criteria.\r\n\r\nWe  have to ensure a good spread of the precincts across  the\r\n\r\nvarious housing estates.  That is another criterion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not all, because we also have several other\r\n\r\ncriteria,  including the level of support and the cleanliness\r\n\r\nof  the  estate  which is a proxy for the community   spirit.\r\n\r\nBecause  there are so many eligible precincts, and there  are\r\n\r\nsuch strong demands for upgrading because of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefits, it is difficult for the Ministry to just base it on\r\n\r\none  or  two criteria.  There are several criteria that  have\r\n\r\nbeen spelt out.  Some are subjective, some are objective like\r\n\r\nthe age, some we will have to make a judgment, like the level\r\n\r\nof support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have \"level of support\"? Mr Low Thia Khiang\r\n\r\nmentioned that the Government is not fair because it does not\r\n\r\nupgrade  flats in Hougang.  Let me put it this way.   If  you\r\n\r\nhave two MPs who are asking for upgrading, one MP goes around\r\n\r\nexplaining  to his constituents what is upgrading,  what  are\r\n\r\nthe  benefits of upgrading, how is it that the Government  is\r\n\r\nable  to spend $500 million or more a year on upgrading.   It\r\n\r\nis  because of the policies which generate surplus.   Without\r\n\r\nthe  policies that generate surplus, and without  a  surplus,\r\n\r\nwhat  is  the point of talking about upgrading?  One MP  goes\r\n\r\naround and explains to the people, yes, these policies  which\r\n\r\nwill  not be popular sometimes, these are policies which,  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  the  day,  help  the  Government  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ngenerating a surplus, these are policies which reflect a very\r\n\r\nprudent  financial  policy.  As a  result  of  these  prudent\r\n\r\nfinancial  policies,  you  have  a  surplus.   He  tells  his\r\n\r\nconstituents to vote for this party because this is the party\r\n\r\nthat is able to generate surpluses and this is the party that\r\n\r\ndistributes  the  surpluses in the form of  upgrading,  among\r\n\r\nother  things, and vote for him as an MP so that he can fight\r\n\r\nfor  upgrading, so that he can get upgrading earlier for  his\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you have another candidate who goes around telling\r\n\r\nhis  constituents that the Government's policies  are  wrong,\r\n\r\nthat  Government  makes  money from   the  people,  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  rich,  the people are poor.   The  Government\r\n\r\nshould  redistribute wealth through subsidies, that upgrading\r\n\r\nis  a  joke.   If you were the Minister in charge of deciding\r\n\r\nwhich constituency were to be upgraded first, which one would\r\n\r\nyou   choose?   The  one  who  supports  the  programme   and\r\n\r\nencourages his residents to support the programme, or the one\r\n\r\nwho does not make any effort to support the programme and, on\r\n\r\ntop of that, runs\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndown  the  Government's policies which created  the  surplus,\r\n\r\nwhich  allows  these  programmes to be implemented.   As  the\r\n\r\nAmericans  would call it, it is a \"no brainer\".  So  this  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that we have always had to explain very carefully.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a  question of fairness.  It is  a  question  of\r\n\r\nprioritisation.  It is a question of whether you support, not\r\n\r\njust  upgrading, but the whole range of policies which allows\r\n\r\nus to implement the upgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A last point for Mr Low Thia Khiang's information, his\r\n\r\nflats are not the oldest flats in Singapore.  There are  many\r\n\r\nother  constituencies which have got flats  even  older  than\r\n\r\nhis,  who  are also in the queue  and who are also trying  to\r\n\r\njump  the  queue.  Potong Pasir is one, Toa Payoh is another,\r\n\r\nRedhill, Tiong Bahru, Queenstown.  I have asked for the  list\r\n\r\nbecause  I  wanted to be absolutely sure that HDB is  totally\r\n\r\nfair and objective about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few questions on lift upgrading. Mr\r\n\r\nSeng  Han  Thong  has  asked  several  questions  about  lift\r\n\r\nupgrading,  so has Mr Ang Mong Seng. There is no  doubt  that\r\n\r\nlift upgrading is one of the most popular items under MUP and\r\n\r\nIUP.  And with an ageing population, as Mr Ang Mong Seng very\r\n\r\ngraphically put it just now, lift upgrading is something that\r\n\r\nwe  should  seriously consider in order to meet the  mobility\r\n\r\nneeds of residents.  But let me try and convince Members that\r\n\r\nlift upgrading is a very expensive proposition.  It does  not\r\n\r\ncome  cheap.   This  is the reason why in order  to  try  and\r\n\r\nprioritise  the  flats which qualify for lift upgrading,  HDB\r\n\r\nhas  in  place a set of criteria, like how many people  would\r\n\r\nbenefit if we put in the lift, benefit per flat, and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng requested that Government extends lift\r\n\r\nupgrading  to all blocks under HDB.  Let me inform the  House\r\n\r\nthat HDB already allows full lift upgrading under IUP if  the\r\n\r\nprecincts  meet  the lift upgrading criteria  and  if  it  is\r\n\r\nwithin  the IUP budget.  In fact, we have provided additional\r\n\r\nfunds for IUP, if the Member would like to upgrade his lifts.\r\n\r\nThe lift upgrading programme is a very massive programme.  It\r\n\r\ninvolves major structural\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworks  because  you  have to put in  new  lift  shafts,  link\r\n\r\nbridges  and  so  on.  Generally speaking, I would  recommend\r\n\r\nthat  we  do lift upgrading only under MUP rather  than  IUP.\r\n\r\nBut those who want to do it under IUP, there is provision  to\r\n\r\ndo  so,  but  bear in mind that you would have  to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nsomething else, and you must also meet the criteria.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong mentioned, the blocks that do not\r\n\r\nmeet  the lift criteria are generally the so-called segmented\r\n\r\nblocks.  I think he knows the blocks in question.  Basically,\r\n\r\nthese  are blocks which really require additional lift shafts\r\n\r\nand new lifts to be added.  Where it is technically feasible,\r\n\r\nHDB  is  prepared to be flexible and allows  such  blocks  to\r\n\r\nundergo  full  lift upgrading under MUP.   But  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ninstallation  will  mean a significantly increased  upgrading\r\n\r\nbill for the residents.  Notwithstanding that it is co-shared\r\n\r\nbetween  Government and the residents, with  this  particular\r\n\r\nfeature,  it is going to be much higher.  We  would  have  to\r\n\r\nrequire from the residents a very firm indication.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  we  will have to go through a voting process  to  get\r\n\r\nfrom the residents an indication whether they want to proceed\r\n\r\nwith  this  upgrading or not.  HDB is now  looking  into  the\r\n\r\ndetails,  including  the  co-sharing  formula,  criteria  for\r\n\r\nupgrading and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few other miscellaneous issues which I may quickly\r\n\r\nround  off.  Executive Condominium housing,  Mr Lew  and  Mrs\r\n\r\nLim  asked about the relevance of the EC scheme.  All  of  us\r\n\r\nwould agree that EC housing has achieved its social objective\r\n\r\nwhich  was,  at that time, to provide a category  of  private\r\n\r\nhousing  that  meets  the  need of the  so-called  sandwiched\r\n\r\nclass,  the young professional couples.  If you look  at  the\r\n\r\nstatistics  of the people who buy the EC, the majority,  more\r\n\r\nthan  three-quarters of them, are actually first-timers,  and\r\n\r\nmost  of these people are young couples, between the ages  of\r\n\r\n25  and  35.   The EC scheme has worked and it  has  met  the\r\n\r\nobjective.   It has provided an alternative housing  type  to\r\n\r\nthese young families.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin asked about the mutual exchange of flats\r\n\r\nscheme.   There is such a scheme but I am afraid that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  exactly  very popular because of the constraints.   Only\r\n\r\nabout 20 flats are exchanged every year.  Having said that, I\r\n\r\nmust  also  point  out that there are many other  schemes  in\r\n\r\nplace  that  facilitate extended families living together  or\r\n\r\nliving  close  to  one another. There is the Joint  Selection\r\n\r\nScheme,  the Multi-tier Family Scheme, the Conversion Scheme,\r\n\r\nand  of  course,  let  us not forget the  CPF  Housing  Grant\r\n\r\nScheme,  which  is  the grant of $40,000 to encourage  first-timers to buy resale flats near their families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Dr Jennifer Lee asked about whether we should\r\n\r\nrequire industrial and commercial developers to provide child\r\n\r\ncare  facilities or elderly care facilities.   First of  all,\r\n\r\nlet me just point out that the development control guidelines\r\n\r\ndo not restrict the provision of such facilities.  Yes, there\r\n\r\nis a cap on it, but they are able to provide such facilities.\r\n\r\nBut whether we should require them to provide the facilities,\r\n\r\nthat is another matter altogether.  I am reluctant to move to\r\n\r\nthat  stage  of being so prescriptive, but if the Member  has\r\n\r\ngot  a very strong case, I am prepared to listen in terms  of\r\n\r\nhow to convince the developers to provide such facilities.  I\r\n\r\nwould have thought that if it does help the developer to make\r\n\r\nthat  development  more attractive, they would  provide  such\r\n\r\nfacilities on their own volition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On flexibility in doing business, Mr Peh Chin Hua\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we  should allow HDB flats  to  be  used  as\r\n\r\noffices.   I  do  not  know whether  he  is  aware  that  the\r\n\r\nTechnopreneur  Home  Office Scheme has  already  kicked  off.\r\n\r\nThis  actually allows people to use their HDB flats as office\r\n\r\naddresses  subject, of course, to certain conditions.   I  am\r\n\r\nvery  happy  to  tell him that HDB has to date  approved  150\r\n\r\napplications from applicants to use their flats as registered\r\n\r\noffices.  I do not see any problem at all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about the 30% retention policy. He is\r\n\r\ncorrect in saying\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat   this  was  introduced  in  1979  to  encourage  better\r\n\r\nmaintenance  and he feels that this ruling may no  longer  be\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I agree with him and I want to tell him that  URA\r\n\r\nis  currently reviewing this retention policy, together  with\r\n\r\nthe BCA, with a view to removing it.\r\n\r\n<br>5.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I see time is running short, I would just like\r\n\r\nto  respond very quickly to Members' comments on Construction\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen and Dr Teo Ho Pin commented on the\r\n\r\nConstruction  21  report.  Mr Kenneth  Chen,  in  particular,\r\n\r\nexpressed,  I  thought, some reservations about  whether  the\r\n\r\nreport can achieve its objectives.  Let me just tell him that\r\n\r\nthese  are targets.  The report was not prepared just by  the\r\n\r\nofficials alone.  They were prepared in conjunction with  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals   in   the  industry.   There   was   extensive\r\n\r\nconsultation  among  different  Ministries  -   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nManpower,  my  Ministry, BCA, Professional  Engineers  Board,\r\n\r\nBoard of Architects, SCAL, REDAS, and so on and so forth.  So\r\n\r\nI  think  all the possible stakeholders have been  consulted.\r\n\r\nThey have been involved in the deliberations.  The C21 report\r\n\r\ntook  a  while to cook and to finalise.  I think the  process\r\n\r\nitself makes me optimistic, and so is the industry optimistic\r\n\r\nthat the targets are achievable.  So I would say, let us give\r\n\r\nit a try, and let us work hard to make it work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In so far as whether we should register contractors - I\r\n\r\nthink this was the other point he raised, that is, whether we\r\n\r\nshould   license  the  contractors,  this  is  one   of   the\r\n\r\nrecommendations in the report by the architects,  I  believe,\r\n\r\nand  the developers.  Obviously the contractors were not  too\r\n\r\nkeen on this one.  But I think BCA is currently studying  the\r\n\r\nfeasibility and the effectiveness of this recommendation.  So\r\n\r\nwe would await their comments on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, I have covered most if not all of the\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, may I have a point of\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Thank you, Sir. The Minister said\r\n\r\nthat  if  you consider family size, then how are we going  to\r\n\r\ndetermine for one-child, two-child, three-child families.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  have already in the pricing, looked  at  location,\r\n\r\nfloor level, and at the type and size of a flat.  So I do not\r\n\r\nsee why in terms of subsidy, we cannot have different scales,\r\n\r\nie, 1, 2, 3.  Suppose if this is not possible, then the other\r\n\r\nsimpler approach is to look at the 40% magic formula and  try\r\n\r\nand  reduce  it to, say, 30% in light of some  of  these.   I\r\n\r\nthink  that will be a more simpler formula to look at.   That\r\n\r\nis point one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point two is on land sales which I talked about. I did\r\n\r\nnot quite get an answer, maybe because my points did not come\r\n\r\nout  across  clearly.   My  point is  that  we  need  a  more\r\n\r\ntransparent  and a more medium term planning so  that  prices\r\n\r\nwill  not  have  to fluctuate or go through a  roller-coaster\r\n\r\nride within a year.  It picks up before the announcement  and\r\n\r\nthen  comes  down after the announcement, or vice  versa.   I\r\n\r\nthink we need a more long-term and a more gradual increase in\r\n\r\nprices,  and not 33% in one year and so on.  So we need  that\r\n\r\npolicy to be looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point, Sir, is HDB 2. I think some years ago\r\n\r\nwe  said  that MRT would be the monopoly, but today  we  have\r\n\r\ncompetitors.  I hope at some point of time we will  have  HDB\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister says that he has\r\n\r\na comprehensive list of old flats, waiting to be upgraded, to\r\n\r\nprove  that Hougang flats are not the oldest.  Would he  make\r\n\r\navailable  the  whole list to me or to make it  public?   And\r\n\r\nwould he estimate what is the time frame that my estate would\r\n\r\nbe upgraded?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second clarification, Sir. The Minister mentioned about\r\n\r\nthe criteria for the upgrading.  I want to ask him this.   By\r\n\r\ntying  the  upgrading programme to political  support  level,\r\n\r\ndoes  it  make any difference at all to pork barrel  politics\r\n\r\nwhere  you use Government funds to dispense benefits to  your\r\n\r\nsupporters?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> First of all, let me answer Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan.   He was first in the queue; higher  priority.\r\n\r\nI have to give face to my parliamentary colleague.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan is quite adamant that the family size\r\n\r\nshould be a factor in the setting of prices.  My point really\r\n\r\nis  that  it is not HDB's ambit.  It is not HDB's mission  to\r\n\r\nactually  vary  prices  according to family  size.   We  vary\r\n\r\nprices  according  to location.  I think  that  is  eminently\r\n\r\nsuitable.  We vary prices according to floor, which floor  it\r\n\r\nis  (low  floor or high floor).  I think that is also  easily\r\n\r\nunderstood,  and no arguments.  Either you are  on  the  25th\r\n\r\nfloor  or you are on the 2nd floor.  We vary prices according\r\n\r\nto  closeness  to MRT.  Again, no questions asked.   But  the\r\n\r\nmoment  you ask HDB to start to vary prices according to  how\r\n\r\nmany  children  you  have, HDB is going  to  have  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nproblems,  and I do not think this is something  we  want  to\r\n\r\ncommit  HDB  to doing.  So let us agree to disagree  on  this\r\n\r\none.  I do not think it is a good idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about release of land. The question of\r\n\r\nrelease  of land is really a question of what do we  want  to\r\n\r\nachieve.   His point is that we should be achieving stability\r\n\r\nin price.  I think that is a very tall order for any Ministry\r\n\r\nor  any  authority or any government to achieve.  To  achieve\r\n\r\nstability in price, I think, requires you to monitor  and  to\r\n\r\nfind  out or to second guess what the market is going  to  be\r\n\r\nlike.   If you want to achieve that, you have got to  release\r\n\r\nland  in  a  way that will help to soak up the demand.   Even\r\n\r\nthen, you may not be able to succeed.  So what do we do?   We\r\n\r\nsay, let us gauge what is the medium term demand.  These  are\r\n\r\nthe  numbers  of  new households that are being  formed,  the\r\n\r\nnumber of young families that are coming into the market, the\r\n\r\npeople  who  are coming in from overseas, whether  employment\r\n\r\npass  holders, professionals or PRs, or whatever - let us  do\r\n\r\nan  estimate on what is the medium term demand, what  is  the\r\n\r\ntrend.   In  the  Concept Plan review, you are talking  about\r\n\r\npopulation  target of 5.5 million, what does that  entail  in\r\n\r\nterms of number of units that are required.  And then we work\r\n\r\ntowards  that.  We release land such that the private  sector\r\n\r\nand also the public sector, HDB,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  provide the required number of units.  And I think  that\r\n\r\nis what we will do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term fluctuations from year to year depending on\r\n\r\nthe  stock market, depending on the external demand  -  these\r\n\r\nare all short-term fluctuations which I think we are not in a\r\n\r\nposition to try and anticipate or second guess.  So,  as  far\r\n\r\nas  possible, the policy is, let us release a steady flow  of\r\n\r\nland  for a long term or medium term supply, and prices  will\r\n\r\nfluctuate according to how the demand comes in.  But in  that\r\n\r\nway, by making that clear and making that transparent, people\r\n\r\nare  not  tempted to go and rush in if they do not  need  to.\r\n\r\nPeople  are  not  tempted to try and chase prices  like  what\r\n\r\nhappened  during  the peak of the property boom.   They  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  supply  is  available;  it  is  coming  on-stream;\r\n\r\nGovernment  land sales programme is this amount  every  year.\r\n\r\nIf  you  are  interested  in public  housing,  we  also  have\r\n\r\nsufficient  public housing available for you.  You  join  the\r\n\r\nqueue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that is a very clear cut, a very transparent and\r\n\r\na  very  fair policy which will help to ensure that there  is\r\n\r\nstability in the supply and it will help to ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nmarket in the long term is fairly well balanced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made one last point about HDB 2. I think I have\r\n\r\ngiven him an answer on that one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on Mr Low Thia Khiang's point - list of old flats\r\n\r\nwaiting to be upgraded.  He would like to have a list.  We do\r\n\r\nnot  give this list to anybody, even the PAP Members who ask.\r\n\r\nI do not think we should give this list freely.  But you know\r\n\r\nwhat  the flats are, you know the age of your flats  in  your\r\n\r\nconstituency.   And  I think, generally, people  do  know  in\r\n\r\nthose  areas that I mentioned just now - Redhill, Toa  Payoh,\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  Tiong  Bahru.  I think if you  go  and  do  some\r\n\r\nhomework, you will be able to find out where these flats are.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the time frame, as I indicated earlier, this is a\r\n\r\nvery  long-term programme.  We are about half way through  or\r\n\r\nmaybe slightly more.  But I think it is very presumptuous  to\r\n\r\nsay  that  this is going to be the five-year time  frame  for\r\n\r\nMUP.   For a start, how do we know that we are going to  have\r\n\r\nsurpluses  every  year  for  the next  five  years?  This  is\r\n\r\nsomething that we should not forget - that we can only do  an\r\n\r\nupgrading  if  we  have the surpluses.  Therefore,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nprovide any time frame for MUP programme.

Mrs Lim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, frequently after an Interim or\r\n\r\nMain Upgrading Programme, estates are renamed by residents to\r\n\r\ngive  better sounding names or ones that reflect the  history\r\n\r\nor  location.  For example, Serangoon North Avenue 1  becomes\r\n\r\nHwi Yoh Court.  If I recall correctly, Serangoon North was so\r\n\r\nnamed  as  it  was an estate lying to the north of  Serangoon\r\n\r\nCentral.  Never mind the fact that many people still refer to\r\n\r\nthe place as the Jalan Hwi Yoh area.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, we used to name a whole estate to reflect the\r\n\r\nhistory  or location.  For example, we adopted the series  of\r\n\r\nMarine Terrace, Marine Drive, Marine Parade Central, etc, for\r\n\r\nthe  reclaimed  land  in the East Coast back  in  the  1970s.\r\n\r\nSomehow  along  the way, it appears we got less  imaginative.\r\n\r\nWe  started naming streets, roads and avenues by numbers  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  letters.  So we have typically an A, B,  C  avenue\r\n\r\nseries,  following  by  an A, B, C street  series.   We  even\r\n\r\nclassify  them  as Neighbourhoods 1, N1, N2, and  so  on,  as\r\n\r\ndepicted  by  a  web on a large signboard, as one  approaches\r\n\r\nnewer  estates, if one drives slow enough to take in all  the\r\n\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely we are not so devoid of imagination nor history\r\n\r\nas to fall back on a somewhat scientific method of naming our\r\n\r\nestates which get promptly renamed after upgrading.   We  are\r\n\r\nnot  like  typical US streets which run on a grid system  and\r\n\r\nfor  which  both  private  and public  housing  estates  have\r\n\r\nevolved  over  time.   I  would therefore  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister to consider naming new estates which are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore  reflective  of  the  history  or  significance  of  the\r\n\r\nlocality right from conception.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the two\r\n\r\nmain  problems  faced by HDB dwellers are  spalling  concrete\r\n\r\nfrom  the ceiling and the leaking floor from the toilets  and\r\n\r\nkitchen.  The issue of spalling concrete has been extensively\r\n\r\ndiscussed  in  the newspapers and I shall not dwell  upon  it\r\n\r\nhere.   The  leaking  from  the  floor  concerns  the  family\r\n\r\nupstairs  and  the family downstairs.  If it is not  properly\r\n\r\ndealt with, it will certainly affect the relationship between\r\n\r\nthe two families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's common practice is to ask the two families, the\r\n\r\none  upstairs  and  the one downstairs,  to  co-pay  for  the\r\n\r\nrepair.   The  family downstairs felt that it is very  unfair\r\n\r\nbecause they have to endure the inconvenience of having water\r\n\r\nleaking  through  their ceiling and falling on  their  heads.\r\n\r\nYet,  they  are asked to pay part of the repair cost  despite\r\n\r\nthe  fact that this is in no way due to any fault of  theirs.\r\n\r\nIf  the people upstairs have changed the floor tiles and,  in\r\n\r\nthe  process, damaged the water-proof layer, then  of  course\r\n\r\nthey  are  liable to pay for it.  But if they have  not  done\r\n\r\nanything  to  the  flooring, yet water is  leaking  from  the\r\n\r\nfloor, then who is responsible?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's explanation is that the floor is a party-structure\r\n\r\nbelonging   to  both  the  people  upstairs  and  the  people\r\n\r\ndownstairs  and,  of  course, they have  to  co-pay  for  the\r\n\r\nrepair.  But this explanation is just overly simplistic.  The\r\n\r\nquestion  is  whether this water-proof layer belongs  to  the\r\n\r\npeople upstairs, or the people upstairs and downstairs  share\r\n\r\nthe water-proof layer.  Of course, the people living upstairs\r\n\r\nhave  to  wash the floor in the bathroom and water will  leak\r\n\r\ndownstairs  if  the  floor is not waterproof.   In  order  to\r\n\r\nprevent leaking, normally waterproof chemicals are used.   So\r\n\r\napparently,  this  water-proof layer  should  belong  to  the\r\n\r\npeople  upstairs. If there is a problem the  people  upstairs\r\n\r\nshould  pay for the repair.  Now, with this leak, the  people\r\n\r\ndownstairs are already inconvenienced and yet you  want  them\r\n\r\nto pay for the repair.  It does seem to be very unfair.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote you an analogy - the forest fire in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   This  issue  which we  discussed  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nearlier  today and the haze resulting from this  forest  fire\r\n\r\nhas  caused some problems to us.  Just imagine, if  Indonesia\r\n\r\nsays  that since we share this air space and in order to  get\r\n\r\nrid  of  this haze, you will have to share the cost with  us.\r\n\r\nThis   explanation   is   apparently  farfetched   and   very\r\n\r\nunconvincing.   Of  course, if the family upstairs  has  just\r\n\r\nmoved  in  not too long ago and there is a leakage  from  the\r\n\r\nceiling,  then  the  problem must lie with the  construction.\r\n\r\nThe contractor should be responsible and residents should not\r\n\r\nbe  asked to pay for it.  Of course, the leak from the  floor\r\n\r\nis  not  a very major problem.  But with these flats  getting\r\n\r\nolder,  the problem would get more and more common.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  HDB can give them a very clear explanation  as  to\r\n\r\nwhich  part  of the repair should be borne by the  residents,\r\n\r\notherwise,  there  will  be  a  lot  of  quarrels  among  the\r\n\r\nresidents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, ongoing is a\r\n\r\nspate  of en bloc sales which will bring with it a whole  new\r\n\r\nset  of potential problems.  Kim Seng, being Districts 9  and\r\n\r\n10,  has  its fair share of en bloc sales and some  residents\r\n\r\nthere have voiced their concerns and their \"headaches\" on the\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most frequent complaint is about the noise and dust\r\n\r\nfrom  the redevelopment projects.  Other inconveniences, such\r\n\r\nas obstructions, traffic snarls and increased numbers of non-residents  all  add  up to the stressful environment.   Worse\r\n\r\nstill, are situations where several projects are going on  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  area  simultaneously.  Since these areas  are  all\r\n\r\ndensely  populated,  the number of people  inconvenienced  is\r\n\r\nconsiderable.   The  ill effects on these people  can  become\r\n\r\nintolerable.   Sir,  what  can  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment do to lessen the pain of these residents in their\r\n\r\npredicament?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is usually an increased plot ratio granted in most\r\n\r\nof these en bloc sales.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMany  new redevelopments can therefore have buildings as high\r\n\r\nas  30  storeys or more.  I know the Government  is  allowing\r\n\r\nthis plot ratio change to optimise the land use in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister  for National Development has, earlier  in  his\r\n\r\nreply,  touched  on this subject with some assurance  on  the\r\n\r\nplot  ratio  change.  My concern however is whether  we  have\r\n\r\nindeed  allowed this increased plot ratio even  though  there\r\n\r\nare  physical constraints.  For example, is it right to grant\r\n\r\na  plot  ratio  change when the site area is  small  and  the\r\n\r\naccess roads are tight and heavy with traffic?  Will we  have\r\n\r\na  situation where residents have to queue just to get out of\r\n\r\ntheir own gates?  Sir, there is even an instance of three  en\r\n\r\nbloc  redevelopments  with buildings to  go  as  high  as  30\r\n\r\nstoreys approved on sites with buildings of 10 storeys  on  a\r\n\r\nshort narrow road with definite constraints to road widening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Planning Act, it is a requirement for the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Guide  Plan  to be exhibited  so  as  to  obtain\r\n\r\nfeedback from the residents and the general public.  Sir,  as\r\n\r\nthe  notice is usually placed in an advertisement, it is  not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  because many people may not have read  or  paid\r\n\r\nattention  to such notices.  We may perhaps improve  in  this\r\n\r\narea  by  sending letters to the residents and allow them  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to raise objections, when necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment to look into the abovementioned issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, Singapore is a\r\n\r\nsmall nation.  We are only a little red dot on the map.  Just\r\n\r\nnow,  the  Minister  has  said that  our  population  is  3.5\r\n\r\nmillion.  Yesterday, Senior Parliamentary Secretary  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee  Shoon encouraged our people to give birth  to  more\r\n\r\nchildren so that our population may go up.  Bearing  in  mind\r\n\r\nwe  have very limited land for building houses and flats  for\r\n\r\nour  people to live in, we must have some long term plans  on\r\n\r\nour   land  use.   Consequent  to  this  consideration,   HDB\r\n\r\nintroduced  the  Selective   En  Bloc  Redevelopment   Scheme\r\n\r\n(SERS).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme will benefit our HDB\r\n\r\nresidents.   They will have their new flats to replace  their\r\n\r\nold  ones.   Most of these flats selected for SERS  are  more\r\n\r\nthan 25 years old.  But when the residents  move to their new\r\n\r\nflats, they are given new 99-year leases.  The new flats will\r\n\r\nnot   have  such  problems  as  leaking  floors  or  spalling\r\n\r\nconcrete, as described by Dr Ker just now.   On top of  that,\r\n\r\nthe  residents will enjoy modern and better facilities,  such\r\n\r\nas  lifts stopping at every floor for the residents.  It will\r\n\r\nalso  enhance the cohesiveness among the residents.  So  SERS\r\n\r\nis a win-win situation for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, I have a few suggestions to make. When HDB\r\n\r\nannounced  the  plans for the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment\r\n\r\nScheme,  they should give ample time and information  to  the\r\n\r\nresidents so that they can have a better understanding of the\r\n\r\ndetails of the whole programme, such as terms of compensation\r\n\r\nand   the  selling  price  of  their  new  flats,  etc.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should also help the lower income  families  with\r\n\r\nmore favourable packages. The residents  should be shown  the\r\n\r\nlayout  plans,  and even models,  of the new flats.   Because\r\n\r\nthe  new development is to give the residents the opportunity\r\n\r\nto upgrade themselves to modern and better-designed flats, so\r\n\r\nlong  as  the  residents  are well-informed  of  the  various\r\n\r\ndetails  of  the  exercise, they are  bound  to  support  it.\r\n\r\nHillview Estate is a very good example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB announced the plans, the residents were given\r\n\r\nonly  10 days to reply whether or not they would support  the\r\n\r\nproject.   Before they were informed of the  details  of  the\r\n\r\nplans,  they  were very unhappy.  The support rate  was  only\r\n\r\n86%.   However, after the dialogue session conducted  by  the\r\n\r\ngrassroots   organisations  and   the   exhibition   of   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment plan, the residents saw for themselves  what  was\r\n\r\nin  store for them, they were very happy.  Accordingly,   the\r\n\r\nsupport  rate  was raised from 86% to 95%.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\ntake  this  opportunity  to thank  Minister  Lim  Hng  Kiang,\r\n\r\nMinister  Mah Bow Tan and Senior Parliamentary Secretary  Koo\r\n\r\nTsai Kee and all the staff\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  HDB for the support and cooperation they have given to us\r\n\r\nin  explaining  these plans to the residents, so  that  these\r\n\r\nplans could be successfully implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since one of the objectives of this SERS programme is to\r\n\r\nmaintain the social bond among the residents in the  area,  I\r\n\r\nwould like to ask the Minister whether priority will be given\r\n\r\nto  the children of the existing residents to purchase  flats\r\n\r\nin  the  new  development so that they can  live  near  their\r\n\r\nparents.   This is also in line with our Government's  policy\r\n\r\nto encourage children to look after their parents.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.23 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nadd  my  weight  to Mr Ang Mong Seng's speech supporting  the\r\n\r\nSERS   programme.    Judging  from  the   asset   enhancement\r\n\r\nperspective,  I believe SERS is a better upgrading  programme\r\n\r\nfor  both the HDB and residents.  For those sites located  in\r\n\r\nthe  urban  areas, they unlock the land value through  better\r\n\r\nplot  ratio.   For those in the outlying areas, such  as  the\r\n\r\nHillview Avenue project, mentioned by my friend, Mr Ang  Mong\r\n\r\nSeng,  it  affords  a complete re-design  of  the  precincts.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  for estates built more than 20 years  ago,  the\r\n\r\npopulation  is  rapidly ageing as younger and outward  mobile\r\n\r\nfamilies upgrade to newer estates.  As a result, in  many  of\r\n\r\nthese  estates,  surface car parks are  by  and  large  empty\r\n\r\nbecause  the household profiles are very different  from  the\r\n\r\ntime when those flats were built.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bukit Timah GRC, the precinct in Clementi Town\r\n\r\nexemplifies  this  trend.   Sir,  by  bringing  back  younger\r\n\r\nresidents  it  will inject the redeveloped area with  renewed\r\n\r\nvitalities.  Consequently, if we also provide the children of\r\n\r\nthose already living in the district a higher priority,  like\r\n\r\nMr  Ang has pointed out, we could make use of the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  keep  multi-generation families closer  together  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   This  goes a long way towards  promoting  multi-generation family concept in Singapore.  Now that the  budget\r\n\r\nis healthy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonce again, the Minister is likely to get the necessary funds\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Minister to consider exploring\r\n\r\nwider implementation of SERS to bring about faster renewal of\r\n\r\nolder estates in Singapore.  If he is looking for a candidate\r\n\r\nsite,  there are actually two in Clementi that will be  quite\r\n\r\nsuitable,   failing which, of course, maybe he would  include\r\n\r\nthat two precincts into the MUP programme he has announced in\r\n\r\nParliament just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I too find that the priority allocations of various\r\n\r\nupgrading  projects  hard  to decipher.   Like  Mr  Low  Thia\r\n\r\nKhiang,  the residents in the two precincts which I mentioned\r\n\r\nhave also waited all these years without seeing any upgrading\r\n\r\nopportunity.    But  unlike  Mr  Low's  constituents,   these\r\n\r\nresidents living in the Bukit Timah precinct which was  still\r\n\r\na  single  Member  constituency in the general  election  had\r\n\r\nvoted  overwhelmingly for the PAP with a majority  vote  that\r\n\r\nwas within the top 10 in the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it is not too smart for Mr Low to belabour\r\n\r\nthis  point in Parliament. Maybe I should mention Mr Ang Mong\r\n\r\nSeng  as  an example. Many older PAP MPs envy Mr Ang  in  his\r\n\r\nability  to  bring  about  many  upgrading  projects  to  his\r\n\r\nconstituency.   As  I  look  at  Mr  Ang's  circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nidentified two relevant parameters. Firstly, Mr Ang Mong Seng\r\n\r\nis  a  first  term  Member of Parliament.  Secondly,  he  was\r\n\r\nreturned  from  a ward that was formerly an Opposition  ward.\r\n\r\nJudging  from the priority Mr Ang has managed to  obtain  for\r\n\r\nhis  residents  and given this fact, there is  a  possibility\r\n\r\nthat Mr Low Thia Khiang's constituents might wake up one  day\r\n\r\nto the fact that the best thing they can do for themselves is\r\n\r\nto vote for a PAP candidate in the next general elections.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun):</b> Sir, I would first like to take the cut by\r\n\r\nMrs  Lim  Hwee Hua.  Mrs Lim has proposed that we  should  be\r\n\r\nmore imaginative in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnaming HDB estates, streets, precincts, neighbourhoods and so\r\n\r\non.   In  the earlier HDB towns, the road names were  derived\r\n\r\nfrom  a  combination of town names and numbers based more  or\r\n\r\nless  on  a  grid  system.   This  was  very  systematic  and\r\n\r\nsequential  in  nature to facilitate an easy orientation  and\r\n\r\nidentification of roads. Based on feedback received, HDB  has\r\n\r\nintroduced  an  alternative approach to road  naming  and  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  identity of these towns and better reflect  the\r\n\r\nhistorical   significance.  For  example,  Sengkang   has   a\r\n\r\nhistorical  past  as a fishing village. Hence,  it  has  road\r\n\r\nnames  such  as Compassvale Street and Rivervale  Drive.  The\r\n\r\nsame  goes for Punggol 21, where road names like Punggol Dale\r\n\r\nand  Punggol  Field  are based on the original  topographical\r\n\r\nfeatures   of   vast  tracts  of  farmland  and   vegetation.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  different neigbourhoods in new  HDB  estates,  for\r\n\r\nexample Sengkang, will also be given names such as Rivervale,\r\n\r\nCompassvale,  Anchorvale and Fernvale. HDB will  continue  to\r\n\r\nname  roads  and  neighbourhoods  in  new  towns  using  this\r\n\r\nalternative approach. I am pleased to inform Mrs Lim that  we\r\n\r\nhave made progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker asked who should pay for the repair of ceiling\r\n\r\nleaks. To answer that question, it is very important to first\r\n\r\nestablish the principle.  The present rule uses the principle\r\n\r\nof  establishing  the  ownership of the  party  structure  to\r\n\r\ndetermine who should pay.  According to the Land Titles  Act,\r\n\r\nthe  party structure is owned jointly by the parties  sharing\r\n\r\nthe  use of it. So whether it is in public housing or private\r\n\r\nhousing, the practice is to require the households owning the\r\n\r\nsame structure to pay for the repair.  It is fair because  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  ask  the upper floor to pay,  the  upper  floor\r\n\r\nhousehold  would ask the same question, \"Why should  I  pay?\"\r\n\r\nWe  will  have problems in convincing them that  they  should\r\n\r\npay.   That is why we have all these disputes. But if we were\r\n\r\nto  tell  them  that it is a party structure and  since  both\r\n\r\nparties jointly own the structure and through wear and  tear,\r\n\r\nthere  are leaks, then there should be no argument that  both\r\n\r\nparties  should share the cost of repairing the  leaks.  This\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  practised, both in the public and private housing.   It\r\n\r\nis  fair if we continue with the practice, rather than,  say,\r\n\r\nimposing on the upper floor to pay.  He would say, \"I am just\r\n\r\nusing it normally and why should I pay for something which is\r\n\r\nowned  by  both parties?\".  In addition, we have to  bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  the  lower floor unit will also  have  his  party\r\n\r\nstructure  below.  The law is thus very fair  and  we  should\r\n\r\nkeep it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to Dr Lily Neo's point about the noise and\r\n\r\ndust  created from redevelopment projects. Dr Neo asked  what\r\n\r\ncould  be  done to lessen the pain of residents  affected  by\r\n\r\nnoise, dust and traffic congestion of redevelopment projects.\r\n\r\nWhen   developers  and  contractors  carry  out   development\r\n\r\nprojects,  they  have to comply with the  legal  requirements\r\n\r\nunder  the  Environmental (Pollution  Control)  Act  and  the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental  (Pollution Control of  Noise  at  Construction\r\n\r\nSites) Regulations. These regulations have been drawn  up  to\r\n\r\nprotect  the  residents  from being affected  by  intolerable\r\n\r\nlevels of environmental pollution. Members of the public  can\r\n\r\nalert  the  relevant  authorities  if  they  feel  that   the\r\n\r\ndevelopers have created an excessive level of noise, dust and\r\n\r\nconstruction  traffic.  The relevant authorities  would  take\r\n\r\nactions  against  the developers concerned if  investigations\r\n\r\nshow that the regulations have been violated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that Dr Neo raised is whether we\r\n\r\nhave  allowed development intensification, even though  there\r\n\r\nare   physical  constraints.   In  the  preparation  of   the\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Guide  Plans  (DGPs),  the  Urban  Redevelopment\r\n\r\nAuthority  (URA) will study with various authorities  on  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  increase the provision of infrastructure, utilities\r\n\r\nand  services  for  the  planning  areas  to  support  future\r\n\r\ndevelopments. For example, the Land Transport Authority would\r\n\r\nstudy  a need to widen existing roads or to build new  roads.\r\n\r\nAt  the  detailed  planning stage,  LTA  will  determine  the\r\n\r\nappropriate vehicular entries and exits of the development to\r\n\r\nminimise the conflicts in traffic flow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Dr Neo asked whether letters could be sent to\r\n\r\nresidents to inform them\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the DGP exhibitions. The DGPs were extensively publicised\r\n\r\nat  the  exhibition  stage. Besides  using  advertisement  to\r\n\r\nnotify   the  public,  press  releases  were  issued.   These\r\n\r\nexhibitions were held in convenient venues, such as community\r\n\r\ncentres, community clubs and shopping centres, etc, and  were\r\n\r\nwell  covered  by the print and the broadcast media.  Sending\r\n\r\nletters  to  every resident is time-consuming and costly  and\r\n\r\nsince  there are already many avenues to publicise the  DGPs,\r\n\r\nthere is no need to send letters to every resident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Mr Ang Mong Seng's point. I am pleased to\r\n\r\ninform  the  Member  that  HDB has  already  implemented  his\r\n\r\nsuggestion  for  SERS  sites  announced  from  October   1999\r\n\r\nonwards. Since then, the model, the preliminary design layout\r\n\r\nand  unit  floor  plans  of  the new  replacement  flats  are\r\n\r\ndisplayed at the SERS exhibition, which is held over  a  one-week period immediately after the announcement.  HDB officers\r\n\r\nare also available to answer questions from residents and HDB\r\n\r\nwould  also  conduct  a survey among the  affected  residents\r\n\r\nafter   the   SERS  announcement  and,  possibly  after   the\r\n\r\nexhibition.   It would take into account residents'  feedback\r\n\r\nbefore finalising the design layout and the actual flat  type\r\n\r\nproportion of the replacement flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang also asked whether we could extend this SERS\r\n\r\nprivilege  to the children of residents who are  affected  by\r\n\r\nSERS.   I  would like to inform him that we have a number  of\r\n\r\nprogrammes  to  promote  extended families  and  parents  and\r\n\r\nchildren to live near to each other, like the Joint Selection\r\n\r\nScheme,  Multi-Tier  Family  Scheme  and  so  on.   For  SERS\r\n\r\nprogramme, it is substantial, in terms of benefits  given  to\r\n\r\nthe  affected residents. I would ask HDB to consider  whether\r\n\r\nto  adopt  both  Dr Wang Kai Yuen's and Mr  Ang  Mong  Seng's\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  We have to balance it with the need to  be  also\r\n\r\nfair  to other Singaporeans. Certainly, it is something worth\r\n\r\nlooking into and we will let them know in due course.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Dr Wang Kai Yuen for supporting\r\n\r\nthe  SERS programme.  I agree with him that SERS is effective\r\n\r\nin  rejuvenating the older HDB estates. When SERS  was  first\r\n\r\nannounced  in  1995, the original intention was  to  announce\r\n\r\nabout  six  sites  per  year.  In view  of  the  overwhelming\r\n\r\nsupport  from the residents, we have, since 1997, accelerated\r\n\r\nthe  SERS programme. Altogether, we have announced 37  sites,\r\n\r\ninvolving  14,700  units  of  sold  flats  under  SERS.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  continue to announce  more  SERS  sites.  A\r\n\r\ncritical  factor in the selection of sites for  SERS  is  the\r\n\r\nfinancial  viability  of the proposed redevelopment.   As  Dr\r\n\r\nWang  mentioned, it must be a win-win proposal. If the  block\r\n\r\nis  already well-developed, in terms of plot ratio  and  flat\r\n\r\nsize,  it may not be financially viable. The actual  pace  of\r\n\r\nannouncement would hence depend on the number of viable sites\r\n\r\nidentified and the availability of suitable replacement sites\r\n\r\nto re-house the affected SERS residents.  As you know, one of\r\n\r\nthe  objectives  of  the  SERS  programme  is  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nresidents  to  live  in  the  same  area.   We  must  find  a\r\n\r\nreplacement site not too far away from the same area.  If  we\r\n\r\nwere  to  ask them to move very far away, then this objective\r\n\r\nof  retaining the community bond will not be met.  These  are\r\n\r\nall  the limitations.  Having said that, I know there  is  so\r\n\r\nfar  no SERS site announced in the Member's constituency  and\r\n\r\nobviously,  he is lobbying very hard for it. In view  of  the\r\n\r\nstrong support from the residents in his constituency, I will\r\n\r\nask HDB to give me good reasons to support his request.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Which party is at  fault?  Who\r\n\r\nowns  the  waterproof layer? I think we have  a  tendency  of\r\n\r\nfinding an easy way out, and we overlook to go a step further\r\n\r\nto  see  which  party should be responsible  to  rectify  the\r\n\r\nproblem.   Let  me  take  another  example.   In  a   traffic\r\n\r\naccident,  the  drivers of both cars involved  in  a  traffic\r\n\r\naccident are presumed to be in the wrong if the car in  front\r\n\r\nis  hit by a car from behind. But it could be that the driver\r\n\r\nin  the car behind was waiting but the car in front reversed,\r\n\r\nfor  whatever reason, and hit it. Then, we will take it  that\r\n\r\nboth  parties are in the wrong.  Maybe we should  go  a  step\r\n\r\nfurther, rather than just say it is an easy way out.  Why  do\r\n\r\nwe not just stick to the easy way and settle it?\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nthat  if it is established that it is due to negligence, say,\r\n\r\nfrom  renovation and so on and so forth, then there is a case\r\n\r\nto  ask the owner of the upper floor unit to pay.  But if  it\r\n\r\nis  due  to wear and tear in the course of using the flat,  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  only fair to ask both sides  to  pay,  because\r\n\r\nnaturally the owner of the upper floor unit will not want  to\r\n\r\nuse  it such that he will have to pay for the leaks.  No  one\r\n\r\nwould  want to inflict the repair cost upon himself.  In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of using the unit normally, and if there is  a  leak,\r\n\r\nbecause the structure is designed in such a way that  it  can\r\n\r\nonly  withstand a certain number of years of usage, then when\r\n\r\nit  leaks because of wear and tear, the parties that own  the\r\n\r\nstructure jointly should repair the structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister of State for\r\n\r\nhis reply.  Sir, may I now go on to my next cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the upgrading of\r\n\r\ncommercial areas in town\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentres   and   shopping  precincts  have   met   with   many\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  The reason is that when these shops were  sold\r\n\r\nto  the shopowners, they were sold under the Land Titles Act.\r\n\r\nUnder the Land Titles Act, the shopowners purchased only  the\r\n\r\nspace  inside  the shops.  The space outside the  shops,  eg,\r\n\r\ncorridors and other amenities, belongs to the HDB, and it  is\r\n\r\nrepaired  by the Town Council on behalf of the HDB.   Out  of\r\n\r\nthe  monthly  maintenance charges levied on  the  shopowners,\r\n\r\nonly  a small portion is used for renovation and repair work.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is no surplus fund to use for upgrading  the\r\n\r\ncommon  area  outside the shops.   If they want  to  upgrade,\r\n\r\nthen  they  have  to co-pay for the cost of upgrading  or  to\r\n\r\nraise funds themselves.  This has posed many difficulties for\r\n\r\nthem.   Even  if  the  majority of the  shopowners  agree  to\r\n\r\nupgrade,  there  is always a minority of  them  who  are  not\r\n\r\nwilling to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the shops were purchased, they were not given\r\n\r\nstrata  title.  Therefore, the open space outside  the  shops\r\n\r\ndoes  not  belong  to  the shopowners.  They  cannot  form  a\r\n\r\nmanagement corporation, and they cannot compel the shopowners\r\n\r\nto pay for the upgrading charges.  Therefore, if they are not\r\n\r\nwilling  to pay and simply sit tight and wait for  others  to\r\n\r\npay,  they  stand to benefit from whatever improvements  that\r\n\r\nare made, or the upgrading programme cannot be carried out at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shops were sold, the intention was that more\r\n\r\nenergetic young people would run the businesses, so that  the\r\n\r\ncommercial centres will be rejuvenated.  However,  many  shop\r\n\r\nprecincts and town centres have become shabby and old.  There\r\n\r\nis no life or vibrancy apart from some coffeeshops and hawker\r\n\r\ncentres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the shops in the town centres, HDB also built\r\n\r\nmany  shopping  complexes, eg, Hong  Lim  Green,  Bras  Basah\r\n\r\nComplex  and Rochore Centre, etc.  All these shopping centres\r\n\r\nhave flats on the upper floors and shops on the lower floors.\r\n\r\nThey  are  far  inferior to the private shopping  centres  in\r\n\r\ndesign.   The  common  complaint  is  that  the  lighting  is\r\n\r\ninadequate, the corridors are narrow, and open\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspace  is limited.  These shopping centres certainly  do  not\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  young customers.  However, these  shops  are\r\n\r\nlocated  in important urban areas.  If we leave them to  fend\r\n\r\nfor themselves, it would degenerate into a pit, and will be a\r\n\r\nwaste  of  land resources.  If these commercial  centres  are\r\n\r\nupgraded, although they are not comparable to the new private\r\n\r\nshopping  centres,  at  least we can change  their  image  to\r\n\r\nincrease the trade volume, so that they can have a chance  to\r\n\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shops at the Bras Basah Centre were sold under the\r\n\r\nLand Titles Act.  Therefore, the maintenance comes from their\r\n\r\nmonthly conservancy fees.  There is no fund to carry  out  an\r\n\r\nupgrading programme.  The shopkeepers plan to put a roof over\r\n\r\nthe  air  well, so that they are sheltered from the elements,\r\n\r\nand it can be used for promotional activities.  But they have\r\n\r\nto  pay  more than $700,000 as development charges,  and  the\r\n\r\ntotal  amounts to $1.1 million, including construction  cost.\r\n\r\nThe shopowners are unable to afford such a big sum of money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as time changes, the shops in the HDB estates are\r\n\r\nnot  able to cope with the expectation and demand of the  new\r\n\r\ngeneration customers.  Therefore, we should upgrade them  and\r\n\r\ninject  them with life, so that these places are not  wasted.\r\n\r\nBut  to  expect  them  to  pay for the  amelioration  of  the\r\n\r\nsurrounding  areas,  it is not possible  and  not  realistic.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only way is for Government to provide  funding\r\n\r\nfor  these shops to upgrade their commercial areas.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the HDB to accede to this request.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Sir, I shall be very brief on this\r\n\r\namendment  on  the  upgrading of private estates  as  we  are\r\n\r\nrunning out of time.  This subject has been answered to  some\r\n\r\nextent recently when my colleague, Mr Heng Chiang Meng, filed\r\n\r\na Question in Parliament last week.  I would just like to add\r\n\r\nthe  following questions.  What is the budget set  aside  for\r\n\r\nthis  purpose?   And is it all held under the budget  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  National  Development?   How  would  the  pilot\r\n\r\nprojects  be  selected?  What criteria will be  used  in  the\r\n\r\nselection?   Would  the MPs, with a lot  of  private  housing\r\n\r\nestates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin their constituencies, have some influence in the selection\r\n\r\nprocess?   How would the Government prioritise the  selection\r\n\r\nof items to upgrade?  I would like to suggest that the age of\r\n\r\nthe  housing estates be one key factor that should  be  taken\r\n\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I join Mr Lew's\r\n\r\ncall to upgrade our private estates and I also have a similar\r\n\r\nquestion.   But  the issue I have is how  do  we  handle  the\r\n\r\nupgrading  of  the private estates.  In the HDB estates,  the\r\n\r\ntown councils have the natural responsibility to maintain and\r\n\r\nupgrade  these  estates.  And it is going to be  a  difficult\r\n\r\nproblem  for the private estates because we do not have  this\r\n\r\nnatural organisation.  I would like to suggest that maybe  it\r\n\r\nis  about time that we considered extending the role of  town\r\n\r\ncouncils  to cover the management of the private  estates  in\r\n\r\naddition  to  the HDB estates, at least, for the  common  and\r\n\r\npublic  areas.   After  all, in each constituency,  the  town\r\n\r\nconstitutes both the HDB and the private estates.  As far  as\r\n\r\nthe MP is concerned, he has to manage all of it.  Maybe it is\r\n\r\nabout  time that we extended the role of town councils to  at\r\n\r\nleast  handle  the  upgrading as well as maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nestates effectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary for announcing last  week  that  the\r\n\r\nprivate  estates  will  be  upgraded,  and  I  join  my   two\r\n\r\ncolleagues here to make a similar appeal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the point that the GPC Chairman, Mr Lew Syn\r\n\r\nPau,  made.  What is the benchmark budget per household?   Is\r\n\r\nit  the IUP $4,000?  It should be at least the IUP amount  of\r\n\r\n$4,000  per  unit.  The problem is this.  There  will  be  no\r\n\r\neconomies  of  scale because if we take my Novena  Estate  in\r\n\r\nKreta  Ayer-Tanglin GRC, for example, we have about 100  over\r\n\r\nunits  in  that  particular estate.  If we go by  $4,000  per\r\n\r\nunit,  we  get slightly over $40,000.  This is hardly  enough\r\n\r\nfor a playground, let alone many other things.  The point  is\r\n\r\nto try and pool together the budgets of LTA,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nENV  and other agencies, maybe NParks and so on, to get  more\r\n\r\nmoney,  maybe  at  least $1/2 million to $1  million  for  an\r\n\r\nestate  size  of 100-200 units, so that there  is  sufficient\r\n\r\nmoney  to do at least the very basic minimum that is required\r\n\r\nfor  upgrading of an estate.  Otherwise, it will  be  a  half\r\n\r\nmeasure  and  it will be counter productive, and the  private\r\n\r\nestate  residents are going to be unhappy and it will reflect\r\n\r\nin our votes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to make is that RCs have meeting\r\n\r\nrooms  in  the HDB estates.  What about the NCs?  Of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  People's Association will have to look into  it  jointly\r\n\r\nwith MND, but this is something that we need to look at.   We\r\n\r\ncannot look forward to the lofty club house idea.  It will be\r\n\r\nexpensive, I am aware, but at least try and look at  the  old\r\n\r\nschools  that are not being used for the time being, renovate\r\n\r\nthem  and  let  the  NCs use them until such  time  that  the\r\n\r\nbuildings are knocked down or an ultimate use is found.  This\r\n\r\nwill   really  help.   Otherwise,  maybe  use  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres,   allocate  some  rooms,  but   there   is   already\r\n\r\ncompetition for rooms in the community centres.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is this. I think Mr Inderjit Singh asked\r\n\r\nwho would be the coordinating agency for these projects.   It\r\n\r\ncould   be   the  town  council,  but  I  think   there   are\r\n\r\nconsiderations  that  we have to take into  account,  because\r\n\r\ntown  councils already embark on a number of other areas.   I\r\n\r\nam  not  sure  whether  the  Town Councils  Act  allows  this\r\n\r\nextension  of duties.  So do we have to find an agency?   And\r\n\r\nit  has  to  be  balanced with the needs of the town  council\r\n\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point is what Mr Lew Syn Pau also made. Who\r\n\r\nwould be in the pilot scheme?  It is not for us to say but  I\r\n\r\nwould like my constituency to be first and so on.  And if  we\r\n\r\ntake  the  HDB  pilot scheme for MUP, let me be very  careful\r\n\r\nhere,  it was the choice areas that were selected for a pilot\r\n\r\nscheme.   But  I hope that when we consider the pilot  scheme\r\n\r\nfor  the  private estates, it should first have  geographical\r\n\r\ndistribution  and age, as Mr Lew Syn Pau has  mentioned,  but\r\n\r\nplease   also  consider  the  total  percentage  of   private\r\n\r\nhouseholds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas against the total households in a constituency.  And if it\r\n\r\nis  more than 50% or if there is a high figure, give them the\r\n\r\npriority,  because  we  really  need  your  help   in   this,\r\n\r\nespecially those areas like Mr Lew Syn Pau has got almost 90%\r\n\r\nof private estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> 95%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sinnakaruppan:</b> 95%. Definitely, he needs\r\n\r\nconsideration, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, at the moment, we\r\n\r\nhave  about 14% of the population or about 500,000 living  in\r\n\r\nprivate housing estates.  These include terrace houses, semi-detached houses and condominiums.  All these people living in\r\n\r\nprivate  residential estates, in proportion, pay more  income\r\n\r\ntax  and  property tax.  In terms of national  revenue,  they\r\n\r\nmake   a   great  contribution.   The  Minister  has  already\r\n\r\nannounced  that  they  will  be  included  in  the  upgrading\r\n\r\nprogramme.   But the Minister also said that only  about  two\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods will be selected for upgrading.  I think it is\r\n\r\ntoo few.  There are many private housing estates.  If we take\r\n\r\nonly two a year, how many decades do we need to complete  the\r\n\r\nupgrading programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my constituency, there are 5,000 units of private\r\n\r\nresidence in 20 neighbourhoods.  If we take two a year,  then\r\n\r\nit  will  take  10  years.  I would like to suggest  that  in\r\n\r\nselecting private estates for upgrading, the criteria  should\r\n\r\nbe  for  those  which are more than 10 years  old.   We  must\r\n\r\nencourage   the  residents  themselves  to  establish   their\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  committees to help in the  implementation  and\r\n\r\nconsultation of upgrading programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that MND should also have a budget on\r\n\r\nhow  much  every  unit would have to pay for  the  upgrading.\r\n\r\nThen  it  will  be  easier for our grassroots  organisations,\r\n\r\nresidents  committees and neighbourhood  committees  to  have\r\n\r\nmore effective planning.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, I will just ask four questions under\r\n\r\nthis cut.  (1)  What is the basis of funding for upgrading of\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nestates?  (2)  Will the upgrading be administered through the\r\n\r\nCCC?   (3)   Who  will  maintain  the  additional  facilities\r\n\r\nprovided  through  this upgrading programme?   (4)   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinistry consider setting up a private estates upgrading unit\r\n\r\nto coordinate the upgrading programme?\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze:</b> Sir, we discussed a number of ways to\r\n\r\nimprove the areas in private estates last year.  I would like\r\n\r\nnow  to identify another possibility for upgrading in private\r\n\r\nestates,  ie,  to build a  new road or road extension  as  an\r\n\r\nadditional outlet in older estates if the required  space  is\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the growth in the last 20 years, private\r\n\r\nestates have undergone many structural changes.  Many  single\r\n\r\nstorey  houses have been demolished and replaced  by  two  or\r\n\r\nthree storey houses.  Where planning regulations are allowed,\r\n\r\na  site  for a single house has been split into two or  three\r\n\r\nterrace houses.  As a result, many new houses have been built\r\n\r\neven   in  older  estates.   Consequently,  the  density   of\r\n\r\nresidence  has increased.  Also, many families  now  own  two\r\n\r\ncars  instead  of one. There are more and more  cars.   As  a\r\n\r\nconsequence, roads in older estates are congested during peak\r\n\r\nhours,  in  particular, the artery connecting the estate  and\r\n\r\nthe  main  road outside of the estate.  A way to  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem is to open up a new road linking it to the main  road\r\n\r\nto  alleviate the traffic congestion wherever possible.   And\r\n\r\nthis  will be an improvement which is badly needed in private\r\n\r\nestates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two estates in my constituency, namely, Charlton Park\r\n\r\nand Tai Keng Gardens, will illustrate the above point.  There\r\n\r\nare 600 units of terrace and semi-detached houses in Charlton\r\n\r\nPark and the only major link road to the Upper Serangoon Road\r\n\r\nis Charlton Road.  During peak hours motorists have to form a\r\n\r\nlong  queue  at  the  junction of  Charlton  Road  and  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon Road.  Tai Keng Gardens also has a similar problem.\r\n\r\nThe only linkage from the estate to the main road, Upper Paya\r\n\r\nLebar,  is Jalan Kelichap.  There were 29 houses along  Jalan\r\n\r\nKelichap and 73\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnew  houses have been added recently.  The traffic volume has\r\n\r\nincreased significantly and congestion is quite bad now.   If\r\n\r\na new road or road extension can be built, the congestion can\r\n\r\nbe substantially alleviated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must acknowledge that it is not easy to find suitable\r\n\r\nspace to build road extensions or new roads in mature estates\r\n\r\nto  join with main roads.  However, it will be an improvement\r\n\r\nhighly  desired  by  the older estate residents  if  suitable\r\n\r\nspace can be found.  And I urge the Ministry to work with the\r\n\r\nLand  Transport  Authority to identify  similar  problems  in\r\n\r\nother  older  estates and to incorporate it  as  an  item  of\r\n\r\nupgrading in private estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, the recent\r\n\r\nannouncement on the upgrading of private estates has  brought\r\n\r\ncheer to the hearts of many residents who have long felt that\r\n\r\nthey  are the forgotten children.  Having said that, I  think\r\n\r\nthere  are some questions that they would like to put to  the\r\n\r\nMinister.   First, on the scope of the upgrading  of  private\r\n\r\nestates  that  is  being  considered  -  playgrounds,  parks,\r\n\r\nwidening   of  footpaths  seem  terribly  unambitious.    The\r\n\r\nquestion  really  is,  what more can be  done  or  should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.   I  will  put  two ideas  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nconsideration.  The first is access to public  transport,  be\r\n\r\nthis in the form of additional bus routes, bus stops, or even\r\n\r\ncovered  footpaths linking to these facilities.  The  second,\r\n\r\nin terms of general community facilities where private estate\r\n\r\nresidents can organise their activities, since this is indeed\r\n\r\none   of   the  objectives  of  organising  private  estates'\r\n\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the pace of the project. Two projects in the\r\n\r\nsecond half of this year, as a pilot phase, again seems  very\r\n\r\nmodest,  since the scope of work mainly contemplated is  very\r\n\r\nbasic.   Why do we need this pilot phase?  There is  lots  of\r\n\r\nexperience  out  there in terms of upgrading playgrounds  and\r\n\r\nwidening of footpaths.  So I would like to know why we cannot\r\n\r\naccelerate  the  project  and  actually  have  several   more\r\n\r\noccurring at the same time\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  order to broaden the Ministry's own experience  with this\r\n\r\nnovel venture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, my colleagues have already mentioned the\r\n\r\nmechanism.  First, the criteria for selection of such estates\r\n\r\nand,  second,  is there scope for additional projects  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken on a co-funding basis?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, can I take my two cuts together?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, multi-storey car parks are provided\r\n\r\nfor  all  new  HDB estates instead of surface  car  parks  to\r\n\r\nmaximise land use.  But the design of multi-storey car  parks\r\n\r\ndoes  not  provide adequate elderly-friendly  features.   Car\r\n\r\nparks that are below 12.6 metre high or five storeys high are\r\n\r\nusually  not  provided  with lift.  As  a  result,  residents\r\n\r\nespecially  senior  citizens may  encounter  difficulty  when\r\n\r\ncarrying things from their cars to their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the height of the car park entrance is\r\n\r\nrestricted  to 2.15 metres.  As a result, owners  of  certain\r\n\r\nlightweight vehicles are unable to park in these  car  parks.\r\n\r\nThese  residents do not have any other alternative car parks,\r\n\r\nthus resulting in much inconvenience.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following suggestions for\r\n\r\nthe Minister to consider:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increase the height of multi-storey car parks'\r\n\r\nentrance to allow lightweight vehicles with height constraint\r\n\r\nto park.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Provide lift and ramps for all multi-storey car\r\n\r\nparks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Use solar energy to light up multi-storey car parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Increase the floor to ceiling height of multi-storey\r\n\r\ncar parks to allow better ventilation and daylighting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Install better fire safety features instead of fire\r\n\r\nextinguishers  or fire sprinkler system for multi-storey  car\r\n\r\nparks.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on my second cut about park connectors. Park\r\n\r\nconnectors  have  proven to be a success in  providing  green\r\n\r\nspaces for people to relax and keep fit.  But the progress of\r\n\r\npark   connectors'   development  has   encountered   various\r\n\r\ndifficulties   such  as  obtaining  approvals  from   various\r\n\r\nauthorities   to   construct  park  connectors   over   their\r\n\r\nrespective  land parcels.  This has resulted  in  unnecessary\r\n\r\ndelay   of   park  connectors'  development  and   also   the\r\n\r\nconstruction of disjointed park connectors, such as the  park\r\n\r\nconnector in Ulu Pandan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to promote healthy living and provide a quality\r\n\r\nliving  environment  for  Singaporeans,  I  would  urge   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  to  give high priority to expedite the construction\r\n\r\nof  park  connectors in Singapore.  Sir, I wish to  seek  the\r\n\r\nfollowing clarifications from the Ministry:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the progress of park connectors in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Can we provide more fitness facilities and toilets\r\n\r\nalong park connectors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Can the Ministry accord higher priority to construct\r\n\r\npark  connectors  within the housing estates?   For  example,\r\n\r\nthere are two neighbourhood parks in Bukit Panjang which  can\r\n\r\nbe  connected  by  a 1.2 km park connector.  This  connection\r\n\r\nwill   definitely  promote  healthy  living  and   strengthen\r\n\r\ncommunity bonding among the residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, National Parks has done a\r\n\r\nwonderful  job developing all the little pockets of  greenery\r\n\r\nall  over  the island that we Singaporeans and residents  and\r\n\r\nour  families  can escape to in our free time, mainly  during\r\n\r\nthe weekends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The really popular parks however are the big ones with\r\n\r\nfacilities  that allow people the ability to get some  active\r\n\r\nexercise  and  participate in a variety of  activities.   The\r\n\r\nEast Coast Park, for example, with its great long stretch  of\r\n\r\n20  km  of parkway is a wonderful venue for walking, jogging,\r\n\r\nin-line blading, and bicycling.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I am obviously not the only one who thinks\r\n\r\nso,  because  on most weekends, with good weather,  you  will\r\n\r\nfind  the  East Coast Park chock-a-block with people,  adults\r\n\r\nand children, in typical Singaporean style generally in total\r\n\r\ndisregard  of  staying  within  the  appropriate  walking  or\r\n\r\ncycling tracks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is very well to take a good humoured and easy\r\n\r\ngoing  approach  to  this, the truth of the  matter  is  that\r\n\r\nsometimes  it gets  dangerous because of the congestion,  and\r\n\r\nparticularly  with young  children who are totally  oblivious\r\n\r\nto  the  chaos  they create swerving unsteadily  or  stopping\r\n\r\nsuddenly   dead  in  their  tracks  in  the   middle   of   a\r\n\r\nthoroughfare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearer signage and reminders to keep people to the\r\n\r\nappropriate  tracks, simply to minimise accidents,  would  be\r\n\r\ngood.   Provisions  for in-line bladers, whose  population  I\r\n\r\nhave  watched grow by quantum leaps over the last  couple  of\r\n\r\nyears,  and who are caught in no-man's land between  cyclists\r\n\r\nand strollers, need to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A suggestion, if space is not available to create wider\r\n\r\nand  more  tracks  for different users, is  to  separate  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  going in opposite directions, that is, to have  dual\r\n\r\ncarriageways,  so to speak.  This will lessen  the  confusion\r\n\r\nand  hazards  of  the variety of types of traffic  moving  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  directions.  In other words,  you  have  different\r\n\r\ntypes of traffic but going in a single direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard particularly to facilities for in-line\r\n\r\nbladers  and  skateboarders, may I make a plea specially  for\r\n\r\nmore facilities for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have seen some senior citizens happily\r\n\r\nblading away, these two pastimes are a wonderful way  to  put\r\n\r\nthe  energies  of the group of young people,  with  what  you\r\n\r\nmight  call \"attitude\" to positive use.  I met a gentleman  a\r\n\r\ncouple of months ago who had trained a group of young bladers\r\n\r\nfor  the  National Day celebrations last year, and he  shared\r\n\r\nwith me the unstinting effort and enthusiasm these youngsters\r\n\r\nput into months of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractice and the pride they took in the enterprise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are restless young people with excess energy, and\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to occupy them in developing their skills and\r\n\r\ntaking  pride in this, and building self-esteem, is certainly\r\n\r\nworth  some  investment  of physical  resources.   Currently,\r\n\r\nthere  are  very  few  of  the  parks  that  have  facilities\r\n\r\nspecifically for  in-line bladers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure how park utilisation is measured, but I\r\n\r\nwould  like to suggest that measures of usage should  not  be\r\n\r\naveraged  over  the week, unless and until we have  staggered\r\n\r\nwork   weeks,   as  currently  poor  stressed   out   working\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, PRs, foreign talent, as well as foreign workers\r\n\r\nof  other  categories, are all out there  on  Sundays,  using\r\n\r\nevery available open space that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will take this into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc.

I will  ask  my\r\n\r\nofficers  to follow up with Members' suggestions as  well  as\r\n\r\ntheir  questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ker asked about the problems faced by tenants of\r\n\r\ncommercial centres.  This is a problem that the town  council\r\n\r\nmust   resolve   with  the  commercial  centre's   management\r\n\r\nassociation.  I will ask my HDB officers to also look at  the\r\n\r\nmany suggestions he has put forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Bras Basah Complex Merchants'\r\n\r\nAssociation, I understand  that they have yet to approach the\r\n\r\nCity  Centre  Town Council.  I hope the advisor of  the  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah Complex Merchants' Association will do so quickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the upgrading of private estates, Members have posed\r\n\r\nvarious  questions  about what the Government  is  doing  for\r\n\r\nprivate  residential estates and have made  some  suggestions\r\n\r\nlast Monday.  I was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunable  to  give specific answers to specific questions  last\r\n\r\nMonday on a question filed by Mr Heng Chiang Meng because  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  the Ministry of Finance were working  out  the\r\n\r\nfinal  details.   I  am  happy to report  this  evening  that\r\n\r\nCabinet  has since approved a budget of $10 million  for  the\r\n\r\nupgrading of private estates and this $10 million is over and\r\n\r\nabove the routine maintenance programme offered by  LTA,  ENV\r\n\r\nand  NParks  and  so  forth.   Perhaps  Mr   Singh  would  be\r\n\r\nconvinced that this Government does work at web speed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$10 million is a global budget but for individual\r\n\r\nprecincts  the  funding level would be  $4,000  per  dwelling\r\n\r\nunit.    Members would note, as Dr Ker has now very  cleverly\r\n\r\npointed  out,  that this level of funding is founded  on  the\r\n\r\nsame  basis as the IUP, in other words, the beneficiaries  of\r\n\r\nthe  private residential  dwelling estates do not need to co-pay for the improvement works.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the questions posed by the various Members, I\r\n\r\nhope  my  officers will come back to them.  I hope they  will\r\n\r\npardon  me  because  time is running  out.   There  are  many\r\n\r\nspeakers after this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question on the design guidelines with respect to\r\n\r\ncar  park usage by the elderly and disabled, their needs  are\r\n\r\ntaken  care  of by the code on barrier free accessibility  in\r\n\r\nbuildings.   In this code, the parking lots must be  provided\r\n\r\nfor  drivers and passengers with disability.

In the private\r\n\r\nhousing  market, I would like to suggest that the  Government\r\n\r\nreduces  the land set aside for landed housing and allow  for\r\n\r\nhigher density condominiums.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile  I  fully  support the Government's long-term  plan  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  greater variety of housing types and  allow  more\r\n\r\npeople  to own private housing, I believe this can be  better\r\n\r\nachieved through more innovative designs for high rise,  high\r\n\r\ndensity  housing rather than landed housing with smaller land\r\n\r\nareas  and more storeys.  The typical new landed property  is\r\n\r\nso  crammed  and has so many storeys that it is like  a  mini\r\n\r\nhigh-rise building.  When you sit in your living room of your\r\n\r\nlanded  house  and  can only look out to  a  concrete  jungle\r\n\r\noutside,  then  I  believe we are better off with  high-rise,\r\n\r\nhigh  density  housing.   The Singaporean  family  may  still\r\n\r\naspire  to  own  a  landed property but this  preference  may\r\n\r\nchange in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, with the Government actively\r\n\r\npursuing  its  policy  to attract more  foreign  talents  and\r\n\r\nworkers,  I would like to ask the Minister if there  are  any\r\n\r\nplans  in  place  to accommodate this influx  of  foreigners.\r\n\r\nWill there be a surge in demand for housing that will distort\r\n\r\nthe housing market?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I agree with Dr Wan that high\r\n\r\ndensity  housing such as condominiums would  lead  to  better\r\n\r\nland  use  as compared to landed housing.  But this does  not\r\n\r\nautomatically  mean that we do away with all  landed  housing\r\n\r\nand  set  aside land just for high density housing.  I  think\r\n\r\nthe  pleasant  fact  is that we do have sufficient  land  for\r\n\r\nboth.   In  the  first place, not every  piece  of  land  can\r\n\r\nsupport  a  very  high  density housing  development.   As  I\r\n\r\nindicated  earlier  in  my reply, there  are  many  parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  where  there  are height  constraints  because  of\r\n\r\nflight  paths,  and  so on.  Other areas,  there  are  safety\r\n\r\nbuffers   that  are  required  by  industries   for   utility\r\n\r\ninstallations.  Then, over and above that, not every area can\r\n\r\nsupport   the  high  density  housing  because  of   capacity\r\n\r\nconstraints of infrastructure and services.  By this, I  mean\r\n\r\nroads.   I  think  earlier on Dr Lily Neo already  complained\r\n\r\nthat too\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmuch high-rise housing in her constituency has given rise  to\r\n\r\ntraffic jams.  So we have to take this into account.  We have\r\n\r\nto  take  into account sewerage and drainage facilities.   So\r\n\r\nall these prevent very high density housing from taking place\r\n\r\nin the short term and in all areas.  What such constraints do\r\n\r\ncreate,  of  course, is a mixture of buildings  of  different\r\n\r\nheights.   And  I think that is not a bad thing,  because  it\r\n\r\ndoes  result  in  varied and interesting landscapes  for  our\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is on the technical side. I think equally\r\n\r\nimportant, if not more, is to recognise that Singaporeans  do\r\n\r\naspire   to  landed  housing.   There  is  a  percentage   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who do aspire to landed housing and I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould  strive  as far as possible within the constraints  of\r\n\r\nlimited  land  that  we  have,  within  the  constraints   of\r\n\r\nproviding  for  other uses, within the planning  norms  of  a\r\n\r\nhigher  population, within all these things, we should  still\r\n\r\ntry to meet people's aspirations to the best of our ability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, I think I cannot disagree with the\r\n\r\nMember  when  he  says that this preference may  change  over\r\n\r\ntime.   It  is not fixed.  As I indicated earlier, all  these\r\n\r\nplanning norms really should not be cast in stone.   We  need\r\n\r\nto  keep  a certain flexibility in our planning.  If people's\r\n\r\ntastes  change and they decide that high-rise  housing  is  a\r\n\r\ngood  alternative  and  developers are  able  to  provide  an\r\n\r\nattractive alternative to landed housing, then so be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of housing mix between low density and\r\n\r\nmedium density or between medium density and high density  is\r\n\r\nan  important issue, and this will be taken up in the current\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan review that we are undertaking.  If the  Member\r\n\r\nhas any other suggestions or views, we will be very happy  to\r\n\r\ntake them in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question about accommodation for foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and foreign talents, I think I did indicate  earlier\r\n\r\nthat we have set aside sufficient land at the moment for  the\r\n\r\nhigher population.  There\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nare many housing options readily open for the foreign workers\r\n\r\nand  foreign talents in our midst.  If you are an  employment\r\n\r\npass  holder, you can rent or you can purchase houses through\r\n\r\nthe  private housing market.  Condominiums, you do  not  need\r\n\r\napproval;  even  landed property, if you are  a  PR  and  you\r\n\r\napply,  you may be given approval.  Of course, you  can  rent\r\n\r\nrooms in HDB estates; you can rent flats from JTC; or you can\r\n\r\nbe accommodated in dormitories or boarding houses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are currently quite a lot of options available\r\n\r\nfor  these  workers  and the foreign talents.   But  we  will\r\n\r\nmonitor the demand.  As the Member indicated earlier, I think\r\n\r\nthis is something that cannot distort the housing market, and\r\n\r\ntherefore  we  will also study this as part  of  our  current\r\n\r\nConcept Plan review, as I indicated in the earlier reply.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (3), Dr Wan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head U of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code UF 2100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of GM foods has been raised by Mr Heng\r\n\r\nChiang Meng and Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay.  I would like  to\r\n\r\nraise  it again because I think it is a very important issue.\r\n\r\nFortunately, or unfortunately, GM food is here to  stay.   GM\r\n\r\nfoods,  as  far as we have gathered and known, will certainly\r\n\r\nbring  many  benefits to the world.  However,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nimportant  issue that concerns our safety and the  safety  of\r\n\r\nour  future generations.  In the longer term, who knows  what\r\n\r\nwill become of us after consuming these GM foods?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the emergence of genetically modified foods,\r\n\r\nmany  including  scientists  have  raised  concern  regarding\r\n\r\nsafety  of  consuming such foods.  They  are  also  concerned\r\n\r\nabout the long-term side effects\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  GM  foods  on the future generations and the environment.\r\n\r\nThere have been cases of GM food gone wrong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the scientists' concerns are that these GM foods\r\n\r\ncould  cause unexpected adverse effects that could result  in\r\n\r\nserious  damage to health and the environment.  Some  of  the\r\n\r\ndamaging  effects  on  health caused by  GM  foods  are  food\r\n\r\nallergy, antibiotic resistance and introduction of new toxins\r\n\r\nin the food.  In many cases, the problems are only discovered\r\n\r\nafter people get sick.  The new toxins and allergens in these\r\n\r\nnon-food  sources could cause serious damage to  us  and  our\r\n\r\nchildren.   These are real concerns that we need to seriously\r\n\r\nconsider,  especially  in view of the  introduction  and  the\r\n\r\ninflux of these foods into Singapore consumer market.  Hence,\r\n\r\nI would like to ask the Minister whether the foods introduced\r\n\r\ninto  the  Singapore  market are  safe  and  for  large-scale\r\n\r\nconsumption,  and  whether tests have  been  carried  out  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  these GM foods would not bring  ill  health  or\r\n\r\nallergy or even trigger long-term side effects as a result of\r\n\r\nprolonged continuous consumption.  I would also like to  know\r\n\r\nwhether there is an appropriate national regulatory framework\r\n\r\nestablished  to ensure that strict bio-safety procedures  and\r\n\r\nmeasures are observed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for the Environment in his reply had said\r\n\r\nthat  the  assessment had got to be rational.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.  But if we do not have facts about GM foods nor its long-term  effects,  how  can we be rational  in  our  assessment?\r\n\r\nUnder  the circumstances, I think it is better to err on  the\r\n\r\nside  of  caution.  Perhaps, I still believe labelling  might\r\n\r\nnot  be  such  a bad idea and costs should not  be  the  main\r\n\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, Dr Wan raised the subject\r\n\r\nof  GM  food.  GM food is not new but, of course, the concern\r\n\r\nis  real.  GM food has been around for many years in the form\r\n\r\nof  soya  beans, corn and canola oil.  Such GM food has  been\r\n\r\napproved  for  sale  in major countries,  such  as  USA,  EU,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  Canada  and Japan, after extensive  toxicity  and\r\n\r\nallergenicity tests as well as animal and field trials.  This\r\n\r\nis to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure that they are safe for consumption and have no adverse\r\n\r\nimpact on the environment.  In fact, GM food is generally put\r\n\r\nunder more stringent safety scrutiny than conventional non-GM\r\n\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-date, there is no evidence of adverse long-term\r\n\r\nhealth  effects of consuming such approved GM food.  But  the\r\n\r\nconcern is still there of such a new kind of food and how  do\r\n\r\nwe  control their import and use.  To oversee and advise  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  GM products, a Genetic Modification  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee,  or  GMAC,  has  been formed.   The  Committee  is\r\n\r\nchaired  by Prof. Lim Pin who is the Vice-Chancellor  of  NUS\r\n\r\nwith  members from various agencies, including PPD,  ENV  and\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health.  GMAC has established a set of bio-safety\r\n\r\nguidelines on the release of agriculture related GM products.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  mechanism  to  regulate  GM  product  such  as\r\n\r\nlabelling and so on, has yet to be worked out.  While we  can\r\n\r\nban  GM  products that have been scientifically shown  to  be\r\n\r\nunsafe  for  consumption or detrimental to  the  environment,\r\n\r\nestablished  by the advanced countries, or even  by  our  own\r\n\r\ntests,  the issue of mandatory declaration of all GM products\r\n\r\nand  their  derivatives at import is complex as  it  involves\r\n\r\nmany    factors,    including    trade    implications    and\r\n\r\nenforceability.   These issues have been clearly  debated  at\r\n\r\ninternational  forums, but there has  yet  to  be  any  clear\r\n\r\ninternational  direction.  GMAC is closely  monitoring  world\r\n\r\ntrends  on  the regulation of GM products before  making  its\r\n\r\nrecommendations to the Government.  So there  is  a  national\r\n\r\nagency  that  is  looking after that.  In the  meantime,  any\r\n\r\nproduce found to be unsafe for consumption or harmful to  the\r\n\r\nenvironment based on toxicity tests and allergenicity  tests,\r\n\r\nand  so on, whether genetically modified, or otherwise, would\r\n\r\nbe banned from import or consumption.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wan Soon Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wan Soon Bee:</b> I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (4), Mr Chiam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\ngiving  me the opportunity to speak.

Sir, the HDB imposes a levy on the resale of flats  at\r\n\r\n20%  or 22% depending on the size of the flats.  The levy can\r\n\r\nsometimes amount to $20,000 or $30,000, which are large  sums\r\n\r\nof  money.   Lessees of HDB flats who sell their flats  after\r\n\r\nstaying  in them for 10-20 years are angry that the HDB  also\r\n\r\nwants  to  make part of the money.  HDB flats bought  in  the\r\n\r\nearly years have all greatly appreciated in prices.  A 3-room\r\n\r\nflat bought at, say, $9,500 can be sold 20 years later for at\r\n\r\nleast  $130,000.  The HDB does not allow the seller  to  make\r\n\r\nall  the money but imposes a 20% levy, which is about $26,000\r\n\r\nfor  the amount that I have just mentioned for the flat sold.\r\n\r\nThe  $26,000,  if  not deducted as a levy,  would  have  been\r\n\r\nearned by the seller.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the example given, the profit of $94,500 with\r\n\r\ndeduction  for levy seems a lot of money.  But it is  not  so\r\n\r\nbecause  prices  of  HDB flats have risen  greatly  over  the\r\n\r\nyears.   In this case, if the seller wants to upgrade himself\r\n\r\nto  buy  a 4-room flat, he probably has to pay half  of  that\r\n\r\namount  which he has earned as the required 20% down  payment\r\n\r\nand  the  other  half  is used for renovation  of  the  newly\r\n\r\npurchased flat.  The net result is that he makes no profit at\r\n\r\nall.   All the profits, minus the levy, are paid back to  the\r\n\r\nHDB when he buys a 4-room flat from the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the levy imposed by the HDB tantamounts to a\r\n\r\ncapital  gains tax.  Singapore has no capital  gains  tax  on\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperties.  Why does the Government allow HDB to impose such\r\n\r\na  tax  in respect of the sale of the flat?  I know what  the\r\n\r\nHDB  will  say.   HDB  will  say  that  the  flats  sold  are\r\n\r\nsubsidised  and it is right for them to impose  a  levy.   My\r\n\r\nanswer is that the levy is in effect a capital gains tax, and\r\n\r\nit  has nothing to do with the subsidy.  If the HDB wants  to\r\n\r\nclaim that the flats are subsidised, then the levy should  be\r\n\r\nbased   on  the  original  subsidised  price,  and  not   the\r\n\r\nappreciated selling price.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on HDB's bias against the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  When I was elected into Parliament in 1984, soon\r\n\r\nafter that, the HDB walled up a void deck space for me to use\r\n\r\nit as my MP's office.  In the 1991 general election, a record\r\n\r\nof  four  Opposition  MPs were elected.   Suddenly,  the  HDB\r\n\r\nannounced  that  it  was not going to provide  all  MPs  with\r\n\r\noffices  in  their premises.  My MP's office at Potong  Pasir\r\n\r\nwas  demolished within half a day and the place was  restored\r\n\r\nto  its  original condition, not a trace of  my  former  MP's\r\n\r\noffice  existed.   I had no room to hold my weekly  meet-the-people session.  I had no choice but to hold them at the void\r\n\r\ndeck in the open.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mind to meet my residents in the open if the\r\n\r\nmeeting  was just for a chit chat, or for a social gathering.\r\n\r\nBut  the  weekly meet-the-people sessions are for a  business\r\n\r\npurpose,  ie,  the  business  of  the  residents.  They  have\r\n\r\nproblems which they need to tell their MP and for which  they\r\n\r\nwant their MP to help them on those problems.  Those problems\r\n\r\nare  often  very  private  matters and  are  confidential  in\r\n\r\nnature.   Therefore, there is a need for  privacy  when  such\r\n\r\nmatters are dealt with.  As it now stands, I have to meet the\r\n\r\nresidents  to hear their very private problems in  the  open.\r\n\r\nThe  only  thing I have is a cloth screen which is not  sound\r\n\r\nproof.   I would like to request the HDB again to wall  up  a\r\n\r\nspace  for  me in the void deck so as to provide me  with  an\r\n\r\nMP's office.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last time I made the request it was refused. I\r\n\r\nknow  the  HDB has provided all PAP MPs with proper rooms  in\r\n\r\nthe void decks of HDB flats to be used as their MPs'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffices.  In the case of my constituency at Potong Pasir, the\r\n\r\nHDB  has provided Andy Gan, the prospective PAP candidate who\r\n\r\nis not even an MP.  He has a proper office, equipped with air\r\n\r\nconditioning  and  computers,  to  hold  his  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions.  Whereas I, a duly elected MP, am left in the  open\r\n\r\nto  hold my meet-the-people sessions.  I hope the HDB  should\r\n\r\nimmediately  stop  its discrimination and  bias  against  the\r\n\r\nOpposition MPs and provide them the same facilities as  those\r\n\r\nof the PAP MPs at the void decks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my third cut is on change of HDB rules. The\r\n\r\nfrequent  change of rules by the HDB is well known.   Lessees\r\n\r\nof  HDB  do  not mind the frequent changes if the changes  of\r\n\r\nrules  do not affect them materially.  In one instance, HDB's\r\n\r\nchange  of  rules in regard to the residence period  affected\r\n\r\nlessees materially.  At first, the HDB said that you have  to\r\n\r\nstay  five years in a flat before you can sell it in the open\r\n\r\nmarket.   Then suddenly, the HDB says, \"No, you  cannot  sell\r\n\r\nthe  flat after staying for five years.  You have now to stay\r\n\r\nfor 10 years before you can sell the flat.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have known of one case where this couple has\r\n\r\npurchased a flat and hoping to stay there for five years  and\r\n\r\nafter that, to sell it so that they could upgrade to a bigger\r\n\r\nflat.  But before the five years' residence period is up, the\r\n\r\nHDB  changed its rule to make the waiting period to 10 years.\r\n\r\nIn  such  instances, the HDB, in my view, has  acted  in  bad\r\n\r\nfaith.   The  HDB, after making a representation  to  lessees\r\n\r\nthat they can sell their flats after staying in them for five\r\n\r\nyears,  is wrong in not allowing them to do so at the end  of\r\n\r\nfive  years.  Sir, I hope that in future, when HDB does  make\r\n\r\nsuch  material change, it should give clear cut-off dates  so\r\n\r\nthat the existing lessees do not suffer.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I move this\r\n\r\namendment  to  highlight a problem that we encounter  at  our\r\n\r\nmeet-the people sessions.  A majority of our HDB dwellers get\r\n\r\nalong with each other pretty well.  However, occasionally, we\r\n\r\ndo  come across some HDB residents who are inconsiderate  and\r\n\r\nthey cause problems to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nothers.   I am sure you must have many instances of residents\r\n\r\ncoming  to your meet-the-people session to complain how  some\r\n\r\nresidents just throw the rubbish along the corridor right  in\r\n\r\nfront  of  somebody's flat, or making a big nuisance  in  the\r\n\r\nevening when they come back at 11 pm and blast the radio very\r\n\r\nloud.   There  are so many instances, and I do  not  want  to\r\n\r\nquote all of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When such complaints are received, usually the MPs, the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees and even the police are all  involved.\r\n\r\nThey  will  try  to settle the dispute. Very  few  times,  we\r\n\r\nsucceed; most times, we fail.  I think it is not fair that we\r\n\r\nshould  allow  these  inconsiderate residents  to  even  stay\r\n\r\nthere.   I  am  sure HDB has a lot of rules  to  protect  the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the majority.  I wonder whether  HDB  has  ever\r\n\r\nevicted any resident who has been found guilty by a court, if\r\n\r\nhe  is caught for misconduct.  I want to find out whether HDB\r\n\r\nhas ever evicted such a resident.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no such rules, is it not time for such a\r\n\r\nruling  to be imposed to ensure harmony in the neighbourhood?\r\n\r\nI  know it is a very, very serious thing.  Perhaps, HDB could\r\n\r\nbuy  back the flat from the offender and bar him from  buying\r\n\r\nor  renting  a HDB flat for perhaps five years.  I  think  we\r\n\r\nshould not allow all these inconsiderate residents to make  a\r\n\r\nnuisance of themselves and make life very difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nresidents of HDB dwellers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, Mr Chiam has come back\r\n\r\non  the  HDB resale levy a bit late because my colleague,  Dr\r\n\r\nVasoo, raised it some time ago, and I have convinced Dr Vasoo\r\n\r\nto  look at the right picture and he agreed with me that  the\r\n\r\nresale  levy  was  necessary.   But,  nevertheless,  I   will\r\n\r\nreiterate the main points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-90s, many upgraders took advantage of the\r\n\r\nbouyant property market to cash in on the existing HDB  flats\r\n\r\nand  apply  to buy another subsidised flat from the  HDB,  in\r\n\r\nother words, a second flat.  As a result, HDB's waiting  list\r\n\r\nballooned to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  like 150,000 at the peak in 1997.  With  upgraders\r\n\r\nmaking  up  52%  of the applicants, what this means  is  that\r\n\r\nupgraders are depriving first-timers of an opportunity for  a\r\n\r\nfirst flat.  Is this fair?  The answer must be \"no\".\r\n\r\n<br>6.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to address this problem, HDB implemented this\r\n\r\nresale  levy.  But in doing so, HDB was mindful of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  families that live in smaller flats, ie,  3-room  flats\r\n\r\nand   4-room   flats  should  not  be  unduly  disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  we pitched the resale levy such that for  smaller\r\n\r\nflats,  the resale levy is smaller. For example, for a 2-room\r\n\r\nflat,  the resale levy is 15%; a 3-room flat, 20%;  a  4-room\r\n\r\nflat,  22.5%, and a 5-room flat, we pitched it at  25%.   One\r\n\r\ndoes not need to pay the resale levy unless one goes back  to\r\n\r\nthe  HDB  for a second subsidised flat.  This is fair because\r\n\r\nthe upgrader already has his first flat.  He has lived in the\r\n\r\nfirst  flat  for some years. He has enjoyed the benefits.  He\r\n\r\nhas  now  cashed  in his capital gains, and  he  must  decide\r\n\r\nwhether  he  wants to pay the resale levy and  get  a  second\r\n\r\nsubsidised flat, or he can buy a resale flat with the capital\r\n\r\ngains and still have some money in the pocket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam quoted the example of a 3-room flat which was\r\n\r\nsold  by the HDB to the owner a long time ago at a low price.\r\n\r\nFor this owner, the resale levy is reasonable.  If I read him\r\n\r\ncorrectly, Mr Chiam pointed out that for a person who  bought\r\n\r\na 3-room flat or a 4-room flat in the 1980s or even 1990s, he\r\n\r\nor she may not find the resale levy acceptable because in the\r\n\r\n1980s  and 1990s, HDB sold these flats at much higher  prices\r\n\r\nthan  the  flats  sold in the 1960s and  1970s.   I  have  an\r\n\r\nexample of a 4-room flat owner. The HDB sold this flat to a 4-room  flat  owner  in 1992 in Toa Payoh. At  that  time,  the\r\n\r\nselling price was $160,000. Today, the resale price for  this\r\n\r\n4-room flat or its equivalent in Toa Payoh is something  like\r\n\r\n$375,000. If you factor in the resale levy of 22.5% for a  4-room  flat,  that  comes to $84,000.  If you  take  $375,000,\r\n\r\nwhich  is the price of a resale flat today, minus the  resale\r\n\r\nlevy of $84,000, this resident has a profit of $290,000.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noriginal selling price by HDB to this owner was $160,000,  so\r\n\r\nhe  has a capital gain of $130,000 which is tax-free. On this\r\n\r\ncount,  even  if he pays the resale levy upfront,  he  has  a\r\n\r\ncapital gain of $130,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose now he wants to upgrade and go for a direct\r\n\r\npurchase of a HDB flat in the same locality in Toa Payoh, the\r\n\r\nselling  price  of  a new 5-room flat now is  something  like\r\n\r\n$347,000.   The  resale price of a 5-room equivalent  in  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  is  today half a million dollars.  The market subsidy,\r\n\r\nwhich  this owner will get if he were to go to HDB to  get  a\r\n\r\nnew  flat, is something like $125,000.  If he pays the resale\r\n\r\nlevy  of  $84,000, he still gets a second subsidy of  $41,000\r\n\r\nwhich  is  substantial.  Either way is  a  win-win  for  this\r\n\r\nowner.   When  he sells, he gets a capital gain, tax-free  of\r\n\r\n$130,000.   He goes to the HDB, buys a new flat  and  gets  a\r\n\r\nsecond market subsidy of $41,000, no doubt a reduced one.   I\r\n\r\ndo  not know how Mr Chiam See Tong has come to the conclusion\r\n\r\nthat the resale levy penalises Singaporeans.  It reduces  the\r\n\r\nmarket  subsidy for the upgrader but it in no way takes  away\r\n\r\nhis second subsidy. I hope he is convinced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong claims that HDB provides PAP MPs with\r\n\r\nfree  meet-the-people  session  office.   This  is  factually\r\n\r\nincorrect.   PAP MPs run their meet-the-people sessions  from\r\n\r\nthe  PCF education centres. The HDB rents the void deck space\r\n\r\nto  the  PCF  at  a concession rate because PCF  is  doing  a\r\n\r\ncommunity service. Mr Chiam can also set up his own PCF if he\r\n\r\nforms his own educational foundation under section 29 of  the\r\n\r\nCompanies  Act, and HDB will similarly rent him a  void  deck\r\n\r\nspace  and  his  political party can rent  a  room  from  his\r\n\r\neducation  centre, provided the education  foundation  has  a\r\n\r\npaid-up capital of $5 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Could the Senior Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  clarify what are the criteria for eligibility  for\r\n\r\nconcession from HDB?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Mr Chiam has got it factually  wrong  the\r\n\r\nthird  time when he quoted the example where a resident could\r\n\r\nnot sell his flat after five years of occupation in his flat.\r\n\r\nNo,  he can still sell the flat after five years' occupation,\r\n\r\nbut  he cannot go to HDB and register for a second new  flat.\r\n\r\nHe  can  only  do that if he has served up a ten-year  period\r\n\r\nfrom the time he took possession of his first flat.  All  HDB\r\n\r\nrules  are  fairly  applied across the board.   It  does  not\r\n\r\ndiscriminate  between party, creed or race.

That is my first point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second part is: is PCF not an educational facility?\r\n\r\nIf  it is an educational facility, is it a charity?  If it is\r\n\r\na charity, the premises must be used for charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nCan  you  say that PAP MPs are using those premises only  for\r\n\r\ncharitable  purposes?  The other point  is:  can  the  Senior\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary say for sure that if the  Opposition\r\n\r\ndo apply, the HDB will have its premises open to them if they\r\n\r\ncan raise $5 million?

The  networks will achieve  better  coordination\r\n\r\nbetween  the  acute  hospitals,  national  centres  and   the\r\n\r\npolyclinics.   With  the  setting  up  of  so  many   medical\r\n\r\nestablishments,  it  makes sense to  try  to  coordinate  the\r\n\r\nactivities  for  these centres providing different  types  of\r\n\r\nmedical care.  I am, however, concerned with the six national\r\n\r\ncentres  which  have been established over the  years.  These\r\n\r\ninclude\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Eye Centre, Oncology and Heart Centres, and so on.  While\r\n\r\nit is good that specialties be concentrated in these centres,\r\n\r\nthere are several perceived disadvantages.  The first is  the\r\n\r\ncoordination  with the acute hospitals. Patients,  especially\r\n\r\nolder ones, do not suffer from just one ailment.  They may be\r\n\r\nafflicted with multiple illnesses. How do we ensure that  all\r\n\r\nthe  expertise  is brought to bear to effect total  treatment\r\n\r\nwithout  having to refer to specialists residing in different\r\n\r\nplaces or, worse still, refer the patients from hospitals  to\r\n\r\nthese national centres and vice versa?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the national centres, being new buildings, give\r\n\r\nthe  impression  that  they  are very  expensive  affairs.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  patients  referred to these  centres  by  private\r\n\r\npractitioners have to pay \"A\" class charges. Some of them may\r\n\r\nnot  be  able to afford these charges because they  may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  referred to by GPs in housing estates.  Even  with  the\r\n\r\npublic hospital network, there may be occasions when patients\r\n\r\nare  levied  higher  charges had they  been  treated  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals themselves.  I hope that this is only a perception,\r\n\r\nbut there could be possibilities that eventually, the medical\r\n\r\ncost will rise because of these increased charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in the event that more national centres are to\r\n\r\nbe  set  up,  acute hospitals may be deprived of  the  entire\r\n\r\nrange of specialties to render total treatment. This will add\r\n\r\nto  the so-called to-ing and fro-ing of patients between  the\r\n\r\nhospitals  and  the  centres.   I  would  like  to  have  the\r\n\r\nMinister's comments on these several areas of concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We have got one minute left.
