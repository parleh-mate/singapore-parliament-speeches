This  crisis has  been  caused  by  the\r\n\r\noutbreak  of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  or  SARS.\r\n\r\nSeveral  senior  doctors  told  me  that  they  have  not\r\n\r\nexperienced  anything like this in the last 40-50  years.\r\n\r\nThe  SARS  outbreak  can destroy the  capability  of  our\r\n\r\nnational  healthcare system if it is not  contained.   It\r\n\r\ncan have wide and severe repercussions on many sectors of\r\n\r\nour economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SARS outbreak can be very pernicious because\r\n\r\nSARS is likely to be more infectious when the patient  is\r\n\r\nmore  ill.  And the patient is likely to be most ill when\r\n\r\nhe  is  in  the  hospital.  Once a  group  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  is  infected  by SARS in the  hospital,  it  can\r\n\r\nspread  quickly  within  the  hospital.   In  Hanoi   and\r\n\r\nBeijing, they have had to take the very drastic  step  of\r\n\r\nclosing  down  the  affected hospital, keeping  everybody\r\n\r\nwithin  the  hospital, in order to stop the  transmission\r\n\r\ninto the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when SARS is contained, it will take a heavy\r\n\r\ntoll  on  the  healthcare  system.   SARS  will  place  a\r\n\r\ndisproportionate demand on ICU facilities  and  isolation\r\n\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is doing its utmost to control the\r\n\r\nSARS  outbreak  in  Singapore.   However,  we  need   the\r\n\r\ncooperation of all Singaporeans in this battle.  Until we\r\n\r\nhave reliable and effective diagnostic tests, our doctors\r\n\r\nhave  to depend on two main criteria to assess whether  a\r\n\r\nperson  has  SARS.   First, the clinical  symptoms,  like\r\n\r\nfever, cough, muscle aches and chills, which can be  very\r\n\r\nnon-specific.   Second, the contact  or  travel  history.\r\n\r\nWith global travel and the complex web of interactions in\r\n\r\na  modern bustling city, establishing contact history  is\r\n\r\nnot  an  easy  task unless the patient  is  truthful  and\r\n\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a patient admitted to a hospital does not tell\r\n\r\nthe truth about his contact or travel history, he may not\r\n\r\nbe  categorised as a suspect case and may not be isolated\r\n\r\nquickly.    As  a  result,  the  infection   can   spread\r\n\r\nthroughout the hospital.  If a person with a fever sees a\r\n\r\ngeneral practitioner and lies about his contact or travel\r\n\r\nhistory, he may not be referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital\r\n\r\nand he goes on to infect others in the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act provides for the control\r\n\r\nand  prevention  of  infectious  diseases  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nToday,  I  propose  new amendments to the  Act,  to  give\r\n\r\nadditional and necessary powers to the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nto  control the outbreak of SARS in Singapore.  The  main\r\n\r\nspecific\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovisions cover five key areas: Home Quarantine  Orders,\r\n\r\nthe  quarantine  of premises, the prevention  of  persons\r\n\r\nfrom  acting  irresponsibly which  cause  the  infectious\r\n\r\ndisease   to  spread,  compliance  with  disease  control\r\n\r\nmeasures  and the handling of bodies of deceased  persons\r\n\r\nwho are suspected to have SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Home Quarantine</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the first area which is home\r\n\r\nquarantine.  It is important that all persons  with  SARS\r\n\r\nare  identified early and isolated for treatment  at  the\r\n\r\nTan  Tock Seng Hospital.  This will minimise transmission\r\n\r\nof  the  disease  to other people.  We also  impose  Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Orders  on contacts of  patients  with  SARS.\r\n\r\nAlthough asymptomatic contacts of SARS patients are well,\r\n\r\nthe  imposition of home quarantine allows us to  pick  up\r\n\r\ncases  of  SARS  much  earlier  and  prevents  them  from\r\n\r\ninfecting  others in the community.  Home  quarantine  is\r\n\r\ntherefore a key measure to prevent community transmission\r\n\r\nof  SARS  in  Singapore.   If people  placed  under  home\r\n\r\nquarantine   disregard   their  quarantine,   they   risk\r\n\r\ninfecting   others  in  the  community.   Clearly,   this\r\n\r\nendangers the public health and we must not allow this to\r\n\r\nhappen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin with, the amended Act will make the legal\r\n\r\nprocess   of  issuing  Home  Quarantine  Orders  clearer.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  Home  Quarantine  Orders  are  issued   under\r\n\r\nsection 15(1) of the Infectious Diseases Act which allows\r\n\r\nany  person  who is or who is suspected  to  be  a  case,\r\n\r\ncarrier  or  contact  of  an  infectious  disease  to  be\r\n\r\ndetained  and  isolated  in a hospital  or  any  suitable\r\n\r\nplace.  Section 15(2) of the current Act that deals  with\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of  home quarantine can only  be  applied  to\r\n\r\npersons  who  are  suffering from an infectious  disease.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we cannot compound a fine if a person breaks\r\n\r\nhome quarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill will amend the Act to allow a\r\n\r\nperson  who is, or who is suspected to be a case, carrier\r\n\r\nor  contact  of  an infectious disease  or  has  recently\r\n\r\nrecovered from an infectious disease or has been  treated\r\n\r\nfor an infectious disease\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be  quarantined in his home.  He will  also  have  to\r\n\r\nfollow  the  conditions which are  applied  to  him  with\r\n\r\nrespect to his quarantine.  One of these conditions  will\r\n\r\nbe  to  wear  an  electronic wrist tag if he  breaks  his\r\n\r\nquarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tighten the control on persons who are put on\r\n\r\nhome  quarantine, the amendment will make it  an  offence\r\n\r\nfor  persons  to break home quarantine or  to  refuse  to\r\n\r\ncomply with any condition applied to the quarantine.  The\r\n\r\noffence  will then be compounded by my Ministry.  Persons\r\n\r\nwho  break their quarantine may also be arrested  by  the\r\n\r\npolice or authorised Health Officers and be detained in a\r\n\r\nhospital  or  other appropriate place and be required  to\r\n\r\nundergo  necessary  medical examinations  and  treatment.\r\n\r\nRepeat  offenders can also be referred to the courts  and\r\n\r\nthe  courts will take his previous offences under the Act\r\n\r\ninto account in sentencing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Isolation area</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the second area which is the\r\n\r\nisolation  area.   Clause 7 of  the  Bill  will  give  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  new powers to quarantine any premises  for  the\r\n\r\npurposes  of controlling or preventing the spread  of  an\r\n\r\ninfectious   disease.   This  will  be   accompanied   by\r\n\r\nnecessary  powers to make specific orders in relation  to\r\n\r\nthe   restriction   of  persons  or  goods   within   the\r\n\r\nquarantined  premises as well as powers to authorise  the\r\n\r\ndestruction, disposal or treatment of goods,  structures,\r\n\r\nwater  supply,  drainage, sewerage system  or  any  other\r\n\r\nmatter  known  or suspected to be a source of  infection.\r\n\r\nThis  section is included in the Act as a contingency  to\r\n\r\ncater  for  a scenario like that of the Amoy  Gardens  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Civic responsibility</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area that I would like to talk about is\r\n\r\ncivic  responsibility. Mr Speaker Sir, to prevent persons\r\n\r\nfrom behaving irresponsibly and endangering the health of\r\n\r\nothers,  the Bill proposes a new section to be  added  to\r\n\r\nthe  Infectious  Diseases Act to  prohibit  certain  acts\r\n\r\nwhich  are  liable  to  expose  others  to  the  risk  of\r\n\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnder  this new provision, a person who knows or suspects\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  suffering an infectious  disease  must  not\r\n\r\nexpose  others  to  the  risk of  the  infection  by  his\r\n\r\npresence in a public place.  The only exception  to  this\r\n\r\nis when he is seeking medical treatment.  However, if the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Medical Services has designated  a  specific\r\n\r\nplace for the medical treatment of the infectious disease\r\n\r\nconcerned,  then  the person must seek treatment  in  the\r\n\r\nplace   specified.   This  provision  only   applies   to\r\n\r\ninfectious  diseases which are specified in a  new  Fifth\r\n\r\nSchedule.   SARS  will  be the first  infectious  disease\r\n\r\nlisted in the Fifth Schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had, in an open letter to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans on 22nd April, quoted two examples  of  such\r\n\r\nirresponsible behaviour.  The first case was  the  family\r\n\r\nof  eight who is related to the 72-year man who works  at\r\n\r\nthe   Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale  Centre.   Despite  being\r\n\r\ninstructed by the doctor to remain where they were  while\r\n\r\nwaiting  for the ambulance to arrive, they removed  their\r\n\r\nmasks  and  wandered off to a nearby food  centre  and  a\r\n\r\nChinese  medical hall.  The other case was  the  man  who\r\n\r\nvisited a GP clinic, a polyclinic and two sinsehs  before\r\n\r\ngoing  to  Changi General Hospital.  He should  not  have\r\n\r\ngone to so many places to seek treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our battle against SARS, we need a higher level\r\n\r\nof   social   discipline   and   social   responsibility.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must  have  the  confidence   that   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  not  commit irresponsible  acts  that\r\n\r\nexpose  others to the risk of infection.   Clause 8  sets\r\n\r\nout the provisions to ensure that this is so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Refusal to cooperate and providing false information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is on refusal to cooperate and\r\n\r\nproviding false information.  My Ministry's officers have\r\n\r\nencountered  several  instances when  persons  refuse  to\r\n\r\ncooperate, eg, by refusing to answer telephone  calls  or\r\n\r\ntelling  our  officers not to bother them.  Some  persons\r\n\r\neven\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide  misleading  or  false  information.   Clause  16\r\n\r\namends  section 64 of the Act to make it  an  offence  to\r\n\r\nrefuse to cooperate with disease control measures and  to\r\n\r\nprovide  false  or  misleading  information.   Under  the\r\n\r\namended  Act, the first offence carries a fine of  up  to\r\n\r\n$10,000  and/or a prison term of up to 6 months  and  for\r\n\r\nsubsequent offences, the fine is up to $20,000  and/or  a\r\n\r\nprison term of up to 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wakes  and disposal of corpses of persons with infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next area is on disposal of corpses of persons\r\n\r\nwith  infectious diseases.  To protect the public health,\r\n\r\nsection  14  of the Infectious Diseases Act empowers  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services to impose conditions for the\r\n\r\ncollection,  removal and disposal  of  the  body  of  any\r\n\r\ndeceased  person who has died from an infectious disease.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have patients who die in hospital before  a\r\n\r\ndiagnosis of SARS can be made.  There are also  some  who\r\n\r\nmay have died from another medical condition, eg, a heart\r\n\r\nattack  or  cancer, but doctors cannot totally exclude  a\r\n\r\nconcurrent  SARS  infection.   This  is  because  we  now\r\n\r\nrecognise that SARS can present in very atypical ways  in\r\n\r\nsome patients with other chronic conditions and that SARS\r\n\r\ninfection  can  also be superimposed on  other  forms  of\r\n\r\nbacterial   infection.    The  diagnostic   methods   for\r\n\r\ncoronavirus  which  are  currently  available   are   not\r\n\r\nsensitive enough to exclude a diagnosis of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in some cases, there is not enough clinical\r\n\r\nevidence for a diagnosis of SARS to be made but  yet  the\r\n\r\ndoctors  cannot completely rule it out.  Let us consider,\r\n\r\nas  an  example, an elderly patient with multiple medical\r\n\r\nproblems  and  a  bronchopneumonia  due  to  a  bacterial\r\n\r\ninfection, confirmed on laboratory testing.  The  patient\r\n\r\nalso  has a history of contact with a SARS patient.  When\r\n\r\nsuch  a  patient  dies, the cause of death  will  not  be\r\n\r\nattributed to SARS, since bacterial bronchopneumonia is a\r\n\r\ncommon  and  well-recognised  cause  of  death  in   such\r\n\r\npatients.  However, in line with our very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncautious approach to SARS, as a precautionary measure  to\r\n\r\nminimise the risk to those who are handling the body, MOH\r\n\r\nwill  treat such cases as potentially infectious and  the\r\n\r\ndeath to be treated in the same way as a SARS death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Infectious Diseases Act currently has no\r\n\r\nprovision to empower the Director of Medical Services  to\r\n\r\nissue directives for the disposal of bodies of those  who\r\n\r\nare only suspected to have an infectious disease.  Clause\r\n\r\n5 will amend section 14 of the Act to allow directives to\r\n\r\nbe  issued by my Ministry on how the body of the deceased\r\n\r\nis  to be disposed of even when the diagnosis of SARS  is\r\n\r\nonly suspected.  In addition, the Ministry can also issue\r\n\r\ndirectives  to  disallow  funeral  wakes,  if  necessary.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply with the directive will be an offence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to this, clause 4 will also amend the Act to\r\n\r\nallow  the  Ministry to require a post-mortem on  persons\r\n\r\nwho  were suspected of being a carrier or contact  of  an\r\n\r\ninfectious  disease  if  this  is  deemed  necessary   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate an outbreak of an infectious disease or  help\r\n\r\nto prevent its spread.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Increase in penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the section on increase in\r\n\r\npenalties.  The provisions under the Infectious  Diseases\r\n\r\nAct  have  been  enacted after careful  consideration  in\r\n\r\norder  to protect the public health.  Offences under  the\r\n\r\nAct are serious and can potentially endanger the lives of\r\n\r\nmany people.  We want to impress upon all Singaporeans of\r\n\r\nthe  seriousness  with which we take  the  protection  of\r\n\r\npublic  health.   The Bill amends the Act  to  raise  the\r\n\r\ngeneral penalty for those who commit an offence under the\r\n\r\nAct from $5,000 to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for a term\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding  6  months  for  the  first  offence  upon\r\n\r\nconviction  and  in the case of a second conviction,  the\r\n\r\npenalty  has  been raised to $20,000 and/or  imprisonment\r\n\r\nfor  a  term  not exceeding 12 months.  My Ministry  will\r\n\r\ncompound any offence by home quarantine breakers and the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noffender  will  be  required to pay a sum  not  exceeding\r\n\r\n$5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the other provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Medical examination</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health may need to require not just\r\n\r\npersons  who are suffering from an infectious disease  or\r\n\r\nwho  are  contacts of such infected persons to undergo  a\r\n\r\nmedical examination in order to prevent the spread of the\r\n\r\ndisease.   Clause 3 will amend section 8 of  the  Act  to\r\n\r\nenable  my  Ministry  to  also require  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nsuspected  to  be contacts of persons with an  infectious\r\n\r\ndisease  or  carriers to undergo medical examination,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.   This  will  enable  us  to  implement   more\r\n\r\nstringent  measures, if necessary, to prevent the  spread\r\n\r\nof infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Issue  of  directives  to health  care  institutions  and\r\n\r\nmedical clinics</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Act only allows the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nto  issue  directives for the investigation of infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases and for the treatment of infected persons.  This\r\n\r\nhas  limited  the  Ministry from  issuing  directives  to\r\n\r\nhealthcare  institutions  and  clinics  under  the   Act.\r\n\r\nClause  4  of the Bill will amend the Act to  allow  such\r\n\r\ndirectives to be also issued to prevent the spread of  an\r\n\r\ninfectious disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Information from patients and medical practitioners</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of investigating outbreaks or\r\n\r\nsuspected   outbreaks  of  infectious  disease,   or   in\r\n\r\npreventing the spread of such disease, clause 4 read with\r\n\r\nclause  16 will also amend the Act to allow the  Director\r\n\r\nof  Medical Services to require medical practitioners  to\r\n\r\nobtain   necessary  information  from  his  patient   and\r\n\r\ntransmit this information to the Ministry of Health.   It\r\n\r\nwill  be  an offence for the patient to refuse to provide\r\n\r\nthe   information  required  or  to  provide  false   and\r\n\r\nmisleading information.  This will help\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Health to obtain essential and  accurate\r\n\r\ninformation when required so that control measures can be\r\n\r\ntaken  quickly  to contain the spread of  any  infectious\r\n\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Disclosure of information</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill will also amend the Act to\r\n\r\nallow  the  Director  of  Medical  Services  to  disclose\r\n\r\ninformation obtained under the Act to any person if  this\r\n\r\nis  necessary  to  prevent the spread of  the  infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases as specified in a new Sixth Schedule.   SARS  is\r\n\r\nthe  first disease to be included in this Sixth Schedule.\r\n\r\nI  would like to reassure Members of this House that  the\r\n\r\namended  Act  will  only  allow such  information  to  be\r\n\r\ntransmitted  to  enable  the implementation  of  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  are  necessary to prevent the spread of infectious\r\n\r\ndiseases.  These measures must also be permitted  by  the\r\n\r\nDirector of Medical Services.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, SARS is a clear and present danger\r\n\r\nto  the  health of all Singaporeans.  We must be able  to\r\n\r\nact  swiftly  and decisively to prevent and  contain  its\r\n\r\nspread.   In  the future, there may also be outbreaks  of\r\n\r\nother infectious diseases, both known and new, which  may\r\n\r\nagain   threaten   the  health  of   Singaporeans.    The\r\n\r\namendments to the Infectious Diseases Act will enable the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health to do whatever it can to protect  the\r\n\r\nhealth of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand\r\n\r\nto speak in support of the Infections Diseases (Amendment\r\n\r\nNo. 2) Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (or SARS) has\r\n\r\nswept over us like a hurricane leaving a trail of damage,\r\n\r\nuprooting us and having us still finding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  own  feet.  After decades of bliss without  perilous\r\n\r\ndiseases  and just when we are finding delight  with  our\r\n\r\nmedical  and  technological advancements,  our  globe  is\r\n\r\nsuddenly  seized  by  a new microbe having  a  field  day\r\n\r\ndisrupting our lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is of grave concern to us as there is no\r\n\r\ntreatment  for  it  right now and  there  is  no  vaccine\r\n\r\nagainst  it.   Many people can be affected  by  just  one\r\n\r\nafflicted  person causing a ceaseless chain of  reactions\r\n\r\nif  left unabated.  The only weapon we can have is to try\r\n\r\nand  contain  it.   We need to stop the  spread  of  SARS\r\n\r\nurgently  and  quickly before it gets out of  hand.   The\r\n\r\nfailure  in  this will not only cause loss of many  lives\r\n\r\nand   turmoil   amongst  our  people  but  also   serious\r\n\r\nrepercussions on our economic and social structures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fight against SARS involves the cooperation of\r\n\r\nthe whole community in being civic-minded and courageous.\r\n\r\nThe  involvement of the community as stakeholders who are\r\n\r\nvulnerable  cannot be over-emphasised.  Sir,  although  I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  the majority of Singaporeans are responsible,\r\n\r\nsensible  and law-abiding citizens, this Bill to  address\r\n\r\nthe misdemeanor of some black sheep is necessary and very\r\n\r\ntimely.   This time, a few black sheep can  cost  us  our\r\n\r\nbattle  against SARS.  We really have no  choice  but  to\r\n\r\nhave   strict   enforcement  of  punishment   upon   SARS\r\n\r\nquarantine  breakers for the containment of  the  disease\r\n\r\nand  the  protection  of  the  community  at  large.   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, we have to win this war at all  costs  for\r\n\r\nour survival as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successful implementation of Home Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders  is  important  to regain the  confidence  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  let  them revert to normalcy  knowing  their\r\n\r\nchances of getting SARS from the community is low.   This\r\n\r\nwill certainly give our economy a big boost and, in time,\r\n\r\nwill also bring back the tourists and foreign businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, I welcome stricter\r\n\r\nenforcement of Home Quarantine Orders.  But I would  like\r\n\r\nto  stress that we must ensure that undue hardship should\r\n\r\nnot\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbefall those under quarantine.  We need to help them tide\r\n\r\nthrough  the  ill-effects  of  being  quarantined.    For\r\n\r\nexample,  their daily delivery of food or their need  for\r\n\r\nany   urgent  errands  could  be  facilitated.   We  must\r\n\r\nremember  that some families may not have family  members\r\n\r\nor  friends  to  assist them.  May  I  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether there are agencies that can look into these basic\r\n\r\nneeds of these households?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although those under quarantine can claim $70 a day,\r\n\r\nwhat  considerations are we planning for those who suffer\r\n\r\nsubstantial direct losses, such as those from  the  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Wholesale Centre who lost their perishable goods?\r\n\r\nSir,  in  spite of the Minister for Health's announcement\r\n\r\nthat  financial assistance will be provided so that  they\r\n\r\ncan   maintain  their  families  and  workers,  and   the\r\n\r\nannouncement by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday  that\r\n\r\nthey will be compensated for the loss of their goods, can\r\n\r\nwe  ensure  that Home Quarantine Orders do not cause  any\r\n\r\nbankruptcy or loss of livelihood for those quarantined?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people under quarantine must be better equipped\r\n\r\nwith knowledge on how to protect their family members and\r\n\r\nrelatives  from infection and on the sort of  help  (like\r\n\r\navailability of the free ambulances) they can get if they\r\n\r\nshould  fall  sick  themselves.  Some of  the  quarantine\r\n\r\ncases   may  need  urgent  medical  attention  for  other\r\n\r\nconditions  such as gastritis, severe arthritis  pain  or\r\n\r\neven  delivery  of their babies.  Which  hospital  do  we\r\n\r\nadvise these patients to go to?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to reiterate that many are fearful\r\n\r\nof going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital thinking that they may\r\n\r\nget infected there instead of getting better.  We need to\r\n\r\nallay  people's fear of Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  and  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health needs to step up education  in  this\r\n\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we need to also increase education on\r\n\r\nvarious  aspects  of  SARS,  reaching  out  to  as   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as possible.  This is the hallmark  of  our\r\n\r\nsuccess  in  our battle against SARS as many  people  may\r\n\r\nstill be ignorant about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSARS leading to unnecessary behaviour or paranoia.  It is\r\n\r\nimportant to get knowledge about the disease, such as how\r\n\r\nit  is spread and how to detect its early stages and  how\r\n\r\nto  seek  early treatment for a better chance of recovery\r\n\r\nand  so on, to everyone.  We can reduce people's fear  if\r\n\r\nthey  know  how  to protect themselves and  their  family\r\n\r\nmembers more rationally and effectively.  The \"crisis  of\r\n\r\nfear\" that Prime Minister alluded to would be lessened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the infectivity of SARS, any legal\r\n\r\nsanction  may  be  ineffective  as  long  as  the  actual\r\n\r\nphysical  movement of the quarantined individual  is  not\r\n\r\nrigorously  curtailed.  It will be poor consolation  that\r\n\r\nwe  are able to impose a fine or even a jail sentence  at\r\n\r\nsome later stage.  Will the Minister, therefore, consider\r\n\r\ntagging all quarantined individuals for better compliance\r\n\r\nand better monitoring to ensure success?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who would be jailed, it has been announced\r\n\r\nthat  a  section of the Selarang Park Drug Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre  is being prepared for this purpose.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  those who are jailed do  not  endanger  the\r\n\r\nhealth  of other inmates.  Sir, nobody should be deprived\r\n\r\nof  medical care.  Therefore, should they fall sick, will\r\n\r\nthey  be transferred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital?   Is  Tan\r\n\r\nTock Seng Hospital going to be made secure to treat them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the successful control of SARS must be coupled\r\n\r\nwith the avoidance of import of new cases.  I raised  the\r\n\r\nneed  to  have the rights of implementation of compulsory\r\n\r\nstatutory  declaration for travellers during  the  Second\r\n\r\nReading of the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) Bill  last\r\n\r\nmonth.   I had asked whether we could implement a  clause\r\n\r\non  entry declaration for travellers by way of subsidiary\r\n\r\nlegislation as it had not been provided in the Infectious\r\n\r\nDiseases  Act.  The case of the British manager  who  had\r\n\r\ndisappeared,  despite being issued  with  the  quarantine\r\n\r\norder  in Indonesia, will be an example of the importance\r\n\r\nof such a compulsory entry declaration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the legal sanctions in false declaration of the\r\n\r\nforms,  the penalty must be backed up by law.  Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  form  must  be  clear  and  unambiguous.   Will  the\r\n\r\nMinister consider introducing this measure?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new section 21A(2) of the Bill is rather vague\r\n\r\non  the  use of the phrase \"person having the care\".   It\r\n\r\nreads, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A person having the care of another person whom he\r\n\r\nknows  or  has reason to suspect is a case or carrier  or\r\n\r\ncontact of a disease set out in the Fifth Schedule  shall\r\n\r\nnot  cause or permit that person to expose other  persons\r\n\r\nto  the  risk  of infection by that person's presence  or\r\n\r\nconduct in any such place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister to clarify if such a person\r\n\r\ncomprises  the family members, domestic maids,  teachers,\r\n\r\nchildcare  personnel  and all the medical  professionals,\r\n\r\nsuch as sinsehs, nurses and doctors?  Furthermore, how do\r\n\r\nthese  persons  carry  out this requirement  if  that  is\r\n\r\nagainst  the  wish  of their care?  I hope  the  Minister\r\n\r\ncould enlighten me on these points.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will now call upon Dr Tan Cheng Bock\r\n\r\nto address this House from his home via video.  Dr Tan.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  for letting me participate in this  debate  and\r\n\r\nthe trouble taken to get me connected to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important Bill because it seeks to amend\r\n\r\nthe Infectious Diseases Act to ensure Singaporeans comply\r\n\r\nwith the various measures taken to combat a disease,  the\r\n\r\nspread of SARS.  We must take these measures seriously or\r\n\r\nSARS will spread fast.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a new disease, a new virus, an unknown virus,\r\n\r\nit  changes  itself quickly and you do not know  how,  or\r\n\r\nwhen, or where it will strike.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you, Mr Speaker, Sir, a personal\r\n\r\nexperience.  There was this man doing his usual chore  of\r\n\r\ndelivering\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvegetables  to  the market when he suddenly  developed  a\r\n\r\nfever.   He never thought much about it because he  never\r\n\r\nstepped  out  of the country.  He consulted  me  on  15th\r\n\r\nApril  and I advised him to monitor his temperature daily\r\n\r\nin  view  of the current SARS situation.  The  next  day,\r\n\r\nover  the phone, he told my nurse, after some hesitation,\r\n\r\nhis  temperature was normal and told her not to worry  as\r\n\r\nhe has no SARS.  We did not hear from him till 21st April\r\n\r\nwhen the Ministry of Health official called to inform  me\r\n\r\nthat  the  patient died of SARS.  When I saw  him,  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Wholesale Centre was not a SARS cluster.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, every fever patient who sees a\r\n\r\ndoctor  is  worried that he or she might get  SARS.   The\r\n\r\nconnotation of having SARS carries with it a stigma  and,\r\n\r\nworse  still, that he or she is going to die.  They  want\r\n\r\nto  avoid hospitals because getting referred there is, to\r\n\r\nthem,  like  a  death  sentence.   This  is  because  our\r\n\r\ntelevision  and  press coverage only  shows  patients  in\r\n\r\nintensive  care unit with tubes shoved into their  noses,\r\n\r\nmouths  and  limbs.  This is a poor image of the  problem\r\n\r\nand enhances the fear factor even more.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like yesterday in Parliament, the Health Minister\r\n\r\ninformed  this House the recovery rate is more than  90%.\r\n\r\nSo  highlighting the death case and those in ICU are  not\r\n\r\nhelpful  in calming the anxieties of Singaporeans.   With\r\n\r\nyour  permission,  Sir,  I  have  circulated  a  clinical\r\n\r\npicture of the SARS to reinforce the Minister's point and\r\n\r\nto  better  inform the House and the public so that  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  better understanding of this disease.   In  this\r\n\r\nchart,  you will notice the infectivity is none, or  very\r\n\r\nlow, in the incubation period and the infectivity of  the\r\n\r\ncases  rises from low during the prodrome stage  to  very\r\n\r\nhigh during the lower respiratory stage.  So Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmust seek treatment to ensure 90% cure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that there are no more new healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  being  infected at Tan Tock Seng Hospital  shows\r\n\r\nthat  the transmission is halted or dramatically reduced.\r\n\r\nThe  strict  isolation  and  barrier  nursing  techniques\r\n\r\n(mask, glove, gown)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  been effective and Singaporeans need not fear going\r\n\r\nto TTSH.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern is sometimes patients do not tell doctors\r\n\r\nthe truth about their travels or about their exposure  to\r\n\r\nSARS  contact or even their correct temperature  readings\r\n\r\nbecause of denial or stigmatisation.  All these are borne\r\n\r\nout  of  fear, and the Prime Minister was right  when  he\r\n\r\nspoke at length about it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I personally experienced it when I was informed by\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health of the patient I saw  who  later\r\n\r\ndied  of  SARS.  I worried about my loved ones, I worried\r\n\r\nabout my grandson who is so close to me and who had spent\r\n\r\nthe  whole Sunday playing with me, I worried about almost\r\n\r\neverything.   Even  my heart beat was faster  than  usual\r\n\r\nwith a few dropped beats and my temperature even shot  up\r\n\r\nto 37.6, but I soon took control of myself and decided to\r\n\r\nfight against it, if ever I get infected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I even called MOS Ng Eng Hen when my temperature was\r\n\r\n37.6  and  he informed Dr Lim Suet Wun of Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital  about my case.  I was prepared  for  the  worst\r\n\r\ncase  scenario;  by  then,  it  was  not  fear  but   the\r\n\r\ndetermination to fight.  So far, I am symptom-free and my\r\n\r\ntemperature is constantly below 37 degrees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when we fear the unknown, we cannot\r\n\r\nthink  straight and we tend to do the worst.  I think  my\r\n\r\npatient  was  not  truthful  in  telling  my  nurse   his\r\n\r\ntemperature  the next day because of his  hesitation  and\r\n\r\nsaying not to worry, \"I have no SARS.\"  On retrospect,  I\r\n\r\ncan see it was a clear sign of denial.  As for myself,  I\r\n\r\ndecided  to  stay  isolated at home  and  monitor  myself\r\n\r\ncarefully with temperature taking very frequently.   This\r\n\r\nis  because  of social obligation I owe to my family,  my\r\n\r\nfriends and my colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My patients and my doctor colleagues' patients fear\r\n\r\nhospitals,  they  fear the nurses, the doctors  who  come\r\n\r\ninto contact with SARS patients.  Can we blame them?  No.\r\n\r\nWe must manage their fear and fear is the one factor that\r\n\r\nis  going  to  work  against our  effort  to  check  this\r\n\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPM's   concern  on  this  fact  was  televised  for   all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are therefore fighting two fronts: one, the SARS\r\n\r\nitself, and, two, the psychological battle of winning the\r\n\r\nminds  of  the people that we must unite and isolate  the\r\n\r\nvirus, instead of letting the virus isolate us.  Now  the\r\n\r\nvirus   is   isolating  us,  restricting  our  lifestyle,\r\n\r\ndamaging  the  economy and causing untold damage  to  the\r\n\r\ntourist industry, our hotels and restaurants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill before us is to close the gaps and to\r\n\r\nreinforce  our efforts to isolate the virus.   It  is  to\r\n\r\neducate  and  police effectively the current measures  of\r\n\r\ncontrol  taken by identifying index cases, case  tracing,\r\n\r\nisolation, ringfencing and quarantine.  Where  are  these\r\n\r\ngaps?   Some  of  these  are: not telling  the  truth  to\r\n\r\ndoctors about travel, not obeying quarantine orders,  not\r\n\r\nreporting the temperature level truthfully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take me, for example. I isolated myself. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  I  want  to close this gap of  potential  spread\r\n\r\nshould  I become infected.  It is a social responsibility\r\n\r\nsince  I know that close contact and respiratory droplets\r\n\r\nspread the virus.  Similarly, all Singaporeans must  take\r\n\r\ntheir  own  responsibility  seriously,  strictly  and  be\r\n\r\ndisciplined, and not to be angry when the nurse calls you\r\n\r\nto  check.   In  fact, a nurse Rohana just called  me  to\r\n\r\ncheck  whether  I was all right when I was  writing  this\r\n\r\nspeech.  I thanked her and I praised her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have achieved good results at the\r\n\r\nhospitals, the situation at the community is going to  be\r\n\r\ndifferent.  This is because the community like the  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Wholesale Centre is not a controlled environment.\r\n\r\nWe  are dealing with a mixed batch of constituents.   And\r\n\r\nthis is where our communication must be clear, exact  and\r\n\r\nprecise to calm, to inform and to instruct people how  to\r\n\r\ncomply or we might end up punishing wrong people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many Singaporeans are taking\r\n\r\ntemperatures   at   schools,   kindergartens,   childcare\r\n\r\ncentres,  workplaces  and even at homes.   This  is  wise\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntemperature is the only certain and consistent clue  that\r\n\r\nthis virus gave us, so we must jump on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the temperature taking lies the problem. What\r\n\r\nto  do if the temperature is more than 37, more than  38,\r\n\r\nmore  than 39?  Now, they send all these to the  GPs  and\r\n\r\npolyclinic  doctors, but is this the right  thing?   SARS\r\n\r\nmay  be  spread  this way.  I think we must  improve  the\r\n\r\nguidelines  given to Singaporeans at large.  The  doctors\r\n\r\nknow  what  to do because the guidelines given  are  very\r\n\r\nclear and good though, at the practical level, we doctors\r\n\r\ndo face problems because of the confines of limited space\r\n\r\nto  do  a  triage  of  our patients,  who  also  come  at\r\n\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we know that, so far, temperature is the most\r\n\r\nreliable indicator, we must work on it and capitalise  on\r\n\r\nit.  We have a wide network of polyclinics and hospitals.\r\n\r\nI am proposing to the Minister to consider the setting up\r\n\r\nof   fever   screening  centres  close   to   many   such\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  These centres should be set apart from the\r\n\r\nmain  hospital buildings and not in the building  itself.\r\n\r\nThis is important, because of the fear factor of going to\r\n\r\nhospitals or polyclinics.  These fever screening  centres\r\n\r\nshould  be a stand-alone tentage, like the one I  saw  on\r\n\r\ntelevision,   at  Alexandra  Hospital.   It   should   be\r\n\r\nconvenient,  with a pleasing ambience, and not  hard  and\r\n\r\nnot too cold.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do at such screening centres? Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  at  this  point,  I  hope  that  the  Clerk  of\r\n\r\nParliament  has distributed the second chart to  all  the\r\n\r\nMembers  of  Parliament.  Let me also review  what  I  am\r\n\r\nhoping  the  Minister would consider the fever  screening\r\n\r\ncentres.  All Singaporeans who are involved in monitoring\r\n\r\ntemperatures in the various schools, kindergartens,  work\r\n\r\nplaces  and child-care centres must know of such  centres\r\n\r\nclosest  to their schools, etc, and must be clear  as  to\r\n\r\nwhat to do.  It is no use sending all fever cases to  GPs\r\n\r\nto get a letter stating that the person is free from SARS\r\n\r\nand, therefore, can attend school or work, as is what  is\r\n\r\nhappening.  GPs do not have the ability to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfirm or to detect SARS.  At GP clinics, there  lies  a\r\n\r\ndanger  of  spreading  the virus  because  of  the  small\r\n\r\nwaiting room and the air-conditioned environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, if a SARS case happens at the clinic,\r\n\r\nthere   is  the  unpleasant  task  of  quarantining   and\r\n\r\ndisrupting their way of life.  The SARS patient I saw was\r\n\r\nexposed  to six other patients at the waiting room.   All\r\n\r\nwere   under  Home  Quarantine  Orders,  and  they   were\r\n\r\nnaturally  unhappy.   Therefore,  sending  all   feverish\r\n\r\npatients  to GPs is not the right thing.  What we  should\r\n\r\ndo is to clearly tell the temperature operators:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Send all those with less than 38 degrees\r\n\r\ncentigrade to see their own  doctor,  with  clear,  precise \r\n\r\nreferral letters  given.  I take 38 degrees centigrade \r\n\r\nbecause that is the reference temperature given;  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Send all those with more than 38 degrees\r\n\r\ncentigrade to a fever screening  centre, again with a \r\n\r\nletter  of  direct referral.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fever screening centre, there can be a proper\r\n\r\ntriage  to  sieve  out the potential  SARS  and  non-SARS\r\n\r\ncases.   Do  not have too much red tape at the  screening\r\n\r\ncentre, which should also be open to all who want  to  be\r\n\r\nscreened,  eg,  taxi  drivers,  housewives,  etc.   There\r\n\r\nshould be little or no red tape, as I said, and it should\r\n\r\nalso  welcome walk-in patients and serve also as  a  SARS\r\n\r\ninformation  centre.   Of course,  the  centres  must  be\r\n\r\nmanned by doctors and nurses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One symptom of SARS is body ache. So, many\r\n\r\nacupuncturists are treating all these body aches, without\r\n\r\nrealising that they could be treating SARS patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to prevent the spread of SARS, we\r\n\r\nneed the utmost cooperation, understanding, and action on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  each and every Singaporean.  Our  personal\r\n\r\nneeds  have to be put aside to give way to the wider  and\r\n\r\nbigger  need of the general population, ie, the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontain an unknown enemy, or the latter would disrupt and\r\n\r\neven  destroy  the very fabric of our society.   Most,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve, will comply; some, out of ignorance, have to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  informed and helped to comply; while some  will  need\r\n\r\nthe  law  to  come down hard on them to  make  sure  they\r\n\r\ncomply.   This  piece of legislation will  have  all  the\r\n\r\nclout to make sure that all fall in line in this battle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, SARS has grown from a medical  problem  to\r\n\r\nbecome  an  economic problem.  It has also grown  from  a\r\n\r\nregional  problem to a global problem.  Like  most  viral\r\n\r\ndiseases, an effective cure for SARS is not likely to  be\r\n\r\nimminent.   Preventive and supportive treatment  are  key\r\n\r\nmeasures  in  the fight against SARS.  For us  to  combat\r\n\r\nthis SARS epidemic, the key to success is prevention  and\r\n\r\ncontainment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the SARS outbreak, the Government has put in\r\n\r\nplace  many  precautionary measures.  In  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nsector,  several  measures have been imposed,  and  these\r\n\r\nmeasures have become increasingly stringent.  Many of the\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers who are in the forefront of  fighting\r\n\r\nSARS  are people whom I have known, not just in terms  of\r\n\r\nwork  but  many  of  them have been  doctor  friends  for\r\n\r\ndecades  or several years.  And I can tell you  that  all\r\n\r\nthese  people  really deserve our respect and  admiration\r\n\r\nbecause of all the risks that they take.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It hurts the healthcare workers even more when they\r\n\r\nhave to manage their own, especially those who are in the\r\n\r\npink of health.  When I was told that an ex-colleague  of\r\n\r\nmine, Dr Lee in NUH, was admitted for SARS, my friends in\r\n\r\nTan  Tock  Seng  Hospital told me that he had  difficulty\r\n\r\nbreathing,  and he actually requested for intubation.   I\r\n\r\nwas  glad to hear yesterday, when I met another colleague\r\n\r\nof mine, that he had been extubated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of SARS has taken a heavy toll on the\r\n\r\nhealthcare workers.  Despite the strain on our healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers,  I  wish  to  assure  the  Government  that  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare personnel are in full support of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nGovernment's  measures.  In fact, we  will  welcome  even\r\n\r\nmore draconian measures to break this cycle of the spread\r\n\r\nof infection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also welcome the move by the Ministry to ask\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers from overseas, especially nurses,  to\r\n\r\navoid staying together with healthcare workers from other\r\n\r\nhospitals.   However, some of them are bound  by  tenancy\r\n\r\nagreements.   It  is  a  right move.   But  I  think  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  and the hospitals may want to consider offering\r\n\r\nassistance in helping them with a relocation exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, in addition to healthcare measures taken\r\n\r\nin  healthcare facilities, I think health education is of\r\n\r\nutmost  importance  in  helping Singapore  contain  SARS.\r\n\r\nSARS  is a serious disease, but I think we must not over-react.   The likelihood of dying from a heart  attack  is\r\n\r\nmuch  higher than the likelihood of dying from SARS  when\r\n\r\nyou  have  a  heart attack and, therefore, one  must  put\r\n\r\nthese fears in the right perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the public should adopt preventive measures,\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would  like to call the 3Hs.  The  first  H  is\r\n\r\nhealth.   We  have a responsibility to keep ourselves  in\r\n\r\ngood  health.   The second H is hygiene.  We  must  adopt\r\n\r\ngood  hygiene practices like washing hands,  keeping  the\r\n\r\nenvironment  clean, and avoiding indiscriminate  disposal\r\n\r\nof  tissues  or  other types of waste  that  may  contain\r\n\r\ngerms.  The third H is habit.  We must adopt good habits.\r\n\r\nIt  is  time  Singaporeans adopted the habit  of  wearing\r\n\r\nmasks  whenever they feel unwell, or are down with  fever\r\n\r\nor cough.  This is to minimise the spreading of infection\r\n\r\nto  others.   It  is  also a good habit  to  check  one's\r\n\r\ntemperature when one is unwell, so that the fever can  be\r\n\r\ndetected early.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whether it is masks, thermometers or hand\r\n\r\nwashes,  one  must use them appropriately.  A  friend  of\r\n\r\nmine  told me that she had observed a school bus carrying\r\n\r\npre-school children who were probably five or  six  years\r\n\r\nold.   A  few  of these children in the school  bus  were\r\n\r\nwearing masks.  They took them off to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshow  them to each other and, subsequently, tried on each\r\n\r\nother's  masks.   In this instance, the masks  would  not\r\n\r\nonly  not  prevent  disease but would certainly  help  to\r\n\r\nspread  infection.  A friend of mine also told  me  about\r\n\r\nsitting  next  to  a  gentleman at the  airport  who  was\r\n\r\ndiligently wearing his mask.  But, whenever he wanted  to\r\n\r\ncough,  he  would lift up his mask and cough  into  other\r\n\r\npeople's  face.  This defeats the purpose  of  wearing  a\r\n\r\nmask  in  public.   The main aim is actually  to  prevent\r\n\r\ninfection to others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important public measure is screening\r\n\r\nat  all  entry and exit points in Singapore.   Currently,\r\n\r\nthose   from   SARS-affected  countries   are   screened.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a SARS-affected person enters through a  non-SARS  country,  he  would not be screened  at  the  entry\r\n\r\npoint.  One must understand that thermal screening  is  a\r\n\r\nvery useful tool.  Nevertheless, even if you have a fever\r\n\r\nand  you  are in an air-conditioned environment, you  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  picked up on the thermal screen and, of  course,\r\n\r\nmost airplanes are air-conditioned and most airports  are\r\n\r\nair-conditioned too.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A patient of mine gave me another example. He\r\n\r\nattended  a  conference where there were  delegates  from\r\n\r\nHong  Kong,  and this conference was held  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nThe  delegate from Hong Kong flew to Indonesia, and  then\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.   The  Hong Kong  attendees  who  flew  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  were not screened.  So he asked me whether  it\r\n\r\nwould  defeat the whole purpose of trying to screen those\r\n\r\nfrom  the  high-incidence countries, if we did not  close\r\n\r\nthis loophole.  I think we should protect this as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On quarantine, those who break their quarantine\r\n\r\norders  are irresponsible and they endanger the lives  of\r\n\r\nfellow citizens.  I support the Government's measures  on\r\n\r\nquarantine.   In  fact, I am in favour of more  draconian\r\n\r\nmeasures.  The current quarantine allows people to  visit\r\n\r\nthose  who are home quarantined, and there is a  risk  of\r\n\r\nspread of the disease if the person eventually turns  out\r\n\r\nto have SARS.  We should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseriously    consider   having   designated    quarantine\r\n\r\nfacilities.   Perhaps even one of our off-shore  islands,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Pulau  Ubin, may be made a  quarantine  centre.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that there will not be any visitors  for\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  quarantined, and the likelihood  of  the\r\n\r\ndisease spreading will be significantly reduced.  We  may\r\n\r\neven consider mandating that those on quarantine put on a\r\n\r\nmask at all times, perhaps except during meals, to reduce\r\n\r\nthe likelihood of spread during the quarantine period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must understand the seriousness of the\r\n\r\nimpact of SARS on Singapore.  If we do not take draconian\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  inconvenience a few, the economic  fall-out\r\n\r\nwill  be  so  severe that all Singaporeans will  have  to\r\n\r\nsuffer both financially and medically.  I do not think we\r\n\r\nshould be quibbling about how much compensation to  give,\r\n\r\nbut  we  should  pull together to make Singapore  a  safe\r\n\r\nplace.  Only then can the economy improve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, the media plays an important\r\n\r\nrole,  as it has given extensive coverage on SARS,  which\r\n\r\nis  a step in the right direction.  However, the coverage\r\n\r\nis  so extensive that it appears to others that the whole\r\n\r\ncountry  is  paralysed by SARS, and that the  only  thing\r\n\r\nthat   is  newsworthy  and  occupies  the  time  of  most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is SARS.  A friend of mine  who  came  back\r\n\r\nfrom the US recently told me that when he was back in the\r\n\r\nUS  and he watched the American news broadcasts, it would\r\n\r\nappear   to  those  watching  that  Singapore  was   very\r\n\r\nseriously affected by SARS and that Singapore appeared to\r\n\r\nbe the main source of SARS.  On the first day when he was\r\n\r\nback and he watched the news, the American news broadcast\r\n\r\nfocused on SARS and Singapore.  When he watched it on the\r\n\r\nsecond  day, again, it was SARS and Singapore.   When  he\r\n\r\nwatched  it  on the third day, it was SARS and  Singapore\r\n\r\nand, by the way, Hong Kong also has some SARS cases.  So,\r\n\r\nthe  impression given to viewers then was that  the  SARS\r\n\r\nproblem  appears  to  be  mainly in  Singapore  and  that\r\n\r\nSingapore was the source for SARS.  This is certainly not\r\n\r\nthe case.  In fact, other relatives from the US\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  called their relatives here to tell them  the  same\r\n\r\nthing   as  well  and,  of  course,  fortunately,   their\r\n\r\nrelatives here have told them that this is not the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the media can play an extremely\r\n\r\nimportant  role in dispelling irrational  fear  and  also\r\n\r\nfocusing  on the positive aspects of SARS, on how  people\r\n\r\nhave  recovered successfully.  And I think the media  can\r\n\r\nalso focus on public education messages, such us using  a\r\n\r\nmask when one is sick, how to put a mask on properly  and\r\n\r\nhow  to take temperature.  You may laugh at some of these\r\n\r\nmeasures,  but let me just tell you what  one  of  my  MP\r\n\r\ncolleagues told me. At the screening at a hawker  centre,\r\n\r\nhe  asked to look at the temperatures recorded for  those\r\n\r\nwho  were  taken at the hawker centre.  The  temperatures\r\n\r\nwere  about  33-34 degrees centigrade.   If  we  were  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  those  temperatures, all these people  would  be\r\n\r\ndead!   So,  while we want to encourage  people  to  take\r\n\r\ntemperature, it is important that we educate them  as  to\r\n\r\nhow  to  take it properly so that the exercise is useful.\r\n\r\nI  believe that the media can certainly play an extremely\r\n\r\nimportant role in this public education exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS will become a disease that will be found in\r\n\r\nmany countries throughout the world.  By taking draconian\r\n\r\nbut rational measures, the Singapore Government, with the\r\n\r\nfull  support  of its people, will be able to  accomplish\r\n\r\nthe  aim of making Singapore the safest place to live and\r\n\r\nwork in in this era of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br>2.33 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the DPM and other hon. Members have\r\n\r\npaid  tribute to the doctors, nurses and other healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers in combating SARS.  Sir, allow me now, on  behalf\r\n\r\nof  my Party, the Singapore People's Party, to also thank\r\n\r\nand   pay  tribute  to  the  nurses,  doctors  and  other\r\n\r\nhealthcare  workers of Tan Tock Seng Hospital,  Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital (SGH), Changi General Hospital and  all\r\n\r\nother hospitals\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand clinics in Singapore for the heroic and splendid work\r\n\r\nthey  are  doing, and putting themselves in the frontline\r\n\r\nin  detecting and caring for patients who are affected by\r\n\r\nthe  Severe  Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS)  disease.\r\n\r\nSir, we thank them all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is perhaps the worst disease to have hit\r\n\r\nSingapore  to-date.  It has killed about 14-16 people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore and caused untold sufferings, both in terms  of\r\n\r\nthe  sickness and to our economy, especially the  retail,\r\n\r\ntravel and tourism business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely that this Bill is put before\r\n\r\nParliament.  I support this Bill in-principle.  I say \"in-principle\" because, if its purpose is just to combat SARS\r\n\r\nand   other   similar  infectious  diseases,   then   the\r\n\r\nprovisions  in  the Bill may have gone  too  far.   I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  clause  24  of  the  Infectious   Diseases\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill where it repeals the old section 55  and\r\n\r\nreplaces  it with a new section 55 with seven subsections\r\n\r\ncomprising 20 paragraphs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand why the Director wants to enter,\r\n\r\ninspect  and  search any premises or  any  conveyance  in\r\n\r\nwhich  an outbreak or a suspected outbreak of the disease\r\n\r\nhas  taken  place,  or to take samples of  substances  or\r\n\r\nmatter  or  food.   But  I do not understand  why  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  for the Director to be given powers  to  force\r\n\r\nany  person  to  produce  for  inspection  any  books  or\r\n\r\ndocuments  within his custody or possession.   The  whole\r\n\r\nexercise of looking at books and documents may lead to an\r\n\r\nincome  tax  or  custom  and excise  duty  offence  being\r\n\r\ndiscovered.  These offences have got nothing to  do  with\r\n\r\nthe  health of the person investigated.  I think the  net\r\n\r\nthrown by this Act is too wide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If people can be given the impression that the\r\n\r\noccurrence  of SARS has been taken advantage  of  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  cloak itself with more powers,  then  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore can become cynical about the efforts\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  Government to combat  and  eradicate  this\r\n\r\ndisease, and this Bill may become counter-productive.   I\r\n\r\nwish that this Bill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncould confine itself only to provisions to fight SARS and\r\n\r\nfuture  SARS-like  diseases,  and  not  to  empower   the\r\n\r\nGovernment with more powers than necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, I agree that this Bill is necessary.\r\n\r\nBut,  at  the  same  time,  the  Government  should  also\r\n\r\napproach  with a softer hand to get the full  cooperation\r\n\r\nof  the  people.  I am referring to education.  I believe\r\n\r\nthat  many  Singaporeans, especially  the  less  educated\r\n\r\nones,  do  not really understand what SARS is all  about.\r\n\r\nThey do not apprehend the seriousness of SARS and what it\r\n\r\ncan do, not only to Singaporeans, but also to the economy\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.   I think more can be done  to  teach  the\r\n\r\npeople  at  the grassroots level about SARS and,  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time, the Government should also take care  not  to\r\n\r\nover-react.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, do not send the special ambulance to\r\n\r\nevery  call for an ambulance service.  Only last week,  I\r\n\r\nwas  told that in two cases, the special ambulances, with\r\n\r\ntheir  attendants all covered up like spacemen,  went  to\r\n\r\npick up a resident with suspected heart attack and a  boy\r\n\r\nwith  only  a  cut  arm  at my constituency.   The  other\r\n\r\nresidents  there panicked and thought that  residents  in\r\n\r\nthat  block have been infected with SARS and they quickly\r\n\r\ntelephoned and insisted that the Town Council go and wash\r\n\r\nthe whole block again, which we did.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard that persons who died of SARS in\r\n\r\nhospitals  have their corpses wrapped, not in two  layers\r\n\r\nbut,  as  reported  in the press, with  three  layers  of\r\n\r\nplastic,  so much so that their relatives and next-of-kin\r\n\r\ncannot  even see the faces of their deceased  loved  ones\r\n\r\nbefore  their  bodies  were  cremated.   I  am  uncertain\r\n\r\nwhether the hospitals can do something to allow the faces\r\n\r\nof  the dead persons to be seen by their relatives before\r\n\r\nthey  are  sent for cremation.  I hope that the  Minister\r\n\r\nwill  ameliorate the situation to allow relatives  to  be\r\n\r\nable  to  see  their deceased patients  before  they  are\r\n\r\ncremated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards social responsibilities, I would urge all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to help their neighbours or anyone who needs\r\n\r\nhelp.  I am referring to the better educated Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto help and teach those Singaporeans, especially those in\r\n\r\nthe lower grassroots level, who are less educated and  do\r\n\r\nnot  really  apprehend what SARS is all about.   I  think\r\n\r\nsome of them may not even know the meaning or purpose  of\r\n\r\nquarantine.   They may think that they are not  sick  and\r\n\r\nask  why  should they be quarantined.  Or they  may  even\r\n\r\nthink that quarantine is a form of punishment imposed  on\r\n\r\nthem  by  the Government like a house arrest, and  not  a\r\n\r\npreventive health measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Michael Lim when he says that\r\n\r\nquarantine may not be effective and that persons who  are\r\n\r\nsuspected  of  SARS  should be  sent  to  a  neighbouring\r\n\r\nisland.   I think that is a better solution because  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are living in very dense  areas  in  public\r\n\r\nhousing  and even the present home quarantine  can  still\r\n\r\ncause a spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this time of crisis, all Singaporeans must\r\n\r\nplay  their part to help each other, as DPM Lee has  said\r\n\r\nyesterday. The Government, on its own, cannot  solve  the\r\n\r\nSARS problem.  It must have the help of all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSir,  this disease threatens the very livelihood  of  our\r\n\r\nnation and it is also a threat to our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the people of Singapore that\r\n\r\nmy  Party, the Singapore People's Party - although it  is\r\n\r\nan   Opposition  party  -  shall  close  ranks  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and all healthcare workers and the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  do our best to support all  measures  to\r\n\r\nprevent  the spread of this deadly disease, and  to  help\r\n\r\neradicate it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, allow me\r\n\r\nagain  to  salute our healthcare workers and the  medical\r\n\r\nfraternity  for  their selfless deeds  of  sacrifice  and\r\n\r\ncourage.  I think my heart, as well as the hearts of many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, surely go out to them each time  we  see  a\r\n\r\ndeath reported in the newspapers, particularly\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nif  it is that of a healthcare worker.  I would also like\r\n\r\nto  acknowledge the cooperation of all those who have not\r\n\r\nbroken  their quarantine orders.  And indeed, as we  have\r\n\r\nread from the press, these are actually the majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole SARS episode, Sir, is perhaps our\r\n\r\nequivalent of September 11th that galvanised the American\r\n\r\nnation  and  called  for an unprecedented  outpouring  of\r\n\r\ncivic responsibility and inspiration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment to the Act, though the\r\n\r\nmeasures would appear harsh and even draconian.   But  we\r\n\r\ncannot  allow the reckless acts of a minority to put  the\r\n\r\nlives  of the majority at risk. We cannot afford to  wait\r\n\r\nfor  this minority who appears to need time to understand\r\n\r\nthe  severity  of the situation and to be convinced  that\r\n\r\nthey  are endangering the lives of many others when  they\r\n\r\nbreak the quarantine orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberals could argue that the amendment would\r\n\r\nseverely  curtail civil liberties, privacy of information\r\n\r\nand  invest  the public health authorities  with  immense\r\n\r\npowers  that seem to have no check in place for potential\r\n\r\nabuse. However, we are facing a grave threat, perhaps  in\r\n\r\nsome  ways, more deadly than explosive acts of  terrorism\r\n\r\nbecause  the enemy is invisible to the naked eye.   Tough\r\n\r\nchallenges  call for tough measures, but I would  further\r\n\r\ncall upon all Singaporeans, while rightfully indignant at\r\n\r\nthose who break quarantine rules, to spare a thought  for\r\n\r\nthe circumstances under which this could happen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that not all HQO breakers are wilful.\r\n\r\nSome  people  may have broken quarantine  orders  due  to\r\n\r\nsheer  ignorance or a lack of understanding of the  risks\r\n\r\nof  infecting others.  They could also have done  so,  as\r\n\r\nmaking  a  living  may be their primary  concern.   I  am\r\n\r\ntherefore  very  pleased that the DPM has announced  that\r\n\r\nfinancial   assistance  will  be  offered   to   affected\r\n\r\nfamilies.  But these people also need to be assured  that\r\n\r\nthe Government has put in place measures to help minimise\r\n\r\ntheir   inconvenience  during  their  quarantine  period.\r\n\r\nThus, help must not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nonly be rendered to bring them some financial relief, but\r\n\r\nalso  to  meet their physiological needs, such  as  their\r\n\r\ndaily  meals, groceries, etc, for example, if the  entire\r\n\r\nfamily  is  quarantined, and they are unable  to  marshal\r\n\r\nhelp from their relatives and friends.  We must therefore\r\n\r\ntry  to  find out why these people have broken quarantine\r\n\r\norders or acted irresponsibly.  We can then devise better\r\n\r\neducation   and  communication  methods  to   help   them\r\n\r\nunderstand   the  gravity  of  the  situation   and   the\r\n\r\nprecautionary  measures  and responsible  behaviour  they\r\n\r\nought  to  take  so as to minimise their  urge  to  break\r\n\r\nquarantine orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, as the Bill is draconian, imposing\r\n\r\nstiff fines and penalties, including jail terms for  home\r\n\r\nquarantine offenders as well as other offenders, I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  urge the Minister to ensure that  a  system  of\r\n\r\ncheck  and  balance  is  in place.   There  should  be  a\r\n\r\nprotocol  for  officers enforcing this Act to  follow  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  Act  can  be  administered  appropriately  and\r\n\r\njustly.   Enforcers of the HQOs must clearly explain  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the HQOs and the consequences of breaking\r\n\r\nthe  order  to  the affected individuals in the  language\r\n\r\nthey  understand.  Some HQO breakers may perhaps not even\r\n\r\nbe  aware of what the fuss is all about due to a lack  of\r\n\r\neducation  or personal or family circumstances,  such  as\r\n\r\nage.   Public health and CISCO officers who first  impose\r\n\r\nHQOs  should  be  reminded  to take  a  more  counselling\r\n\r\napproach  and  carefully explain  the  whole  process  to\r\n\r\naffected    families   and   make   whatever   reasonable\r\n\r\narrangements  are  necessary to reduce  the  tendency  to\r\n\r\nbreak quarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask the Minister for a\r\n\r\nclarification of the new section 21A of the Bill,  as  my\r\n\r\nparliamentary  colleague, Dr Lily Neo,  has  alluded  to.\r\n\r\nHow  would  the person as specified in section 21A(2)  be\r\n\r\ndefined?   Would  this person include  a  doctor  with  a\r\n\r\nsuspected  SARS  patient at his clinic,  and  either  the\r\n\r\npatient wanders off whilst waiting for an ambulance, like\r\n\r\nin  the  case  of  the family of eight,  or  the  patient\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  wear  a  mask?   Also,  what  happens  if  a\r\n\r\nsuspected SARS case\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrefuses  to  heed the advice of a person who is  a  care-giver?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SARS war is clearly one battle that the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  even when it mobilises every  ounce  of  its\r\n\r\nvast and powerful machinery, cannot tackle by itself, but\r\n\r\nneeds  the  cooperation of every Singaporean.   We  must,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  continue  to  impress  on  Singaporeans  that\r\n\r\neveryone  must  play his part and take responsibility  in\r\n\r\nthis  battle  in order to ensure that our nation  is  not\r\n\r\ncrippled.   Yes,  glimpses of what some people  call  the\r\n\r\n\"Ugly  Singaporean\"  have appeared.  Brave  and  selfless\r\n\r\nnurses  working in the frontline have been  shunned,  and\r\n\r\nthere  was even a vegetable panic-buying spree.  However,\r\n\r\nthese are initial reactions or what some people may  call\r\n\r\nover-reactions  to  the fear of the unknown.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthose who continue in this mode of thinking and behaviour\r\n\r\nremain the minority.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our understanding of this pathogen grows, that\r\n\r\nknowledge  will give us greater confidence and assurance.\r\n\r\nAmidst   the   gloom   of  possibly  higher   fatalities,\r\n\r\nincreasing unemployment, rising temperatures, both on our\r\n\r\nforeheads   and   under  our  collars,  falling   tourist\r\n\r\narrivals, empty taxis and airplanes, we should  not  lose\r\n\r\nheart.  I therefore urge all Singaporeans to close ranks,\r\n\r\nbear up with the tough measures we need to take and fight\r\n\r\nthis  SARS  war, including the amendment  that  has  been\r\n\r\nproposed in this Bill, and to overcome our fear together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I call upon Mr Khaw Boon Wan to address\r\n\r\nthe House via video.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Khaw Boon Wan (Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, for making this facility so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can all join in the debate without causing  any\r\n\r\nanxiety to our colleagues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this week, I had to visit Tan Tock Seng\r\n\r\nHospital,  Intensive Care Unit, where SARS patients  were\r\n\r\nbeing cared for.  I was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproperly  protected - N95 mask, gown and gloves.   I  did\r\n\r\nnot  have to get near any patient.  There was no risk  of\r\n\r\nmy  being  exposed and infected.  But,  purely  to  allay\r\n\r\nanxiety,  I  decided to suspend all my activities  in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,   including   my   weekly   meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession.  The risk of my becoming infected and, in  turn,\r\n\r\npassing  it  on  to the residents in my  constituency  is\r\n\r\npractically nil, but I would rather not cause any anxiety\r\n\r\non  their  part.  For the same reason, I decided  that  I\r\n\r\nshould  stay away from Parliament during this period.   I\r\n\r\nwill  resume community activities from 1st  of  May.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  my first public function will be the NTUC May  Day\r\n\r\nRally, even as I continue to visit the hospitals.  But  I\r\n\r\nwill  no longer need to go inside hotspots like Intensive\r\n\r\nCare Units.  By the way, I continue to go home every  day\r\n\r\nto  play my role as a father and husband.  I take comfort\r\n\r\nin  the  fact that no Tan Tock Seng Hospital  worker  has\r\n\r\nbeen  infected for some time now, ever since  we  got  to\r\n\r\nknow  this  virus better, and instituted  full  infection\r\n\r\ncontrol and protection for staff and visitors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this virus is dangerous, but actually\r\n\r\nnot  that  scary.  You can get infected only if  you  are\r\n\r\nnear a SARS patient and unprotected.  In Singapore, where\r\n\r\nwe  have so far managed to control its spread, the  high-risk  areas  are mainly hospitals and the homes  of  SARS\r\n\r\npatients.   Outside of these areas, the risk  of  getting\r\n\r\ninfected  is  insignificant, although not zero.   We  are\r\n\r\nworking hard to maintain this state of affairs, while  we\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  enhance infection control in the  hospitals\r\n\r\nand   achieve  effective  protection  for  our   hospital\r\n\r\nworkers, patients and visitors.  This is the top priority\r\n\r\nof  our SARS combat unit.  It is to eliminate in-hospital\r\n\r\ninfection.   If we do our job well, we will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nreduce the risk of hospital workers, patients or visitors\r\n\r\nbecoming  infected  while they are in  hospitals  to  the\r\n\r\nabsolute  minimum.   And, with some luck,  perhaps,  even\r\n\r\nzero in some hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? We are focusing our efforts in five areas.\r\n\r\nFirst,  equip our hospital workers, patients and visitors\r\n\r\nwith  proper  protective gear, that means  masks,  3Gs  - gowns, goggles and gloves, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprotective  suits when doing procedures on patients  like\r\n\r\nintubation   or  surgery.   An  unprotected   or   poorly\r\n\r\nprotected  worker handling a SARS patient is  fighting  a\r\n\r\nformidable enemy without weapon or shield.  A few earlier\r\n\r\ncases  of  hospital workers being infected  were  due  to\r\n\r\ninadequate protection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, train our hospital workers on infection\r\n\r\ncontrol  and proper use of protective gear, eg,  an  ill-fitted N95 mask that is not 100% sealed is no protection.\r\n\r\nTraining and retraining now go on repeatedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, ensure full compliance. A good infection\r\n\r\ncontrol  plan is only good if it is put into practice  by\r\n\r\nall staff at all times.  This calls for repeat reminders,\r\n\r\nfrequent audits and peer pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, pick up early onset of symptoms. Without a\r\n\r\nreliable  diagnostic  kit, the  next  best  thing  is  to\r\n\r\nmeasure  temperature at frequent intervals.  As  soon  as\r\n\r\nfever  is detected in staff, patient or visitor, an alarm\r\n\r\ngoes off and we spring into action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, isolate immediately all those with SARS\r\n\r\nsymptoms, with full protection and barrier nursing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together, these five components make up what I call\r\n\r\nthe  PDI strategy - Protect, Detect and Isolate.  We  are\r\n\r\nnow putting it into practice in all our hospitals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the virus now out of the bottle and in the\r\n\r\ninternational  community, it is  no  longer  possible  to\r\n\r\neradicate it soon.  Hospitals will now have to live  with\r\n\r\nSARS.   Procedures  and processes will  have  to  be  re-engineered   to  cope  with  this  changed   environment.\r\n\r\nInfection  control  will have to  be  taken  a  lot  more\r\n\r\nseriously  than in the good old pre-SARS days.   What  it\r\n\r\nalso  implies is that, going forward, we cannot hope  for\r\n\r\nno  more  new cases of infection.  Instead,  it  is  more\r\n\r\nlikely  that we will have occasional cases of  infection.\r\n\r\nHopefully, we will be able to quickly detect and  isolate\r\n\r\nthem before they do extensive damage, but this is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsomething  for  the  future.  Meanwhile,  I  am  mentally\r\n\r\nprepared for the situation to get worse, before  it  gets\r\n\r\nbetter.   This  is because we do not yet fully  know  the\r\n\r\nenemy.   How is it transmitted?  How long does it survive\r\n\r\noutside  the  human  body?   It  is  tough  fighting   an\r\n\r\ninvisible enemy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early days of the outbreak, many of our\r\n\r\nhospital  workers were infected.  This  is  because,  for\r\n\r\nmany  decades now, modern hospitals do not have  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  serious infectious diseases.  As a result, we  have\r\n\r\nrelaxed  on  infection  control  standards,  as  it   was\r\n\r\nunnecessary,  and it would have been an  over-kill.   But\r\n\r\nafter  we  have  understood the  enemy  better,  and  put\r\n\r\nourselves  on high alert, in protective gear, the  number\r\n\r\nof  hospital  workers becoming casualties has  come  down\r\n\r\ndrastically.   We  are now busily strengthening  all  the\r\n\r\nhospitals, getting them up to shape.  This will take some\r\n\r\ntime  as  old habits do take time to change, but  we  are\r\n\r\nlearning quickly day by day and getting into full swing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new complication for us is that some patients with\r\n\r\nother  illnesses  have been infected.  Because  of  their\r\n\r\nother  illnesses,  the SARS symptoms  are  often  masked.\r\n\r\nThis  has made early detection very difficult.   That  is\r\n\r\nwhy  we  may still have the occasional break-out  in  our\r\n\r\nhospitals,  despite  the best of efforts.   There  is  no\r\n\r\nshortcut to this problem, except to keep vigilant and  to\r\n\r\nclose  in  on the enemy as soon as its identity has  been\r\n\r\nexposed.   That  is why we await so eagerly  for  a  good\r\n\r\nreliable  diagnostic  kit.  Without  it,  we  are  really\r\n\r\nfighting with a major handicap.  Meanwhile, we should all\r\n\r\nbe  mentally  prepared for new cases and  some  setbacks.\r\n\r\nBut  we  should  not allow such occasional  eruptions  to\r\n\r\nreduce  us to frenzy and mass panic.  To win this  fight,\r\n\r\nwe  need cooperation from all Singaporeans.  To stop  the\r\n\r\nspread  in  the community, we need cooperation  from  the\r\n\r\nentire  community,  not 80-90% but 100%  of  cooperation.\r\n\r\nJust  a few super-spreaders who are irresponsible and  we\r\n\r\nwill have a major setback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans are not helpless in this fight. We\r\n\r\nshould certainly not be mere\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrightened, passive spectators of this battle.   We  have\r\n\r\nmuch  to do, and if we do it well, we can win this battle\r\n\r\ntogether, and decisively.  What can you do?  I suggest we\r\n\r\nfocus on three areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, raise our personal and public hygiene to the\r\n\r\nJapanese   standard.   SARS  appears  to  be  spread   by\r\n\r\ndroplets.   So  regular wiping and cleaning  would  help.\r\n\r\nEveryone  should stop irresponsible people from  spitting\r\n\r\nin  public, sneezing or coughing, without covering  their\r\n\r\nface,  or littering.  Frown on them, stare at them,  make\r\n\r\nsure  they get the message.  I cannot help noticing  that\r\n\r\nJapan,  despite  very intensive business  and  people-to-people   contact  with  China  and  Hong  Kong,   remains\r\n\r\nunaffected  by  SARS.   I do not think  they  are  merely\r\n\r\nlucky.   I  think years of keeping high personal  hygiene\r\n\r\nmust  have contributed to this state of affairs.  So  let\r\n\r\nus  clean up our act in hospitals, homes, offices, hawker\r\n\r\ncentres and everywhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, support our hospital workers. They are\r\n\r\nworking flat out for weeks now.  As I walked the hospital\r\n\r\nfloor,  I can see fatigue in their faces.  Many  are  now\r\n\r\ndoing extended shifts - double shifts.  I worry that some\r\n\r\nmay  break down.  They need all the support and help that\r\n\r\nwe  can give.  Many Singaporeans are indeed doing so.   I\r\n\r\nsee  Milos,  Ovaltines, essence of chickens,  vitamin  Cs\r\n\r\nbeing sent regularly to the wards, together with flowers,\r\n\r\nlovely  poems  and  paintings - absolutely  heartwarming.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, if they are able to keep their body and  soul\r\n\r\ntogether,  despite  having to  live  with  the  risk  and\r\n\r\npunishing  work  pace, it is due to this wonderful  moral\r\n\r\nsupport  that  they are getting from fellow Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  a  small number of  Singaporeans  remains\r\n\r\ndetermined to make our lives difficult.  Some  lie  about\r\n\r\ntheir history, and some break home quarantine.  This Bill\r\n\r\nwill   directly   address  these   deliberate   acts   of\r\n\r\ndishonesty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are also some Singaporeans who make\r\n\r\nour  lives more difficult, perhaps without realising  it.\r\n\r\nThese are the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvisitors of patients to the hospitals, A&E Department and\r\n\r\nwards.  Our staff are already busy, protecting themselves\r\n\r\nand their patients, besides rendering medical care.  With\r\n\r\nvisitors,  they have the added responsibility  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntheir  safety.   This is not theoretical.   There  was  a\r\n\r\nvisitor  who accompanied her husband to an A&E Department\r\n\r\nfor  treatment.   The husband was in a  trolley,  closely\r\n\r\nmonitored.   His trolley was next to another patient  who\r\n\r\nwas also in a trolley, who subsequently turned out to  be\r\n\r\na SARS patient, although unknown at that time.  But there\r\n\r\nwas  proper  separation procedure and infection  control.\r\n\r\nThe  husband  never became infected.  However,  the  lady\r\n\r\nvisitor,  despite constant advice and pleas  by  our  A&E\r\n\r\nstaff, insisted on hanging around in the observation ward\r\n\r\nfor  a  good five hours, moving from trolley to  trolley.\r\n\r\nShe became infected by the SARS patient and is now in Tan\r\n\r\nTock Seng Hospital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have cut down visits to hospitals to one visitor\r\n\r\nper  patient  but, really, the hospitals  would  strongly\r\n\r\nprefer a \"No Visitor\" rule during this period, except for\r\n\r\ncompassionate cases, like for children, and seriously ill\r\n\r\npatients.   Toronto Hospital has already imposed  such  a\r\n\r\nrule.  This will help minimise risk of inadvertent spread\r\n\r\nthrough  hospital visitors, besides reducing the load  on\r\n\r\nthe hospital workers.  On the ground, we will be flexible\r\n\r\nto address the emotional needs of some patients and their\r\n\r\nloved  ones.  We hope Singaporeans will support this  no-visitor rule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, think out creative, practical ideas to help\r\n\r\nfight  SARS.   For  example, I was most pleased  to  read\r\n\r\nabout  the taxi driver who prints his namecard and  gives\r\n\r\none  to  each passenger with a receipt.  In this way,  in\r\n\r\nthe  event that contact tracing has to be done, with  him\r\n\r\nas  a  SARS  suspect, his passengers will more likely  be\r\n\r\nable  to  recall.  Likewise, someone suggested  that  all\r\n\r\ncounter  staff  in  the  shops, banks,  supermarkets  and\r\n\r\nhawker  stalls place a bowl in which all their  customers\r\n\r\ncan throw in their namecards.  Every day, the collections\r\n\r\ncan  be  bagged  and  dated.  In the event  that  contact\r\n\r\ntracing has to be done involving this particular outlet,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  process can then be speeded up.  To make it fun,  we\r\n\r\ncan  have a monthly lucky draw of these namecards  before\r\n\r\nthey  are  discarded with prizes for the  lucky  winners.\r\n\r\nThere  are  so  many ways in which Singaporeans  can  get\r\n\r\ninvolved in fighting this battle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fun part is not to trivialise the matter, but to\r\n\r\nhelp raise public awareness.  For example, there can be a\r\n\r\nsong  or jingle competition on how to remind Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  take temperature twice a day, wash hands every  other\r\n\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this is a major crisis. We cannot duck\r\n\r\nit.   But  we should turn it into an opportunity to  bond\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and to strengthen our spirit as one  people.\r\n\r\nA few of our hospital workers have sacrificed their lives\r\n\r\nin  this battle.  A few are fighting for their lives.   I\r\n\r\nsaw  them in the Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Intensive  Care\r\n\r\nUnit.  Many more are quietly but courageously fighting in\r\n\r\nthe trenches, not knowing which patient will turn out  to\r\n\r\nbe SARS.  As I walk the ground, talk to them, I know I am\r\n\r\ntalking  to  true heroes and heroines.  They are  risking\r\n\r\ntheir lives every day, every hour, so that we can all  be\r\n\r\nsafe.  The minimum we can do is not to hamper their  work\r\n\r\nbut to help them get on with their job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now many times better prepared than when we\r\n\r\nstarted  43 days ago.  We know the enemy better, although\r\n\r\nstill not fully.  We are better equipped, better trained,\r\n\r\nbetter  protected.   Preliminary  diagnostic  kits   have\r\n\r\narrived,  and we are perfecting them.  So,  even  if  the\r\n\r\nnext  few  days may turn out to be worse than  today,  we\r\n\r\nknow  that  we  will  win the battle sooner  rather  than\r\n\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, I join my colleagues in the support of the amendment\r\n\r\nBill.   Indeed, I am so glad to hear the call of  support\r\n\r\nfrom my parliamentary colleagues, as mentioned earlier on\r\n\r\nby  Senior  Minister  of State, Mr  Khaw  Boon  Wan,  for\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am myself a healthcare provider. I work in a\r\n\r\nhospital  which is together with a restructured  hospital\r\n\r\nin  the  fight against SARS.  Every minute  of  the  day,\r\n\r\nthere  are  only two things in the minds of my staff  and\r\n\r\nmyself  -  SARS and infection control  -  and I can  tell\r\n\r\nyou,   honestly,  even  in  our  dreams.   The  frontline\r\n\r\nhealthcare providers  -  doctors, nurses, social workers,\r\n\r\ntherapists,  pharmacists,  hospital  cleaners,  ambulance\r\n\r\ndrivers  -  are all human.  We too share in the  fear  of\r\n\r\ngetting  infected with SARS and I can tell you the  worst\r\n\r\nfear is putting our family members and our loved ones  at\r\n\r\nrisk too.  Despite the fear, the risk, the sacrifice,  we\r\n\r\nall  know that we have a job to do, and we must make sure\r\n\r\nthat  we  do  our  jobs right regardless of  whether  our\r\n\r\npatients have SARS or not, regardless of knowing the fact\r\n\r\nthat  we are putting ourselves and our loved ones at  our\r\n\r\nhomes at risk by doing our job.  We know that we have  to\r\n\r\ndo  our  jobs right.  If not, our family and our  country\r\n\r\nwill be in trouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister had earlier highlighted two\r\n\r\nexamples  of  black sheep within the community.   I  have\r\n\r\nseen  for  myself unreasonable visitors  to  my  hospital\r\n\r\nverbally  abusing my nurses when my nurses tell  them  to\r\n\r\nfollow  Ministry of Health's guidelines  to  restrict  to\r\n\r\njust two visitors per day.  If I could speak on behalf of\r\n\r\nall  the  healthcare workers in Singapore, I will support\r\n\r\nthe  amendment Bill wholeheartedly.  We have  to  contain\r\n\r\nthe  infection.   We cannot let the efforts and sacrifice\r\n\r\nof  our  fellow  healthcare providers go to  waste,  just\r\n\r\nbecause of social irresponsibility of a few black sheep.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also try to touch on three points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) On the topic of quarantine, some people who\r\n\r\nhave  been served with Quarantine Orders question whether\r\n\r\nthis is necessary.  They feel that their freedom is being\r\n\r\ntaken  away.   But in the face of SARS, let me  say  that\r\n\r\nQuarantine Orders are definitely necessary.  As a medical\r\n\r\ndoctor,  in the control of any infectious disease,  there\r\n\r\nare  only  two  main  approaches, and  they  have  to  be\r\n\r\nconcurrently implemented. One, is in the control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof the spread of the infection, by way of identification,\r\n\r\nisolation  and quarantine.  The other is in the treatment\r\n\r\nof  those infected by the infection itself.  In the  case\r\n\r\nof  SARS,  when  the  diagnostic kit and  the  definitive\r\n\r\ntreatment of the disease are not discovered yet, the only\r\n\r\nway  to be on top of the situation is through the control\r\n\r\nof  the spread of the infection.  The amendment Bill  has\r\n\r\nthus  empowered the Ministry to achieve the objective  of\r\n\r\ncontrolling the spread of the infection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) We all know that Singapore is a small country.\r\n\r\nMany  of us live in built-up areas.  We intermingle  with\r\n\r\none    another    at   our   neighbourhood   coffeeshops,\r\n\r\nmarketplaces  and  workplaces.   Thus,  with  this  close\r\n\r\nproximity of us being with one another, in the face of an\r\n\r\ninfection  like  SARS, if our preventive  and  quarantine\r\n\r\nmeasures  are not in place and even if they are in  place\r\n\r\nbut not enforced, and people being non-compliant to them,\r\n\r\nthen we would end up in a very sorrowful state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is one other thing which is as important,\r\n\r\nif not more important, than the enforcement of quarantine\r\n\r\nand preventive measures in the face of SARS, and that  is\r\n\r\ndefinitely none other than public education.  I  am  sure\r\n\r\nthe  House  would  agree  with  me  that,  to  date,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  done very well on  this.   PM,  DPM  and\r\n\r\nMinister  Lim Hng Kiang have, time and time  again,  been\r\n\r\nemphasising  about social responsibilities,  and  we  all\r\n\r\nknow  that  there  are always some  black  sheep  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  who  are socially irresponsible  and  selfish.\r\n\r\nThus, in addition to the continuation of public education\r\n\r\nand  the  call  for social responsibility, the  amendment\r\n\r\nBill   would  be  necessary  and  definitely  timely   to\r\n\r\nsafeguard   the   interests   of   socially   responsible\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  definitely the general  population  at\r\n\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end by saying this. Laws are necessary\r\n\r\nbecause of seeming disregard for public health, just like\r\n\r\nsmoking,  drunk driving, etc.  And in a situation  of  an\r\n\r\ninfectious disease like SARS, the effects carry\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neven  more  profound and severe consequences.   Laws  are\r\n\r\nthere to support and allow public health officials to act\r\n\r\nsafely, to act as deterrent, to guide human behaviour and\r\n\r\nto  spell out the gravity of the situation to the few who\r\n\r\ncould not care less.  Nevertheless, the public must still\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be educated.  Ignorance and fear  would  be\r\n\r\nmore  deadly  than  SARS  itself.   Ignorance  would   be\r\n\r\novercome by public education.  Fear would be minimised by\r\n\r\nthe  effort  of  the Ministry of Health,  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nworkers  and  the  Ministerial  Committee's  effort  and,\r\n\r\ndefinitely,  by the amendment Bill.  Thus, I support  the\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, in the  spring of a certain year in  China,\r\n\r\nthere  was  an  epidemic plague.   The  epidemic  was  so\r\n\r\ncontagious that it spread very quickly and the  mortality\r\n\r\nrate was very high.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China was trading with many countries at that time.\r\n\r\nVery quickly, this epidemic plague was spread to all over\r\n\r\nAsia  and Europe.  Through the merchant ships, it  spread\r\n\r\nto  Sicily  in  Italy  and, in a  few  days'  time,  this\r\n\r\nepidemic plague had struck both the urban and rural areas\r\n\r\nof Sicily.  It was said that an affected person had lunch\r\n\r\nwith  his  friends.  Yet, in the evening, he  joined  his\r\n\r\nancestors in heaven for dinner!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This epidemic ravaged Europe and killed one-third of\r\n\r\nits population in a short span of five years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, fortunately, I am not talking about\r\n\r\nthe  SARS  situation  today.   I  am  talking  about  the\r\n\r\npandemic  plague also known as \"black death\" in the  14th\r\n\r\ncentury.  Seven hundred years later, fortunately, now our\r\n\r\nmedical   science  is  more  advanced.  We  have   better\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  better  means  to  counter  the   various\r\n\r\ndiseases  and  the  mortality rate  of  SARS  is  not  as\r\n\r\nterrible as that of the \"black death\".  However, with our\r\n\r\ntransport facilities being much more advanced now  -   we\r\n\r\nno  longer travel by horse carriage or steamships  -  our\r\n\r\npeople   are   travelling  much  more   extensively   and\r\n\r\nfrequently. In the process,  diseases also\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspread  much  faster  and wider.   In  densely  populated\r\n\r\ncities  like Singapore, if we lower our guard,  the  SARS\r\n\r\nepidemic   would  spread  to  the  community,   and   the\r\n\r\nconsequences can be very serious.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for this reason, when we are\r\n\r\nfencing  SARS, we should not have soft knees.  We  should\r\n\r\nnot  avail any opening to the SARS virus to spread beyond\r\n\r\nthe hospital ring-fence.  From the perspective of medical\r\n\r\nsciences and public health, we have to break the chain of\r\n\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we must identify the source of\r\n\r\ninfection and the contacts who may turn out to be suspect\r\n\r\nor  probable cases. The latter may be infected  with  the\r\n\r\nvirus,  and  could spread the infection in the incubation\r\n\r\nperiod.   Following that, we have to isolate the patients\r\n\r\nand the contacts from the healthy population.  Generally,\r\n\r\nthe  patients will be admitted to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nfor  treatment.  As for the contacts, because they do not\r\n\r\nshow  symptoms  of  the disease, they will  be  isolated,\r\n\r\neither at home or at other places of confinement,  so  as\r\n\r\nto minimise the possibility of infection to others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quarantine method is definitely effective in our\r\n\r\nfight  against  SARS.  In the last six weeks,  there  has\r\n\r\nbeen no new case of any medical officer or hospital staff\r\n\r\nbeing infected.  This shows that the isolation method  is\r\n\r\na  correct one.  However, in our community, when we  want\r\n\r\nto  ring-fence  this  disease, we  would  depend  on  the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of everyone, particularly those  people  who\r\n\r\nare served with Home Quarantine Orders (HQOs).  Only then\r\n\r\ncan this containment exercise be effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the implementation of the HQO scheme, the\r\n\r\nmajority  of  those served with the order have  complied.\r\n\r\nYet, there is a still a handful of people who have broken\r\n\r\nthe  order.  They continue to go to office or participate\r\n\r\nin community activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, such irresponsible action is like\r\n\r\nbreaking  a hole in our ring-fence and allowing the  SARS\r\n\r\nvirus to go\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nloose.   Once the SARS virus is spread to the  community,\r\n\r\nour  work  will be made so much more difficult.  Besides,\r\n\r\nthere  are  some infected persons who would not  want  to\r\n\r\ndisclose that they had a high temperature or symptom, for\r\n\r\nfear of being isolated.  Since the implementation of  the\r\n\r\nHQOs, we have been moderate in our enforcement. Now  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  see  some of these people not taking the  orders\r\n\r\nseriously and acting irresponsibly, we may just  have  to\r\n\r\ndeal with them more severely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I support this Amendment Bill so that the\r\n\r\nlaw  enforcers would have more muscles to deal  with  the\r\n\r\nviolators,  to fine or even imprison them.   This  severe\r\n\r\npunishment would serve a deterrent effect, so that  those\r\n\r\nwho  have been served with HQOs would not dare to violate\r\n\r\nthem.   With this Amendment Bill, we can further show  to\r\n\r\nthe  people all over the world our determination to fight\r\n\r\nagainst SARS and to enhance their confidence in us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although I do support using harsh\r\n\r\npunishment against offenders,  I hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  also work harder in public education and send  the\r\n\r\nproper  message to our people.  If we want our people  to\r\n\r\nact  in a responsible manner, I think we should give them\r\n\r\na  better  understanding of the matter.   In  a  dialogue\r\n\r\nsession yesterday, someone reflected that nowadays, there\r\n\r\nare  a  lot  of rumours being spread through e-mails  and\r\n\r\nSMS.   Some  would  say, \"Oh, this area was  closed  down\r\n\r\nbecause of SARS.  Or so-and-so was infected with SARS and\r\n\r\nhospitalised.\"  By spreading rumours it would only add to\r\n\r\nthe fears and chaos in our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, I urge the Government to send a\r\n\r\nvery  clear signal to the people so that everybody  would\r\n\r\nrather  depend  on  the  television  and  the  media  for\r\n\r\nofficial  updates  on  the SARS situation  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthereby dispelling all rumours on the emails and SMS.  We\r\n\r\nshould also deal with these rumour-mongers more severely.\r\n\r\nJust  like after the September 11 event, there were  some\r\n\r\npeople who were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nspreading rumours, and we took harsh action against them.\r\n\r\nI think we should do likewise this time round.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In public education, I think that we should make\r\n\r\ngreater  efforts  in propagating public health  knowledge\r\n\r\nand  information to our people.  For example, the  family\r\n\r\nof  eight  who was asked to wait for the ambulance  at  a\r\n\r\ndesignated spot outside the clinic, ignored the  doctor's\r\n\r\ninstructions  and  wandered around the vicinity,  causing\r\n\r\nthe whole area to be closed down and isolated.  There was\r\n\r\nanother vegetable wholesaler who had been running a  high\r\n\r\nfever  for  many days and yet refused to go to  Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital, but went all over the places to  see  his\r\n\r\nfamily  doctor  and  two Chinese  physicians.   This  may\r\n\r\nperhaps be due to their ignorance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, I also observe some irresponsible action of\r\n\r\nsome  people.  My hospital is just next to Tan Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.   My  colleagues told me that many  people  had\r\n\r\nbeen  throwing  away their used masks along  the  walkway\r\n\r\nbetween  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital  and  the  Novena  MRT\r\n\r\nstation.  We can see a lot of these discarded used  masks\r\n\r\nall  over the places.  I presume these masks were  thrown\r\n\r\naway  by  the  people  who  had  visited  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital.  This is certainly very bad for public  health.\r\n\r\nI  think  we should change our people's behaviour through\r\n\r\npublic  education.   Perhaps our Health  Promotion  Board\r\n\r\nshould  reach  out  to the community and  step  up  their\r\n\r\nefforts  in public education to our people.  At the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we should also look after the people who  are  not\r\n\r\nconversant  with English.  If possible, we may  even  use\r\n\r\ndialects  or  the  minority languages  to  educate  these\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the fight against SARS is the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  every  citizen  of   Singapore.    I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, support this Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I call upon Dr Balaji Sadasivan to\r\n\r\naddress the House via video.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Health and the Environment (Dr Balaji Sadasivan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in\r\n\r\nsupport of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SARS is a new disease. It hit us without warning.\r\n\r\nOn  March  12th,  when WHO issued its  warning,  we  were\r\n\r\nunsure what the disease pattern was going to be or how it\r\n\r\nwas transmitted or what the patient outcome was going  to\r\n\r\nbe.    Because  we  are dealing with the unknown,  it  is\r\n\r\nnatural  to be afraid.  In this battle against  SARS  and\r\n\r\nthe  fear  that SARS induces, information is  power.   It\r\n\r\nhelps  overcome our fear and puts problems in the correct\r\n\r\nperspective.  In the last six weeks, we have learnt  much\r\n\r\nabout  this  disease that allows us to better assess  the\r\n\r\ndanger  that SARS poses.  I want to highlight  three  key\r\n\r\npoints that Members of this House and Singaporeans should\r\n\r\ntake note of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is that most SARS patients recover.\r\n\r\nSARS  is a serious disease.  There is a mortality  of  5-10%.   But  this means that 90% do recover.  Of  the  192\r\n\r\npatients  diagnosed with SARS so far, 120 have  recovered\r\n\r\nand have been discharged from the hospital.  More will be\r\n\r\ndischarged  in  the coming days.  Since  SARS  is  a  new\r\n\r\ndisease, to get a perspective of how dangerous or serious\r\n\r\nit  is, let us compare SARS with other diseases.  SARS is\r\n\r\nnot like cancer.  In cancer, even with treatment, you may\r\n\r\nnot  always  have a cure.  Cancer treatment is  long  and\r\n\r\ndifficult  and you always have to worry about the  cancer\r\n\r\ncoming  back.   SARS is not like stroke,  where  you  may\r\n\r\nrecover  but  you may be left with a disability  for  the\r\n\r\nrest  of  your  life.  In SARS, 90% of patients  recover.\r\n\r\nThey return to work as per normal without any disability.\r\n\r\nAnd  because they have antibodies against SARS, they  are\r\n\r\nimmune from getting SARS again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, there are three\r\n\r\ndoctors who have caught SARS.  They have been treated and\r\n\r\nhave  returned to work at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to  look\r\n\r\nafter other SARS patients.  Two more doctors who are  now\r\n\r\nat home will return to work next week and join them.  Our\r\n\r\nresearch teams testing the diagnostic kits\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed specimens of mucus from the back of the throat.  You\r\n\r\nneed to be well protected to take a swab from the back of\r\n\r\nthe  throat of a SARS patient because when you tickle the\r\n\r\nback  of the throat of a patient, he may cough into  your\r\n\r\nface  spraying you with a lot of SARS virus.  These  SARS\r\n\r\nrecovered doctors can safely obtain the specimens because\r\n\r\nthey  are  immune  to the disease and cannot  catch  SARS\r\n\r\nagain.   They  are  helping  our  research  teams  obtain\r\n\r\nspecimens from SARS patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients who have recovered from SARS are not only\r\n\r\nreturning to work, they are also helping other  new  SARS\r\n\r\npatients  fight the virus.  When you recover  from  SARS,\r\n\r\nyou have plenty of antibodies in your blood that can help\r\n\r\nkill   the  SARS  virus.   These  patients  donate  their\r\n\r\nantibodies  to new patients to help them fight  the  SARS\r\n\r\nvirus.   This  is  called  serum  therapy  and  new  SARS\r\n\r\npatients  at  Tan Tock Seng Hospital are benefiting  from\r\n\r\nthis treatment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best place in the world to get treatment for\r\n\r\nSARS  is  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital.  They  have  the  most\r\n\r\nknowledge and experience in dealing with the disease  and\r\n\r\nwe have given them all the resources they need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, at my meet-the-people session, a young\r\n\r\nman, a technician, saw me for help.  He had lost his job.\r\n\r\nHe wanted his employer to reinstate him.  I asked him why\r\n\r\nhe  lost  his  job.   He said he went to  a  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry  for  a week without applying for leave  and  his\r\n\r\ncompany terminated his services.  I asked him why he  did\r\n\r\nthat.  He replied he was scared of SARS and so he went to\r\n\r\na small town to hide.  I looked at him.  He was young and\r\n\r\nathletic  and I asked him why he was afraid of SARS.   He\r\n\r\nsaid  he  had  a cough.  I told him lots of  people  have\r\n\r\ncoughs.   He  then told me he went to Hong Kong  in  mid-February to participate in a sporting event and so he was\r\n\r\nafraid  that  he had SARS.  So I asked the young  man  to\r\n\r\nreview his actions.  If he did not have SARS, he has lost\r\n\r\nhis  job because of his fear.  But if he had SARS,  would\r\n\r\nhe be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbetter  off  in  a small town with no or  little  medical\r\n\r\nexpertise or at Tan Tock Seng Hospital where the care  is\r\n\r\nequal  to  the best in the world?  The young man  had  no\r\n\r\nanswer.   He realised he had allowed fear to take control\r\n\r\nof  him.   The  fear of SARS is more dangerous  than  the\r\n\r\ndisease SARS itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I want to highlight is that SARS is\r\n\r\ncontrollable.  In looking at our cases, we find that  our\r\n\r\nSARS cases caught their infection by having close contact\r\n\r\nwith  a person who was feeling unwell from SARS.   If  we\r\n\r\ncan   isolate   SARS   patients  early,   we   can   stop\r\n\r\ntransmission.  We need the help of all Singaporeans to do\r\n\r\nthis.    Singaporeans   are,  in  general,   a   socially\r\n\r\nresponsible people and are united in this battle.  But we\r\n\r\nneed  the  cooperation of every single Singaporean.   One\r\n\r\nweak link and the virus will use that link to pass on  to\r\n\r\nthe next person.  A single person with SARS, if he is the\r\n\r\nweak  link in our defence and does not behave responsibly\r\n\r\nand if he is infectious, he can pass on the infection  to\r\n\r\nas  many  as  20 persons.  Hence, the need to  amend  the\r\n\r\nInfectious  Diseases Act to get the few who  may  not  be\r\n\r\nresponsible to join us in this fight against SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point I would like to highlight is that we\r\n\r\nare at a critical point in our battle against SARS.  This\r\n\r\nweek,  WHO  downgraded Toronto's status to that  of  Hong\r\n\r\nKong,  Guangdong  and  Beijing,  that  is,  a  place  for\r\n\r\ntravellers to avoid.  We are at the brink.  If we fail to\r\n\r\ncontain  the  outbreak, we may end  up  joining  Toronto,\r\n\r\nBeijing  and  Hong Kong as places that travellers  should\r\n\r\navoid.  This will cost us many jobs.  However, if we work\r\n\r\ntogether,  we can move away from this brink  and  contain\r\n\r\nthe  outbreak.  Hence the need for urgency and resolution\r\n\r\nin our actions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This reflects  how\r\n\r\nswift the spread of SARS has been that makes it necessary\r\n\r\nfor us to make further provisions in the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we amended the Act on 21st March, there were\r\n\r\nthen  37  cases  of  SARS and no death  as  yet.   As  of\r\n\r\nyesterday, we had 192 cases, including 17 who have  since\r\n\r\ndied plus two other deaths which have yet to be confirmed\r\n\r\nas  SARS  cases.  And now, about 2,500 people  are  under\r\n\r\nHome Quarantine Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the House is being asked to amend the Act\r\n\r\nagain,  this  time notably to increase the penalties  for\r\n\r\nthose who break their Home Quarantine Orders.  Sir, these\r\n\r\nare steps that I fully support.  That there are those who\r\n\r\nhave  broken their HQOs so blatantly and thereby  putting\r\n\r\nothers  at risk or being affected with SARS have  aroused\r\n\r\nthe anger of many Singaporeans.  In my opinion, there are\r\n\r\nno  two ways to deal with those who flout their HQOs.  If\r\n\r\nsomeone  puts the rest of society at risk and in  danger,\r\n\r\nthen  we  have to ensure that the full force of  the  law\r\n\r\ncomes  down  hard.    We are now at war with  the  deadly\r\n\r\ndisease and this calls for strict and draconian measures,\r\n\r\nI  may say.  And for some, it must mean a loss of freedom\r\n\r\nas  they submit to the well-being of the country ahead of\r\n\r\ntheir own personal needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the two cases highlighted by the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nin  his open letter - one of the family of eight who went\r\n\r\nwandering away from the doctor's clinic while waiting for\r\n\r\nan  ambulance to take them to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  and\r\n\r\nthe other of a sick man from the Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWholesale  Centre  who  went doctor-  and  sinseh-hopping\r\n\r\nbefore  landing up in TTSH - reflect the dilemma  we  are\r\n\r\nall in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of the family of eight, they were\r\n\r\nasked  to  wait outside the doctor's clinic  and,  as  we\r\n\r\nunderstand  from subsequent reports, they had  just  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  the funeral service of a member of their  family\r\n\r\nwho  died the previous day and, in all probability,  they\r\n\r\nwere  tired, they were hungry and they went round looking\r\n\r\nfor food.  And I believe that if the ambulance had come a\r\n\r\nbit  earlier, they would probably not have gone away from\r\n\r\nwhere they were waiting.  As we were told a call for  the\r\n\r\nambulance  was  made at 10.30 am, but the ambulance  only\r\n\r\narrived at 12.30 pm, and this begs the question of why it\r\n\r\ntook so long for the ambulance to turn up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that they have acted irresponsibly.\r\n\r\nBut,  on the other hand, there are also people like those\r\n\r\nwho   continue  to  be  in  denial  mode  or   who   fear\r\n\r\nstigmatisation by the rest of the society - the  fear  of\r\n\r\nbeing  quarantined because they fear the loss  of  income\r\n\r\nand jobs.  There are those who, for reasons best known to\r\n\r\nthemselves,  simply do not want to admit  that  they  are\r\n\r\nsick.   And, as has been said yesterday, there are people\r\n\r\nwho  think  that going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital  in  the\r\n\r\nevent  that they have SARS means stigmatisation by  their\r\n\r\nfriends  and,  worse  still, they  will  die  there.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore  need  to emphasise the positive  side  of  the\r\n\r\nfight  against SARS, as was done yesterday in the  House,\r\n\r\nwhen DPM said that TTSH is in fact a very safe place  and\r\n\r\noffers the best chance of survival in case you get hit by\r\n\r\nSARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I recall that, in the 1950s, when tuberculosis\r\n\r\nwas  prevalent  in Singapore, TTSH was  the  hospital  of\r\n\r\ntreatment  for those suffering from TB.  In  those  days,\r\n\r\nmany  of  the older generation feared going to hospitals.\r\n\r\nGoing  to  TTSH  was, in fact, facing a  death  sentence.\r\n\r\nBut,  over  time,  many also came to  realise  that  TTSH\r\n\r\noffered them the best hope of recovery from tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nI  hope  that  those  who  are  hit  by  SARS  will  also\r\n\r\nunderstand this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYes,  if  you  are  in Tan Tock Seng  Hospital,  you  can\r\n\r\nrecover, you can be saved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about stigmatisation? Here, I would like to\r\n\r\nurge  the  authorities and the media  to  stop  labelling\r\n\r\ncertain  categories of SARS patients as \"super infectors\"\r\n\r\nor  \"super spreaders\".  I think these terms have negative\r\n\r\nconnotations.  In fact, I was upset to read an article in\r\n\r\nthe Straits Times of 11th April which traced the steps of\r\n\r\nhow  SARS  came to Singapore.  What upset me most  was  a\r\n\r\nchart  that  illustrated how it  all  started,  with  the\r\n\r\nheadline  in  very bold print that read:  \"Chain  effect:\r\n\r\nHow  one person infected more than 120 people\", and right\r\n\r\nat  the top of the chart, under the label \"Super spreader\r\n\r\nNo. 1\" was the name of the woman who, through no fault of\r\n\r\nhers, was our first SARS victim.  Her only fault was that\r\n\r\nshe  happened to be on holiday, like what many of us  do,\r\n\r\nand  she  just happened to be in the wrong place  at  the\r\n\r\nwrong time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I sympathise with this person who has already\r\n\r\nsuffered  the loss of her family members and her  pastor.\r\n\r\nBut  I would like to urge the media to stop bandying  her\r\n\r\nname  around  because it does nothing  to  help  her  and\r\n\r\nneither  does  it help us in our efforts to overcome  the\r\n\r\nconcerns of those who fear stigmatisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fighting SARS involves everyone of us. We all\r\n\r\nneed  to  ensure  responsibility, not for ourselves,  but\r\n\r\nalso  for our family members, for our colleagues and  for\r\n\r\nour  fellow citizens.  Much has been said in the past few\r\n\r\ndays  about  what we must do to protect  ourselves.   One\r\n\r\nday,  not  too far in the future, carrying a  thermometer\r\n\r\nwould be as common place as carrying a pen in our pocket.\r\n\r\nThere are many little but significant things we can do to\r\n\r\nsafeguard our personal hygiene.  Perhaps, it is even time\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to consider reviving  the  old  Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean  and  Anti-Littering  Campaigns  because\r\n\r\nthese  campaigns,  in their own ways,  are  efforts  that\r\n\r\ncontribute to a healthier environment for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments therefore in a way reflect the\r\n\r\nstrong stand we are taking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin the fight against SARS.  The World Health Organisation\r\n\r\nhas  stated  that what we are doing are, in  fact,  above\r\n\r\ntheir guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are doing the right thing and we need to\r\n\r\nshow  to  the world that, in fact, Singapore  is  a  safe\r\n\r\nplace, after all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, we would like to take this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to join the many Singaporeans out  there  to\r\n\r\nshow   support,   appreciation   and   to   commend   our\r\n\r\nconscientious  doctors,  nurses  and  related  healthcare\r\n\r\nstaff  assigned  to the frontline duty of  combating  the\r\n\r\nSARS  virus.  Without their dedicated sense of  duty  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility, our society and economy would  have  been\r\n\r\neven more severely crippled.  For their contributions, we\r\n\r\nlook forward to their being individually commended at the\r\n\r\nNational Day Awards Ceremony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we want to thank and appreciate the more\r\n\r\nthan  90%  of  Singaporeans who  have  been  willing  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  in abiding by the quarantine  orders  fully.\r\n\r\nWithout their full cooperation, the war against the  SARS\r\n\r\nvirus would have failed miserably.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we recognise the Government's announcement\r\n\r\nyesterday of a Home Quarantine Allowance scheme of up  to\r\n\r\n$70  per  order  per  day, and an ex-gratia  payment  for\r\n\r\nbusinesses  that  are ordered to be  quarantined.   While\r\n\r\nthis  is not the full compensation for some, it is better\r\n\r\nthan  nothing,  and I think most people under  quarantine\r\n\r\nwill appreciate this small gesture.  I can only hope that\r\n\r\nspecific  individuals with a higher economic  burden  can\r\n\r\napply,  on  a case-by-case basis, for a higher  ex-gratia\r\n\r\nallowance,  if  they have suffered a greater  loss  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the Home Quarantine Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we are happy to note the open and\r\n\r\ntransparent  actions taken by the Ministry of  Health  in\r\n\r\nthis crisis.  By going public and making all information\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\navailable  to  the people, it helps to  build  trust  and\r\n\r\nconfidence  between  our national  institutions  and  the\r\n\r\npeople.   As  an Opposition politician, I am  pleased  to\r\n\r\nprovide  moral and emotional support to the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  in  its tough struggle to combat this virus.   In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  I have strongly refuted calls  from  some\r\n\r\nirate members of the public asking for the resignation of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health for failing to contain the virus\r\n\r\nat its first onset.  They are being unreasonable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Bill under discussion, Sir, we support the\r\n\r\namendments to the Infectious Diseases Act.  We  recognise\r\n\r\nthat there will be a small element of defiant people  out\r\n\r\nthere who will not abide by any orders, and that some  of\r\n\r\nthese unfortunately quarantined individuals may cause the\r\n\r\nwhole containment exercise to fail, if they happen to  be\r\n\r\ninfected and not obeying Home Quarantine Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot allow the efforts of the 90-plus percent\r\n\r\nof  law-abiding quarantined citizens to go  to  waste  by\r\n\r\nhaving a handful of people disobeying the Home Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders  and,  potentially,  endangering  the  health  and\r\n\r\nlivelihood of others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we would like to endorse the Government's move\r\n\r\nto  introduce harsher measures for quarantine  violators.\r\n\r\nIf  fines and electronic tagging do not work for some  of\r\n\r\nthese  irate  violators, I would even  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  publicise  their names  and  let  the  public\r\n\r\nostracise  them.  This will definitely work, because  the\r\n\r\ngeneral public is very concerned about being infected and\r\n\r\nimpacted,  and  will  put great social  pressure  on  the\r\n\r\nviolators to observe the Home Quarantine Orders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our only concern is that Government officials are\r\n\r\nnot  too  trigger-happy  and  start  fining  and  shaming\r\n\r\neveryone,  without  at  least  giving  a  warning  or  an\r\n\r\nopportunity  for the violators to explain their  actions.\r\n\r\nThere  could be some genuine and acceptable reasons  that\r\n\r\nwe may not know of, and we must ensure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  the  harsh  punishment is meted  out  only  to  the\r\n\r\nunrepentant recalcitrant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some people may argue that electronically\r\n\r\ntagging someone for quarantine violations may seem a very\r\n\r\ndrastic  measure and an infringement of civil  liberties.\r\n\r\nBut  I  do  not  think  so.  Most people  will  see  that\r\n\r\nanything which can be done should be done to restrict the\r\n\r\nspread  of  the SARS virus, even if there is  some  human\r\n\r\nright price to pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before concluding, Sir, I have some questions for\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health to respond to.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, why was it that when surgeon Alex Chao was\r\n\r\ncremated  within 24 hours for suspected SARS,  those  who\r\n\r\nhad  treated him while he was in hospital and  those  who\r\n\r\nwere  at  his cremation service were not issued with  any\r\n\r\nquarantine orders?  Is the Ministry of Health  100%  sure\r\n\r\nthat  they are not probable cases, and would it not  have\r\n\r\nbeen  better off for them to be served with HQOs to  play\r\n\r\nit safe?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, if family members can be infected without\r\n\r\nshowing symptoms before any suspect patient dies,  is  it\r\n\r\nnot  better  to  play it safe by issuing Home  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders to the family members, instead of allowing them to\r\n\r\nmix around with friends and others, causing undue anxiety\r\n\r\nand  fear later, if the patient is subsequently found  to\r\n\r\nbe a genuine SARS case?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, if the incubation period is from 3-10 days,\r\n\r\nwould a first quarantined suspect - who may have a longer\r\n\r\nincubation  period  and who later  turns  out  to  be  an\r\n\r\natypical  SARS  case where there is  no  high  fever  and\r\n\r\nliving  with  a  non-quarantined  family  member  with  a\r\n\r\nshorter incubation period of, say, three days - not cause\r\n\r\nthe  spread of the disease unknowingly, if the latter  is\r\n\r\nnot quarantined at all?  Is it not better to play safe to\r\n\r\nquarantine all family members living together, if one  is\r\n\r\nquarantined at all?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we know the disease well enough to take such\r\n\r\nunnecessary risk by exempting one over the other?  I hope\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHealth can be a bit more kiasu in issuing Home Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders.    If  unsure  or  uncertain,  issue   the   Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine Orders first, and then confirm later.  In this\r\n\r\nway,  we will have a better chance of closing all  escape\r\n\r\nroutes totally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if the outbreak should become too serious\r\n\r\nand not contained, then we need to seriously consider  Dr\r\n\r\nTan's recommendation and what I put forward yesterday  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Health, ie, to set up intermediate  and\r\n\r\nseparate  fever  testing centres, away from  TTSH.   This\r\n\r\nwill  cost  additional resources, but  it  will  help  to\r\n\r\nprevent   further  unknowing  spread  through   GPs   and\r\n\r\npolyclinics,  which  may  not be  equipped  to  treat  or\r\n\r\nidentify  SARS effectively.  It will also encourage  more\r\n\r\nof those who are fearful of going to TTSH to come forward\r\n\r\nfor fever testing.  The needed resources can be activated\r\n\r\nfrom  the SAF Field Hospital set-up which, I believe,  is\r\n\r\nwell-trained and prepared for this supporting task.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, and to provide some cheer, I would like\r\n\r\nto  quote a correspondent from the BBC programme that was\r\n\r\naired yesterday morning where he said:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore's containment measures have been very\r\n\r\neffective.   There are fewer than 200 cases in  Singapore\r\n\r\nso far.  People are worried about the virus, but they are\r\n\r\nnot so worried about it at the moment that they cannot go\r\n\r\nabout their daily lives.  So, for the most part, they  do\r\n\r\nseem to be working quite well.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kudos to the Health Team at work. Now is the time\r\n\r\nto be more kiasu, and we will win the battle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I now call upon Dr Vivian Balakrishnan\r\n\r\nto address the House via video.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Vivian Balakrishnan (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the SARS virus\r\n\r\nhas  struck  down more than its fair share of  healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals.  This is because it is most contagious  in\r\n\r\nhospitals  and,  if  you  have unprotected  exposure,  it\r\n\r\nstrikes otherwise fit young professionals in their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprime of life.  All of us practising medicine today  have\r\n\r\nnot  faced  such a situation before, and I  can  honestly\r\n\r\ntell  you  that the practice of medicine will be  changed\r\n\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spent the past one week in the Singapore\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital, and I can tell you that there is  real\r\n\r\nfear  in  the corridors.  This fear does not just  affect\r\n\r\nthe healthcare professionals themselves, but extends also\r\n\r\nto  their  families.  And a few have  made  the  ultimate\r\n\r\nsacrifice.  They have died alone, without touching  their\r\n\r\nrelatives, and with indecently hurried small funerals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we must ask ourselves: why do healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals put themselves in harm's way?  I  can  tell\r\n\r\nyou  it has nothing to do with money, nothing to do  with\r\n\r\nNational Day Awards.  Healthcare professionals face these\r\n\r\nrisks  because  of  a higher calling, a deep  instinctive\r\n\r\nsense  of  duty to care for their patients and for  their\r\n\r\nfellow  human  beings.  This sense of duty is  so  strong\r\n\r\nthat I have had great difficulty forcing the doctors  and\r\n\r\nnurses  to  stand down, in order to rest or  to  recharge\r\n\r\nthemselves during this crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our healthcare professionals do not deny their\r\n\r\nfears.   But  neither  do  they  panic.   They  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary precautions in order to minimise the  risk  and\r\n\r\nquietly get on with their duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the example of healthcare\r\n\r\nprofessionals has some lessons for ordinary Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nMany  of them have asked me, \"Is it safe?  Is it safe  to\r\n\r\ndo  this  or  do  that, or to go to this  place  or  that\r\n\r\nplace?\"   They asked me, \"The Government says 'life  must\r\n\r\ngo  on'.  What do you mean by that?\"  People want a \"Yes\"\r\n\r\nor  a \"No\" answer.  Unfortunately, life is not so simple.\r\n\r\nI wish to make two points to answer these questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, that it is impossible to totally eliminate\r\n\r\nthe  risks, but there is a lot that we can do  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe risks by taking sensible precautions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is not just a matter of personal risk.\r\n\r\nBut our health has an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimpact  on  others around us.  Consequently, we  have  an\r\n\r\nobligation to our families, neighbours and the community.\r\n\r\nAnd social norms must change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first point. We cannot\r\n\r\neliminate  all  risks  totally.   Any  activity  in  life\r\n\r\ncarries  some risk.  But it is possible to minimise  that\r\n\r\nrisk  and get on with that activity.  All of us  need  to\r\n\r\nreview our personal thresholds for risk, and get on  with\r\n\r\ndoing  what  we  need to be done.  In  the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nhealthcare  professionals,  we  accept  a  higher   risk,\r\n\r\nbecause  that is our calling. For everyone else, we  must\r\n\r\ncarry on with our daily activities of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, we must have sensible precautions in place.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry of Health has published a whole long  list,\r\n\r\nand I do not want to belabour the point.  But there is no\r\n\r\npoint  looking  for  absolute protection.   It  does  not\r\n\r\nexist.  But we can protect ourselves to a large extent by\r\n\r\npractising  good personal hygiene, diet, exercise,  self-monitoring of temperature, and the like.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, it is not just a matter of\r\n\r\npersonal risk.  SARS underlines the fact that we are  all\r\n\r\ninterdependent  on each other.  Your health  affects  me,\r\n\r\nand my health affects my family.  Even if I am willing to\r\n\r\ntake  the risk, my family and my friends may not.  I have\r\n\r\nto think of others, and practise social responsibility in\r\n\r\na  very real sense and protect others where possible.  If\r\n\r\nI am ill, I have no right to infect others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to be here, then I must be honest and\r\n\r\ntransparent about it.  I must tell those around me of the\r\n\r\nadded  risk  that  I pose to them.  They  must  have  the\r\n\r\nchance  to decide whether they still wish to be with  me,\r\n\r\nor  they may decide, as this Parliament has, that  it  is\r\n\r\nbetter for me to be in this room, speaking to you  via  a\r\n\r\nvideo link.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our social norms must change. Perhaps, shaking\r\n\r\nhands may not be as common.  We will have to review and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nachieve  the right balance between privacy and collective\r\n\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Singaporeans will look beyond the fines and\r\n\r\nthe penalties that are spelt out in this amendment to the\r\n\r\nInfectious Diseases Act.  If you actually stop  to  think\r\n\r\nabout   it,   this  amendment  places  more,  not   less,\r\n\r\nresponsibility on Singaporeans.  There is  only  so  much\r\n\r\nthat the Government knows, or that the Government can do.\r\n\r\nBut  there  is a lot more that Singaporeans have  got  to\r\n\r\nlearn to do for themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to look beyond this crisis. What would we\r\n\r\nhave  at the end of this crisis?  I think we will have  a\r\n\r\nbetter  society.  Singapore will have a society in  which\r\n\r\nwe have learnt that taking risks is a part of daily life.\r\n\r\nBut  we  would also have learnt that it is silly to  take\r\n\r\nunnecessary  risks.   We would have learnt  that  we  are\r\n\r\nresponsible for each other's survival, and that  we  will\r\n\r\nlive  or  die  together.   We  would  have  developed   a\r\n\r\ncollective instinct, and we would have learnt that,  yes,\r\n\r\nthe Government can do a lot, but there is much, much more\r\n\r\nthat we must do for ourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, the SARS virus would have re-made\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Just like a patient who recovers has  gained\r\n\r\nimmunity  and  strength, I believe a post-SARS  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be stronger, more cohesive and better able to  face\r\n\r\nwhatever comes our way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a chance for the new generation to pass our\r\n\r\nown test of survival, and we will be the better for it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I speak in support\r\n\r\nof the amendments, not only because its legislation is of\r\n\r\npublic health importance, but because I believe it is  an\r\n\r\nimportant  step in the fight for public and international\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore's future and economic recovery.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many fellow Singaporeans would have lost out\r\n\r\non  business deals because they are afraid to  travel  to\r\n\r\nSARS-affected countries, not just because of the risks to\r\n\r\nthemselves but because of the risks that they may pose by\r\n\r\nbringing  the  infection back.  I and my colleagues  have\r\n\r\nskipped medical conferences and speaking engagements  for\r\n\r\nthe  same  reason.  If we do not tackle SARS and  restore\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore as a safe destination,  not  only\r\n\r\nwill our tourism industry, but all of Singapore will face\r\n\r\na bleak future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, measures, such as a very simple\r\n\r\ntemperature   taking   campaign,   prescribe    tangible,\r\n\r\ntransparent,  measurable and logical actions,  would  all\r\n\r\nhelp  rebuild confidence and, in fact, position Singapore\r\n\r\nfavourably  as  a  safer destination in  an  increasingly\r\n\r\ndangerous world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of SARS merely presages a brave new\r\n\r\nworld  where  we  can  expect, from  time  to  time,  new\r\n\r\ndiseases  to appear.  Some may be epidemics of well-known\r\n\r\ndiseases   brought  to  Singapore  by   the   forces   of\r\n\r\nglobalisation; others may be caused by mutations of known\r\n\r\npathogens; still others, completely new agents like SARS,\r\n\r\nand  perhaps even biological agents conceived  originally\r\n\r\nas weapons of terror or mass destruction.  In such cases,\r\n\r\nconventional  medical methods to treat  and  contain  the\r\n\r\ndisease  may fail, as the appropriate cure will  not  yet\r\n\r\nhave  been  found.   If  such  new  diseases  are  highly\r\n\r\ninfectious, one patient appearing in our midst  may  kill\r\n\r\nmany people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, history tells us of several instances of\r\n\r\nthis.   The  Black  Death of Europe,  caused  by  Bubonic\r\n\r\nPlague has been immortalised by the nursery rhyme,  \"Ring\r\n\r\na  ring a rosy, a pocket full of posies, a tissue, a  ah-choo,  a  tissue, all fall down.\"  The advent of  measles\r\n\r\nand  other  viral  diseases among North American  natives\r\n\r\nafter  the  arrival of European settlers actually  killed\r\n\r\noff  many  of  them.   The 1918 influenza  pandemic  also\r\n\r\nkilled  millions around the world.  SARS, therefore,  may\r\n\r\nbe a new disease, but does not represent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  new situation in the world.  We all can learn from the\r\n\r\nlessons of history in dealing with this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first lesson is whether or not we are able to\r\n\r\nsave  the  individual patient.  We must at least  prevent\r\n\r\nthe disease from affecting the entire nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact tracing, quarantining and isolation of index\r\n\r\ncases and at-risk persons can only succeed if all were to\r\n\r\ncooperate.   Firm measures then need to be instituted  to\r\n\r\nensure  compliance, and the loss of some personal freedom\r\n\r\nwould  be  a small price to pay for the survival  of  the\r\n\r\nnation.   We would not need this legislation if  everyone\r\n\r\nwere to cooperate.  Sadly, however, I and my medical  and\r\n\r\nnursing  colleagues will tell you that this is often  not\r\n\r\nat  all  the case.  Doctors are at the mercy of  patients\r\n\r\nwho may not always tell the truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of this Bill will help doctors\r\n\r\nperform their duties more effectively simply because they\r\n\r\nare  more  likely to be told the truth by their patients.\r\n\r\nSome  patients lie to the staff at triage points.  Others\r\n\r\ntry  to  sneak extra visitors past the hospital staff  or\r\n\r\nargue with the staff.  I have had patients telling triage\r\n\r\nstaff  that their kids are well and then admitted  to  me\r\n\r\nthat  actually  their child has been coughing  for  days.\r\n\r\nOthers can be downright anti-social.  One doctor close to\r\n\r\nme  told  me of a patient from Guangdong who deliberately\r\n\r\ncoughed  into her face and the receptionist's  face  when\r\n\r\nasked  whether  he  had come from a SARS-affected  place.\r\n\r\nThis  piece of legislation would help add the  weight  of\r\n\r\nthe law to societal disapproval of this type of obnoxious\r\n\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, what a patient tells his or\r\n\r\nher  doctor  is  confidential.  However, the  Bill  would\r\n\r\ncompel   a  doctor  to  release  information  about   the\r\n\r\npatient's contacts, travel and illnesses to the competent\r\n\r\nauthorities  when the need arises, such  as  during  this\r\n\r\npresent  SARS  crisis.   As a  doctor,  I  see  that  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of confidentiality of information given to  the\r\n\r\ndoctor  will, in these circumstances, need to be  subject\r\n\r\nto the greater good of the majority.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may also hold the view that post-mortems are\r\n\r\nagainst  their  religious beliefs.  However,  it  may  be\r\n\r\ncrucial  to  know,  through  a  post-mortem  examination,\r\n\r\nwhether  the  deceased  has shown signs  that  a  certain\r\n\r\ndisease  has affected the internal organs in  a  specific\r\n\r\nway  not seen in other conditions.  This information  may\r\n\r\nbe  crucial  in a disease such as SARS, where a  reliable\r\n\r\nsingle  test  has yet to be developed, as it  would  then\r\n\r\ndecide whether or not a large group of the living  is  or\r\n\r\nis not at risk, and whether this group needs treatment or\r\n\r\nquarantine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the process of grieving will have to be\r\n\r\nchanged, as the authorities will be empowered to withhold\r\n\r\npermission for wakes for the deceased.  However, we  need\r\n\r\nto  remind ourselves of the reasons why this is so.   The\r\n\r\nbody  of the deceased and the personal effects may  still\r\n\r\nbe   infectious.   Persons  close  to  the  deceased  may\r\n\r\nunwittingly  be  harbouring  the  disease  in  its  early\r\n\r\nstages.  While this may not be applicable to SARS,  there\r\n\r\nmay  be diseases where even well-looking people could  be\r\n\r\ntransmitting  the disease.  The law must  therefore  make\r\n\r\nthe necessary provisions for this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge though, that when an individual has to\r\n\r\nbe  jailed  because  he  or  she  is  in  breach  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of this Bill, he or she should still  have  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to have access to appropriate medical attention,\r\n\r\nand  that the other inmates of the facility or prison  be\r\n\r\nprotected from the hazards of this disease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also urge that when the law is implemented\r\n\r\non   the  ground,  medical  practitioners  can  be  given\r\n\r\npractical assistance to help refer uncooperative  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public to the proper authorities for appropriate\r\n\r\nactions.   It  is  unlikely that  medical  workers  would\r\n\r\nknowingly  contravene the provisions  of  this  amendment\r\n\r\nBill.  It would be helpful if the law were to assist them\r\n\r\nin  this regard.  As a doctor in a restructured hospital,\r\n\r\nI know my colleagues and I face the daily stress of SARS.\r\n\r\nOur  patient  load is down but the stress  load  is  much\r\n\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will help us to breathe a little easier.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of my other healthcare workers, I would like to\r\n\r\nthank Members of this House and members of the public for\r\n\r\ntheir  many  expressions of support.  These gestures  are\r\n\r\nmuch appreciated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I now call upon Dr Ng Eng Hen to\r\n\r\naddress the House via video.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen): Mr Speaker and Members of Central Command\r\n\r\nSingapore, this is the SARS combat unit reporting.  It is\r\n\r\nthe  43th day of battle since the SARS enemy entered  our\r\n\r\nterritory.  I have been embedded in the flanking  private\r\n\r\nhospital  division this past week. They  have  seen  some\r\n\r\nskirmishes but they have managed to beat back the  enemy.\r\n\r\nThe private hospital division remains intact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this enemy is not to be underestimated. We\r\n\r\nshould  fear  and  respect it.  The  SARS  enemy  uses  a\r\n\r\ncunning  strategy.  It attaches bombs  onto  our  people.\r\n\r\nThese  bombs are invisible.  We do not have any  test  to\r\n\r\ndetect  these  bombs.  They cause a fever which  triggers\r\n\r\nexplosions   that  send  even  more  bombs  that   attach\r\n\r\nthemselves  to people around them and infect them.   This\r\n\r\nsequence is repeated.  Sir, the enemy uses our own people\r\n\r\nto multiply itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to prevent further spread, we have had to\r\n\r\nrestrict  movement and change social  customs.   We  tell\r\n\r\npeople where to go when they are sick and we do not  even\r\n\r\nallow  visitors to visit them when they are in  hospital.\r\n\r\nWe quarantine people in their homes, close schools, close\r\n\r\nbusinesses.  We even deny some a proper funeral.   We  do\r\n\r\nnot  like  doing these things but we do them  to  protect\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  protect  our  livelihoods.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ndifficult time for all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not seen such an enemy since the 1950s when\r\n\r\nwe  closed  schools because of the polio epidemic.   This\r\n\r\nnational crisis is unprecedented. Our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople have become fearful.  Some fear everything.   They\r\n\r\nfear  other  people,  taxis,  buses,  vegetables,  banks,\r\n\r\nhawker centres, shopping malls.  This fear paralyses  all\r\n\r\nof us and is even a greater threat than the SARS bombs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I have some good news. The Group\r\n\r\ncommander,  Lim  Hng  Kiang, has not  been  `shocked  and\r\n\r\nawed'.   Instead,  he and his generals  have  launched  a\r\n\r\ncounter-offensive swiftly and decisively.  His battalions\r\n\r\n-  Alexandra Hospital, Changi General Hospital, SGH, NUH,\r\n\r\nKKH,  Tan  Tock  Seng Hospital - have  been  magnificent.\r\n\r\nThey have managed to isolate and contain 84% of the enemy\r\n\r\ninto  our hospitals and 12% into houses.  Only 4% escaped\r\n\r\ntheir  ring-fencing.  Other foreign armies  have  noticed\r\n\r\nour   efforts.    One  of  them  gave  us  the   ultimate\r\n\r\ncompliment.   He said, \"If Singapore cannot contain  this\r\n\r\nenemy, no one else can.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once isolated, these bombs on our people have to be\r\n\r\ndisarmed  and  disposed.   The  Tan  Tock  Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nbattalion  is  our main bomb disposal  unit.   They  have\r\n\r\nspecially  trained personnel to disarm bombs.  They  wear\r\n\r\nprotective  gear  when  they  do  this,  otherwise   they\r\n\r\nthemselves risk getting wounded or killed. The  Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng  Hospital battalion has done well and, for the  last\r\n\r\nfour  weeks, no explosions have occurred and no  one  has\r\n\r\nbeen  infected  by SARS bombs in Tan Tock Seng  Hospital.\r\n\r\nIt  is not humanly possible for them to keep this perfect\r\n\r\nrecord.   And indeed, one of their troops, a doctor,  may\r\n\r\nhave  been  infected last week.  But  after  these  minor\r\n\r\nbreakthroughs,  they  are  on  renewed  alert  and   have\r\n\r\ntightened their protection.  They have been able to  save\r\n\r\n92% of our Singaporeans who have been infected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, as I have said, the enemy is cunning.\r\n\r\nSARS can disguise its bombs and many have triggered these\r\n\r\nbombs while handling it unknowingly and unprotected.  The\r\n\r\nother   battalions  at  SGH,  KKH,  NUH,  Changi  General\r\n\r\nHospital  were affected this way.  Half of those  wounded\r\n\r\nhave been these healthcare workers.  Some have died.  But\r\n\r\nwe are getting more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncareful  and  have  learnt from our mistakes.   They  are\r\n\r\nfighting to eliminate pockets of resistance and we can be\r\n\r\nproud of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked how it is that Tan Tock Seng Hospital\r\n\r\nhas  managed not to have any explosions.  To find out,  I\r\n\r\nwent  to  see  their bomb disposal unit.  I stepped  into\r\n\r\ntheir ICU last Sunday.  This is the place where bombs are\r\n\r\nlikely  to  go off, if handled wrongly.  Why  did  I  go?\r\n\r\nWell, Sub-Commander Khaw and I needed to see how they  do\r\n\r\nit  so that we could assure other troops that it could be\r\n\r\ndone.   And their officer, Lim Suet Wun, told  us  it  is\r\n\r\nsafe.   He  and his other officers walk around  Tan  Tock\r\n\r\nSeng Hospital routinely every day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not worry, Sir, I did not touch or trigger any\r\n\r\nbombs, but we wore protective gear anyway.  The staff  at\r\n\r\nthe  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital are expert and professional.\r\n\r\nThey do their work with a measured calm and routine.   My\r\n\r\nheart swelled with pride when I saw how they worked. They\r\n\r\nare  confident with their own protection and go  home  to\r\n\r\ntheir families after work for comfort and support.   Some\r\n\r\ncivilians though are less understanding.  Initially, they\r\n\r\nshunned  these  Tan Tock Seng Hospital workers  and  some\r\n\r\nchased them out of their homes.  But recently, they  have\r\n\r\ngiven  their full support to our healthcare worker  (HCW)\r\n\r\ntroops.  The nation is rallying, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked if our troops in the hospital\r\n\r\nunderstand  the importance of their mission.   Without  a\r\n\r\ndoubt.  They know the consequences of failure.  They  are\r\n\r\naware  that  this  is a defining moment for  the  medical\r\n\r\ncommunity.   If  they  allow  the  SARS  enemy  into  the\r\n\r\ncommunity, more bombs will go off and lives will be  lost\r\n\r\nand  our livelihoods will suffer.  Hotels and restaurants\r\n\r\nwill  remain  empty.   Taxis  will  wait  for  hours  for\r\n\r\npassengers.   Markets, schools and public areas  will  be\r\n\r\ndeserted.   Tourists will not come back.   Other  nations\r\n\r\nwill  shun  Singaporeans.  The nation  depends  on  them.\r\n\r\nThey know this well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked about morale. It is steady. But\r\n\r\nsomething has happened that will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsabotage the efforts and destroy the morale and  we  will\r\n\r\nlose this war.  Singaporeans who know they have bombs  on\r\n\r\nthem  are  not  going  to the right bomb  disposal  unit.\r\n\r\nWorse still, they do not warn the doctors that they  have\r\n\r\nbombs  on them.  Singaporeans lie or withhold information\r\n\r\nof  contact or travel to SARS-affected regions.  They  go\r\n\r\nto  Guangdong  and  do not tell the doctors.   They  have\r\n\r\ncontacts with family and friends with suspected SARS  and\r\n\r\nthis  information  is not told.  So our  troops  did  not\r\n\r\nisolate these people and touch them unprotected.  In some\r\n\r\ncases,  the  bombs  went off and the  doctors  and  those\r\n\r\naround  them were wounded and infected.  Some with  bombs\r\n\r\nare  frightened and stayed at home, until they  are  very\r\n\r\nsick.   Even  then they refused to go to  Tan  Tock  Seng\r\n\r\nHospital  and  instead go to other Accident  &  Emergency\r\n\r\nUnits.  They collapsed but healthcare workers do not know\r\n\r\nthat  they have SARS bombs on them.  Many procedures  are\r\n\r\nperformed  on  them by our unprotected  troops  and  more\r\n\r\nbombs  go  off.  Still others, with exploding bombs,  are\r\n\r\ntold  to stay put, but they walked right into public  and\r\n\r\ncrowded places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our healthcare workers are pleading to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   They  say:  we are willing  to  risk  our\r\n\r\nlives  to  disarm you, but please give  us  a  chance  to\r\n\r\nprotect  ourselves and others around you.   Let  us  know\r\n\r\nthat  you have been in contact with SARS patients or have\r\n\r\ntravelled to affected places.  If you have SARS bomb,  go\r\n\r\nto  the Tan Tock Seng Hospital to be disarmed.  The  SARS\r\n\r\ncombat  units  are  prepared  to  fight  the  enemy  but,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  please  do not shoot  and  kill  your  own\r\n\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our healthcare workers are willing to lay down\r\n\r\ntheir lives to protect and heal Singaporeans.  Some, like\r\n\r\nDr Ong and Dr Chao, have died.  I knew Dr Chao who was  a\r\n\r\nfew  years  younger  than  I  was.   He  has  often  been\r\n\r\ndescribed  as the son of the late-famous Professor  Chao.\r\n\r\nHe  himself  was a likeable and very talented  character.\r\n\r\nHe  had  his MBBS in 1989 and FRCS four years  later.   I\r\n\r\nremember my recollections of him.  I had taken a  holiday\r\n\r\nin Sydney\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  my  family  and there he was with  his  father,  as\r\n\r\nusual,  looking for good food.  Both of them  were  burly\r\n\r\ncharacters.   They have what the French  called  joie  de\r\n\r\nvivre  - joy of living.  When I entered political office,\r\n\r\nI  thought  of  Alex as a suitable candidate  perhaps  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  to  the party.  He could sing very  well,  was\r\n\r\nentertaining,  extremely likeable, talented  and  bright.\r\n\r\nBut  in  1999  he  was doing his vascular  fellowship  in\r\n\r\nSydney.   We  will  never know whether  Alex  could  have\r\n\r\ncontributed more to society.  He sacrificed his  life  to\r\n\r\nprotect our nation, caring for SARS patients.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not let the sacrifices be in vain.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  must be truthful and responsible.   We  can\r\n\r\novercome this enemy.  Even if Singaporeans choose to lie,\r\n\r\nour healthcare workers would still pledge to protect you.\r\n\r\nThis is their sacred duty and they will do it even if  it\r\n\r\ncosts them their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you asked what the next battle plan is. We\r\n\r\nmust continue to isolate and contain these SARS bombs  in\r\n\r\nhospitals.  Then the rest of Singapore can go  on  living\r\n\r\nand  working.  They need to do this to get more resources\r\n\r\nto  help  our  troops fight this enemy.  It is  a  costly\r\n\r\nfight  but we cannot afford to lose.  We stand and  fight\r\n\r\nunited.  This Bill will help our fight.  I support it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at the moment, SARS is\r\n\r\nseriously threatening us. Due to the fear and reaction to\r\n\r\nthis  threat, our economy and even our social  lives  are\r\n\r\naffected.  In order that life could go back to normal, we\r\n\r\nmust control the spread of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretically, if every Singaporean assumes his own\r\n\r\nresponsibility, for example, everyone who has been  to  a\r\n\r\nSARS-affected  area  or in contact  with  suspected  SARS\r\n\r\npatients  should isolate himself, and everyone who  shows\r\n\r\nsymptoms of SARS infection should go to the hospital  for\r\n\r\nexamination  and  treatment, then  we  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncontain the spread of SARS.  But, in reality, the  matter\r\n\r\nis not that simple. We have a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npastor who visited his church member to pray for her  but\r\n\r\nended  up getting infected himself and succumbed  to  the\r\n\r\ndisease.  We  have  also an affected  person  who  simply\r\n\r\nrefused to accept the fact that he had been affected with\r\n\r\nSARS, and went doctor-hopping, thereby causing the entire\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  to  be shut down, and   a  lot  of  people\r\n\r\ninconvenienced.  We have also the founder of an education\r\n\r\ncentre, presumably one who is well-educated, who recently\r\n\r\nreturned  from  Guangzhou, a declared SARS-affected  area\r\n\r\n(he  had  fever in Guangzhou) but refused to be  examined\r\n\r\nand  even escaped from the hospital where he was isolated\r\n\r\nfor  observation.  If we have in our midst more  of  such\r\n\r\nignorant  and irresponsible persons, then our efforts  to\r\n\r\ncontain SARS would be made much more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from mobilising all our people to be on the\r\n\r\nalert  and  to  expose  the  irresponsible  ones  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity,  we  should  also  have  good  legislation  to\r\n\r\nseverely punish and physically force those who choose not\r\n\r\nto  comply with the isolation orders. The introduction of\r\n\r\nthis  Amendment Bill is most timely, and  I  support  it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to make a few observations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, how do we deal with any person who may have\r\n\r\nbeen  infected with SARS, refused to go and see a doctor,\r\n\r\nbut  preferred  to  stay at home by taking  some  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine and herbs, and hoping that he will be cured?  In\r\n\r\nthe process, his family members, and even his neighbours,\r\n\r\nwould  get  into  trouble.   The  proposed  amendment  to\r\n\r\nsection  4(10) of the principal Act seeks to require  any\r\n\r\nmedical practitioner to obtain from his patient,  who  is\r\n\r\nsuspected  to  be  a  case or carrier  or  contact,  such\r\n\r\ninformation  relating to his contact  with  any  infected\r\n\r\npersons, and to transmit such information to the relevant\r\n\r\nauthority.  But how extensive is the coverage of the term\r\n\r\n\"medical practitioner\"?  As we know, there are people who\r\n\r\nprefer  to seek alternative treatment for their  illness.\r\n\r\nSome  go  to Chinese physicians, while others may  go  to\r\n\r\nacupuncturists, and even foot reflexologists  instead  of\r\n\r\nwestern   doctors  for  treatment.  If  we   talk   about\r\n\r\nhealthcare\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproviders, then I think we should also include all  these\r\n\r\npeople - the Chinese physicians, acupuncturists and  foot\r\n\r\nreflexologists.  In  this  way,  the  coverage  is   more\r\n\r\ncomprehensive. The identity of any suspected case will be\r\n\r\npicked  up  and  sent  to  Tan Tock  Seng  Hospital  much\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed new section 14 of the Bill deals with\r\n\r\nthe funerals of the deceased SARS patients. We read about\r\n\r\nthis  person  who  died on 14th April,  and  it  was  not\r\n\r\nascertained whether or not she died of SARS.  There was a\r\n\r\nwake for three nights and, as a result, many friends  and\r\n\r\nrelatives  of  the family are now worried that  they  may\r\n\r\nhave  been  infected.  So this was something that  should\r\n\r\nhave  been  contained.  Yet, it was only on  24th  April,\r\n\r\nsome  10 days after her death, that she was confirmed  to\r\n\r\nhave  died of SARS. Can the Minister please enlighten  us\r\n\r\nhow such an event could be prevented from occurring again\r\n\r\nunder the amended law?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also this new section 17(5) of the Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  says  that  any  person  who,  without  reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse,  contravenes an order under subsection (3)  shall\r\n\r\nbe  guilty of an offence. I think this is misleading.  It\r\n\r\nwould appear that anyone who violates the order could get\r\n\r\naway with it so long as he can come out with a reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse.   This  will  surely  lead  to  some  unnecessary\r\n\r\ntrouble.   In my opinion, the phrase \"without  reasonable\r\n\r\nexcuse\" should be deleted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind that the first three index cases\r\n\r\nactually  caught the virus when they were on  a  shopping\r\n\r\nholiday  in Hong Kong, we should require anyone  who  has\r\n\r\ngone   overseas   on  official  duty  or   otherwise   to\r\n\r\nconscientiously check his temperature for at least  three\r\n\r\ndays  upon his return to Singapore to see whether or  not\r\n\r\nhe  has been infected.  If he has visited a SARS-affected\r\n\r\narea  or  country,  then he would need  to  impose  self-quarantine for 10 days. Nowadays, many organisations  are\r\n\r\nmaking  arrangements  to  this effect.   Some  Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and statutory boards are sectionalising their\r\n\r\noffices  so that, if anyone is infected, only the section\r\n\r\nin which he works will be quarantined.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in Singapore we should send a very clear and\r\n\r\nprecise  signal  to our people.  If you  go  to  a  SARS-affected   country   or  area,   then   you   have   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility to impose self-isolation for 10 days.   If\r\n\r\nthis had been done earlier, the three primary index cases\r\n\r\nwould   not  have  infected  so  many  people   and   the\r\n\r\nconsequential  effects on our economy  and  social  lives\r\n\r\nwould have been minimised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry of Health should make it very\r\n\r\nclear  to  all the people that if anyone is  to  visit  a\r\n\r\nforeign  country, he would have to check his  temperature\r\n\r\nat  least  twice a day for three days upon his return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   If  he has been to any of the  SARS-affected\r\n\r\nareas, then he will have to impose self-isolation for  10\r\n\r\ndays, upon his return to Singapore.  I think this will be\r\n\r\nvery  effective  in  preventing this disease  from  being\r\n\r\nbrought into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I speak in support of the Bill whose  main\r\n\r\nthrust is to strengthen enforcement measures to curb  the\r\n\r\nspread  of  infectious diseases such  as  SARS.   Current\r\n\r\nenforcement  provisions need to be enhanced so  that  the\r\n\r\nspread  of  diseases such as SARS can be  contained  more\r\n\r\neffectively.   I  also appreciate the compelling  reasons\r\n\r\nwhy  the  Government  sought to  have  this  Bill  passed\r\n\r\nurgently.   These  points  had been  raised  by  speakers\r\n\r\nbefore me.  Sir, while I agree with the general intent of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill, I wish to raise a certain concern.  It relates\r\n\r\nin  particular  to clause 5 of the Bill  as  regards  the\r\n\r\nproposed section 14.  This point was touched by Dr Warren\r\n\r\nLee  and  Assoc. Prof. Low before me.  Section  14(1)  as\r\n\r\nproposed, provides, amongst others, that the Director  be\r\n\r\nempowered to prohibit the wake of a person who was a case\r\n\r\nor contact of SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, funeral rites and wakes are serious events.\r\n\r\nThey  are  important  to the majority  of,  if  not  all,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  They are of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngreat religious and personal significance.  The need  for\r\n\r\nthis  particular  amendment must be  explained  properly.\r\n\r\nThe  people have to be made to understand why it  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Director to  make  such  prohibition\r\n\r\norders   in   certain  circumstances,  and   what   these\r\n\r\ncircumstances   are  must  also  be  explained   clearly.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,  this clause may appear to be  an  affront  to\r\n\r\nreligious  beliefs or social norms dearly  held  by  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.     Without   adequate    explanation,    a\r\n\r\nprohibition order under this proposed section  is  likely\r\n\r\nto  stigmatise the SARS victim and his family.  This only\r\n\r\nadds  to the stress and trauma suffered by family members\r\n\r\nof the deceased victim, in addition to their bereavement.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of a prohibition order may even act as  a\r\n\r\ndisincentive for a SARS case, carrier or contact, or  his\r\n\r\nfamily members from owning up and being examined for SARS\r\n\r\nas  they  fear being deprived of proper funeral rites  in\r\n\r\nthe event of death.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Sir, such an order would cause\r\n\r\nconsternation to religious groups who may feel that their\r\n\r\nreligious beliefs are not sufficiently respected  by  the\r\n\r\nState.    In  the  premises,  there  is  merit  to   make\r\n\r\nprovisions  to ensure that the Director does  two  things\r\n\r\nprior  to  issuing the prohibition order.   Firstly,  the\r\n\r\nDirector  should consult the relevant religious authority\r\n\r\nfor views and advice.  Secondly, the Director should also\r\n\r\ncounsel the immediate family members of the deceased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, Sir, that the measures proposed would go\r\n\r\nin  some  way  to make the otherwise harsh but  necessary\r\n\r\nmeasures  more  humane, more acceptable,  and  thus  more\r\n\r\nreadily supported.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe   measures  proposed  in  the  Bill  are  harsh   but\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Health Ministry for all its good work\r\n\r\nin trying to contain the spread of SARS, and plugging all\r\n\r\nthe holes so that we can be kept safe from SARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to go all out to break the chain of\r\n\r\ninfection in Singapore.  What one\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nindividual  does, if he is exposed to SARS,  or  what  he\r\n\r\ndoes  not  do, can affect the entire nation.   We  cannot\r\n\r\nrisk  the  spread  of  SARS  into  the  wider  community,\r\n\r\nespecially given the fact that Singapore is such a  small\r\n\r\nand compact place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a good sign that Singaporeans are flowing back\r\n\r\ninto  the  streets, going out to restaurants and cinemas.\r\n\r\nI took my parents to watch a movie last weekend.  We went\r\n\r\nto  the  Cineplex in town and found that the 7.30 pm  and\r\n\r\n<br>9.30 pm shows were almost sold out by 7.00 pm. None of\r\n\r\nthe people thronging the Cineplex or the shopping complex\r\n\r\nwas  wearing  a  mask.  This is all a sign of  confidence\r\n\r\nthat  we  are on top of the situation.  We must build  on\r\n\r\nthis  confidence.  But people will only feel  safe  going\r\n\r\nout  and  carrying on with their lives if they  are  sure\r\n\r\nthat  those who are sick, those who might have SARS,  are\r\n\r\nat  home and not going out.  If they believe that  it  is\r\n\r\neasy for those who are on Home Quarantine Orders to break\r\n\r\nit and roam about, then their level of confidence will be\r\n\r\nshaken.  We cannot allow that to happen.  We cannot allow\r\n\r\nfear to rule our lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, it is important that we do not treat\r\n\r\nthose  on  HQOs like criminals.  They did not ask  to  be\r\n\r\nexposed  to the SARS virus, and it is a frightening  time\r\n\r\nfor  them.  Their fear is real, as they have been exposed\r\n\r\nto  SARS  suspects.   They deserve our understanding  and\r\n\r\ncompassion.   Although regular checks are made  on  them,\r\n\r\nthey  must  be  treated humanely.   The  Health  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  explain to them very clearly the reasons for  the\r\n\r\nHQO and why it is necessary that they obey it and stay at\r\n\r\nhome.   Many  of those served with HQOs so  far  are  the\r\n\r\nolder people and the lower-educated.  They may need  more\r\n\r\nhelp to understand the need for the HQO.  They should not\r\n\r\nbe  made  to feel like criminals - until they  break  the\r\n\r\nHQO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask the Minister what is being done to make\r\n\r\nsure  that  those on HQOs have easy access  to  food  and\r\n\r\nother  daily necessities that they need to purchase?   We\r\n\r\nalso need to address the fears of their neighbours.  Some\r\n\r\nresidents know that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir neighbours are on HQOs and they do not know how  to\r\n\r\nreact to it.  Often, they react to it with fear.  I  know\r\n\r\nof  some residents who have moved away to stay with their\r\n\r\nrelatives  in  other parts of the island just  to  escape\r\n\r\nliving  in  the same block of those who have been  served\r\n\r\nwith HQOs.  Can I ask the Minister what is being done  to\r\n\r\nallay  the concerns and fears of residents who are living\r\n\r\nnext to those served with HQOs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also stop the rumours flying about on\r\n\r\nthe spread of SARS.  Almost daily, there are SMS-es and e-mails  spreading  rumours  of SARS  infecting  a  certain\r\n\r\ndepartment store, a certain school, a certain supermarket\r\n\r\nor,  a  certain person.  Such rumours fan  the  fears  of\r\n\r\npeople  and they complicate our efforts to get people  to\r\n\r\nlive their lives as normally as possible.  People hearing\r\n\r\nthe rumours can over-react and they avoid the places.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other countries, Singapore's Government\r\n\r\nhas been very open and transparent with the new cases and\r\n\r\nthe  spread  of  the  infection.   This  should  minimise\r\n\r\nrumours.   The  public  should also  be  able  to  verify\r\n\r\nrumours by calling up the SARS hotline.  But, Sir,  those\r\n\r\nwho  persist  in spreading rumours about SARS  should  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with  firmly by the law.  They should  be  treated\r\n\r\nlike  those  who are guilty of bomb hoaxes.  Both  spread\r\n\r\nfear  by  scaring  the  public with  false  alarms.   The\r\n\r\nmaximum fine for transmitting a hoax message in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  seven  years in jail and a $50,000 fine.   We  should\r\n\r\nsend a strong message to all those who spread rumours  on\r\n\r\nSARS, just as we send a strong message to those who break\r\n\r\nthe HQOs: Stop it, or you will be dealt with by the law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I believe that our battle against SARS can\r\n\r\nbe turned into a positive thing.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we already see heroes emerging among us.\r\n\r\nOther than the healthcare workers at the frontline of the\r\n\r\nbattle,   we   have  also  seen  community  leaders   and\r\n\r\nvolunteers working so hard at helping us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  build confidence on the ground.  Their work is  often\r\n\r\nunnoticed, unglamorous but very important.  If I may give\r\n\r\nan  example of the Chairman of my constituency's  Hawkers\r\n\r\nand Merchants Association, Mr Soh Peck Kiat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father had just died from a heart attack, and Mr\r\n\r\nSoh  had not slept for the last few nights because of the\r\n\r\nfuneral wake.  In fact, I just went to his father's  wake\r\n\r\non  Monday night, and I saw him looking very tired.   His\r\n\r\neyes  were all red.  And I told him, \"Please don't  worry\r\n\r\nabout  our  grassroots work.  Let  us  handle  this  SARS\r\n\r\noutbreak  -  we will take care of the need to spread  the\r\n\r\nmessage  to  the  residents ourselves.\"  So  I  appointed\r\n\r\nsomebody else to take over.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mr Soh shares our concern about containing SARS\r\n\r\nand  insisted,  even though he is in deep mourning,  even\r\n\r\nthough he has hardly slept, on coming down at 6.00 in the\r\n\r\nmorning  to help us take the temperatures of the  hawkers\r\n\r\nand   to  spread  the  message  to  the  people  who  are\r\n\r\npatronising  the market and the hawkers of  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontain  SARS.  I could see his unwavering commitment  to\r\n\r\nsafeguarding the well-being of our residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we would not have been able to build the\r\n\r\nconfidence  on  the  ground so  effectively  without  the\r\n\r\nselfless and untiring work of such grassroots volunteers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would also like to salute the\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Ministerial Combat Unit,  whom  we  have\r\n\r\nheard from, who have worked so hard to contain SARS  from\r\n\r\nspreading within the hospitals.  I think they have done a\r\n\r\ngood job, and we wish them well.  Their work is also  not\r\n\r\nwithout risk.  Sir, we need the help of every citizen  to\r\n\r\ncombat SARS.  It is not only the job of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another positive aspect to the SARS\r\n\r\noutbreak,  and it is this.   The threat of terrorism  has\r\n\r\nnot vanished.  One reason why bombs have not gone off in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  is because we have made ourselves a very  hard\r\n\r\ntarget.   So  they had gone off and bombed Bali  instead.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have been quite worried about biological weapons\r\n\r\nfalling  into the hands of terrorists.  Indeed,  this  is\r\n\r\none  reason  why  we supported the war against  Iraq.   I\r\n\r\nthink, after terrorists see how Singapore has reacted  so\r\n\r\nswiftly to counter SARS and in such a united manner, they\r\n\r\nwill think twice about using biological weapons to attack\r\n\r\nSingapore.  It is just not worth their while.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have shown the world that, together, we can\r\n\r\novercome  any  crisis that comes  our  way.   Even  if  a\r\n\r\nlunatic  decides to use biological weapons in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are well prepared for it, thanks  to  their\r\n\r\nexperience with SARS.  We have put in place a  series  of\r\n\r\nmeasures  and a whole slew of laws to deal with  it.   We\r\n\r\nare psychologically prepared to deal with any outbreak.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is one step towards making sure that we\r\n\r\nare  prepared for any eventualities.  Hence,  I  give  my\r\n\r\nfull support to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, SARS has\r\n\r\nbeen  with us for some six weeks since mid-March.   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think that we would claim to know all that there  is\r\n\r\nabout the virus - far from it.  But we have been learning\r\n\r\npainfully but quickly, and the enemy is now no longer  so\r\n\r\nunknown to us.  We have the experience of TTSH which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  leading the vanguard of our troops in this  battle.\r\n\r\nWe know what we need to do to beat the bug.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not surprised that our healthcare workers have\r\n\r\nresponded without hesitation to the situation, their  own\r\n\r\nfears  notwithstanding.  All our days and all  our  hours\r\n\r\nare  now  focused on SARS-related needs and issues.   Not\r\n\r\njust our frontline healthcare workers, but our staff  who\r\n\r\nare  usually  in  the  backroom have been  mobilised  and\r\n\r\ntrained  to help with screening and triaging and  contact\r\n\r\ntracing, and all of them have responded to take on  these\r\n\r\nnew and additional duties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first challenge was coming to a realisation of\r\n\r\nthis  new  enemy  in  our  midst.   Next,  coming  to  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of what it takes to deal with  it.   For  a\r\n\r\nwhile,  we  hesitated,  still  trying  to  balance  tough\r\n\r\nmeasures and restrictions with concerns about convenience\r\n\r\nand  compassion  for  our  patients  and  their  visiting\r\n\r\nfamilies.  I think we are well past this now, recognising\r\n\r\nwhat is necessary for the greater good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have put a high level of precautions and\r\n\r\nprotective  measures in place in our hospitals,  we  must\r\n\r\nwork  hard and relentlessly on getting out of old  habits\r\n\r\nand  old  practices and being constantly on  high  alert,\r\n\r\nconstantly remembering all the small but important things\r\n\r\nthat  we  should do and must do and cannot do as we  look\r\n\r\nafter  our patients, never letting our guard drop.   This\r\n\r\nis very hard to do, but we must try our best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will beat this bug. But the path ahead will be\r\n\r\nuneven  and we will not get to our destination overnight.\r\n\r\nIn  our hospitals in the coming weeks, we will have  good\r\n\r\ndays free of news of new infection, and bad days when the\r\n\r\nfrailty  of  human  nature results in  a  breach  in  our\r\n\r\nprecautions and consequent minor setbacks.   So  long  as\r\n\r\nthese  are minor and isolated setbacks, we will still  be\r\n\r\nin  reasonable shape.  Our biggest challenge now  is  not\r\n\r\nthe immediate mobilisation to the highest level of alert.\r\n\r\nIt  will  be the ability to sustain these efforts  beyond\r\n\r\nthe  immediate into the mid-term, beyond next  week  into\r\n\r\nnext month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what is constantly on my mind these days,\r\n\r\neven as I am nagging, hassling and encouraging my people,\r\n\r\nas  we  are  ramping up our measures how to sustain  this\r\n\r\nextraordinary effort for the longer term.  To  help  ease\r\n\r\nthe burden on our hospitals and healthcare workers and to\r\n\r\nsimplify  our  tasks,  we need the public's  support  and\r\n\r\ncooperation   to   accept   these   inconveniences    and\r\n\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that we will beat this bug. But to\r\n\r\ndo  so,  we  need to work together with the understanding\r\n\r\nand cooperation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  the public and, where necessary, with the backing  of\r\n\r\nthe  force  of the law.  The proposed amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nInfectious  Diseases Act will give Government the  muscle\r\n\r\nand the tools to do this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  rightly placed the highest  priority  in\r\n\r\ncontaining  the  spread  of SARS.   It  would  have  been\r\n\r\npreferred  if  there was no need to resort to  punishment\r\n\r\nand   social  responsibility  was  enough.   But  it   is\r\n\r\ndisturbing that some have chosen to breach the quarantine\r\n\r\norders.   Those who may be tempted to breach such  orders\r\n\r\nmust  be  deterred  from  doing  so  before  the  problem\r\n\r\nballoons out of control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that quick and effective measures\r\n\r\nare  indeed  appropriate under such a  crisis  situation.\r\n\r\nSingapore is already suffering painful consequences  from\r\n\r\nSARS, not just in terms of healthcare challenges but also\r\n\r\neconomically.   This  is a time where  every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nshould rally behind the Government in its effort to fight\r\n\r\nSARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill and urge the Government to spare\r\n\r\nno  effort  in  ensuring that Singaporeans are  protected\r\n\r\nuntil a vaccine is found.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  thank all Members for their very strong support\r\n\r\nof  the  amendments in the Bill.  I think,  in  the  same\r\n\r\nspirit shown by Mr Low Thia Khiang, I would also be short\r\n\r\nin my response.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to make a few key points and summarise\r\n\r\nwhat many Members have said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I think we all agree that tough\r\n\r\nmeasures are necessary.  Without these tough measures, we\r\n\r\ncannot  win  this war.  Second, we must  all  be  united.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  a  fight by the healthcare workers  alone.\r\n\r\nThis  is not a fight by the Government alone.  This is  a\r\n\r\nfight by all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Third, if we want Singaporeans to join  us\r\n\r\nin  this fight, we must educate them.  We must tell  them\r\n\r\nthe  facts and they must be convinced that this is  their\r\n\r\nfight.  Otherwise, they will not join us in the trenches.\r\n\r\nSo public education is very important and we will take in\r\n\r\nall  the  suggestions that Members have made and we  will\r\n\r\nimprove  our  public  education.   Fourth,  we  must   be\r\n\r\nmentally prepared for the long haul.  As Dr Jennifer  Lee\r\n\r\nsays,  there will be ups and downs, there will  be  small\r\n\r\nvictories,  there  will  be some setbacks,  but  we  must\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves.  This is going to  be  for  the  long\r\n\r\nhaul.   We  must look for sustainable strategies  and  we\r\n\r\nmust  look for sustainable efforts.  At the end, we  will\r\n\r\novercome.  Because we all know that too much is at  stake\r\n\r\nand  we  must  all  unite to make sure we  overcome  this\r\n\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, I think, are the key points made by most\r\n\r\nMembers.   I would not go into the detailed responses  to\r\n\r\nall  the  various issues raised.  I will get my staff  to\r\n\r\nsend the responses to Members individually.  I think that\r\n\r\nis  more efficient.  But I just want to cover a few areas\r\n\r\nwhich  are  of  public  concern.  First,  the  Quarantine\r\n\r\nOrders.  I have explained yesterday the need for the Home\r\n\r\nQuarantine  Orders  and  why  it  is  so  important,  our\r\n\r\nstrategy to isolate people who have contact with  suspect\r\n\r\nSARS, or probable SARS cases, keep them in their home and\r\n\r\nthen isolate them so as to prevent the spread.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is worth reiterating that the people who\r\n\r\nare  placed on Home Quarantine Orders are generally well.\r\n\r\nThey are not yet sick.  They are not yet infectious.   We\r\n\r\nmust  educate them and we must keep in constant touch  so\r\n\r\nthat the moment they are infectious, the moment they  are\r\n\r\nunwell,  we will pull them out to Tan Tock Seng  Hospital\r\n\r\nto  be  screened, to be kept under observation and to  be\r\n\r\nisolated.   That  is  a  sensible  balance,  instead   of\r\n\r\nquarantining everybody, because sometimes we all want  to\r\n\r\nbe  extra kiasu.  But we must also be careful that if  we\r\n\r\nbecome  too  kiasu, the whole society will be  paralysed.\r\n\r\nSo we need to strike a balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there were some suggestions about a quarantine\r\n\r\nisland.   That  is not necessary because  these  are  not\r\n\r\npeople  with  leprosy that you need  to  put  them  in  a\r\n\r\nquarantine  island.  They are not sick.  They  are  well.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  they work with us, there is no reason  why  they\r\n\r\ncannot  stay  in their home.  They will not infect  their\r\n\r\nfamily  members  if they follow the precautions  that  we\r\n\r\ntell  them - they keep in constant communication with  us\r\n\r\nand  they  come  forward to Tan Tock Seng for  screening,\r\n\r\nobservation and treatment, if they indeed come down  with\r\n\r\nSARS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area which I want to address is the\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  a  fever station  or  fever  centre,  put\r\n\r\nforward by Dr Tan Cheng Bock and Mr Steve Chia.   I  have\r\n\r\nresponded  that  this is a suggestion worth  considering.\r\n\r\nBut I must say that it cannot be something that is run by\r\n\r\nour    polyclinics   or   hospitals.    Because,    quite\r\n\r\nrealistically, our polyclinics today only provide 20%  of\r\n\r\nthe market share for primary care and we have only 12  to\r\n\r\n<br><br>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOs  in  each polyclinic and they look after  chronic\r\n\r\ncare  as  well  as acute care.  If we run  such  a  fever\r\n\r\ncentre, then I would need to call upon the private sector\r\n\r\nGPs  to  volunteer and to come forward and serve, because\r\n\r\nthe private sector caters for 80% of the market share and\r\n\r\nhaving  fever and acute care is very much the daily  kind\r\n\r\nof  cases  which they see.  But the Government will  work\r\n\r\nwith  them and provide the facilities, space and support.\r\n\r\nBut  for the doctors and nurses, we would like to see how\r\n\r\nwe can work with the private sector so that they can come\r\n\r\nforward and serve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other area which I thought is worth my while to\r\n\r\ngo  through in some detail is the provision that  we  are\r\n\r\nputting in for post-mortem, for extra precautions in  the\r\n\r\ndisposal  of the deceased and in the prohibition  of  the\r\n\r\nwake.  This is a dilemma facing the medical professionals\r\n\r\nand  the Ministry.  We have cases where a person does not\r\n\r\ngo  through the whole progression of the disease.   If  a\r\n\r\nperson comes to us and starts off with being suspected of\r\n\r\nSARS,  the  chest X-ray shows, and he becomes a  probable\r\n\r\nSARS  case, he goes to ICU and if he dies, then it  is  a\r\n\r\nclear-cut case that this is a SARS case.  Then all\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe measures would be taken.  But, unfortunately, at this\r\n\r\nstage  when we do not have a diagnostic method  that  can\r\n\r\ngive  us  quick  and reliable results, we  have  quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of cases that fall in the grey area.  People  who\r\n\r\ncome  to  us very, very sick with no contact history,  or\r\n\r\nlittle  contact  history, the  doctors  have  to  make  a\r\n\r\njudgement whether in fact this is a SARS case or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to illustrate the example of the lady who died\r\n\r\nin  one  of  the  cases  in the Pasir  Panjang  Wholesale\r\n\r\nCentre.   The  lady  from  the family  of  eight  is  the\r\n\r\ngrandmother.  She fell ill, she remained at home and  she\r\n\r\ndied  at  home.  The family had a wake.  Then the  family\r\n\r\nwent  to  see the GP on Saturday and the funeral  service\r\n\r\nwas  on Sunday.  During the period when she died and  the\r\n\r\nperiod  by  which  we  can  confirm  that,  through   our\r\n\r\ndiagnostic  method, she was tested positive  through  the\r\n\r\nPCR test, and that took us six or seven days.  What do we\r\n\r\ndo  during these six or seven days?  This is why we  need\r\n\r\nthis  amendment in the Bill to cater for such situations.\r\n\r\nIn that case, we had no reason to believe that she was  a\r\n\r\nsuspect  SARS  case  because the  cluster  of  the  Pasir\r\n\r\nPanjang Wholesale Centre cases only appeared on Saturday.\r\n\r\nBy  which  time, the family had already had the wake  and\r\n\r\nthe funeral service was on the next day.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with this amendment to the Act, if we are faced\r\n\r\nwith  such  cases, or if we think that there  is  a  high\r\n\r\nsuspicion  that the death could be due to SARS,  then  of\r\n\r\ncourse  we can get the family to cooperate with us,  with\r\n\r\nthe backing of the law, to treat it like a SARS case,  in\r\n\r\nwhich case the body would be double bagged and put  in  a\r\n\r\ncasket,  sealed  with  silicone and cremated  immediately\r\n\r\nwithin  24  hours.  And that is safe for the  family  and\r\n\r\nsafe for the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members asked why so many bags and you cannot\r\n\r\nsee  the  face.  We understand the stress to the  family.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is something that we hope everybody will  bear\r\n\r\nwith  us.  In such a situation, the risk is not  just  to\r\n\r\nthe  people  handling the body and the immediate  family,\r\n\r\nthe risk is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  to the visitors who come to the wake.  Because  the\r\n\r\nvisitors  who  come  to the wake did not  know  that  the\r\n\r\nfamily  could be infected and they are putting themselves\r\n\r\nat  risk.  If the family does not inform them, people who\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  wake out of goodwill and friendship  could\r\n\r\ninadvertently be infected.  So I think Singaporeans  need\r\n\r\nto  work out a new social norm or social behaviour.  That\r\n\r\nis the reason why I met with a group of religious leaders\r\n\r\nto  find ways in which we can still respect the dead  and\r\n\r\nthe  wishes of the family, but still find a sensible  way\r\n\r\nto  organise  the  wake.   One suggestion  offered  by  a\r\n\r\nreligious  group  was that the family can  have  a  small\r\n\r\nfuneral  service limited to just the family members,  and\r\n\r\nall  friends and well wishers can then attend a  memorial\r\n\r\nservice  later on.  This particular religious  group  has\r\n\r\nsuggested  21 (3x7) days later, which is way  beyond  the\r\n\r\nincubation period and therefore it would be clear whether\r\n\r\nor not the family is infected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that is a sensible way to reorganise, or\r\n\r\nreadjust,  our lives knowing that SARS is  with  us.   On\r\n\r\nthis  issue  of  disposal of the body and prohibition  of\r\n\r\nwake, I would like to assure Members that we will take in\r\n\r\nall   the   comments  and  we  will  handle   this   very\r\n\r\nsensitively.  But, at the back of our mind, public health\r\n\r\nis  paramount  and we will always err on the conservative\r\n\r\nside.   But  in doing so, we will make sure that  we  are\r\n\r\nsensitive  to the needs of the family and their religious\r\n\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are the key points I would like to\r\n\r\nemphasise.   I  am  sorry I cannot  go  through  all  the\r\n\r\ndetails.    We   will  deal  with  Members'   suggestions\r\n\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I seek clarification on the\r\n\r\nstatement  made  by Dr Balaji earlier on public  hospital\r\n\r\ndoctors who have recovered from SARS taking throat  swabs\r\n\r\nfor patients suffering from SARS?  May I ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether we may have the same disease pattern, as reported\r\n\r\nin  Hong  Kong,  that  they had been resistant  cases  to\r\n\r\nprevious  treatment in Hong Kong suggesting maybe  a  new\r\n\r\nmutated  virus?  Do we have the same problem in Singapore\r\n\r\nand should we be cautious, rather than presuming that all\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecovered   healthcare  workers  are  now   immune   with\r\n\r\nantibodies to the same virus?  Before we go to the  Third\r\n\r\nReading,  could  the  Minister just  clarify  on  section\r\n\r\n21A(1) and (2) on the word \"contact\" and the other one on\r\n\r\n\"having the care\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am sure Dr Balaji did not\r\n\r\nintend   to  give  the  wrong  impression.   When   these\r\n\r\nrecovered doctors go back to serve and work, they will be\r\n\r\nfully  protected.  If they do procedures,  they  will  be\r\n\r\nhooded  and  they  will have all the protection.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink they volunteer for this job because, theoretically,\r\n\r\nthey  should have higher immunity than somebody  who  has\r\n\r\nnot.   So  it is a recognition of their sense of  service\r\n\r\nthat  between  two  doctors, the one  who  has  recovered\r\n\r\nprobably  or  theoretically should have  higher  immunity\r\n\r\nthan somebody who has not gone through the disease.   All\r\n\r\nsaid  and  done, they would be fully protected  and  they\r\n\r\nwould do it with due care.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether we are seeing a mutated form, there\r\n\r\nare  still a lot of e-mails running around among all  the\r\n\r\nvarious laboratories and various centres.  I do not think\r\n\r\nthe issue has been settled.  The coronavirus is known  to\r\n\r\nhave this habit of mutating.  But, at the same time, many\r\n\r\nlaboratories find that the samples which they  have  been\r\n\r\nusing are fairly stable.  If indeed we have a virus  that\r\n\r\nmutates so rapidly, then that would be a setback  to  us.\r\n\r\nBecause  your diagnostic test methods would also have  to\r\n\r\nchange  in  keeping  with  the  mutation.   So  far,  the\r\n\r\nlaboratories  around  the  world  are  working  on  these\r\n\r\nsamples.   I  think  our main task  now  is  to  get  the\r\n\r\nreliability  of  these samples and get a high  turnaround\r\n\r\nrate  first.  This issue of mutation has not been  proven\r\n\r\none way or the other.  So we have to keep an open mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the definition of the two points, we have to make\r\n\r\nan assessment.  A \"contact\" means somebody that has close\r\n\r\nenough  contact  that  can cause the  infection  to  take\r\n\r\nplace.  So in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCentre's  case, our contact tracing teams could not  make\r\n\r\nan  assessment.  And that is the reason we were forced to\r\n\r\nclose  the  whole  centre down.  But if Singaporeans  and\r\n\r\ncompanies  can  work out a system in  which  contacts  or\r\n\r\ninteractions  are recorded or limited, then  whenever  we\r\n\r\nencounter  a  case,  we do not have  to  shut  the  whole\r\n\r\ncompany or system down.  We will just look for the  group\r\n\r\nthat has close contact with the affected people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other definition is about the person \"having the\r\n\r\ncare\".   According to AG's Chambers, what they  meant  is\r\n\r\nany person who is responsible for the care of others, and\r\n\r\nthis  largely refers to parents and guardians.   It  will\r\n\r\nnot   refer  to  other  caregivers,  doctors   or   other\r\n\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Could I have the Minister's\r\n\r\nclarification again that Tan Tock Seng Hospital's medical\r\n\r\nstaff  are  not  meant to be the contact of  the  disease\r\n\r\nunder  section 21A(1), because it says anybody  that  has\r\n\r\n\"contact of a disease\".  This is because, if we follow it\r\n\r\nclosely,  then Tan Tock Seng Hospital staff  are  in  the\r\n\r\ndefinition.
