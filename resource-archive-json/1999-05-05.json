The  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  and the Land Transport Authority already have  plans  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  months  to  facilitate the  early  towing  away  of\r\n\r\nbreakdown  vehicles on expressways, as well as  to  control  the\r\n\r\nspeed of heavy vehicles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LTA introduced an Expressway Monitoring and Advisory\r\n\r\nSystem  (EMAS)  for the Central Expressway (CTE)  on  1st  March\r\n\r\n1998.   EMAS  spots accidents and breakdown vehicles  which  are\r\n\r\nthen  removed by LTA's towing contractor.  The quick removal  of\r\n\r\nobstruction ensures that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  source  of danger is removed as soon as possible  and  also\r\n\r\nminimises  delays to other motorists.  EMAS will  eventually  be\r\n\r\nextended to the other expressways, like the BKE, PIE and ECP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police is also working with LTA and transport\r\n\r\nassociations  such  as  the Motor Traders  Association  and  the\r\n\r\nFreight  Forwarders  Association to look  into  requiring  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles  to  install  speed  limiters.   These  limiters  would\r\n\r\nrestrict the speed at which heavy vehicles can travel.  Once the\r\n\r\nvehicle  reaches  a  certain pre-determined maximum  speed,  the\r\n\r\npetrol-supply to the engine would be regulated, and the  vehicle\r\n\r\nwould  not be able to travel beyond that speed.   Such  limiters\r\n\r\nare  already  in  place in almost all SBS and TIBS  buses.   The\r\n\r\nfirst phase of implementation is expected to start in July  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides taking preventive measures, the Traffic Police will\r\n\r\nalso  step  up  its  enforcement against  heavy  vehicles.   The\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  has  been charging drivers  of  heavy  vehicles\r\n\r\ninvolved  in  serious and fatal accidents and,  on  a  selective\r\n\r\nbasis,  slight injury accidents.  Henceforth, the Traffic Police\r\n\r\nwill  charge  all drivers of heavy vehicles who are involved  in\r\n\r\naccidents in court.  The Traffic Police will also charge drivers\r\n\r\nof  heavy vehicles who are caught speeding.  Errant drivers will\r\n\r\nbe liable for heavier penalties as well as disqualification from\r\n\r\ndriving.  For careless driving, a first offender will be  liable\r\n\r\nto  a  fine  of $1,000 or 3 months imprisonment.  For  dangerous\r\n\r\ndriving,  the offender will be liable to a fine of up to  $3,000\r\n\r\nor  12  months imprisonment or both.  The offender can  also  be\r\n\r\nliable to disqualification from driving.  In suitable cases, the\r\n\r\nTraffic  Police  will press for a deterrent sentence,  including\r\n\r\nimprisonment sentences and disqualification from driving.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Traffic Police takes a serious view of motorists\r\n\r\nwho  blatantly  flout traffic regulations, such  as  driving  on\r\n\r\nexpressway shoulders.  Expressway shoulders are meant  only  for\r\n\r\nvehicles to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstop temporarily during emergencies, for example, when a vehicle\r\n\r\nbreaks down.  Motorists should not treat a road shoulder  as  an\r\n\r\nadditional  carriageway.  Anyone who drives  on  the  expressway\r\n\r\nshoulder  can  be  fined up to $1,000 or 3 months  imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe  offender  will also be given 4 demerit  points.   A  repeat\r\n\r\noffender can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed up to 6 months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Traffic Police is currently reviewing the demerit\r\n\r\npoints  system.   The  review  will include  all  offences  that\r\n\r\ncurrently   attract  demerit  points,  such  as  driving   along\r\n\r\nexpressway shoulders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Traffic Police would also like to advise motorist whose\r\n\r\nvehicle  has broken down along the expressway to switch  on  the\r\n\r\nhazard  lights  and  display the vehicle  breakdown  sign.   The\r\n\r\nmotorist  and his passengers should move away from the breakdown\r\n\r\nvehicle and stand behind the guard rail.   They should face  the\r\n\r\ndirection  of  the  on-coming traffic and not venture  onto  the\r\n\r\ncarriageway at all times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, when can we\r\n\r\nexpect  the full implementation of the speed limiters for  heavy\r\n\r\nvehicles?  Also, what sort of heavier penalties could we  expect\r\n\r\nfor  drivers  who violate these laws?

Readers  of\r\n\r\nnewspapers would have noted that the newspapers ran a series  of\r\n\r\narticles  carrying  views from residents,  motorists  and  other\r\n\r\npeople  who complained about illegal parking and they  want  the\r\n\r\nPolice to do more in dealing with this problem.  As a result and\r\n\r\nin  response  to  this   -  the Traffic  Police  has  also  been\r\n\r\nconsidering  this   -   the  Police has therefore  demarcated  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of areas to attract demerit points if motorists park  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas.   And the number of such zones which will  attract\r\n\r\ndemerit  points  for illegal parking will increase  to  quite  a\r\n\r\nsignificant number.

Definitions  regarding  the\r\n\r\nquality  and  fixtures are very difficult to pin down.   In  the\r\n\r\nofficial  submissions of developments, URA uses the term  \"gross\r\n\r\nfloor area (GFA)\".  That does not convey the same meaning to the\r\n\r\npurchaser.   It  is  more technical.  So  some  developers  have\r\n\r\ntended  to  use  more market friendly terms, like \"built-in\"  or\r\n\r\n\"built-up\".   Therefore,  we think we should  leave  it  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket to try and define these terms so that the properties  can\r\n\r\nbe  marketed  in  as unambiguous a manner as possible.   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  were to step in, then the Government is more  likely\r\n\r\nto  use  the  more technical terms which have been  established,\r\n\r\nlike GFA.

Back  in 1997, when the Prime Minister first  launched\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  21  Committee to look  into  the  five  apparent\r\n\r\ndilemmas,  my  intuitive  reaction was that  the  Committee  was\r\n\r\nendeavouring  into areas which are philosophical in  nature  and\r\n\r\nvery broad in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscope.  Many lay people may find it difficult to understand  and\r\n\r\nappreciate.   And  I personally have expected the  five  subject\r\n\r\ncommittees to come up with five different reports after  holding\r\n\r\nseparate meetings, forums, interviews and surveys.  But  I  must\r\n\r\nsay  that I was pleasantly surprised to receive the final report\r\n\r\nin  a  form  that  integrates the derived  wisdom  of  the  five\r\n\r\ndilemmas  and  successfully  translate  them  into  five  easily\r\n\r\nunderstood headings and expressed in such an easy language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report, without being dry and stuffy, tells a story to\r\n\r\nour  Singaporeans, like what the parents do to  their  children,\r\n\r\nhow  as  a  united  people we can strive towards  achieving  our\r\n\r\ndreams   while  strengthening  the  social  cohesion,  political\r\n\r\nstability and the collective will, values and attitudes  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important story. Like any well-run corporation,\r\n\r\na  country needs a mission statement, a vision, so that  it  can\r\n\r\ngalvanise  its  people's  energy to constructively  achieve  its\r\n\r\ngoals.  The S21 report, in my opinion, is the mission statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly speaking, the contents of the S21 report, although\r\n\r\ninitiated  by the Government, do not suggest that it comes  from\r\n\r\nthe  Government alone.  The 6,000 people involved over the 1 1/2\r\n\r\nyears have contributed to create a dream state, an utopia  in  a\r\n\r\nmodern  form  for Singapore.  If we achieve it, we would  likely\r\n\r\nhave   a   socially  and  economically  advanced  nation   where\r\n\r\nindividuals, whether local or foreign, will be pursuing goals in\r\n\r\nlife  without  undue stress.  The families and  communities  are\r\n\r\nclosely-knit  together to provide a strong emotional  and  moral\r\n\r\nplatform.   The  people in the private and public  sectors  will\r\n\r\nwork and support one another as if they are merged together.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Minister stated yesterday, we do not know how long it  will\r\n\r\ntake.   But until this happens, we will continue to hear  people\r\n\r\nlamenting that life in Singapore is too stressful.  People still\r\n\r\ncannot get away from their stereotype aims - the 5Cs.  And  very\r\n\r\nfew would aspire to become artists,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmusicians,  sportsmen, or even entrepreneurs  because  there  is\r\n\r\neither no money in these professions or too much risks in them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, everybody will be chasing after higher\r\n\r\npaying  jobs,  speculating in shares and properties,  like  what\r\n\r\nthey  have been doing in the last two days.  And many have taken\r\n\r\nfor  granted  that  life is a rose garden.  Then  suddenly,  two\r\n\r\nyears  ago,  the Asian financial crisis hit us.  Things  changed\r\n\r\ndrastically.   It  makes  many to rethink  about  the  value  of\r\n\r\nkeeping a job, about getting help from the family and community,\r\n\r\nabout  what  businesses we should be in and  how  Singapore  can\r\n\r\nsurvive  and prosper in the face of new challenges in this  fast\r\n\r\nchanging world.  The timing to have this S21 Committee to  study\r\n\r\nthe dilemmas cannot be more perfect.  The crisis environment has\r\n\r\nmade  everyone dig deeper into their soul to reflect and  search\r\n\r\nfor solution.  The impact of this report will be far less, if it\r\n\r\nwere presented in better economic times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good part of this report is devoted to the strengthening\r\n\r\nof   family   ties  and  community  bonding.   When  one   faces\r\n\r\ndifficulties in terms of employment and business operation,  all\r\n\r\nthese become apparent and important.  I can guess now that  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have realised Singapore's ability to sail  through\r\n\r\nthis  crisis better than others because we could act as a people\r\n\r\nto resolve difficult problems.  We could cut CPF and pay, reduce\r\n\r\ntaxes  and fees.  We have built up a strong foundation in family\r\n\r\nties,  community bonding and a strong reserve with  good  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicies that we now have time and energy to utilise this window\r\n\r\nof  opportunities to launch a new direction and platform to move\r\n\r\nto the next level of prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many westerners have argued that the Asian culture tends to\r\n\r\nbe  too selfish and too family-oriented.  It only takes care  of\r\n\r\nthe  interest  of  the family members and ignores  the  societal\r\n\r\nissues  evolving around them.  Well, Singapore has  proved  them\r\n\r\nwrong.   By  adhering to our culture of having  strong  extended\r\n\r\nfamilies with Government policies constantly calling for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  reinforcing  these values, our society is  relatively  more\r\n\r\npeaceful,  self-enhancing and supportive.  Asians tend  to  care\r\n\r\nfor  their  elders  more  partly  because  of  the  culture   of\r\n\r\nrespecting  the elders, and also because they realise  how  much\r\n\r\nthe  elders  have sacrificed to provide shelter, good  education\r\n\r\nand  opportunities  to the younger ones.  The  desire  to  bring\r\n\r\nhonour to their family also provides the impetus to compete  and\r\n\r\nexcel.   These  cultural values, as  can be  easily  seen,  have\r\n\r\ndriven  the Asian economy well.  We are in the middle  of  these\r\n\r\ncultural  settings, and we probably do not feel the merits  just\r\n\r\nas much.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I chanced upon talking to a Singapore lady\r\n\r\nresiding in USA.  She cherished the extended family support  she\r\n\r\nused  to  get, particularly during her confinement period,  that\r\n\r\nis,  within  one  month  after  giving  birth  to  a  baby.   In\r\n\r\nSingapore, many mothers will enjoy the close attention of  their\r\n\r\nfamily  members during the confinement period.  They are  served\r\n\r\nwith  tonics  and special food.  They are given  massages.   And\r\n\r\nmany  do  not even have to leave the house for the whole  month.\r\n\r\nIn  the  USA,  many mothers would have to do all  the  household\r\n\r\nchores  immediately  after being discharged from  the  hospital.\r\n\r\nAnd they all have to bring their barely one-week old baby to the\r\n\r\nsupermarket.   I  wonder how many of our  women  would  like  to\r\n\r\nchoose the American way of life over Singapore's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me speak on the topic of an aging population.\r\n\r\nThere  is no escape that Singapore has one of the fastest  aging\r\n\r\npopulations.    This   is  a  demographic  fact.    Fortunately,\r\n\r\nSingapore has a policy of making everyone to save for his or her\r\n\r\nown  old age.  The savings through the CPF scheme will make  our\r\n\r\nold  age relatively comfortable.  But I wish to share with  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that,  according  to the latest  studies  by  scientists,\r\n\r\nmodern  science would prolong our lives substantially.  Many  of\r\n\r\nus  may have the chance to live up to the 80s, 90s, or even 100.\r\n\r\nIf  we retire at 55 or 60 years old, we would have many years to\r\n\r\nenjoy  if  we have sufficient savings, or we will suffer  if  we\r\n\r\nhave  not  enough  savings.  Hence, we  should  all  expect  the\r\n\r\npattern of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlife  to  change.  The  retirement age will  be  pushed  further\r\n\r\nbecause  of  relatively good health.  But for one to  be  useful\r\n\r\nbeyond 55 or 60 years old, we have to train and re-train several\r\n\r\ntimes  over.   Therefore,  I support the  concept  of  life-long\r\n\r\nlearning, as suggested in the report and I strongly endorse that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of all ages must be given opportunities to  upgrade\r\n\r\nand to renew their knowledge and skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, most of our forefathers came to Singapore\r\n\r\nin  search  of  opportunities.  They were pushed  out  of  their\r\n\r\nhomeland  for  one reason or another.  They also  brought  along\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  and talents.  Through hard work and thrift,  many\r\n\r\nmanaged to seize the opportunities and they prospered.  Now, the\r\n\r\nstage   is  different.   Our  people  face  a  lot  of  external\r\n\r\ncompetition because of globalisation.  Hard work and thrift  are\r\n\r\nnecessary but they are not sufficient to succeed.  We need  more\r\n\r\neducation,  more  ideas to create more opportunities,  and  more\r\n\r\nsynergies  to create wealth.  Hence, we need the foreign  talent\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a small population, Singapore cannot generate enough\r\n\r\ntalents to achieve the economies of scale.  We need talents, and\r\n\r\nwe  need  them badly.  Everyone knows USA is a world  leader  in\r\n\r\ntechnology.  But if USA had not opened its doors to talents from\r\n\r\nGermany,  Russia and Asia, it may not do as well as it is  doing\r\n\r\nnow.   However,  America has now reached a stage  where  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome the world's most powerful magnet, attracting talents from\r\n\r\nall  over  the  world  with  the possibility  of  fulfilling  an\r\n\r\nunlimited  dream.   And that is the American  heartbeat  to  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while we talk about attracting foreign talents,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  ensure that our own talents will not be  attracted\r\n\r\naway  and  eventually abandon us.  There is no  denial  that  we\r\n\r\nexpect   our  local  and  foreign  talents  to  shuttle  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and a country like USA.  To make them feel attached to\r\n\r\nSingapore and continue to contribute to Singapore will be  quite\r\n\r\na tall order.  Not only do we need to let these talents feel the\r\n\r\nSingapore  heartbeat,  we may have to  make  our  own  heartbeat\r\n\r\nlouder than others.  That leads me to argue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat we have to change some of the social order here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore 21 Report calls for opportunities for all and\r\n\r\nfor  the  more successful to help the less successful.  On  this\r\n\r\npoint,  in my opinion, we have a long way to go.  There  are,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  some  emotional and moral issues we have not  addressed,\r\n\r\nthat  is,  the way people are treated.  The people  will  always\r\n\r\nfeel attached if they are treated fairly and with compassion. It\r\n\r\nis  difficult to cultivate loyalty if the relationships are  not\r\n\r\nfair.    The   relationships  here  may  refer  to   contractual\r\n\r\nrelationships between big companies and small companies, between\r\n\r\nbanks  and their customers, between the employers and employees,\r\n\r\netc.  In numerous instances, there exists a situation of the big\r\n\r\nbullying  the small, and the powerful bullying the weak.   There\r\n\r\nare  hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans out there who do  not\r\n\r\nhave  much  education and they do not know very well  about  the\r\n\r\nlegal  aspects.  But they still need to enter into contracts  if\r\n\r\nthey  want  to  make a living.  With contracts written  in  fine\r\n\r\nprints  and  biased terms, their lives can be  crippled  easily.\r\n\r\nEven  for  those who can read, the situation is not much  better\r\n\r\nbecause  the big boys will always draft such contracts that  the\r\n\r\nrisks  and rewards are not appropriately distributed.   The  law\r\n\r\nand  order  situation in Singapore has, in some ways, given  the\r\n\r\nadvantage to the big boys.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attain the goal of making every Singaporean counts and\r\n\r\nopportunities  for all, we as a people should strive  towards  a\r\n\r\nfair and just society, which will in turn bring out the best  of\r\n\r\neach person.  To this end, I am glad that Singapore has moved in\r\n\r\nthe right direction.  It adopted the UK's Fair Contract Term Act\r\n\r\n1977 to protect the consumers.  If we can implement this concept\r\n\r\nmore  pervasively  and extend to all aspects  of  life,  we  may\r\n\r\nbecome  one of the fairest and most just societies in the world.\r\n\r\nThis  will add a lot to the reputation of Singapore as a  global\r\n\r\ncentre and will enhance our heartbeat substantially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another matter related to fairness, I think the\r\n\r\nrelatively high percentage of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  surveyed  who  feel that they are second-class  citizens\r\n\r\ncould  be a true reflection of the real feelings of our  people.\r\n\r\nThey  probably  harbour such feelings even  before  the  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent  policy was introduced.  Manifested in various  forms  in\r\n\r\nthe  past,  our  society is often said to be pro-foreign.   Many\r\n\r\ncontracts  go  to foreigners.  Sometimes, foreign  products  and\r\n\r\nservices are preferred to the local ones at a higher cost.   So,\r\n\r\nwhen it comes to jobs, the natural mindset is that they will  go\r\n\r\nto  the foreigners too.  Yes, many locals might not have been as\r\n\r\ngood  as  the foreigners.  Many foreign companies are bigger  in\r\n\r\nsize  or older than our whole nation.  Naturally, they will have\r\n\r\nthe  products  and  services to beat us.   If  we  do  not  give\r\n\r\nopportunities to the locals, then effectively, we have no  self-pride that we can do equally well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope the Government will remove the \"Buy IBM\"\r\n\r\nmentality  to allay the fear that Singaporeans have for  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent.   The \"Buy IBM\" mentality refers to the situation  where\r\n\r\nthe  data processing managers would always choose big names like\r\n\r\nIBM  because it is well-known.  If something goes wrong,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  the  fault  of the manager.  This mentality has  helped  to\r\n\r\nbuild  up  risk-aversion and it permeates throughout  the  whole\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with unfair terms of contracts, as mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier, the whole process has created a \"Head, I win, tail, you\r\n\r\nlose\"  situation.   In a society laden with these  shortcomings,\r\n\r\nyou  can  expect  the  social and economic  costs  to  be  high.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  strongly support the Singapore 21  recommendation\r\n\r\nthat  we should overcome our kiasu attitude and give everyone  a\r\n\r\nfair chance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the topic of active citizens, I wish to relate one\r\n\r\nincident  I  encountered  recently.   A  very  prominent   local\r\n\r\nbusinessman discussed with me about the experience of  being  an\r\n\r\nNMP.   In  his  opinion, being an NMP could be a burden  to  the\r\n\r\nconduct of business because NMPs could offend the civil servants\r\n\r\nin  the  course  of parliamentary debates. I  do  not  think  so\r\n\r\npersonally and, so far, it does not seem to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  so.   I  think the civil service is mature enough to  accept\r\n\r\nconstructive   criticisms.    They   are   able   to   make    a\r\n\r\ndifferentiation  between  official and  personal  business.   In\r\n\r\nChinese, we call it dui shi bu dui ren.  The Singapore 21 report\r\n\r\nalso  aptly says, \"There should be no loss of face by the public\r\n\r\nsector  if  good ideas come from the people.\"  As  a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact,   I  am  quite  satisfied  with  the  response  from   the\r\n\r\npoliticians and the civil servants to the issues I have  brought\r\n\r\nup and debated in this House so far.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, based on my experience as an NMP, I do not hesitate\r\n\r\nto  echo  the  call  of the S21 Committee  to  get  more  active\r\n\r\ncitizens to participate in the civic life of Singapore so as  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  dynamic  people sector to complement  the  private  and\r\n\r\npublic sectors.  Today, there may not be enough Singaporeans who\r\n\r\ncan be classified as active citizens.  With clearer OB lines and\r\n\r\nencouragement, I am sure more and more Singaporeans will realise\r\n\r\nthat they have a stake in our nation and by getting involved and\r\n\r\nmaking their contributions, they can make the nation prosper and\r\n\r\nthey will be the ones who have it all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to request the Minister to look into\r\n\r\nproducing  the report in other languages with equal quality  and\r\n\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Community  Development  (Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen)  (In\r\n\r\nMandarin):  Sir, I strongly agree and fully support  the  motion\r\n\r\nstanding  in  the  name  of  the Minister  for  Education.  This\r\n\r\nSingapore 21 Vision has already been set out very clearly in the\r\n\r\nbook  and I do not wish to waste the precious time of this House\r\n\r\nto deal with the materials in this book itself.  I would like to\r\n\r\njust raise a point of emphasis and a point of reminder.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a point of emphasis: If we want to achieve the S21\r\n\r\nvision, we must ask what we can do for S21 and not what S21  can\r\n\r\ndo  for us.  In other words, we must be pro-active.  We must ask\r\n\r\nourselves what we must do to achieve Vision 21 and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould not confine ourselves to just wishing the realisation  of\r\n\r\nS21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people commented that the five ideas in the S21 Vision\r\n\r\nwere  obvious and there was no need to take such a long time  of\r\n\r\none  and  a  half years and involve over 6,000 people  and  many\r\n\r\nworking hours to churn out these apparently obvious proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days ago, I met a friend who said that the time that\r\n\r\nthe   Committee  and  the  6,000  Singaporeans  had  spent,   if\r\n\r\ncalculated  in terms of dollars and cents, would be  a  gigantic\r\n\r\nsum.   But  I  feel  that the people who advance  this  kind  of\r\n\r\nargument just do not understand.  Yes, if we only talk and never\r\n\r\ndo  anything about it, then this argument may be valid.   If  we\r\n\r\ntalk  and  just stop there, it would have been a waste of  time.\r\n\r\nBut  this is only a beginning.  This process of the 1 1/2  years\r\n\r\nof  talk  was to reach a consensus to facilitate future  action.\r\n\r\nWe  do  need  to spend time and energy to obtain this consensus.\r\n\r\nAs  a matter of fact, all the members, including myself, of  the\r\n\r\nS21  Committee and all those Singaporeans who have  participated\r\n\r\nin  these  meetings, unanimously agree that the  S21  Vision  is\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we  must  translate into  action.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we just talk about and forget  about  it.   The\r\n\r\npoint  is:   what  can  we do and what action  can  we  take  to\r\n\r\ntranslate the vision into a reality?  What efforts must we  make\r\n\r\nto  achieve  this?   This is the question  that  we  should  ask\r\n\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, if we want to achieve our vision, we must\r\n\r\npractise  what  we  preach and strive for  positive  results  in\r\n\r\nwhatever we do.  If we do not do anything, if you just doubt the\r\n\r\nsincerity, shun your responsibilities and just indulge in  empty\r\n\r\ntalks, big things you cannot do and small things you do not want\r\n\r\nto do, then we will be losing the golden opportunities available\r\n\r\nto  us.  Therefore, I hope that we will not just sit tight, talk\r\n\r\nand  do nothing.  We should stand up and think about what to do,\r\n\r\nwhat  action  to  take to realise our vision, our  ideal.   That\r\n\r\nbeing  the  case,  let  us  prepare ourselves  to  take  up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge, and put the theories into action.  I think our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresponsibility  can  be summed up in these  words:  \"Be  a  good\r\n\r\nman/woman.   Set  up  a good family.  Serve the  community.   Be\r\n\r\npassionate about the nation.\"  So start with yourself  and  your\r\n\r\nfamily.  Set it right.  Let our children have a good foundation,\r\n\r\na good learning environment and a good model to emulate to build\r\n\r\nup  good character and conduct.  It is only then that we will be\r\n\r\nable  to  reduce social problems correspondingly.  A  knowledge-based economy and good work attitude would then have a chance to\r\n\r\ntake  roots.  If you extrapolate this kind of good conduct, good\r\n\r\ncharacter  to  others, you will have the mood, ability,  passion\r\n\r\nand  heartware  to  think  about how  to  look  after  the  less\r\n\r\nsuccessful  people in society so that we can build up  a  caring\r\n\r\nand gracious society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that we are young and energetic - but\r\n\r\nfortune  may change.  There may come a day when you  and  I  may\r\n\r\nneed the help of others.  If we can take the necessary action in\r\n\r\nour  early  days to build a gracious society and a society  with\r\n\r\ncare  and compassion, then with this kind of ethos in place,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be easier for us to get help.  Also, since we have already\r\n\r\ngiven,  when  we  want  to take something in  the  give-and-take\r\n\r\nspirit,  we  will  be  able  to  take  without  having  to  feel\r\n\r\nembarrassed.   So, you have a sense of security, it  is  a  good\r\n\r\nhome  that we want to build.  The family, of course,  is  a  key\r\n\r\ncornerstone  of  society.   This  is  undoubtedly  so.   In  the\r\n\r\nConfucian teaching, the five relationships, ie, the King and the\r\n\r\nsubjects,  the  parents  and  children,  brothers  and  sisters,\r\n\r\nhusband and wife, and friends, three of these five relationships\r\n\r\ninvolve the family.  Our Malay and Indian compatriots also  have\r\n\r\nsimilar emphasis on the family.  In fact, I note that the  Malay\r\n\r\nand Indian friends are even stronger in their family cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being so, there is no need for me to emphasise more on\r\n\r\nthe  importance of the family.  However, I wish to point out the\r\n\r\npotential of the concept of Tri-generation Network in  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   At the present moment, it is not easy to  have  three\r\n\r\ngenerations under one roof.  The success\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  our  home ownership scheme has enabled our young  people  to\r\n\r\nbuild  their own families once they get married.  However,  even\r\n\r\nif  the  three  generations  do  not  stay  together,  the  Tri-generation Network should still be maintained.  The Network  has\r\n\r\ngreat  potential  and  importance in our  society  in  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Mr Peh Chin Hua also referred to this point. In\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century, we would have this \"sandwiched  generation\",\r\n\r\nwhose  ages are in the 30s and 40s.  They have, on the one hand,\r\n\r\nto  be  filial to their parents and, on the other hand, to bring\r\n\r\nup  their  children,  while  simultaneously  building  up  their\r\n\r\nbusiness   and  career.  These  people  are  facing   tremendous\r\n\r\npressure.   Without  proper support, I  think  this  \"sandwiched\r\n\r\ngeneration\" would become a \"besieged generation\".   But  if  the\r\n\r\ngrandparents can chip in to take the role of looking after their\r\n\r\ngrandchildren,  then  the pressure of the sandwiched  generation\r\n\r\ncan  be  alleviated.   At the same time, we have  tri-generation\r\n\r\ncooperation  -  grandparents help look after the  grandchildren,\r\n\r\nthus  playing  a  key role which help gain the  appreciation  of\r\n\r\ntheir children in the \"sandwiched generation\".  If we have  this\r\n\r\nkind  of strong three-generation ties, then family cohesion  can\r\n\r\nbe strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 years from now, when I am in my 70s, with Tri-generation\r\n\r\nNetwork,  I  would command better respect as an old man  in  the\r\n\r\nfamily.   If I just sit down at home and do nothing, I think  my\r\n\r\nchildren will not respect me.  They would then not be filial  to\r\n\r\nme.   I  feel  that in the 21st century, we must  reiterate  the\r\n\r\nimportant  status  of the grandparents.  In this  connection,  I\r\n\r\nhave suggested to the Ministry of Community Development and  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Association that we should promote  Grandparents'  Day\r\n\r\ncelebration to more grassroots organisations during this  year's\r\n\r\nSenior  Citizens Week.  We have Father's Day and  Mother's  Day.\r\n\r\nWhy  can  we not have a Grandparents' Day?  Mr Loh Meng See  did\r\n\r\nthis  in  his community centre last year.  I think  this  is  an\r\n\r\nexcellent  idea.   We  should extend this Grandparents'  Day  to\r\n\r\nother  grassroots  organisations.   Once  Grandparents'  Day  is\r\n\r\nestablished, more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  will  better appreciate the importance of  grandparents,\r\n\r\nand the grandparents in the 21st century will be able to play  a\r\n\r\ngreater  role  and get greater respect from their  children  and\r\n\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we can all play our roles and do what I have just set\r\n\r\nout  earlier,  I  believe we will be able to move  forward  with\r\n\r\npeace of mind, with the knowledge that whenever we encounter any\r\n\r\nsetbacks,  we  will be able to fall back on our gracious  social\r\n\r\nenvironment, whether at home or in society, to take a break  and\r\n\r\nrecover from the setbacks.  We will then be able to make a  come\r\n\r\nback  from  our setback, create another tomorrow, and  become  a\r\n\r\ngreat  hero again.  If we can do this, we will be able to attack\r\n\r\nas  we  advance and defend as we retreat.  This will be of great\r\n\r\nhelp  and  it  will  give us great confidence in  realising  our\r\n\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concerns raised by Mr Chuang Shaw Peng can also be\r\n\r\nsolved.  Since we are confident we can attack as we advance  and\r\n\r\ndefend as we retreat, we will have greater confidence and lesser\r\n\r\nworries.   We will not worry unnecessarily and will  not  be  so\r\n\r\nkiasu.   We  will have greater spirit of enterprise and  broader\r\n\r\nvision.  We will be more prepared and able to realise the vision\r\n\r\nof S21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a reminder. We must always remember that we are a\r\n\r\nmulti-racial society.  We must seek strength through  diversity.\r\n\r\nWhy  do  I  want to bring up this diversity and multi-racialism?\r\n\r\nRecent  discussions  about SAP schools, language  policies,  and\r\n\r\nemployment  criteria gave me mixed feelings.  I think  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  point  here  is that all these  talks  and  arguments\r\n\r\nremind  us that if we want to realise the five ideas in the  S21\r\n\r\nvision,  we  must never forget that Singapore is a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nand  multi-cultural society.  This fact is so today and it  will\r\n\r\nremain  so tomorrow.  In the 21st century and even in  the  22nd\r\n\r\ncentury and beyond, it will remain the same - multi-cultural and\r\n\r\nmulti-racial.  Since nation building, we have done a great  deal\r\n\r\nto achieve racial harmony.  Our multi-racial people have already\r\n\r\nbenefitted much from the heritage and wisdom in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.  This is in fact\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1454</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe strong point that we have for nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future years, we must also continue to take advantage of\r\n\r\nthis  heritage. We can all see that the five ideas  in  our  S21\r\n\r\nvision are founded on multi-racialism and multi-culturalism.  We\r\n\r\nmust  continue to strengthen and preserve this heritage.  If  we\r\n\r\ncannot  do so, how can we say that every Singaporean count?   If\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  racial harmony, how can we have a  strong  social\r\n\r\nfoundation?  How are we going to create opportunities  for  all?\r\n\r\nAnd how are we going to have a Singapore heartbeat?  How are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  have active citizens making a difference to  society?\r\n\r\nTherefore, I must reiterate and remind our people that  we  must\r\n\r\nhave  pride  in  our own culture, and we must also  respect  the\r\n\r\ncultures  of  others.   This is the essence  of  a  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety and country.  It is also the cornerstone for our  future\r\n\r\nregionalisation, globalisation and networking strategy.   If  we\r\n\r\ncannot  even handle our own multi-culturalism today, how are  we\r\n\r\ngoing  to  globalise, regionalise and to face more cultures  and\r\n\r\nmore ways of doing things in the world outside?  I think this is\r\n\r\na  very  basic  issue.   This  is not  something  that  we  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered only today.  But it is always the magnanimity that we\r\n\r\nhave seen and observed over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my own personal experience, I would like to throw more\r\n\r\nlight  on  this issue.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I was educated  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  stream in my younger days.  The Chinese school at  that\r\n\r\ntime was different from the present Chinese school.  In  the old\r\n\r\nChinese school, there were no Indian or Malay students.  We were\r\n\r\nall  Chinese speaking and our English was not very good, and  we\r\n\r\ncould  not  even  read the English newspapers properly  at  that\r\n\r\ntime.   In  spite  of all that, at that time, I  had  a  lot  of\r\n\r\nopportunities to read the writings of the writers  and  scholars\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and Malaysia in Chinese.  Through their  works,  I\r\n\r\nwas  able to understand and respect the cultures of other races.\r\n\r\nFor  example, I do not know whether hon. Members of  this  House\r\n\r\nare  aware  that  one  Prof.  Hsu Yun  Chiaw  had  compiled  and\r\n\r\ntranslated the Malay classic Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals.   I\r\n\r\nstill have a copy of the Chinese\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntranslation.  This book tells us about Malay  history  from  Sri\r\n\r\nVijaya to the Malacca Kingdom. Through this book, I was able  to\r\n\r\nunderstand the Malay culture, its progress and advancement.   At\r\n\r\nthat time, we were able to read fables of Sang Kancil, the mouse-deer.  Sang Kancil is very intelligent, very alert, but is  very\r\n\r\nsmall  and will not harm others. Though it is not big enough  to\r\n\r\nattack others, others will find it difficult to bully the mouse-deer  because it is very alert.  So it is able to start up  good\r\n\r\nschemes  to extricate itself from situations and run  away  from\r\n\r\nits predators.  Having read these fables, I think I learnt a lot\r\n\r\nof lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Chinese version, I have also read about the epics\r\n\r\nof  Mahabarata  and the Ramayana.  I do not know  who  were  the\r\n\r\nChinese  writers in Malaysia and Singapore who translated  these\r\n\r\ninto  the  Chinese  language.  In an episode in  Ramayana,  Lord\r\n\r\nRama's wife was abducted by a demon.  In order to save his wife,\r\n\r\nhe  had  to leave his country.   At that time, he was the  King.\r\n\r\nBefore he left his country, he asked his younger brother to look\r\n\r\nafter  the country.  He said that he would return after rescuing\r\n\r\nhis  wife.  His younger brother said, \"I do not have the  wisdom\r\n\r\nand  ability  to rule the country on your behalf.  But  I  know,\r\n\r\nbrother, this is something that you must do.  So I will just  do\r\n\r\nmy  best.  I will sit beside your throne and put your sandals on\r\n\r\nthe  throne.   You remain the person who is ruling the  country.\r\n\r\nI  am  only  your agent, your servant, acting on  your  behalf.\"\r\n\r\nThat is what the younger brother said to Ramayana. You must have\r\n\r\nrespect  for  the elders, you must have shame, you must  have  a\r\n\r\nsense of right and wrong.  So this is a story that portrays  all\r\n\r\nthese values.  It is a very useful and meaningful lesson for  us\r\n\r\nto  learn.  When you do not have the legitimacy, you cannot have\r\n\r\nthe moral ground, and you cannot succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading these, one realises the many parallels between the\r\n\r\ncultures and teachings of our ethnic communities.  Being in  SAP\r\n\r\nschools will not stop students from learning about the Malay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1456</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Indian cultures if there is a will to learn.  We must  know\r\n\r\nmore about one another and we must strengthen our solidarity and\r\n\r\nthrough different ways and means, we must promulgate the  values\r\n\r\nwhich  are  common in all of us, so that we will  not  lose  our\r\n\r\ndirection in future.  When I was young, the influence that I had\r\n\r\nwas  very useful to me when I grew up.  When I was older, I went\r\n\r\noverseas,  I  met foreign friends.  Because I have always  lived\r\n\r\nand  grown  up  in a multi-racial society, when I  meet  foreign\r\n\r\nfriends, whether they are from Africa, Asia, America, Europe,  I\r\n\r\nam   able  to mix well with them.  Because I come from a  multi-racial  society,  I  am  interested  and  respectful  of   other\r\n\r\ncultures.   So  when my friends talk about their  countries  and\r\n\r\ntheir history, I listened with respect, with curiosity, and with\r\n\r\nthe  desire to understand more.  So we can talk well, we can mix\r\n\r\nwell,  and we can interact well.  I learn from them and learn  a\r\n\r\nlot of good things and benefit a great deal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I also gain some understanding and\r\n\r\nknowledge  about their history and culture.  And this proves  to\r\n\r\nbe  helpful to me when I handle overseas projects.  It  is  very\r\n\r\neasy  for me to communicate with them.  If you do not understand\r\n\r\na certain country, and you need to talk to their businessmen, to\r\n\r\nthe  clients, it will be difficult.  But, if you understand  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  its  culture,  it  will  be  easier  for  you   to\r\n\r\ncommunicate with the people from the country.  So we must always\r\n\r\nremember that we have a multi-racial and multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a great cornerstone, a great advantage, and  a  strong\r\n\r\npoint.   We must do all we can to preserve this advantage,  this\r\n\r\nstrong  point,  so that we can achieve even greater  success  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, when we talk about the S21 Vision, we must build\r\n\r\non what we have achieved.  We must have self-cultivation, family\r\n\r\ncohesion,  service to society and loyalty to  nation.   We  must\r\n\r\ncontinue   to  enhance  our  multi-racial  harmony  and   social\r\n\r\ncohesion.  It is only then that we are able to lay down  a  very\r\n\r\nstrong foundation for our society and country.  We will be  able\r\n\r\nto  strengthen our family, so that we can attack as we  advance,\r\n\r\nand defend as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1457</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe retreat.  We will have greater confidence in our action.  All\r\n\r\nour  people are more united together in realising the  challenge\r\n\r\nand ambition of S21.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the motion in the name\r\n\r\nof the Minister for Education on the S21 Vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in my younger days, whenever my parents and I walked  past\r\n\r\nthe Robinsons Departmental Store at Raffles Place, we just could\r\n\r\nnot  pluck  up  enough courage to walk through the  entrance  to\r\n\r\nenter  the store.  The only luxury we had was to peep  into  the\r\n\r\nstore  through the main entrance. Why did we not dare  to  enter\r\n\r\nthe shop?  Because at that time, Robinsons was perceived to be a\r\n\r\ndepartmental  store for the ang mohs.  At that  time,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  still  not  our home.  We had to be careful about  what  we\r\n\r\ncould do and could not do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Jalan Besar said he had the\r\n\r\ncourage to do so.  We saw his photograph with his Porsche in the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  this morning.  If this was 30-odd years ago,  people\r\n\r\nwould  call him lau hero or since he would be much younger then,\r\n\r\npeople  might  call him lau Yankee.  At that time,  the  Cricket\r\n\r\nClub  opposite  Parliament House was  a  typical  club  for  the\r\n\r\nEnglishmen,  and  not far from there stood Raffles  Hotel,  also\r\n\r\nanother  place  where the locals did not dare to  set  foot  on.\r\n\r\nWhy?   Because  Singapore was then still not our  home.   Today,\r\n\r\nRobinsons,  the Cricket Club and Raffles Hotel are places  where\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  patronise  freely.  Why?   Because  Singapore  has\r\n\r\ngained independence.  It is now our home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in Singapore today, foreigners throng our\r\n\r\npublic  places.   They  came  to Singapore,  and  together  with\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  they create wealth and prosperity for  themselves\r\n\r\nand for Singapore.  We have loosely referred to these people  as\r\n\r\n\"foreign  talents\".   But  some  Singaporeans  think   that   by\r\n\r\nadmitting  foreign  talents,  we  are  marginalising  our  local\r\n\r\ntalents.  Some perceive that by labelling foreigners as talents,\r\n\r\nwe give the impression that Singapore has no\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1458</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntalent  and  has to rely on foreign talents.  I am of  the  view\r\n\r\nthat  Singaporeans  who  have this misconception  are  small  in\r\n\r\nnumber,  but  we  should  try  to  correct  such  misconception.\r\n\r\nClearly,  Singapore is a country that values talents, foreigners\r\n\r\nand  Singaporeans  alike.   Singaporeans  themselves  appreciate\r\n\r\ntalents  too.   The Star Search Contest is a good  example.   We\r\n\r\ncould  see  that the two comperes that night were not  born  and\r\n\r\nbred  in  Singapore.  But they won Singaporeans over with  their\r\n\r\nwits  and  showmanship.  The Star Search winners on  that  night\r\n\r\nwere  also  not born and bred in Singapore.  Singaporeans  rated\r\n\r\nthem highly just the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Asian financial crisis struck at the\r\n\r\ntime  when  we were drawing up our vision for the 21st  century.\r\n\r\nSingapore  was also affected by the crisis.  Singaporeans  begin\r\n\r\nto  worry that their jobs may be taken over by foreigners.  They\r\n\r\nfear that foreigners will compete with them for their children's\r\n\r\nplaces  in  schools.   For this reason, some  Singaporeans  have\r\n\r\nmisgivings  about  foreigners.  The worries  of  this  group  of\r\n\r\npeople are understandable and can be overcome.  We only need  to\r\n\r\nask  ourselves: has the Singapore Government ever neglected  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of Singaporeans?  Has it not placed great  importance\r\n\r\nto  the  progress  of  Singaporeans?  The  Government  has  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  great lengths to attract foreign direct investments  to\r\n\r\ncreate job opportunities for our people.  To ensure that workers\r\n\r\nhave  the skills for the new industries, the Government has been\r\n\r\ndisbursing  funds through various channels, including  the  NTUC\r\n\r\nwhich  runs a series of skills redevelopment programmes to raise\r\n\r\nthe  skill levels of the workers.  Some companies employ foreign\r\n\r\nworkers   to  meet  their  expansion  needs.   But   then   some\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  think that foreigners have robbed  them  of  their\r\n\r\nchances of getting the job.  This is not true.  By employing one\r\n\r\nforeigner, it may bring more job opportunities for Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we take an SIA flight, we would have noticed that the\r\n\r\ncabin crew consists not only of Singaporeans but also other\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnationalities.  If the flight is bound for Tokyo, there will  be\r\n\r\nJapanese SIA girls.  If the flights are to Taipei and Hong Kong,\r\n\r\nthere  will be Hokkein-speaking or Cantonese-speaking SIA  girls\r\n\r\nfrom  Taiwan  and Hong Kong.  Singaporeans enjoy  the  value  of\r\n\r\nthese  foreign SIA girls. They appreciate these foreign  talents\r\n\r\nand  find  every  excuse  to strike up conversation  with  them.\r\n\r\nForeign  passengers  also  appreciate them  because  the  native\r\n\r\naccents  of these foreign SIA girls make them feel very much  at\r\n\r\nhome.   If we have more Japanese, Koreans, Americans and  French\r\n\r\nflying  SIA because of SIA's efforts to make them feel at  home,\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  more demands for flights to these destinations.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we would need more foreign SIA girls and even more\r\n\r\nlocal SIA girls.  So these foreign workers do not take away  our\r\n\r\nrice  bowls.   On  the  contrary, they have  created   more  job\r\n\r\nopportunities for our local people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the idea of opportunities for all, that\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean should have the opportunity to give full  play\r\n\r\nto  his  potential and be recognised for that,  is what we  have\r\n\r\nbeen striving for.  Over the last three years, many of our taxi-drivers, bus-drivers, cleaners and healthcare workers have  been\r\n\r\npicked  as model workers.  They received their awards  from  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister.  This year, another 100 workers from our seaport\r\n\r\nand  airport will also be receiving the Model Worker Awards from\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister.  How many countries honour their workers  in\r\n\r\nthis  way?  We will nurture local talents to develop their  full\r\n\r\npotential.   But we also need foreign workers.  This is  because\r\n\r\nwe do not have enough talent.  While we make use of what we have\r\n\r\nas  much as possible, we must also adopt an open mind to embrace\r\n\r\nforeign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in ancient China, bright and ambitious\r\n\r\nscholars  sat for the Imperial Examinations to earn a  place  in\r\n\r\nthe  Imperial  Court.   Very often, the emperor  would  eye  the\r\n\r\nscholar who emerged first or what we call the zuan yuan to  give\r\n\r\nhim  the  hand of the princess.  The emperor knew that the  zuan\r\n\r\nyuan was\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1460</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  best  talent  in  the country.  Similarly,  company  bosses\r\n\r\nsometimes  marry  their daughters to their employees  whom  they\r\n\r\nconsider  to be of high calibre.  On the same logic and  reason,\r\n\r\nwhy  should  Singapore not bring in foreign talent?   I  believe\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would understand this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the five ideas of the Singapore 21: Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  Matters; Strong Families: Our  Foundation  and  Our\r\n\r\nFuture;  Opportunities for All: The Singapore Heartbeat: Feeling\r\n\r\nPassionately   about  Singapore;  Active  Citizens:   Making   a\r\n\r\nDifference to Society; and Together, We Make the Difference  are\r\n\r\ninter-related.   The five basic beliefs are spin-offs  from  our\r\n\r\nShared  Values.   The Shared Values are Nation before  Community\r\n\r\nand  Society  above  Self; Family as a Basic  Unit  of  Society;\r\n\r\nCommunity Support and Respect for the Individual; Consensus, Not\r\n\r\nConflict; Racial and Religious Harmony.  As we strive to realise\r\n\r\nour  vision in the 21st century, our shared values still  stand.\r\n\r\nWe must not lax in upholding these values.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of a family trip I took a few years ago.\r\n\r\nMy family went on a trip to the United States and Canada with  a\r\n\r\ntour group consisting of about 30 Singaporeans.  Throughout  the\r\n\r\ntrip,  we  heard a constant stream of grouses among Singaporeans\r\n\r\nof  this group.  The SIA flight we took was delayed due to  some\r\n\r\ntechnical  problems.  When we arrived in the United States,  the\r\n\r\nairline  gave every passenger a box of chocolates as a token  of\r\n\r\nits  apology.  A Singaporean was heard saying, \"They think  that\r\n\r\nwe  can be appeased with a box of chocolates!  We should sue the\r\n\r\ncompany. We should fine them $300.  Get compensation from them!\"\r\n\r\nThis is how Singaporeans feel about matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year we went on another trip to the Silk Road in\r\n\r\nChina.   There  were some 60 Singaporeans in  that  group.   The\r\n\r\ntrain  took us through the Gobi desert.  Throughout the journey,\r\n\r\nas  the group members took in the magnificent sights, they could\r\n\r\nbe  heard heaping praises on Singapore's policies and the way of\r\n\r\ndoing things.  My daughter asked me, \"Well,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1461</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  are  all  Singaporeans.  Why do they  have  so  different\r\n\r\nviews?\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a reality of our society. As we\r\n\r\ndiscuss  the  Singapore  21  ideas,  we  must  concede  to   the\r\n\r\nvulnerability of the Singapore society.  Singapore is a  society\r\n\r\nwith  few communities.  Recently, the discussions on the Chinese\r\n\r\nelite, the SAP schools and the scholarship controversy remind us\r\n\r\nthat  for Singapore to successfully move to a knowledge  economy\r\n\r\nand realise its 21st century ideas, we must work very hard.   We\r\n\r\nmust  increase  the  common ground of our  multi-racial,  multi-lingual and multi-religious society.  Most importantly, we  need\r\n\r\nto  go  back to our basic values.  We must not give up our basic\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in 30 years, the ideas of Singapore 21\r\n\r\nwill bear fruit.  By that time, Admiral Teo would be in his 70s.\r\n\r\nIf by then we have the chance to meet again, we will still agree\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  because  of  our  pragmatism  and  diligence  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are able to realise its vision and  scale  greater\r\n\r\nheights.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, thank you for catching your eye and\r\n\r\nfor giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Report by the Singapore 21 Committee which was\r\n\r\nheaded  by  our Minister for Education and 10 other  Members  of\r\n\r\nthis  House has received wide support from the public  since  it\r\n\r\nwas launched by the Prime Minister on 24th April 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a political manifesto. It is a study by\r\n\r\nboth  the  PAP  and non-PAP MPs, namely, my two NMP  colleagues.\r\n\r\nMore  than  that, it has seen the participation  by  some  6,000\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  whose  contributions  the  Committee  has  rightly\r\n\r\nacknowledged.   These  people come from different  organisations\r\n\r\nand they included Members of this House.  I see the names of  Mr\r\n\r\nLow  Thia  Khiang and Mr S. Iswaran and many other  names,  some\r\n\r\nfamiliar,  some not familiar.  Sir, the contributions have  come\r\n\r\nfrom community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1462</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nleaders, self-help groups, professional bodies and civic bodies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they cover the mood of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been active public discussions and it should be\r\n\r\nso.   The  public interest has been aroused.  Sir,  I  was  very\r\n\r\ntouched and impressed by last Saturday's Insight Report  by  two\r\n\r\nStraits Times' journalists, Warren Fernandez and Chua Lee Hoong.\r\n\r\nBoth of them were in fact members of the Committee.  It reflects\r\n\r\nthe  thinking of young Singaporeans about Singapore.  With  your\r\n\r\npermission, Sir, may I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Every Singaporean must matter as an end in itself. And\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean will matter only when other Singaporeans  let\r\n\r\nthem  feel  that they too are valued.  Put in this context,  the\r\n\r\nideal  that  `Every Singaporean Matters' is no  mere  motherhood\r\n\r\nstatement.   It  is  a  bold, radical,  ambitious  view  of  how\r\n\r\nSingaporeans want society to be, and what it must do to make  it\r\n\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>This epitomises the values that many Members have tried to raise\r\n\r\nin this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge all political parties to join hands with\r\n\r\nthe  Government because on Singapore 21, we cannot afford to  be\r\n\r\npartisan.  We must develop a strong sense of attachment to  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  As the Prime Minister has always said, we must have  a\r\n\r\npassion for our nation.  This is where our roots lie and this is\r\n\r\nwhere our children's future lies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in seven chapters, the Committee has studied the\r\n\r\nproblems  we are facing and also provided the answer.  The  five\r\n\r\ndilemmas that the Committee faced are as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Less stressful life vs Retaining the drive;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Needs of senior citizens vs Aspirations of the young;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Attracting talent vs Looking after Singaporeans;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Internationalisation/Regionalisation vs Singapore as\r\n\r\nHome;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Consultation and consensus vs Decisiveness and quick in\r\n\r\naction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of these five dilemmas have come five ideas and these five\r\n\r\nideas are worthy of consideration by this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important for us to create a vibrant Singapore\r\n\r\nwhere every citizen feels for his country and is prepared to  do\r\n\r\nhis utmost for the country.  This is our heartland.  This is our\r\n\r\nmotherland.   Citizens, whether born in Singapore or  those  who\r\n\r\ndecided  to  make this their home, have only one dream,  to  see\r\n\r\nSingapore prosper and that people enjoy a good life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to the other countries, Sir, we are a very young\r\n\r\nnation.   Future generations of Singaporeans will look upon  us.\r\n\r\nThey will ask if we had laid a strong foundation.  If the answer\r\n\r\nis positive, then they will credit us and strengthen the system.\r\n\r\nIf  we are weak and divided, they will never forgive us for  our\r\n\r\nsins   of   commission.   Singaporeans  must  provide  emotional\r\n\r\nanchors.  And let me quote from the Report:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Singapore is home because of emotional and social anchors\r\n\r\nin  the  country.  Family, friendship, fond memories of  growing\r\n\r\nup,  landmarks,  well-known  areas and  buildings  -  all  these\r\n\r\nprovide  a  feeling of familiarity and comfort in the  midst  of\r\n\r\nrapid change.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will recollect that some years ago this House\r\n\r\nendorsed the Shared Values.  These are important values.  One of\r\n\r\nthe values is consensus building.  The Government must encourage\r\n\r\nthe  process of consultation.  Some people feel the  process  of\r\n\r\nconsultation  is  a  mere public relations exercise.   They  are\r\n\r\nwrong.   When Government leaders do not agree with the  proposal\r\n\r\nor   criticism,  I  urge  them  that  they  should  not   become\r\n\r\nadversarial.   Take Catherine Lim's episode.   One  of  the  MPs\r\n\r\ncould  have  replied.  But it would occupy more  space  than  it\r\n\r\ndeserved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me touch on another political innovation of\r\n\r\nSingapore  which is a creature of Prime Minister Goh  Chok  Tong\r\n\r\nand  I  refer to the GPC.  It is a very novel institution, still\r\n\r\nyoung in Singapore.  I remember President Wee in his address  to\r\n\r\nParliament  years  back  said  that  the  GPC's  role  would  be\r\n\r\nenlarged.   The  Prime Minister also said that  the  GPC's  role\r\n\r\nwould  be  increased to gather views from the public.   I  would\r\n\r\nurge the Government\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1464</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  seriously  consider  how the GPC's  role  could  be  further\r\n\r\nincreased  to  reflect the public view.  I would also  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   to   give  the  GPC  financial  and  administrative\r\n\r\nassistance so that it can be more effective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before a Bill is introduced, the Minister would often\r\n\r\ntake  the  GPC into confidence.  The GPC could organise feedback\r\n\r\nwith  interested groups to study the issue.  This is a  valuable\r\n\r\ninstitution  and  we should try to see how this  body  could  be\r\n\r\nfurther strengthened.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, the House has seen two Select Committee\r\n\r\nReports  submitted and I refer to the Administration  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nLaw  (Amendment)  Bill and the Land Titles (Strata)  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  Both these committees received numerous public proposals.\r\n\r\nIt shows that our public is concerned.  It shows something more.\r\n\r\nThe  Select  Committee, the Government and this  Parliament  are\r\n\r\nconcerned with the public views.  The public views were in  fact\r\n\r\nincorporated in the law.  Indirectly, the public has become  law\r\n\r\nmakers.  Very few countries have this institution as we have  it\r\n\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue which I would like to touch on is active\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The Report says, and I quote again:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We will benefit from greater responsiveness, more\r\n\r\nconsultation and a wider range of views and ideas.  The crux  is\r\n\r\nhow  to  do  so without losing the efficiency, decisiveness  and\r\n\r\ncollective action that has enabled Singaporeans to thrive.   How\r\n\r\ndo   we   build  more  mutual  respect,  trust,  ownership   and\r\n\r\nparticipation, so that our many contributions and  efforts  will\r\n\r\ncombine together to steer Singapore to a brighter future?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consultative process has already started some\r\n\r\nyears  back  and  it is being strengthened.  Before  any  public\r\n\r\npolicy  is introduced, our Ministers, MPs and community  leaders\r\n\r\nget the feel of the ground, listen to public views and then take\r\n\r\ninto  consideration these views when the policy  is  formulated.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  good policy and we should see how we could  further\r\n\r\nstrengthen this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would urge the Government to do is when a public\r\n\r\nproposal is accepted, the Government should acknowledge\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublicly that this is a public proposal and give credit  to  the\r\n\r\npeople who have introduced it.  In this way, the public would be\r\n\r\nencouraged to submit their views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would urge both the Government party and Opposition\r\n\r\nparties  to  come to terms with the fundamental values  that  we\r\n\r\nshare  in  this  country.   They are our  sovereignty,  national\r\n\r\ndefence,  multi-racialism  and  multi-lingualism.   To  question\r\n\r\nthese  values  is  to destroy the very fabric of  our  Singapore\r\n\r\nsociety.   We  must take steps to strengthen  these  values.   I\r\n\r\nremember that some years back, when the Maintenance of Religious\r\n\r\nHarmony  Bill was introduced, some people felt that  it  was  an\r\n\r\ninfringement.  We have seen that, because of this law, there has\r\n\r\nnot  been a single case of any religious disturbance.   It  just\r\n\r\ngoes  to  show  how  farsighted the  Government  was.   In  many\r\n\r\ncountries, the opposite is the situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans feel that if they do not agree with the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policies,  they would be  black-listed.   This  is\r\n\r\nindeed very sad.  There must be mutual respect and trust between\r\n\r\nthe people and the Government.  We must allow diverging views to\r\n\r\nappear and try to work out a consensus.  But we must at the same\r\n\r\ntime  admit  that not all views can be accommodated.   So  those\r\n\r\nwhose views are not accepted must see it in this perspective.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can only have a vision and a dream if we have a\r\n\r\nstrong  and  stable Government.  We have seen the fate  of  weak\r\n\r\ngovernments and, worse of all, coalition governments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must evolve our own political culture. The British\r\n\r\nsystem  is  adversarial.  We should encourage, as  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  consensus  building.  We must  institutionalise  these\r\n\r\ninto our political process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, may I urge some change in the thinking.\r\n\r\nIn many of the former British colonies, we call the ruling party\r\n\r\nas  the  government  party  and  the  opposition  party  as  the\r\n\r\nopposition.   A  better  phraseology  would  be  to   call   the\r\n\r\nGovernment party as the majority party and the opposition as the\r\n\r\nminority party.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1466</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the title of the Report \"Together, We Make the\r\n\r\nDifference\" is very apt.  These five words are pancharatna which\r\n\r\nin  Sanskrit and Hindi means five jewels.  In Malay, I think  it\r\n\r\nmeans the same.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me share my own experience with one organisation\r\n\r\nwith  which  I have been involved.  I would like to disclose  my\r\n\r\ninterest  that I am a member of the Hindu Advisory Board  and  a\r\n\r\nformer member of the Hindu Endowments Board (HEB).  The HEB  has\r\n\r\nbeen  involved in many community projects.  We have seen  active\r\n\r\nparticipation  by  the  Hindu  community  in  various  projects,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  in  the area of education, social  or  medical.\r\n\r\nBecause we have a strong leadership.  This has come about in the\r\n\r\nlast  15  years when Mr S.R. Nathan was appointed Chairman.   He\r\n\r\ntransformed the whole of the Hindu Endowments Board into a  very\r\n\r\ndynamic  organisation.  He and his successors, like V.R.  Nathan\r\n\r\nand  V.K. Rajan, built on this base and today, numerous projects\r\n\r\nare  undertaken by the Board and people from all walks  of  life\r\n\r\nhave  come  to support the projects.  It is therefore  important\r\n\r\nthat  the country has dedicated leaders who can provide  impetus\r\n\r\nand  inspire  the  community to greater  heights  to  serve  the\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I move on to the subject of strong families. Although we\r\n\r\nhave  strong family ties, we cannot run away from the fact  that\r\n\r\nthe  extended families are slowly diminishing.  We must come  to\r\n\r\nterms  with this issue and a study has to be made as to  how  we\r\n\r\ncan  resolve this problem. As economic necessity dictates,  both\r\n\r\nparents  are working.  The children have to be looked  after  by\r\n\r\nsomebody  else, either a maid or relative.  But the maid  cannot\r\n\r\nsubstitute the mother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad the Minister for Community Development has\r\n\r\ntold  the  House  yesterday that family  ties  will  be  further\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  I am heartened by his remarks.  I also agree with\r\n\r\nmy  Parliamentary colleague that we should seriously  study  the\r\n\r\nfive-day  week  proposal.  My proposal is this.   The  rest  day\r\n\r\ncould be any day from Friday to Sunday.  If a person works  from\r\n\r\nMonday to Saturday,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhe  could have his rest days on Sunday and Monday.  In this way,\r\n\r\nwe  would not disturb the economic life of Singapore.  I am glad\r\n\r\nthat  some  firms  have started it.  On this  note,  I  join  my\r\n\r\nfriend,  Mr  Chan  Soo  Sen, in quoting  from  the  Indian  epic\r\n\r\nRamayana jaha sumti taha sampti nana . which simply means  where\r\n\r\nthere  is  unity of mind, unity of purpose, there is  peace  and\r\n\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> I rise in support of the motion\r\n\r\nas proposed by the Minister for Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, I had a meeting with my grassroots leaders\r\n\r\nto  discuss the S21 Report.  To my disappointment, my grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders  told  me  that not many Singaporeans  are  particularly\r\n\r\nexcited or keen on the ideas presented in the S21 Report.   This\r\n\r\nconfirms   the   assessment  by  our  Education  Minister   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans scored poorly in the five ideas as proposed by  the\r\n\r\nS21 Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore vision has apparently not sparked much\r\n\r\ndiscussion  as  evidenced by the lack  of  coffeeshop  talks  or\r\n\r\ncomments in the forum page over the last two weeks.  I think the\r\n\r\nSingapore  heartbeat  is  missing.   The  Singapore   heart   is\r\n\r\nsuffering  from  \"cardiac arrest\". We  need  to  take  immediate\r\n\r\naction  to  jumpstart the heart and guide the heart to  function\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop passion for our country, we must rally the\r\n\r\nhearts  of  all  Singaporeans  to  pursue  the  same  vision  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a home worth returning and, if need be,  fighting\r\n\r\nand  dying for.  To achieve this, I would like to suggest  three\r\n\r\nareas to activate the Singapore heartbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Singaporeans must have good hearts. As the\r\n\r\nChinese  saying goes, \"hao xin you hao bao\".  Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nhave  good  hearts  that  show  compassion  for  others  in  all\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home, we must make a concerted effort to strengthen our\r\n\r\nties with family\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1468</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmembers and relatives.  The rapid nuclearisation of families and\r\n\r\nthe  fast pace of living have reduced the contact time of family\r\n\r\nmembers.  This will have an adverse impact on the kinship  among\r\n\r\nfamily  members   We  need  to  refocus  our  attention  on  our\r\n\r\nfamilies,  and  take  the responsibility  to  strengthen  family\r\n\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned about the increasing number of cases of\r\n\r\nfamily break-ups and neighbour disputes that I have attended  to\r\n\r\nin  my  meet-the-people  sessions.  Some  Singaporeans  are  too\r\n\r\nengrossed  in the pursuit of materialistic needs at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  their families.  Some have relinquished their responsibility\r\n\r\nto  look after their families to pursue their own goals.   I  am\r\n\r\nparticularly  disturbed to hear of cases of  children  \"dumping\"\r\n\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fast aging population, it is vital for us to address\r\n\r\nthis  fundamental  issue  of  family  responsibility.   Although\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are facing intense competition, we must  not  take\r\n\r\nour family members for granted.  We must always remind ourselves\r\n\r\nto  spend  time and build bonds in our families.   My  neighbour\r\n\r\ntold me this morning that at the rate we are working, all of  us\r\n\r\nwill  \"wear out\" very quickly and face serious problems when  we\r\n\r\nage.   I  am  glad  that  the  S21  Report  has  emphasised  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  family bonding.  At the  end  of  the  day,  our\r\n\r\nfamilies matter more than anything in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the workplace, we must build friendship with our\r\n\r\ncolleagues through care and concern.  Our hearts must  transform\r\n\r\nour deeds into creating a caring and vibrant working environment\r\n\r\nfor  everyone.  We must learn to work in teams so as to  improve\r\n\r\nour  work  culture,  productivity,  and  job  satisfaction.   To\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  the next century, all Singaporeans must  develop  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Work  Culture,  which  emphasises  on  teamwork   and\r\n\r\ncooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having a good and caring heart will enable\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to feel passionate about his or her country and its\r\n\r\npeople.  It will make Singaporeans deeply rooted to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1469</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Singaporeans must have a positive attitude. A\r\n\r\ngood heart will develop a good attitude.  This is the key factor\r\n\r\nof  success in life.  We must adopt a positive attitude in life.\r\n\r\nWe  must  develop an inner drive to achieve our goals  in  life.\r\n\r\nWith  a  positive attitude, we open our minds to further enhance\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  our  lives.   From  young,  children  must  be\r\n\r\ncultivated  to have positive attitude in learning.   This  skill\r\n\r\nwill  provide the necessary impetus for the young to  develop  a\r\n\r\npassion  for  learning.  With a positive attitude, there  is  no\r\n\r\nbarrier to knowledge acquisition.  Singaporeans must learn  that\r\n\r\nthe  acquisition of knowledge is not only for economic purposes.\r\n\r\nKnowledge will also keep the mind healthy and, as such,  improve\r\n\r\nour  quality  of  life.  But how do we train people  to  have  a\r\n\r\npositive attitude?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A total approach is needed to inculcate a nation of people\r\n\r\nwith positive attitude.  It must first start from the family  to\r\n\r\nthe   school   and  finally  to  the  workplace  and  community.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks  must be set to guide all Singaporeans to  develop  a\r\n\r\npositive  attitude.   It  is about time  Singaporeans  took  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to change their attitude and mindset  to  further\r\n\r\nenhance their quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Singaporeans must lead meaningful lives.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must believe in doing good things for their  fellow\r\n\r\ncountrymen  and  enriching their lives.  As highlighted  in  the\r\n\r\nradio,  today's education does not focus on the heroic deeds  of\r\n\r\ngood  leaders  and  Samaritans.  Children are not  given  enough\r\n\r\nexposure to have mentors in their lives.  As a result, they  may\r\n\r\nnot  be able to develop a passion to pursue their real interests\r\n\r\nand goals in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the setback we suffer in focusing on Mathematics\r\n\r\nand  Science  in  our  education system.   A  grassroots  leader\r\n\r\nrecently  made this comment: \"Singaporeans have good  scientific\r\n\r\nminds  but  lack  the  human touch.\"   Our  logical  minds  have\r\n\r\nsometimes retarded our development of friendships and pursuit of\r\n\r\nother  interests in life.  This is aggravated  by  the  pace  of\r\n\r\nworking   resulting  in  the  unhealthy  stress   situation   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  So, there is a need\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1470</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor  all  Singaporeans to redefine life.  There  must  be  ample\r\n\r\nopportunities for Singaporeans to lead a meaningful and fruitful\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, a colleague of mine told me that he has\r\n\r\nvisited  a  retirement  village in the  United  States  and  was\r\n\r\nshocked  to hear the conversations among the residents  in  that\r\n\r\nvillage.  All the conversations by the residents were focused on\r\n\r\ntheir  sad stories or regrets in life, such as not having  spent\r\n\r\nenough time with their children, failing to achieve their  goals\r\n\r\nin  life, having a poor attitude towards work, not having enough\r\n\r\nfriends,  regrets  for ignoring a healthy lifestyle,  and  being\r\n\r\nleft alone by their family members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Singaporeans do not want to end up in such a\r\n\r\nsituation of regrets.  Since the launching of the S21 Report,  I\r\n\r\nwonder how many Singaporeans have bought a copy of the Report or\r\n\r\nread  it.  I would urge all Singaporeans to take the first  step\r\n\r\ninto their future by reading the Report.  Let us rejuvenate  the\r\n\r\nSingapore heartbeat to lead a better life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to suggest a punchline for the S21\r\n\r\nReport to guide Singaporeans to achieve their vision in the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury  -  \"Have a good heart, adopt a positive  attitude,  and\r\n\r\nlead a meaningful life!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, ten years ago,\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister set an agenda in \"The Next Lap\" for Singapore\r\n\r\nto  work  towards  in  nation building.   Despite  the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  we  can  consider that the lap has  been  completed  in\r\n\r\nrecord  time.   On  the 24th of last month, the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nlaunched  Singapore 21 to set the vision of a shared perspective\r\n\r\nof  what  Singaporeans want, as a nation, to become in the  next\r\n\r\nmillennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the last three decades, the engine that drove\r\n\r\nSingapore  forward was provided by the Government, the Singapore\r\n\r\n21  aims to have every Singaporean as a participating factor, so\r\n\r\nthat  they  will be the co-motivators in deciding what direction\r\n\r\nour country should move\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1471</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards.  There will be many discussions and debates in the next\r\n\r\nfew  months  on  this very ambitious but nevertheless  essential\r\n\r\nexercise.   All this is necessary if we desire to  continue  our\r\n\r\nsuccess in bringing ourselves forward to become one of the  most\r\n\r\nadvanced global cities in the world.  We will aspire not only to\r\n\r\nattain  a  high standard of living, but also become a culturally\r\n\r\nand   intellectually  rich  advanced  country.   In  the  global\r\n\r\ncontext,  the  timing cannot be more critical as  well  as  more\r\n\r\nexciting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world-wide changes we have seen and are currently\r\n\r\nexperiencing are so phenomenal that one is hard put  to  predict\r\n\r\nwhat  sort of a world we will be living in, say, 10 to 20 years'\r\n\r\ntime.   The  acceleration  of change,  especially  in  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade,  has  been so rapid that the state of the world  affairs\r\n\r\nhas far surpassed what the futuristic author, Alvin Toffler, had\r\n\r\nenvisioned  in his then ground-breaking and revolutionary  book,\r\n\r\nFuture Shock.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans of this generation are very fortunate. The\r\n\r\nworld  has never had so much to offer to an individual in  terms\r\n\r\nof  technological advancement that affects almost all aspects of\r\n\r\nour  lives.   Also, we are living in one of the most stable  and\r\n\r\nmost  peaceful periods in our history.  This is especially  true\r\n\r\nin   Singapore  where  we  are  moving  into  an  era  of  great\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  excitement, the result of  many  painstaking\r\n\r\nformative years of nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a product of the 20th century and I consider myself\r\n\r\nextremely fortunate that my most formative and productive  years\r\n\r\ncoincide with the Singapore success story within the past  three\r\n\r\ndecades.   It has been most exciting and fulfilling,  but  I  am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that the success story is only at the beginning.   We\r\n\r\nhave  arrived at the base camp.  We still have the highest  peak\r\n\r\nto  reach.   Singapore 21 provides the direction.   We  have  to\r\n\r\npossess  the  courage, stamina and, above all, determination  to\r\n\r\nreach our final destination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of meritocracy has worked well for Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe concept of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1472</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndrawing  out  the  best  to  lead  Singapore,  whether  in   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  or  in the civil service, cannot and should  not  be\r\n\r\nfaulted  and  should continue to be so.  However, in  the  past,\r\n\r\nidentifying the best has always been through assessment of their\r\n\r\nacademic excellence.  Generally speaking, I have no qualms about\r\n\r\nthat.   However,  Singapore is a very small  country.   We  must\r\n\r\nharness every one with potential to contribute and although,  by\r\n\r\nand  large,  if one attains high academic excellence,  in  other\r\n\r\nwords, if he or she becomes a scholar, it is logical to consider\r\n\r\nthat  he  possesses  a  certain high level of  intelligence  and\r\n\r\nability to excel in his various undertakings.  However, it would\r\n\r\nbe  a  big  mistake  to  ignore the fact  that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nsuccessful  individuals  who have  not  been  known  to  achieve\r\n\r\nacademic  excellence and yet have been able to  excel  in  their\r\n\r\nchosen  fields.   History has proven that outstanding  achievers\r\n\r\nare  not  necessarily top academic achievers.  Notable  examples\r\n\r\nare  Einstein, Edison and Winston Churchill.  Bill Gates was  an\r\n\r\naverage  Harvard student who dropped out of school to start  his\r\n\r\nown enterprise.  More revealing is that in the Fortune 500, very\r\n\r\nfew CEOs are actually scholars.  In fact, quite a number of them\r\n\r\nwere high school dropouts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have numerous examples, such as\r\n\r\ntechnopreneur   Sim  Wong  Hoo,  banker  Lien  Ying   Chow   and\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  Kwek Hong Png.  They cannot be classified  as  top\r\n\r\nacademic  achievers but nevertheless, they have  been  extremely\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in what they were or are doing. This is because,  to\r\n\r\nachieve  success,  knowledge alone  is  not  sufficient.  It  is\r\n\r\ntalent,  creativity,  perseverance and,  above  all,  a  burning\r\n\r\ndesire and passion to succeed.  These are elements that drive  a\r\n\r\nperson ever forward to fulfill his dreams.  In fact, looking  at\r\n\r\nour financial, industrial and business sectors, many individuals\r\n\r\nwho  make tremendous contributions in driving Singapore  forward\r\n\r\nare  not  people  with  high academic  qualifications  from  top\r\n\r\nuniversities all over the world, but many make up  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nformal  education by perseverance, creativity and a  passion  to\r\n\r\nsucceed in whatever they do.  It is, therefore, very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1473</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportant  that  while  trying to emphasise  the  importance  of\r\n\r\nturning  out  scholars  and  high  academic  achievers  in   our\r\n\r\neducation  policy, it should not be so rigidly  structured  that\r\n\r\nthose individuals who, for whatever reason, whether the lack  of\r\n\r\nopportunities  to attend a good school or those  who  have  been\r\n\r\naffected by family problems in their childhood and, as a result,\r\n\r\nwere  unable to attain good academic qualifications at  a  young\r\n\r\nage,  are  written off as non-achievers.  By doing so,  we  shut\r\n\r\nthem  out  as potentially important contributors to our nation's\r\n\r\nprogress and the Singapore 21 vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe, in Singapore, anyone who has the aspiration can\r\n\r\nhave his ambition fulfilled.  I personally had to overcome great\r\n\r\nodds  to complete my secondary as well as my tertiary education,\r\n\r\nnot  so  much  academically,  but  I  had  to  overcome  extreme\r\n\r\ndifficult  circumstances beyond my control, such as  bad  timing\r\n\r\nand  having  missed out on the opportunity to go to a  good  and\r\n\r\ndecent  school or a top university.  Yet, I was able to overcome\r\n\r\nall  the odds and stayed focused to pursue my own dream.  I  can\r\n\r\nremember vividly once the whole class was asked what we  aspired\r\n\r\nto  be  in  the  future.  When I said that I  wanted  to  be  an\r\n\r\narchitect,  my  form  teacher  sarcastically  said  that  I  was\r\n\r\ndreaming  an  impossible dream.  In a  way,  I  did  succeed  in\r\n\r\nfulfilling  that  dream.  For that, I have  to  consider  myself\r\n\r\nfortunate to have chosen Singapore as my home and that gives  me\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to be what I am today.  At the present time,  so\r\n\r\nmuch emphasis has been placed on education.  I believe that very\r\n\r\nfew  of  our younger generation will have to go through  what  I\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through to obtain their academic qualification,  and\r\n\r\nfinding their place in the sun.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 recognises that every Singaporean's\r\n\r\ncontribution  is  important  in the  total  scheme  of  bringing\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the highest level that we can attain as a  nation.\r\n\r\nThe  Singapore  of  the  21st century  must  be  a  country  for\r\n\r\neveryone.   It  should  offer  the opportunity  to  everyone  to\r\n\r\nfulfill their dreams at whatever level and in whatever situation\r\n\r\nthey are fitted into.  I support the idea of imbuing every\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1474</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporean with a sense of belonging and that he is  not  being\r\n\r\nleft  out  as a peripheral digit or that he is just a supporting\r\n\r\ncast in the drama of life.  We must not marginalise the ordinary\r\n\r\nfolks.  Every citizen has something to contribute to our society\r\n\r\nand  nation, whether at the highest office in the Government  or\r\n\r\njust  a  humble  hawker at the food centre.  We need  executives\r\n\r\nbut,  at  the  same time, we cannot ignore the contributions  of\r\n\r\nclerical  officers.   We need engineers to keep  things  running\r\n\r\nsmoothly, but we also need artists to feed the hearts and  souls\r\n\r\nof our people.  The satisfaction of achievement should be shared\r\n\r\nby  all,  CEOs  and  blue-collar ordinary  workers  alike.   The\r\n\r\nconcept  of  one working for the collective good of  the  entire\r\n\r\nnation is an empowering one and bears emphasising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there has been a lot of debate on foreign talent,\r\n\r\nbut  the issue here is not whether it is foreign or local.   The\r\n\r\noperative  word is \"talent\".  In achieving the target  of  equal\r\n\r\nopportunity, no one should exploit this system, whether local or\r\n\r\nforeign.   Real  talent must always be recognised and  utilised.\r\n\r\nThose  who  inflate  the true worth under the  guise  of  having\r\n\r\ntalent, whether foreign or local, cannot be accepted.  We should\r\n\r\nmake  Singapore a place where opportunities are given  to  those\r\n\r\nwho  set  out to seek, work and to achieve.  This is significant\r\n\r\nas  we  want to have a genuine foreign talent to take  root  and\r\n\r\nflourish.  A transient foreign talent cannot add much  value  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  touch on this issue because, in  order  to  give\r\n\r\nconfidence  to  all  Singaporeans, it is  imperative  that  they\r\n\r\nshould  feel  comfortable with the idea of foreign  talent.   In\r\n\r\norder  to enable us all to achieve the goal of Singapore 21,  we\r\n\r\nneed talent and committed individuals, whether foreign or local.\r\n\r\nGiven our limited human resources, we have no other alternative.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that is what made the United States a nation where  most\r\n\r\npeople  around the world aspire to settle and chase the American\r\n\r\ndream.   Perception is just as important as reality.  If  people\r\n\r\nperceive  that the United States is a land of opportunity  where\r\n\r\ndreams  can be made to come true, then they would go  there  and\r\n\r\nmake that as their final destination.  We should set out\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  emulate  and  make  Singapore a place where  opportunity  is\r\n\r\nabundant and those who dare to dream would be rewarded, a  place\r\n\r\nwhere everyone, no matter how humble their background, can  find\r\n\r\ntheir pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and reach their goal\r\n\r\nin  life.   We  will have our own Bill Gates,  our  own  Michael\r\n\r\nJordan and the success story of rags to riches.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Committee of Singapore 21 for coming out\r\n\r\nwith  such  a  comprehensive and far-reaching  Report.   As  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of  Singapore 21 is to harness the  best  ideas  from\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean, the Committee should continue to  assist  in\r\n\r\ngathering all the feedback from ongoing discussions, forums  and\r\n\r\nseminars  to ensure more ideas and contributions, to crystallise\r\n\r\nthe  agenda that will be the pathfinder to guide Singapore  into\r\n\r\nthe next millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n<br>2.38 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwant  to  put  this debate on Singapore 21 (S21) in  its  proper\r\n\r\nperspective.   When  I  asked Teo Chee Hean  to  chair  the  S21\r\n\r\nCommittee,  I saw it as part of a continuing exercise  to  build\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  nation.   In  the  first  phase  of  our  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding,  we  concentrated on giving  Singaporeans  a  physical\r\n\r\nstake  in the country.  For the next phase, we have to grow  the\r\n\r\nemotional roots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the S21 Committee is not an end in itself.\r\n\r\nIt  must  be implemented, and strengthen the process of  nation-building.   For Singapore is not yet a nation.   It  is  only  a\r\n\r\nstate, a sovereign entity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A state is not necessarily a nation. Harvard Professor\r\n\r\nRupert  Emerson, in his book, From Empire to Nation,  defined  a\r\n\r\n\"nation\" as:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'A single people, traditionally fixed on a well-defined\r\n\r\nterritory, speaking the same language and preferably a  language\r\n\r\nall  its own, possessing a distinctive culture, and shaped to  a\r\n\r\ncommon   mould   by   many  generations  of  shared   historical\r\n\r\nexperience.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1476</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this definition, Singapore is not a nation. We do not\r\n\r\nall  speak the same language, nor do we share the same  religion\r\n\r\nand customs.  We have different ancestors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept the hand that we were dealt with - 600\r\n\r\nsquare kilometres, no natural resources, densely populated,  and\r\n\r\na disparate collection of people, most of whom had migrated from\r\n\r\nother parts of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Senior Minister and his generation overcame great odds\r\n\r\nand   laid  the  foundation  for  the  Singapore  nation.   They\r\n\r\nemphasised  multi-racialism  and  gave  every  race   an   equal\r\n\r\nopportunity in Singapore.   This multi-racial country has lasted\r\n\r\n33 years, beyond the skeptics' expectation.  But whether it will\r\n\r\nlast  the  next  100 years will depend on whether the  different\r\n\r\nraces can gel as one people, feel as one people and pulsate with\r\n\r\nthe same Singapore heartbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I raise this question because it is important for us to\r\n\r\ndebate the Singapore 21 vision against the background of nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Nations - Jews and Serbs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations which have lasted 1000 years have an almost\r\n\r\nhomogeneous  population sharing the same culture  and  religion,\r\n\r\nspeaking  the  same  language and practising the  same  customs.\r\n\r\nThey  descended  from the same DNA pool.   Such  a  people  will\r\n\r\ninstinctively group together when threatened.  They  will  fight\r\n\r\ntogether  and,  if necessary, die together, in  order  that  the\r\n\r\ntribe they belong to will survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jews are one such tribe. When Israel was threatened,\r\n\r\nJews   all  over  the  world  rushed  to  support  it.   Israeli\r\n\r\nreservists overseas dashed back to defend the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Serbs too form a nation. However reprehensible their\r\n\r\nethnic cleansing in Kosovo, they are standing up to NATO as  one\r\n\r\nSerb nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Serbs, Kosovo is hallowed ground. It is their Holy\r\n\r\nLand.  Kosovo had been\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSerbian  territory as early as in the Middle Ages.  It was  lost\r\n\r\nin  a  humiliating defeat to the invading Ottoman army in  1389.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the  Ottoman conquest, ethnic  Albanians  moved  into\r\n\r\nKosovo,  thereby displacing the Serbs who were of Slavic  stock.\r\n\r\nThe racial composition of Kosovo changed, from majority Serbs to\r\n\r\nmajority  Albanians.  Today, 600 years later,  Serb  nationalism\r\n\r\nhas reared to reclaim Kosovo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that the Serbs would no more think of yielding\r\n\r\nKosovo  to Albanians than Jews of handing over Jerusalem to  the\r\n\r\nPalestinians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Tito's Yugoslavia - Not A Nation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was never a Yugoslavia nation. The break-up of the\r\n\r\nformer  Yugoslavia  illustrates that a  nation  is  not  just  a\r\n\r\ncollection of peoples under a common constitutional framework.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yugoslavia was cobbled together after the Second World War\r\n\r\nin  1945  by  Marshal  Josip Tito.  It comprised  six  republics\r\n\r\n(Serbia,  Croatia, Macedonia, Slovenia, Montenegro  and  Bosnia-Herzegovina) and two autonomous regions (Kosovo and  Vojvodina).\r\n\r\nThe   Serbs,   Croats,  Bosnians,  Slovenes,   Macedonians   and\r\n\r\nMontenegrins came from the same Slavic stock, but they belong to\r\n\r\ndifferent  tribes and backgrounds.  Kosovars are  mostly  ethnic\r\n\r\nAlbanians.  The Albanians and Bosnians are Muslims, while  Serbs\r\n\r\nare mainly orthodox Christians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after Tito died in 1980, Yugoslavia began to\r\n\r\ndisintegrate.   Belgrade  could not hold  the  different  tribes\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open violence broke out. Finally, independence was\r\n\r\ndeclared by Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina,\r\n\r\none after another, between June 1991 and April 1992.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bosnians are Slavs, like the Serbs. But despite this,\r\n\r\nBosnia  fought a war with Serbia from 1991 to 1995,  and  became\r\n\r\nindependent  under the US-brokered Dayton peace  accord.   Islam\r\n\r\ndivides  Bosnians from the Christian Serbs.  The  Bosnians  were\r\n\r\nconverted to Islam in the late Middle Ages by Turkish occupiers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1478</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yugoslavia was not a homogeneous nation. So it broke up\r\n\r\nafter strongman Tito died.  Yugoslavia lasted only 45 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore - Racial Riots</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a homogeneous nation either. However,\r\n\r\nthere  is  one consolation, Singapore is too small to  break  up\r\n\r\ninto two or three separate countries.  But racial riots can tear\r\n\r\nthe country apart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the racial riots broke out in 1964, I had just started\r\n\r\nwork  as  an  Administrative Officer  in  the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nOffice,  then housed in City Hall.  Othman Eusofe, my  colleague\r\n\r\nfrom  Raffles and University, had also just started work in Land\r\n\r\nOffice, also housed in City Hall.  When news of the riots  broke\r\n\r\nout,  the offices were quickly cleared and everyone was told  to\r\n\r\ngo  home immediately.  I went downstairs and met Othman  in  the\r\n\r\nlobby.   Both of us wondered how to get home.  The streets  were\r\n\r\nchaotic with cars and worried people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not know how Othman made his way home. I was then\r\n\r\nliving in a HDB flat in Queenstown.  There was a colleague in my\r\n\r\noffice  who also lived in Queenstown.  We decided to walk  home.\r\n\r\nFortunately for both of us, as we were somewhere  near the  YMCA\r\n\r\nin  Orchard Road, a friend of my colleague came by in  his  car.\r\n\r\nHe gave us both a lift home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that racial riots would never break out again\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   They  could be caused by chauvinistic  leaders.\r\n\r\nThey could be triggered by insensitive handling of racial issues\r\n\r\nby an inept government.  They could be instigated from outside.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we need safeguards such as the Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil  for  Minority Rights, Maintenance of Religious  Harmony\r\n\r\nAct and the Internal Security Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These legal instruments in themselves are useful. They\r\n\r\nhelp   prevent  subversive  and  communalistic  acts.   But   by\r\n\r\nthemselves,  just  these  Acts  alone  do  not  guarantee   that\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  not  be divided along communal  lines.   In  a\r\n\r\ncrunch,  where the interests of the tribe and the state diverge,\r\n\r\ncan we be sure that the sense of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1479</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbelonging  to  a  state  will be stronger  than  the  primordial\r\n\r\ninstinct of belonging to a tribe?  Are Singaporeans of different\r\n\r\nraces prepared to lay down their lives for the sake of Singapore\r\n\r\nif there is a divide amongst the races?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Osborne Wilson, a Professor at Harvard University,\r\n\r\nin his book \"On Human Nature\", observed that, historically, when\r\n\r\nMaoris  fought for land, alliances were based on kinship.   They\r\n\r\nwould  consciously and explicitly expand against the territories\r\n\r\nof  the  groups most distantly related to them.  In other words,\r\n\r\nexpansionist on the basis of how close you are in  kinship.   In\r\n\r\n1837,  when  Hokianga warriors arrived at one fight  already  in\r\n\r\nprogress  between two sections of the Nga Puhi tribe, they  were\r\n\r\nundecided  about which side to join, because they  were  equally\r\n\r\nrelated to both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose it was the same with the Chinese in Singapore\r\n\r\nbefore the Speak Mandarin Campaign.  Those in one dialect  group\r\n\r\nwould instinctively support their own members in a dispute  with\r\n\r\nmembers of another dialect group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we see the same phenomenon in Indonesia. When a\r\n\r\nMadurese  has  a  casual fight with an Ambonese in  Jakarta,  it\r\n\r\nwould soon become a general fight between Madurese and Ambonese.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of belonging to a tribe is most overriding.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore - Serving The Nation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have many pools of DNA. To build a nation\r\n\r\nout  of  these different pools is not easy.  We can never remove\r\n\r\ntotally  the  divide between the different races.   The  Chinese\r\n\r\nwould not want to adopt Malay customs, culture and religion  nor\r\n\r\ndo  Malays  and Indians want to be assimilated by  the  Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe  Eurasians too are happy to be what they are.   But  we  can\r\n\r\nwork to lower the divide.  It is a long process.  It may take us\r\n\r\nat  least  one or two generations before we can confidently  say\r\n\r\nthat  we have built a successful, multi-racial nation where  the\r\n\r\nraces will fight together to advance their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1480</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncollective as well as each other's interests.  It boils down  to\r\n\r\ntrust  -  whether  one  race  trusts  another  to  protect   its\r\n\r\ninterests.  We must try and build up this trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This cannot be done through nice-sounding slogans and\r\n\r\nmotherhood statements.  It will be built only when we have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  fire together, and have helped one another to  survive.\r\n\r\nThe  older  generation of Singaporeans have at least fought  the\r\n\r\ncommunists and communalists together.  They have also fought for\r\n\r\nSingapore's  independence.  The bond between that generation  of\r\n\r\nleaders  and  Singaporeans  is  strong  and  unshakeable.   That\r\n\r\ngeneration also feels an instinctive moral obligation  to  serve\r\n\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the younger generation of Singaporeans have had no\r\n\r\nexperience  of  hardships, let alone racial riots  and  external\r\n\r\nthreats.  Their lives have mostly been plain sailing.  So  their\r\n\r\nbonds to Singapore and their sense of service to the country are\r\n\r\nnot as strong as the older generation's.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tony Tan came back from his recent trip to the US, he\r\n\r\nexplained  to  me why he had proposed tuition loans  instead  of\r\n\r\nscholarships  for our bright students to study abroad.   He  had\r\n\r\nmet  a group of our scholars in Boston.  They peppered him  with\r\n\r\nquestions  on  how  they  could break  their  scholarship  bonds\r\n\r\ninstead  of  how and where they could serve on their  return  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Tony  was  totally  dismayed.   He  proposed   that\r\n\r\nscholarships  be  replaced  with  tuition  loans.   He  was  not\r\n\r\nthinking  of  using  public funds.  He was thinking  that  these\r\n\r\nscholars  would have to borrow from the banks at market interest\r\n\r\nrates.   Then  when  they  come back,  they  can  apply  to  any\r\n\r\norganisation to get a job, and it is up to that organisation  to\r\n\r\ntake  over the loans from the scholars.  So I understood  better\r\n\r\nthe  context of Tony Tan's proposal for tuition loans to replace\r\n\r\nscholarships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, indeed, more and more bright students from Singapore,\r\n\r\nmore  and  more able Singaporeans think of their self-fulfilment\r\n\r\nfirst, there will be no future for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1481</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it is important to do one's PhD to maximise one's\r\n\r\npotential.   The organisation can wait.  Yes, it is important to\r\n\r\ndo  research in a world-class institution.  Singapore can  wait.\r\n\r\nBut  if  most of our ablest think that way, can we ever build  a\r\n\r\nSingapore nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Lee Hsien Loong graduated from Cambridge University,\r\n\r\nhis  professor  encouraged him to stay back to  do  his  PhD  in\r\n\r\nMathematics.  He came back.  He wrote to his professor  that  he\r\n\r\nfelt his country would need his services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too wanted to do my PhD after my graduation in 1964. The\r\n\r\nPSC  would not let me.  I was under a bursary bond.  So I joined\r\n\r\nthe Administrative Service.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, in 1976, the late Hon Sui Sen invited me to stand\r\n\r\nfor election.  I was not a natural politician.  I am still not a\r\n\r\nnatural  politician.  But I felt an obligation to say 'yes'.   I\r\n\r\nhad no political ambition.  But if my country needed me, I could\r\n\r\nnot  say 'no'.  Without the bursaries and scholarships, I  would\r\n\r\nnot have done so well in life.  I felt an instinctive obligation\r\n\r\nto do national service.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore - A Society of Overlapping Circles</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the powerful, emotive statements of Singapore 21.\r\n\r\nI wish to caution, however, against unrealistic expectations and\r\n\r\nquick results.  A strong dose of realism is necessary.  A nation\r\n\r\nis  not built in one generation, much less a country made up  of\r\n\r\ndifferent  races and religions, who until recently, were  living\r\n\r\nin different racial enclaves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically, the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities\r\n\r\nlived  in distinct neighbourhoods.  Even among the Chinese,  the\r\n\r\ndifferent dialect groups had their own cantonments.  So  we  had\r\n\r\nthe  Cantonese  in Kreta Ayer, the Hokkiens in Telok  Ayer,  the\r\n\r\nHainanese  in  Middle  Road,  and the  Teochews  in  Boat  Quay.\r\n\r\nStaying  together according to language, race, religion, dialect\r\n\r\ngroups provided an important security and comfort zone.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1482</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even today, there is still a tendency for racial enclaves\r\n\r\nto  form  in  HDB estates.  Hence, we had to introduce  a  quota\r\n\r\nsystem in 1989 to ensure that every public housing estate  is  a\r\n\r\nmicrocosm of multi-racial Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may use an imagery, our society is made up of\r\n\r\noverlapping  circles, like the People's Association  logo,  four\r\n\r\ncircles  overlapping with one another.  Each  circle  represents\r\n\r\none community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we can do is to maximise the overlapping area of the\r\n\r\nfour circles.  This is the area where all Singaporeans, whatever\r\n\r\ntheir race, work and play together.  It is an open level playing\r\n\r\nfield   with   English  as  the  common  language,   and   equal\r\n\r\nopportunities for all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside this common area, where the circles do not overlap,\r\n\r\neach  community  has its own playing field.   In  this  separate\r\n\r\nplaying  field,  each community can retain  and  speak  its  own\r\n\r\nlanguage  and  practise  its  own  culture  and  customs.   This\r\n\r\npractical  approach of nation-building whereby  every  community\r\n\r\nhas two playing fields has given us multi-racial harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach helps us to build a harmonious nation out of\r\n\r\ndiversity.  But as the divide between races is always there, the\r\n\r\nnational heartbeat may become separate heartbeats over time.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Britain and Canada - Devolution of Powers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me use Britain to illustrate my point. In 1707,\r\n\r\nEngland, Wales and Scotland came together to form Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThey  were  joined by North Ireland in 1801.  After  almost  300\r\n\r\nyears, you would expect Great Britain, the Scots, the Welsh  and\r\n\r\nthe Irish feel more British, and for Britain to become more of a\r\n\r\nBritish nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But till this day, England, Wales, Scotland and North\r\n\r\nIreland  still  field their own teams and compete  against  each\r\n\r\nother   in  the  World  Cup  and  other  international  football\r\n\r\ntournaments.   Each will cheer for its own team, not  the  other\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1483</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tomorrow, 6th of May, the Scots will elect their first\r\n\r\nParliament to sit in Edinburgh in 300 years.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nthe Welsh will be voting for the first elected assembly in their\r\n\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist of 1st May 1999 said,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"These developments do not signal the re-birth of Scotland\r\n\r\nand  Wales  as  independent countries.  But  they  do  signal  a\r\n\r\nhistoric and welcome shift in the way Britain is governed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why should Scotland and Wales want their own\r\n\r\nParliaments if they have become more British?  Can anyone be  so\r\n\r\nsure that devolution of power would not go further and that  100\r\n\r\nyears from now, there would not be an independent Scotland?   Or\r\n\r\nWales?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Canada. The Dominion of Canada was formed in 1867,\r\n\r\nmore  than  130  years  ago.  But many  of  the  French-speaking\r\n\r\nCanadians in Quebec still refuse to identify themselves with the\r\n\r\nEnglish-speaking  Canadians.   Their  ancestors  had  come  from\r\n\r\nFrance,  not  Britain.  Quebec has held two votes on  separation\r\n\r\nfrom Canada to form an independent Quebec.  In the first vote in\r\n\r\n1980,  40% of Quebeckers voted for independence.  In the  second\r\n\r\nvote in 1995, the percentage has risen to 49.6%.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Making Singapore Work</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I come back to the basic point: the tribal instinct and\r\n\r\nshared  DNA  are stronger than the sense of shared future  in  a\r\n\r\ncountry made up of different tribes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must try and make Singapore work, and build a\r\n\r\nSingapore nation.  This is a never-ending challenge.   The  task\r\n\r\nis  not  going to get easier.  In fact, it is going to get  more\r\n\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sustain our economy and to let our society flourish, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  import foreign talents and offer some of them  PR  and\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  Our population will become more cosmopolitan.  The\r\n\r\ncity will become more international.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1484</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcomers every year have to be integrated into our\r\n\r\nsociety.   We  have to create in them the same strong  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging to Singapore as the thorough-bred Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our task of nation building is enormous. But we must\r\n\r\npersevere.   If we do, we can and we will eventually become  one\r\n\r\nfamily, one people, one nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book, \"From Empire to Nation\", Professor Emerson\r\n\r\nalso qualifies a nation as:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"a community of people who feel that they belong together\r\n\r\nin  the double sense that they share deeply significant elements\r\n\r\nof a common heritage and that they have a common destiny for the\r\n\r\nfuture\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, over time, imbue in our diverse population a sense\r\n\r\nof  community,  trust in each other, a commitment to  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  a passion to make it work.  We can maximize the significant\r\n\r\ncommon  elements of our different ancestral heritage as well  as\r\n\r\nour  common  Singapore heritage, and together,  build  a  nation\r\n\r\nwhere  we  will  share  a common destiny.   We  can  create  the\r\n\r\nSingapore tribe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, we have just heard a\r\n\r\nsobering  and  challenging speech from the  Prime  Minister.   I\r\n\r\nagree  fully with PM that for Singapore, it is fundamental  that\r\n\r\nwe have racial harmony, for without racial harmony, we could not\r\n\r\nhave  many of the things that we aspire in Singapore 21.  Racial\r\n\r\nharmony  is  crucial  and all Singaporeans  will  have  to  work\r\n\r\ntowards this in the years ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we enter the next millennium, we will be facing more\r\n\r\ncomplex  issues  which would require us to work  together  as  a\r\n\r\ncohesive  people  to  meet  tougher  competition  from   various\r\n\r\nsocieties which also want to make progress just like  us.    And\r\n\r\nwith  limited resources available, competition will get  tougher\r\n\r\nand  we will have to find a place within this arena.  Unless  we\r\n\r\nconcertedly work as one people, it will be difficult to  improve\r\n\r\nour  quality  of life.  What are some of the crucial  issues  we\r\n\r\nwill be confronting?  I will name a few of them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1486</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>3.35 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will have to meet increasing aspirations of the\r\n\r\nyounger generation of Singaporeans whose life expectations  have\r\n\r\nchanged,  and it is understandable that they aspire  higher  and\r\n\r\nthrough these aspirations, we hope to meet their needs.  Second,\r\n\r\nthe  decline  in  population growth  which  can  slow  down  our\r\n\r\nproductivity,  and  with the greying of our population,  we  are\r\n\r\nbound  to face a slowing down of Singapore and we need  to  find\r\n\r\nways  to  address  this.   Third, the  value  conflicts  between\r\n\r\nindividual   needs   and   collective   interests   leading   to\r\n\r\nindividualism is one of the issues which we need to take note of\r\n\r\nand  to  find ways to tackle.  Fourth, the displacement  of  the\r\n\r\nless  skilled and able from the job market because of relocation\r\n\r\nof  the labour intensive industries.  Fifth, the emergence of  a\r\n\r\nnew  under-class who may feel that they have problems of  access\r\n\r\nto  education,  health and housing and our  related  provisions.\r\n\r\nSixth,  under-achievement can be wrongly tied up with  language,\r\n\r\nreligion and race.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take three major critical issues for us to\r\n\r\nponder  and to see how we can find new strategies to meet  these\r\n\r\nchallenges.  First, the danger of a growing social gap.  In  the\r\n\r\nlast  decade,  we  have  witnessed the restructuring  of  social\r\n\r\nservice  provisions.  Although the whole objective  is  to  make\r\n\r\nservices  more  efficient and to reduce  waste,  such  a  policy\r\n\r\ndirection  will  be  effective only  if  the  provisions  remain\r\n\r\naffordable and accessible.  Sir, the danger is that these  basic\r\n\r\nprovisions will become more expensive and hence may  be  out  of\r\n\r\nreach to the working-class.  It is therefore important that such\r\n\r\na   run-away  increase  can  be  moderated  and  public  service\r\n\r\nmonopolies  should be checked to ensure that their  charges  are\r\n\r\nreasonable.   In this respect, Sir, the move towards  knowledge-based economy must be planned in such a way that the adults  and\r\n\r\nchildren  of  working-class families can also benefit  from  it.\r\n\r\nEducational  facilities and training should be both  accessible.\r\n\r\nVarious  steps must be taken by Government and other  bodies  to\r\n\r\nensure that they\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1487</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  an  opportunity, like others who are better off,  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the knowledge-based training right from  a  young\r\n\r\nage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave the training and education of the young working-class to the dictates of the market will in the long run cause\r\n\r\nsocial  divide and thus marginalise the less well-off sector  of\r\n\r\nour society.  Translated in real economic terms, the less better\r\n\r\noff  sector  will have less opportunity to move up the  economic\r\n\r\nladder.  We should seriously look at this to see what we can  do\r\n\r\nto  ensure that there is an opportunity for upward mobility  for\r\n\r\npeople  at  the  lower rung of the society.   They  will  remain\r\n\r\neconomically trapped.  In short, the glass ceiling effect  would\r\n\r\nbe  prevalent  and this will make our society less permeable  to\r\n\r\nthose  at the bottom of the ladder.  This can become the  social\r\n\r\nvirus which can affect the social health of our society.  If  we\r\n\r\nare not careful, the gaps between the better-off and less better-off  can widen and such a state will not be helpful to community\r\n\r\nbuilding.   I  feel that in such a circumstance, the  Government\r\n\r\nmust  intercede and mediate to deploy resources for them so that\r\n\r\nthey  would have a chance to make progress in their life.   This\r\n\r\nis  tremendously important, particularly where we have  a  large\r\n\r\nworking-class base.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the effects of individualism versus\r\n\r\ncollectivism,  I would like to make the following  observations.\r\n\r\nWe  have  witnessed the consequences of the promotion of extreme\r\n\r\nindividualism  in  some developed countries.  In  these  places,\r\n\r\nindividual needs override group needs.  The collective  interest\r\n\r\nof  the  group  is set aside.  The `me first and others  second'\r\n\r\ntype  of  mentality  has  created  serious  problems  for  their\r\n\r\nsocieties.   Many  self-interest groups  are  formed  with  each\r\n\r\nhaving  their own agenda and jockeying for power and  resources.\r\n\r\nThe  law  of  the  jungle  prevails  and  the  fittest  survive.\r\n\r\nDecision-making  becomes  too  problematic  and  in   the   end,\r\n\r\nsocieties  suffer because of protracted conflicts.   People  are\r\n\r\nafraid  to do the right things that work.  I am sure we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  Singapore to move in this direction, for  if  we  do,  our\r\n\r\nsociety will be easily fractured,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1488</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas   we  are  more  vulnerable  to  the  pulls  of  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsentiments.   So,  the practice of merit-based rewards  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  good approach in our public policy must continue  to  be\r\n\r\npursued  by us without compromise.  This is fundamental  for  us\r\n\r\nand  merit  is the basis by which we work.  We are subjected  to\r\n\r\nthis  tremendous  pull  and push from various  quarters  in  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  and  pandering to group and racial  sentiments  would\r\n\r\nlead to a divided society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, the question of race, language and religion.\r\n\r\nFailure  could  be fudged in the context of race,  language  and\r\n\r\nreligion.  We  must be mindful and always be on the  guard  from\r\n\r\ntime to time on the question of race, language, and religion  as\r\n\r\nthis  will  always be used as an excuse for one's or  a  group's\r\n\r\nfailure.  This is also very relevant to Singapore itself because\r\n\r\nwe  are  a  multi-racial  society, and hence  we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nappreciate the underpinnings of these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I see it, one's ethnic background, be it Chinese, Indian\r\n\r\nor Malay, could be advanced as the cause of one's low station in\r\n\r\nlife  and  poor performance, and that is a danger  that  I  see.\r\n\r\nThis is a very tempting reason, especially in Singapore's multi-racial  society  where Indians and Malays  are  the  minorities.\r\n\r\nOnce  primordial sentiments are excited, it could lead to racial\r\n\r\nprejudice  and dissension.  That will spell trouble for  all  of\r\n\r\nus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is fundamental that we make sure that every\r\n\r\nSingaporean,  irrespective  of his background,  be  given  equal\r\n\r\naccess and opportunity to social provisions which will help  him\r\n\r\nto  develop his potentials to his fullest.  I think this is very\r\n\r\nimportant for Singapore, particularly in a multi-racial society.\r\n\r\nInstitutions and organisations must be seen above board and they\r\n\r\nmust  have tremendous integrity in its delivery of services  and\r\n\r\nthat  they are seen to respond on a fair and just basis  without\r\n\r\nprejudice  towards different ethnic groups.  That is a challenge\r\n\r\nfor  the  various social institutions that we have in Singapore.\r\n\r\nInstitutions must be managed by people with integrity, who  mean\r\n\r\ngood  for  Singapore  and unless and until  we  have  people  of\r\n\r\nintegrity  in  the  various  social  institutions  and  who  are\r\n\r\nconscious of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1489</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbackdrop  and  problems that our PM has mentioned just  now,  we\r\n\r\nwill  have a divided Singapore and that in the long run will  be\r\n\r\nworse  for all of us.  We will be no better.  Therefore, in  the\r\n\r\ncontext of Singapore, we must ensure that we work towards ethnic\r\n\r\nharmony,   religious  tolerance,  appreciate  one   another   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, and collectively work for a common purpose so that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be  able to survive and manage.   And  that  is\r\n\r\nindeed the challenge for all of us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I first congratulate whoever put\r\n\r\ntogether  this  Report  on the attractive  dressing  up  of  the\r\n\r\nReport.   We  have become accustomed in Singapore to the  public\r\n\r\nrelations job that the Government is so competent at.  But  that\r\n\r\nis  about all that I can find to commend in this Report.   I  am\r\n\r\nsorry  if  I  take a view which is at odds with almost  all  the\r\n\r\nother  speakers.   But  I have to say what  I  feel  about  this\r\n\r\nReport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Report abounds in platitudes and it echoes what\r\n\r\nwe  have  heard  from  our leaders in the Government  all  these\r\n\r\nyears.   That is not surprising if one looks at the  members  of\r\n\r\nthe  various committees.  The co-chairmen are all members of the\r\n\r\nruling  party  except for two who are nominated  by  the  ruling\r\n\r\nparty.  It is no wonder that ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Member if I may have the\r\n\r\nfloor to clarify a point?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Do you want to give way, Mr Jeyaretnam?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> No, I am not. So it is not surprising that\r\n\r\nit  should echo what we have heard all these years.  I have  not\r\n\r\nhad  the time to go through this Report from cover to cover.   I\r\n\r\nhave  been away. But from what little I have read of it,  I  can\r\n\r\nfind  no  mention of the term \"an open society\" as  a  desirable\r\n\r\ngoal  for Singapore, and yet this was the vision of our  present\r\n\r\nSenior Minister when he was speaking in the Malaysian Parliament\r\n\r\nat  the  end  of  1964.  To him, an open society was  absolutely\r\n\r\nessential for the progress of the nation, and yet today planning\r\n\r\nour vision for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1490</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnext century, there is no mention of an open society as being an\r\n\r\nessential need for our nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that it abounds in platitudes. But may I first\r\n\r\nsay  a  little  bit about the way this Report has  been  brought\r\n\r\nabout.   The  Minister, in his opening statement in  moving  the\r\n\r\nmotion,  said  that the task of the Committee was to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  heartware  of Singapore and to develop a consensus  on  the\r\n\r\nkind of society which Singaporeans want for the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, how do we develop a consensus on\r\n\r\nthe kind of society which Singaporeans want for the future?  One\r\n\r\nwould  have  thought one could only develop a  consensus  if  we\r\n\r\ninvited  Singaporeans  to  enter  into  public  discussions  and\r\n\r\ndebates  on the values and goals of the society that  they  live\r\n\r\nin.   One Nominated Member talked about public discussions  that\r\n\r\nhave  gone  into it.  I cannot recall any public discussions  on\r\n\r\nS21.   Were  there any meetings called for the public to  attend\r\n\r\nand to take part in formulating what the goals and values of the\r\n\r\nsociety  should be?  Nothing at all.  It is said that  views  of\r\n\r\n6,000 people were sought, but I see that they included community\r\n\r\nleaders and others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And Low Thia Khiang!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I cannot find Low Thia Khiang's name in the\r\n\r\nCommittee's Report as one of the members of any Committee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to know what the vision should be, we should get\r\n\r\ndown  to  the man in the street.  We should ask him what  is  it\r\n\r\nthat he values as a goal for the society.  We may not agree with\r\n\r\nhim  but  we at least give him a chance to speak.  And  that  is\r\n\r\nwhat  Mr Lee, I think, was trying to encourage when he urged  an\r\n\r\nopen society in 1964.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in his speech, the Minister talks about the five key\r\n\r\nideas  and says every Singaporean matters.   I say amen to that.\r\n\r\nIf  every  Singaporean matters, then the views and  opinions  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans should be sought publicly and openly, and this  was\r\n\r\nnever done.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1491</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would commend to the Government - I am sure they must\r\n\r\nhave  read  it  -  an article that appeared in the UK  magazine,\r\n\r\nThe  Economist,  17th April this year.  The  article  is  headed\r\n\r\n\"Happiness is a Warm Vote\".  It reports on a survey carried  out\r\n\r\nin Switzerland by two members of the University of Zurich.  They\r\n\r\nasked the residents how satisfied they were with their life as a\r\n\r\nwhole.   The results apparently showed up some revealing things,\r\n\r\nand  it  showed  that  the  people who were  given  more  direct\r\n\r\nparticipation  -  they call it direct democracy  -   in  shaping\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of the country were much happier than  those  who\r\n\r\nwere  given  less participation.  It is not that in  Switzerland\r\n\r\nthat  they are not given, but apparently direct democracy varies\r\n\r\nfrom  one  canton to another.  In some cantons, they  have  more\r\n\r\ndirect  participation.  And it was found  that  they  were  much\r\n\r\nhappier  than  people in other cantons.  The  article  ends,  \"A\r\n\r\nhappy  country  it seems is one where politics  is  not  just  a\r\n\r\nspectator sport.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the lesson that one can learn from this survey is that\r\n\r\nif we wish to motivate our citizens, if we wish to drive them to\r\n\r\ngreater   heights,  then  we  should  give  them   more   direct\r\n\r\nparticipation  in the policy making.  And, of  course,  we  know\r\n\r\nthat in Switzerland, they have a referendum for almost every new\r\n\r\nlaw  that  they wish to pass or make any changes.  The  citizens\r\n\r\nfeel  that they are part of the country and they are asked their\r\n\r\nviews on what should be done for the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report reproduces part of the Prime Minister's speech\r\n\r\nat  the National Day Rally in 1996, where the Prime Minister  is\r\n\r\nreported to have said, \"I say to all Singaporeans, you  have  to\r\n\r\nfeel  passionately  about Singapore.  Being Singaporeans  should\r\n\r\nresonate  in  our hearts and minds.\"  May I ask, when  does  one\r\n\r\nfeel  passionate about anything?  Does one feel passionate  when\r\n\r\none has had no hand in the creation of something of which one is\r\n\r\nasked  to feel passionate, if one is made to feel that he is  an\r\n\r\noutsider,  he  has got nothing to do with the creation  of  that\r\n\r\nthing?  Or does he feel passionate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1492</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhen  he  is invited to work together to create whatever  he  is\r\n\r\nasked  to  feel  passionate about?  I should  have  thought  the\r\n\r\nanswer was obvious.   Singaporeans would feel passionate if they\r\n\r\nfelt that they were being consulted, they were being listened to\r\n\r\nand they were being given a hand in formulating the policies and\r\n\r\ngoals for this society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another statement in this Report that I found amusing was\r\n\r\nthat it says that Singaporeans must all put on our thinking caps\r\n\r\ntogether to find answers.  This is all, as I said, great  words.\r\n\r\nBut  the Report is abysmally silent on how we reach these goals.\r\n\r\nHow  do  we get Singaporeans to feel passionate about Singapore?\r\n\r\nHow  do we get Singaporeans to find answers collectively to  the\r\n\r\nproblems  of  the country?    The Report is a complete  silence.\r\n\r\nAnd  then  it  says  again  somewhere, \"we  must  become  active\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are participants, not mere observers  in  building\r\n\r\nthe Singapore we want for the future.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we agree. But what do we propose should be done to\r\n\r\nmake  Singaporeans  become  active  citizens,  participants,  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  the  society we want for the future?  One  would  have\r\n\r\nexpected all that in this Report, but there is nothing in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have, in this House, moved a\r\n\r\nnumber  of motions, attempting to place before the House what  I\r\n\r\nthought  were necessary for Singapore's progress into  the  21st\r\n\r\ncentury.   One  of these was my motion on the removal  of  fear.\r\n\r\nYou  cannot,  Mr  Deputy  Speaker, just poo-poo  the  idea  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  are  living  in  fear.   It  is  a  reality.   One\r\n\r\nencounters  it everywhere.  And unless this fear is removed  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  goes  about  it deliberately  to  remove  the  fear,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  will  not  participate actively  in  building  the\r\n\r\nsociety.  Singaporeans will not feel passionate about the  goals\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has laid out for them.   The Minister  says\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  21  is  not a Government  concept.   I  beg  to\r\n\r\ndisagree.  It reads very much like what the Government wants the\r\n\r\npeople  to be.  It is social engineering all over again  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety  for  the  21st  century.  It does  not  come  from  the\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1493</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it would appear that the rule is: you can\r\n\r\nonly  participate within the parameters that we lay  down,  that\r\n\r\nis,  the  Government, the ruling Party, lays down.  If you  step\r\n\r\noutside   the  parameters,  then,  you  suffer;  you   pay   the\r\n\r\nconsequences for that.  Can you get Singaporeans to be  involved\r\n\r\nand participate actively if that is the rule?  Yes, you will get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are only anxious to make their  own  progress\r\n\r\njoining  in.  But Singaporeans who feel passionately  about  the\r\n\r\ngoals  and values will not join in if they are told this is  it,\r\n\r\nthese are the four lines, and you must work within it.  No self-respecting person will want to come into that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, from experience that I\r\n\r\nhave  found  from the time I went into politics  in  1971.   The\r\n\r\nOpposition  have  been made to feel that they had  no  place  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, they were not Singaporeans, they were the enemies  of\r\n\r\nthe  people.   When I was in Parliament in 1981 to 1986,  I  was\r\n\r\ntold  by  the present Senior Minister, then the Prime  Minister,\r\n\r\nthat I had to be destroyed because I was against the system.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the question is: what was the system that I was against?\r\n\r\nIt was not the democratic system.  I was against the system that\r\n\r\nwas operating in Singapore.  So this is it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, and it has been over the last 40 years,\r\n\r\nanyone  who gets out of the line, steps out, is dealt with  very\r\n\r\nharshly.   It would appear that loyalty to Singapore is  equated\r\n\r\nwith  loyalty  to  the  Government and to  the  PAP.   But  that\r\n\r\nconception has to be erased completely.  People have to be  told\r\n\r\nquite  deliberately that loyalty to Singapore can mean, and  may\r\n\r\nmean, at times differing from whatever the Government puts up as\r\n\r\nthe  goal or policy for Singapore and they would be allowed  and\r\n\r\ngiven  every  opportunity to voice their  views.   That  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  in Singapore.  So I do not know how we can talk  about\r\n\r\nthe  vision for the next century or the next millennium  without\r\n\r\nfirst freeing our people from the straitjackets into which  they\r\n\r\nhave been put.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have got to loosen up, and that has no place in this\r\n\r\nreport at all.  We should\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1494</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nallow  public meetings.  We should not prosecute any  Opposition\r\n\r\npolitician  because he seeks to address Singaporeans  on  issues\r\n\r\nthat  concern  them, because he has not got a  permit  from  the\r\n\r\nPolice.   If that is how Singapore is going to be run,  then  we\r\n\r\nare  never  going  to  get  Singaporeans  feeling  passionately,\r\n\r\nbecoming active participants and deciding on the goals.  We must\r\n\r\nremove  them  from being just passive spectators, unable  to  do\r\n\r\nanything  about deciding the country's policies and its  future,\r\n\r\ninto  people who feel that they are active players and they  can\r\n\r\nonly  do this if you remove all the restraints.  If you do  not,\r\n\r\nwe  will  continue as we have over the last 45 years,  and  this\r\n\r\ntalk  about  the  vision for Singapore 21st  century  will  only\r\n\r\nremain  as mere words, platitudes with no political will on  the\r\n\r\npart of the Government to bring it into reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, what the Prime Minister said just now  was\r\n\r\nvery touching indeed.  I  agree wholeheartedly with what he  has\r\n\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five ideas of the Singapore 21 Vision are great ideas\r\n\r\nthat  will  guide  us  into the 21st century  with  a  strategic\r\n\r\ndirection.   They  represent the values of the  individual,  the\r\n\r\nfamily, society and the country.  It is like a compass that will\r\n\r\nguide our people of different races to work together to give  of\r\n\r\ntheir  best, to go through weal and woe to build good homes  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  To do this, we must try to put these  five  ideas\r\n\r\ninto simple language to inculcate in the minds of our people  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can all remember these ideals and translate them  into\r\n\r\naction and reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the five ideas of S21 Vision, I would suggest 20\r\n\r\nsimple  Chinese characters to summarise them and  highlight  the\r\n\r\ncommon  goals  that  we  have worked out for  ourselves  and  to\r\n\r\ninspire  every citizen to participate in our efforts to  realize\r\n\r\nthese  ideas. These Chinese characters are: quanmin heyi, baojia\r\n\r\nguben,  zhongzhi chengcheng, zhanchi weiguo, gongquang  yuanjin,\r\n\r\nmeaning \"the entire people united as one, maintain\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1495</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  strong family as a foundation, unity is strength, spread  our\r\n\r\nwings for the nation, together we create our vision.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is often said that \"Heaven has its purpose for every\r\n\r\nperson  who is born on earth\". That is to say, every  one  is  a\r\n\r\ntalent.   To realize the much-esteemed personal values, we  must\r\n\r\npersevere   in  continuously  upgrading  the  intellectual   and\r\n\r\neducational   level  of  our  people  so  that  every   citizen,\r\n\r\nirrespective of race or station in life, will give full play  to\r\n\r\nhis talent and give of his best to contribute to society and the\r\n\r\nnation.   To  put  it simply, we aim to have the  entire  people\r\n\r\nunited  as  one  (quanmin  heyi) to  achieve  a  prosperous  and\r\n\r\npeaceful Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cohesive family is the foundation stone on which the\r\n\r\nnation  is built. To put it simply, we must have strong families\r\n\r\nas  our  foundation.  Family is not only the foundation  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry  but  also a strong spiritual pillar for the individual.\r\n\r\nWhenever we are faced with a crisis or in difficulty, the  first\r\n\r\nthing that we think of is the home, the family.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nfamily  or  home is not only our residence but also our  shelter\r\n\r\nand a place for us to rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also frequently say that \"When a family is in harmony,\r\n\r\neverything can be done well\".  That is to say, the family is the\r\n\r\ncore  on  which the bonding is maintained.  It is the basis  for\r\n\r\nour  survival.  It is also the motivating force for our success.\r\n\r\nWhen we are faced with all the future challenges and changes  in\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  we  must  maintain  a  strong  family   as   our\r\n\r\nfoundation  (baojia  guben), as our  unshakeable  conviction  to\r\n\r\nenhance cohesion in attaining our ideal goals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, opportunities do not come from thin air. Rather,\r\n\r\nthey  are  the result of tons of hard work.  There is  a  famous\r\n\r\nHokkien  saying to the effect that we must slog it out in  order\r\n\r\nto  win.   That is a successful motto for many business  people.\r\n\r\nBut  if you want to attain the ideal state in which everyone  is\r\n\r\ngiven  the opportunities in the highly competitive 21st century,\r\n\r\ndepending only on individual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1496</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nefforts is not enough.  As the Prime Minister has said, we  want\r\n\r\nto  turn  Singapore into a combination of the  individuals,  the\r\n\r\nhuman  resource,  the  thinking  and  other  resources  to  turn\r\n\r\nSingapore  into  an international metropolis.  In  other  words,\r\n\r\nwhat  we want is a dynamic first-class and creative city of  the\r\n\r\nworld.  It is only in such a city that everyone and every talent\r\n\r\nwill  have  the opportunity to give full play to his  potential.\r\n\r\nWhether we can realise this idea or not, I think the part played\r\n\r\nby the Government is very crucial.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in some countries where those in power are\r\n\r\narrogant,  narrow-minded and very exclusive, public  opinion  is\r\n\r\nnever  taken  into account when policies are implemented.   Then\r\n\r\nthe intellectual and the wise, whether at home or overseas, will\r\n\r\ndistance  themselves  from  the tyrannic  government.   In  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  whatever dreams you may have  will  remain  just\r\n\r\ndreams.   There is no chance of these dreams becoming a reality.\r\n\r\nAlthough  this  is  not the style of the present  Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, we must remain very vigilant to ensure that the  high\r\n\r\nofficials who are over-ambitious and impatient do not have  this\r\n\r\nkind of a problem and completely disregard consultation with the\r\n\r\npeople.  Otherwise, we will be sowing the seed of evil  and  the\r\n\r\npeople's heart will be lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all along I endorse the\r\n\r\nGovernment's   decisiveness  and   high   efficiency   for   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our economy, culture and  education.  But when we\r\n\r\nare evolving into a knowledge-based economy of the 21st century,\r\n\r\nif  we  depend only on the Government or the few elites  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment service, we will not be able to handle the  excessive\r\n\r\ninformation explosion in this IT age.  Therefore, the Government\r\n\r\nmust  adopt  a more open attitude and maintain closer  relations\r\n\r\nwith  the civic organisations in order to get more reliable  and\r\n\r\nmore accurate information and also constructive opinions for the\r\n\r\nformulation  of  state  policies as points  of  references.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  as  citizens, we will also benefit from the enlightened\r\n\r\npolicies of the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the sake of national interest, we should also support\r\n\r\nthe Government in its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1497</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeritocractic  approach.   We should not  only  welcome  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent, but  also share our experience and knowledge with  them.\r\n\r\nThis  will also enhance our expertise and skills. If we can pull\r\n\r\nthe  collective wisdom and strength of all the people  together,\r\n\r\nwe  will be able to realise our ambition and vision, and this is\r\n\r\nthe meaning of \"unity is strength\" (zhongzhi chengcheng).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that Singapore has many citizens who are\r\n\r\ncurrently   working   overseas  under  the  regionalisation   or\r\n\r\nglobalisation initiatives, or studying for higher degrees.  This\r\n\r\nis  to ensure that they can have better lives for themselves and\r\n\r\ntheir  family,   and  to  become  outstanding  citizens  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.   So a good man shall cherish high ideals to reach  out\r\n\r\nto  the world.  This is a very true statement.  Being physically\r\n\r\noutside  Singapore, it is inevitable that they may  be  somewhat\r\n\r\ndissociated   from  their  homeland.   However,   so   long   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the young ones, can feel the esteem and\r\n\r\nconcern of the country for them, and can always keep in mind the\r\n\r\nmotto  of \"spreading our wings for the nation\" (zhanchi weiguo),\r\n\r\ntheir hearts will always be with Singapore - our homeland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to encourage our people to manifest\r\n\r\ntheir  spirit of active participation, we have to take care  not\r\n\r\nto  induce  them  to  follow blindly, to   participate  in  some\r\n\r\nmeaningless  controversial arguments or to do things  which  may\r\n\r\nundermine our national unity and racial harmony. Our idea is  to\r\n\r\ncreate a good vision for ourselves through collective wisdom and\r\n\r\ncollective efforts.  What we should stress is to encourage every\r\n\r\ncitizen  to  take  part  actively in community  development  and\r\n\r\nwelfare  work.   Our  common goal is to create  our  own  vision\r\n\r\ntogether (gongquang yuanjin).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to realise the ideals of S21 is an ongoing heartware\r\n\r\nproject.   Therefore, we should use our \"heart\" to  realise  the\r\n\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) we must work wholeheartedly as a united people for the\r\n\r\nnation;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) we must have a loving and caring heart to ensure family\r\n\r\ncohesion;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1498</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) we must have an enthusiastic heart to deal with people\r\n\r\nand to create the collective will to build a world city;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) we must have a loyal heart to the nation, then we will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to extend our will beyond the boundary of our country;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) we must have a persevering heart to ensure that we are\r\n\r\nable  to  give  full play to collective wisdom  and  efforts  to\r\n\r\ncreate this common vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that my humble suggestions will stimulate and\r\n\r\nencourage  more views and opinions on this subject  so  that  we\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to translate these ideals into a simple  language\r\n\r\nfor  all  to remember easily and for all to realise  it  in  due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion standing in the name of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David T.

The Prime Minister had taken the trouble  to  read\r\n\r\nthe S21 Report from cover to cover.  Not only that, he had taken\r\n\r\nthe time to reflect on its import and messages.  He came to this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  he  encouraged us but at the same time cautioned  us\r\n\r\nthat  there  are  still  forces within  our  society,  from  our\r\n\r\nheritage, from our history that can divide and break us up.  But\r\n\r\nhe  ended  with  an encouraging word that if we  concentrate  on\r\n\r\nthose  overlapping circles and shared interests, we can build  a\r\n\r\nnation out of a country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I contrast this with the remarks by Mr J.

And the irony of it is that he admits that  he\r\n\r\nhas  not yet read the Report but has only taken a glance at  it.\r\n\r\nHe  reminds me of what a consultant once told me about why  some\r\n\r\nmeetings  are not productive.  And he says that when you  go  to\r\n\r\nsuch meetings, there are only two kinds of people, those who are\r\n\r\ntalking and those who are waiting to talk.

It is a pity\r\n\r\nthat  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam is not here.  Otherwise, he could make\r\n\r\nhis clarification.  Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam's main point is that  we\r\n\r\ndo not have an open society in Singapore.  He complains that the\r\n\r\nopposition  politicians  cannot speak  without  a  permit.   But\r\n\r\nearlier  this afternoon, during the Question time, I thought  he\r\n\r\ndistinctly said that we should make sure that we enforce the law\r\n\r\nso that people will not have disrespect for the law.  It puzzles\r\n\r\nme  as  to what he is now advocating, whether he advocates  that\r\n\r\nopposition  politicians should be given special  differentiation\r\n\r\nto  disregard the law or whether he encourages them to  wilfully\r\n\r\ndisobey  the law because that is the model of the opposition  he\r\n\r\nadvocates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam says that the Report is full of\r\n\r\nplatitudes.   Indeed, if we all adopted his attitude,  it  would\r\n\r\nonly  be just that.  If we read this Report and do nothing about\r\n\r\nthe  ideas  in them, then all these statements will be lifeless.\r\n\r\nThey  would just be slogans that all of us would know about  but\r\n\r\nnone of us would care much about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if we act on these ideas, then they will come alive.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for us is that every Singaporean must examine each\r\n\r\ngoal, and ask ourselves whether we truly believe what is written\r\n\r\nin this Report.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1500</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen  we  say that every Singaporean matters, if we believe  it,\r\n\r\nwill we change our behaviour towards others?  If we say that  we\r\n\r\nwant  strong  families, will we set time aside, as Mr  Seng  Han\r\n\r\nThong does every year, to go for holidays with his family?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect of our vision is about making Singapore a centre\r\n\r\nof  opportunity.   We  have to act on this  too  to  make  it  a\r\n\r\nreality.  At this juncture, what I would like to do is to take a\r\n\r\npause  and just thank all the members of my subject committee  - it  was  a committee on attracting talents versus looking  after\r\n\r\nthe needs of Singaporeans - and all the people in Singapore that\r\n\r\nwe  met  and  talked with.  It was a privilege for Mr  Seng  Han\r\n\r\nThong  and  myself to have led the discussions and to have  been\r\n\r\neducated in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in practical terms, being a centre of opportunity\r\n\r\nmeans making Singapore a place where every Singaporean can  have\r\n\r\na  good job, and do and enjoy the things he treasures the  most.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the  practical way to give meaning to  our  belief  that\r\n\r\neverybody matters and everyone makes a contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But jobs and opportunities do not fall from the sky. We\r\n\r\nhave  to  make them happen.  Good jobs are created  by  talented\r\n\r\npeople.   But the best of our talents are mobile.  If there  are\r\n\r\nno  opportunities here, they will seek opportunities  elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd if they go, who will be left to create the opportunities  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is a circular cost and effect. If we get it wrong,\r\n\r\nit  will be a downward spiral.  But if we get it right, then  we\r\n\r\ncan  create  good jobs in Singapore.  Our talented  people  will\r\n\r\nstay and they will create even better jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get it right, we must be able to keep pace with the rest\r\n\r\nof the world as it races along.  We cannot do this alone.  As  a\r\n\r\nsmall  country, we will always have the problem  of  not  having\r\n\r\nenough people to go around in every sector of the economy.  From\r\n\r\nbiochemists to bankers - we simply do not have the critical mass\r\n\r\nto be self-sustaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1501</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chuang Shaw Peng pointed out earlier this afternoon that\r\n\r\neven  in  America,  with  260 million  people,  they  are  self-sustaining  in  talent.  If we go to the Silicon Valley  or  the\r\n\r\nBoston Belt, we will find that not every talent there is made in\r\n\r\nAmerica, but they come from all four corners of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to succeed, we must maintain a porous border which\r\n\r\nallows talent to flow freely in.  Yes, they will come to tap the\r\n\r\nopportunities  which we offer.  But in that process,  they  will\r\n\r\ncreate even more opportunities for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that from the newspaper reports, TV shows and\r\n\r\nradio  phone-ins,  most  Singaporeans  support  this  policy  of\r\n\r\nattracting  foreign talents.  This House has also  debated  this\r\n\r\nissue  in the past, and I am glad to see that we are all of  one\r\n\r\nmind  on this issue.  But there are still many Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nstill have doubts on how we should go about doing this.  We must\r\n\r\nlay these doubts to rest so that we can get on with the task  of\r\n\r\nbuilding our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doubt whether the people who come to Singapore are\r\n\r\nreal  talents.  Others question whether there is fair  play,  if\r\n\r\nPRs  do  not have to do national service.  Such doubts  are  not\r\n\r\nunexpected.   Fairness is important.  We opened up this  subject\r\n\r\nperhaps  at the worst possible time when we are in the midst  of\r\n\r\nan  economic  crisis and rising unemployment.  So  we  can  well\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  emotions  which  welled  up  and  the  personal\r\n\r\ninterest that participants took in the subject matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it would be wrong to let our emotions overplay such\r\n\r\ndoubts.  There are controls and safeguards in place through  our\r\n\r\nemployment  permit  system.  And we must recognise  that  market\r\n\r\nforces  will  always check potential abuses.  Private  employers\r\n\r\nwill not hire people who have no talent and who create no value.\r\n\r\nFor  them, the issue is not foreign or local, but who can do the\r\n\r\njob, and who can create more value for the price paid?  The best\r\n\r\nman or woman gets the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I did a radio phone-in session a couple of weeks ago,\r\n\r\na lady called up.  She\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1502</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsaid  she was a hairdresser and she was being pushed out of  the\r\n\r\nmarket  by  cheap imports from neighbouring countries.   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nhave  been to the same hairdresser for the last eight years.   I\r\n\r\nhave  never  quarrelled with her over the price she  charges  me\r\n\r\nand,  in fact, I often tip her.  She knows every bristle  on  my\r\n\r\nhead.   She  knows exactly how I want it cut and she  will  stay\r\n\r\nlate,  if I am running late that particular day, just to cut  my\r\n\r\nhair.   She  gives me service and she beats out all the  foreign\r\n\r\ncompetition.  This is the way we must move ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the common misconception that PRs are not required\r\n\r\nto  do  national  service, this is not so.  Yes,  for  practical\r\n\r\nreasons, first generation PRs are often exempted from NS, mostly\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their age, and the impracticality of training  them\r\n\r\ntogether with 18 year olds.  It is a bit hard for a 40-year old,\r\n\r\na bit heavy in the middle to keep up with the younger ones.  But\r\n\r\ntheir male children, the second generation PRs are not exempt.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final protest against foreign talent is that immigrants\r\n\r\nmake us work harder.  They are the cause of our lost dream.  The\r\n\r\nbetter life we thought we would enjoy at the turn of the century\r\n\r\nseems  to  have  faded away.  We cannot relax, we  cannot  enjoy\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these feelings may be real, but the logic is false.\r\n\r\nImmigrants are not the reason why we have to work hard.   It  is\r\n\r\nthe global economy.  We compete, or we fall away.  But our dream\r\n\r\nis  not dead.  We can still find fulfilment and satisfaction  in\r\n\r\nlife,  if  we  work hard, if we work smart, and we  broaden  the\r\n\r\ndefinition of success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, blaming our problems on others would not solve\r\n\r\nit.  If we lose out on a promotion, is it because the other chap\r\n\r\nis  foreign,  or  because he is better?  Competition  cannot  be\r\n\r\navoided.   It  is better that they are here to compete  with  us\r\n\r\nthan  somewhere  else competing against us.  It is  better  that\r\n\r\nthey are here to help us build new capability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basis of competition has changed. There is a\r\n\r\npowerful new trend\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1503</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhich we must recognise.  And to see this, we need to go back  a\r\n\r\nchapter  in  our  history.  In the 60s, many  newly  independent\r\n\r\ncountries  had  a  sense  of new found  pride  and  nationalism.\r\n\r\nThinking  that they had come of age, they raised tariff barriers\r\n\r\nand locked out the foreign investors.  They thought by doing so,\r\n\r\nthey  would protect the infant industries.  The result was  that\r\n\r\nthey lost out on investments and their growth was slow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore did the reverse. We removed all barriers and we\r\n\r\neven  gave  incentives for foreign investors to put their  money\r\n\r\nhere  in  Singapore.   At that time, we were  called  names.   I\r\n\r\nremember  as a young student in Australia, and this was  already\r\n\r\ninto  the  early  70s,  receiving  pamphlets  saying  that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government was exploiting its people,  that  we  were\r\n\r\nselling  out to the big businesses and that we were prostituting\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore.  They called us stooges, lackeys,  all\r\n\r\nkinds  of  names.  But the result was growth and prosperity  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and for Singapore companies.  Our local  companies\r\n\r\ntoday,  local  successes like Serial Systems,  JIT  Electronics,\r\n\r\nYCH,  would  not be around today without the MNCs, without  IBM,\r\n\r\nwithout  Motorola, without DuPont, without these large companies\r\n\r\ncreating  the  baseload for their enterprise to  flourish.   But\r\n\r\nthose countries which shut out MNCs lost out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the same pattern is repeating itself. Only this\r\n\r\ntime,  the  issue is not investments but talent.  Some countries\r\n\r\nare  shutting their doors to talents, thinking that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nbetter  way  to  protect the jobs of their citizens.   They  are\r\n\r\nwrong.  We must not fall into this trap.  We continue to attract\r\n\r\nMNCs  to  Singapore  today because they  can  bring  the  needed\r\n\r\ntalents  to create new activities in Singapore.  If we shut  out\r\n\r\ntheir  talents,  their ability to hire the  right  people,  they\r\n\r\nwould  go elsewhere and we would lose out a whole generation  of\r\n\r\ngrowth.  That is something that we might never survive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth for Singapore is that we must always compete to\r\n\r\nsucceed and compete\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1504</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe can.  We heard on May Day from Mr Lim Boon Heng that BERI and\r\n\r\nother rating agencies have rated us the best labour force in the\r\n\r\nworld, the best for the last 19 years.  Our economy is rated  as\r\n\r\nthe  second most competitive.  Our management talents  are  much\r\n\r\nsought   after.    Our  kids  outperform  kids  from   developed\r\n\r\ncountries.  We have good people and a good foundation from which\r\n\r\nto move on.  Only we must never tire of learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Subject Committee made several recommendations on life-long learning which we hope will bear fruit. I am happy to note\r\n\r\nthat MOM is working out a Manpower 21 plan which will bring life-long  learning to life.  I think we can trust MOM to look  after\r\n\r\nus.  But it takes more than just MOM and the Government to bring\r\n\r\nabout  life-long  learning.  After all, Singapore  21  is  about\r\n\r\neverybody  acting  on what he believes.  For example,  employers\r\n\r\nplay a part.  They must focus on building strong companies,  and\r\n\r\nnot  just on raising stock prices.  One practical way to do this\r\n\r\nis by continually upgrading the skills of their staff.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can play a part too. For re-training is often\r\n\r\ndifficult   for  older  workers,  family  members  can   provide\r\n\r\nencouragement  and emotional support for other members  who  are\r\n\r\nstruggling  to learn new skills.  But in the final analysis,  it\r\n\r\nis  the  individual himself who must want to  learn.  We  cannot\r\n\r\nforce  people to learn just as we cannot force parents  to  send\r\n\r\ntheir children to school.  The Government can provide funds  and\r\n\r\nfacilities.   But  ultimately, it is up to Singaporeans  whether\r\n\r\nthey  have  the  right  attitude towards  learning  and  towards\r\n\r\ncompeting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we truly believe that our future lies in making\r\n\r\nSingapore  a centre of opportunities for all, then we must  have\r\n\r\nthe  courage  and  the  resolve to act on  this  conviction  and\r\n\r\nwelcome foreign talents, with a Singapore 21 attitude - an  open\r\n\r\nmind  and a big heart.  For after all, we ourselves are a nation\r\n\r\nof  immigrants.   Take away the foreigners and new  citizens  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  today,  and you will immediately  stunt  our  growth.\r\n\r\nTake away\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1505</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of one generation ago, those of us  who  have  one\r\n\r\nparent  at  least  who was born overseas, and  I  would  not  be\r\n\r\nstanding  here speaking to you today.  Take away two generations\r\n\r\nand  a  third  of our civil service might well disappear.   Take\r\n\r\naway  three  generations and the first Cabinet would  have  only\r\n\r\ncomprised Senior Minister Lee and one other Minister.  We  would\r\n\r\nhave had no Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore in the 20th century has earned itself the\r\n\r\nreputation of being a miracle economy.  In the 21st century, our\r\n\r\nhope is that we, an immigrant people who have made Singapore our\r\n\r\nhome,  will  earn the reputation of being a distinctive  people,\r\n\r\none  who  are  united in our quest to make a  nation  out  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry.   And  it  is  towards that hope that  I  support  this\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, the publication of\r\n\r\nSingapore  21 - Together, We Make the Difference is very  timely\r\n\r\nas  we are only seven months from the new millennium.  The  book\r\n\r\nspells  out  the ways we need to follow to achieve this  vision.\r\n\r\nEvery  one of us has a key role to play and we can succeed  only\r\n\r\nif  all of us continue to work together.  I would like to direct\r\n\r\nmy  remarks to the Singapore Heartbeat and share with Members of\r\n\r\nthe  House a bit of my own experience.  In doing so, I  hope  to\r\n\r\npinpoint  the  essentials required to keep the  Singapore  Heart\r\n\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in China at the onset of the Second World War.\r\n\r\nMy  parents brought us to India where we stayed for four  years.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, we returned to Hong Kong, my father's birthplace.\r\n\r\nIn  those days, Hong Kong was rebuilding itself from the ravages\r\n\r\nof   war.    There   were  opportunities.    There   were   also\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  In 1955, my father was retrenched.  He decided to\r\n\r\ncome  to  Singapore to find a job and managed to get one  in  an\r\n\r\ninsurance  company. The family, comprising my  mother  and  four\r\n\r\nsons, came over a year later.  I was also a foreigner.  I am not\r\n\r\ntoo sure whether I have got the talent, but I was a foreigner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore in the mid-1950s was a turbulent place. Strikes\r\n\r\nand worker\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1506</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclashes occurred almost daily.  The racial harmony that  we  see\r\n\r\ntoday  was  not  in place.  The education system,  torn  between\r\n\r\nEnglish and Chinese, was in turmoil.  The economy was not  doing\r\n\r\nwell  and  living  standards were low.  I  still  remember  that\r\n\r\nduring  the  first  two  months of our  arrival,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTraction  Company (STC) was on strike.  My brother, Kenneth  and\r\n\r\nI, have to wait almost two hours to catch a bus operated by Hock\r\n\r\nLee  Bus  Company to school (St Anthony Boys' School)  and  back\r\n\r\nhome  in  MacPherson every day.  Somehow, we pulled through  the\r\n\r\n50s  and  early  60s,  despite  the  trauma  of  self-governing,\r\n\r\ncommunist confrontation, racial riots, the merger with  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand the subsequent separation in 1965.  Things began to pick  up\r\n\r\nin  the late 60s.  The past 30 years saw the making of Singapore\r\n\r\ninto  a  prosperous city state, with a multi-racial  and  multi-religious backdrop, in which all of us live in harmony, each one\r\n\r\ncontributing in his or her own special way to nation-building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to wonder what was on my father's mind during these\r\n\r\nturbulent  times as he grappled with making a living to  support\r\n\r\nthe  family.   In his own time, he had travelled  worldwide  and\r\n\r\nstayed  in  many  places.  Why did he finally choose  Singapore,\r\n\r\ndespite the uncertain and difficult conditions then?  Why did he\r\n\r\nnot move on to greener pastures as many have done?  It could not\r\n\r\nbe  that  he  became  rich, because he did  not  own  his  first\r\n\r\napartment  until  he  was  well  into  his  60s.   He  had  many\r\n\r\nalternatives, yet he opted for Singapore.  In a few years before\r\n\r\nhis  death  in 1976, in reflecting on his life, he told  us  his\r\n\r\nreasons  for  doing so.  First and foremost, he  found  that  he\r\n\r\nbelonged.   At long last, he could say that he had a home  which\r\n\r\nhe  could  call  his own.  A home is where you  have  a  family,\r\n\r\nliving happily together.  You have relatives and friends who you\r\n\r\ncan  turn to in times of happiness which you share and  when  in\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  you can help each other out.  Although  life  was\r\n\r\ndifficult and there were plenty of challenges, the support given\r\n\r\nby the family and friends was crucial for him to shape the sense\r\n\r\nof belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father never longed for what he did not have. Rather,\r\n\r\nhe  took great satisfaction in what he had and he treasured them\r\n\r\nand  shared  generously  with his family.   Above  all,  he  was\r\n\r\ngrateful   that  his  family  benefited  from  an   increasingly\r\n\r\nprosperous  Singapore, which offered both  security  and  better\r\n\r\nwell-being.  All his children and grandchildren in Singapore are\r\n\r\nin  one  way  or  another beneficiaries.   For  myself,  I  have\r\n\r\nbenefited greatly from Singapore as I have all my secondary  and\r\n\r\ntertiary   education   paid  for  by  way   of   bursaries   and\r\n\r\nscholarships.  Like the Prime Minister too, I was offered a  PhD\r\n\r\nFellowship  from the university in Canada where I  studied,  but\r\n\r\nthe PSC also called me back to serve.  I must say that I am glad\r\n\r\nthat I came back.  My father died a happy and contented man.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's landscape has changed beyond recognition in the\r\n\r\n23 years since his death.  Our economy has prospered and with it\r\n\r\nmuch  higher  standard  of living.  However,  some  fundamentals\r\n\r\nremain  unchanged  over  these years.   We  are  still  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry, despite the reclamation of more land. We remain a multi-racial and multi-religious society.  As the population grows, we\r\n\r\nfind  that  we  are  getting more crowded and getting  into  one\r\n\r\nanother's  way  more  often.  As we look beyond  our  shores  to\r\n\r\nexpand our economy and seek regional and global markets, we have\r\n\r\nbecome more exposed to foreign influences, not only in terms  of\r\n\r\neconomics  but,  more  importantly, the different  cultures  and\r\n\r\nvalues  that  such  exposures brought along.  In  fact,  nation-building,  as  the  Prime Minister has said, which  was  already\r\n\r\ndifficult  in  the  60s  and 70s, has become  more  complex  and\r\n\r\nchallenging  as we move into the next millennium.   We  have  to\r\n\r\nreckon  with the domestic forces at work, resolve the  conflicts\r\n\r\nand  overcome  the  constraints, at the same time,  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount  the  external influences that affect our decisions  and\r\n\r\nchoices.   One  thing is certain, our job of nation-building  is\r\n\r\ngetting tougher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I reflect on my father's words and his deeds and reading\r\n\r\nSingapore 21, I could\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1508</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsee some parallels.  First, the family is the foundation and  an\r\n\r\nessential  unit in nation-building.  It is a reflection  of  the\r\n\r\nsociety at large.  Without cohesive and harmonious families,  no\r\n\r\nnation will last long.  On the other hand, strong families  will\r\n\r\ngo towards strengthening the nation especially in times of need.\r\n\r\nThe  successful  formula to a happy family is love  and  respect\r\n\r\namong  the  members.  There has to be a large dose of  give  and\r\n\r\ntake,  and  every willingness to work together  for  the  common\r\n\r\ngood.  It is no different for society or country, except that it\r\n\r\nis  even more necessary to recognise the characters of a  multi-racial and multi-religious society.  We have to be more tolerant\r\n\r\nto  each  other's  ethnic background, and respect  each  other's\r\n\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was often asked by overseas visitors how all the races in\r\n\r\nSingapore  could stay so happily together.  I have to tell  them\r\n\r\nthat  we  have to work hard at it.  Racial and religious harmony\r\n\r\ndoes  not  come automatically.  In fact, sometimes they  do  not\r\n\r\neven  come naturally.  We have to go out of our way to  make  it\r\n\r\nwork  and make sure that it continues to do so for a long,  long\r\n\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there must be equal opportunities for everyone in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  regardless of race, language or religion.   Only  in\r\n\r\nthis  way can we inculcate the commitment and sense of belonging\r\n\r\nto  the  country  we all call our home.  Every Singaporean  will\r\n\r\nthen be allowed to strive to reach his or her maximum potential.\r\n\r\nNot  all of us could achieve the same success in life, as we are\r\n\r\nall  made differently.  But all of us should in time achieve the\r\n\r\nsame  level  of  commitment  to our  society,  to  our  country,\r\n\r\nwhatever position we may be holding in life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 states emphatically that every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmatters.  I would add that every Singaporean matters, no  matter\r\n\r\nwhat success he can achieve as long as he has given of his best.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must play our part as citizens of Singapore\r\n\r\nactively.   It  is  not enough to confine our attention  to  our\r\n\r\nimmediate family.  Our friends and neighbours\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1509</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeserve our attention, especially in times of trouble.   We  may\r\n\r\nneed  them  when  our  turn comes.  It  is  only  by  overcoming\r\n\r\ntroubles  together that we can appreciate what we  mean  to  one\r\n\r\nanother.   In  doing  so,  the bonds  between  all  of  us  will\r\n\r\nstrengthen with time and we will be ready to face new challenges\r\n\r\ntogether.  In a city state where we live in close proximity with\r\n\r\none  another, the need to look after our neighbours becomes even\r\n\r\ngreater.  The Residents' Committees, the Town Councils  and  the\r\n\r\nCommunity Development Councils are all vehicles to enable us  to\r\n\r\nreach  out  to  our  fellow  citizens,  building  up  a  lasting\r\n\r\nfriendship and be ready to come to one another's aid in time  of\r\n\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was too busy making a living for the family to\r\n\r\ncontribute  some of his time to society.  I guess he would  have\r\n\r\nbeen  pleased  to  know that two of his sons became  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament after his death, and make up in a small way  what  he\r\n\r\ndid not do.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commitment and belonging cannot be lectured into our hearts\r\n\r\nand  minds.  Rather we must develop them from within.  Singapore\r\n\r\n21,  therefore,  must  not  be just a  campaign  like  the  many\r\n\r\ncampaigns  that  we  have come across.  It is  a  soul-searching\r\n\r\nprocess involving the examination of the fundamentals we hold as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   We  must  open  ourselves  to  the  emotive  and\r\n\r\nspiritual dimensions in arriving at our own decisions.  We  must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to transcend the materialistic objectives and look  at\r\n\r\nwhere  our hearts take us.  We should not bemoan what we do  not\r\n\r\nhave,  but  treasure what we have already got.  The  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  ultimately  depends not only on material well  being  but,\r\n\r\nmore important, emotional and spiritual fulfilment.  Ultimately,\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is not just a passport to vote and avail  ourselves\r\n\r\nto  the benefits.  More important, it signifies where we belong.\r\n\r\nOnce  we  establish this belonging, the commitment to  work  and\r\n\r\nfight for one's country will come naturally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of this sense of belonging and commitment\r\n\r\ncan take a lifetime, as one goes through the experience of trial\r\n\r\nand error.  For younger citizens who have yet to go through this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexperience, my advice is to open your hearts and minds, and  ask\r\n\r\nthe fundamental questions which have been posed in Singapore 21.\r\n\r\nConsult  those  who  have  gone through  life,  especially  your\r\n\r\nparents  and your older friends and relatives.  You may be  able\r\n\r\nto  shorten  your learning curve.  Remember that the  grass  may\r\n\r\nlook  greener  on the other side of the fence,  but  usually  it\r\n\r\nturns out not to be so.  Many of our younger Singaporeans lament\r\n\r\nthat they do not have the time and space to do their own things,\r\n\r\nand  think that they can do better in other countries, including\r\n\r\nowning  big houses and driving big cars that do not cost an  arm\r\n\r\nand a leg.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These things may be important for a while but, ultimately,\r\n\r\none must go back to the fundamentals of home and country.  As my\r\n\r\nfather  did  40 years ago, he chose Singapore for  him  and  his\r\n\r\nfamily.   He  had  no regrets.  Those of us in  the  family  who\r\n\r\nfollowed  him have no regrets either.  Ultimately, the Singapore\r\n\r\nheartbeat  is  for all Singaporeans to maintain and  strengthen.\r\n\r\nTo  my fellow Singaporeans, young and old, only you can make the\r\n\r\nfinal choice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, after listening\r\n\r\nto  Mr Bernard Chen's moving speech, I think there can hardly be\r\n\r\nany  doubt that the Singapore heartbeat is one which is tangible\r\n\r\nand not merely a nice catch phrase nor a platitude.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one attends National Day Parades and we see the tens\r\n\r\nof  thousands of Singaporeans in their jubilant elation and  the\r\n\r\ncelebration of our national birthday, the sense of pride in  the\r\n\r\ncountry  and  its  achievements, when we hear everybody  in  the\r\n\r\nstadium reciting the National Pledge and saying \"We the Citizens\r\n\r\nof  Singapore\",  or when we see everyone standing  to  attention\r\n\r\nwhen  the  National Anthem is played, we all know that something\r\n\r\nstirs  in our emotions, and that sense of emotion and that sense\r\n\r\nof  attachment are not merely a passing phase, an emotion of the\r\n\r\ntime,  but  that it is something real, something  tangible.   In\r\n\r\nother  words,  the  Singapore  heartbeat  is  not,  as  Mr  J  B\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam said, a platitude, but I believe that it  is  a  real\r\n\r\nemotion, a patriotism, a loyalty, to this country which we  call\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am in an airplane flying back to Singapore,\r\n\r\nespecially  after a long trip abroad, and when I see  the  first\r\n\r\nbuildings, when I see the greenery of Singapore, when I see  the\r\n\r\nport,  the ships, I cannot help but feel a sense of familiarity,\r\n\r\na  sense  of  comfort,  a  sense that I  am  coming  home.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore  heartbeat is all of these emotions, but  it  is  also\r\n\r\nmore.   It  is  based on an understanding that Singaporeans  are\r\n\r\ndistinctive as a people, that the Singapore culture  is  unique,\r\n\r\nevolving, and that we have  a distinctive national identity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel this most when I travel abroad, because it is very\r\n\r\nobvious  that I do not speak with an English neither an American\r\n\r\naccent.  And particularly when I lapse into the lah  of Singlish\r\n\r\nin   private   conversation,  my  nationality  is   given   away\r\n\r\nimmediately.  One can spot a Singaporean a mile off whenever  he\r\n\r\nor   she  opens  his  or  her  mouth,  because  of  our  accent.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  I do not speak Mandarin the way the PRC  Chinese  or\r\n\r\nthe  Taiwanese do.   I speak Mandarin not very well perhaps, but\r\n\r\nI do speak some Mandarin in a way in which Singaporeans do, with\r\n\r\na very unique Singapore accent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just the accent. It is not just the chicken rice\r\n\r\nnor  the  laksa.  But the very ideals and ethos of  a  Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  believes in meritocracy, in multi-racialism,  in  a  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment  and efficiency are as much part and  parcel  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  identity, and I believe very much part and parcel  of\r\n\r\nwhat  we  are, those of us who have grown up in Singapore.   All\r\n\r\nthis is part of the Singapore heartbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if all this is already happening, then the question is:\r\n\r\nwhy the emphasis on the Singapore heartbeat and the Singapore 21\r\n\r\nvision  for  the 21st century?  If it exists already,  then  why\r\n\r\nthis continued focus?  For two reasons: first, we cannot take it\r\n\r\nfor  granted that the heartbeat will grow stronger and, in fact,\r\n\r\nglobalisation could cause the heartbeat to grow weaker  and  not\r\n\r\nstronger.   Second,  there  needs  to  be  a  nurturing  of  the\r\n\r\nheartbeat,  for it is not as strong and steady now as  we  would\r\n\r\nlike it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1512</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  be.   Listening  to the Prime Minister  this  afternoon,  we\r\n\r\nrealise  that there are still cleavages in our society  that  we\r\n\r\nneed  to work at, and that we need to build on, for, as  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid, we may be a country, but we are not yet a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1989 to 1990, I spent one and a half very happy years in\r\n\r\nVancouver.  It was there that I learnt how to golf and ski.  The\r\n\r\nski  slopes were just 45 minutes away from my house.  And during\r\n\r\nthe winter and spring seasons, the first thing I would do when I\r\n\r\nwoke  up  would be to look out of the window at the ski  slopes,\r\n\r\ncheck out the weather and if fine, load the skis on my car, take\r\n\r\na  quick  breakfast,  and I would be at the  ski  slopes  in  45\r\n\r\nminutes.   Needless  to  say, it is not  that  easy  to  ski  in\r\n\r\nSingapore!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer in Vancouver, I went fishing, I went hiking.\r\n\r\nThe mountains around Vancouver are glorious, and so are the golf\r\n\r\ncourses.   My  husband and I seriously contemplated  staying  in\r\n\r\nVancouver, and we actually went around looking for property, but\r\n\r\neventually  we came back.  It was not an easy decision  to  come\r\n\r\nback,  because life was good in Vancouver.   There was  not  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  stress  that there is in Singapore.   So  why  did  we\r\n\r\nreturn?   Because it was only in Singapore that we felt that  we\r\n\r\ncould really contribute to society as equals, and not as second-class citizens.  We felt that we were Asians and we wanted to be\r\n\r\nin Asia where the opportunities are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I have relatives in Shanghai, cousins of about\r\n\r\nmy  age.  And I often wonder whether it is merely an accident of\r\n\r\nhistory  that  I  was born in Singapore with  the  opportunities\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have,  which they do not have, for each  of  my  three\r\n\r\ncousins spent many years in the villages, in the farms, having a\r\n\r\nvery  hard life working on the farms.  Two of them did not  have\r\n\r\nthe  privilege of going to the university simply because of  the\r\n\r\ntime in which they were born, about the same time as I was born.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference? The difference is that I was born\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, and being in Singapore, I had the opportunity  to\r\n\r\ngo to school, to go to the university and hence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non,  to  do what I am doing now.  And that is the reason why  we\r\n\r\ncame  back.  It is because, in Singapore, this is our  home,  we\r\n\r\ncan  contribute in this country in a way which is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  do  elsewhere.   It is here, I think,  as  Mr  Bernard  Chen\r\n\r\nmentioned, that we have had the opportunity, and for those of us\r\n\r\nhere  in this House, to be educated and to do what we have  done\r\n\r\nand to be where we are now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although we feel this way, we cannot be sure that\r\n\r\nsucceeding  generations of Singaporeans will  feel  exactly  the\r\n\r\nsame.  There is definitely a generational difference.  For those\r\n\r\nwho  are  highly  skilled, highly mobile,  the  world  is  their\r\n\r\noyster.  Why should they return to Singapore?   And that is  the\r\n\r\nquestion  that  I  think  many  young  Singaporeans  are  asking\r\n\r\nthemselves  today, particularly those who have  gone  abroad  to\r\n\r\nstudy.  Why should they return to Singapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the S21 vision, we recognise that there will indeed be\r\n\r\nmany  more Singaporeans who will go abroad either to work or  to\r\n\r\nstudy.   And  this  is  not  only inevitable,  in  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\ndesirable   because   of   the   fact   that   Singapore    must\r\n\r\ninternationalise in order to continue to prosper,  if  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  must go abroad in order to be able to expand  and  to\r\n\r\ncompete.   Therefore,  the Singapore community  in  future  will\r\n\r\ncomprise   not   just  the  Singaporeans  here  but   also   the\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who  are  abroad.  And  we  want  the  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncommunity  to be inclusive and not exclusive, to recognise  that\r\n\r\nthere  will  be  many more Singaporeans who will be  living  and\r\n\r\nworking abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the difference? The difference is that in our\r\n\r\nvision,  Singaporeans, no matter where they are  in  the  world,\r\n\r\nshould  have  an  emotional rootedness to Singapore,  that  they\r\n\r\nconsider  Singapore as home, and that there  is  a  loyalty  and\r\n\r\nattachment to Singapore that will remain with them no matter how\r\n\r\nlong  they  have  lived or worked abroad, and  because  of  this\r\n\r\nattachment,  that they will want to contribute to  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nsome  tangible  way.   They  could be working  for  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompany  overseas.  They could be working for a company that  is\r\n\r\ndoing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  Singapore.  Or they could  simply  be  helping  to\r\n\r\npromote  goodwill for Singapore.  Whatever it  is,  it  is  this\r\n\r\nissue  of  the  emotional rootedness to Singapore  that  we  are\r\n\r\nconcerned about and we want to realise in the S21 Vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we nurture the Singapore heartbeat, so that it grows\r\n\r\nstrong and steady?  The Singapore 21 report contains a number of\r\n\r\nrecommendations  such  as consciously preserving  landmarks  and\r\n\r\nbuildings  that  serve  as emotional anchors.   It  talks  about\r\n\r\ndeveloping national icons.  It talks about fostering a  stronger\r\n\r\nsense  of  national  identity.  The PM  mentioned  the  need  to\r\n\r\ncontinue to build bridges among the races.  What I would like to\r\n\r\nadd  here  is  that there is one more bridge  that  we  need  to\r\n\r\nconsciously  build, and that is the bridge between  the  public,\r\n\r\nprivate  and  people  sectors.   The  title  of  the  report  is\r\n\r\n\"Together, We Make The Difference\".  S21 is about the  \"we\",  it\r\n\r\nis  about  community, it is about bonding  as  a  society.   But\r\n\r\nunless we are careful, this one cleavage between the public  and\r\n\r\nthe  people sectors in particular can hinder the achievement  of\r\n\r\nthe S21 Vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saddens me when I come across civil servants who\r\n\r\nconsider  NGOs  and  other groups in the  people  sector  as  an\r\n\r\nunruly, disorganised mass.  Likewise, it also saddens me when  I\r\n\r\ncome  across  people  in  civil society who  are  cynical  about\r\n\r\nGovernment initiatives and projects, who are cynical  about  the\r\n\r\nS21 report as yet another Government report and that it does not\r\n\r\nsignal  any real change.  In other words, there still  exists  a\r\n\r\nmistrust  between  the public sector on the  one  hand  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector on the other.  This gap needs to be bridged,  and\r\n\r\nwe do need a mindset change.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore heartbeat is not about many hearts beating in\r\n\r\ndissonance, each to its own rhythm.  It is not about the  public\r\n\r\nsector  doing  its own thing; the private sector doing  its  own\r\n\r\nthing;  the  people sector doing its own thing.   Rather  it  is\r\n\r\nabout  many hearts beating in resonance with one another.   Each\r\n\r\nsector has its own strengths and its own weaknesses.  We need to\r\n\r\nsupport one another,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbuild one another up, and not criticise and tear down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot Government replies, regardless of whether they are\r\n\r\nin the Forum page or otherwise, be polite and civil?  Cannot the\r\n\r\nGovernment  acknowledge good ideas which came  from  the  people\r\n\r\nsector  and  not from themselves?  And cannot the people  sector\r\n\r\nforget the Catherine Lim affair, treat it as an incident of  the\r\n\r\npast, and let us together begin a new page of partnership?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge the public sector as a start to give its\r\n\r\nresponse  to the recommendations in the S21 report and  to  make\r\n\r\nthese  responses  public.   In fact, to  go  one  step  further,\r\n\r\npublish   responses  to  the  recommendations  in  the   subject\r\n\r\ncommittee deliberations, so that all the efforts of the  subject\r\n\r\ncommittees  themselves do not just disappear into a black  hole.\r\n\r\nFor  the people sector, I would say, be involved, be engaged  in\r\n\r\nat  least  one  activity, people sector activity, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is charity or it is a group such as preserving  the\r\n\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the Singapore heartbeat is about caring - that we care for our families, that we care for our community\r\n\r\nand  that we care for our country - this island that we call our\r\n\r\nhome.   This  caring, which is so much a part of  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nheartbeat, is the very essence of the vision that we  hope  will\r\n\r\nbe realised in 21st century Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise  in support of the motion in the name of  Minister\r\n\r\nRAdm Teo Chee Hean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, looking at the glossy cover of the book \"Singapore 21,\r\n\r\nTogether We Make The Difference\", it reminded me of two things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the confident and somewhat smiling faces of the\r\n\r\nkids,  our future, looking out of the jigsaw window of a complex\r\n\r\nand global environment, reminds\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nme  of what Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew asked some time back\r\n\r\n- whether there will still be Singapore 100 years hence.  I also\r\n\r\nwondered  what  Senior Minister will have to  say  about  vision\r\n\r\nSingapore  21.   We  know  that on  two  occasions  when  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister was asked about his experience with multi-racialism and\r\n\r\nnation   building,  he  choked,  almost  to  tears.   SM   Lee's\r\n\r\nexperience then must have been very heartwrenching.  PM Goh  has\r\n\r\njust  shared his piece of mind with us and I totally share those\r\n\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my humble mind, what is embodied in \"Singapore 21,\r\n\r\nTogether  We  Make The Difference\" speaks volumes  of  the  same\r\n\r\nconcerns  PM  Goh  and  SM  Lee  have  for  Singapore's  future.\r\n\r\nPersonally,  I  am confident that we will be able  to  make  the\r\n\r\ndifference, and make a success of what Singapore stands for, not\r\n\r\nonly   for  those  children's  generation  but  that  of   their\r\n\r\nchildren's too, stretching more than 100 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I sound over confident or even rhetorical, allow\r\n\r\nme  to  remind  ourselves  that all is not  perfect,  as  things\r\n\r\nnormally  are.  There may be many trials, and even tribulations,\r\n\r\nif we do not know how to manage the challenges that await us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure Members will remember\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not short of vision.  Neither were  we  short  of\r\n\r\nchallenges.   Remember the Battle for Merger, the fight  against\r\n\r\ncommunism  and  communalism?   Remember  our  \"Survival\"   days?\r\n\r\nRemember  The  Next Lap and Vision 1999?  All in  all,  we  have\r\n\r\nshown that our vision statements were not mere dreams.  We  have\r\n\r\nalso  one  by  one  overcome  those challenges.   We  have  been\r\n\r\npragmatists,  pragmatic idealists, if you  like.   But  we  also\r\n\r\nrealise  that the challenge of nation building is  more  than  a\r\n\r\nmarathon.  In the words of PM Goh, unending.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh has also sounded a note of caution, a dose of\r\n\r\nrealism, in this debate.  I think it is most timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we not see the subtle hint of those possible 'blues' in\r\n\r\nthe cover of the book?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1517</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter all, as Minister Teo Chee Hean said in his opening remarks\r\n\r\nyesterday,  I  quote, \"for those who think that  conflict  is  a\r\n\r\nthing of the past, one need only to think of Kosovo .\".  And  if\r\n\r\nI  may add, the gory picture of an Indonesian Dayak (or was it a\r\n\r\nMalay?) carrying the dismembered head of a Madurese will  remain\r\n\r\nvivid in our memory to remind us that the ugly head of ethnicity\r\n\r\nis  still lurking around, even in these days of cyber technology\r\n\r\nand KBE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I too went\r\n\r\nthrough the riots of 1964 coming face to face with bloody racial\r\n\r\nviolence.   I  was in Secondary 3 then and I will  never  forget\r\n\r\nthose  senseless scenes.  It was at Victoria Street  near  where\r\n\r\nthe  Lavender  MRT  station now is that I saw Malays  or  Malay-looking  youths  being  maimed and  perhaps  even  killed,  with\r\n\r\nbicycle  chains, iron rods and acid bulbs.  And at  the  end  of\r\n\r\nthat longest journey home for me to Geylang and Joo Chiat, I saw\r\n\r\nMalays  hitting innocent Chinese, particularly a trishaw  rider,\r\n\r\nwith blood streaming down his swollen face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that day onwards, for my sake and that of my children,\r\n\r\nand  generations to come, I swore to do my utmost to  make  sure\r\n\r\nracial riots and violence do not return to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nation building is never easy, especially for a state whose\r\n\r\npopulation  is  as  diverse as that of  Singapore.   However,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that it is those kinds of challenges that will bond  us\r\n\r\ntogether  further, if we are united in our sense of purpose  and\r\n\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the title \"Make the Difference\"\r\n\r\nalso  reminds me of another sense of mission, that of the  Malay\r\n\r\nself-help  group,  MENDAKI, in fact the Malay  community  called\r\n\r\n\"Making the Difference\" (showed cover of the MENDAKI book).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, the Malays are not making a claim of copyright.\r\n\r\nMinister Teo Chee Hean should be reassured that they are instead\r\n\r\nmost  happy  to share that symphony of purpose.   For  sure,  we\r\n\r\nshare  a  common  destiny.  After all, the  slogan  \"Making  the\r\n\r\nDifference\" also emanates from Prime\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1518</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister Goh's National Day Rally speech earlier this decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the Malay community or Singapore 21, the rallying\r\n\r\npoint  is  similar.  The message is clear: Let us  get  our  act\r\n\r\ntogether to make a success of our `Singapore Uno'.  Together, as\r\n\r\na more cohesive, multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore, we have to tackle the challenges of the next  century\r\n\r\nand the next millennium head on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, today, at the 2000 year old Great\r\n\r\nWall  of  China, is a Millennium Countdown Clock which calls  on\r\n\r\nits people to \"seize the moment . build the motherland\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel the same sentiment about preserving and enhancing\r\n\r\nour island state Singapore when reading the Singapore 21 book.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Singapore 21 Committee chose not to call it a\r\n\r\nblueprint,  the possible `blues' notwithstanding, I  agree  that\r\n\r\nthe ideas around the five pillars of Singapore 21 will serve  as\r\n\r\nan important compass to navigate our future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"broad strokes\" of \"every Singaporean matters, strong\r\n\r\nfamilies,  opportunities for all, the Singaporean heartbeat  and\r\n\r\nactive citizens\" all add up to the sense of unity in diversity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also reminds me of the broad strokes of calligraphy\r\n\r\ngiven to me by the renowned Pan Shou called: He Xie or Harmony.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that is not to say that\r\n\r\nthere  are  no  shades  of differences or  problems  here.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  the debate over SAP schools, after over  10  years  in\r\n\r\nexistence, still lingers.  So with the question of Malays in the\r\n\r\narmy.   Or, recently, the unhappiness felt particularly  by  the\r\n\r\nminorities about racial discrimination in employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no problem with the official clarification given\r\n\r\nover  such  issues.  I understand the need for SAP  schools  but\r\n\r\nfeel  reassured that more will be done to ensure  that  the  SAP\r\n\r\nstudents   are   not   isolated  in  their   understanding   and\r\n\r\nappreciation of the importance of multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1519</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the Malays in the SAF, I welcome the\r\n\r\nstatement  made by DPM Dr Tony Tan reassuring us  that  the  SAF\r\n\r\nwill not allow anyone to be discriminated because of race.   The\r\n\r\nNTUC  resolution  on  May  Day last week  against  any  form  of\r\n\r\ndiscrimination in employment is also timely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will still be the need to continue to\r\n\r\nmonitor  such  issues  so  as not to allow  them  to  divide  us\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Even  policies that impinge on  multi-racialism,\r\n\r\nincluding  those  on racial integration in HDB  estates,  school\r\n\r\nenrolment,    multi-racial    representation    in    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations,  need regular revisits either for fine-tuning  or\r\n\r\nrevision so as to facilitate better cohesion in our multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, multi-racialism is too important a pillar for\r\n\r\nus  to  take  for granted.  It is critical that we  ensure  that\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism prevails and be strengthened from time to  time.\r\n\r\nIt  is  an unending process.  It is a heartwarming part  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore heartbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the motion on\r\n\r\nthe Singapore 21 Vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion and feel fortunate that I have\r\n\r\nbeen  involved in the S21 process for the last 18  months.   Our\r\n\r\nlast  30  years  of nation building has been largely  successful\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  style of governance we have had  during  those\r\n\r\nyears,  where  the Government played a dominant  role  and  many\r\n\r\ndecisions  being top down driven.  The style of  governance  was\r\n\r\nnecessary  because  of the political and social  environment  of\r\n\r\nthose times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, the governance of Singapore is going to be\r\n\r\nmuch  more  complex than before because of a number of  reasons.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  we  are heading towards a knowledge based economy  but\r\n\r\nthe complexity is not because of the content of such an economy,\r\n\r\nbut rather how we must be organised to participate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  it.   Second, the world is becoming increasingly  borderless\r\n\r\nand  many of our people will be able to choose to live and  work\r\n\r\nin  most  of the appealing parts of the world.  Similarly,  many\r\n\r\nforeigners  will  be  living  and  working  in  Singapore,  thus\r\n\r\ninfluencing  the behaviour of Singaporeans.  Third,  our  people\r\n\r\nare  more educated today, well travelled and more exposed to the\r\n\r\ncultures, values and systems of other worlds.  They will be able\r\n\r\nto  and will want to play an increasingly important role in  how\r\n\r\nthe country is run.  Fourth, as we progress, the needs of people\r\n\r\nbecome  more  sophisticated and as we clearly know, basic  needs\r\n\r\nlike  food, shelter and job having been fulfilled will give  way\r\n\r\nto  higher  level needs like self-esteem, individual rights  and\r\n\r\nspirituality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, managing the affairs of the country in the future will\r\n\r\ntherefore  become  a  more difficult job because  the  focus  of\r\n\r\ngovernance will become much wider compared to the last 30 years.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because new issues have to be addressed if  we  really\r\n\r\nwant to make Singapore the best home for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our past system of relying on a few good men alone will not\r\n\r\nwork  well.   We will need many more minds to come  together  to\r\n\r\noffer  solutions.   Our  formula  of  over  dependence  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  was  acceptable  in  the  past  because   both   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   and   the   people  were  comfortable   with   this\r\n\r\narrangement.  Today, both the people and the Government need  to\r\n\r\naccept that their roles will have to change and both must find a\r\n\r\nhappy  balance  of  the formula that will work  in  the  future.\r\n\r\nMajor  mindset changes need to take place first.  The Government\r\n\r\nneeds to let go while Singaporeans need to take more interest to\r\n\r\ndo  more.   This must be a joint responsibility of  the  public,\r\n\r\nprivate and the people sectors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my subject committee studied the issue of \"Singapore\r\n\r\nas  a  Home\"  thoroughly  and  the reason  is,  as  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ninternationalise, there will be increasing pressures on them  to\r\n\r\nmake  choices as to where they would live, work and raise  their\r\n\r\nfamilies.   We  felt  that  if we wanted  Singaporeans  to  call\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  home, a number of conditions in our country must  prevail\r\n\r\nfirst.   The  most  important of these is that each  Singaporean\r\n\r\nmust  feel that he or she has a stake in the country  and  as  a\r\n\r\nstakeholder, there must be a sense of ownership of what goes  on\r\n\r\nhere.   For  this sense of ownership to prevail,  everyone  must\r\n\r\nparticipate in the running of the country.  If every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmakes  it  his  or her responsibility to contribute constructive\r\n\r\nideas  and  solutions and be willing to be accountable  for  the\r\n\r\noutcome,  then  I  believe  we will be  successful  in  bringing\r\n\r\nSingapore to a higher level of progress in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore feel that this sense of ownership and\r\n\r\nbeing a stakeholder is the most important prerequisite if we are\r\n\r\nserious  about  realising  the  Singapore  21  Vision.   We,  as\r\n\r\ncitizens,  must  have  a buy-in to the vision.   This  does  not\r\n\r\nbelong  just to the Government, not to the public sector  alone,\r\n\r\nbut to all of us.  If we cannot achieve this sense of ownership,\r\n\r\nthen  I  am  afraid we will fail in developing  this  notion  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  our  Best  Home and we will  not  get  closer  to\r\n\r\nrealising our vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our subject committee, very early in the process,\r\n\r\nidentified the concept of emotional rootedness, as Dr  Lee  Tsao\r\n\r\nYuan  mentioned earlier on, as being the most important approach\r\n\r\nof   developing  the  type  of  attachment  that  we  want   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   Physical rootedness of being physically  present\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  alone  is  not enough.   No  matter  where  one's\r\n\r\nphysical  location  is,  one's  sense  of  belonging,  emotional\r\n\r\nattachment  and  loyalty  should  be  to  Singapore.   Emotional\r\n\r\nrootedness  refers to the degree of psychological commitment  to\r\n\r\nthe  country.  A high degree of emotional rootedness suggests  a\r\n\r\npassionate  and  intense  sense  of  belonging,  commitment  and\r\n\r\nloyalty to the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore globalises, a larger proportion of our\r\n\r\ntalented people who are highly mobile will grow.  The danger  is\r\n\r\nthat  their  physical absence from Singapore  might  reduce  the\r\n\r\nemotional commitment to the country and may result in  a  higher\r\n\r\nrate of emigration.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsolution  therefore is to encourage a high degree  of  emotional\r\n\r\nrootedness so that Singapore will always have a special place in\r\n\r\none's heart, as a home.  It is only then that we can achieve the\r\n\r\nSingapore heartbeat that we have talked about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in developing the goal of the Singapore Heartbeat with\r\n\r\nthe  vision of Singapore as a Home, our committee focused on how\r\n\r\nwe  could  strengthen the emotional rootednesss of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand we realised that there are many factors involved in creating\r\n\r\nthe sense of belonging.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best home must provide the best hope for its people.\r\n\r\nThere  must be confidence and not fear of the future.  Singapore\r\n\r\nshould  offer a good quality of life, not just for those who  we\r\n\r\ntraditionally  classify as being successful,  but  also  to  all\r\n\r\ncitizens.  No matter what one's race, religion or background is,\r\n\r\nthere must be harmony, unity of purpose and a transcending sense\r\n\r\nof  national  identity.  These common attitudes  and  attributes\r\n\r\nwill uniquely identify the Singaporean community of the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People of all races must make special efforts to learn of\r\n\r\nthe beliefs and peculiarities of each other's practices and ways\r\n\r\nof  life.   They  must make it a personal responsibility  to  be\r\n\r\naware  of the sensitivities and to promote a spirit of tolerance\r\n\r\nand understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, I would like to touch on a few of the\r\n\r\nrecommendations  that our subject committee made.   Firstly,  on\r\n\r\nencouraging the community spirit to blossom through more bottom-up initiatives.  Sir, we have many grassroots organisations, the\r\n\r\nmain  ones  being Government or PA-driven.  They have been  very\r\n\r\nsuccessful in serving the needs of citizens, particularly  those\r\n\r\nliving  in  the  HDB  estates, through  organisations  like  the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees.  The Community Development Councils  are\r\n\r\nalso  starting  to  be  very effective  in  promoting  community\r\n\r\nbonding.   There  are  also  many  other  non-Government  linked\r\n\r\nvolunteer organisations like the Lions Club, the Buddhist  Lodge\r\n\r\nand many others who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1523</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  played  a  very  important  role  in  promoting  community\r\n\r\nbonding.   Our  committee, however, felt that the  participation\r\n\r\nrate  of  Singaporeans in such organisations and  in  performing\r\n\r\ncommunity  service is far too low.  In fact, a survey  that  was\r\n\r\nconducted by the S21 Committee also showed this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More encouragement and latitude should be given to people\r\n\r\nwanting  to organise themselves in community service activities.\r\n\r\nWe hope to see more community activities and civic organisations\r\n\r\nthrough bottom-up initiatives with people with a common interest\r\n\r\ngetting  together spontaneously, rather than being asked  to  do\r\n\r\nso.   These will complement the many existing organisations that\r\n\r\nwe  already have.  These organisations should not be Government-driven  and  the people sector must take the responsibility  for\r\n\r\nforming such organisations to improve the lives of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, everyone is important and we must broaden the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  meritocracy and success.  Sir, the  practice  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy has served us well in the past.  It has enabled  the\r\n\r\nbest  and the brightest to rise through the system, irregardless\r\n\r\nof  race, family backdrop or gender.  However, the system may no\r\n\r\nlonger  work  as we move towards a different type of environment\r\n\r\nwhere being academically smart alone is not enough.  Sir, for us\r\n\r\nto succeed in the future, we feel that the current definition of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  is  too  narrow,  focusing  only  on  academic  and\r\n\r\neconomic  excellence.   This  definition  and  the  practice  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy and the way we define success along the  same  lines\r\n\r\ndoes  not allow every Singaporean to develop to his or her  full\r\n\r\npotential.  If we look back in history, the best leaders in  the\r\n\r\nworld are not all scholars.  On the contrary, many did not  have\r\n\r\nstraight `As' or impressive paper qualification.  A true  leader\r\n\r\npossesses  many qualities consisting of both IQ and  EQ  factors\r\n\r\nand  I  feel  that it is about time we modified our practice  of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy to include the new EQ measures, which I  can  agree,\r\n\r\nare  difficult  to measure.  But this needs  to  be  done.   Our\r\n\r\ncurrent scholar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1524</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsystem which was set in place many years ago needs to change  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  will be able to select leaders of diverse  backgrounds\r\n\r\nand not those of the same mould to lead the country.  We have to\r\n\r\nmove  away  from  stereotype role models and include  both  non-scholars as well as those who have talents other than being able\r\n\r\nto   score  well  in  examinations  as  examples  of  successful\r\n\r\nSingaporeans whom we value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every Singaporean has a role to play and as long as\r\n\r\neveryone  tries to achieve his or her full potential, we  should\r\n\r\nbe proud of them.  Not everyone will make it to the top, neither\r\n\r\ncan such a society exist because we need people at all levels of\r\n\r\nsociety  for a country to function.  We therefore should respect\r\n\r\nand give equal opportunities to everyone no matter what they  do\r\n\r\nfor  a  living.  It is about time that we practised  meritocracy\r\n\r\nwith   a   heart,  appreciating  and  recognising   that   every\r\n\r\nSingaporean is important and must feel as such.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that I would like to talk about is one\r\n\r\nof  racial harmony and the Prime Minister has touched about this\r\n\r\nearlier  on.  I would like to share with the House some  of  the\r\n\r\nissues that came about as we went through our process of getting\r\n\r\nfeedback from the various focus groups.  In the early stages  of\r\n\r\nour  discussion, I sensed a more in-depth study  was  needed  on\r\n\r\nthis  issue,  especially from the perspectives of  the  minority\r\n\r\ncommunities.  I therefore decided to conduct further focus group\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with the minority communities.  I had  a  total  of\r\n\r\nthree  such  discussions and I would like to share the  findings\r\n\r\nwith  this House.  And I also feel that we need to discuss these\r\n\r\nopenly  and  address them if we truly want to achieve excellence\r\n\r\nin  the area of racial harmony.  While legislation has been used\r\n\r\nas  one tool to ensure racial harmony in Singapore, I feel  that\r\n\r\nwe  need  to go beyond rules and regulations to ensure that  all\r\n\r\nraces  interact  and live happily with each other  so  that  our\r\n\r\nfundamentals of a multi-racial and multi-religious society  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to exist for a long time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the minorities' point of view, there are a number\r\n\r\nof issues.  First of all,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1525</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nawareness  and sensitivity.  If each one of us does not  make  a\r\n\r\nspecial  effort  to know the sensitivities and peculiarities  of\r\n\r\neach  other's  way of life, the danger is that  we  may  end  up\r\n\r\noffending  others without realising that we have  done  so.   In\r\n\r\nthis  respect, there is fear among the minority communities that\r\n\r\nI  spoke to that this lack of awareness is starting to emerge in\r\n\r\nour  society.  For example, one issue raised is that while  most\r\n\r\nmembers of the minority communities understood the need  of  the\r\n\r\nSpeak Mandarin Campaign, some felt that it is inappropriate  for\r\n\r\nthe  members  of  the Chinese community to break  into  speaking\r\n\r\nMandarin  when  people  of other races  who  do  not  understand\r\n\r\nMandarin are present in group discussions or in a meeting.  Many\r\n\r\nhave  felt offended, but are not expressing this concern openly.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, not knowing that Muslim's food preference has  to  be\r\n\r\nhalal  could  result  in a big problem.   Sir,  a  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague of mine thought that I am Tamil speaking.  I  did  not\r\n\r\nfeel  offended, but rather amused at the lack of  awareness  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of who I am after so many years  of  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.  If this trend continues, we may see an erosion of  the\r\n\r\nvalues that we have put in place for a multi-racial society  and\r\n\r\nthis needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that came out during the discussion with\r\n\r\nthe  minority communities was the SAP school that has been  much\r\n\r\ndebated  before.  The issue is not that the minority communities\r\n\r\ndo not support the concept of SAP school.  But the worry is that\r\n\r\nthe  future  leaders of our country would have  gone  through  a\r\n\r\nsystem of education without having much interaction  with people\r\n\r\nof  the  non-Chinese  race.  These same  people  would  then  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for making policies that affect other  races.   How\r\n\r\ncan  they  be  conversant of the sensitivities of  each  of  the\r\n\r\nminority  races  if they never had a real experience  of  mixing\r\n\r\nwith them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is not whether SAP schools are necessary. But\r\n\r\nwith  SAP schools present, how can we resolve this issue of  not\r\n\r\nbeing  aware  and  hence potentially making  mistakes  affecting\r\n\r\nsensitive  racial  issues in the future?  Our subject  committee\r\n\r\nrecommends that the twinning of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1526</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSAP  and  non-SAP schools be done as a solution.   Perhaps,  all\r\n\r\nECAs  should  be done at a twinning level if we want  to  ensure\r\n\r\ntrue  interaction.   Substantial  interaction  needs  to  happen\r\n\r\nthroughout the year if we want to make a real difference.  Doing\r\n\r\nit once or twice a year during multi-racial day is not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that came up was the effect of the\r\n\r\nethnic based self-help groups.  Whilst the objectives are  good,\r\n\r\nthey  have resulted in less help across ethnic and racial lines.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  the  current practice creates a real  danger  of  the\r\n\r\nvarious  races being alienated from one another.   Sir,  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat   when   I  grew  up,  there  was  much  more  inter-racial\r\n\r\ninteraction and we did not highlight the differences  among  the\r\n\r\nvarious  races  and  therefore  our  inter-racial  bonding   was\r\n\r\nstrengthened.  Today, our children are growing up with a greater\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the differences because of the way  we  organise,\r\n\r\neither  in  schools, for example, in SAP schools or  in  certain\r\n\r\nschools  where students studying the same mother tongue are  put\r\n\r\nin the same class, or through the various self-help groups.  Our\r\n\r\nsubject  committee  has suggested that we  promote  more  inter-racial  interaction by having an umbrella body for all self-help\r\n\r\ngroups,  so  that the various races can contribute towards  each\r\n\r\nother's  efforts.   We all need to think and  see  ourselves  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans first.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth issue that came out is the practice of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy.    One  unintended  impact  of  our   practice   of\r\n\r\nmeritocracy,  which  I must admit, is a transparent  system  and\r\n\r\napplies equally to all races.  It is because the members of  the\r\n\r\nminority  races,  the  Malays, Indians  and  Eurasians,  do  not\r\n\r\nperform  as  well  as  the Chinese in the academic  measures  of\r\n\r\nexaminations, they end up not being selected as scholars  or  to\r\n\r\nkey  positions  in Government, because of the  way  we  practise\r\n\r\nmeritocracy  by academic excellence alone.  While the  long-term\r\n\r\nsolution  has been correctly identified as one of uplifting  the\r\n\r\nacademic performances of the minority races, which the self-help\r\n\r\ngroups  are trying to do, I believe if we can change the way  we\r\n\r\nmeasure success and practise meritocracy to include non-academic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1527</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmeasures, this unintended effect can be easily resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue that I want to discuss, and this affects not\r\n\r\nonly  the minority communities, was brought up during our  other\r\n\r\nfocus group discussions, and that is our education system.  Many\r\n\r\nMembers   have  spoken  about  the  competitive  and   stressful\r\n\r\neducation system.  That, I must agree, has served us well in the\r\n\r\npast.   Our system of education, however, needs to be fine-tuned\r\n\r\nto  remove those elements that are not tolerant to failures  and\r\n\r\nare  not  forgiving  to  those who are late  developers.   I  am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the  early  streaming  in  our  schools  and  the\r\n\r\nsubsequent  streaming throughout the system which  I  feel  will\r\n\r\nresult in a class society in Singapore in the long-term,  if  we\r\n\r\nare not careful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the intent of streaming was to segregate students\r\n\r\ninto various capability levels and let each group develop at its\r\n\r\nown  pace,  I  feel  that in implementing,  the  educators,  the\r\n\r\nparents and the society have created a system where emphasis  is\r\n\r\nplaced  on  making the good better, and with the best  resources\r\n\r\nbeing used so that they will continue to improve and score  well\r\n\r\nand  the school's performance will improve.  We treat those  who\r\n\r\nare streamed into EM3 and into the Normal (Technical) stream  as\r\n\r\nfailures too early in the lives of our children.  In my opinion,\r\n\r\nwe  have  yet to see this class society developing in  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause this will only happen when the children who went through\r\n\r\nthis system become parents and have children of their own.   And\r\n\r\nI  see real danger of this happening in the future if we do  not\r\n\r\nput in efforts to change the system that we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share with the House two real examples that\r\n\r\nI came across.  One was during the focus group discussion that I\r\n\r\nhad  with one of the minority groups.  A young man aged mid-30s,\r\n\r\ntold  me  that  he was streamed into EM3, and then  into  Normal\r\n\r\n(Technical) stream and he later went to ITE.  He told me that he\r\n\r\nfelt very frustrated that he was treated as a failure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1528</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  as  an outcast and he felt very angry with the system.   He\r\n\r\neven contemplated suicide at one stage of his life.  Because  of\r\n\r\nhis  frustration, he felt that he had no place in the system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, fortunately, he self-motivated himself  and\r\n\r\nwanted  to prove to everyone that he is not a failure, and  that\r\n\r\nthe system was wrong in classifying him as one.  Today, he holds\r\n\r\na  Masters  degree and he is doing well in life.   He  is  still\r\n\r\nbitter  with the education system and fears for his children  if\r\n\r\nthey have to go through what he went through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another incident, during one of my meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsessions,  the parents of a 9-year old boy came to  see  me  and\r\n\r\nthey  sought  my help to appeal for their son to be  transferred\r\n\r\nfrom  EM3  to EM2 stream, and pleaded with me that if their  son\r\n\r\nremained in the EM3 stream, his life would be destroyed forever.\r\n\r\nAnd they made this comment in front of the child.  Our system is\r\n\r\nnot  forgiving and every one is responsible for this,  including\r\n\r\nour educators, parents and society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of self-esteem is also a serious one and I have\r\n\r\nseen this in the faces of those who came from the lower streams.\r\n\r\nI  would like to refer the House to an article which appeared in\r\n\r\nthe   Straits  Times  on  12  July  1998  regarding  the  Gifted\r\n\r\nProgramme.  It reads, \"Being Gifted is fine, but what if you are\r\n\r\nNormal.\"    This   article  was  written  by   a   20-year   old\r\n\r\nundergraduate who was selected for the Gifted Programme in 1998.\r\n\r\nLet  me  quote  from the article to illustrate my point  on  our\r\n\r\neducation system:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Recently, a friend of mine who taught both the GEP [which\r\n\r\nis  a  gifted  programme] and the non-GEP students as  a  relief\r\n\r\nteacher told me she thought that they were quite different  when\r\n\r\nit  came to self-esteem.   The GEP students were much more self-assured  and spoke up more often in class.  Girls in the  normal\r\n\r\nstream  were vocal, rowdy but have little self-esteem.  However,\r\n\r\nwe want to say it is not true that the practice of streaming and\r\n\r\nits  effect of slapping labels onto students does draw invisible\r\n\r\nlines that shape our self-confidence or the lack of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we segregate our children in the various streams, they\r\n\r\nmiss  out on the opportunity to learn from one another.  Putting\r\n\r\nall  the  slow  learners together is a self-defeating  approach.\r\n\r\nLet me quote from the article again:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1529</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As far as I know, there is not much interaction among the\r\n\r\ndifferent  streams.  It is almost an \"us against them\"  sort  of\r\n\r\nmentality sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>Hopefully, allowing the students to work together will let  them\r\n\r\nunderstand that they are alike in many ways.  And this was after\r\n\r\nthis writer made a recommendation that they should be spending a\r\n\r\nlot more time together rather than separate from one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to highlight that coming from a person\r\n\r\nwho  went  through the system, and who went through  the  better\r\n\r\npart  of  the system and feels this way about it, speaks volumes\r\n\r\nabout the need to change.  Let me quote the writer again:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"But the weeding out procedure of our education system\r\n\r\nwhich may be the most efficient is not entirely perfect since it\r\n\r\nis  difficult  to measure the potential of an individual.   Slow\r\n\r\nstarters or those who do not qualify as gifted in Primary 3 or 6\r\n\r\nmiss a precious opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the reality of our education system and of how all\r\n\r\nof  us, the schools, the parents and society are treating  those\r\n\r\nwho  are not academically well-off and late developers.  We have\r\n\r\nto  change  if  we  are  serious  about  the  notion  of  \"Every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  matters\".   I  am  hopeful  that  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will look into these issues when they  implement  the\r\n\r\n\"mass customisation\" approach to our education system, which the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education spoke about during the Budget debate this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would like to add that we have set the\r\n\r\nstage for changes in the way Singapore should be governed in the\r\n\r\nfuture.   Many recommendations we have made will require mindset\r\n\r\nchanges among all sectors of society.  We must ensure that every\r\n\r\none feels they have a useful role to play in the development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  that  they are valued as individuals  and  as  a\r\n\r\ncommunity.   While  our past approaches of nation-building  have\r\n\r\nworked,  the same approaches cannot ensure continued success  in\r\n\r\nthe   future.   Ultimately,  we  must  all  adopt  a  sense   of\r\n\r\nresponsibility  and ownership to want to make a  difference  and\r\n\r\nthe  key  ingredient that will make this work is the trust  that\r\n\r\nthe people, public and the private sectors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1530</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  in  each  other.  I am confident that  we  will  make  the\r\n\r\nnecessary changes because I see a determined PAP leadership  who\r\n\r\nwants  to make these changes and who is sincere in sharing  this\r\n\r\nvision that we have defined as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for being given an opportunity to be involved\r\n\r\nin  the S21 process and in helping to define the S21 Vision.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the people are wholeheartedly behind this  Vision.\r\n\r\nThe  6,000 or so people we consulted, each represents many  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  because we consulted leaders from various  sectors\r\n\r\nof society, and together, I strongly believe we have reached out\r\n\r\nto  a significant proportion of Singaporeans in arriving at  our\r\n\r\nVision.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to speak in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the motion standing in the name of the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report by the Singapore 21 Committee could not have\r\n\r\nbeen more timely.  As we prepare to face the next millennium, it\r\n\r\nis  right that we should collectively, as a nation, take a  step\r\n\r\nbackwards  and define what we want for the country in the  years\r\n\r\nahead.   Although Singapore has a relatively short  history,  we\r\n\r\nare, nevertheless, a country with our own identity, and well  on\r\n\r\nour  way  to  becoming a nation that all of us,  whether  we  be\r\n\r\nIndians, Chinese or others, can be proud of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 30 years, we as a people have gone through many\r\n\r\nmilestones  in  our  collective  memory.  We  can  think  of  us\r\n\r\nstruggling for independence or fighting with the communists,  or\r\n\r\novercoming   the  evils  of  communalism,  or  struggling   with\r\n\r\ncalamities and disasters, such as the Hotel New World  collapse,\r\n\r\nand,  most recently, the SilkAir crash of MI185.  Whatever these\r\n\r\nevents,  we cannot deny that the common experience has  got  the\r\n\r\npeople  closer together, either in common suffering or in common\r\n\r\ncelebration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our achievements in the last 30 years have made\r\n\r\nSingaporeans extremely\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1531</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nproud  of  themselves.   A  pride  that  sometimes  bordered  on\r\n\r\narrogance  and  is  seen  as  such  by  many  outsiders.   While\r\n\r\narrogance is not an attitude we want to encourage of our people,\r\n\r\nit nonetheless reflects the pride which our people have for this\r\n\r\ncountry. Taken in the right spirit, it is an attitude we want to\r\n\r\npreserve  and  build  upon so that our foundation  as  a  nation\r\n\r\nbecomes stronger with the passing years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision statement of the Singapore 21 Committee, in all\r\n\r\nits  component  parts,  must surely  lead  to  the  question  of\r\n\r\nstrengthening the country as a nation; a nation with an identity\r\n\r\nthat over time would become strong with a heart beating strongly\r\n\r\nfor  it.   How  do  we ensure that?  How will  opportunities  be\r\n\r\nperceived?  The Committee has, among other things, argued  quite\r\n\r\nrightly  that  the  Singapore of the 21st century  must  provide\r\n\r\nevery  opportunity  for  Singaporeans to pursue  their  personal\r\n\r\nrainbows, whether it be the arts, sports, entertainment or other\r\n\r\nareas.   Singapore of the future must continue  to  be  a  place\r\n\r\nwhere opportunities abound and where we can find here, the  same\r\n\r\noptimism as our forefathers did.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In seeking to provide these opportunities, one argument is\r\n\r\nthat  we  must  practise  an  open door  to  encourage  talented\r\n\r\nforeigners  to  come. By bringing in talented  foreigners,  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able  to  contribute  to  our  continued  growth   and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  and  in the process, help create  a  thriving  city\r\n\r\nwhich  provides  opportunities for all.  The  logic  behind  the\r\n\r\nargument of foreign talent is hard to fault.  I am, for one, all\r\n\r\nin  support of us bringing in foreign talent if, in the process,\r\n\r\nthese  foreigners  can  work  towards  the  fulfilment  of   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  dream.   However, while most  discussions  in  recent\r\n\r\nmonths  centred  around  the principle of  bringing  in  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent to Singapore, little has been said of the question of who\r\n\r\nis  a  foreign talent, and how can foreign talents be introduced\r\n\r\nto  this  country  without unduly upsetting the  present  social\r\n\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, nobody denies that foreign talents can make a\r\n\r\npositive contribution to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1532</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Singapore economy.  If a Nobel prize laureate were to set up\r\n\r\nhome  in Singapore, he would indeed qualify as a foreign talent.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if Bill Gates decides to migrate to Singapore, he\r\n\r\ntoo  would  qualify as a foreign talent.  Realistically,  it  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  that  Singapore would be attractive  enough  for  such\r\n\r\npeople.   For them, they are successful and there are  very  few\r\n\r\nreasons  why  they want to pull themselves out and  relocate  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are not talking about people in this class, one would\r\n\r\nsuppose  that we are talking about those who are good  in  their\r\n\r\nrespective fields but who are not necessarily in the  top  band.\r\n\r\nNonetheless,  these people may have the skills and expertise  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  contribution to Singapore.  If, by definition,  foreign\r\n\r\ntalent   refers  to  these  people,  the  question   that   many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have asked is, how can we identify these people  as\r\n\r\nthe  kind  of  people with the talents we want.  In  its  common\r\n\r\nusage  in  recent months, foreign talent has come to be  loosely\r\n\r\ntreated as being synonymous with those who have studied at  some\r\n\r\nrespected universities overseas and may have, perhaps,  acquired\r\n\r\nsome  working experience which may be of relevance to Singapore.\r\n\r\nPossibly,  some  of  these people may have  also  acquired  some\r\n\r\nproven  track  record as well.  And so it is that over  time  we\r\n\r\nhave  welcomed into our country many of these people from  China\r\n\r\nand India and elsewhere who possess these qualifications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said, I have no objection to foreign talents\r\n\r\ncoming  to Singapore to make a contribution.  However, one  must\r\n\r\nbe  very  careful in the way in which we collectively understand\r\n\r\nwhat  foreign  talent  means.  If foreign  talent  merely  means\r\n\r\ntaking  on board someone with a post-graduate degree, with  some\r\n\r\nrelevant working experience in some ritzy merchant banking house\r\n\r\nor  manufacturing concern, I am not sure if these  people  would\r\n\r\nqualify as true talents who can make a positive contribution  to\r\n\r\nour country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue, as some Singaporeans have seen it, is one of\r\n\r\nacquiring the relevant experience and expertise that Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1533</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneeds  to  propel  the  country into the 21st  century.   If  to\r\n\r\nacquire  the experience and expertise would mean going  overseas\r\n\r\nto  study  and  gaining the necessary working experience  before\r\n\r\nreturning  home as a talent, then we may be sending a  different\r\n\r\nmessage  to our people that it is not good enough to go  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal  universities and start their working career  here.   This\r\n\r\ncould well be an unintended effect of what we want to achieve in\r\n\r\nthe   long  run,  and  would  put  the  local  graduates  in   a\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged  position, vis-a-vis those who  went  overseas  to\r\n\r\nstudy  and  to  work.  The irony deepens even further  if  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  his  inability  to  qualify  for  a  university   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  person chooses to study  overseas  and  make  a\r\n\r\nsuccess  of it, acquires the relevant experience and comes  back\r\n\r\nas  a talent.  We may well ask how different is this person from\r\n\r\nthe  local  boy  who  spends his time faithfully  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nUnless we have a proper yardstick to define who a foreign talent\r\n\r\nis,  we  may  all  be deceiving ourselves if we merely  employed\r\n\r\nsomeone  with some qualification and treat him as a talent  when\r\n\r\nour own people can do the job just as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we are not able to carefully sift between the\r\n\r\nforeign  talent and those who merely want to come here  to  seek\r\n\r\nout  opportunities for work, we may sadly end up in a  situation\r\n\r\nwhere  Singaporeans  may find themselves out  of  a  job  simply\r\n\r\nbecause  foreigners  have displaced them  by  having  the  right\r\n\r\nassets, even if they may not be true talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On foreign talents, most Singaporeans would readily accept\r\n\r\nthe  position  if a foreign CEO was brought in to  run  a  local\r\n\r\ncompany.   However, one must realise that a foreign CEO  who  is\r\n\r\nasked to take charge of a company must have capable officers  to\r\n\r\nhelp  him fulfil his mandate.  A foreign CEO, who is brought  in\r\n\r\nto  run an organisation, would more likely than not be forced to\r\n\r\nreplace  the middle management with his own appointees as  well,\r\n\r\nsince   he  needs  to  perform  to  prove  his  worth   to   the\r\n\r\norganisation.  The CEO's appointees may not necessarily be local\r\n\r\nemployees.  In fact, they will, in all likelihood, be foreigners\r\n\r\nwhom he is familiar with.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1534</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese  managers who come in would equally be encouraged to  find\r\n\r\ntheir  own team members who can help them achieve their mandate.\r\n\r\nAnd  so  the displacement may just go down the corporate  chain.\r\n\r\nThe  question  is,  how can we ensure that  in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nseeking  these foreign talents to create opportunities  for  us,\r\n\r\nwe,   by   our  own  actions,  are  not  unwittingly  displacing\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who are equally able and capable  of  doing  these\r\n\r\njobs?    In   trying  to  create  a  vision  where  we   provide\r\n\r\nopportunities for all, the Government must be clear as   to  who\r\n\r\nthese  foreign  talents  are, the type  of  opportunities  these\r\n\r\nforeign  talents can create for Singaporeans and  the  assurance\r\n\r\nthat these are true opportunities and not lost opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us in Singapore, it is very important that the\r\n\r\nperception   of   opportunities  remains   among   Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  be  a place where opportunities  continue  to\r\n\r\nabound.   Otherwise,  it  would  be  very  difficult  indeed  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the strong heartbeat for Singapore that  we  want  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home is where the heart is, and home is also where\r\n\r\nopportunities are made available.  Where the members  feel  they\r\n\r\ndo not belong, it is no longer home, and where there is no home,\r\n\r\nthere is no heartbeat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us speak passionately about Singapore and its\r\n\r\nfuture.  I can understand this as Singapore is the only home  we\r\n\r\nknow.   Like  it  or  not, our destinies as a  people  are  tied\r\n\r\ntogether.   We have to make a success of this nation.  There  is\r\n\r\nno alternative.  I agree with the call of the Government that we\r\n\r\nmust  continue to keep the heart beating strongly for Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  our  people go overseas to work or to study or even migrate,\r\n\r\nthe  diaspora of Singaporeans around the world does  not  matter\r\n\r\nfor  us  as  long as wherever they are, whatever they do,  these\r\n\r\npeople can continue to know and remember their place of origin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turtles go to the beaches of Trengganu, I am told, to lay\r\n\r\neggs once a year.  And after the eggs are hatched, they will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1535</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscramble to the sea and travel all over the world.  But wherever\r\n\r\nthey  are,  the turtles always know their place of  origin   and\r\n\r\nwill  make  the  journey back faithfully to lay their  eggs,  to\r\n\r\nperpetuate themselves for posterity.  Equally, the Jews and  the\r\n\r\nChinese are spread all over the world.  They will always have  a\r\n\r\ndeep   remembrance  of  their  place  of  origin.   It  is  this\r\n\r\nassociation and connection with their place of origin  that  has\r\n\r\nbuilt  up  the  bonds  and the ties that will  hold  the  people\r\n\r\ntogether in a crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want Singaporeans to develop a stronger sense of\r\n\r\nbelonging and commitment to this country, whether they  live  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or overseas.  We must embrace this common  vision  of\r\n\r\nwhat this country stands for, what its values are and whether it\r\n\r\nis  worth  returning if one needs to.  At the end  of  the  day,\r\n\r\nthere  must be a conviction that this country is a country worth\r\n\r\nfighting and dying for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that all of us can actually play a part in shaping\r\n\r\nthis  country.  The more successful Singaporeans must carry  the\r\n\r\nadditional duty for other Singaporeans to help them embrace this\r\n\r\ncommon  vision.   This vision of Singapore as a  place  we  call\r\n\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was at a constituency dinner recently. The function\r\n\r\nwas  organised  for  the  purpose of  bringing  together  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens  from old folks homes to Tampines Central  for  dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  can assure Members of this House that we did not  charge\r\n\r\nthem  $300 for coming to Tampines.  Anyway, the elderly citizens\r\n\r\nwho are residents of these homes are there because they have  no\r\n\r\none  to  turn  to.   They  are essentially  abandoned  by  their\r\n\r\nchildren.  Although they are abandoned by their children,  there\r\n\r\nwas  no  lack  of  love  that was shown for  them  by  the  many\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who  were  there to help.  I  could  see  how  these\r\n\r\nresidents  tenderly  looked after and gently  escorted  the  old\r\n\r\nfolks  whenever they needed to leave the table.  These  are  all\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who  give their time freely for  community  service.\r\n\r\nAnd it is impressions like these that essentially\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwarm  my  heart and make me realise the true meaning of  calling\r\n\r\nSingapore  home, a place where we all feel as one big family  in\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans living overseas, we must endeavour to keep\r\n\r\nthe  heart  beating  beyond  the first  generation.   Singapore,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, does not have a history long and deep enough  for\r\n\r\nit  to  have  a cultural DNA that Singaporeans, no matter  where\r\n\r\nthey are, can pass from one generation to another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the first generation of living overseas, children\r\n\r\nborn  of Singaporean parents would no longer have any attachment\r\n\r\nto  Singapore unless they spend some time at home.   If  we  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to  accept a diaspora of Singaporeans,  then  I  would\r\n\r\nencourage and urge our Government to give some attention to  see\r\n\r\nhow we can keep this heartbeat going for Singaporeans overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our gathering here today marks a milestone in our\r\n\r\nnational history which signifies renewal as well as change.   We\r\n\r\nalone hold in our mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of\r\n\r\nill-will and distrust among fellow Singaporeans, and all  manner\r\n\r\nof  differences in the name of a much better future we  want  to\r\n\r\ncreate for ourselves and our children.  These commitments spring\r\n\r\nforth from the beliefs for which our forebears fought so hard to\r\n\r\nestablish.   We dare not forget today that we are heirs  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst revolution.  The revolution brought on by our pioneers has\r\n\r\ngiven us life in Singapore as we know it.  Let us go forth  from\r\n\r\nthis  time and place to tell our friends and our foes alike that\r\n\r\nwe  intend to keep the heart beating strongly for Singapore  and\r\n\r\nfor  many  more generations of Singaporeans to come.  Let  every\r\n\r\nnation  know whether they wish us well or ill that we shall  pay\r\n\r\nany  price,  bear  any  burden, meet any hardship,  support  any\r\n\r\nfriend,  oppose any foe, to assure the survival and  success  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This much, we must pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1536</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That the debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1537</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Debate to be continued on what day, RAdm\r\n\r\nTeo?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Tomorrow, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1538</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Seven</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Minutes to Six o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
