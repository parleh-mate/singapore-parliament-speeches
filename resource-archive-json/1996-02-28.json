The increase is necessary to provide for the revision in the pay of the President in July 1995. An increase in the provision for Entertainment from $62,000 to $80,000 is also needed to meet the larger number and higher costs of official functions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for Salaries of Personal Staff is increased from $2,908,900 to $3,176,500 to cater for normal salary increments and filling of vacancies. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A provision of $732,000 is needed for Expenses of Household.

A lower provision is needed because the President has decided not to purchase a new car in FY95 but to retain the existing one. Provision has therefore to be made in FY96 for payment of the prevailing vehicle quota premium for this car. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions in the Schedule to the Civil List as indicated in the Motion before the House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, pursuant to section 7 of the Civil List and Pension Act (Chapter 44), resolves that the Schedule to that Act be varied by deleting the figures \"$1,341,300\", \"$62,000\", \"$2,908,900\", \"$737,300\" and \"$351,500\", in the second column and substituting the figures \"$1,556,100\", \"$80,000\", \"$3,176,500\", \"$732,000\" and \"$216,100\", respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 770</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1996 to 31st March, 1997. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>I REVIEW OF THE ECONOMY</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN 1995</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore economy had another good year. Overall growth was 8.9%, with strong showing in manufacturing, transport &amp; communications and commerce. This reflected the strength of the global electronics cycle and buoyant regional growth. For the period 1990-95, Singapore_s economic growth averaged 8.5% per annum, better than \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 771</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the other Asian Newly Industrialised Economies and about the same as Malaysia and Thailand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strong growth performance has led to continued cost pressures. The Unit Labour Cost (ULC) Index for the manufacturing sector rose by 0.9% in 1995. Our relative competitiveness in manufacturing worsened in 1995. The Relative Unit Labour Cost Index in US$ against the NIEs grew by 9.1%. This was due to the appreciation of the Singapore dollar and larger increases in ULC against Hong Kong and Taiwan. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, consumer price inflation moderated because of the strong Singapore dollar, weaker sentiments in the property and stock markets, and keen competition in the retail industry. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external economy continued to grow in tandem with the domestic economy. Factor income from abroad accounted for 12% of GNP, compared with 11% for 1994 [Defined as foreign income from abroad (FIFA) as a percentage of the sum of GDP and FIA.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good economic performance has meant real progress for our citizens. In the last ten years, per capita income increased by 5.9% per annum in real terms. Real wages rose by 3.8% per annum. In 1995, 90% of our households owned their own homes, up from the 73% in 1985. Singapore has also made good progress in a wide range of socio-economic indicators (Table 1 (Cols. 807 - 808)). \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1996/19960228/19960228-HA-0650807.htm\">Table 1 - SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS (Cols. 807 - 808)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong economic growth and sound public finances have enabled the Government to enhance the assets of citizens, by upgrading HDB flats, and selling at a discount Singapore Telecom shares, HDB shops and hawker stalls. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>OUTLOOK FOR 1996</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for the external environment remains positive, but sentiments in Europe and the US have turned less optimistic in recent months. Regional growth is also expected to be lower after strong growth in recent years. Prospects \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 772</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> for the electronics industry remain bright though growth in demand is expected to moderate from that in 1995. With slightly slower growth in external demand and continued pressure on costs and competitiveness, the Singapore economy is likely to see slower growth in 1996. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has therefore retained its earlier forecast of 7-8% growth for 1996. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>MEDIUM-TERM GROWTH OUTLOOK</h4>\n  </div> Singapore has enjoyed faster growth than we had thought possible in 1986. Then, the Ministry of Trade and Industry had projected our long-term indigenous growth rate to be 4-6%. This 4-6% represented the supply-side growth potential for the Singapore economy in the next 30-40 years if no more new foreign workers were allowed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, growth has averaged 8.5% in the last 10 years. This is due to two important developments, one external and one domestic. Since the late 1970s, there has been a wave of economic reform and liberalisation in Asia. China_s economic reform programme in 1978 led first to a boom in trade via Hong Kong and then to an upsurge in foreign direct investments into China. 1993 was a record year when China saw foreign direct investment approvals reach US$110 billion. The transformation in ASEAN was no less dramatic. Indonesia liberalised foreign investment in 1983, Malaysia and Thailand in 1986. India, after years of pursuing economic self-reliance, opened up in 1991. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberalisation has made the region as a whole more attractive to foreign investors. Furthermore, ASEAN_s move to liberalise and deregulate their economies coincided with rising cost pressures in Japan and the NIEs and hence increased the outflow of foreign direct investment from these countries. Foreign direct investment into the ASEAN countries, China and India rose dramatically, from US$20 billion in 1988 to US$160 billion in 1995. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exports by Asian countries (excluding Japan) also saw dramatic growth. Between 1985 and 1995, exports grew by 17% per annum, compared with 14% per annum between 1975 and 1985. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in trade and investment linkages has resulted in closer economic integration of the Asian economies. For Singapore, regional growth has given an added boost to the economy and cushioned us against slower growth in the OECD countries over the last 5 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, we have expanded our supply-side growth potential due to three factors. First, the female labour participation rate has increased from 45% in 1985 to 50% in 1995. Second, the workforce has expanded faster than we had anticipated, partly because of higher immigration and partly because we have allowed in more foreign workers who now account for about 1 in 5 workers. Third, our years of investments in education, training and infrastructure are now paying off in higher productivity growth. Productivity growth during 1985-95 averaged 4.7% per annum, higher than the 4.0% per annum recorded in the preceding 10 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better labour productivity performance has been accompanied by a trend of improving Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. Since the recovery from recession in 1986, TFP growth has averaged 2.8% per annum compared with the -1.4% during 1974-86. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI_s projection is for growth potential to be about 7% per annum for the next 5 years. In good years, we may do better but with consequences like rising costs and a tight labour market. In weaker years, growth may fall below 7%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because Singapore is so heavily dependent on external demand, we must adapt to changes in the environment. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MEETING FUTURE CHALLENGES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the economy on course for about 7% annual growth will be a real challenge. The nature of global \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> competition has changed with the entry of new and big players, like China and India into the international economy. Closer home, as ASEAN countries progress, they will increasingly compete against us for foreign investments, even as their development generates new opportunities for economic cooperation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, economic growth has averaged 8.9% per year in the last 8 years. Per capita incomes have grown by 6.3% per year in real terms. Malaysians are proud of their country_s achievements, and are galvanised by Vision 2020 to make Malaysia a developed country. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia has been systematically building up a diversified manufacturing base. In recent years it has attracted industrial projects that are as sophisticated as those coming to Singapore. They include high-end activities like disk drives and wafer fabrication, which Singapore is also pursuing. The productivity and quality at electronics factories in Penang are high. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In successive budgets, the Malaysian government has liberalised the economy by lowering or abolishing tariffs, and promoted more competition in both the manufacturing and services sectors. It has improved the business environment, and relied on sound policies, a conducive business climate, and skilled manpower to move up the technology ladder. It has introduced tax incentives similar to ours, like Operational Headquarters (OHQ) incentives for both manufacturing and services and pioneer status for wafer fabrication companies. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore welcomes Malaysia_s pro-growth economic policies, even though Malaysia_s success will put pressure on Singapore. We will just have to push ahead, raise our skill and productivity levels, and continue to attract still higher quality investments here, if we are not to be displaced. This pressure to improve ourselves is positive and constructive. Malaysia_s success is an opportunity, not a threat to Singapore. It opens up fresh possibilities for win-win economic cooperation, and much closer trade, investment and business linkages \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 775</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> between our two countries. A more prosperous and self-confident region makes for a better environment for further growth, even as healthy competition pushes each country to achieve its best. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestically, our lack of domestic market, small size and ageing population can become handicaps. For Singapore to continue to attract manufacturing and services investments, we need to remain significantly more efficient than other countries. We must mobilise and maximize our resources to respond to the exciting changes in the business world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, major semi-conductor companies are racing to build new capacity, to meet the severe worldwide shortage of semiconductors. EDB is working hard to attract some of these wafer fabs to Singapore. The Singapore port had another record year in terms of containers handled but faces keener competition as regional ports gear up for a slice of the transhipment business. In financial services, new forms of service delivery like automated teller machines, Internet banking and electronic cash cards are being introduced. Several cities in the region are gearing up to become financial centres, and rival Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must respond to and take advantage of these business changes. We need to strike a judicious balance between long-term strategic considerations and tactical moves in the short- to medium-term. This will help us to set our sights on a steady growth path while accepting temporary deviations from trend. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government_s basic philosophy is to keep the supply-side fundamentals sound and ride on opportunities as they arise, in order to strengthen our long term competitiveness. We must improve our own performance in an expanding market, instead of hoping that our competitors or potential competitors will fail. Much as some sections of the business community would like us to, we cannot artificially depress cost levels or resort to protectionist measures to gain an advantage over the competition. These palliatives are detrimental to economic efficiency. They will slow down growth and cause us to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 776</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> misallocate and waste resources. This will benefit nobody in the long term. This is what economists mean when they speak of distortions to supply and demand. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important way to avoid distortions is to price factors of production correctly. The prices of key inputs to the economy, such as land, labour, electricity, fuel, and telecommunication services must reflect their scarcity and the cost of producing them. For example, the cost of electricity includes the cost of the fuel oil or natural gas consumed, the manpower costs of Singapore Power staff, the rental or depreciation of the equipment used as well as the land occupied by the power stations and grid. In addition, the cost also includes the cost of the capital in the form of loans and equity which finances Singapore Power_s business. In the case of loans, this cost is the interest on the borrowings. In the case of equity, this cost is a competitive rate of return on the equity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pricing factors of production too high places a burden on the rest of the economy, and damages economic growth. But pricing them too low - ie below the cost of producing them, including the cost of capital - is also harmful, as it encourages over-consumption of these resources. When consumers and firms do not see or bear the true cost of these factors, they will use these factors even when they are worth less to them than what they really cost. As a result, instead of adding value, they will be subtracting value. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is painful to have to raise prices of important factors of production like electricity, because this affects almost all households and firms. Yet these are precisely the resources where mis-pricing does the greatest harm. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former Soviet Union and the Communist countries of Eastern Europe, provide a dramatic if extreme example of the harm caused by mis-pricing key factors of production. These centrally-planned economies deliberately under-priced factors of production like oil, coal, electricity and steel, and then allocated them to favoured industries and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 777</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> consumers by central command, instead of by using market forces. They believed that oil, electricity, etc. were \"strategic\" sectors of the economy, and that pricing these resources cheaply would reduce costs for the targeted consumers of these resources, and help them to grow faster. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the results massively disappointed these hopes. Far from low factor prices boosting the economy, they distorted structures of production so badly that sometimes the real value of the output was even less than the value of the material inputs. The Economist described it as: \"Valuable metal, plastic, cardboard, rubber, energy go in at one end; Trabant cars worth less than the sum of these parts emerge at the other. [\"The value-substractors of Eastern Europe\" in The Economist, 5 Jan 91]. Eventually the whole system collapsed. The former Eastern European countries have, to varying degrees, carried out economic reforms. The adjustment to a market economy has been a very painful process for them, particularly in Russia, where it has caused major social and political upheaval. They have all had to recognise explicitly what has always been the case, that under-pricing energy and other inputs have a market price and an opportunity cost, and this true cost was much higher than the nominal price the central planners had set. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is far from the predicament of the former Communist economies. But it is the same logic which forces us to recognise that Singapore Power_s electricity tariffs are too low, and that we must raise them gradually over several years, to enable SP to earn an adequate return on its capital. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we make these adjustments promptly when they become necessary, we need to make only small changes each time, and the process need not be a traumatic one. This is the real reason for raising SP's tariffs. It is not to raise more money for the Government, or to enable the Government to float SP on the stock exchange. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans ask: why does the Government need to raise SP_s tariffs and other government charges, when it runs comfortable budget surpluses? The answer is that when the Government runs surpluses, it will share the fruits of growth with Singaporeans. But it must do so in ways which help Singaporeans build up their assets and strengthen their stakes in Singapore, and not ways which hinder the working of our economy, and damage the growth on which our future depends. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amounts which the Government has given back to the people, in the form of HDB housing subsidies, rebates on service and conservancy charges and HDB flat rentals, SOTUS share top-up schemes, and discounted Singapore Telecom shares, are much larger than the additional revenue which SP will earn from the higher tariffs. Later I shall be announcing a scheme of rebates to PUB bills for lower income HDB households. The amounts per household from this new rebate alone will also exceed by many times the projected increase in their electricity bills. This proves the point that the purpose of the SP tariff revision is not to enable the Government to collect more money, but to get an important factor of production, namely electricity, priced correctly, so that our economy will function properly and grow, to benefit all Singaporeans. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other supply-side fundamentals. These are: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) keeping the business environment clean and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;efficient, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) maintaining prudent and stable macroeconomic \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policies, and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) improving human resources. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortune magazine has ranked Singapore the Number One city to do business in. This is not because Singapore has the lowest cost, but because Singapore is an easy place to do business in. Singapore may be more expensive in terms of upfront costs, but there are no hidden extras. This is no accident but a matter of design. There should be no slackening of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 779</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> standards of integrity and efficiency in Singapore even as we adapt our practices to suit the different markets in which we invest. Singapore is welcomed as an investor in the region partly because of the way we do business and our reputation. This \"brand name\" distinguishes us from other investors and should not be tarnished. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prudent and stable macroeconomic environment creates the best conditions to sustain investor confidence. Consistently low inflation, a strong currency, sound public finances with low taxes, and a triple-A credit rating reduces to a minimum the risk of investing in Singapore. The Government_s conservative fiscal policy has enabled us to build infrastructure and pay for essential public services like education and basic health care while setting aside savings for future needs. Later, I will discuss in greater detail how fiscal policy can be further refined to maintain competitiveness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore faces keener international competition, the quality of our human resource becomes a critical competitive advantage. So far, investors have been prepared to pay a premium because they recognise the quality of our workers, and because our overall business environment enables them to make the most of their workers here. But this edge is a finite one, and we cannot take it for granted. We need to educate and train each Singaporean to his maximum potential in economically relevant areas. We also need to press on with the flexible wage system, and avoid ossifying cost levels and structures as the labour force ages. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the developed countries, especially in Europe, wage costs are inflated by social security taxes and other non-wage payments, as well as shorter working hours and longer paid holidays. For every $1 of wage cost to employers, 25 to 30 cents go towards taxes and levies in these countries. In Singapore, the proportion is only 16%, due mainly to employers_ contributions to the Central Provident Fund (CPF). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a fundamental difference between the CPF and social security taxes \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 780</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> in other countries. Our CPF contributions, though compulsory, are not put in a common pool to be re-distributed to others. CPF savings belong to individual members who can use them for their retirement needs and to buy a home or invest in a wide range of instruments like education, shares, gold and property. Furthermore, the level of discretionary savings is high. Even with $66 billion worth of savings in the CPF, Singaporeans have $20 billion worth of deposits with the POSB and another $72 billion with commercial banks. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on fundamentals is sound, as they, unlike short-term cost advantages, are harder to replicate. Getting the fundamentals right is a matter of building sound institutions, investing for the long-term, and continuously building on and improving our systems. There are no short-cuts and no compromises. Meticulous attention to detail ensures the success of our plans. Fortunately for us, these competitive advantages also take some time to be eroded. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, China has an enormous number of highly talented workers, professionals and government administrators. But China will take many years to build up the institutions, the management systems, the legal framework, and the respect for transparent, impartial rules, all of which are necessary before talented individuals can work together to realise their full potential running outstanding organisations. China realises this, and is working hard to master this _software_. The Suzhou Industrial Park project is only one of the ways China is trying to pick up ideas from other countries, adapt them to local conditions, and then apply them in more areas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we are mindful that the world around us is changing. What works for one industry today may not work for another industry tomorrow. We must never mistake a sea change for _noise_ and fail to respond. We need to keep our ears close to the ground, keep in close touch with our customers and find out what they want. We then adjust our policies to ride on opportunities as they arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 781</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always taken a developmental approach. It will customise advantages to suit the needs of different investors, especially those who can make a significant contribution to Singapore_s economic development. We have used tax incentives like pioneer status extensively over the years. But increasingly, other countries, better endowed than us, are offering similar or even better incentives to ride the global electronics boom, while investors are looking for more partnerships to share the high costs of product and market development. So we have adapted our tactics, eg, by co-investing with investors in strategic projects or by setting aside enough land for key projects. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is an upsurge in demand, the Government has made supply-side adjustments, like relaxing controls on foreign workers, so that companies_ operations are not hampered. We are also consciously streamlining paperwork and red tape in order to cut down response time to investors. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>ROLE OF FISCAL POLICY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government_s fiscal policy aims to provide a stable and conducive environment for the private sector to thrive. Our target is to contain expenditure within operating revenue and run a modest budget surplus over the long run, so that the public sector does not drain resources from the economy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our budget surpluses have averaged 4.4% of GDP over the last 8 years. This healthy state of public finances is the result of careful expenditure and buoyant revenue. The Government has been very careful with its expenditure. It has embarked on projects only on their own merits, and not just because it has the money. Yet, we have not in any way stinted on investments for economic and social purposes. 30% of government expenditure is devoted to development projects, like building schools, hospitals, roads and parks. Investors and analysts rate our infrastructure highly. Our people enjoy good public amenities and a high quality of life. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 782</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, despite successive reductions in income tax rates, collections have risen because of strong economic growth. At the same time, non-tax measures like Certificates of Entitlement (COEs) and Foreign Workers Levy, which were introduced for purposes other than revenue, have developed into significant revenue sources. These revenue sources are not as stable as taxes. They are likely to fall sharply in a recession, as demand for foreign workers falls, and Singaporeans have less to spend on buying cars. But because of their size, they must nevertheless be taken into account in our macroeconomic policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government_s budget surpluses have not been a drag on the economy. Economic growth has remained high, and in some years has in fact exceeded the long term sustainable rate. The surpluses have enabled the Government to enhance the wealth of Singaporeans in good years, through schemes like the HDB upgrading programme and the Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. There is therefore no reason for us to be apologetic about our budget surpluses or to make drastic changes to fiscal policy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the longer term, our surpluses give us the flexibility to look ahead at how best our fiscal policy can support continued growth. As the Singapore economy matures, its growth will gradually slow down. When this happens, the Government will have room to reduce taxes, to strengthen incentives for individuals to do well, take risks, and save, in order to promote investment and economic growth, without running into a budget deficit. In previous Budgets, I had mentioned a target of 25% for the corporate tax rate and 12% for the property tax rate. Provided we continue to keep a tight rein on expenditure, these rates should still enable us to set aside a modest surplus to meet contingencies and cope with any unexpected economic downturns. I will elaborate on this year_s adjustments later in Part III. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, our surpluses enable the Government to take non-tax measures to benefit those who pay little or no taxes, like remission of HDB conservancy and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> service charges for lower-income households, or the Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme. On the expenditure side, the Government will continue to evaluate projects on their economic merits. No worthwhile project will be held back. In fact the Government will make a special effort to conceive and implement projects which achieve specific social objectives. One good example is the Edusave Merit Bursary scheme, which has helped us to reach out to a large number of young Singaporeans from lower income families, and encouraged them to study hard in order to uplift themselves and their families. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONCLUSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not possible for us to have perfect information about the future, we do know that some things never change, like Singapore_s small size and the keener competition that we will face. We therefore must be prepared for the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has many good things going for it. We occupy a strategic location in Asia, the next economic powerhouse of the world. Domestically, we have a competent Government, a hardworking and rational people, sound institutions and, above all, the will to succeed. I am therefore confident that we will be among the more prosperous cities of an affluent Asia in the 21st century. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>II THE FY96 BUDGET</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will move on to the Budget for the next financial year. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXPENDITURE POLICY</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our expenditure policies will continue to focus on building a competitive economy. The strategy is to channel more funds into productive infrastructure and into areas which yield lasting returns and support growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our philosophy is to promote a cohesive, resilient and upwardly mobile society. We will therefore continue to spend heavily on education, primary healthcare, public housing and community development. As we are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> approaching developed country status, our aim is also to develop a more gracious society. More funds will therefore be allocated for the development of the arts, recreation and sports. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government will also continue to restrain growth in the size of Government. This will free more human and financial resources for the private sector to play its role as the engine of growth. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's budgetary policy is to ensure that all expenditures are met from operating revenues. Income from investments is retained in reserves to preserve their real value. Singapore has few natural resources. Our financial reserves therefore constitute our national wealth and resources. They are critical, not only to see us through times of crisis, but also to secure investor confidence in our future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of continued strong economic growth, the FY96 budget is expected to yield a surplus. Some of this can therefore be channelled to augment Medifund and Edusave. I propose a contribution of $100 million to Medifund to ensure that healthcare remains affordable to all, and another $500 million to Edusave to broaden the choice and enhance the quality of education for our young. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <h4>THE FY96 EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</h4>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total expenditure in FY96 will amount to $18.9 billion or 14.4% of GDP. As in previous years, Social and Community Services will take the largest share at 42%. Education alone accounts for half of this. The rest will go into healthcare, public housing subsidy, the environment, community development, and information and the arts. National security accounts for the next largest share at 36%. Spending on economic and infrastructural development accounts for 12% of the expenditure estimates, which includes the development of the transportation system, civil works, research and development, the upgrading of our economy and workforce, and the promotion of inward investments and regionalisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now elaborate on the FY96 expenditure proposals. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Operating Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operating expenditure in FY96 is projected to increase by $0.9 billion to $12.8 billion, a 8% increase over FY95. As a percentage of total operating expenditure, defence accounts for the largest share at 42%, followed by education at 24%. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From FY96, operating expenditures have been classified into Running Costs and Transfers. Running Costs refer to the day-to-day operating expenditures of Government. It includes manpower and other operating costs. Transfers on the other hand refer to payments made by Government to the public and outside organisations. They include payments for public assistance. Scholarships, compensations, direct subsidies, contributions to local and international organisations are also classified as Transfers, as these are grants to bodies outside the civil service to carry out approved programmes. This reclassification will provide a better picture of the actual cost of running and maintaining government's services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For FY96, Running Costs and Transfers will amount to $11.9 billion and $0.9 billion respectively. Compared to FY95, Running Costs will be higher by 7.4%, while Transfers will be higher by 15.2%. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <i>Development Expenditure</i> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development expenditure in FY96 is estimated at $6.1 billion, a slight decrease of $0.3 billion compared to FY95 and accounting for 32% of total expenditures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development spending on education will be significantly higher in FY96. The bulk of it will go into the building of new schools, technical institutes and tertiary institutions, and improving facilities in existing ones. Specific projects include building a permanent campus for Nanyang Polytechnic, boarding facilities for Nanyang Girls' High School, upgrading of the NUS campus, and the relocation of NIE to NTU. To prepare our young for the information age, the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Government will also invest heavily in upgrading computer facilities in schools and tertiary institutions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development spending on healthcare is largely for building new hospitals and medical institutes, and upgrading existing ones to provide quality healthcare service. The major provisions are for the construction of a combined Institute of Health/National Dental Centre, the New Changi Hospital, NUH Phase 3 development, the new Kandang Kerbau Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and the Communicable Disease Centre. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on civil defence and other projects of the Ministry of Home Affairs is set to double with projects such as the Civil Defence School, civil defence shelters, a new Immigration Building, redevelopment of the Woodlands Checkpoint and building a new checkpoint at the second crossing to Malaysia. Funds have also been provided to upgrade and replace operational and training equipment to further enhance the operational readiness of our Police and the Civil Defence forces. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is committed to maintaining the free-flow of people and goods on our roads. The on-going programme to widen and upgrade roads and expressways, and construct junction interchanges will continue. The ERP Project is making good progress. In public transport, the Woodlands MRT Extension has been completed on schedule and below budget and came into operation on 10th February 1996. A decision has also been taken to proceed immediately with the North-East MRT Line and the Bukit Panjang LRT and to bring them into operation as soon as possible. Funds are also provided for feasibility studies into new MRT and LRT lines, such as the Marina LRT. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital subsidy on public housing is expected to increase in FY96 to $903 million. Half of this will go towards subsidising new flats and paying for the discount on the sale of HDB tenanted shops and rental flats. The upgrading of HDB flats, including interim upgrading to improve older estates, takes up a significant portion of the balance. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development funds are also set aside to enhance social cohesion, strengthen the fabric of society, and promote healthy living. These will be used to develop, upgrade and maintain our sports facilities, upgrade Residents Committee Centres, construct a new Grassroots Recreation Club, and develop Community Centres/Clubs and Child Care Centres. Provisions are also made to develop homes for the aged and facilities for disabled and low income families. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The programme to cover sewage treatment works to reduce smell nuisance will continue. The development of an offshore sanitary landfill on Pulau Semakau is in progress. Land reclamation works are currently underway on Sentosa Cove, Jurong Island, the Southern Islands, Tuas View and Changi East. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R&amp;D expenditure is budgeted at $238 million or 0.18% of GDP. Of this, $197 million will be managed by NSTB for the promotion of economically relevant R&amp;D. The balance is set aside to promote academic and medical research under the Academic and Medical Research Funds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Assistance Scheme will be extended for another 5-year term to develop our human resources, upgrade local companies, draw in strategic investments and help our local companies venture into the region. A sum of $58.5 million has been provided for FY96. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now update the House on what is being done by Government to achieve greater efficiency and accountability in public expenditures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service is in the process of introducing fundamental reforms to its management and control system. This will have wide-ranging impact in the way public sector organisations operate. The goal is to create a public sector which will provide higher quality service at lower cost through better management practices. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain the need for this reform. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 788</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years our public sector has been kept lean and efficient, and has provided an efficient, honest and competent public service. This has contributed to our economic growth and competitiveness. However, there is no room for complacency. We cannot take for granted that what has worked well for us so far will also see us through the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is entering a new stage of development. We are approaching developed country status, and face intense competition not only from low-cost developing countries that are fast catching up, but also from advanced countries in a rapidly changing and highly competitive external environment. On the domestic front, the emergence of a generation of better educated Singaporeans and an ageing population means higher expectations of and demands on all aspects of public services. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response cannot simply be to expand the size of Government. The experience of many developed countries has shown that unrestricted expansion of bureaucracies, even with the best of intentions, just leads to bloated and inefficient public sectors. The result is not better services but higher taxes to finance the cost of Government, which in turn becomes a drag on the economy. Indeed, many developed countries which expanded their public sectors during good times are now taking painful steps to downsize and cut back. Others cannot do so for lack of political will. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the challenges ahead, we need a first class Civil Service that can create the conditions for Singapore to stay ahead of competition and, at the same time, provide a level of public services that will meet Singaporeans' aspirations. To do this, civil servants need more autonomy than is possible under the existing structure, which is built around centralised control. We cannot accept a Civil Service mindset that places compliance above initiative, process above people and rules above flexibility. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no different from what progressive business organisations are doing in response to changes to their \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 789</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> environment. All over the world, well-run corporations are dismantling internal bureaucracies, empowering front-line employees, focusing on quality and getting closer to customers in order to stay ahead of competitors. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service will be restructured along similar lines. We have called this process Budgeting For Results, or BFR for short. Under BFR, all government units such as Ministries and Departments will be managed as autonomous agencies. Each autonomous agency, or AA in short, will have considerable autonomy in financial and personnel management in exchange for greater accountability for the results to be achieved with the public funds allocated to them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now explain briefly how the AA and BFR system works: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, every government unit will be required to specify its outputs and set performance targets as part of the annual budgeting process. That is, they must identify the results to be achieved with their budget allocations. These targets will be monitored and will form the basis for evaluating the performance of the units. For example, the National Registration Department has set a target of issuing ICs within 14 days. Previously this took about 21 days. Under BFR, Permanent Secretaries will be accountable for achieving their targets. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a unit's operating budget will depend on its output levels. The driving force of the budgeting process will shift from resource requirements to output levels. For example, Toa Payoh and Tampines Polyclinics will be funded this year based on the number of patients they serve. Immigration Department will be funded by the number of persons cleared at checkpoints as well as the number of passports issued. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For units whose output and services are not easily measured, their operating budget will be allowed to grow roughly at the nominal GDP growth rate. In these cases, GDP growth rate is used as a proxy for output growth. When applied across \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 790</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the board, the effect of this is to limit the share of the economy taken up by the public sector. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as an incentive for better financial management, Ministries will be allowed to carry forward a portion of their savings to the next financial year. Such savings may be used to finance new programmes, purchase capital equipment or meet future contingencies. This will discourage the rush to use up operating budgets at year end. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, units will be given maximum autonomy to achieve their goals. For instance, Permanent Secretaries will be allowed to increase their headcount to cope with increases in workload or initiate new activities within the agreed budget. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements of AA and BFR will be introduced progressively in all Ministries, Departments, Organs of States and Government-funded Statutory Boards over a two-year period. From FY96, 14 Government Departments, including three Ministry HQs will start operating as AAs. The rest of the Civil Service will be managed as AAs by FY97. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quality and efficiency of the public sector is a major contributor to the competitiveness of a country. BFR should enable us to maintain and improve on our competitiveness. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>III REVENUE AND TAX CHANGES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me turn next to the fiscal position and the proposed tax changes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GDP growth in 1996 is forecast at 7-8%, in line with our medium term growth potential. Revenue collection is expected to be $26.0 billion. With operating and development expenditures budgeted at $18.9 billion, a surplus of $7.1 billion is anticipated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive GST of 3% has been implemented for 2 years since April 1994. GST revenue collection in FY95 is projected to be $1.6 billion. This is less than the value of the GST offset package, which is estimated at $1.8 billion. Hence, the introduction of GST continues to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 791</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> revenue negative, as the Government had promised. The implementation of GST has generally gone smoothly but we will continue to fine-tune procedures to facilitate the conduct of businesses. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GST has broadened our tax base and put us in a strong position to take the reform of our tax system a stage further. The Government_s basic aim is to simplify the tax system and tax factors of production as lightly as possible. A simplified tax system facilitates compliance and lowers both administrative and business costs. The strong revenues from levies imposed for specific purposes, such as COE and foreign workers levy, help to keep our direct and indirect taxes as low as possible. Lighter taxes will strengthen incentives for the population to work, save and grow the economy. The level of taxation needed depends on the Government's spending requirements. So long as the Government continues to be prudent with its expenditure, there will be no need to tax the economy heavily. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the growth outlook in 1996 remains buoyant, there is no pressing need to stimulate the economy with drastic tax cuts. However, margins in some business sectors have been squeezed by rising manpower costs and the strong Singapore dollar. There is therefore a case for continuing our policy of gradually reducing Government levies and taxes in order to reduce business costs and improve profitability. We will also fine-tune tax incentives to promote high value-added activities and encourage investments in equipment for pollution control and the conservation of water and energy. Also, while tax incentives will continue to be used, other incentives, such as equity participation, grants and loans, will play a greater role to supplement tax incentives in attracting desirable activities. Human capital will be an increasingly important source of comparative advantage for the economy. To compete for and retain talent, the Government is committed to lowering the tax burden on individuals whenever its fiscal position allows. We will also simplify and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> restructure the personal income tax system to encourage hard work and reward achievers, particularly for the middle income groups. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As 1995 was another successful year, the Government will continue to implement special schemes to return part of Government's surpluses to Singaporeans who fall outside the income tax net. This will be done in ways which enhance the assets of our citizens and do not create dependency expectations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal first with the tax changes for companies. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR COMPANIES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Corporate Income Tax</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate income tax was last reduced to 27% in 1994. As a further step towards the medium term target of 25%, the corporate tax rate will be reduced by 1 percentage point, from 27 to 26%, with effect from Year of Assessment 1997. This will help maintain our attractiveness to foreign investors and at the same time lighten the burden on local industries. Revenue loss is estimated to be $200 million annually. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Development and Expansion Incentive</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used tax incentives ever since Independence to promote economic development. The pioneer and post-pioneer incentives have played a major role in attracting high value-added investments to Singapore. There are however no appropriate incentives today for companies which either do not qualify for pioneer status or whose post-pioneer status has expired. To encourage companies which engage in high value-added activities to operate in Singapore and continue to invest in high technology projects and the major upgrading of equipment and operations, I intend to introduce a new incentive which will replace the post-pioneer incentive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this new incentive, which will be known as the Development and Expansion Incentive, income from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> qualifying activities will be taxed at a concessionary rate of not less than 10%. The incentive is intended for companies which engage in new projects and expansion or upgrading of their operations. For a company awarded this incentive, the initial period of the incentive will not exceed 10 years. Extensions of the incentive after the initial period may be granted. Each extension will not exceed a period of 5 years and the total period for this incentive will not exceed 20 years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Development and Expansion Incentive will apply to qualifying income derived from any period beginning in or after 1996. When this incentive comes into operation, it will replace the post-pioneer incentive. Further details of this incentive will be announced shortly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Investment Allowance Incentive (IA) for Water Recycling Plant</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present investment allowance incentive, the investment allowance granted to a company on the capital expenditure incurred for an approved project can only be set-off against the chargeable income from that project. Consequently, companies which carry on projects or activities where the income is already granted exemption from tax are not granted the investment allowance incentive. This is because there is no benefit from setting-off such allowances against exempt income. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with the national thrust to encourage water conservation, companies in water-intensive industries have been asked to reduce their water consumption through the installation of efficient water recycling plants. The high capital expenditure on such plants can qualify for investment allowances. However, companies in water-intensive industries may already have been awarded tax exemption or other incentives. I have therefore decided to allow the investment allowances which are granted to such companies for water-recycling plants to be set-off against chargeable income taxed at the normal rate, provided they satisfy \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> certain water conservation levels. This will apply to investment allowance granted for qualifying water-recycling plants incurred on or after 1st January 1996. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Tax Deduction for General Provisions of Finance Companies</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance companies have grown over the years. Their loans and deposits now account for 13.5% and 12.4% of total domestic loans and deposits. It is therefore crucial for finance companies to build up adequate provisions to cushion against unexpected losses and diminution in the value of their assets. This will enhance the overall soundness and stability of our financial system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage finance companies to build up their reserves, I have decided that with effect from Year of Assessment 1997, finance companies will be able to claim tax deduction for general provisions made for loans and investment in securities. This tax concession has been available to banks since Year of Assessment 1992. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax concession will be available only to finance companies which meet the statutory minimum capital funds requirement of $50 million and minimum capital adequacy ratio of 12% as prescribed under the Finance Companies (Amendment) Act. This is to ensure that only those finance companies whose shareholders have demonstrated their commitment to strengthen the companies_ capital will be allowed the incentive to further build up their general provisions. At present, 11 of the 22 finance companies are able to meet such capital requirements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As in the case of banks, the total amount of general provisions eligible for tax deduction will be limited to 2% of each finance company_s prescribed loans and investments. The amount deductible each year will be limited to 1/2% of such loans and investments or 25% of each finance company_s qualifying profit, whichever is the lower. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 795</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>First Year Depreciation for Highly Efficient Pollution Control and Energy-Efficient Equipment</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore continues to develop, increasing amounts of emissions will be released into the environment from more factories and motor vehicles. The demand for energy is also expected to increase significantly, bringing with it the potential for more pollution. The need to conserve energy and protect the environment cannot be over-emphasised. To achieve the objective of energy conservation and improving the quality of our air and water, industries are encouraged to install highly efficient pollution control devices and use highly energy-efficient equipment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all enterprises are allowed to write-off their plant and equipment for tax purposes over three years. To encourage the use of highly efficient pollution control and energy-efficient equipment, I have decided to allow all expenditure on such equipment incurred with effect from 1st January 1996 to enjoy 100% depreciation in the first year. This means that the qualifying expenditure on such equipment can be written off completely against the taxable income of the enterprise in the year following the year of purchase. If the enterprise does not have sufficient profits to take full advantage of the 100% depreciation allowance, the balance will be available for deduction in subsequent years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all enterprises in Singapore will take advantage of this concession to install highly efficient pollution control and energy conservation equipment as soon as possible. The scheme will be administered by the Ministry of The Environment. Details of the guidelines and qualifying criteria for these incentives are set out in Annexes (Cols. 809 - 820) I and II. \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1996/19960228/19960228-HA-0650809.htm\">Annexes - ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE TO APPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ALLOWANCE TO APPROVED HIGHLY EFFICIENT POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, QUALIFYING CRITERIA FOR HIGHLY EFFICIENT AIR POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT, QUALIFYING CRITERIA FOR HIGHLY EFFICIENT WATER POLLUTION CONTROL EQUIPMENT (Cols. 809 - 820)</a>\n  <br> Reduction of Withholding Tax Rates \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, payments of royalty and interest (other than interest on bank deposits and inter-bank transactions) to non-residents are subject to tax at 27% of the gross amount payable less allowable expenses. In practice, as the law requires \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 796</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> withholding of tax on such payments to non-residents at 27% of the gross amount, and the recipients either cannot or do not claim the expenses, the tax is effectively 27% of the gross amount. Unless reduced under a double taxation agreement, this tax rate of 27% is high in comparison with the rates of other countries in this region. This high level of tax discourages the development of activities which require high input of technology or funding from overseas. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the development of Singapore as a knowledge centre and a node for technology transfer, I have decided to reduce the rate of tax on royalty and rent for movable properties payable to non-residents to 15% of the gross amount with immediate effect. This will benefit creative services as well as knowledge and technology intensive activities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, I have also decided to reduce the rate of tax on interest payments to non-residents to 15% of the gross amount with immediate effect. This will make it more flexible for Singapore companies to diversify their borrowing sources to include financial institutions overseas, particularly in the financing of operations outside Singapore. It will further facilitate our regionalisation efforts as business enterprises which need to borrow offshore for venturing overseas or expanding their overseas operations will benefit from lower borrowing costs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rate of tax on such payments reduced to 15% of the gross amount, the rate for withholding of tax on these payments will be similarly reduced. This reduced rate of tax will, however, not apply to interest, royalty and rent for movable properties derived by non-residents through their operations carried out in or from Singapore. Such interest, royalty and rent will continue to be taxed on the net amount at the normal corporate income tax rate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this reduction in the rate of tax on interest and royalty payments to non-residents, full or partial exemption on such payments will \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 797</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> continue to be granted selectively under the various incentive schemes for projects which contribute significantly to the economic and technological development of Singapore. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>TAX CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Personal Income Tax</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the good performance of the economy in 1995, an across-the-board one-off tax rebate of 10% on individual income tax will be granted in Year of Assessment 1996. Revenue loss to the Government is estimated at $250 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 14 tax brackets in the present personal income tax schedule. To simplify the tax system, I propose to reduce the number of brackets from 14 to 10. At the same time, to further encourage hard work and to reward talent and enterprise, the top marginal income tax rate will be lowered from 30% to 28%, with appropriate reductions in the other rates. The new brackets and rates are shown at Annex III. (Cols. 821 - 822) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1996/19960228/19960228-HA-0650821.htm\">Annex III - REDUCTION IN PERSONAL INCOME TAX RATES WITH EFFECT FROM YEAR OF ASSESSMENT 1997 (Cols. 821 - 822)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new structure of tax brackets has been designed especially to lighten the tax burden of the middle income group, with chargeable incomes between $25,000 and $100,000. Many such families pay substantial amounts of car-related taxes or foreign workers levy, if they own a car or employ a maid. The changes will take effect from Year of Assessment 1997. Revenue loss is estimated to be $375 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Tax Relief for National Servicemen</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our NSmen play a crucial role in guaranteeing the security and prosperity of Singapore. In Year of Assessment 1993, the Government introduced tax reliefs for NSmen of $1,000 for active NSmen and $500 for other NSmen in order to recognise their special contributions. However, the value of these reliefs have been eroded by subsequent reductions in personal income tax rates. The Government has reviewed the amount of these reliefs and decided: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The relief for active NSmen will be doubled from $1,000 to $2,000. Active NSmen are those who are called up annually for in-camp training and other activities to maintain their operational efficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The relief for all who have done their full time national service but are not now in the active national service will also be doubled from $500 to $1,000. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government also recognises the contribution of parents and wives of NSmen to Total Defence. The parents are the ones who brought up the NSmen. The wives have to share the burden of looking after the family when the NSmen are called up for in-camp training. The Government has therefore decided to extend the tax relief scheme for NSmen to the parents and wives of NSmen who are themselves Singapore citizens. Each parent will receive a tax relief of $500, regardless of the number of children who have undergone national service. Wives of NSmen will also each receive a tax relief of $500. The $500 relief is half the amount for NSmen who are not now in active national service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax reliefs will apply to NSmen and the parents and wives of NSmen who have served in the SAF and also in other services, like the Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force. These reliefs will take effect from Year of Assessment 1997. The estimated revenue loss is $16 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Rebates on HDB Service and Conservancy and Rental Charges</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many lower income Singaporeans do not pay personal income tax. To ensure that they too benefit from our economic success, the rebates granted last year on HDB Service and Conservancy (S&amp;C) charges and rentals to citizen householders staying in rented and owner-occupied HDB flats will be extended for another year, with some modifications. The rebates will be as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) \n  <i>One-Room Flats.</i> Three months' net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental and S&amp;C rebates will be made on 1st July, 1st September and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) \n  <i>Two-Room Flats.</i> Two months_ net rent and three months' net S&amp;C charges, after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rental rebates will be made on 1st July and 1st December, and the S&amp;C rebates on 1st July, 1st September and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) \n  <i>Three-Room Flats.</i> Three months' net S&amp;C charges after deduction of the GST offset rebates. The rebates will take effect on 1st July, 1st September and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) \n  <i>Four-Room Flats.</i> Two months_ gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st July and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) \n  <i>Five-Room Flats.</i> Two months_ gross S&amp;C charges, to be made on 1st July and 1st December this year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated cost of these rental and S&amp;C rebates is $53 \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Rebates on Public Utilities Bill</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further assist lower income households, the Government will grant a rebate on the public utilities bills of citizen households living in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5-room HDB flats (whether rented or owner-occupied). The amount will be $150 for 1 and 2-room HDB flats, $120 for 3-room HDB flats and $100 for 4 and 5-room HDB flats. Payment of the rebate will be made in the second half of this year. Details will be announced in due course. This is expected to cost the Government $73 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the economy continues to do well, I will consider granting similar rebates on public utilities bills for lower income households in 1997 and 1998. This rebate will far exceed the likely increase in annual public utilities bills for these households arising from revisions of electricity tariffs for several years. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>CPF Medisave Top-Up Scheme</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical costs are matters which concern every Singaporean, especially older citizens. Medisave, Medishield and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Medifund have provided for the medical needs for nearly all citizens. Nevertheless, many still worry whether they have provided enough for themselves and their families. This worry is really not justified. But as a gesture to reassure Singaporeans and to emphasise the key role of Medisave in providing for the medical needs of citizens, the Government will pay $200 into the Medisave account of every Singapore citizen aged 21 and above. The payment will be made on 1st October 1996. This is expected to cost the Government $390 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister announced last year a Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme in three instalments, to help older Singaporeans who retired before or soon after the onset of Medisave to build up their Medisave accounts. The first instalment was paid in January 1996. The Prime Minister has said that the second instalment due in January 1997, and the third instalment due in January 1998, would depend on the state of the economy. As the economy has done well, I am happy to confirm that the Government will pay the second instalment of the Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme in January 1997 as scheduled. The top-up grant will be paid into the CPF Medisave accounts of eligible Singaporeans who are 62 years or older on 1st April 1996. As with the first instalment, eligible recipients will have to make a co-payment of $50 between 1st July 1996 and 31st December 1996 into their CPF Medisave Account. The Government will match this $50 with a contribution of $100 to $350 depending on the age group. 300,000 senior citizens qualify for the scheme and the total cost of this, if fully taken up, is $85 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government has reviewed the Pre-Medisave Top-Up Scheme, and decided to enhance it by adding one more instalment, increasing the package from three to four instalments. The fourth instalment will be paid in January 1999. The eligibility criteria and the co-payment requirements are the same as for the earlier instalments. The fourth instalment will also be subject to the state of the economy then. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>CPF Share Ownership Top-Up Scheme (SOTUS)</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Singaporeans build up sufficient CPF savings to buy shares in Singapore Telecom and other Government owned companies and statutory boards which will be privatised from time to time, the Government implemented two SOTUS exercises in 1993 and 1995. This year, the Government will implement a third SOTUS scheme to top-up CPF accounts of citizens aged 21 and above. Special recognition will be given to national servicemen, as recommended by the RECORD II Committee. The Government will therefore make contributions to CPF accounts as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$300 to all Singapore citizens \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$400 to citizens who have performed NS \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$500 to citizens on active NS. To qualify, CPF members must credit at least $500 into their accounts during the 12-month period from 1st March 1996 to 28th February 1997. The Government will pay in its contributions on 28th February 1997. Members who contribute less than $500 will receive a pro-rated contribution from the Government. This is expected to cost the Government $480 million. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Second Offering of Singapore Telecom Shares</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to build a share owning society, the Government will from time to time offer Singaporeans stocks of blue-chip Singapore companies at a discount. This will give Singaporeans a more direct stake in the growth and prosperity of Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first offering of ST shares to Singaporeans in November 1993 was a resounding success. The Group A share scheme increased the number of Singaporeans owning shares from 250,000 to 1.4 million. The scheme has also succeeded in getting Singaporeans to hold on to the shares as long term investments, instead of stagging them for a quick profit. 95% of Group A ST shareholders still own their ST shares. Those who bought 600 Group A ST shares in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 802</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> November 1993 for $1.90 each and have kept them now have 720 ST shares, worth about $3.50 each. Their initial investment of $1,140 is now worth $2,520 - more than double in less than three years. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has decided to make a second offering of Singapore Telecom shares to Singaporeans. The offering will be packaged like the Group A scheme in the initial ST flotation. The shares will be offered at a discount to the market price to CPF members. They will come with a loyalty bonus package to encourage Singaporeans to hold on to the shares as a long-term investment. This is expected to take place in the second half of 1996. The details are being worked out and will be announced at a later date. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Income Tax on Net Annual Values of Residential Properties</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, the Net Annual Value (NAV) of a property used for residential purposes is deemed to be profits arising from property and is liable for individual income tax unless specifically exempted. Currently, for owner-occupied property, the first $75,000 of its NAV is exempted from tax. To allow for increases in the values of residential properties, the exemption limit will be increased to $150,000. This will take effect from Year of Assessment 1997. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Estate Duty</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, estate duty is structured in two tiers: the first $10 million value of estate chargeable to duty is taxed at 5% and all subsequent amounts at 10%. Exemption is given to the first $3 million of all residential properties and the first $500,000 of all movable assets, including CPF balances. CPF balances in excess of $500,000 are also exempt. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow for the effects of inflation and rising asset prices over the years, the Government has decided that the $10 million threshold below which the first tier rate of 5% will apply will be raised to $12 million. The exemption limits for residential properties and movable assets, including CPF balances, will also be raised to $9 million and $600,000 respectively. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 803</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> CPF balances in excess of $600,000 will continue to be exempt. This tax change will take immediate effect. \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>OTHER TAX CHANGES</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Reduction in Property Tax</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property tax rate for industrial, commercial and let out residential properties was reduced from 15% to 13% last year. Nonetheless, our property tax rate is still higher than some neighbouring countries. This is exacerbated by our relatively high property values. I announced in previous Budgets that the property tax rate would be lowered to 12% over 4-5 years. To help reduce business costs and further enhance Singapore_s competitiveness, I have decided to expedite the reduction of property tax rate. With effect from 1st July 1996, the property tax rate will be reduced by 1% from 13% to 12%. The revenue loss is estimated at $118 million. The Government strongly urges landlords to pass on the savings in property tax to their tenants. JTC, HDB and other statutory boards will pass on the tax savings in full to their tenants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4% concessionary tax rate for owner-occupied residential properties will remain unchanged. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Stamp Duty on Property Transfer</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stamp duty on property transfers in Singapore is currently levied at the rate of 1% for the first $90,000, 2% for the next $60,000 and 3% thereafter on the value of the property. To keep pace with property price increases, I have decided to adjust the threshold values for stamp duty on property transfers to: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 1% for the first $180,000; \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) 2% for the next $180,000; and \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) 3% thereafter on the value of the property. This will take immediate effect. The estimated revenue loss for the Government from such an adjustment is estimated at $245 million a year. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 804</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Stamp Duty on Leases</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the stamp duty rates on property leases range from 0.8% for those with a lease period of less than 1 year, to 3.2% for those with a lease period of more than 3 years. To reduce business costs, I have decided to halve the stamp duty on leases with immediate effect. This is expected to reduce stamp duty revenue by $161 million a year. Details are given in Annex IV. (Cols. 823 - 824) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1996/19960228/19960228-HA-0650823.htm\">Annex IV - STAMP DUTY RATES ON LEASES (Cols. 823 - 824)</a>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <b>Rationalisation of Instruments Subject to Stamp Duty</b> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, stamp duty is levied on a variety of instruments specified in the First Schedule to the Stamp Duties Act. The last major review of stamp duties was undertaken in 1980 at which time the number of articles in the First Schedule was reduced from 68 to 47. To further reduce costs and inconvenience to businesses and members of the public, I have decided that the stamp duty on a further 13 types of instruments will be abolished. The rates of the stamp duties that are retained will be streamlined. This will take immediate effect. The estimated revenue loss for these changes is $6 million. Details are set forth in Annex V. (Cols. 825 - 830) \n  <br>\n  <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1996/19960228/19960228-HA-0650825.htm\">Annex V - STAMP DUTIES TO BE ABOLISHED, STAMP DUTIES RETAINED (Cols. 825 - 830)</a>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>CONCLUSION</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has come a long way. More opportunities and challenges lie ahead. To meet the challenges, we must upgrade our skills, technical know-how and the strength of our companies. To do this, we must continue to maintain a conducive fiscal environment for businesses to innovate and thrive. Our tax regime must support the next phase of economic development. In particular, as we gear towards knowledge based activities, attracting and retaining talent will be instrumental in sustaining our economic prosperity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian and regional economies are growing strongly. We in Singapore can sustain high growth by engaging our \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> economy with the region. In the coming years, international competition will become more intense. Uncertainties will abound. We must be nimble and responsive to external changes while pursuing steadfastly our long term goals and aspirations. If we persevere in upgrading our human resource and domestic technical capabilities and at the same time capitalize on the opportunities abroad, I am confident we will continue to progress and excel in the future.
