Firstly,  in  order  to  create\r\n\r\nemployment  for our people, we have already  embarked\r\n\r\nupon our industrialisation programme. As a result  of\r\n\r\nthis,  we  have selected Jurong as the  site  for  an\r\n\r\nindustrial estate which is in my constituency. In the\r\n\r\nprocess,  some  rural folk have to be  resettled  and\r\n\r\nproblems usually arise in relation to resettlement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, generally speaking, the rural people do not\r\n\r\nquarrel  with  our industrial development  programme.\r\n\r\nThey  are quite prepared to make some sacrifices  and\r\n\r\nmove to the resettlement areas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nprovided, of course, that they are given adequate and\r\n\r\nreasonable  compensation. The resettlement  problems,\r\n\r\nhowever,  are usually complicated by some  Government\r\n\r\nofficials  who  mishandle the situation.  I  wish  to\r\n\r\nquote one instance. In my constituency, there is  one\r\n\r\nisland  known as Pulau Ayer Chawan which, as  Members\r\n\r\nare aware, has been chosen as the investment site  of\r\n\r\nEsso  (Singapore) Limited who will establish  a  $200\r\n\r\nmillion refinery there. The people living there  will\r\n\r\nhave  to  be resettled on other islands. But for  one\r\n\r\nreason  or  other,  the  Commissioner  of  Lands  has\r\n\r\nallowed  one  family to move to an  island  known  as\r\n\r\nPulau Ayer Merbau. As a result, the other families on\r\n\r\nPulau Ayer Chawan have also asked to be resettled  on\r\n\r\nthe  same  island, but their applications  have  been\r\n\r\nrejected  because the island has been  earmarked  for\r\n\r\nfurther industrial development\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they are dissatisfied; they think it is not fair.\r\n\r\nThere are now seven families still staying in\r\n\r\nPulau  Ayer  Chawan. Is this not  a  case  where  our\r\n\r\nindustrial  development is being hampered because  of\r\n\r\nmishandling  by  Land  Office  officials'?  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  there is any inter-departmental liaison,  in\r\n\r\nmy opinion, the Commissioner of Lands should at least\r\n\r\nget  in  touch  with  the Director  of  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board to ensure that the island  which  I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned  will  not  be  used  for  industrial\r\n\r\ndevelopment  before  he  allows  any  family  to   be\r\n\r\nresettled there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Government officials do not collect\r\n\r\nrevenue on due date and allow arrears to\r\n\r\naccumulate. This gives rise to inconvenience  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  and probably a loss of revenue to Government.\r\n\r\nI  have  noticed with growing concern that there  are\r\n\r\nmore and more cases of arrears in revenue collection.\r\n\r\nThis  happens not only in the Property Tax Department\r\n\r\nbut also in the Land Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, there are about 50 sand-quarry\r\n\r\noperators  in  Singapore and, under the  regulations,\r\n\r\nthey  are  required  -to pay a royalty  to  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice.  I  do  not know whether it  is  due  to  the\r\n\r\noversight  of the Commissioner of Lands or  for  some\r\n\r\nother   reasons  that  this  royalty  has  not   been\r\n\r\ncollected  for  the  past  few  years.  But  somebody\r\n\r\nrecently   discovered   this  and   the   sand-quarry\r\n\r\noperators  were asked to pay the arrears  in  royalty\r\n\r\namounting to about $500,000 for five years. It is not\r\n\r\nreasonable to expect them to pay this amount  in  one\r\n\r\nlump  sum. In fact, many of them were unable  to  pay\r\n\r\nsuch  a huge sum of money and some of them have  even\r\n\r\nstopped operation. I do not know whether it is  still\r\n\r\npossible  to recover the arrears from those who  have\r\n\r\nceased operation. I wish to ask the Minister why such\r\n\r\narrears have been allowed to accumulate. Is it due to\r\n\r\nthe negligence of the officials concerned?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, in my constituency, many areas have been\r\n\r\nearmarked    for    industrial    development,    and\r\n\r\nconstruction  of public works is going  on,  such  as\r\n\r\nrepair  of soads, construction of bridges and so  on.\r\n\r\nThere  are usually some difficulties in the  approval\r\n\r\nof  these  works. One of these relates to  the  undue\r\n\r\ndelays  by  the  Land  Office  in  the  clearance  of\r\n\r\napplications  for certain projects. Sir,  I  wish  to\r\n\r\namplify  on this point. It will be a waste of  public\r\n\r\nmoney for people to develop areas which are earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  development. Some people from development  areas\r\n\r\nhave recently been resettled in my constituency,  and\r\n\r\nit  is  unreasonable for the authorities to  resettle\r\n\r\nthem  once more in another area in such a short time,\r\n\r\nbecause  the  areas in which they live  now  will  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped.  So  there is actually no reason  for  the\r\n\r\ndelay  mentioned  above.  In fact,  applications  for\r\n\r\nclearance  of construction projects will be  answered\r\n\r\nonly after a period of six months or one year. I  had\r\n\r\non the same occasion here last year complained of the\r\n\r\ninefficiency  of the Land Office and I am  mentioning\r\n\r\nit  again  in  order to catch the  attention  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I wish to draw the Minister's attention\r\n\r\nto some of the complaints made against the Land\r\n\r\nOffice. In my constituency, there was an instance\r\n\r\nwhich gave rise to-unnecessary inconvenience to the\r\n\r\npeople due to the inefficiency of the Land Office. At\r\n\r\nthe 15th milestone of my constituency there is a\r\n\r\nvillage which has about 100 families. One of them\r\n\r\napplied for permission to renovate his-shop, but his\r\n\r\napplication was rejected because that area has been\r\n\r\nearmarked for agricultural development. I have\r\n\r\nalready mentioned that my constituency is in the\r\n\r\nrural area. I fail to understand why the Land Office\r\n\r\nhas classified this area as a development area. I\r\n\r\nthink the officers must be blind to realities. As a\r\n\r\nresult, unnecessary trouble has been created and the\r\n\r\nofficers concerned should be held responsible. In\r\n\r\nfact, in the surrounding areas, permission has been\r\n\r\ngranted for the rural folk to build their huts and\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister give appropriate-instructions to\r\n\r\nhis  officers to look further into the matler so that\r\n\r\nthe   rural   folk  will  be  given   the   necessary\r\n\r\nfacilities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (Law Division) (Mr S. Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me-first deal\r\n\r\nwith   the   queries  raised  by   the   Member   for\r\n\r\nMountbatten. The United Kingdom Services occupy about\r\n\r\n14,603  acres of land in Singapore. A total of  1,177\r\n\r\nacres of defence land have so far been transferred to\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Government.  The  rest  of  the  land\r\n\r\noccupied  by  the  Services will be returned  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government at the end of 1971.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong complained of the\r\n\r\ndiscrimination  in  resettling, families  who   were\r\n\r\nliving  in Pulau Ayer Chawan. I would like to  assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  there was no discrimination in  resettling\r\n\r\nthese  families. One isolated case was a resident  of\r\n\r\nPulau  Ayer Chawan who was allocated a site in  Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer Merbau. The decision was\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken on or before the whole of Pulau Ayer Chawan was\r\n\r\nconsidered to be cleared for industrial development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other families total nine in number. When it was\r\n\r\ndecided  that Pulau Ayer Chawan was to be  leased  to\r\n\r\nEsso  (Singapore) Limited, the Land Office offered  a\r\n\r\npiece of land to the remaining nine families in Pulau\r\n\r\nMerlimau  which  has  already  been  laid  out  as  a\r\n\r\nresettlement area by the Economic Development  Board.\r\n\r\nOf  these  nine families, four of them have  accepted\r\n\r\nthis  offer and the other five families have  erected\r\n\r\nhouses on the foreshore of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to royalties paid by the sand-quarry\r\n\r\noperators, the question of arrears is a long-standing\r\n\r\nproblem  with the Land Office. It appears  that  this\r\n\r\nhas  not  been  successfully resolved. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  investigating the  circumstances  under\r\n\r\nwhich  these arrears have been allowed to accumulate.\r\n\r\nThe collection of royalties in respect of the current\r\n\r\nyear has been very- satisfactory and it is hoped that\r\n\r\nsome  reasonable arrangements can he  worked  out  to\r\n\r\ncollect  the  arrears of royalty  due  to  the  state\r\n\r\nwithout causing undue hardship to the operators.  The\r\n\r\nLand  Office,  in consultation with the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance,  will be prepared to consider any reasonable\r\n\r\narrangement  to settle the outstanding arrears  in  a\r\n\r\nmanner which will not cause any undue hardship to the\r\n\r\noperators or landowners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong raised the question of repair\r\n\r\nof roads and so on. This is not the responsibility of\r\n\r\nthe  Land Office, if the Member is complaining of the\r\n\r\ndelay in approving applications for erection of  huts\r\n\r\nor repair of houses, then certain formalities have to\r\n\r\nhe   complied   with,  and  in   most   cases   these\r\n\r\napplications  have been approved by the  Land  Office\r\n\r\nwithin   a  period  of  four  to  six  weeks.   These\r\n\r\napplications have also to go through the Chief  Build\r\n\r\ning~  Surveyor's Office and this will take a  further\r\n\r\nsix to eight weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complains of the refusal of\r\n\r\npermission to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrenovate  a  shop  at  the 15th milestone  Sembawang.\r\n\r\nFirst  of  all, if the shop is on private  land,  the\r\n\r\nLand Office does not come into the picture at all.

But the area he  is\r\n\r\ntalking  about  is  actually zoned  for  agricultural\r\n\r\npurposes and the applications should be refused.  But\r\n\r\nthere  has  been no application and it has  not  been\r\n\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, 1\r\n\r\nam  not satisfied with the reply of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary because he has not answered to the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point is this. Why did the Commissioner of\r\n\r\nLands  fail  to consult or liaise with  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  before he  allotted  resettlement\r\n\r\nland  to  the  people? He allotted various  areas  to\r\n\r\npeople  at his whim and fancy, an-d later on when  he\r\n\r\ndiscovered  to his surprise that the areas  were  ear\r\n\r\nmarked  for  development, he had to refuse subsequent\r\n\r\napplications  for  these areas. So  the  people  feel\r\n\r\nthere  is injustice and indiscrimination. As a result\r\n\r\nof  his  mishandling the situation,  our  development\r\n\r\nprogramme has been delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why should the collection of royalties or\r\n\r\nrevenue  fall  into  arrears?  Is  it  due   to   the\r\n\r\nnegligence or oversight of the officers? The name  of\r\n\r\nevery operator of sand quarries is listed in the Land\r\n\r\nOffice  and he is required to pay royalties annually.\r\n\r\nSo  the collection of royalties should not have  been\r\n\r\nleft in arrears for five years. Can the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary be certain that he will be able to  collect\r\n\r\nthe arrears in full'? If not, there will be a loss in\r\n\r\nour revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point relates to road repairs and road\r\n\r\nconstruction.  It has nothing to do with  repairs  to\r\n\r\nhouses.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not answered\r\n\r\nmy point. My complaint is this. Applications for road\r\n\r\nrepairs  and for the construction of bridges have  to\r\n\r\nbe  cleared with the Land Office, because  the  areas\r\n\r\nare   earmarked  for  development,  before  they  are\r\n\r\nreferred  to  the Urban and Rural Services  Committee\r\n\r\nfor  consideration. It happens that the Land Office\r\n\r\ntakes  a  lot of time to reply. The roads  are  in  a\r\n\r\nstate  of disrepair and they become worse because  of\r\n\r\nthe undue delay. As a result, more repairs have to be\r\n\r\ncarried  out and this means more expenditure  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> In the resettlement of one family\r\n\r\nfrom  Pulau  Ayer  Chawan to Pulau Merbau  and  other\r\n\r\nfamilies  to  Pulau  Merlimau,  there  has  been   no\r\n\r\nnegligence on the part of the Commissioner  of  Lands\r\n\r\nand  there has been proper liaison between  the  Land\r\n\r\nOffice  and  the Economic Development Board.  I  will\r\n\r\ngive  the  full details of this case, and I hope  the\r\n\r\nMember will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1967, an application was received by the\r\n\r\nLand-  Office from one islander who had been residing\r\n\r\nin Pulau Ayer Chawan for seven years. The application\r\n\r\nwas  in  the  nature of regularising his unauthorised\r\n\r\noccupation  of a hut on the island. The  Licence  Com\r\n\r\nmittee approved the application on 3rd August,  1967,\r\n\r\nand a proper house site was allocated to him on Pulau\r\n\r\nAver Chawan. All this happened before this island was\r\n\r\nconsidered for an oil refinery site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this was going on, investigations had\r\n\r\ncommenced to establish the suitability of Pulau  Ayer\r\n\r\nChawan  as  an  oil refinery site. As there  was  the\r\n\r\npossibility  at  that time that the island  would  be\r\n\r\ntaken   over   for   industrial   development,    the\r\n\r\nCommissioner of Lands decided to freeze the  position\r\n\r\non  the island regarding the issue of a new Temporary\r\n\r\nOccupation Licence to this particular person who  had\r\n\r\nalready been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallocated  a  site.  Therefore,  this  applicant  was\r\n\r\nreallocated  a  site in Pulau Ayer Merbau.  By  March\r\n\r\n1968,  the suitability of the island - that is  Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer   Chawan   -  as  an  oil  refinery   site   was\r\n\r\nestablished. Therefore, it was necessary to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  resettlement of all the nine families living  in\r\n\r\nPulau Ayer Chawan. It was decided to resettle them in\r\n\r\nPulau Merlimau which had already been laid out  as  a\r\n\r\nresettlement  area by the Economic Development  Board\r\n\r\nwhen  it had to clear the land in Jurong. As  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier,  the  nine families  were  accordingly\r\n\r\noffered   houses  already  built  by   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board on the island. Four of  these  fami\r\n\r\nlies   have  already  accepted  and  the  other  five\r\n\r\nfamilies have elected to have house sites only on the\r\n\r\nforeshores of the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the sand quarries, here again, I\r\n\r\nhave  to take up the time of the House to relate  the\r\n\r\nhistory of the arrears of royalties.

Of course, the Government or the Land Office\r\n\r\nwill  do  all it can to collect the arrears.  At  the\r\n\r\nsame  time,  as the Member has complained that  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  hard-ship  to  the operators  of  the  sand\r\n\r\nquarries,  we  are prepared to come to some  kind  of\r\n\r\narrangement to collect these arrears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go into the details of the sand quarries. The\r\n\r\nSand Quarries Ordinance, 1961, came into operation on\r\n\r\nthe  5th  of December, 1962. This Ordinance  requires\r\n\r\nall  operators  to  be licensed by the  Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment. There had been indiscriminate removal  of\r\n\r\nsand with harmful effects on adjoining dwellers, such\r\n\r\nas   the  drying  up  of  wells,  mosquito  breeding,\r\n\r\nblockage  and  siltage of drains, etc. The  Ordinance\r\n\r\nwas  designed to ensure adequate control  over  sandquarry operations. Briefly, it appears that following\r\n\r\nthe  licensing of sandquarry operators under the Sand\r\n\r\nQuarries  Ordinance, 1961, the Land Office called  on\r\n\r\nthese operators to furnish returns on the quantum  of\r\n\r\nsand  removal.  In 1964, all licensed operators  were\r\n\r\nasked by the Land Office to declare their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngross  produce figures to enable an assessment to  be\r\n\r\nmade on the royalty to be charged. The response  was\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory.  Many sand-quarry operators  did  not\r\n\r\nsupply  this information and some forms were returned\r\n\r\nundelivered. Meanwhile, field inspections  were  made\r\n\r\nand  consultations  were conducted  with  the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department  on  the method  and  procedure  of\r\n\r\nassessing the produce of the various quarries and the\r\n\r\nquantum  to  be  charged for royalty.  Unfortunately,\r\n\r\nthis was not followed up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> That is why an investigation is going\r\n\r\non  now. In 1966, some operators were again asked  to\r\n\r\ndeclare  their gross produce and others were required\r\n\r\nto  make  royalty  payments. Further  representations\r\n\r\nwere made that the produce figures quoted by the Land\r\n\r\nOffice  were excessive. Many of the operators claimed\r\n\r\nthat  the figures they themselves had quoted  to  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department at the time of applications\r\n\r\nfor licences had been deliberately over-estimated  in\r\n\r\norder  to  ensure that they got licences.  The  sand-\r\n\r\nquarry  operators have themselves to blame for  this,\r\n\r\nThey  seemed to be very unreasonable. It would appear\r\n\r\nthat  between 1964 and 1967, there was an ineffective\r\n\r\nfollow-up  on the part of the Land Office.  We  admit\r\n\r\nthis  in  the  matter  of collecting  royalties  and,\r\n\r\ncoupled  with  the negative response from  the  opera\r\n\r\ntors, this has led to an accumulation of the arrears.\r\n\r\nAction  has been taken by the Land Office  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the 1968 royalties are paid promptly.  The  res\r\n\r\nponse has been fairly satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has said that there are about 50 sand\r\n\r\nquarries.  There  are only 46 sand-quarry  operators.\r\n\r\nForty-two of the 46 operators licensed by the  Public\r\n\r\nWorks  Department have paid a total  of  $106,709  as\r\n\r\nroyalties  for  this  year.  Royalties  amounting  to\r\n\r\n$13,947 for this year are due from four operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong spoke on repairs of roads. The\r\n\r\nLand Office has nothing to do with this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): r Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI am not satisfied with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe reply of the Parliamentary Secretary.

The  first  question\r\n\r\nrelates to the allocation of land by the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Lands to those affected by resettlement to  Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer Merbau. Does the Commissioner of Lands know that\r\n\r\nthis island will be used for industrial purposes when\r\n\r\nhe  allocates  land to the affected family  in  Pulau\r\n\r\nAyer Chawan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that he said that the Land\r\n\r\nOffice has nothing to do with the repairing of roads.\r\n\r\nI  think  he has been sleeping. I have said just  now\r\n\r\nthat  part  of the land in my constituency  has  been\r\n\r\nearmarked   for  industrial  purposes.   Before   any\r\n\r\nrepairing of roads can be undertaken, clearance  must\r\n\r\nhe obtained from the Commissioner of Lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswam (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, can you be even briefer\r\n\r\nin your reply?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The Member for Sembawang asked me\r\n\r\nwhether I knew of any refusal of applications for the\r\n\r\nreconstruction  of  houses.  Yes,  there  have   been\r\n\r\ninvestigations.   There   have   been   only    three\r\n\r\napplications from house owners on state land for  the\r\n\r\nreconstruction or repair of their houses. Two of them\r\n\r\nhave  been  approved. One application  has  not  been\r\n\r\napproved because the applicant has not complied  with\r\n\r\ncertain requirements. If the Member for Sembawang was\r\n\r\nspeaking  about some other application, I  will  tell\r\n\r\nhim  that  the applicant did not have the landowner's\r\n\r\npermission   and   the   Chief  Building   Surveyor's\r\n\r\nDepartment might have refused to approve it.

I understand that our national policy is  to\r\n\r\nindustrialise speedily and only thus can  we  have  a\r\n\r\nfuture.  At the moment, there are still about  20,000\r\n\r\npeople   engaged  in  agriculture  in  our   country.\r\n\r\nAgricultural produce is worth about $200 million  per\r\n\r\nyear.  Of course, the actual figure will have  to  be\r\n\r\nestimated  by the Primary Production Department  when\r\n\r\nthey  have  gone through the farm licensing exercise.\r\n\r\nHowever,   agricultural  activity   should   not   be\r\n\r\nneglected in our economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that while we are industrialising, we\r\n\r\nshould  also pay careful attention to the development\r\n\r\nof agriculture. All along the Government has not been\r\n\r\npaying equal attention or given equal emphasis to the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of agriculture. There is a Primary Production  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment but it is always passive. It may  be\r\n\r\nof  benefit to large-scale farmers, but it is not  so\r\n\r\nto  small  farmers. The present farming  methods  are\r\n\r\nvery backward and the method of selling farm produce,\r\n\r\ntoo,  is  not  scientific. May I  ask  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nassistance  has  the  Primary  Production  Department\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  farmers in this respect?  At  present\r\n\r\nkelong fishing is in a retrogressive state. Fishermen\r\n\r\nget  very little fish from off-shore shallow  waters.\r\n\r\nMany farmers and fishermen have been forced to change\r\n\r\ntheir   means  of  livelihood  and  seek   employment\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  What kind of assistance has  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department given to them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite aware that because of the weather and the condition of the soil, we can only produce certain crops to supplement our food. As for staple items of food- like rice and wheat, we have to depend on imports. The supplementary foodstuffs we produce are vegetables, fruits an-d\r\n\r\ntobacco. Our livestock is poultry, pigs, cows,  goats\r\n\r\nand  other  farm animals. These are what  the  people\r\n\r\nneed  for  their  food. As I have pointed  out,  this\r\n\r\nagricultural produce is worth $200 million per  year.\r\n\r\nIf  our agricultural production is in a retrogressive\r\n\r\nstate,  not  only will we have to import  our  staple\r\n\r\nfood,   but   we   may  even  have  to   import   our\r\n\r\nsupplementary food. Every year there will be  a  loss\r\n\r\nof  $200 million. If there is a change for the  worse\r\n\r\nin  our  situation, we may not even have  tapioca  to\r\n\r\neat.  There are 20,000 people engaged in agriculture.\r\n\r\nHow can our industry absorb all of them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel there is a retrogression in agriculture.\r\n\r\nThere are two signs to show this. First, our land  is\r\n\r\nlimited  and  land for agriculture is  also  limited.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 1967 statistics, the acreage of land\r\n\r\ntaken  up  by  the  planting of  fruits,  vegetables,\r\n\r\npotatoes  and tobacco is only 12,240 acres.  This  is\r\n\r\nabout  19  square  miles. The land  used  for  animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry  is slightly less. There are no  statistics\r\n\r\non  this.  But, generally speaking, land  for  animal\r\n\r\nhusbandry  should be about six square miles.  We  can\r\n\r\nsee  from these figures that the total land taken  up\r\n\r\nfor agriculture and animal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhusbandry  is  about 25 square miles. More  and  more\r\n\r\nland is being acquired for industrialisation and  for\r\n\r\nmilitary  purposes.  There is also  the  question  of\r\n\r\nurbanisation.  There will then be  very  little  land\r\n\r\nleft  for  agriculture. Even the land  allocated  for\r\n\r\neach  resettled farmer cannot be more than two acres.\r\n\r\nAs  far  as I know, most of the farmers are allocated\r\n\r\nabout  one  acre  of  land each. The  land  area  for\r\n\r\nagriculture is, therefore, decreasing day after  day.\r\n\r\nConsequently, agricultural produce will also decrease\r\n\r\nin quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, because of the backwardness of their\r\n\r\nagricultural  production and the unscientific  method\r\n\r\nof  selling  their produce, many farmers  who  depend\r\n\r\nsolely on farming as their livelihood are living at a\r\n\r\nsubsistence level. Many of their children go  out  to\r\n\r\nseek other employment. For instance, many of them  in\r\n\r\nmy constituency have gone to work in the factories in\r\n\r\norder to get additional income for their families. It\r\n\r\ntakes almost the whole day, from four or five o'clock\r\n\r\nin the morning until seven or eight o'clock at night,\r\n\r\nfor  one  to engage in agricultural activity.  Modern\r\n\r\nyouths  find  that they can get a better income  from\r\n\r\nother  jobs than farming. They have, therefore, given\r\n\r\nit up. Consequently, there are fewer and fewer people\r\n\r\nengaged   in   agriculture.  All   this   shows   the\r\n\r\nretrogressive  state  of  our  agriculture.  If  this\r\n\r\ncondition  continues,  then  I  dare  say  that   our\r\n\r\nagricultural production will deteriorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government is really sincere in wanting to\r\n\r\nassist the development of agriculture, then it should\r\n\r\ntake  measures  to  stop the drift into  agricultural\r\n\r\nretrogression.  The  least  the  Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment can do Is to help the farmers to modernise\r\n\r\ntheir  agricultural production and introduce  a  more\r\n\r\nscientific method of selling their produce.  This  is\r\n\r\nvery  necessary In the light of our local conditions,\r\n\r\nand  is the only way to get the best returns from our\r\n\r\nlimited land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given great assistance in\r\n\r\nindustrialisation,  for instance,  by  setting  up  a\r\n\r\nDevelopment Bank. The Government can also set\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup a financial organisation to assist the development\r\n\r\nof agriculture.

Just now I was talking  about  the\r\n\r\nassistance given by the Primary Production Department\r\n\r\nto farmers. This has not been without any faults. The\r\n\r\nPrimary  Production Department has not done  well  in\r\n\r\ndisseminating agricultural knowledge to the  farmers.\r\n\r\nTake,  for  example,  the articles  in  the  Bulletin\r\n\r\npublished by the Department. They are normally  quite\r\n\r\nspecialised  in  nature.  Radio  broadcasts  to   the\r\n\r\nfarmers  are also quite sophisticated and the farmers\r\n\r\ndo  not  understand them. I suggest films  should  be\r\n\r\nmade    showing   the   technique   of   agricultural\r\n\r\nproduction.  These films should have an  accompanying\r\n\r\ncommentary  in  simple  local dialects  so  that  the\r\n\r\nfarmers  can benefit from them. There should also  be\r\n\r\nfrequent exchanges of opinions and views between  the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 627</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  farmers.  In  order that  the  farmers  are  not\r\n\r\nexploited   by   middle  men,  I  suggest   that   an\r\n\r\nagricultural  co-operative society  be  set  up.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  assist in  the  organisation  and\r\n\r\nadministration  of the society as  the  farmers  lack\r\n\r\nexperience in these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (National Development Division) (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, first of all, I feel that  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  of rural constituencies should understand\r\n\r\nthat,  in  the past, our country depended on entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade  which provided us with the sinews of  economic\r\n\r\nlife. But because of the growth in our population, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  industrialise at a quick pace in  order  to\r\n\r\ncreate  employment for our people. We should  not  be\r\n\r\nunder  the wrong impression that Singapore's  economy\r\n\r\nis  dependent on agriculture. Our discussions  should\r\n\r\nnot   be  based  on  that  and  we  should  not  view\r\n\r\nGovernment's  measures from  the  point  of  view  of\r\n\r\nagriculture alone. Unfortunately, Singapore has  only\r\n\r\n224  square  miles of land. She needs more  and  more\r\n\r\nland  for  industrialisation which is more  important\r\n\r\nthan any other project. Therefore, the land that  can\r\n\r\nbe  allotted  for agricultural purposes  is  limited.\r\n\r\nThis means that resettled farmers who are affected by\r\n\r\nour  various  schemes can only be allotted  up  to  a\r\n\r\nmaximum   of  two  acres  of  land  each  for   their\r\n\r\nagricultural  activities. The farmers should  not  be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied because they must understand  that  land\r\n\r\nis  limited  in  Singapore. In  future,  the  Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department will introduce farming in multi-\r\n\r\nstorey  flats. This is one of the measures to  remedy\r\n\r\nour shortage of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has just now mentioned that\r\n\r\nour  farmers  are quite backward in their  method  of\r\n\r\nagriculture   and   that   the   Primary   Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  has not looked after their  interest  and\r\n\r\nwelfare.  He  also  says that the total  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduce per year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namounts to $200 million. If our agricultural\r\n\r\nproduction is backward, how is it that it can amount\r\n\r\nto so-much a year? This clearly disproves, what the\r\n\r\nMember has said. The reason is that we have been\r\n\r\nproviding the farmers with modern scientific methods\r\n\r\nin agricultural activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid progress in industrialisation, many\r\n\r\nyouths from the rural\r\n\r\nareas will have to give up agricultural activities\r\n\r\nand take up jobs in the factories. I feel there is\r\n\r\nnothing wrong in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also-suggested the\r\n\r\nsetting up of a financial organisation to give\r\n\r\ninterest free loans to the farmers and the setting up\r\n\r\nof an agricultural co-operative society. As regards\r\n\r\nthe agricultural co-operative society, I must say\r\n\r\nthat the Primary Production Department did encourage\r\n\r\nthe farmers to form such a co-operative society. This\r\n\r\nmet with some success. But, unfortunately, the\r\n\r\norganisers lacked experience. There were also some\r\n\r\nirresponsible people in the society and, because of\r\n\r\ntheir improper activities, the society was not\r\n\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment provides the farmers with the latest\r\n\r\ntechniques in agriculture mainly through farmers'\r\n\r\nforums, radio broadcasts and also through the\r\n\r\nBulletin published by the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment. This has benefited the farmers very much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo not entirely share the views expressed by my\r\n\r\ncolleague, the Member for Jurong. But I think some of\r\n\r\nhis points are quite valid. As far as agricultural\r\n\r\nresearch is concerned, I think we are doing quite\r\n\r\nwell and the Primary Production Department should be\r\n\r\ncongratulated. I am also inclined to agree with the\r\n\r\nMember for Jurong when he said that there is some\r\n\r\nthing lacking in the liaison between the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department and the farmers. At times, the\r\n\r\nofficials responsible for the so-called extension\r\n\r\nservices do not appear to understand fully the\r\n\r\nmentality and outlook of the farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Bulletin published by the Primary Production Department. I think we must bear in mind that the majority of the farmers are not sufficiently educated to be able to understand it. This is the point made by the Member for Jurong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member's suggestion that in\r\n\r\norder to remedy the position, there should perhaps be\r\n\r\nregular discussions between the senior members of the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department and the farmers.  I  am\r\n\r\nquite  sure this will go a long way towards promoting\r\n\r\nbetter  mutual  understanding. Such sessions  can  be\r\n\r\nheld  at  community centres and I am quite  sure  the\r\n\r\nrural  Members  of Parliament will be very  happy  to\r\n\r\nparticipate in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate research and proper liaison is still not\r\n\r\nenough unless the farmers have the means to carry out\r\n\r\nthe new methods and techniques which we are trying to\r\n\r\nintroduce to them. The results of extensive  research\r\n\r\nmight  very  well be wasted.

In   our    agricultural\r\n\r\ndevelopment, I think we can draw inspiration from the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of Israel. If the land-hungry Israelis  can,\r\n\r\nout  of  waste  land, produce and export  the  world-\r\n\r\nfamous  Jaffa oranges, I am quite sure  we  can  rear\r\n\r\nenough  pigs  and  poultry in  multistorey  flats  to\r\n\r\nexport them to neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the reply given by the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  as he has not answered my various  points.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was not paying attention when I spoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sir, in order to progress, Government has\r\n\r\nto take certain measures and these measures are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nusually not popular with those having vested\r\n\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as fishing is concerned, when we started\r\n\r\nthis project of the fishing port plus a central\r\n\r\nmarket at Jurong, there was opposition from the\r\n\r\nEllenborough and Beach Road Markets and several\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament joined in this opposition.\r\n\r\nHence, the fishing market has not been started. The\r\n\r\nEllenborough Market has now been burnt and the fish\r\n\r\nmerchants are anxious to go to Jurong. So if there\r\n\r\nis any delay, it is not the fault of the Primary\r\n\r\nProduction Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give this as an example of the reason why the\r\n\r\nabattoirs at Jurong are not fully operational.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should first state the facts. Cattle\r\n\r\nslaughter was started in Jurong in October 1967,\r\n\r\nwhich is more than one year ago. The slaughter of\r\n\r\nsheep commenced in early January this year. About 50\r\n\r\nhead of cattle and about 350 head of sheep are being\r\n\r\nslaughtered daily in the abattoirs. What about pigs?\r\n\r\nThere was opposition to the move to go to Jurong and\r\n\r\nwe have not yet overcome such opposition. The\r\n\r\nslaughter of pigs in Jurong - if I can call them rural pigs commenced in \r\n\r\nJune 1968, and about 200 head of pigs from the rural areas\r\n\r\nare being slaughtered daily in Jurong. Pigs are still\r\n\r\nbeing slaughtered at the French Road Abattoir and\r\n\r\nabout 1,000 head of pigs are slaughtered there a day.\r\n\r\nThere has been strong opposition to move the\r\n\r\nslaughter of pigs from the French Road Abattoir to\r\n\r\nJurong, as there was opposition to the move as far as\r\n\r\ncattle and sheep were concerned. All sorts of red\r\n\r\nherrings are drawn. One such red herring is that the\r\n\r\nmeat of pigs slaughtered in Jurong becomes a little\r\n\r\npaler and this is bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Member to he patient as efforts are\r\n\r\nbeing made to complete the transfer. There is delay\r\n\r\nbecause of the opposition and the further\r\n\r\nrequirements demanded by pig butchers in respect of\r\n\r\nthe slaughter of their animals. They want additional\r\n\r\nfacilities and we are providing them with these\r\n\r\nfacilities. They want a separate room to clean the\r\n\r\nguts of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npigs,  and we provide them with a room.

The result of the present trend  in  car\r\n\r\nparking  in  the  city is the displacement  of  taxi-\r\n\r\ndrivers   from   their  usual  yellow  line   parking\r\n\r\nfacilities.  What makes the situation much  worse  is\r\n\r\nthat when licensed taxi-drivers attempt to park their\r\n\r\nvehicles  in  the paying parking lot, they  are  told\r\n\r\nthat  they  may  not  do so. This  not  only  imposes\r\n\r\ninconvenience but also hardship upon them. I am asked\r\n\r\nto  try  to adduce an explanation for this move.  Why\r\n\r\nshould  taxi-drivers be urged to be  continuously  on\r\n\r\nthe  move  throughout? They will have to  stop  their\r\n\r\nvehicles some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has also asked me to remind\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  when the people of  Singapore  were\r\n\r\nrequested to indicate their loyalty to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   country,  the  taxi-drivers  came  forth   with\r\n\r\n$100,000  for  the National Defence Fund.  These  are\r\n\r\nvalues   which  the  country  should  encourage   and\r\n\r\nrecognise. In view of the hardship that appears to be\r\n\r\nimposed  upon  the taxi-drivers without any  rational\r\n\r\nexplanation,  and  their  response  to  the  National\r\n\r\nDefence  Fund,  the  Member  for  Changi  would  like\r\n\r\nconsideration on their behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  raise one point under this subhead,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  car park at the People's Park.  In  my\r\n\r\nview,  it  is not proper to collect parking  fees  at\r\n\r\nnight at the People's Park because car owners already\r\n\r\nhave  to pay parking fees during the day. I feel that\r\n\r\nparking  fees  should  not be  collected  during  the\r\n\r\nnight.  For  example, if the Minister wishes  to  buy\r\n\r\nsomething at the People's Park, he has to pay  a  fee\r\n\r\nfor  a  parking  lot. I think this will  be  a  great\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to him. Therefore, he should  consider\r\n\r\nexempting  car  owners from paying  parking  fees  at\r\n\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\never   since  the  completion  of  the  new  shopping\r\n\r\nbuilding in the People's Park, many people have  been\r\n\r\nattracted  to  this area. We have provided  about  63\r\n\r\nparking  lots  there.  The  original  provisions   of\r\n\r\nparking  lots  was 63, but because  of  demands  from\r\n\r\nvarious  quarters, we have increased  the  number  of\r\n\r\nparking  lots  and also introduced a  paying  parking\r\n\r\nsystem in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have extended the time of pay parking from 9.00\r\n\r\na.m. to 4.00 p.m, for the first shift and from  4.30\r\n\r\np.m. to 11.00 p.m, for the second shift.

I was asked  whether  I  had  a\r\n\r\nrational  answer.  My  answer  is,  \"Yes,  I  have  a\r\n\r\nrational  answer.\" But perhaps, as the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence  is  not here, I should state in  this  House\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government  is  indeed  grateful  for  the\r\n\r\n$100,000  or  more  which was  raised  by  the  taxi-\r\n\r\ndrivers. But I am sure that the taxi-drivers, who are\r\n\r\nreasonable  men,  will understand that  because  they\r\n\r\nmade a generous gift to the Defence Fund, it does not\r\n\r\nmean  that they should be allowed to flout the  rules\r\n\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law lays down that taxi-drivers are not\r\n\r\nallowed  to  park  in places where the  ordinary  man\r\n\r\nparks  his  car.  The reason is quite  simple.  Taxi-\r\n\r\ndrivers are given their own taxi-stands and you and I\r\n\r\npark  in different places. When you want a taxi,  you\r\n\r\nknow  where  to  find one. But the  taxi-drivers  com\r\n\r\nplained. They said that they might take a tourist  to\r\n\r\nArab Street where there are no taxi-stands around and\r\n\r\nthat  therefore  they should be allowed  to  park  in\r\n\r\nplaces  where  you and I park our cars.  So  the  Car\r\n\r\nParks Division relaxed this rule some time this  year\r\n\r\nand  allowed taxi-drivers to park in places where the\r\n\r\nlaw does not allow them to park. But they abused this\r\n\r\nprivilege.  Instead  of  parking  there   and   doing\r\n\r\nnothing,  they parked there and plied for  hire  from\r\n\r\nthose  spots. There are places provided for  them  to\r\n\r\nply  for  hire. They abused the privilege  after  the\r\n\r\nrules  were relaxed. As a consequence, the  privilege\r\n\r\nwas withdrawn. But the taxi-drivers continued to park\r\n\r\nin  places  where  they should not  park  and,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult, about 255 summonses were issued and now there\r\n\r\nis  a  lot of correspondence between their solicitor,\r\n\r\nthe   head  of  the  Taxi-Drivers'  Association,  the\r\n\r\nTraffic Police and the Car Parks Division.

I assure the Member for Serangoon  Gardens\r\n\r\nthat  this  is not so. Instead, representations  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made  for  an increase in the number  of  taxi-\r\n\r\nstands.  They are being seriously considered  by  the\r\n\r\nCar Parks Division, and if a case is made out for  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the  demand for  taxi-stands,  we  will\r\n\r\nprovide more taxi-stands.

We\r\n\r\nknow  that the Urban and Rural Services Committee  is\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  construction  work  all  over   the\r\n\r\nisland.  We  also know that a lot of money  has  been\r\n\r\nallocated  for  construction  work,  including   road\r\n\r\nrepairs,   bridge   construction   and   water    and\r\n\r\nelectricity supply to the rural people because of the\r\n\r\nGovernment's determination to improve their lot.  The\r\n\r\nroads  in  the rural areas are normally  longer  than\r\n\r\nthose  in  the city areas. Laterite roads  are  in  a\r\n\r\nworse  state  of disrepair than metalled  roads.  The\r\n\r\nroads  in  the rural areas are not always kept  in  a\r\n\r\ngood  state  because  of the  limited  sum  of  money\r\n\r\nallocated for road repairs in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the U.R.S.C, started on a campaign of\r\n\r\ngotong   royong,  which  means  the  undertaking   of\r\n\r\nvoluntary road construction and road repairs  by  the\r\n\r\nrural people. The advantages of gotong royong are  as\r\n\r\nfollows.  Firstly,  if  the  people  are  engaged  in\r\n\r\nvoluntary  rural  construction work,  the  Government\r\n\r\nwill be able to save some money which can be used for\r\n\r\nother  more urgent projects. Secondly, gotong  royong\r\n\r\nwill  promote  a sense of national consciousness  and\r\n\r\npatriotism  and  foster friendship  among  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople.  As  a  result  of toiling  and  sweating  on\r\n\r\nconstruction work in the rural areas, the people will\r\n\r\ndevelop a particular love for their areas as well  as\r\n\r\nfor the country as a whole. Thirdly, we know that the\r\n\r\nstate  of disrepair of rural roads is due to lack  of\r\n\r\ncare and maintenance. The drains are clogged and  the\r\n\r\nwater  in  them overflows on to the roads  which  are\r\n\r\nfurther  damaged.  If the people make  up  their  own\r\n\r\nroads  and  drains, they will naturally  pay  special\r\n\r\nattention to maintain them in good condition, and the\r\n\r\nGovernment will therefore save a lot of public  funds\r\n\r\nof  maintenance. Fourthly, the collective  effort  of\r\n\r\nvillagers  of  different races in a common  endeavour\r\n\r\nwill promote better understanding among them and help\r\n\r\nto establish a multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.09 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in the rural areas have responded in\r\n\r\ngreat  numbers to the call made by the  U.R.S.C, for\r\n\r\nthe setting up of gotong royong. The people living in\r\n\r\nBukit  Timah, Bukit Panjang, Tampines, Sembawang  and\r\n\r\nother  areas  have already, on their own,  undertaken\r\n\r\nroad  repair schemes and the results have  been  very\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  But, unfortunately,  I  have  recently\r\n\r\nbeen  given to understand that the U.R.S.C, will  no\r\n\r\nlonger  encourage gotong royong. I do  not  know  why\r\n\r\nthere  should be a change of mind on their  part.  My\r\n\r\nguess  is that probably the people in charge want  to\r\n\r\navoid  the work that they will have to put  in.  They\r\n\r\nwill  have to liaise, organise, supply tools and take\r\n\r\npart  in opening ceremonies. All this takes a lot  of\r\n\r\ntime  and trouble. It is easier for them to  ask  for\r\n\r\ntenders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have indicated earlier, gotong royong is of\r\n\r\ngreat  significance, particularly  at  this  juncture\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are faced with a standstill Budget.  Gotong\r\n\r\nroyong is, in fact, necessary. Therefore, I appeal to\r\n\r\nthe U.R.S.C, to continue with it. They should not  be\r\n\r\nafraid to face any difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will explain why gotong royong\r\n\r\nis not being encouraged further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng)</b>: Madam Chan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   undoubtedly   a   great   deal   of\r\n\r\nconstruction  work has been undertaken in  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.  This  has  had a marked  improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nappearance  of  the  rural  areas.  In  spite  of  an\r\n\r\nincrease in defence expenditure, about $2 million has\r\n\r\nbeen  allocated for rural development. A sum  of  $12\r\n\r\nmillion  has  also been allocated for the  supply  of\r\n\r\nelectricity to the rural areas in the next few years.\r\n\r\nWe should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  proud  of this scheme. However, I feel  that  the\r\n\r\nwork  in  the  rural  areas is not  progressing  fast\r\n\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, it takes about a year or more\r\n\r\nbefore work can be started on any scheme approved  by\r\n\r\nthe  U.R.S.C. I think some improvement should be made\r\n\r\nin  this  regard.  If  the  Ministry  will  note  the\r\n\r\nadministrative inefficiency or causes of  delay,  and\r\n\r\ntake  action  to  remedy it, I think  work  could  be\r\n\r\nstarted earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is in relation to the rural roads.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, roads in the rural areas are not  as\r\n\r\ndurable as those in other areas. For example,  in  my\r\n\r\narea, after a period of eight years we find a lot  of\r\n\r\npotholes  in  the roads. It is probably  because  the\r\n\r\nroads  were not properly made up, or it may  be  that\r\n\r\nthe contractors did not carry out their work well and\r\n\r\nthe materials were not according to specifications. I\r\n\r\nthink  Members of Parliament in the rural areas  have\r\n\r\nreceived  a great many complaints in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe  situation is rather serious because public funds\r\n\r\nare  involved. We must see to it that the contractors\r\n\r\nundertaking road construction and road repairs in the\r\n\r\nrural areas carry out their work with materials  that\r\n\r\nare  according to specifications. All the Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament  in the rural areas have their  eyes  wide\r\n\r\nopen  and  you  cannot  bluff them,  especially  when\r\n\r\ncomplaints are forthcoming from the country folk.  If\r\n\r\nany  contractor  is guilty of any failure  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  the specifications, we must see to it  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not do it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I endorse the views expressed by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Jurong on gotong royong. I think the work done by\r\n\r\nthe gotong royong people is much better than that  of\r\n\r\nthe  contractors. They use materials provided by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  These  are genuine  and  up  to  specifi\r\n\r\ncations.  If the work costs, say, $20,000  if  it  is\r\n\r\ndone by a contractor, it will only cost about $10,000\r\n\r\nif it is done\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the  gotong  royong people.  The  roads-too  have\r\n\r\ngreater durability. Therefore,, we have no reason not\r\n\r\nto encourage gotong royong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  on the question of gotong royong raised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong, the explanation is  this.  In\r\n\r\nthe past, gotong royong members were charged with the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of road building in the  rural  areas.\r\n\r\nThe  enthusiasm  shown  by the  volunteers  was  very\r\n\r\nimpressive.  We  were  very  appreciative   of   such\r\n\r\nenthusiasm.  But the making of roads  by  the  gotong\r\n\r\nroyong  members  was  not  properly  organised.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the  first two days,  the  performance\r\n\r\nwould be very impressive. But after the third day  on\r\n\r\nthe  job,  which  would require a week  to  complete,\r\n\r\nthere  would be less and less workers. And the people\r\n\r\nwho  deserted their jobs included the M.P.s! So  what\r\n\r\ndid  you expect us to do? The work was only half done\r\n\r\nwhen  the workers started running away. As a  result,\r\n\r\nwe  had no choice but to get in touch with the P.W.D.\r\n\r\nto engage casual labourers to complete the work. This\r\n\r\nwas  the  problem we had to face. Of  course,  gotong\r\n\r\nroyong by itself is good and it has significance. But\r\n\r\nthe members of gotong royong were not able to sustain\r\n\r\ntheir  enthusiasm  throughout the  period  needed  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  the work. There was a lack of organisation.\r\n\r\nIf  the  Member for Jurong can assure us that he  can\r\n\r\nstart gotong royong in his own constituency and  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  the  work can be completed  according  to\r\n\r\nschedule  without  any  problem,  we  will  have   no\r\n\r\nobjection.  In  fact,  we  will  give  him  all   the\r\n\r\nnecessary  encouragement. We will also encourage  the\r\n\r\nMembers   of   Parliament   in   the   other    rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies to carry on with their gotong royong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the allegation that we are not encouraging\r\n\r\ngotong royong because we are afraid of trouble,  this\r\n\r\nis  unfounded. As I have already explained, there is\r\n\r\na good reason why gotong royong can not be encouraged\r\n\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complained of the one-year\r\n\r\nor more delay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  the  commencement of work after plans  have  been\r\n\r\napproved.  We have approved seven plans in  1968  for\r\n\r\nthe Sembawang area. Six of these schemes have already\r\n\r\nbeen  completed. The remaining one is  about  80  per\r\n\r\ncent completed. One scheme has not been completed. It\r\n\r\nwas  approved  only on 6th October  this  year.  They\r\n\r\nallegation  of the Member for Sembawang is  therefore\r\n\r\ntotally unfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I must admit that he has made a\r\n\r\nvery  good suggestion on another aspect. He said that\r\n\r\nthe roads built by the contractors are not as durable\r\n\r\nas others. If Members of Parliament or members of the\r\n\r\nCitizens'    Consultative   Committees    in    their\r\n\r\nconstituencies should come across work undertaken  by\r\n\r\na  contractor  on tender, then I would urge  them  to\r\n\r\nsupervise the work from time to time. They could make\r\n\r\na  spot check, and the contractor would therefore  do\r\n\r\nmore  satisfactory work. I have to remind the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  on one point. When a  road  has  been\r\n\r\nrepaired,  the contractor doing it has  to  guarantee\r\n\r\nfor  a  period  of six months that any damage  to  it\r\n\r\nwould  be his responsibility. If the Member has  come\r\n\r\nacross  any such cases, he can draw our attention  to\r\n\r\nthem.

The main purpose was to give farm youths\r\n\r\nbasic training in agriculture. With the knowledge and\r\n\r\nskill acquired, they could impart their knowledge and\r\n\r\ntrain  the  farmers  as well. I understand  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is spending about $90,000 per year on  the\r\n\r\nschool.  About  a dozen graduates are produced  every\r\n\r\nyear.  On the average, about $8,000 is spent on  each\r\n\r\ngraduate every year. This school also trains teachers\r\n\r\nin the rural areas. However, the expenditure on these\r\n\r\nteachers  is  borne by the Ministry of  Education.

This means that the  $8,000\r\n\r\nthat  is  being spent on each graduate is  wasted.

Forty-six of these youths were from\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas.

Now they have\r\n\r\nalready  become  qualified  teachers  and  have  been\r\n\r\nposted  to the vocational schools in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nteaching subjects on agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other 46 graduates, namely, those\r\n\r\nyouths from the rural areas, the employment situation\r\n\r\nis  as  follows. Thirteen of them returned  to  their\r\n\r\nfarms. Seven were employed in farms doing farm  work.\r\n\r\nAnother   seven  were  engaged  in  the  fish-rearing\r\n\r\nbusiness.

Rather,  they  have  used\r\n\r\nmethods of persuasion and now all fish merchants  are\r\n\r\nanxious to go to Jurong. But to show their bona fides\r\n\r\nand in order that the allegation is not made that the\r\n\r\nDirector of Primary Production is forcing them to  go\r\n\r\nto  Jurong,  he has asked them to pay  a  deposit  of\r\n\r\n$500.  This  money has been paid and shows  that  the\r\n\r\nfish  agents and merchants are not being  forced  but\r\n\r\nthat  they  want to go. But then when they agreed  to\r\n\r\ngo, they asked for more space at the Fishing Port and\r\n\r\nAuction Markets, and this is being provided.  I  have\r\n\r\nthe  figures  here. In fact, an initial  area  of  11\r\n\r\nacres   has  been  developed  and  another  28  acres\r\n\r\nreserved for future expansion. Seven hundred feet  of\r\n\r\nwharf  is ready for immediate use.

I\r\n\r\nwish   to  express  my  views  and  also  make   some\r\n\r\ncriticisms on these topics. No one can deny that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has achieved great success in its  housing\r\n\r\nprogramme. Even some members of the Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nhave admitted that the Government has been successful\r\n\r\nin  this field. This success can be attributed to the\r\n\r\nefforts of the National Development Division and  the\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has built\r\n\r\nthousands  and thousands of flats all over Singapore.\r\n\r\nGenerally  speaking,  the flats  constructed  by  the\r\n\r\nBoard  are  of  the low-cost type and people  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  and  lower income groups are  able  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nmodern  housing  facilities.  We  can  now  see   the\r\n\r\nmaterialisation  of  the  Government's  programme  in\r\n\r\nproviding  low-cost  housing  for  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroup. The Government has fulfilled its promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the standard of living in Singapore has\r\n\r\nimproved, it is probable that those in the middle  or\r\n\r\nupper  middle income groups will be able to buy their\r\n\r\nown  houses,  and, in view of this, the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  has started  the  home  ownership\r\n\r\nscheme. The tenants of Housing Board flats can either\r\n\r\nbuy  or  lease their flats. But beginning  from  this\r\n\r\nyear  there  has been a slight change in the  Board's\r\n\r\npolicy.  I understand the Board have decided to  sell\r\n\r\nas  many  of  their flats as possible to the  people,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of whether they are new  applicants  or\r\n\r\nexisting tenants. The people are allowed to make  use\r\n\r\nof  their deposits in the Central Provident  Fund  to\r\n\r\nbuy  flats  constructed by the Board  in  order  that\r\n\r\nthose  in  the lower income group may own  their  own\r\n\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to raise one point. Not everybody in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  sufficient deposits  in  the  Central\r\n\r\nProvident  Fund  to  buy a flat. For  example,  those\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  are  self-employed  do  not  have   any\r\n\r\ndeposits  in the Central Provident Fund and  so  they\r\n\r\ncannot buy their own houses. The same also applies in\r\n\r\nthe case of widows who are riot working. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthose who are casual workers may not necessarily have\r\n\r\nC.P.F, contributions.  As  far  as  I   know,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  is  that  all  the  flats,   if\r\n\r\npossible  should  be sold. In these circumstances,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to ask the Minister what consideration will  be\r\n\r\ngiven  to  the  categories  of  people  that  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned.  Will  they be allowed to  continue  their\r\n\r\ntenancy  in the Board's flats if they are  unable  to\r\n\r\nbuy  the  flats they are occupying? If they  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed to continue tenancy in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  flats, will they be asked to leave  the  flats\r\n\r\nthey  are  occupying and move to some rural area  far\r\n\r\naway  from  their places of work? in my constituency,\r\n\r\nabout  90  per  cent of the tenants living  in  these\r\n\r\nflats  are rather worried about this policy.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe Minister will answer the queries I have raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to deal with is in regard\r\n\r\nto  the urban renewal scheme now being undertaken  by\r\n\r\nthe  National  Development Division. No  sane  person\r\n\r\nwill  oppose this scheme, but the question  is  this.\r\n\r\nHow  are we to improve the technical aspects  of  the\r\n\r\nurban  renewal  scheme?  This question  deserves  our\r\n\r\nattention.  We  all know that most of the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  concentrated in the  city,  in  areas\r\n\r\naround  Robinsons and Collyer Quay. These places  are\r\n\r\noccupied by large business enterprises, but the small\r\n\r\nbusinesses   are   found  in  Chinatown,   in   areas\r\n\r\nsurrounding  Kreta  Ayer. The  small  businessmen  in\r\n\r\nthese   areas   have   a  long-established   business\r\n\r\ninherited  from  their  ancestors,  and  they  depend\r\n\r\nentirely  on  their  business for a  livelihood.  The\r\n\r\npremises  in  which they operate their  business  are\r\n\r\nvery  old and the rent is therefore very cheap. There\r\n\r\nare  some  misgivings among these  small  businessmen\r\n\r\nbecause they fear that their places of business  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected  by the urban renewal scheme.  They  are\r\n\r\nworried  that if a certain area in the city is  zoned\r\n\r\nfor  urban  renewal, they will have to  be  resettled\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  Where  they will be resettled  remains  a\r\n\r\nquestion.   In  other  words,  there  is   no   prior\r\n\r\nindication of where they will be resettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that socialist democracy means that the people must work for what they get. As the urban renewal scheme is being undertaken vigorously, these small businessmen have to be resettled elsewhere. If we do not pull down the old buildings, we cannot have new ones. I wish to\r\n\r\nelaborate   on  this  point.  On  the  principle   of\r\n\r\nsocialism -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Of  course,  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board will reduce the difficulties to the\r\n\r\nminimum.  The  sale of flats in Delta is  now  in  an\r\n\r\nexperimental  stage and has not been  finalised  yet.\r\n\r\nOnly a proportion of the flats are being offered  for\r\n\r\nsale.  At  the moment, we have 100,000 Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflats of which only ten per cent have been sold.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment does not adopt a rigid and harsh  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards the occupiers of the flats which we intend to\r\n\r\nsell.  We welcome those who are able to buy the flats\r\n\r\nin  which  they are staying.

This department\r\n\r\nis spending a great deal of money on the construction\r\n\r\nof    roads   and   bridges.   In   view    of    our\r\n\r\nindustrialisation programme and national development,\r\n\r\nI feel that this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\ndepartment  should  have  close  liaison  with  other\r\n\r\nMinistries,  such  as the Ministry of  Communications\r\n\r\nand  the  Ministry of Defence. Roads  and  pedestrian\r\n\r\nbridges are being built by the P.W.D, involving great\r\n\r\nsums  of  money.  We often find that soon  after  the\r\n\r\nroads  have  been repaired, they are  damaged  again.\r\n\r\nThey  will thus need repairing again. The P.U.B, will\r\n\r\ndig  up the road to lay down cables. In the end  they\r\n\r\nwill have to make up the road again. This will result\r\n\r\nin a great loss of money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also certain hazards for road users under\r\n\r\nthese  conditions. Many accidents occurred in  Scotts\r\n\r\nRoad when construction work was going on there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pedestrian path was built along the road. One or\r\n\r\ntwo months after its completion the authorities found\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to widen the road. As  a  result,  the\r\n\r\npedestrian  path was broken up. After  the  road  was\r\n\r\nwidened, the pedestrian path was again constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of side walks and roads costs a lot\r\n\r\nof  money. If there had been proper liaison among the\r\n\r\nMinistries concerned, large sums of money could  have\r\n\r\nbeen  saved. They would not have squandered money  in\r\n\r\nthat manner. The construction of a road should not be\r\n\r\ndone  in  an ad hoc manner. It is a long-term project\r\n\r\nand   there   should  be  co-ordination   among   the\r\n\r\ndepartments concerned to ensure that there will be no\r\n\r\nwaste of public funds. In addition, there will be  no\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion at the places where  construction\r\n\r\nwork  is being undertaken and there will also be less\r\n\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I support the Member for  Delta.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of vehicles in Singapore is increasing  every\r\n\r\nday.  The  roads  seem  to be  getting  narrower  and\r\n\r\nnarrower.  They do not seem to be able to  cope  with\r\n\r\nthe  increased number of vehicles, especially  during\r\n\r\nthe  peak  hours  when people go to  and  from  their\r\n\r\noffices.  The  Government, of course,  realises  this\r\n\r\nposition  and has taken steps to wi~1en the roads  in\r\n\r\norder  to  improve traffic conditions and  solve  the\r\n\r\nproblem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  congestion.  This  responsibility  falls  on  the\r\n\r\nPublic Works Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the engineers in the Public Works Department adopt only temporary measures to meet the present circumstances. Their only means of improving the roads is to widen them. Of course this will temporarily solve the problem of congestion on the roads. But in the long run, the widening of the roads\r\n\r\nis  not  a permanent solution as a means of improving\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestions.  The  number  of  vehicles   is\r\n\r\nincreasing  every  day. Does it mean  also  that  the\r\n\r\nroads  will  have to be widened every day?  When  the\r\n\r\nengineers in the P.W.D, try to widen the roads  every\r\n\r\nyear, they should consider the fact that Singapore is\r\n\r\nonly  an  island of 224 square miles. On the average,\r\n\r\nabout 8,000 people live in a square mile. Our land is\r\n\r\nvery valuable. The widening of roads will encroach on\r\n\r\nmany other areas. There will be no problem if a place\r\n\r\nhas  few  people. But the areas where the  roads  are\r\n\r\nbeing  widened  are  usually crowded.  Demolition  of\r\n\r\nstructures will have to take place. We will then have\r\n\r\nto   resettle  people  to  another  place  and   also\r\n\r\ncompensate  them.  From the  point  of  view  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  it  is  an encroachment on  their  right  of\r\n\r\nproperty and freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me enumerate the disadvantages of widening\r\n\r\nroads.  First, it will cause a feeling of  resentment\r\n\r\nin  the people. When part of the land is affected  by\r\n\r\nthe  widening  of  a road, the people  affected  will\r\n\r\nalways find difficulty moving to another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, they feel that the widening of roads will\r\n\r\ninconvenience  them and they are disgusted  with  it.\r\n\r\nRoad  widening also adversely affects their business.\r\n\r\nWe  are  aware  that  quite  often  a  whole  row  of\r\n\r\nshophouses are affected and the shopkeepers  find  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to carry on their business. As  a  result,\r\n\r\ntheir  livelihood is affected. I wish to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse of an instance of the people in my constituency\r\n\r\nwho are affected by the widening of roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parts of Paya Lebar Road need widening. At Paya\r\n\r\nLebar,   there   is   a  road   which   is   in   two\r\n\r\nconstituencies. This is rather strange. The  engineer\r\n\r\nof  the Public Works Department who was in charge  of\r\n\r\nthis  project  either  purposely  or  unintentionally\r\n\r\nconstructed the road to lead into two constituencies.\r\n\r\nBut  only  the portion of the road in my constituency\r\n\r\nwas affected by road widening. I do not know why this\r\n\r\nwas so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The widening of Upper Paya Lebar Road has created a\r\n\r\nsomewhat odd situation. The main part of the road  is\r\n\r\nvery  wide.  But  before reaching Paya  Lebar  Police\r\n\r\nStation,  it is very narrow. Therefore,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nbottleneck  at  this  end and  very  often  there  is\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestion. And it will be strange if  there\r\n\r\nare  no  accidents at this place. It is not difficult\r\n\r\nto  imagine what will happen there. I have  consulted\r\n\r\nthe   engineer   concerned,   but   he   evades   his\r\n\r\nresponsibility. He says that the plan  has  not  been\r\n\r\nfinalised.  Until  today, nothing has  been  done  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  situation, and I am sure  Members  will\r\n\r\nagree with me that this is rather odd. If there is  a\r\n\r\nbottleneck, how can you expect to have a free flow of\r\n\r\ntraffic? Just fill a bottle with water, then plug  up\r\n\r\nthe neck of the bottle and try to pour out the water.\r\n\r\nSee whether it can flow out freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, I fully support the widening of roads.\r\n\r\nBut   we   should   take   into   consideration   the\r\n\r\ntopographical  condition of  the  area  affected.  We\r\n\r\nshould  also  take into consideration  the  financial\r\n\r\nmeans  of our people. If the project is not suitable,\r\n\r\nwe  should think of some other schemes. For instance,\r\n\r\nwe  can  build a traffic network above the ground  or\r\n\r\nbuild underground tunnels. This new plan is worth our\r\n\r\nconsideration. Of course, I realise that the  traffic\r\n\r\nproblem  is  a  major problem in all big  cities.  In\r\n\r\nLondon  and Tokyo, the number of vehicles  cannot  be\r\n\r\nless  than  that in Singapore. I am sure it  is  many\r\n\r\ntimes  more. But I do not see how the roads in London\r\n\r\ncan be any wider than those\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. From this fact, we should consider our\r\n\r\nproblem especially when it relates to the size of the\r\n\r\nland   and  when  the  problem  affects  the   people\r\n\r\nfinancially.  We  should try  to  solve  the  traffic\r\n\r\nproblem  in  this  light. We must  not  be  like  the\r\n\r\nengineer  who  is in charge of the Upper  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nRoad road-widening project. He ordered the demolition\r\n\r\nof houses as he wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I hope that the P.W.D, road engineers\r\n\r\nwill  learn  a lesson from London, like  building  an\r\n\r\nunderground railway system which, in my opinion, is a\r\n\r\nvery  good  system. The underground  tube  system  in\r\n\r\nLondon  provides  the  major  means  of  transporting\r\n\r\nmillions  of workers in London with great  speed  and\r\n\r\nalmost  without any accidents. It is  both  fast  and\r\n\r\nsafe.  I feel that our engineers here should  take  a\r\n\r\ncue from them. I must say that Rome was not built  in\r\n\r\na  day.  Of  course, time is necessary to  solve  the\r\n\r\ntraffic   problem.  Anyway,  we  have   to   consider\r\n\r\ncarefully our plans to solve it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The construction  of\r\n\r\nroundabouts  at  cross-roads  costs  Government  some\r\n\r\nmoney  and  also causes inconvenience to the  public.\r\n\r\nThe   demolition  of  such  roundabouts  again  costs\r\n\r\nGovernment  some money and also causes  inconvenience\r\n\r\nto the public. I would like to know from the Minister\r\n\r\nif care can be taken in planning the roundabouts. One\r\n\r\nexample  is the roundabout at the junction of Rochore\r\n\r\nCanal Road, Jalan Besar and Bencoolen Street. It  was\r\n\r\nconstructed only a few years ago and now it is to  be\r\n\r\ndemolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I deal with each\r\n\r\nMember  in turn? In the case of the Member for Delta,\r\n\r\nmay  I say that, in my view, there was much substance\r\n\r\nand  common  sense in what she said  about  the  road\r\n\r\ndigging  that  goes  on  in Singapore.  When  my  pre\r\n\r\ndecessor, Mr Lim Kim San, took over the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development, he was not satisfied with  the\r\n\r\ncombined efforts of the Public Works Department,  the\r\n\r\nPublic   Utilities  Board,  the  Singapore  Telephone\r\n\r\nBoard,  the  Traffic Department and the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nVehicles at either digging up or defacing the road or\r\n\r\ndrawing lines on the road. It was then common to  see\r\n\r\na road being resurfaced and then a week later another\r\n\r\nstatutory  department digs a trench either along  the\r\n\r\nroad  or  across it to lay pipes for water or  cables\r\n\r\nfor electricity, gas or telephones. The then Minister\r\n\r\nfor National Development formed a committee called  a\r\n\r\nLiaison Committee whereby the heads of various depart\r\n\r\nments  in the statutory boards would meet - in  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  have  since  met every month -  to  co-ordinate\r\n\r\ntheir  plans in an effort to cause less inconvenience\r\n\r\nto  the  public.  There has been  co-operation,  but,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  it has not met with one  hundred  per\r\n\r\ncent  success  and  there have been  instances  where\r\n\r\nroads have been dug up immediately after resurfacing.\r\n\r\nThis  is  highly undesirable. Only last week,  I  had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  call  the heads of  departments  for  a\r\n\r\nmeeting  to  try  once  again  to  co-ordinate  their\r\n\r\nefforts  at  road digging. I asked them whether  they\r\n\r\nall  could  use one trench. They said, \"No.\"  It  was\r\n\r\ndangerous  to  put  gas pipes too close  to  electric\r\n\r\ncables.  I  am  no expert. Some had to dig  one  foot\r\n\r\nunder   the  road  and  some  had  to  go  six   feet\r\n\r\nunderneath.  And they said that they  could  not  dig\r\n\r\ntogether.  Otherwise the public would  be  even  more\r\n\r\ninconvenienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back to the law, it provides for - statutory\r\n\r\nboards to dig a road as and when they please to lay a\r\n\r\ngas   pipe  or  water  main.  I  think  the  law   is\r\n\r\nreasonable.  Otherwise  you  and  I  will  not   have\r\n\r\nelectricity, water or gas. So\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroads must be dug up. I think we must accept that.  I\r\n\r\ncan amend the law and take away these powers and only\r\n\r\nallow  statutory  boards to dig up a  road  when  the\r\n\r\nDirector  of Public Works gives them permission.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  happens  in  the  case of  an  emergency?  What\r\n\r\nhappens if there is a gas leak and the road is likely\r\n\r\nto  explode? What happens when there is a water leak?\r\n\r\nDo  we wait for a flood? There are cases of emergency\r\n\r\nwhich  must be met at once. Hence this law.  But  the\r\n\r\nnet  result of this meeting was a decision that, when\r\n\r\na road is newly surfaced, nobody can dig up that road\r\n\r\nwithout  the  permission of the  Director  of  Public\r\n\r\nWorks except in cases of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given this direction and we will see how it\r\n\r\nworks. There is apparently a considerable measure  of\r\n\r\nco-ordination but in a few cases there  is  not.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Delta  has mentioned  Scotts  Road.  She\r\n\r\npasses there every day and I am in sympathy with her.\r\n\r\nI  pass along other roads which have been affected in\r\n\r\nthe  same  way, and I am sure Members here pass  some\r\n\r\nother  roads,  like  the Member for  Paya  Lebar  who\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  against the widening of  Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nRoad. He says there are lots of vehicles in Singapore\r\n\r\nand  we  should  meet this increase  in  our  traffic\r\n\r\nproblems  by  other processes, for instance,  digging\r\n\r\nunder the road or going overhead. He mentions London,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  an  underground system, and Tokyo,  which\r\n\r\nalso  has an underground system and a monorail system\r\n\r\nover the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered these possibilities. A monorail\r\n\r\nis  a very expensive mass transit system and, for the\r\n\r\nmoment,  it  is out of the reach of our pockets.  The\r\n\r\nunderground system has been looked into and  we  have\r\n\r\nthe  reports  of several experts. I will  not  bother\r\n\r\nMembers  with these reports, but for the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Paya Lebar, the difference  between\r\n\r\nPaya  Lebar and London is this. In London,  when  you\r\n\r\ndig, there is no water; but in Paya\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLebar, when you dig one foot, it is flooded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar also complains of the\r\n\r\nbottleneck at Paya Lebar Police Station. Last year he\r\n\r\nmade  representations on behalf of  his  constituents\r\n\r\nliving  along  Paya Lebar Road who were very  unhappy\r\n\r\nabout  having  their houses or part of  their  houses\r\n\r\ndemolished  for  the sake of road widening.  This  is\r\n\r\nnatural,  but I think I can deal with the  Member  in\r\n\r\none   sentence,  by  telling  him  that  if  all  his\r\n\r\nrepresentations  were accepted,  the  whole  of  Paya\r\n\r\nLebar  Road would be like the junction at Paya  Lebar\r\n\r\nPolice  Station. You will have a road  which  is  in,\r\n\r\nout,  narrow and wide from Paya Lebar Police  Station\r\n\r\nto Geylang Serai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson is upset by the fact that\r\n\r\nroundabouts  are  going to be disturbed.  There  have\r\n\r\nbeen other circuses in Singapore which have also been\r\n\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Recent traffic  studies  have\r\n\r\nindicated that an improved circulation of traffic can\r\n\r\nbe  attained  by  turning Jalan Besar  and  Bencoolen\r\n\r\nStreet  into  a  one-way  system.  For  this  to   be\r\n\r\nfeasible,  the  traffic circus has to  be  abolished,\r\n\r\njust  like the circus in front of the Istana and  the\r\n\r\nGrange Road circus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I end on one note by asking Members of\r\n\r\nParliament to let me know if there is too  much  road\r\n\r\ndigging  in  their constituencies,  or  a  road  just\r\n\r\nsurfaced has been dug up the next day or next week.

But like other countries,  we\r\n\r\nstill  have  the  division between  rural  and  urban\r\n\r\nareas. According to a survey held in 1967, there  are\r\n\r\nabout 550,000 people living in the rural areas,  that\r\n\r\nis to say, about one-third of our population is found\r\n\r\nin   the  rural  areas.  They  live  in  unauthorised\r\n\r\nstructures built some 10 to 20 years ago. They had no\r\n\r\nbuilding plans for the construction of their huts  or\r\n\r\nhouses.  But now, 20 years later, their attap  houses\r\n\r\nhave  to be repaired and the same materials were used\r\n\r\nfor  repair. Since there were no building  plans  for\r\n\r\ntheir structures, their applications for repair  were\r\n\r\ninvariably  turned down. The rural people  then  took\r\n\r\nthe  law  into  their own hands by carrying  out  the\r\n\r\nrepairs without applying for permission to do so, and\r\n\r\nwhen  the  repairs  were completed,  the  authorities\r\n\r\nserved  summonses on them. Action was promptly  taken\r\n\r\nby the authorities to demolish whatever was put up by\r\n\r\nthem.  As a result of this drastic action, the  rural\r\n\r\nfolk  are suffering great hardship. They do not  know\r\n\r\nwhere to air their grievances. Will the Minister give\r\n\r\nspecial  consideration to their applications for  the\r\n\r\nrepair of their huts built 10 to 20 years ago?  There\r\n\r\nshould  be  a relaxation of the regulations governing\r\n\r\nthe  applications  for repairs. In other  words,  the\r\n\r\nauthorities should not insist on the production of  a\r\n\r\nbuilding  plan  and evidence that the structures  are\r\n\r\nmore than 10 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next point I wish to raise is this. In\r\n\r\nrural areas like Paya Lebar these have been cases  of\r\n\r\nnatural  calamities such as houses being  crushed  by\r\n\r\nfallen coconut trees and the roofs being blown off by\r\n\r\nthe wind. It is, of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  not  possible to stop these  calamities  but\r\n\r\nthere  is one thing we can do. In the event  of  such\r\n\r\ncalamities,   can   the  authorities   give   special\r\n\r\npermission  for immediate repairs to be  carried  out\r\n\r\nwithout  going through the rigmarole of applying  and\r\n\r\nwaiting  for approval? Otherwise the people  affected\r\n\r\nmay have to sleep on the road or even in the pigsties\r\n\r\nbefore approval is finally given. I hope the Minister\r\n\r\nwill,    in   these   circumstances,   give   special\r\n\r\nconsideration to such cases instead of  insisting  on\r\n\r\ncompliance with the routine procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Paya Lebar raised matters concerning\r\n\r\nattap  huts  in  the rural areas.

I am afraid I am  unable  to\r\n\r\ngive  a definite answer to this query. But, generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  the age of attap huts in the  rural  areas\r\n\r\ncan be proved by the owners by way of rent receipts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are more than ten years old and require\r\n\r\nrepairs, we will give consideration to the merits  of\r\n\r\neach  case,  depending,  of course,  on  whether  the\r\n\r\nstructures  were  put up legally or  whether  special\r\n\r\npermission ha-d first been obtained. I do  not  think\r\n\r\nit  is  difficult to get approval for repairs  to  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  if  the procedures have  been  complied\r\n\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of damage to huts as a result of natural\r\n\r\ncalamities,  I think prompt permission is  given  for\r\n\r\nrepairs  to  be  carried out.

As outpatient services are\r\n\r\nprovided in all clinics, the outpatient clinic in the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital has fewer emergency cases  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith.

The nurse uttered these unkind words\r\n\r\nto  her,  \"Why have you forgotten to bring the  birth\r\n\r\ncertificate,   whereas   you   do   not   forget   to\r\n\r\n`manufacture' children?\" This, Mr Speaker, Sir,  was\r\n\r\nmost disgraceful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  the hospital staff are Government servants.  This\r\n\r\nwas  embarrassing to the mother, although  both  were\r\n\r\nwomen.  Such incidents have also occurred at  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital. I hope the-Minister will take  steps\r\n\r\nto  improve the situation and see that such incidents\r\n\r\nare not repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I would like to\r\n\r\nraise  two  points regarding Kandang Kerbau Hospital.\r\n\r\nWe all know that in the past a good percentage of the\r\n\r\nmortality  rate was due to tuberculosis, but  now  in\r\n\r\nmost  cases  people -die of cancer. Many  women  have\r\n\r\ndied  of womb cancer. This is about one-third of  the\r\n\r\nfemale mortality rate. The situation is very serious.\r\n\r\nWe  do not know what steps the Ministry of Health  is\r\n\r\ntaking  to  remedy the situation, especially  against\r\n\r\nwomb cancer. In the case of tuberculosis, there is  a\r\n\r\nsemi-Government   body,  S.A.T.A.,   which   provides\r\n\r\nfacilities for the prevention and treatment  of  T.B.\r\n\r\nAt  the moment, there may be a cancer centre but  the\r\n\r\nservices  rendered are slow. No prophylactic measures\r\n\r\nhave been taken to prevent the occurrence of cancer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that a cancer preventive centre be set up\r\n\r\nin  Kandang Kerbau Hospital so that people  suspected\r\n\r\nof  having cancer or even people who do not have  the\r\n\r\ndisease  may  go there for examination. According  to\r\n\r\nmedical  science  cancer  is  curable  in  the  early\r\n\r\nstages. I hope the Minister will set up such a centre\r\n\r\nin  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. I know that the  doctors\r\n\r\nin  this  hospital agree with me on this point,  but,\r\n\r\naccording  to them, it may well be that the  Minister\r\n\r\ndid  not  set  up  this centre  because  of  lack  of\r\n\r\nfinances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to speak on the services rendered by\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau Hospital. Many pregnant  mothers  who\r\n\r\nwent there found that there were not enough beds  for\r\n\r\nthem  in  the wards. Very often they had to sleep  in\r\n\r\nbeds  along  the  corridor after their  delivery.  It\r\n\r\nwould  be several days before they could get beds  in\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwards.  This  is a very dangerous situation,  because\r\n\r\nafter  delivery a mother may suffer an ailment caused\r\n\r\nby  being  exposed to the unfavourable  elements.  If\r\n\r\nthere  is no special care for these women after  they\r\n\r\nhave  given  birth, their health may be impaired  and\r\n\r\neven  their  lives may be endangered. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Minister has any plans  to  remedy  the\r\n\r\nsituation. I hope he will give an answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  allegations made by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai. I cannot agree more with  the  Member\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  important to ensure high  standards  of\r\n\r\ncourtesy  among  our  public  servants.  However,   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  there  has been an all-round improvement  in\r\n\r\nthis  respect.  In  a  large Ministry,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Health which has about 20,000  employees\r\n\r\napproximately  one-third of all Government  employees\r\n\r\nthere  are  bound  to  be complaints  against  a  few\r\n\r\nemployees now and then. Where details have been given\r\n\r\nin specific complaints, investigations have been made\r\n\r\nand  appropriate  action has been taken  against  the\r\n\r\noffenders.  I can assure Members that should  any  of\r\n\r\nthem   have  any  complaints  to  make,  these   will\r\n\r\ncertainly  be looked into. In fact, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth   will  be  extremely  grateful   to   receive\r\n\r\nauthenticated complaints. They must be  specific  and\r\n\r\nnot   general   or   vague,   so   that   appropriate\r\n\r\ndisciplinary action can be taken against  the  offend\r\n\r\ners.  By this means, the Ministry of Health hopes  to\r\n\r\nraise  the standard of efficiency and service of  its\r\n\r\nstaff to higher levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the question of cancer in women brought\r\n\r\nup  by the Member for Delta, I cannot agree with  her\r\n\r\nmore  that  cancer  is a major and grave  problem  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Unfortunately, medical experts would  tell\r\n\r\nus  that  the cancer research carried out up  to  the\r\n\r\npresent  has  not been able to tell us what  actually\r\n\r\ncauses  cancer. Perhaps the Member for Joo Chiat  can\r\n\r\nelaborate further on this. Therefore, as long as  the\r\n\r\nbasic cause of cancer is unknown, preventive measures\r\n\r\nwill, therefore, not be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we in the Health Ministry have been giving\r\n\r\na  screening service for detecting cancer in women in\r\n\r\nKandang   Kerbau  Hospital.  This  was   started   in\r\n\r\nSeptember  1964.  To  date there  are  three  doctors\r\n\r\nCytologists  and nine cytotechnicians providing  this\r\n\r\nservice in the Cytology Department of Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital. The staff are pooled together from  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau  Hospital an-d the Family Planning and  Popula\r\n\r\ntion  Board,  and screening smears from  patients  of\r\n\r\nKandang Kerbau Hospital an-d selected cases from  the\r\n\r\nFamily Planning and Population Board clinics are sent\r\n\r\nto the Cytology Unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I elaborate by giving Members some figures\r\n\r\nregarding the work of the Cytology Laboratory in Kan-\r\n\r\ndang  Kerbau Hospital. The number of smears  done  in\r\n\r\n1965 was 464. In 1966, it increased to 1,744. And  in\r\n\r\n1967, it reached the figure of 3,957. From the smears\r\n\r\nwhich  were  done, 42 confirmed cases were discovered\r\n\r\nin 1966. In 1967, 88 cases were discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The returns from the Cytology Laboratory of Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital concerning cases from the Family Plan\r\n\r\nning  and Population Board are as follows. The number\r\n\r\nof patients screened in 1967 was 5,713 and the number\r\n\r\nof confirmed cancer cases discovered was 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, it is not possible to screen all\r\n\r\npatients  attending  Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital  as  a\r\n\r\nroutine step, and only indicated patient screening is\r\n\r\npractised. This is not part of the programme  of  any\r\n\r\ncancer  research centre, although research pertaining\r\n\r\nto  obstetrical and gyncological problems is going on\r\n\r\nin  Kandang Kerbau Hospital. As the Member for  Delta\r\n\r\nhas  said, it is possible to effect a cure  in  early\r\n\r\ncases of cancer of the womb by excision surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point brought up by the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nconcerns  the  services rendered  by  Kandang  Kerbau\r\n\r\nHospital.  She  mentioned that there are  not  enough\r\n\r\nlabour  wards in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. Of  course,\r\n\r\nshe would like to know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat measures we are taking. I would say that, at the\r\n\r\nmoment,   the  Ministry  of  Health  is  starting   a\r\n\r\nMaternity  Unit in the Thomson Road General  Hospital\r\n\r\nin order to increase labour ward facilities. However,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  point out that the position  is  not  as\r\n\r\nserious  as  it was two or three years ago.  This  is\r\n\r\nlargely  due  to  the  fact that  there  has  been  a\r\n\r\nsubstantial decrease in our birth rate in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAs  a  result, the pressure on the use of the  labour\r\n\r\nwards  in  Kandang Kerbau Hospital has  substantially\r\n\r\ndecreased this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, with the assurance of\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Health that  he  is  prepared  to\r\n\r\nreceive all complaints, I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $58,472,820 for Head 1302 ordered to\r\n\r\nstand part of the Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1303 -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rodrigo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1303 be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on public health, I wish to express my\r\n\r\nappreciation of the Minister's enthusiasm in  wanting\r\n\r\nto  make Singapore a clean and healthy place for  all\r\n\r\nof us to live in and for our visitors to be delighted\r\n\r\nwith  the environment. We all want clean and  healthy\r\n\r\nsurroundings. Who does not? In order to achieve this,\r\n\r\nthe Minister will have to make laws. This is granted.\r\n\r\nLaws are necessary. This is all right. Such laws have\r\n\r\nbeen enacted and we have seen a lot of teeth in these\r\n\r\nlaws. For myself, I have even found some fangs.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  all right. I recall the Minister's statement\r\n\r\nearlier this year that he is determined to make  this\r\n\r\nplace  clean and healthy. By this time, I am  getting\r\n\r\nworried. My constituency is not a place which is that\r\n\r\nwell  off as first impressions seem to convey.  Seran\r\n\r\ngoon  Gardens appears to be a middle-class area. But,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  there are a lot of rural folk fringing  my\r\n\r\nconstituency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou   can   classify   them  as   poor   people.   My\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of the application of  these  laws  is\r\n\r\nthat  if  it  becomes necessary, they must inevitably\r\n\r\nfall  upon the poorer classes, because the conditions\r\n\r\nunder which they live are such that they attract  the\r\n\r\napplication of these laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n<br><br>6.53 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must state that I am mindful of the fact that the\r\n\r\nMinister   intends  to  apply  these   laws,   should\r\n\r\napplication  become necessary, only to incorrigibles.\r\n\r\nBut  then the conditions of living of poor people are\r\n\r\nnot  of  their  choice. When daily living  becomes  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of daily urgency, they do not tend to  attach\r\n\r\nmuch  importance to a little dirt around  the  place,\r\n\r\nbecause  these are conditions which obtain  daily  in\r\n\r\ntheir  lives.  My  fear is that they  can  be  easily\r\n\r\nclassified   as   incorrigibles   and   attract   the\r\n\r\napplication of these laws. Of course, this will  make\r\n\r\nthe  situation  much  worse and create  hardship  for\r\n\r\nthem.  The  point of this observation  is  purely  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Minister always to have this in  mind,\r\n\r\nthat laws of this sort usually apply to these classes\r\n\r\nof people, and to request that summonses for offences\r\n\r\nunder these laws be issued only when his Ministry  is\r\n\r\nreally satisfied that the recipients of summonses are\r\n\r\nreally incorrigibles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to raise concerns what I may\r\n\r\nterm  the  new  expose that is going on around  town,\r\n\r\nespecially  in the centre of our city. I notice  that\r\n\r\nthe  concrete  slabs which have all  this  time  been\r\n\r\ncovering  the  main  drains in  the  city  are  being\r\n\r\nremoved,  and permanently too. Of course, there  must\r\n\r\nbe a reason for this. My first reaction is to ask why\r\n\r\nwe  are exposing the bowels of our city to the public\r\n\r\nor  to  visitors  of  our fair city.  There  must  be\r\n\r\ncertain hazards that the Minister is trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nBut  if the Minister's fear is rats, I do not see why\r\n\r\nlarge  numbers of these slabs which cover the  drains\r\n\r\nought  to be removed permanently. I still think  that\r\n\r\nif his Ministry wishes to go on regular sprees of rat\r\n\r\nextermination, they can still do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\nso  without  permanently  removing  these  slabs.  My\r\n\r\nsimple  understanding  of city development,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthat the drains in the city are covered. I think this\r\n\r\nis  the  development in large cities  in  progressive\r\n\r\ncountries. Here we have a reverse situation where  we\r\n\r\nare exposing the subterranean affairs of our city  to\r\n\r\npublic view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that I wish to raise is a matter\r\n\r\nwhich  concerns my constituency - Serangoon  Gardens.\r\n\r\nWe  have a market called Serangoon Gardens Market. To\r\n\r\ndate,  I  have discovered that there are 51 vacancies\r\n\r\nin  the  market. For some obscure reason, the Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment in the Public Health Division has  refused\r\n\r\nto  issue licences for these vacancies. I do not know\r\n\r\nwhether   they  are  awaiting  what   is   called   a\r\n\r\nconstituency-to-constituency registration of  hawkers\r\n\r\nin  markets.  I will be much obliged if the  Minister\r\n\r\ncan enlighten me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, during the debate on the\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Public Health Bill, I put a question to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister which was not answered. I think we were\r\n\r\ngetting on rather late that evening and it must  have\r\n\r\nescaped his attention. My question is on the disposal\r\n\r\nof  rubbish in the rural areas. I was just  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether   any  plan  has  been  drawn  up   in   this\r\n\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first,\r\n\r\nI  would like to touch upon the first point which the\r\n\r\nMember  for Serangoon Gardens has made. He said  that\r\n\r\nthe  burden  of the application of the public  health\r\n\r\nlaw  that  we have passed- would mainly fall  on  the\r\n\r\npoor people. Being a lawyer, the Member for Serangoon\r\n\r\nGardens should know that every person is equal before\r\n\r\nthe  law whether he is poor or rich, a big towkay  or\r\n\r\njust an ordinary workman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to bring up in reply to\r\n\r\nhis  statement is that it does not mean that the poor\r\n\r\npeople are dirty and the rich people are clean. As  a\r\n\r\nmatter of fact, poor people who live in a humble  hut\r\n\r\ncan  be  very clean. In my coilstituency tours during\r\n\r\nthe \"Keep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore Clean\" campaign, I saw people who  live  in\r\n\r\nhumble  huts keep their places very, very  clean.  On\r\n\r\nthe  other  hand, I passed big compound  houses  with\r\n\r\nMercedes  cars  parked inside and I found  that  they\r\n\r\nwere quite dirty. It is not true that poor people are\r\n\r\ndirty  or will have dirt around their houses.  I  say\r\n\r\nthat cleanliness is something which should be pursued\r\n\r\nby everybody, whether he is rich or poor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to bring up is in\r\n\r\nreply  to the Member for Serangoon Gardens who wanted\r\n\r\nto   know  why  the  Ministry  of  Health  has   been\r\n\r\nunslabbing  the drains. The answer is quite  obvious.\r\n\r\nWe  have  done  so as a health measure to  facilitate\r\n\r\npublic  cleansing,  prevent  choking  of  drains  and\r\n\r\nreduce  mosquito breeding. The mosquito nuisance  has\r\n\r\nbeen  in  existence in Singapore for many years,  but\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  increase and  rapid  tempo  of  urban\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and the extensive covering  of  roadside\r\n\r\ndrains, especially in the more congested areas in the\r\n\r\ncity,  the preponderance of mosquito complaints  from\r\n\r\n1958  onwards has emphasised the mounting seriousness\r\n\r\nof the urban mosquito problem. There has also been  a\r\n\r\ncorresponding increase in mosquito-borne diseases  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially over the last six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey of the breeding habitat of nuisance\r\n\r\nmosquitoes showed that out of a sample of 2,852 areas\r\n\r\nin  which these mosquitoes were found breeding,  over\r\n\r\n60  per  cent of such breeding was found in  concrete\r\n\r\ndrains  and  culverts. There is no doubt that  drains\r\n\r\nare   the   favourite  habitat  of   these   nuisance\r\n\r\nmosquitoes,  and  where such drains are  choked  with\r\n\r\nrefuse  and  have  stagnant pools of water,  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding  is  usually prolific. It therefore  follows\r\n\r\nthat  regular and thorough public cleansing  work  to\r\n\r\ndig  up  and remove the refuse, debris and silt  from\r\n\r\nthe  drains,  to  clear  choked  -drains,  drain  off\r\n\r\nstagnant  pools  of water to ensure  an  unobstructed\r\n\r\nflow  of  water in these drains, will  be  a  primary\r\n\r\nrequirement in the prevention\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  mosquito breeding in the drains. For  such  drain\r\n\r\ncleansing work to be effectively carried- out,  there\r\n\r\nhas  to  be unimpeded access to all sections of  open\r\n\r\ndrains  for the public cleansing worker to  get  into\r\n\r\nand  to  work  in. Concrete slabs on the drains  will\r\n\r\ndeny  access  to  the drains and will accordingly  be\r\n\r\nphysically   obstructing  and  impeding   this   very\r\n\r\nnecessary  and routine cleansing work.  As  a  public\r\n\r\nhealth  requirement, drains should therefore  not  be\r\n\r\ncovered  and  where -drains have been  slabbed  over,\r\n\r\nthen  such covered- slabs should, as far as possible,\r\n\r\nbe removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens said that we should\r\n\r\nnot expose the drains to the view of visitors. If  we\r\n\r\nwant a system of closed drains, then there must be  a\r\n\r\nsystem of sewers as they have in other countries. But\r\n\r\nin  Singapore we do not have such a system.  We  have\r\n\r\nonly a system of monsoon drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point which was brought up by the Member\r\n\r\nfor Serangoon Gardens concerns vacancies existing  in\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens Market. At the moment, there are 50\r\n\r\nvacant  stalls  in the market for which  applications\r\n\r\nwill  be  open  as  soon  as the  island-wide  hawker\r\n\r\nsurvey,  which  was launched on the 2nd  of  December\r\n\r\nthis  year,  is  completed. It is expected  that  the\r\n\r\nsurvey,  when  completed around the  end  of  January\r\n\r\n1969,  will give us an accurate picture of  how  many\r\n\r\nlicensed and unlicensed hawkers in approved sites  or\r\n\r\notherwise  are conducting their business.  With  such\r\n\r\ninformation, it will be possible for us to  plan  and\r\n\r\nsuitably allocate stalls to the hawkers in the  order\r\n\r\nof priority as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) licensed hawkers in the vicinity;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) registered unlicensed hawkers in the\r\n\r\nvicinity; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) other hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, to allocate any of th-e stalls before the survey is over would lead to difficulties later on, as more deserving hawkers are likely to be left out.

There is a hawker\r\n\r\ncongregation at Old Kallang Airport Estate.  Although\r\n\r\n107  unlicensed  roadside  hawkers  were  resited  at\r\n\r\nGuillemard Road Market in October this year,  only  a\r\n\r\nfew  cooked-food hawkers have taken up their allotted\r\n\r\npitches  in  this market, whereas the  other  market-\r\n\r\nproduce  hawkers  who  sell vegetables,  meat,  pork,\r\n\r\netc., have so far not taken up the stalls allotted to\r\n\r\nthem  in Guillemard Road Market except the two exist\r\n\r\ning  stall-holders. Prior to the  resiting of these\r\n\r\nhawkers,  this market was occupied by only these two\r\n\r\nexisting  stall-holders who actually used the market\r\n\r\nas  their transit stalls. There are 34 stalls in this\r\n\r\nmarket  and 32 of them have been left vacant for,  as\r\n\r\nfar as I know, about eight to nine years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the resiting took place, the majority of these\r\n\r\nhawkers,   who  now  possess  licences,  have   again\r\n\r\nresorted to illegal hawking on the Estate's roads  or\r\n\r\ncar  parks from where they were earlier cleared. Some\r\n\r\nof  them  have  migrated  to other  housing  estates.\r\n\r\nDuring  the  \"Keep  Singapore  Clean\"  campaign   the\r\n\r\nMinister for Health toured the market and he knew the\r\n\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, you may wish to know why\r\n\r\nthese  hawkers have refused to take up their allotted \r\n\r\nstalls and pitches in and around Guillemard  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad  Market.  This  market, which  is  an  open-shed\r\n\r\nstructure  and  can accommodate only 34  stalls  (not\r\n\r\ncounting  the pitches outside it), was built probably\r\n\r\nin  1953  or  1954 after the completion of  the  low-\r\n\r\nterrace  houses around Guillemard Road  by  the  then\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust. These low-terrace houses\r\n\r\nwere  used to rehouse the families from the clearance\r\n\r\nsite  at  Beach Road to make way for the erection  of\r\n\r\nMerdeka  Bridge.  Later in 1958, when  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nImprovement  Trust developed the Old Kallang  Airport\r\n\r\nEstate  which  is  adjacent to  the  Guillemard  Road\r\n\r\nEstate,  another standard market, now  known  as  Old\r\n\r\nAirport  Road  Market, was also built. When  the  Old\r\n\r\nAirport  Road Market was completed, hawkers began  to\r\n\r\ndesert  Guillemard Road Market. Some of  the  hawkers\r\n\r\ntook  up stalls at the Old Airport Road Market  while\r\n\r\nothers  who  were not so successful took  to  hawking\r\n\r\nalong  the  roadsides  around the  Old  Airport  Road\r\n\r\nMarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not very optimistic about the success of\r\n\r\nany future attempt to offer the stalls and pitches at\r\n\r\nGuillemard  Road Mark-et to hawkers,  nor  will  they\r\n\r\nhave  any  confidence  in a  market  which  was  once\r\n\r\ndeserted for eight to nine years. I do not understand\r\n\r\nwhy the Hawkers Department has allowed this state  of\r\n\r\naffairs to go on for such a long time. It reflects on\r\n\r\nits efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was approached by the Hawkers Department in\r\n\r\nJuly  1967  on the problem of the hawker congregation\r\n\r\nat Old Kallang Airport Estate, I gave my comments and\r\n\r\nsome  suggestions  on  how to resite  the  unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers,  but  resiting  was not  carried  out  until\r\n\r\nOctober  this year. The congregation of  hawkers  was\r\n\r\nallowed  to  continue unchecked.  It  was  not  until\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year, when the powers  to  tackle  the\r\n\r\nhawker  problem were transferred to the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, that some action was  taken.  The\r\n\r\nhawkers were harassed and cleared. But harassing  and\r\n\r\nclearing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalone are not the solution to the problem. After some\r\n\r\npersuasion,  these unlicensed hawkers  agreed  to  be\r\n\r\nresited  at  Guillemard Road Market for a  period  of\r\n\r\nthree  to  four  months. When the  survey  of  vacant\r\n\r\nstalls  and pitches in and around Old Airport  Market\r\n\r\nhas  been completed, they have been promised priority\r\n\r\nin the consideration of stalls and pitches at the Old\r\n\r\nAirport  Market when these vacancies are thrown  open\r\n\r\nfor application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, may I ask the Minister a few\r\n\r\nquestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has the survey for vacant stalls and pitches\r\n\r\nin and around\r\n\r\nthe Old Airport Market been finalised, and,  if\r\n\r\nso, are they ready for application?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Are there any previous applications from\r\n\r\nresidents  of  the Old Kallang Airport  Estate,\r\n\r\nand,   if   so,  will  these  applications   be\r\n\r\nentertained?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Will additional hawking lots be provided at\r\n\r\nthe  surrounding concourse of the  Old  Kallang\r\n\r\nAirport  Market to accommodate and resite  more\r\n\r\nunlicensed hawkers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I  sincerely  hope that the Minister for Health  will\r\n\r\ngive  satisfactory answers to the  questions  I  have\r\n\r\njust raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now wish to touch on Guillemard Road Market.\r\n\r\nI  have  just  mentioned that any future  attempt  to\r\n\r\noffer stalls and pitches at this market to unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers  will again be a failure because  hawkers  do\r\n\r\nnot have any confidence in this market. There will be\r\n\r\nno  business  in  this market as  a  standard-, size\r\n\r\nmarket, i.e., the Old Kallang Airport Market, is just\r\n\r\nless  than  200 yards away. Although these unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers took out licences for their ballotted  stalls\r\n\r\nand  pitches,  so far only a few cooked-food  hawkers\r\n\r\nare  doing their hawking trade there. They  have  com\r\n\r\nplained of poor business and sometimes no business at\r\n\r\nall. I doubt very much if\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  unlicensed hawkers will accept any  stalls  or\r\n\r\npitches in this market that are offered to them. This\r\n\r\nbeing  the  case, I suggest to the Minister  that  he\r\n\r\naccept  a  proposal  to convert this  market  into  a\r\n\r\nrecreational  hall for the benefit of the  residents.\r\n\r\nThis  at least will serve some useful purpose instead\r\n\r\nof  allowing the market to be deserted again. In this\r\n\r\ncase,  the People's Association can be asked to  take\r\n\r\nover  this  market and develop it as  a  recreational\r\n\r\ncentre particularly for the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.18 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also find out from the Minister for Health\r\n\r\nwhether the Government or the Housing and Development\r\n\r\nBoard has any plan to build a hawkers' centre in  the\r\n\r\nOld  Kallang Airport Estate to accommodate unlicensed\r\n\r\nhawkers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  a month ago, the Hawkers Department of the  Min\r\n\r\nistry    of   Health   carried   out   an   extensive\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into the conditions and  licensing  of\r\n\r\nhawkers  and  the  problems-relating  thereto.  Human\r\n\r\nbeings  are  very emotional and sensitive. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe    hawkers   are   rather   worried   about   the\r\n\r\ninvestigation.  There  is a  Chinese  saying  to  the\r\n\r\neffect that when a dog raises its rear leg, it is  an\r\n\r\nindication  that  it wants to ease itself.  In  other\r\n\r\nwords, certain signs foretell what is coming. In  the\r\n\r\nsame  way,  the  hawkers have certain misgivings  and\r\n\r\nsuspicions.  They wonder what is behind the  move  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  their  conditions.  They  know  that  un\r\n\r\nlicensed  hawkers are not allowed to  hawk  and  that\r\n\r\nnormally  hawkers  should  have  licences.  So   they\r\n\r\nsuspect  that there is something cooking because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is carrying out a full-scale investigation\r\n\r\ninto  the  conditions of hawkers. There is talk  that\r\n\r\nhawkers may lose their licences because they  are  an\r\n\r\neyesore in the context of Singapore as a garden  city\r\n\r\nand  of the environmental public health measures that\r\n\r\nare  being taken. This is what the hawkers - especially\r\n\r\nthose who are non-citizens -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare worried about. I hope the Minister will inform us\r\n\r\nof  the  purpose of the survey that is being  carried\r\n\r\nout  into the conditions of hawkers so that they need\r\n\r\nnot be worried about their-future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that is worrying them is that it is\r\n\r\npossible that hawkers holding blue identity cards may\r\n\r\nhave  their  licences revoked. I hope this  will  not\r\n\r\nmaterialise as hawkers with blue identity cards  are,\r\n\r\nafter  all,  long  residents  of  Singapore.  I  have\r\n\r\ntouched  on  this point some time ago in this  House.\r\n\r\nThese  hawkers with blue identity cards are not  able\r\n\r\nto  obtain  Singapore citizenship although they  have\r\n\r\napplied for it. So they have no other alternative but\r\n\r\nto resort to hawking for a living. It is not possible\r\n\r\nfor  aliens  who  do not even possess  blue  identity\r\n\r\ncards to hawk in our city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister answer two questions: one, what is\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of the investigation into the conditions\r\n\r\nof  hawkers? two, what is the policy with  regard  to\r\n\r\nhawkers  who  possess blue identity  cards  and  will\r\n\r\nthese  cards be taken away from them if they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave hawking licences?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will reply\r\n\r\nfirst to the Member for Mountbatten. He spoke on  the\r\n\r\nunpopularity of Guillemard Road Market. According  to\r\n\r\nhim,  only a few hawkers who have been resited  there\r\n\r\nare still in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guillemard Road Market was built in 1955 at a cost\r\n\r\nof  about  $18,000. It was so built that it would  be\r\n\r\nconvenient  to  all householders in the  vicinity  as\r\n\r\nthey  would not have to travel very far to  do  their\r\n\r\nmarketing. For some reason or other, this  market  is\r\n\r\noccupied  by only 25 licensed hawkers although  there\r\n\r\nis  room, for a total of 109, and 102 licences have.~\r\n\r\nin  fact, been issued. As it is physically impossible\r\n\r\nfor  25  licensed hawkers ~o cater for the  marketing\r\n\r\nrequirement$  of  the people in the vicinity,  it  is\r\n\r\ninevitabIe  that  they  will rather  go  to  the  Old\r\n\r\nKallang Airport Market to do their marketing as every\r\n\r\nmarketing  item can be purchased there. This  has  re\r\n\r\nsulted in less patronage of Guillemard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoad  Market  and, therefore, it is  unpopular.  This\r\n\r\nstate  of  affairs  can fairly be attributed  to  the\r\n\r\nhawkers  themselves. It is a vicious  circle.  Unless\r\n\r\nall  the hawkers who have been allotted pitches there\r\n\r\ngo  and  occupy them so that a person  who  wants  to\r\n\r\npurchase a list of items can do so in that market, it\r\n\r\nwill  not be desirable for the people in the vicinity\r\n\r\nto  make  their purchases there. Therefore, it  is  a\r\n\r\nvicious  circle.  The fault lies  squarely  with  the\r\n\r\nhawkers themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the building of markets which are\r\n\r\nrejected  by  the hawkers. The Member for Mountbatten\r\n\r\nhas  suggested that such markets can be converted for\r\n\r\nsome  other  useful  purpose. Land  in  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nscarce. The conversion into recreational halls of mar\r\n\r\nkets which are sited and specially selected for their\r\n\r\ncentral  location  will be a sheer  waste  of  public\r\n\r\nfunds.  Once the hawkers' survey is over, all  vacant\r\n\r\npitches in all markets will be filled and each market\r\n\r\nwill  cater  for  almost every type  and  variety  of\r\n\r\nmarket  produce. Those who do not take this excellent\r\n\r\nopportunity  of  occupying stalls in the  market  but\r\n\r\npersist  in illegally occupying sites outside  it  or\r\n\r\noccupying unauthorised pitches will be prosecuted. It\r\n\r\nis,  therefore,  the intention of the Ministry  event\r\n\r\nually  to  have  all the hawkers in  Singapore  trade\r\n\r\nwithin  premises, otherwise Singapore  cannot  become\r\n\r\nthe  clean  and green garden city that it should  be.\r\n\r\nFurther,  it is ridiculous and unfair for the  stall-\r\n\r\nholders  in markets to pay licence fees if  we  allow\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers to hawk outside  the  market  and\r\n\r\nsteal away the business of those inside the markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I for one will admit that the hawker problem is a most difficult one. But we must be realistic and practical in tackling it. We must look at the long-term interest of the community as well as of the hawkers themselves. In order to attain these objectives, we have unfortunately to carry out\r\n\r\nunpopular measures. To quote a good example, when the\r\n\r\nHawkers  Department in the Ministry of Health  wanted\r\n\r\nto clear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  hawkers  in  the Koek Road  area  and  get  them\r\n\r\nresited  at  the Orchard Road Car Park, all  of  them\r\n\r\nprotested.  Some  of them alleged  that  the  Hawkers\r\n\r\nDepartment  was  trying to take away their  rice-bowl\r\n\r\nand  that they could only \"catch mosquitoes\" -in  the\r\n\r\nOrchard  Road Car Park. As Members know, the  Orchard\r\n\r\nRoad  Car Park is now the most popular hawker  centre\r\n\r\nin the whole of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take unpopular measures at the moment.\r\n\r\nSome of the hawkers are perhaps short-sighted and  do\r\n\r\nnot  see the advantages of what we propose to do, and\r\n\r\ninvariably  they  oppose  us  at  first.  But,  again\r\n\r\nquoting the case of the Orchard Road Car Park,  I  am\r\n\r\ntold that not only are the Koek Road hawkers who were\r\n\r\nresited  at  the Orchard Road Car Park happy  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  making a lot of money, but there are  many\r\n\r\nother  hawkers also who are trying to get pitches  in\r\n\r\nthe Orchard Road Car Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we in the Health Ministry, perhaps unlike some Members, are quite prepared to take unpopular measures to protect the long-term interests of the community as well as the hawkers. We are not out for praise or popularity. We are not in this political business for personal gain.. If we know\r\n\r\nthat what we do is right, we will do it. We prefer to\r\n\r\nbe  cursed now and praised later, rather than  to  be\r\n\r\npraised  now  and cursed for the rest of  our  lives.\r\n\r\nAfter the hawkers' survey, we shall work out a scheme\r\n\r\nin  which  all  hawkers  will be  resited  in  proper\r\n\r\npremises.  I cannot say that we can do so  overnight.\r\n\r\nIt  will take some time. But we are determined to  do\r\n\r\nwhat is right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten brought up the question\r\n\r\nof  the  Old Kallang Airport Market and asked whether\r\n\r\nthere are any vacancies there and what plans we  have\r\n\r\nto fill the vacancies now existing. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe survey of the Old Kallang Airport Market has been\r\n\r\ncompleted. It has been ascertained\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the following number of stalls are available:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) inside the market, 38 stalls;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) covered pitches outside the market, 115 day\r\n\r\nstalls and 194 night stalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the resiting exercise will not,\r\n\r\nhowever,  take  place  until the  island-wide  hawker\r\n\r\nsurvey,   which   commenced  on  2nd   December,   is\r\n\r\ncompleted.  It will be around the end of  January  or\r\n\r\nmiddle  of January next year, depending on  how  fast\r\n\r\nprogress  is  made. It is expected that the  resiting\r\n\r\nexercise in respect of this market will take place in\r\n\r\nthe latter half of February 1969..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other question is, how do we intend to allocate\r\n\r\nthese  vacant pitches? They are as follows, in  order\r\n\r\nof priority:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Licensed hawkers in Guillemard Road and Old Kallang Airport Markets;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Registered licensed hawkers in the vicinity;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Other applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I would like to point out, particularly to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Mountbatten, that it is advisable for those  who\r\n\r\napplied  for these pitches years ago to apply  again,\r\n\r\nas some records were destroyed in the fire which took\r\n\r\nplace in the Hawkers Department some years ago.  This\r\n\r\nis  to  make  doubly  sure that their  names  are  on\r\n\r\nrecord.  The  other point is whether the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board intends to build another market  in\r\n\r\nthe  Old  Kallang Airport Estate. I cannot speak  for\r\n\r\nthe  Housing and Development Board. But I would  like\r\n\r\nto  say that unless vacancies in the existing markets\r\n\r\nare  filled, I do not think it is justified  to  have\r\n\r\nanother market built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the observations made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Delta. She raised the question of what we intend\r\n\r\nto  do after we have completed the island-wide survey\r\n\r\nof  hawkers, and expressed certain misgivings on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  hawkers at large. She said that  they  were\r\n\r\nsuspicious  of  our intentions and would,  therefore,\r\n\r\nlike to have a categorical statement from the Health\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  our intentions. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nanswer  is quite simple. As a matter of fact,  before\r\n\r\nthe  island-wide survey of hawkers commenced, a press\r\n\r\nstatement   was   issued.  It  clearly   stated   our\r\n\r\nintentions.  I  do  not think  there  should  be  any\r\n\r\njustification  for any suspicions of our  intentions.\r\n\r\nIf  I  may  quote certain paragraphs from  the  press\r\n\r\nstatement  which  was issued just before  the  survey\r\n\r\ncommenced. These are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The long-term solution to the hawker problem can be\r\n\r\nachieved  if  hawkers  accept that  it  is  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest  to trade in proper licensed premises,  such\r\n\r\nas  markets,  shop-houses and indoor hawker  centres,\r\n\r\nwhich  have essential facilities such as pipe  water,\r\n\r\nelectricity and other sanitary facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health, in close liaison with the\r\n\r\nMinistry of National Development\r\n\r\nand  the  Housing and Development Board, have decided\r\n\r\nto tackle the problem jointly in an effort to find  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  solution  to  the  problem.  One   primary\r\n\r\nobjective  is  to ensure the provision of  reasonably\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  indoor  or  covered  accommodation   to\r\n\r\nreplace  present  hawker sites in streets  and  back-\r\n\r\nlanes. However, to what extent such facilities should\r\n\r\nbe  provided and where they should be located  cannot\r\n\r\nbe   accurately  planned  ahead  unless  an  accurate\r\n\r\ncensorship of hawkers is taken.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our intentions are clearly stated here.\r\n\r\nI  do not think there should be any suspicions of our intentions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point brought up by the Member for Delta was in\r\n\r\nregard to non-citizens who apply for  hawker\r\n\r\nlicences. The policy on this has been laid down  with\r\n\r\ngreat  care  to  protect the rights  and  welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens. Hawker licences for non-citizens\r\n\r\nalready in possession of them are being renewed on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  basis,  that  is,  from  month  to  month,\r\n\r\nprovided  they hawk at authorised sites. This  refers\r\n\r\nprimarily  to  holders  of blue  identity  cards,  as\r\n\r\napplications for the renewal of licences of those not\r\n\r\nin  possession of blue identity cards or with foreign\r\n\r\npassports  are  rejected outright. Moreover,  a  non-\r\n\r\ncitizen  hawker  may transfer his or her  licence  to\r\n\r\nanother member of his or her family if that member of\r\n\r\nthe family is a Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizen  and is unemployed. The Government cannot  in\r\n\r\nthe public interest allow fresh applications from non-\r\n\r\ncitizen hawkers, even those with blue identity cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Singapore is a young country. Because of her beauty, progress and cleanliness, she has succeeded in attracting tourists. Nevertheless, there are some shortcomings in the rural areas. A few months ago the Health Ministry organised a \"Keep Singapore Clean\" campaign.\r\n\r\nIt  received  an overwhelming response and  full  co-\r\n\r\noperation   from   the  masses.  This   proves   that\r\n\r\ncleanliness is accepted by the people as an every-day\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Hence  the  success  of  the   \"Keep\r\n\r\nSingapore  Clean\"  campaign.  However,  a  state   of\r\n\r\ncleanliness cannot be achieved if we depend solely on\r\n\r\nmembers  of the public to maintain it. The  staff  of\r\n\r\nthe  Cleansing  Department have failed  to  discharge\r\n\r\ntheir duty on the grounds that there is a shortage of\r\n\r\ngarbage  vans and manpower. As a result, many  places\r\n\r\nhave  not been thoroughly cleaned. Rubbish heaps have\r\n\r\nnot  been removed. It is, therefore, unfair to charge\r\n\r\nthe  people  with  neglecting to observe  cleanliness\r\n\r\nwhen,  in  fact, the machinery for keeping  Singapore\r\n\r\nclean  originates  with  the Health  Department.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  for  Health has seen fit to  prosecute  and\r\n\r\nfine  only  members  of  the public  for  failure  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  cleanliness. But it has  not  taken  action\r\n\r\nagainst the staff of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Ministry for their negligence and sluggishness\r\n\r\nin  the execution of their duties. Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  equivalent  to the Malay  saying,  \"A  crab\r\n\r\ninstructing its young to walk straight.\" I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Health will note this and take remedial\r\n\r\nmeasures to improve the existing state of affairs  in\r\n\r\nthe Health Department\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Geylang Serai, I must  say  that  in\r\n\r\nGeylang  Serai  Constituency, 30 additional  premises\r\n\r\nhave  been  taken over by the Katong District  Office\r\n\r\nand have given service since the new Local Government\r\n\r\nConservancy  Regulations were brought into  force  in\r\n\r\nJuly this year. It has to be admitted that during the\r\n\r\nyear,  there  have  been times  when  difficulty  was\r\n\r\nexperienced in refuse collection caused partly by the\r\n\r\nbreakdown  of vehicles and partly by the shortage  of\r\n\r\nwagons.   Some  of  these  difficulties   have   been\r\n\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I enumerate the figures of refuse removed\r\n\r\nand   the  productivity  of  labour  for  the  Katong\r\n\r\nDistrict, it will definitely prove to this House that\r\n\r\nsince  the  middle of this year, an effort  has  been\r\n\r\nmade  by  the  workers of the Ministry of  Health  to\r\n\r\nincrease  productivity. This will disprove  what  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Geylang Serai has said, that the  Health\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  not putting enough effort  into  making\r\n\r\nSingapore  one  of the cleanest cities  in  Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia.

A case  has\r\n\r\nbeen made to the Ministry of Finance for the purchase\r\n\r\nof   148   new  refuse  collection  vehicles  costing\r\n\r\napproximately  $4 million over the  next  two  years,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  1969 and 1970. Some of these vehicles will  be\r\n\r\nfor  the  Katong District and will lead  to  improved\r\n\r\nservices. The Katong District includes Geylang  Serai\r\n\r\nConstituency.  In  the meantime, hired  lorries  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if there are any specific complaints\r\n\r\nagainst  workers who neglect their  duty  or  do  not\r\n\r\nwork, these will be investigated and firm action will\r\n\r\nbe taken. Since the Operations Room was set up on 1st\r\n\r\nOctober,  1968,  there have been only two  complaints\r\n\r\napplicable  to the two sectors within which  the  con\r\n\r\nstituency  lies.

Hence such statistical data and useful\r\n\r\naggregates such as the gross domestic expenditure are\r\n\r\nnot  available  for  the Budget sitting  which  takes\r\n\r\nplace in November or December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In presenting the Annual Budget, a review of the\r\n\r\nstate  of  the  economy  for  which  these  data  are\r\n\r\nessential  would  be  better made  if  the  year  for\r\n\r\nbudgetary purposes be changed to close at 31st\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch  of each year and that this be introduced  from\r\n\r\nthe  next financial year which will then extend  from\r\n\r\n1st  January, 1969, to 31st March, 1970.  Our  Budget\r\n\r\nsitting can then take place in March each year.  This\r\n\r\nwill  give  us  January  and February  to  study  the\r\n\r\nstatistical data of the previous calendar year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has been taken to clarify the power\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister  in  respect of  the  write-off  of\r\n\r\nredundant  stores. Although section  19  (a)  of  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Procedure Act, 1966, enables the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance  to  write  off  the  value  of   lost,\r\n\r\ndeficient,   condemned,  unserviceable  or   obsolete\r\n\r\npublic  stores, it does not provide for the  disposal\r\n\r\nof  stores  on  the ground that they  are  no  longer\r\n\r\nrequired   for  the  purpose  for  which  they   were\r\n\r\noriginally purchased. Clause 3 of the Bill  seeks  to\r\n\r\nremedy this defect and to make clear the power of the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance in respect of the write-off  of\r\n\r\nredundant public stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to\r\n\r\na Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.-[MrTang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.
