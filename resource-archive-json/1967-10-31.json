And,  in  fact,  there  is  a  Facilitations\r\n\r\nCommittee which consists of my officials as well as\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the  airlines  which   meets\r\n\r\nfrequently  to discuss what measures  we  ought  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  at the Singapore Airport that will  make\r\n\r\ncommercial operations viable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The I.C.A., or the International Civil Aviation\r\n\r\norganisation,  of  which  Singapore  is  a  member,\r\n\r\nprescribes  standards regarding airport operations.\r\n\r\nThey    include   air   traffic   control,    radio\r\n\r\ncommunications, air navigational and landing heads,\r\n\r\nfire  and rescue services, meteorological and other\r\n\r\naeronautical  information  services.  As   far   as\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned, we have complied  with  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  standards, and the Member no  doubt  is\r\n\r\nreferring to a newspaper article published sometime\r\n\r\nago in which criticism was directed at all airports\r\n\r\nin Asia, excepting Hongkong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind Members of the House that\r\n\r\nthe   approach  to  Singapore  is  free  of   hilly\r\n\r\nobstructions; neither do we suffer the disadvantage\r\n\r\nof  having fog which interferes with the vision  of\r\n\r\npilots. Because we do not have these disadvantages,\r\n\r\nwe  must,  therefore,  use  our  common  sense  and\r\n\r\ndiscretion in equipping Singapore Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might mention that once upon a time Singapore\r\n\r\nhad housing by-laws which were taken wholesale from\r\n\r\nthe  United Kingdom building by-laws when Singapore\r\n\r\nwas   under  colonial  administration.  One  by-law\r\n\r\ninsisted that the roofs of houses in Singapore must\r\n\r\nbe built at an angle of 60\u00b0 so that when snow falls\r\n\r\nthe  snow will slide off the roof. It was  only  in\r\n\r\nrecent years that we removed this by-law as it  was\r\n\r\npatently  obvious  that  snow  does  not  fall   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral that I would like to draw is that it\r\n\r\nwould  be foolish for us to insist on, or  to  have\r\n\r\nimposed upon us, the facilities and standards which\r\n\r\nare  required only in those airports which face the\r\n\r\nperennial problem of fog or hazardous approach  due\r\n\r\nto obstruction by hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NON-CITIZENS IN CIVIL SERVICE ELIGIBLE FOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd.

This\r\n\r\nworks out to 0.18 per cent of the total income  tax\r\n\r\ncollected during that year.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) I am not aware that the present income tax\r\n\r\nassessments  of foreign artistes and  the  mode  of\r\n\r\ncollection   are  discouraging  talented   overseas\r\n\r\nmusicians,  dancers and actors from  performing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. In 1965 there were 381 foreign artistes.\r\n\r\nIn  1966  the number increased to 636, i.e.,  there\r\n\r\nwas an increase of 67 per cent; and in the first  9\r\n\r\nmonths of 1967 Singapore had 666 foreign artistes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system of collection is basically similar to\r\n\r\nthat  used by income tax authorities all  over  the\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) I agree that the performance of talented\r\n\r\nartistes  can be a means of fostering the  progress\r\n\r\nof   the  performing  arts  in  Singapore.  Foreign\r\n\r\nartistes whose visits are financed by public  funds\r\n\r\nof   another  country  are  exempt  from  tax.  All\r\n\r\nartistes   are  given  reasonable  allowances   for\r\n\r\nexpenses  as laid down in the law. These allowances\r\n\r\ninclude expenditure on make-up, hair-dos, costumes,\r\n\r\nlaundry,  accommodation, travel, and so  on.  Where\r\n\r\nthe  artistes are on a circuit, stopping  at  other\r\n\r\nplaces  than  Singapore, only a  portion  of  their\r\n\r\npassage    expenditure   attributable   to    their\r\n\r\nperformance in Singapore is allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence to suggest, and I am not\r\n\r\nconvinced, that income tax is the crucial factor in\r\n\r\ndetermining   the   number  of   foreign   artistes\r\n\r\nperforming in Singapore. However, a Bill  is  being\r\n\r\nintroduced to reduce the rate of income tax payable\r\n\r\nby non-residents deriving income from employment in\r\n\r\nSingapore, from 40 per cent to 15 per cent.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  quota  on matches  was  immediately\r\n\r\nliberalised in December last year from one per cent\r\n\r\nof  1964  imports to 75 per cent when it was  found\r\n\r\nthat there was a shortage of this commodity in  the\r\n\r\nmarket.  There  were  many  other  occasions   when\r\n\r\nsimilar  action was taken. The quota  on  builders'\r\n\r\nhardware was completely removed in March this  year\r\n\r\nwhen  it  became clear that the local  factory  was\r\n\r\ngoing to shut down because of various difficulties.\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle East crisis some time this  year,\r\n\r\nquota restrictions on a number of commodities, such\r\n\r\nas  electrodes, cables, galvanised wire and calcium\r\n\r\ncarbide,  were  immediately lifted to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nimporters had sufficient stocks to meet demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, where there is evidence that a local\r\n\r\nmanufacturer  is  trying to  exploit  consumers  by\r\n\r\neither   arbitrarily  increasing   prices   or   by\r\n\r\ndeliberately  reducing  production  to  create   an\r\n\r\nartificial   shortage   of  a   commodity,   import\r\n\r\nrestrictions  have also been relaxed. Undergarments\r\n\r\nare  a  case in point. It was discovered  that  the\r\n\r\nprice of imported garments had been increased,  but\r\n\r\nthe  local factory did not increase its production.\r\n\r\nSimilarly  the  quota on wire nails  was  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  10  per cent of 1963 imports to 50  per  cent\r\n\r\nearly  this  year  when  the  two  local  factories\r\n\r\narbitrarily increased their prices.

For\r\n\r\nthe  12-month  period  ending July  1967,  external\r\n\r\ntrade  totalled $7,783.3 million which exceeds  the\r\n\r\nvolume of trade in 1959, a record year. In the last\r\n\r\n12  months, i.e., August 1966 to July 1967, imports\r\n\r\nhave  increased by 9.7 per cent and exports by 10.8\r\n\r\nper  cent  over the similar period August  1965  to\r\n\r\nJuly  1966. Prospects are therefore very good  that\r\n\r\n1967 will register the highest ever volume of trade\r\n\r\ndone in the history of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the increase in trade is the amount of\r\n\r\ncargo loaded and discharged in Singapore. Thus  for\r\n\r\nthe  12-month  period ending in  July  1967,  cargo\r\n\r\ndischarged  amounted to 17.9 million freight  tons.\r\n\r\nCargo  loaded was 11.4 million freight tons,  which\r\n\r\nexceeds the annual volume of cargo handled  in  the\r\n\r\npast  eight  years.

It has also decided  to  merge  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  division of Southern  Islands  with  the\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions of Jurong, Pasir  Panjang  and\r\n\r\nTelok  Blangah.  The number of electoral  divisions\r\n\r\nwill be increased from the present 51 to 58.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Parliament Elections Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter  53) provides that each electoral division\r\n\r\nshall return one member to serve in Parliament. The\r\n\r\nConstitution    of    Singapore    stipulates     a\r\n\r\nParliamentary membership of 51 unless it is  varied\r\n\r\nby   law.   Accordingly,  a   Bill   entitled   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Membership Bill will be introduced at\r\n\r\nthe  present  sitting  of Parliament  in  order  to\r\n\r\nincrease   the  number  of  electoral  members   of\r\n\r\nParliament above the present membership of 51. This\r\n\r\nincrease  will  come into effect as from  the  next\r\n\r\ngeneral elections. However, for the purposes of the\r\n\r\nnext  general elections, it is necessary to publish\r\n\r\na  Gazette  Notification under  section  8  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Parliament Elections Ordinance specifying\r\n\r\nthe names and boundaries of the 58 revised\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nelectoral  divisions  and  to  prepare  for  public\r\n\r\ninspection  the  1967 registers of  electors  under\r\n\r\nsection  10  of  the same Ordinance.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nenable  these  steps to be taken, the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nMembership Bill, 1967, will be introduced  at  this\r\n\r\nsitting of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Bill, entitled the Singapore Parliament\r\n\r\nElections  (Amendment) Bill,  1967,  will  also  be\r\n\r\nintroduced.  This Bill will amend the Ordinance  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for the preparation of the first registers\r\n\r\nof  electors  from the register maintained  by  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  National  Registration   and   to\r\n\r\ninclude  in such electoral registers the  names  of\r\n\r\nall entitled persons who were, on the first day  of\r\n\r\nJuly  1967,  citizens  of  Singapore  and  to  whom\r\n\r\nidentity  cards were issued. The present  registers\r\n\r\nof  electors were first compiled nine years ago  in\r\n\r\n1958.  In  the  past, any person who  possessed  an\r\n\r\nidentity  card which shows his place  of  birth  as\r\n\r\nSingapore,   or  who  is  ordinarily  resident   in\r\n\r\nSingapore on the first day of February in any  year\r\n\r\nand  not less than 21 years of age on the first day\r\n\r\nof July in that year, was automatically included in\r\n\r\nthe  registers of electors. It is obvious that with\r\n\r\nSingapore's independent status only citizens can be\r\n\r\ngiven  the right to stand for election and to vote.\r\n\r\nIn  the recent re-registration campaign of persons,\r\n\r\nit  was discovered that a number of identity  cards\r\n\r\nhad  been  forged. Also, a number of  persons  with\r\n\r\nidentity  cards  showing their place  of  birth  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  were not given citizen's identity  cards\r\n\r\ndue   to   lack  of  adequate  proof  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship. For these reasons, fresh registers  of\r\n\r\nelectors  have to be compiled. The fresh  registers\r\n\r\nof  electors will be-compiled from the  records  of\r\n\r\ncitizens maintained by the Commissioner of National\r\n\r\nRegistration  and will include only  those  persons\r\n\r\nwho  produced  satisfactory evidence  of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship and who, on the first day of July 1967,\r\n\r\nwere  entitled to have their names entered  in  the\r\n\r\nfresh registers of electors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Singapore Parliament Elections\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Bill  has  become  law,   a   Gazette\r\n\r\nNotification will be published to specify the names\r\n\r\nand   boundaries   of  the  58  revised   electoral\r\n\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will only add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it is my\r\n\r\nintention  today to introduce only these two  Bills\r\n\r\nand to defer debate on them when the Second Reading\r\n\r\ncomes up on the 14th of this month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>BILLS INTRODUCED</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.24 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PRINTERS AND PUBLISHERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Printers and Publishers Ordinance\r\n\r\n(Chapter 196 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented  by the Minister for Culture  and  Social Affairs  (Inche  Othman Bin Wok);  read  the  First\r\n\r\ntime,  to  be  read a Second time on Tuesday,  14th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1967, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Singapore Parliament Elections\r\n\r\nOrdinance (Chapter 53 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented  by  the Deputy Prime Minister  (Dr  Toh Chin  Chye);  read the First time,  to  be  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time on Tuesday, 14th November, 1967, and to\r\n\r\nbe printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>PARLIAMENTARY MEMBERSHIP BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to vary the number of elected Members of\r\n\r\nParliament\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented  by  the Deputy Prime Minister  (Dr  Toh Chin  Chye);  read the First time,  to  be  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time on Tuesday, 14th November, 1967, and to\r\n\r\nbe printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>INCOME TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Income Tax Ordinance (Chapter 166\r\n\r\nof the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>recommendation of President signified; \r\n\r\npresented by the  Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee); read\r\n\r\nthe First\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\ntime,  to  be  read a Second time on Tuesday,  14th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1967, and to be printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MINOR OFFENCES (AMENDMENI) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to amend the Minor Offences Ordinance (Chapter\r\n\r\n117 of the Revised Edition)\",\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>presented  by  the  Minister for Law  and  National Development  (Mr  E.

With the experience gained  in\r\n\r\nGeylang  West, the programme has been  extended  to\r\n\r\nthree\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  constituencies, in Anson, Tanjong Pagar  and\r\n\r\nTelok Ayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the present Bill is to enable\r\n\r\nstatutory  bodies which have hawkers plying  within\r\n\r\nthe  limits of their estates to exercise powers and\r\n\r\ncontrol  normally  vested in the Health  Authority.\r\n\r\nThis  will enable effective and expeditious  action\r\n\r\nagainst  those  who are plying their trade  without\r\n\r\norder or control in these estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These powers are vested in the Director of\r\n\r\nMedical Services and his officers, and the proposed\r\n\r\namendments  are to enable the Director  of  Medical\r\n\r\nServices to delegate powers to control hawkers  and\r\n\r\nstalls  to a statutory body or statutory bodies  as\r\n\r\nand when it is found necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two sections only of the Ordinance are amended,\r\n\r\ni.e.,  section  77  which relates  to  stalls,  and\r\n\r\nsection  78  which  relates to  itinerant  hawkers.\r\n\r\nThese   two  sections  of  the  Ordinance   empower\r\n\r\nofficers  to  arrest,  serve  notices  and  impound\r\n\r\nproperties and articles which are put up  for  sale\r\n\r\nby unlicensed stall holders and hawkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important amendment is given as an additional\r\n\r\nsubsection  (15)  to section 78 which  extends  the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of public officer, for the purposes  of\r\n\r\nthese  two sections, to include \"any officer  of  a\r\n\r\nstatutory  board or body\". In this way any  officer\r\n\r\nof  a  Statutory  Board, such as  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, can exercise control  of  stalls\r\n\r\nand hawkers in their premises or properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments made to sections 77 and 78\r\n\r\nin  each  of their subsections (10) are similar  to\r\n\r\neach  other. The amendments will enable an  officer\r\n\r\nto   impound   or  seize  property  or   goods   of\r\n\r\nunauthorised stalls or hawkers not only  in  police\r\n\r\nstations or Government depots, as provided  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  sections, but to any \"such other  places\"\r\n\r\nas   may   be  approved  by  the  Director.   These\r\n\r\namendments will enable officers of the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board, for example,  to  impound  such\r\n\r\nseized properties\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwithin the Board's own premises.

Prosecutions\r\n\r\nunder  the  two Ordinances which may  control  such\r\n\r\nadvertisements,     namely,      the      Medicines\r\n\r\n(Advertisement and Sale) Ordinance, 1955,  and  the\r\n\r\nIndecent  Advertisement Ordinance (Cap. 142),  have\r\n\r\nbeen difficult and unsuccessful as advertisers have\r\n\r\ngot  round  the restrictions by using homonyms  and\r\n\r\nsynonyms or by claiming medical skills.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful consideration has been given to this\r\n\r\nproblem before it has reached the present stage  of\r\n\r\npresenting an amendment Bill to Parliament. As  far\r\n\r\nback  as  1962,  a Committee was appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nformer Minister under the chairmanship of Dr  Gwee\r\n\r\nAh  Leng,  one of Singapore's prominent physicians,\r\n\r\nto  examine the problem and to suggest measures  of\r\n\r\ncontrol with the following terms of reference: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to study the current undesirable and unethical\r\n\r\n`cures'  and  `advertisement  of  cures',  and   to\r\n\r\nsuggest measures of control.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee made certain recommendations for\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Medicines  (Advertisement  and\r\n\r\nSale)  Ordinance  to  prohibit  advertisements   of\r\n\r\nmedicines  for  various ailments and advertisements\r\n\r\nclaiming specific personal medical skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, in the second half of 1966, the\r\n\r\nCommittee   was   resuscitated   under   the   same\r\n\r\nchairmanship  but with wider terms of reference.  I\r\n\r\nquote the terms of reference, Mr Speaker: -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"to study the current unethical, dishonest and\r\n\r\nundesirable advertisements pertaining to treatment,\r\n\r\ncures,  and  to  the medical skills of  unqualified\r\n\r\npersons   and  to  suggest  measures  of  effective\r\n\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unanimous conclusions of this Committee\r\n\r\nextended   the  recommendations  of  the   previous\r\n\r\nCommittee  by reviewing and adding to the  list  of\r\n\r\ndiseases prohibited for general advertising and  by\r\n\r\nrecommending a ban on all advertisements pertaining\r\n\r\nto medical skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also made certain recommendations\r\n\r\nfor   the   effective  control  of  labelling   and\r\n\r\nimportation of drugs. However, these proposals  are\r\n\r\nbeing  dealt  with separately by the Controller  of\r\n\r\nImports  and Exports as they relate to his  control\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now to elaborate on the Bill clause\r\n\r\nby clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 sets out the Short Title and\r\n\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 4 of the Ordinance by\r\n\r\nsubstituting  a Schedule in place of  the  list  of\r\n\r\nconditions  and diseases mentioned  in  respect  of\r\n\r\nwhich  advertisements are prohibited. The  Schedule\r\n\r\nmay be amended by notification in the Gazette. This\r\n\r\narrangement  is  obviously  less  cumbersome   than\r\n\r\nhaving    to    amend   the   Ordinance    whenever\r\n\r\ncircumstances make it necessary to amend the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 creates a new section aimed at\r\n\r\nprohibiting  advertisements  relating  to   medical\r\n\r\nskill  or  service.  Medical practitioners  of  the\r\n\r\nWestern school are forbidden to advertise by  their\r\n\r\nethics  and  this is controlled by  a  disciplinary\r\n\r\nbody   of   the  profession  itself,  namely,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Medical Council. The Chinese Physicians'\r\n\r\nAssociation have also officially declared its stand\r\n\r\nin   public   against  advertisements  by   medical\r\n\r\npractitioners  of the Chinese school.  However,  in\r\n\r\ntheir case, they are handicapped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nby  the lack of a disciplinary board. The amendment\r\n\r\nin this section will, therefore, reinforce the hand\r\n\r\nof  the medical practitioners of the Chinese school\r\n\r\nwho  will now be able to see their stand reinforced\r\n\r\nby law. This prohibition will financially affect  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of publications in the Chinese medium,  but\r\n\r\npublic  interest  must supersede private  interest,\r\n\r\nhowever  much we may regret the loss of  income  to\r\n\r\nthese establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 amends section 5 of the Ordinance so\r\n\r\nthat  the prohibition of advertisements on articles\r\n\r\nrelating   to  abortion  is  extended  to  prohibit\r\n\r\nadvertisements  referring  to  medical   skill   or\r\n\r\nservice relating to abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5, which amends section 6 of the\r\n\r\nOrdinance,   is  consequential  on  the   preceding\r\n\r\nsections. It tidies up the references made  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious  prohibitions so that these  are  correctly\r\n\r\nreferred  to. As part of the tidying-up process,  a\r\n\r\nnew subsection is added to provide for reference to\r\n\r\nthe new prohibition of advertisements referring  to\r\n\r\nmedical skill or service within this section  which\r\n\r\nsets  out  provisions  as  to  offences  under  the\r\n\r\npreceding sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 7 of the Ordinance so as\r\n\r\nto  clarify  that where the required disclosure  of\r\n\r\ncomposition of a medicine is written in a  language\r\n\r\nother  than  the English language, such  disclosure\r\n\r\nmust be made in the English language as well as  in\r\n\r\nany other language that may be used in addition  to\r\n\r\nthe English language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 creates a Schedule of diseases and\r\n\r\nconditions  in respect of which advertisements  are\r\n\r\nto be controlled. This Schedule reviews the list of\r\n\r\nthe  various  diseases and conditions mentioned  in\r\n\r\nsection  4  of  the  Ordinance.  The  list  is  now\r\n\r\nextended  to include insanity, menstrual disorders,\r\n\r\nsexual   function,   infertility,   impotency   and\r\n\r\nfrigidity.  The  study by the two Committees  under\r\n\r\nDr  Gwee  Ah Leng has indicated that the  diseases\r\n\r\nand conditions mentioned in the Schedule constitute\r\n\r\nthe happy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhunting-ground  of  those unscrupulous  advertisers\r\n\r\nwho  seek to \"get rich quickly\" by preying  on  the\r\n\r\nanxiety  and desperation of the unfortunate victims\r\n\r\nof these diseases and conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of parties likely to be\r\n\r\ninterested in the proposals contained in this Bill,\r\n\r\nsuch as doctors, physicians, pharmacists, dentists,\r\n\r\nimporters   of   Chinese  drugs   and   advertising\r\n\r\nagencies.  It has therefore been decided that  this\r\n\r\nBill  be  referred  to a Select Committee,  if  the\r\n\r\nSecond   Reading  is  approved,   so   that   wider\r\n\r\nconsideration  might  be  given  to  the  suggested\r\n\r\namendments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I say that we owe a duty to the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore to protect them from  further\r\n\r\nruthless  exploitation  of this  kind  which  makes\r\n\r\nmoney  out of the sufferings and despair  of  those\r\n\r\nunable  to  judge  wisely.

This  will,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  give  an impetus to those fully  qualified\r\n\r\ndoctors  and  other persons who are  professionally\r\n\r\nqualified  to serve our sick people and to  promote\r\n\r\npublic health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if you turn to the Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspapers,  every  day  you  will  see  from   the\r\n\r\nadvertisements  that there are so many  undesirable\r\n\r\nadvertisements relating to various diseases.  There\r\n\r\nhave been a lot of quack doctors blowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir  own trumpets in the advertisements  to  show\r\n\r\nhow  efficient they are and that they  can  turn  a\r\n\r\nsick  man into a healthy, robust person. There  are\r\n\r\ngullible  people who fall for these advertisements.\r\n\r\nThey  not only lose their money, but some  of  them\r\n\r\neven lose their lives. So we can see the extent  of\r\n\r\nthe harm done by these undesirable advertisements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, Mr Speaker, we are quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with the code of ethics of  our  medical\r\n\r\nprofession  and  we must also take legal  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure that this code of ethics is observed so that\r\n\r\nthe  interest of the public together with  that  of\r\n\r\nthe  medical profession is upheld to the  exclusion\r\n\r\nof those undesirable and unscrupulous quack doctors\r\n\r\nwho  poison our people with all sorts of drugs.  In\r\n\r\nthis  way, Mr Speaker, we can see to it  that  the\r\n\r\ngood  reputation of the medical profession  is  not\r\n\r\ndamaged,  and  the  health of  the  public  is  not\r\n\r\njeopardised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in point of fact, the rise of these\r\n\r\nmedical advertisements can be attributed partly  to\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers themselves. They should  have  some\r\n\r\nmoral  responsibility towards their  readers.  They\r\n\r\nmust  know  what is right and what  is  wrong,  and\r\n\r\ncannot do things merely with a view to profiting at\r\n\r\nthe  expense  of  their readers who constitute  the\r\n\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own humble opinion, this amendment Bill\r\n\r\nwill  certainly receive the support of the  doctors\r\n\r\nand  the professional bodies in the medical  field.\r\n\r\nIt will certainly promote the medical profession in\r\n\r\nour  Republic  so that the services  and  medicines\r\n\r\nprescribed  by  qualified  doctors  will  be  given\r\n\r\nattention to, without the quack doctors fishing  in\r\n\r\ntroubled  waters.  In this way, we  will  certainly\r\n\r\nbecome  a  country  in  South-east  Asia  with  the\r\n\r\nhighest  standard  in the medical  profession.

Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon.

But\r\n\r\nit  is not too late however. A few moments ago  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Delta said that there  were  extensive\r\n\r\nadvertisements   both   in  the   Chinese   medical\r\n\r\nprofession   and   the   Western-trained    medical\r\n\r\nprofession.  As  pointed  out  by  Professor  Yeoh,\r\n\r\nWestern-trained   doctors  are   not   allowed   to\r\n\r\nadvertise and the position has been clarified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of this Bill is to protect the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the  public, not to protect  Western-trained  doctors  or  Chinese  doctors  or   Indian\r\n\r\ndoctors  for that matter. We admit that  there  are\r\n\r\ndrugs advertised in the newspapers manufactured  in\r\n\r\nthe Western world. But I wish to stress that in  so\r\n\r\nfar   as   drugs  manufactured  in  the  West   are\r\n\r\nconcerned, after clinical experiments on them  have\r\n\r\nbeen  carried  out and they are approved  for  use,\r\n\r\nthey  are not allowed to be advertised. So this  is\r\n\r\nquite different from the drugs manufactured by  the\r\n\r\nChinese  physicians. Of course, we do not deny  the\r\n\r\nefficacy of some Chinese drugs. But there are cases\r\n\r\nin  which  quack  doctors or businessmen  who  call\r\n\r\nthemselves doctors or physicians have advertised in\r\n\r\nthe papers for their own personal gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also said that the\r\n\r\nrise  of the medical advertisements should also  be\r\n\r\nattributed partly to the newspapers. But in my  own\r\n\r\nview,  the  position is not so had as he thinks.  I\r\n\r\nknow  of  one  case  where  one  paper  was  losing\r\n\r\nbusiness to the extent of some $3,000 a month,  and\r\n\r\nit was proposed by a quack doctor that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadvertisement  to  the amount of  $3,000  would  be\r\n\r\ngiven  provided the newspaper accepted him  as  its\r\n\r\nmedical  adviser; but this was turned down  by  the\r\n\r\nnewspaper. So it shows that the position is not  so\r\n\r\nbad as the Member would think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as other Members have already\r\n\r\npointed  out,  this Bill should be  referred  to  a\r\n\r\nSelect Committee for further consideration, because\r\n\r\neven  at a random reading now, I can see that there\r\n\r\nare  many  loopholes in the present  Bill,  because\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  quack doctors  may  not  advertise\r\n\r\ndirectly but may advertise indirectly. For example,\r\n\r\none  may  say  that  he  has been  abroad  to  give\r\n\r\nlectures  and  has been given some award,  so  that\r\n\r\nwhen  he  comes back, he will be able to serve  our\r\n\r\nsick  people  better.  This is  another  aspect  of\r\n\r\nadvertising and should be given attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Sir, I wish to\r\n\r\nsay  a few words on this amendment Bill. Few people\r\n\r\nhave  supported it. If we are going to bring  in  a\r\n\r\nlaw on advertisements of medicines, it is not going\r\n\r\nto  affect  one  group, whether they  are  Indians,\r\n\r\nWesterners  or Chinese. If there is a  law,  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to affect everybody. The Member for Tampines\r\n\r\nand   others  have  said  that  Westerners  do  not\r\n\r\nadvertise like this. But the law is not like  that.\r\n\r\nMaybe  they do not do it today, but they may do  it\r\n\r\ntomorrow. Whether they are Chinese or Indians, they\r\n\r\nhave  to  obey the law. It is a law for  everybody.\r\n\r\nThey  may  not  do  it today but  they  may  do  it\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  So we have to bring in a law to  protect\r\n\r\neven  for  the future. It should benefit everybody.\r\n\r\nIf  we  look  into this, the people are cheated  in\r\n\r\nmany  ways. They have spoilt themselves  by  taking\r\n\r\nmany  kinds of medicine. If we go through the  list\r\n\r\nof  diseases  listed here, many people  may  be  in\r\n\r\nfavour   of  taking  these  medicines.  Take,   for\r\n\r\nexample,  diabetes. It is found in many people  who\r\n\r\nare  over 45 years of age. They are anxious to cure\r\n\r\nthe disease and they are prepared to take any\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedicine, whether it is advertised in the papers or\r\n\r\nwhether  they hear of it from friends.  I  am  also\r\n\r\naffected. That is why I am saying this.  I  am  not\r\n\r\ntaking   medicines   which   are   recommended   in\r\n\r\nadvertisements but I am taking medicines prescribed\r\n\r\nby   doctors.  Many  people  may  be   cheated   by\r\n\r\nadvertisements. So I appreciate the action  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment in bringing forward this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  will  stop many people from getting  themselves\r\n\r\nspoilt. Even old people, including me, may want  to\r\n\r\nfeel younger as they grow older So I may look for a\r\n\r\nmedicine to achieve this. But some people take  the\r\n\r\nwrong medicine and get spoilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important law but it should not affect\r\n\r\none  particular group or race. It should be  common\r\n\r\nto all the races.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Its  responsibilities were inherited  from\r\n\r\nits original sponsors, the Rubber Trade Association\r\n\r\nof  Singapore and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\nRubber Association. The Association not only  deals\r\n\r\nin  the day-to-day operation of the clearing house,\r\n\r\nregulation  of  trading,  shipping  and  fixing  of\r\n\r\nprices,  but  also  in  the  fields  of  contracts,\r\n\r\narbitration, packing standards and disciplining  of\r\n\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association's income depends entirely on\r\n\r\nmembers' subscriptions, tender fees and commissions\r\n\r\non    auction   sales.   In   recent   years,   the\r\n\r\nAssociation's   income  from  these   sources   has\r\n\r\ndeclined.  To  enable the Association  to  function\r\n\r\neffectively  and competitively and to maintain  and\r\n\r\napprove  the  high  standards  of  conduct  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  rubber  market, it is clearly  necessary\r\n\r\nthat the Association should have adequate finances.\r\n\r\nWith  this  in  mind,  the  Association  approached\r\n\r\nGovernment  with  a  proposal  that  it  should  be\r\n\r\nauthorised  to  levy  a cess on rubber  exportation\r\n\r\nfrom  Singapore and to use the proceeds of the cess\r\n\r\nto   cover  its  expenditure.  Since  there   were,\r\n\r\nhowever,   legal   objections  to  empowering   the\r\n\r\nAssociation,  as incorporated under  the  Societies\r\n\r\nOrdinance, to collect a cess,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  was considered that the most appropriate  means\r\n\r\nof overcoming these objections was to constitute  a\r\n\r\nCorporation to replace the Association. The  assets\r\n\r\nand property of the Association would then vest  in\r\n\r\nthe  Corporation. This is offered under  clauses  3\r\n\r\nand 4 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal objects of the Corporation are to\r\n\r\npromote sales and exports of rubber from Singapore,\r\n\r\nto  collect  a  cess  on rubber  exports  for  this\r\n\r\npurpose,  and make rules and regulations  governing\r\n\r\nthe  marketing of rubber (clauses 4  and  14).  The\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the statutory body is  vested  in  a\r\n\r\nManagement Committee, which consists of 15 members,\r\n\r\nseven  of  whom are nominated by the  Rubber  Trade\r\n\r\nAssociation  of  Singapore and seven  of  whom  are\r\n\r\nnominated  by  the  Singapore Chamber  of  Commerce\r\n\r\nRubber  Association.  The  remaining  member  is  a\r\n\r\npublic  officer.  It is proposed that  this  public\r\n\r\nofficer  will  be  the Director  of  Trade  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Finance.

Problems common\r\n\r\nto  both the communities in the trade have to  some\r\n\r\nextent   been  successfully  dealt  with   by   the\r\n\r\nAssociation  in the past. This move to  incorporate\r\n\r\nthe  Rubber Association of Singapore as a corporate\r\n\r\nbody  with  perpetual succession is indeed  timely.\r\n\r\nThis  intention to provide for the conducting of  a\r\n\r\nrubber market in Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe regulation of the rubber trade and to establish\r\n\r\na Singapore Rubber Fund is very commendable in view\r\n\r\nof  the  importance of the commodity to Singapore's\r\n\r\ntrade  and  of the importance of Singapore  in  the\r\n\r\nrubber  business. But what strikes me most is  that\r\n\r\nthe  matter  does not seem to have been given  more\r\n\r\ncareful  thought  in the drafting of  the  proposed\r\n\r\nBill.  Under the present practice, one might become\r\n\r\na  member  of  the Rubber Association of  Singapore\r\n\r\nonly if he were sponsored by either one of the  two\r\n\r\ncomponent  Associations and duly  proposed  by  two\r\n\r\nexisting  members  of  the  Rubber  Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill now provides for membership to\r\n\r\nthe  corporation as laid down in clause 7,  whereby\r\n\r\nany  person  carrying on or intending to  carry  on\r\n\r\nbusiness  in  such classes of the rubber  trade  or\r\n\r\nindustry  may  be  admitted.  Members  of  the  two\r\n\r\nexisting  component  Associations  of  the  present\r\n\r\nRubber  Association of Singapore are  automatically\r\n\r\nmembers of the proposed Corporation. In view of the\r\n\r\nfact   that   under  the  Bill  before  the   House\r\n\r\nmembership  is being thrown open to all and  sundry\r\n\r\nin  the trade in accordance with clause 7, I see no\r\n\r\nreason at all why any member of the Corporation who\r\n\r\nis admitted in accordance with clause 7 of the Bill\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be nominated by either one  of  the  two\r\n\r\ncomponent  Associations in order to be eligible  to\r\n\r\nserve  in  the  Management Committee. The  proposed\r\n\r\nBill sets up a corporate body with wider membership\r\n\r\nqualifications.

The  proposed  Bill\r\n\r\nprovides that the Minister has the final say in all\r\n\r\nappointments.  I fully support the  Bill,  but  the\r\n\r\nfact still remains that members of any organisation\r\n\r\nshould  have  the right and privilege  to  nominate\r\n\r\nfrom  amongst its own members a Committee to manage\r\n\r\nthe affairs of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganisation.

Members  of the two  existing  component\r\n\r\nAssociations  of the present Rubber Association  of\r\n\r\nSingapore are automatically members of the proposed\r\n\r\nCorporation.
