Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill before the House seeks to amend the Subordinate Courts Act as part of a general plan to restructure the jurisdiction and powers of the courts in Singapore. Two other Bills have been approved by this House yesterday. This is the third Bill as part of the restructuring. Since certain provisions in this Bill are similar to the Bill approved yesterday to amend the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, I will not be dealing with such provisions. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 131</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil jurisdiction of the District Court is at present limited to the following matters: First, monetary claims not exceeding $50,000 founded on contract or tort or under any written law; second, action for the recovery of immovable property where title is not in dispute; third, proceedings for the grant of probate and administration acts; fourth, proceedings for distress of rent; and fifth, interpleader proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law applicable to these proceedings constitutes actually a very small part of the civil law in Singapore. Most of the disputes in the proceedings turn on the facts and hardly involve any points of law, leave alone complicated points of law. As a result, the civil work of a District Judge does not really prepare him for hearing civil disputes in the High Court if eventually he should be appointed a Judge of the High Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 5 and 9 increase the civil jurisdiction of a District Court to include the following matters: First, non-monetary claims founded on contract or tort; second, actions for the recovery of immovable property even where title is in dispute; and third, certain equity proceedings. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 increases the monetary limit of a District Court from $50,000 to $100,000 generally, and from $250,000 to $3 million for grant of probate and administration actions. Clause 14 provides that these limits may be amended from time to time, up or down, by the President after consulting the Chief Justice. The President has to act on the advice of the Cabinet before making such order. Under the existing provisions, the Subordinate Courts Act has to be amended in order to vary the monetary limits. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enlarged civil jurisdiction will enable District Judges to acquire a broader range of experience and a more extensive knowledge of the law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 increases the jurisdiction of a Magistrate's Court from $10,000 to $30,000. But there is no increase in the subject jurisdiction of a Magistrate's Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clause 22 empowers a Subordinate Court to refer any constitutional issue arising in an action before it to the High Court for determination. This is only right because a Subordinate Court is not the appropriate forum to determine such an issue. Provision is made for the Attorney-General to be heard on any such issue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Sir, I shall be very brief. I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Bill, the civil jurisdictions of a District Court and a Magistrate's Court have been increased. This will result in improved efficiency in the administration of justice. The Government Parliamentary Committee welcomes the plan to restructure the courts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in particular, I welcome the new section 41A in clause 18 which provides that the Chief Justice may by order direct proceedings commenced in the District Court to be heard and determined by the High Court. This, in my mind, is a welcome safeguard to the system when we are investing enhanced responsibilities and powers to the District and Magistrate's Court. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho Peng Kee (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, I speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reorganisation of the Subordinate Courts flows from the restructuring of the Supreme Court. Now that the Judges and Magistrates of the Subordinate Courts have enlarged civil jurisdiction, it is imperative that more attention be focused on their training and development. This should be done in relation to both legal as well as other related skills and knowledge. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, two points should be considered. First, is there a need to raise the qualifying criterion before a person can be appointed as a judicial officer of the Subordinate Courts, especially in the case of Magistrates and Deputy Registrars? Currently, no qualifying period exists before which a \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> person can be appointed as Deputy Registrar. In the case of a Magistrate, a lawyer of more than a year's standing may be appointed -just one year. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans are surprised that some of our Deputy Registrars and Magistrates are relatively young. In these young hands lie the power to decide the commercial and personal fate of fellow Singaporeans. Dispensation of justice and application of the law do not take place in a vacuum but in the context of Singapore's social milieu. Not only is legal knowledge important but also wisdom that comes with experience in dealing with matters of the world. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, is there a need to ensure that our Magistrates and Judges in the Subordinate Courts are better prepared to undertake their important tasks? Sir, may I offer three suggestions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a mentoring scheme - where new Judges and Magistrates are attached to more experienced ones to, in the first instance, understudy and observe and, on a continuing basis, to consult and discuss difficult points of law. In this way, new appointees can also cultivate that important X-factor - a judicial temperament. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, structured in-house seminars where latest developments and emerging areas of the law can be fully ventilated and experience shared. NUS law staff can be enlisted for this purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, workshops to develop better interpersonal and communication skills. Judicial officers are figures of authority. In dispensing justice, they must be able to inspire confidence in the lawyers and clients with whom they deal. Observers in the gallery also form opinions of our judicial system from what they see. It can be an unnerving experience for young and new judicial officers to handle lawyers who are senior in age, experience and wisdom. It is easy to overlook this area which I feel is important. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that a loose version of these improvement schemes has been introduced in the Subordinate Courts. They should be better structured and \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 134</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> formalised. Some countries like Japan take the training of judges very seriously. And why not! \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to support the Bill. Whilst I am no lawyer to go into the details of the qualifications of the District Judges, I would like to ask the Minister - with the passage of this Bill, the District Judges would have their civil jurisdiction increased to $100,000 - what percentage of the workload in the High Court will then be reduced and shifted to these District Courts and can the District Courts cope? Would that also mean there is no more need to appoint High Court Judges or there is no more need for additional Judicial Commissioners? Could the Minister also assure the House that there is no more need, as mentioned some years ago, for recruiting foreign judges in the High Court? Maybe the Minister could explain how these changes in the jurisdiction could bring about more efficiency as simply transferring the workload from the High Court to the District Judges may not just increase efficiency. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Members who have spoken. Dr Arthur Beng did not raise any specific points that require an answer. Mr Ho Peng Kee raised several points. Of course, on the question of qualifying criterion for Magistrates exercising civil jurisdiction, I have no doubt that the Chief Justice will look into this. Magistrates are appointed from legal officers with one to five years' experience, as far as I know, and no legal officer who has not undergone some period of induction is likely to be appointed a Magistrate. Most civil cases in the Magistrate's Court are in fact decided on facts. There is usually very little argument on issues of law and much less difficult issues of law. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the mentor system, I understand that there has, in fact, been in place in the Subordinate Courts a mentor system for some years and I believe it is working well. I also understand that there is also in place a programme for training and continuing legal education for junior officers. For example, last week, they participated in a seminar on \"Probation of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 135</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> offenders\". I was told that before that, they also attended a lecture on how to write judgments which was given by one of the more experienced judges, Mr L P Thean. But we must remember that the judiciary in both the High Court and the Subordinate Courts is actually quite small. I believe the Chief Justice is doing all that he can to ensure that our Magistrates and District Judges will have a sufficient knowledge of the law as well as communication skills and the factor of temperament referred to by Mr Ho Peng Kee. With all these skills, they would, in dispensing justice, inspire confidence in the lawyers and others appearing before them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia Shi Teck asked for the percentage of the workload. I am afraid I do not have such data. It will ease the workload of the High Court to some extent but, as I mentioned, that is not the only objective. Does this mean that there will be no more need to appoint more High Court Judges? I do not think we should come to such a conclusion because the volume of work in the courts will always increase. If our economic growth is sustained, there will be more litigation and more cases will come up to the courts. And if we want to increase the extent to which we clear up the backlog, I am sure more Judges will be needed as time goes on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member referred to foreign Judges. I believe he was referring to a discussion which took place in this Chamber many years ago. I do not think the question \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 136</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> really arises now as to whether foreign Judges have to be appointed. The main question is: can we get Judges from Singaporeans or permanent residents who are familiar with our system, our laws, our aspirations and our goals, in other words, people who are familiar not only with the jurisprudence but also the values which are embedded in our corpus of jurisprudence. If we can get these people to come forth and take up judicial appointments either as permanent High Court Judges or as Judicial Commissioners, and if the Chief Justice is able to get them and persuade them and they are appointed, then I think this question of foreign Judges does not arise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Prof. S.

The Board will be a one-stop resource centre bringing together the National Museum, the National Archives and the Oral History Department, the current heritage departments of the Ministry of the Information and the Arts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Heritage Board will explore and present the heritage and nationhood of the people of Singapore in the context of their ancestral cultures, their links with Southeast Asia, with Asia and with the world through the collection, preservation, interpretation and display of objects and records. It will also promote public awareness, appreciation and understanding of our past. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a statutory board, the National Heritage Board will enjoy flexibility in its operation and in recruiting, deploying and developing staff. There are also cost savings in integrating the three departments into a single organisation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government will fund the greater part of the development and recurrent costs of the National Heritage Board, it is very important that we also encourage members of the public, as corporations and as individuals, to give their full support. The Government has announced plans to expand the present National Museum and organise the exhibits into separate museums. The \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 138</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Singapore Art Museum and the Asian Civilisations Museum and the History of Singapore Museum will be ready from 1995 onwards. We will provide ample scope for public participation. Collectors and well-wishers from Singapore and abroad will be encouraged to lend and donate their art collections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a young nation, it will take us many generations to build up our national collection. Unlike countries like the UK and France, we have no imperial booty to draw upon. Happily, travelling exhibitions are easier to organise in the age of the jumbo jet. Thus, we have been able to put up world-class exhibitions on Imperial China at Empress Place. We recently signed an agreement to bring in exhibits from India, and I hope to sign similar agreements with the Turkish and the Egyptian Governments later this year. Next month, the National Museum will display 63 exquisite pieces from the Rockefeller Collection of the Asia Society. In this way, we supplement our own collection with loans from others. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various communities in Singapore should also participate in the effort to preserve our heritage. They are in a good position to collect, preserve and promote an awareness of their own heritage in a living way. As I announced last year, the Federation of Chinese Clans Association is interested to set up a Chinese Heritage Centre at the old Nantah Administration Building to research and present the heritage of the Chinese outside China, their migratory patterns and way of life and the way they have sunk roots in different countries and made contributions to local communities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malay community is now exploring the concept and feasibility of setting up a Malay Heritage Centre. The Government will make available the old Istana at Kampong Glam for this purpose at nominal rental. Likewise, the Government will provide similar assistance to the Indian and Eurasian communities. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I informed the House during the Committee of Supply, the Government \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 139</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> will help the four communities set up endowment funds to run these centres subject to a ceiling of $5 million for the Chinese, $2 million for the Malays, $1 million for the Indians and $1/4 million for the Eurasians on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For the Singapore History Museum, it will present Singapore's history in a national and international context. The community heritage centres can capture the social and cultural heritage of each community in greater depth and in a more particular way. These heritage centres will help Singaporeans anchor their cultural roots. In this way, we strike a balance between emphasising our unity and celebrating our diversity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Heritage Board will also work closely with the Singapore Heritage Society and other heritage organisations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will give maximum autonomy to the National Heritage Board. The Board will formulate its own personnel policies so that the right people can be engaged, retained and developed. There is a shortage of trained and experienced heritage administrators in Singapore, a shortage that may hamper the development of our museums and archives. The National Heritage Board will help to build up such a core of heritage professionals. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Government's financial support, the National Heritage Board will be free to raise its own revenue and receive donations in cash and in kind. All donations to the National Heritage Board will be tax-exempt. For donations to the National Museum, the Finance Minister has recently announced that double tax deduction will be allowed. The Board will also be free to acknowledge donors by naming rooms or wings in the various museums after them. The Board will also be able to form companies to undertake functions more effectively carried out on a commercial basis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Heritage Board will comprise a Chairman, a Deputy \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Chairman and 10 to 25 other members. The membership will be broad-based. We will have representatives from heritage organisations, the private sector and the public sector. We have to strike a balance between supporting heritage for heritage sake and getting value for money. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the National Heritage Board is well advised on methods pertaining to heritage in Singapore and elsewhere, the Bill enables the Board to form advisory committees. Their members need not and should not be confined to Singaporeans. We must look for foreigners who can help us. These committees will cover the major fields of museums, archives and oral history. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Heritage Board will have powers similar to other statutory boards. Its specific powers include developing and managing museums, archives, oral history centres and other facilities. It will also be empowered to conduct archaeological investigations of land under development which the Board believes may contain artefacts of historical or heritage value. In exercising this power, the Board will be careful to minimise inconvenience to the owners of the affected premises. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Heritage Board will absorb the present staff and properties of the National Museum, the National Archives and the Oral History Department. The National Heritage Board Bill provides for the repeal of the National Archives and Records Centre Act of 1967. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of our effort in heritage is to instil in all Singaporeans the sense that while we are a young nation, we are an ancient people. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ho Peng Kee (Sembawang GRC):</b> Sir, I speak in support of the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The integration of the National Museum, National Archives and Oral History Department is timely. Indeed, some will say it is overdue. It will provide \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> greater coherence and synergy to Government's efforts in ensuring that Singaporeans, particularly younger ones, remember and cherish our roots. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an important result of the Bill is that more Singaporeans and foreigners with relevant expertise, as the Minister has mentioned just now, will have a say in how our heritage, both as Singaporeans and as members of different races with global links, is preserved, interpreted and presented. Heritage is never a top-down exercise. To invoke passion and a sense of belonging, involvement and identification are vital. This the Bill seeks to achieve. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope Singaporeans will indeed feel this sense of passion in being involved and being identified with the cause underlying the Bill. We have heard from the Minister that the setting up of community heritage centres or museums is part of this overall approach. Each community is given the opportunity to share its heritage and culture with fellow Singaporeans, and it is a good thing that they themselves have a say on how this is to be done. In this way, greater awareness and pride are created in one's roots and culture. However, may I add a word of caution here. I hope this awareness and pride will not stop there. Awareness must cross the physical boundaries of one's own community museum to encompass the other community museums or centres of the other races. And more importantly, pride must not rest solely on one's own roots, but rise to a higher and common level, based on the fact that we are all Singaporeans. I hope parents will make the extra effort to bring their children to visit not only their own community museum, but also those of the other races and the Singapore History Museum. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools and community groups can do likewise. Here, Sir, I would urge MITA to monitor the racial profile of visitors to each of these museums when they are set up and take appropriate steps should there be an imbalance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's heritage is also captured by several buildings and structures dotting the island. Examples are the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 142</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Ford Factory, St James Power Station and the Armenian Church. There are many other examples that I am sure Members know of. Each of them, Sir, has a story to tell. I would like to ask the Minister whether steps are being taken to ensure that these stories are told, again and again, to our children and their children. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I think it is common experience that in many quizzes that are conducted in Singapore, participants seem to know more about world history and events than Singapore's history or events which impact on Singapore's major races. I hope this Bill will go some way to rectify this unfortunate situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, no society could be strong and resilient if it detaches itself from the past. A Spanish-born American philosopher, George Santayana, once said, \"Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness ... Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to fulfil it.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for a country with a short history, such linkage to the past is a crucial factor in building the foundation for the future. It is an amalgam needed for the evolution of a great society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the National Heritage Board with the objective of bringing the National Museum, the National Archives and Records Centre and the Oral History Department, therefore, must be seen in this context. After the setting up of the National Arts Council, the formation of the National Heritage Board is a logical step. The introduction of this Bill is. therefore, both timely and essential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike my colleague who said that this is a bit too late, to me, Sir, the Bill is a first step that provides a seriously coordinated effort in proactively using the past to the optimum in educating the future generation of their past history and culture. In doing so, we are \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> also meeting the challenge of whether we have the wisdom to use wealth to enrich and elevate our national life and to advance our quality of civilization. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have committed ourselves into the Next Lap and our varied past that stemmed from the rich Chinese, Indian and Malay civilizations are assets to us. The setting up of this Board, therefore, should ensure that these multi-cultural aspects of Singapore are sufficiently projected and represented. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago, I raised in this House the question of acquisition of our cultural artefacts which could possibly be buried in Singapore, its surrounding islands and seas, and the possibility of introducing laws to effect their acquisition. In this connection, I wish to thank the Minister for incorporating clauses under the Miscellaneous Provisions in clause 46 the power to achieve this aim. However, the element of compensation or compensations to those who suffer loss as a result of the acquisition work is not clearly stated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question that I would like to ask the Minister is: since the effort to preserve or redevelop certain places or locations with historical significance will also involve some degree of participation from the communities who had been part of the life of such places, I wonder whether their aspirations and participation are given sufficient consideration. As an example, when we decided to preserve the Kampong Glam area, whether we had made the effort to seek for the opinions or views of those people who are living in this area. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Braddell Heights)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, now that we have made certain achievements in economic performance, we are beginning to spend some time and effort on cultural matters and development of the culture of Singapore. To preserve our cultural heritage is an effort in the spiritual \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> construction of Singapore. Therefore, I welcome the National Heritage Board Bill which seeks to set up a centralised coordinating statutory body for the preservation of our national heritage so that we will be better able to carry out the work of preserving our cultural heritage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Chinese saying goes, \"to do a job well, we must have the good tools in hand.\" The National Heritage Board, when established, will be able to work towards the preservation of our cultural heritage and artefacts and create favourable conditions for this purpose. Apart from material conditions, we should also have some talents in this field to come forward to do the work. Unfortunately, I believe that we are in dire shortage of such talents in Singapore. So to carry out this work of preserving our heritage, I think we will have a great obstacle here. I would like to ask the Minister what plans he has to develop and nurture such talents that are so badly needed in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we know that we are a society that places emphasis on commerce, science and technology. People do not seem to give much weightage on culture and artefacts. Even in our own university, there is no Department of Archaeology. Even if we have such a subject, graduates majoring in the subject will not be able to find jobs easily. Now, with the establishment of the National Heritage Board and we are launching all our efforts to preserving our cultural heritage, we need more of such talents. I believe that, at the beginning, we may find it necessary to recruit such talents partially from overseas. But I hope that the Minister will not overlook the need to develop such talents locally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from my knowledge, there are people in Singapore who are interested in culture and in the preservation of culture. They have done some studies and research on this. I think we have such people around, albeit not many in number. These people are working \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> quietly because of their own personal interest. I hope that after the establishment of the National Heritage Board, we will be able to take advantage of these rare talents that we have locally. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am also glad to know that the Government is encouraging every community here to set up its own heritage centre. For example, for the Chinese community, a museum on Chinese emigration will be set up at the former administration block of the Nanyang University. This is a very significant project. The Government has also promised to provide financial assistance to the various communities in this direction. I believe that this kind of work needs not only financial assistance but also expertise. I would like to ask whether the Government has any plans to help these various communities by providing them with the necessary expertise. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members for their encouragement and support. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first answer Mr Ho Peng Kee's concern that when we develop community heritage centres, each community will be interested only in its own ethnic heritage. That will be wrong. I fully agree with Mr Ho that we should encourage mutual sharing and mutual understanding so that a Chinese Singaporean, for instance, should feel somehow that the Mahabarata, the Ramayana and the Hikayat Hang Tuah are somehow a part of his heritage, a part of his inheritance, and feel enriched by it. And vice versa; that the Malays should also see in the Chinese and the Indian something which makes them what they are today. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take Mr Ho's suggestion that MITA should monitor the pattern of visits to these centres when they are established, and indeed MITA is already working with the Education Ministry to encourage our school children to visit exhibitions at our museums. For instance, the exhibitions of Imperial China at Empress Place are truly \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> outstanding and it is a great pity if our school children are not marched through. They may not appreciate, young as they are now, art in all their aspects, but they should at least know. One day, they will recall, and they will recall with satisfaction and they would have improved in the process. But, of course, we must make it easier for the teachers by providing explanatory booklets and maybe simple quiz sheets so that the teachers at the end of the day can ask the students to put something down. And maybe those who do well in these quizzes can be given small gifts or maybe hamburgers at a fast-food joint or something. I am sure we can work out some such ideas to make it more lively and more interesting for our young school children to visit heritage centres. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Ho's concern about some of the sites in Singapore being not well maintained and with stories untold, this is a problem which has vexed MITA for some time. Last year, in conjunction with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the fall of Singapore, we made a special effort to spruce up these sites and, in fact, to open some sites which were never opened before, like the Percival Tunnel Complex at Fort Canning and the Johore Battery at Changi. But we have no organisation to keep these open. So after organising exhibitions for a few weeks, we sealed these sites and it may be some time before they are reopened. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am against the National Museum taking over all these sites because the National Museum is already over extended. I think their plate is already over full with projects. But at the same time, this is an area which we should not neglect. So I am thinking of a way of co-opting members of the public, individuals and corporations, who are interested to help us. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the Singapore Heritage Society and indeed last year, when we had an exhibition at the Ford Factory, the work was largely done by members of the Heritage Society. So I am thinking of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> establishing a Heritage Trust which should be a civic organisation supported by the National Heritage Board, an organisation which is somewhere in between a fully private and a fully public body. I think that way we will be able to strike a balance between getting people outside to help us and at the same time giving them enough support so that they will not be running around trying to raise funds all the time. And it is very important. If you look at the gun emplacements at Labrador Park and many other such sites in Singapore, the grass is well trimmed and flowers are planted, but it is not the same. When you visit a site and there is someone to tell you the story, it comes to life and then it achieves its full value. Otherwise, you just pass it by as another ruin and the whole import misses you. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yatiman Yusof was concerned that owners of premises which are being investigated for possible historical artefacts may be left uncompensated. Let me assure him that our objective is not to cause inconvenience to them. Indeed, we have to minimise inconvenience and if compensation is justified, then compensation will surely be arranged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his concern that the residents of Kampong Glam have not been kept informed of the proposal by Mr Ridzwan Dzafir's working committee on the Malay Heritage Centre, I will ask the committee to consult freely those who have lived in the area or who show a special interest in the area, so that when the Centre is finally established it will become an organic part of what is, in fact, a very historical location in Singapore. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Goh Choon Kang raised the problem of a lack of professional expertise in the museum area. That is very true but we are now working very hard to overcome this lack of expertise. The National Museum has been recruiting. We have also been buying expertise in the form of consultants and we are prepared to engage foreign curators if local curators are not available. I think what we want to do here \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is not to be excessively nationalistic, but to source expertise wherever and whenever expertise is available. Take, for instance, the present peranakan jewellery exhibition at the National Museum called \"Gilding the Phoenix\". I commend the exhibition to all Members. It is very well done and it is a splendid collection. I myself was surprised when I toured the exhibition with the First Lady when she opened it, that the Peranakans in fact have a separate set of jewellery just for mourning. They call it tuahar jewellery, which is all white. So I asked the curator, \"How did this come about?\" because it is not in the Chinese customs. Neither is it in the Malay customs because the Malays do not have tuahar. So it is a mutation, a curious adaptation of Chinese mourning practices in the use of white for mourning and the Malay's love for ornamentation and jewellery. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exhibition was curated by a young man called Mr Edmund Chin who used to work for the Monetary Authority of Singapore and who took a whole year off just to work on this exhibition. So for him, it had been a labour of love. I overheard the conversation between him and the First Lady and he was talking in the Peranakan patois, and they were enjoying themselves fully as they went through the exhibits. So here is the National Museum co-opting talents outside the Museum and to the benefit of all of us. So it is something we should encourage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will remember that I mentioned in this House before that Mr Low Chuck Tiew contributed some of his paintings to the Hong Kong Museum. I met Mr Low Chuck Tiew a few months ago and I found him a treasure house of knowledge about Chinese calligraphy and Chinese arts. His depth was marvellous. So I invited him to be an adviser to our Asian Civilisations Museum, and he has accepted. This is the way we will do it. We will co-opt expertise where they are available. We will train where we can, and we will recruit where we can. In this way, we will maximise the chances of success for our entire effort in heritage. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am pleased to note that the ground is much more favourable now. Without having hard statistics to support me, but just on the basis of my subjective impression, I find many young undergraduates showing great interest in the arts and, many who are overseas, sometimes against the wishes of their parents, have decided to do courses in art history, in archaeology and so on. This partly reflects the fact that the job prospects for culture and heritage in Singapore are much better today than they were, say, five or ten years ago. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo]. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX BILL</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Mr Low Thia Khiang, the Member for Hougang, be discharged from the Select Committee on the Goods and Services Tax Bill.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 19th March 1993, when we were debating the Goods and Services Tax Bill, I made it very clear in my speech that I was against the implementation of the GST. The Workers' Party has also stated in the press that we were against the GST. However, after the Second Reading of the GST Bill, the Minister for Finance suddenly announced that I was appointed a Member of the Select Committee on the Bill. Then, in a manner as sudden as lightning, Parliament approved the appointment of the said Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My immediate feeling then was that acceptance of appointment as a Member of the Select Committee on the GST Bill would be contradictory to my stand. I also considered the fact that as a Member of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Parliament I had certain responsibilities to the House for whatever duty it assigned to me. Therefore, I felt that I should consult the Central Committee of the Party before I made any decision. Regrettably, Parliament immediately approved the appointment of the Select Committee and I had no chance to make known my position. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the best of my knowledge, the main function of the Select Committee is to look into the details of the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax Bill, and, if necessary, to make the necessary amendments thereto. There is no room for opposition to the principle of the Bill. It is also not possible to reverse the Bill which has already gone through its Second Reading. In other words, the Select Committee may even have to study and discuss how the GST could be effectively levied on the people. So to be a member of this Select Committee will be inconsistent with the stand of the Workers' Party which is clearly against the implementation of the GST. Accordingly, my Party feels that I should ask to be discharged from the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, according to the procedure of the UK House of Commons, for appointment of Members to Select Committees, the Party Whip would normally be consulted first, and the party would then nominate its Members for appointment to the Select Committee concerned. But in Singapore, the appointee has absolutely no prior knowledge at all of his appointment to the Select Committee. The Parliamentary Committee of Selection does not consult the Members concerned before making the appointment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a Member of Parliament, I know I am obliged to obey the decision of Parliament and to accept the assignments given to me by Parliament. However, when a Member has clearly stated that he is against the Bill in question and yet forced to be a Member of the Select Committee on that Bill, and compelled to participate in the process of improving the Bill, I think it is against the wishes of the appointee and it is unfair. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the people will be very confused about the stand of the Member concerned. Just imagine, the Workers' Party and its Member in this House have clearly stated that they are against the GST, yet the same Member is sitting in the Select Committee to discuss how to more effectively collect GST from the people, and even to convince the people to accept GST. Is it not ridiculous? I therefore urge the House to consider my position and my predicament and discharge me from the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Leader of the House) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Leader of the House (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I am really disappointed with the position taken by Mr Low Thia Khiang. When Parliament debated the Bill on 19th March 1993, he was present and all of us know his views. We all know his Party's views. It objected to the GST Bill. When the Minister for Finance named the members to the Select Committee he was present. He did not object to it. As he said just now, he would wish to go back and seek his Party's approval. I think he has got to ask himself: is he here to represent the people, the people of Hougang, or is he here to represent his Party's CEC? Does he really need to seek his Party's approval to serve in the Select Committee? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Select Committees are part and parcel of the parliamentary process. It is part and parcel of Parliament. It is part and parcel of the debates, deliberations and proceedings we have here. It is not an appendage to Parliament. The Committees are set up to help in the deliberations of Parliament. They are very important and it is an important process of parliamentary democracy. I am therefore very disappointed that Mr Low decides not to serve in this Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has given several reasons. One reason is that he has objected to the Bill and, therefore, he should not serve. Does it, therefore, mean that any Member who objects to a Bill can refuse to serve in the Select Committee? Of course, the Member may have his views about a particular Bill \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> but that does not stop him from presenting those views even in the Select Committee. If he does not agree with the Select Committee's Report, there is again nothing to stop him from having a minority report in the Select Committee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Mr Chiam opposes many Bills. I also know that Mr Chiam was appointed by the Committee of Selection to serve on Select Committees. He has from time to time said that he has no time to do that, but he took his duties seriously. He took his duties seriously as the unofficial Leader of the Opposition. So he attended the Select Committee meetings and took part in them. I have sat with Mr Chiam on many Select Committees and I know he has played an active part. I had also hoped that Mr Low would take the same attitude, but alas, he did not. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low also quoted the example used in the British Parliament where before a Member is appointed to a Select Committee, the Whip is consulted. There is no Whip in the Workers' Party. Here, he is the only person. We have no such practice of consulting the Whip. We also have no such practice of consulting individual MPs, because we believe that every MP who is here takes his duties seriously. Therefore, whenever he is called upon to do so by the Committee of Selection, he will take part in the Select Committee. That is the assumption that we have always made on all our Members of Parliament, be he from the Opposition or from the Government Party. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Chinese saying goes, you can bring an ox to the water, but you cannot force the ox to drink. So since Mr Low so strenuously objects to sitting in the Select Committee, we can express our disappointment that he is not taking his duties seriously, but we cannot force him to be in the Select Committee. But I hope that he would not take the same position again in future when he is appointed to any Select Committee. I hope that he would represent the people's interest and not that of his party. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, I do not know why the Leader of the House should drag my name into this short debate. I hope he is not trying to divide the Opposition. I can assure him that he has to try very, very hard to divide the Opposition and he will not succeed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this principle of consultation, I notice that the Leader of the House has said that the PAP does not believe in consulting its Members before appointing them to any Select Committee. But I would certainly think that it would be better if each of the Members were asked first before he is put into certain Committees. They may have reasons of their own for not wanting to be in the Committee. If they are so obedient, as most PAP Members are, they may in fact in their heart reluctantly join in the Committee and not give of their best. Those people who are consulted and willingly accept the post will then certainly make a good job of it. I think it would be better if Members were consulted first. If not for anything else, I think it is out of sheer politeness. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other principle I want to point out is the freedom of choice. I think each Member should be given a freedom of choice whether or not he wants to be in any particular Committee and not be dragged into it. I notice the PAP's practice is not only applicable to selecting Members to Select Committees but in fact to most other matters concerning Members. For example, naming Members as delegates to go on a certain conference or seminar. The only time he knows he is selected is when he receives a notice with his name on it. Perhaps in this respect also, I think it would be better if Members were informed first. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know why Mr Wong should be so disappointed in Mr Low Thia Khiang not wanting to be in this Select Committee. There are 77 other PAP Members who can easily be selected. Anyone else can replace him. I do not see why he should be so disappointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Do you want to take his place? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I am in it already! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is improper for him to ask to be not included in the Committee. As I said, I think it is a question of freedom of choice. So I do not think it would be fair to allege that because the Member for Hougang does not want to be in the Select Committee, he is irresponsible. Try him in other Committees. I am sure he will make a good job of it and he will prove that he is not really irresponsible. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I want to bring up is about his loyalty, ie, whether it is loyalty to his party or to his constituents. I think he should be loyal to both. Because without his party, he would not be a Member of Parliament in any event. His party supported him and, as a result, the constituents voted him, and he is their representative. I think his loyalty and duty, in fact, are to both his party as well as his constituents. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you want to reply, Mr Low? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> On the point of consultation, Sir, I thank Mr Chiam for the answer. But I would like to add that, as a matter of courtesy, at least, I think, Members who are selected should be notified in advance, and their will be sought. As Mr Chiam has rightly pointed out, it is a question of will and freedom of choice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards my responsibility, I am aware of my responsibility as a Member of Parliament, and the fact that I did not object to sit on the Select Committee on the Land Titles Bill. The whole question here is not a question of responsibility or whether you force an ox to drink water. It is a question of taking a position. It is a question of principle. We have objected to the Bill very strongly and to show that there is a clear stand, I think it is wrong for me to be in the Select Committee. That will confuse the members of the public, and that is a matter of public interest. It is not a matter of selfishness and neither is it a matter of party interest. Let us face it. Any Member of the PAP can say that he represents the national interest, but he \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> should go against the PAP and vote against it if he thinks that a Bill or policy is not in the interest of the public. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Wong, do you want to make a clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Yes, Sir, with your indulgence. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of consultation, Mr Chiam was wrong to say that the PAP does not go around consulting. It is not the PAP that goes around appointing Members of the Select Committee. Parliament, at the beginning of every session, appoints a Committee of Selection. The Committee of Selection will then decide on the Members to sit on any Select Committee that is to be appointed. So it is not the PAP that is involved. Since we have Opposition parties in Parliament, it is only natural that, from time to time, it will have to include Members of the Opposition in the Select Committee. If not, they will say that all this is a PAP show. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we have included both of them, one has decided to opt out. Well, so be it. At least, we have made a point that we have not forgotten Mr Low of the Workers' Party. He is still in Parliament and there is also another party in Parliament, and he represents a segment of Singapore (Hougang people). Therefore, he should be in the Select Committee. But for some strange reasons, it is not a question of party loyalty, it is a question of what he believes in. It is not a question of freedom of choice either. By standing for election and coming into Parliament, you have undertaken to carry out all the duties that are assigned to you by Parliament. And when you are appointed to the Select Committee, it is the duty assigned to you by Parliament. Therefore, you ought not to opt out of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to answer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, on the question of belief. It is because I believe that GST is not good for the people that I objected to it and I do not want to sit in the Committee. The Select Committee cannot reject the Bill. It has already gone through the Second Reading stage in Parliament. You can only refine the Bill and, possibly, how to effectively implement GST. So it is incongruent and in conflict with the stand I have taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Committee of Selection, in the United Kingdom there is also such a Committee. I do not deny the fact that this Committee selects Members for parliamentary committees. But in the UK, though there is this Committee, in the process of selection, members are consulted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Mr Low Thia Khiang, the Member for Hougang, be discharged from the Select Committee on the Goods and Services Tax Bill. - [Mr Low Thia Khiang]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b>\n  </div> \n  <div align=\"center\">\n   <b>(Motion)</b>\n  </div> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chia has filed a motion* and before he seeks the general assent of the House to debate this motion, may I seek your consent and the general assent of Members present to move that the provisions of the Standing Orders be suspended to enable any Member, besides a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary, to speak for up to one hour to any question in Parliament under item 4 of the Order Paper today. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The motion reads as follows: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its concern over the allegation by Dr Chee Soon Juan that his dismissal from NUS for alleged misuse of his research funds amounting to a sum of $226.00 was politically motivated, and seeks clarification from the Minister for Education of the actual facts that caused Dr Chee's dismissal. \n  <hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" size=\"2\" noshade> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason is this.

I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses its concern over the allegation by Dr Chee Soon Juan that his dismissal from NUS for alleged misuse of his research funds amounting to a sum of $226.00 was politically motivated, and seeks clarification from the Minister for Education of the actual facts that caused Dr Chee's dismissal. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to you, Mr Speaker, Sir, and to the House for allowing the motion standing in my name to be debated. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 158</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole episode, like it or not, has been politicised and Parliament is the best place to debate on the issue. This matter of Dr Chee's dismissal is no longer a personal matter between him and the NUS. It has much wider implications and probably some political repercussions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee Soon Juan, an SDP candidate for the Marine Parade GRC by-election in December, came across to me, at least, as a very clever politician. He projected himself as David taking on the might of Goliath, the PAP. He projected himself as an underdog and even went ahead to compare himself to Cdre Teo Chee Hean, both being new members then. He talked about the promotion that Cdre Teo was to get and the sacrifices that he had to make and probably even the risk of losing his job as a lecturer in NUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, had dismissed his fears, saying that NUS would not fire him just because he is an Opposition candidate. Dr Chee had since, what the SDP has termed a sterling performance, been elected Assistant Secretary-General, second probably to Mr Chiam See Tong. Dr Chee had also written several critical letters of the Government to the press, and we read of several exchanges, which include Mr Matthias Yao's replies to his letters. And out of the blue, we suddenly read of Dr Chee's dismissal and then this saga. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee made a serious allegation that his dismissal was politically motivated. Everyone can see that he is a rising star on the Opposition camp and Dr Chee's boss was Dr Vasoo, a PAP MP. So his sudden dismissal did cause some concern amongst the public. Dr Chee had said many a time that he has a good brain. So using this good brain of his, he decided, and he said on his own accord, to go on a glucose-coated hunger strike. SDP had declared its 101% support for Dr Chee's honesty and integrity but said it did not influence him to go on a hunger strike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally, I cannot understand the rationale for his action, but, then, I am not a politician. [Interruptions.] I came in by the back-door, so some of us have said. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 159</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought there must be other better, perhaps, less dramatic, but certainly more effective ways to clear his name, if he is innocent. Maybe he has other reasons. One must always remember that Dr Chee has a good brain. Maybe he believes he can gain politically, shooting to national prominence, leapfrogging the popularity of even Mr Chiam See Tong and, perhaps, even Mr Goh Chok Tong. He had scheduled press conferences and interviews with even foreign press, including the Melbourne Age and probably even the BBC. So maybe he wants to go down in history, at least, in SDP's history book, as a martyr, a sacrificial lamb. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know his reasons. Maybe he is just simply tired of living and this might be a glamorous way to go. He has not even started the battle. So I wish him well, whatever his reasons are. Good luck to him. But if he wants an advice, I would like to say that dead heroes are no heroes. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not want to know his actual reasons. But what I want to know and, I believe, what the general public wants to know is the truth, simply the truth. Was he, as he claimed, victimised? He gave reasons to support that he did not act dishonestly in expending the $226. He claimed that his wife's thesis was relevant to his work. NUS was originally silent on this. Now, NUS has said that even if the work was relevant, she has no right to the funds. He claimed that Dr Vasoo had approved the expenses and had in fact shown invoices with Dr Vasoo's signatures. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDP's statement claimed that the issue of the research funds came up only after Dr Chee was questioned about his political motives or activities by Dr Vasoo and the Faculty Dean, Professor Ernest Chew, on 4th March. And there was this illegal taping that we read about and which Dr Vasoo was unhappy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other questions floated about are: (1) whether NUS rules on use of research funds are clear; (2) whether it is a practice \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of the academia to draw on research funds to send relevant thesis. Is this, even taking that Dr Chee was wrong, a dismissal offence? Were there precedents? And there are many, many more questions which I can leave them to the other hon. Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is important that we get the true picture to clear all doubts about the dismissal. We should not allow doubts to hang over our system of justice. We have, in fact, in this House just moved several Bills to improve the system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Leader of the House for lifting the Standing Orders to allow Members to speak up to one hour. I would also like to thank the Nominated MP, Mr Chia Shi Teck, for moving this motion but I thought he was, at times, in his speech a bit sarcastic. I would like to remind him that, as one who has been in Parliament for nearly nine years now, it is not wise to speak in that tone. If he wants the truth, I think that is a very honourable thing to ask for but, at the same time, I do not think he needs to ridicule Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Chee Soon Juan joined the SDP and took part in the Marine Parade GRC by-elections in December last year, the general public opinion was that his job as a neuropsychology lecturer in NUS was in jeopardy. Many people said that he shall surely be sacked. Public opinion is often self-prophesying. And sure enough, Dr Chee was not only sacked once but was sacked twice within a short space of less than one month. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, in his walkabout in Punggol last Sunday, had commented on Dr Chee's sacking. He said that it was a disciplinary action taken by an employer against a staff member. I believe the general public do not view it that way. Dr Chee is the first university lecturer in the last 25 years to join an Opposition party and contested in an election, not merely against any PAP Member but against the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Prime Minister and three others in a Group Representation Constituency. After the by-elections, he was featured in the press through his exchange of letters with the PAP and his name was mentioned in and out of Parliament for promoting the politics of envy. Dr Chee was not just an ordinary university lecturer and his abrupt termination of service cannot be viewed as just a straightforward employer-employee matter. The public see more into it than just that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also said, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'If Dr Chee is unhappy, he could easily ask for arbitration or bring up the matter in the court.' The fact is that it is unwise of Dr Chee to bring the matter to arbitration or to the courts. He shall surely lose his case. The reason is that Dr Chee's services were terminated in the first instance - by the way, he was terminated twice, so I say \"in the first instance\" - under clause 4(a) of his employment contract. Clause 4(a) is contractual in nature in that there is no element of fault attributed to Dr Chee. Clause 4(a) states that either party can give three months' notice and walk out of the contract. So it is purely contractual or, instead of notice, you could pay money in lieu of notice. So if Dr Chee went for arbitration, or to the courts, his application will not only be thrown out but he will have to suffer heavy costs because he has got no cause of action. It was just purely contractual. The university has the right to terminate him. Dr Chee has the right to walk out with three months' notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we must remember that the university, in terminating Dr Chee under clause 4(a), was exercising its contractual right. There is no dishonesty attached to that under clause 4(a). So in that sense, he cannot arbitrate or take his matter to the court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said that it is stupid of Dr Chee to go on a hunger strike to show that he was wrongly dismissed and to get the NUS to retract its allegation of dishonesty against him. May I ask the Prime Minister - he is not here today - in the circumstances, what options has Dr \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Chee? There is none. So he went on a hunger strike to highlight his plight. Is that stupid? I do not think so. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister was asked whether the NUS should reveal its past cases of disciplinary action against its staff. But he was reported to be against it. I am afraid that again public opinion is against him on this point. Many people, whom I spoke to, said that the NUS should reveal these facts. I call on the Minister for Education - I do not see him here also - to show whether they were of a similar nature to that of Dr Chee's case, or that they were materially different and could not be rightly equated to Dr Chee's case. The NUS cannot and should not insinuate that just because other lecturers were sacked for improper conduct, the NUS should do likewise to Dr Chee. The facts may be completely different. Until the NUS reveals the full facts, we shall never know. The lecturers who were sacked might have been really bad. Just because there were bad elements in the NUS previously, it cannot be concluded that Dr Chee is also bad. If the NUS takes that position, then it is behaving very irresponsibly and it does not speak well for such a prestigious institution. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall state the facts to show that Dr Chee's sacking as a lecturer in neuropsychology was politically motivated. At this point, it must be pointed out that Dr Vaspo, MP of the ruling Party, is also Dr Chee's immediate superior in the NUS. Dr Vasoo, at all material times, was wearing two hats, one as Dr Chee's Head of Department, and the other as a PAP MP. Can he objectively decide on this particular matter? Let the facts speak for itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee was recruited by NUS on 15th August 1990 for a two-year contract as a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Social Work and Psychology. After the first year, he had no trouble getting a promotion as a lecturer for a three-year term, backdated to the date of the first contract as he was a good lecturer, he did his work very well and was very productive in his research work. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of 1990, and in early 1991, Dr Chee wrote on three occasions to the Straits Times, criticising the Singapore Government policy on the early streaming of children in primary schools. Dr Vasoo, as mentioned above, the Head of the Department, who is also an MP, came to Dr Chee's office and, in an apparently friendly manner, advised him not to write such letters. Dr Chee also came to understand that Dr Vasoo spoke to one of his colleagues, Anthony Chen, asking him to get Dr Chee to stop writing. I shall prepare all the letters that were written by Dr Chee to the press and other documents and make them available to Members later. I will hand these documents over to the Librarian to make copies for Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee did not heed Dr Vasoo's advice. And in 1991, he wrote again to the press criticising aspects of the 'A' level system. That time, Dr Vasoo called Dr Chee into his office and, in a formal manner, informed him, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That every letter Dr Chee wrote would count against him.' Dr Vasoo did not elaborate what he meant. Later in that year, Dr Chee wrote to the press to criticise statements made by Dr Ong Chit Chung, another PAP MP, on a study of Singaporean values. Dr Vasoo again called Dr Chee into his office and asked him why he had written to the media when he could have written instead to Dr Ong directly. Dr Vasoo asked Dr Chee not to continue. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One evening, on or about the later half of 1990, Dr Chee received a lift from Dr Vasoo. During the drive, Dr Chee asked casually what would happen to a NUS lecturer if he joined an Opposition party. Dr Vasoo replied that he would probably be sacked, or asked to resign. In December 1992, Dr Chee took part as one of the SDP's candidates in the Marine Parade GRC by-elections. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early this year, the Department of Social Work and Psychology carried out its annual review of work done by its members. During the review, which was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> conducted by Dr Vasoo, he asked Dr Chee about an interview he gave to The Ridge, a students' magazine published by the NUS, and he expressed his disapproval of Dr Chee's comments. This interview can also be found in the bundle of documents that will be made available to Members. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February and March of this year, there was a fierce exchange of letters between Dr Chee, writing in the capacity as the Assistant Secretary-General of the SDP, on the one part, and Mr Matthias Yao, the Second Organising Secretary of the PAP, on the other part. Before the correspondence between Dr Chee and Mr Matthias Yao could complete, Dr Chee, on 4th March 1993, was summoned to the office of Dr Vasoo, and also present, was Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Science. Instead of talking about the work of Dr Chee, he was asked about the statements he made during the by-election campaign when Dr Chee commented on the absurdity in the Singapore State controlled education system whereby he had not been able to secure a place as an undergraduate at NUS but, several years later, had been appointed to the teaching staff. Dr Chee was also asked about the interview he had given to Asiaweek, a regional weekly, and The Ridge, the students' magazine referred to earlier, and Dr Chee was told that his statements were invidious. All those questions put to Dr Chee had no relevance whatsoever to his university work but were all political in nature. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo then questioned Dr Chee about the two parcels he had sent in September and November 1992 to Pennsylvania State University. Those parcels had been paid for on Dr Chee's research postage account which was part of the research grant from NUS and contained the PhD dissertation of his wife, Dr Huang Chih-Mei. Dr Vasoo asked Dr Chee to give a written explanation. Dr Chee gave his written explanation on the same day, ie, 4th March 1993. The letter was addressed to Dr Vasoo, the Head of his Department. Despite explaining that he felt justified in using university funds to send his wife's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dissertation because it had relevance to his own research work, Dr Chee was dismissed from his lectureship post. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now talk about the letter of dismissal. The letter of dismissal was dated 18th March 1993 and I read it. I felt that it was one of the most biased letters I have read. In the letter, the word \"admitted\" was used four times when the proper word in the context of the subject matter should be \"told\", or \"said\", or \"revealed\". The word \"admitted\" is very emotive. It implies that a person has told some untruth and later on he admitted to the fact that he had told an untruth. But in the case of Dr Chee, there is nothing to admit. The word \"admitted\" was used three times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Four times. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Four times, yes. The letter accused Dr Chee of dishonesty or lack of honesty three times. And yet the termination was made under clause 4 of the agreement for service which is contractual in nature. I have already explained this. Either party can give three months' notice to terminate the contract, not based on clause 4(c) where the University can terminate a staff immediately because of misconduct. It was not done under clause 4(c). If the University really thought Dr Chee was guilty of dishonesty, then, as I have mentioned, he should have been terminated forthwith, but it was not done. If the real reason for terminating his service was not for dishonest conduct, then one can only surmise that it was for political reasons. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is useful for me to read this letter to you written by one of the University staff. I will not mention his name. I understand that he is a lawyer by training. I have the letter in front of me. I will just read to you paragraph 5. It states: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In your letter dated 4th March 1993, you said you wanted the results of your wife's dissertation quickly reviewed, validated and subsequently incorporated into your research. But you suppressed the material fact that you have in fact sent your wife's papers for the purpose of her PhD examination.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph 6 states: \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Only at the next meeting on 11th March 1993 when I was present did you admit that you had used University research funds to send your wife's dissertation to Pennsylvania State University for the purpose of her PhD examination. But you nevertheless maintained that this was in order because your wife's dissertation contained materials relevant to your own research.' There are two points there. One is that the writer of this letter accuses Dr Chee of suppressing or not telling him that the materials in the parcels had to do with his wife's PhD examination. But Dr Chee did not suppress or hide anything. In his letter of explanation of 4th March, he came out very forthrightly and said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In this instance, I used the funds for the above-mentioned purpose to enhance the chances of getting my research published. To the best of my judgement, I feel that I am justified in using the funds in my research accounts for mailing the completed dissertation to the university involved so that the results could be quickly reviewed and validated, and subsequently incorporated into my own research.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the word \"dissertation\" first. Obviously, the University authorities still need English lessons. They do not know what is the meaning of \"dissertation\". To Dr Chee, it is very clear. \"Dissertation\" means materials for PhD examination. I looked up the Penguin dictionary, 2nd edition, it states: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`dissertation - discourse or treaties on a particular subject especially one written as a requirement for a university degree.' What else can Dr Chee say? This is like a person telling this University chap, \"I am going to send a gun to America in one of your courier service parcels.\" Then later on when he discovered it was a gun, he says, \"How come you never tell me it was a weapon for destruction, for killing people?\" It is the same. It is so obvious to the person. A handgun is for killing and for causing grievous hurt. I do not have to tell you that I was sending a weapon, you know, with bullets inside and can kill people. When he says \"dissertation\", it is understood. It is for examination purposes. But here this writer says that he suppressed materials. I really cannot understand. You see the biased nature of this letter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point he makes is that Dr Chee was dishonest in also not telling \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> them that the materials that he sent was relevant to his research. Let us look at the reasoning of this writer. Paragraph 7 says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`First you suppressed information that it was expenditure for examination of your wife's PhD. After you admitted this, you nevertheless claimed it was justified because it was to incorporate into your research. But you had made no arrangement for any persons in Pennsylvania State University who were experts in your own area of research to review the results in your wife's dissertation. The members of the dissertation committee of your wife's PhD had nothing to do with your research. They were not concerned with incorporating your wife's research results into your work. Therefore, this claim that it was for incorporation into your research was not honest.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This writer, in rejecting Dr Chee's appeal, also wrote these words: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Your appeal has been considered. Your argument that you are justified to use University funds is convoluted and devious and has no merit whatsoever.' It is a very aggressive way of rejecting an appeal. I do not think even the Judges in court use this type of language to dismiss an appeal. But, nevertheless, he uses the words \"convolated and devious\". \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Convoluted. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Convoluted. Much obliged. I want to use these same words against the writer in this paragraph. Did you understand what I read just now? I am sure you do not. I have to read it two or three times to understand what he means. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> You are slow. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> All right, you say I am slow. You tell me what is the meaning of that. I am sure you cannot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, he wants a panel of experts in Pennsylvania University who understands Dr Chee's research work to examine Mrs Chee's work. That is what he wants. In other words, before Dr Chee could send his parcel to America, he has got to write to Pennsylvania State University, which is a stranger to him as it is not his own university, seek out some people over there, whether they know or are familiar with his work. Then he should get them to examine his wife's research paper to see whether there is any relevance between the two. But Dr Chee has made it clear. He \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> wanted the material quickly validated and sent back to him. He was anxious to get on with his work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is a statement of fact. The panel of experts in Pennsylvania University who has something to do with his wife's PhD dissertation, of course, did not know that the wife's work was to be incorporated into Dr Chee's work. That is what he says. From these statements, he concluded that Dr Chee was dishonest. Because of his dishonest conduct, he was accordingly dismissed under clause 4(a). \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reasoning is also twisted. If Dr Chee was really dishonest, then he should have been dismissed under clause 4(c), but instead under clause 4(a) which is contractual in nature. I think if this matter is brought to court, the writer would have difficulty defending his position. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the letter that was sent to dismiss Dr Chee. You make up your minds whether or not the dismissal was politically motivated. The crux of the matter is whether or not the wife's research work has any relevance to his own work. He took the trouble to fax letters to his own university, the University of Georgia, to get one of his Professors there to give an opinion. The Minister is not here. I would like to give him a copy. Who will be answering in place of the Minister? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, would you like to hand it over to me and I can arrange for copies to be circulated to Members? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. [Copy of letter handed to the Clerk of Parliament.] \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This letter is written by George W. Hynd, Research Professor, Director, Center for Clinical &amp; Developmental Neuropsychology, Clinical Professor of Neurology. It says: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Dear Soon-Juan: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received your letter of April 8, 1993 and am somewhat surprised that anyone would question the relevance of these two research papers. You may recall that you sent me the reviews and manuscript abstracts (and additional manuscript pages) to read. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, you and I have previously communicated about research along these lines because I have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> previously published a number of studies addressing the importance of age, racial, sex, and cultural differences in neuropsychological development. These articles have been widely published and cited and as I recall you were going to follow-up with studies of your own there in Singapore. From the two papers you sent me it looks like you did follow-up and investigated supra-modal functioning in different cultural groups. The fact that differences are found supports the growing consensus that cultural effects do impact on evolving neurocognitive and sensory systems in children and these effects may very well manifest temperamentally as well. This is underscored by the second manuscript you sent me. The two papers are highly relevant to each other in this regard. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I view your line of research as very important and cannot understand why there is confusion about the importance of these studies. They clearly provide sound data that can and should be published (I would suggest submitting your research to Developmental Neuropsychology). Your research also provides a solid rationale to continue to examine the effects of culture on neuropsychological test performance as it will lead to a better understanding of the development of brain-behavior relations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please keep me updated on your research. Sgd. George W. Hynd' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this letter, it is conclusive that the wife's work and his work had relevance. Sir, the University has sacked Dr Chee unfairly without even taking the trouble to find out whether there is any connection, any link, between his wife's PhD thesis and his own research work. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already commented on the letter of dismissal. Then things developed very fast. On or about 1.45 pm on Saturday, 10th April 1993, the University sent one of its staff to hand a letter to Dr Chee at his home. That letter again sacked Dr Chee on the spot. But, surprisingly, the reasons given in that letter had nothing to do with the alleged dishonest conduct of Dr Chee. The University had shifted its ground and now says that he was behaving improperly because he has made instigation against the University by going on a hunger strike, by urging the SDP to put pressure on the University and probably by his general remarks. So what does it show? It shows that Dr Chee was never dishonest at any time. Now he is dismissed not on the grounds of dishonesty. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that letter, the University contended that even if Dr Chee's wife's thesis has relevance - now they are slowly admitting it - to Dr Chee's research work, it was still improper to use University fund to send his wife's dissertation to Pennsylvania State University. All this sounds very strange. If it was really improper, they should have punished him on the spot. The first parcel was sent on 8th September 1992, the second parcel was despatched about 9th November 1992, and action was only taken on or about 4th March. So there is a time gap of six months in one case, and four months in the other case. If he was really that dishonest, why did they wait until such a long time later? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also comments about the procedure of using University funds. If a lecturer gives a treat to a friend with a University grant, is it proper or not proper? The University will probably say it is not proper. If he were an SDP Member, they will straightaway try to find fault and get him out. But you have to look at the circumstances. The person whom he gave a big dinner treat or a lunch treat may help him in his research. You have to find out the facts first. You cannot just straightaway say, \"Well, because it was not used for his own purpose but used for somebody's else, he is dishonest.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have looked through the documents and what are the rules and regulations governing use of research fund? I have here one document on the University's Terms and Conditions of Grant. I believe paragraph 5 is relevant. It reads: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Bills and Claims for payments must be certified by the principal investigator and approved by the Head of his Department before they are submitted to the Bursar's Office for payment. The vote chargeable and the item No. must be indicated. Only original copies of the bills are accepted for payment.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we know, Dr Chee has complied with this condition. His bills comprising delivery notes and invoices were obviously checked by the principal investigator and approved personally by Dr Vasoo himself. Then they were sent to the Bursar. Payments were made. The whole matter was over because it was \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> duly approved by the Head of Department. As far as we know, with regard to the two parcels, the matter was already closed. Suddenly, six months later, we find that people were trying to dig out to find out whether or not those parcels contained relevant materials to his research. We can only ask why. It is quite obvious. The person who dug it out to find out what were inside the parcels was obviously trying to find fault with Dr Chee. There is no other reason. It cannot be for accounting purposes because the Head of Department had already cleared it and it was in order. So once the auditors find that the procedures are in order, they would not go and find out and ask what is inside the parcel. I have made enquiries of accountants and no auditors would do that. So we can only conclude other motives. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chia has mentioned this procedure with regard to use of research funds. There are no other guidelines and no other detailed procedures to guide Dr Chee. So if there are any gray areas, what is he supposed to do? Is he supposed to take the advice of the University authorities in that letter to write to his University or other people's University, get a Committee to find out whether that is relevant and then he can send. But that is not stated anywhere in these procedures. So as far as Dr Chee is concerned, he has complied with the procedure and yet he is in trouble. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the invoices. These are also material matters. I am made to understand that when Dr Vasoo signed these materials, two pieces of papers were given to them. One was the invoice and the other was the delivery note. On the invoice itself, the addressee is clearly shown there, the name and the destination are also shown there, and the amount. On the delivery note, written very clearly, anyone who signs this would note that on the left hand side were the details of Dr Chee Soon Juan, and on the right were the names of the persons whom this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> parcel was to be sent to. Why did Dr Vasoo, as the Head of Department, not make enquiry at that particular point of time? He cleared it despite the fact that he knows all these particulars in the invoices and in the delivery notes. How can you put the blame on Dr Chee? If Dr Chee is dishonest, then I think Dr Vasoo is abetting and aiding the dishonesty. He signed it. He cleared it. These invoices are all similar in nature. So can you say that Dr Chee was dishonest? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interesting point is this. At one time when Dr Chee asked for the invoices, you can see for yourself that Dr Vasoo gave this invoice with half the bottom blanked out. If Dr Vasoo is in the House today, we should ask him to explain why? Why does he want to suppress materials on the other half. The most relevant part that was hidden off contained his own signature and notes made there, Dr Chee Soon Juan's RT account No. 92009 - $74.50. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to this matter of using University funds, I think it is incumbent on the University to prove that Dr Chee has in fact breached the rules and regulations in the use of the University Grant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this incident of the tape recorder. I do not know why Dr Vasoo wants to bring up this matter of the tape recorder. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is an upright man, as he alleges, then there is nothing to worry. Everything that is in the tape recorder would only prove that he is an upright person. Why should he be so concerned? Dr Chee has already explained. He has already announced that he wanted to take part in the elections and it is only prudent, as a politician, for future records, of any accusation made against him, then he would have proof, and his fears in fact have come true. I do not think it was improper in the circumstances because politics is a serious matter and we do not know what kind of accusations can be made against him. So I would ask Dr Vasoo to in fact release the tape and let the House know what are the contents of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> the tape. Because I am sure he has got nothing to fear, and let us not insinuate into the matter. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the University rightly should have done was to appoint an independent committee, people who are knowledgeable on the matter and to examine all the theses and all of Dr Chee's research papers and see whether there is any relevance. He has written many research papers. I can see the whole list of them when I read through the papers. That is what any objective, unbiased person would do. But instead, they just jumped the gun and without any concrete evidence accused him of dishonesty. So I hope the Leader of the House would lift the Whip so that Members could vote from the evidence that they have heard and not be bound by the decision of the Whip. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> May I seek a clarification? On this particular letter from the University of Georgia, could I ask Mr Chiam to give us the letter by Dr Chee to this particular Professor? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I said I will make available all these papers. Can I sit down and sort out these papers? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

Mr Cheo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen (Nee Soon Central)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Chee Soon Juan has been dismissed recently and this dismissal has led to his going on a hunger strike. This incident has attracted wide public attention. I do not like to defend any party involved. But in the public interest I feel it is necessary for me to speak on the dismissal of Dr Chee by the University authority. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee and the National University of Singapore should know what they are doing. Dr Chee feels that his dismissal by the University is due to his participation in \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> politics in the Opposition. It is because of political reasons that the University accused him of dishonesty and terminated his contract of employment. We do not want to go into the merit or demerit of the case for the time being. What I am concerned with now is whether the University has any political bias. Are the University staff allowed to take part in politics or not? Can a staff member of the University express his views to the press? Here, I would like to quote what Dr Chee has told me. Just now, Mr Chiam See Tong has made some reference to it. I would like to remind the University authority to ensure its neutrality in politics. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee told me that before he joined the Singapore Democratic Party, one evening he took a lift from Dr Vasoo in his car and he asked Dr Vasoo that if a lecturer joined an opposition party what would happen to him. Dr Vasoo said he could either be dismissed or be asked to resign. That was what he said. If Dr Vasoo did say such things to Dr Chee, then we have reason to be worried that the dismissal of Dr Chee was possibly politically motivated. I feel that as the Head of Department, Dr Vasoo should come forward, confirm or explain what he has said. I would also ask the Minister for Education to express his views on this matter. \n  <br>2.30 pm \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar GRC)</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to the motion standing in the name of the Nominated Member, Mr Chia Shi Teck, I have the following views to present. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Cheo Chai Chen spoke just now, I thought at first that they would be bringing up some fresh points to defend Dr Chee Soon Juan. However, having heard what they have said, I am beginning to understand why Dr Chee Soon Juan had to spend so much time to consider whether or not he should instruct Mr Chiam See Tong to be his lawyer. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged misuse of NUS research funds and the misconduct of Dr Chee Soon Juan had led to his dismissal by the NUS. My view is that this is a disciplinary action by the employer (NUS) against its employee (Dr Chee Soon Juan). So this is a matter between the employer and the employee. Anyone who is not satisfied can easily settle the dispute through legal means. As the saying goes, \"There are national laws in a country and there are house rules in a family.\" This solemn Parliament should discuss national affairs and issues concerning the life and death of our citizens. This is not a place to settle the dispute between the individual and the organisation, or a place to solve their grievances and petty matters. Unfortunately, Dr Chee Soon Juan's case has been politicised by Mr Chiam See Tong and the SDP, and this has dragged Parliament into this dispute between Dr Chee and the University. The truth will speak for itself! \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a moment and think about the matter. If Dr Chee did not misuse the research funds and had not done any act of dishonesty, then why should the NUS dismiss him? The statement from SDP is indirectly saying that the dismissal is due to Dr Chee's involvement in the Opposition party. If we condone this, then we would be protecting those people who are making use of political means to better themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP has said that this action against Dr Chee Soon Juan was initiated because he joined the Opposition party. Maybe Mr Chiam See Tong believes that someone who has got a PhD and who can write articles in the newspaper would be a great asset to his party. In fact, the articles written by Dr Chee Soon Juan would, at best, be good enough to mislead some Singaporeans. Most of us in Singapore are very clear about the matter and will not be easily fooled by him. The truth will speak for itself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong should review the selection criteria of his \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> party candidates. Why is he so lenient in his selection process? If the SDP believes that this meagre sum of $226 is only a small amount, then they are wrong. Because the SDP should know that in running a town council, it would involve millions of dollars. If he can be tempted by this small amount of $226, then what about $2.26 million or $22.6 million? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Peh, are you giving way? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua:</b> No. (In Mandarin) Let me finish my speech, then he could speak. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Peh is not giving way. Mr Chiam, could you resume your seat? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): If a person is not honest and has no integrity, then how can he not yield to such a great temptation? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been a member of the People's Action Party for 20 years. To the best of my knowledge, once the Central Executive Committee of the PAP finds any member to be dishonest, it would immediately sack the member, rather than protecting and supporting him. I do not know why Mr Chiam See Tong has chosen to divert the attention of the people away from Dr Chee Soon Juan's act of dishonesty in order to cover up for his mistakes in selecting a wrong party candidate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, if Dr Chee Soon Juan is truly innocent, then as the Assistant Secretary-General of the SDP, he could instruct the two lawyers in SDP (his Chairman, Mr Ling How Doong, and Secretary-General, Mr Chiam See Tong) to represent him. As Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Ling How Doong are the paramount leaders in the party, they are in the best position to represent Dr Chee Soon Juan. But from the statement issued by SDP, we can see that Mr Chiam See Tong should be very willing to do so. However, until today, neither Dr Chee Soon Juan nor Mr Chiam See Tong has done so. Is it because \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Dr Chee Soon Juan has no confidence in these two lawyers in the SDP? Mr Chiam See Tong said just now - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Peh, are you giving way to Mr Chiam? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua:</b> No. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, please be seated. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope that Mr Chiam See Tong would be patient. He will have the chance to speak later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong said just now that Dr Chee Soon Juan will surely lose his case if legal action is taken. Is it because Dr Chee Soon Juan has realized that he was wrong in the first place, if the matter is brought up to the court and the whole matter is exposed, and it would be even more difficult for him to turn back? Hence, he adopted the naive and ridiculous way of hunger strike to gain public sympathy. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the Forum page of The Straits Times on 7th April 1993, the significance of hunger strike between the late Indian politician Mr Gandhi and that of Dr Chee Soon Juan is entirely different. The hunger strike by Gandhi concerned the nation and the people, whereas Dr Chee Soon Juan is merely trying to hide the truth and to divert the attention of his people to boost his political popularity. The most comical part is that Dr Chee Soon Juan had taken a heavy breakfast before commencing his hunger strike. Then he has been feeding himself on glucose water. From the newspaper report, I see that he has placed a big bed in the comfort of his living room. It looks as though he is enjoying his leave, much to the envy of many people. This naive and ridiculous method of hunger strike is certainly different to the hunger strike of the great Gandhi who sat in an open space before the people. The worst part is that his attitude of stubbornly refusing to admit his mistake has gained the support \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> of Mr Chiam See Tong and the SDP, and has developed the whole incident into a political event to exert pressure on the University. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can you please resume your seat? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> resumed his seat. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Chiam has spent a lot of time talking just now. He should be patient. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the support of Mr Chiam See Tong and SDP, he has exerted pressure on the NUS to withdraw its allegation against him and to develop the whole incident into a political event. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know whether the two SDP Opposition MPs are aware of the full details of Dr Chee Soon Juan's story. Or could it be that they are still in the dark and knowing only half the truth? Otherwise, why have they not represented Dr Chee Soon Juan through legal means to take up a libel suit against the NUS? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind the SDP MPs that Parliament is a solemn place to discuss national affairs and matters of life and death of our citizens. This is not a court. Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Ling How Doong are lawyers. They should not lead the members of the legal profession in Singapore to believe that the SDP has ignored the existence of judges and lawyers. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, can I remind you that you have spoken on the motion? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> No. I want a clarification from the Member. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. I will allow you only to seek a brief clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes. I have got several clarifications to get from Mr Peh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, does Mr Peh realise that, in the first instance, Dr Chee was dismissed on \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> contractual grounds? Does he know that? I want to ask him, if he is better than a lawyer, whether, if he was dismissed on contractual grounds, he would go to court. I want a clarification from him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He alleges that Dr Chee has committed a dishonest act. Can he please clarify and name the rule or regulation, or term and condition, of the University in which he has breached to say that he has committed a dishonest act? He says that, again, Dr Chee is ridiculous, going on hunger strike, sleeping on a bed, having glucose drink, and having a big breakfast before he starts. I will put a challenge to him. Any time, if he wants a hunger strike, challenge with Dr Chee! He will take Mr Peh on any time. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I will not be so comical as to go on a hunger strike like Dr Chee Soon Juan. I will not be so stupid to make myself a clown in Singapore to gain public sympathy. If I were Dr Chee Soon Juan, I would employ a good lawyer like Mr Chiam See Tong to defend me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ling, have you decided to speak? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Yes. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Would you change your mind? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> No. I would not, because my name has been mentioned. I think I have a right to reply. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel sorry for Mr Peh. I suppose that is his usual style of speech-reading, instead of speech-making here. From what I have seen, he must have prepared his speech. In a parliamentary debate, when someone has made a speech of facts, you should modify your reply. It would appear he cannot do it. He was just repeating what he has written. We have never raised in this House the question of $226 used by Dr Chee. He has even failed to understand what we have \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> been saying, ie, if Dr Chee has been guilty of dishonesty, why in the letter of dismissal it cited clause 4(a), which is a contractual provision in the contract. Why? He apparently does not even understand simple English, I suppose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Sit down! Let me finish first. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> I must remind you that you are not in a position to ask any Member to sit down. That is for me to decide. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> I apologise. He has not even got your permission and he starts to interrupt and speak. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is for me to make the ruling. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> I will bear that in mind, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before you continue, I would like to say something. I must inform the strangers in the Gallery that they must be on proper behaviour at all times and they are not to indulge in clapping of any form or to interrupt the proceedings of this House. If there are any further interruptions, I shall direct the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove the strangers. You may continue, Mr Ling. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> Thank you for your indulgence, Sir. Mr Peh spoke after Mr Chiam has given his views. He should direct his answers or his speech to what has been raised in this House. He has been raising something extraneous from what he has read from the newspaper. Is it right for him to do this? And he has unnecessarily dragged me into the whole thing when I have not even spoken at all. It looks to me that he is going to secure cheap publicity here. The point raised by him is not in dispute, as we have never, at any time, said that because the amount is small, the University should overlook it. We have never said this. Our thrust is this. There is no dishonesty. It is immaterial whether it is $200 or $2 million. So what is the point of him saying \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that \"Well, because it is a small amount, we should condone it, bigger amount then, perhaps, action should be taken.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point here is that the University is not taking action against Dr Chee for dishonesty. They have shifted ground. The first letter of termination stated it was dishonesty by not revealing the fund and how it was being used. We have already made our point here. It is immaterial how the fund was being used. The point here is whether the fund used was relevant to his research. There are no proper guidelines as to how research funds are to be used and, in this particular case, Dr Chee had used it in his own judgement which was not only relevant but also backed up by one professor who said it was very relevant. So therefore the question of misuse of the fund is no more there. I really do not understand why the Member could dig up something and point an accusing finger that we are backing somebody or we have been misled by somebody. He should reply to what has been raised in this House. It is a proper thing for him to do rather than to bark at everybody wrongly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, let me clarify this point. This is Parliament. This is not a mass rally. Mr Ling How Doong has even brought his cheer leaders here to applaud him. I am very disappointed. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Ling How Doong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Ling How Doong:</b> I am objecting to his insinuation that I bring in my cheer leaders here. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ling, you speak only when I recognise you. Mr Peh, you have already participated in the debate. I can only allow you to respond, but very briefly. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(\n  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, Mr Chiam See Tong has already politicised the whole matter. Since he has politicised the matter, I have to clarify the matter. My colleague, Dr Vasoo, should be telling us the full facts of the matter later, so I think Mr Chiam See Tong should wait for the reply by the Minister for Education. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Just now, Mr Ling How Doong remarked about the mention of $226. If he had listened carefully to me in Chinese just now, he would have realized that I used the word \"if\". \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Brickworks GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on this motion in the name of the hon. NMP, Mr Chia Shi Teck. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to what the previous hon. Member has to speak, I find that it is so much easier to follow the points and the logic of my Parliamentary colleague, Mr Peh, than to listen and follow the convoluted logic and questions of the hon. Member for Bukit Gombak. And it seems very surprising to me that Parliament today should be really debating on this issue which, as rightly pointed out by my Parliamentary colleague, pertains to the affairs of an individual involved in an employer-employee contractual problem. But, however, as in the nature of a democracy, any problems can be made political if a party or a person chooses to. It may as well be so that people will be clear about the issues and not let sentiments and emotions get the upper hand of logic and orderly thinking. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is that Dr Chee Soon Juan, a lecturer from the NUS, has been dismissed for alleged misuse of research funds by the employer, the NUS. If the lecturer concerned feels that he has been wronged, then he should take legal redress. I can think of at least two Members here who are qualified and able to represent him. The NUS being the employer is most willing for the employee to seek arbitration and legal redress as provided for in the terms of the contract, if the other party feels it has been wronged. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, it is strange that Dr Chee has not chosen the rightful and the lawful way of rectifying this alleged wrong. His Chairman and Secretary-General in the Party are both lawyers and they have been taking great pains to point out to the House why they cannot represent him in this issue. But I really believe that the matter pertains to arbitration, or to the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> court, and not to this House. I am sure they are willing and they are ably qualified to do so, particularly as the dismissal as alleged is supposed to be politically motivated. That would have given the leaders of the SDP the platform and the avenue to clear the matter once and for all for Singapore and the world to see. Yet this sensible avenue was not chosen. Why? Instead, Dr Chee has chosen to go on a half hunger strike with glucose. This is the real politically motivated part. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the psychologist he is, he is deliberately politicising the situation so as to impugn the responsibility for his dismissal to some political motivation by some powers that be. Who? He has not specified. This is a clever art done by psychologists all the time, the redirection of feelings, emotions and desires towards another object. It is called transference. Religious fanatics and false prophets also practise the psychological game to influence and control their followers by self-inflicted denials, always in the public light but never in the cloister of one's retreat and never in the loneliness of the desert. The practitioner of this art portrays himself as the one suffering for humanity, the one to bring the new joy and freedom, the one without sin admits all the sinners. Hence, a bed from the bedroom was placed in the sitting room, with a few pillows to bear, and a daily press conference is an essential. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a politician, Dr Chee is true to his colour. True enough, as identified by our Prime Minister sometime ago, he is playing the politics of envy once again. He is polarising the politics of envy on to himself, invoking on himself as a torch-bearer for the long suffering Singaporeans that he purports to champion. This is a sordid attempt at deluding the people to camouflage the political underhand. By doing so, naturally he hopes to serve his own purpose, which is to cloud the issue of his misconduct, to attract media attention for his own political goal. Naturally, he hopes to build \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> up himself as a political martyr and to turn his problems to political advantage and make political capital out of it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the SDP, in its press release, has implicitly admitted that this action of Dr Chee is calculated for political advantage. I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The SDP would not ask any person to endanger his health or life for any political advantage. (Signed Chiam See Tong)' However, I believe that Singaporeans are not so easily swayed. If they were, more than 70% of Singaporeans would not have voted for the PAP in the last by-election where Dr Chee took part and failed. Yet, if it is necessary, it must be pointed out that these desperate political moves are not something that should be tolerated and Singaporeans should not be fooled and taken for a ride by it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contractual agreement between NUS and Dr Chee should properly be respected as dealing between an employer and an employee, and best left to themselves to sort it out. Unfortunately, since the matter has been brought to the House, in the nature of a democracy, Members must have their say, perhaps, this was meant to be so by the person in question. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a little bit for the NUS in this instance. Sir, I have no interest in the NUS, or the NUS in me. However, as a former research scholar in the University of Singapore who had benefitted from the research awards from the University, I must say that I have a healthy respect for the University. From its antecedent days of the University of Singapore, it has grown into the present National University of Singapore. I dare say one of the best universities in the world. There are hundreds of lecturers with PhDs from all over the world with all sorts of political ideas and beliefs at the NUS. It expends hundreds of millions of dollars annually. We must give some respect to the University administration for its decision-making on how to run the University, or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> deal with its staff and how to set the rules. Any person believed to be wrong can naturally seek the proper lawful redress. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a very civilised society. Millions of dollars are given out each year from the University for approved research topics. Not all the research money can be guaranteed to be fruitful, but none should be dishonestly spent. This is the basic trust between agencies funding out research grants and recipients. The terms of application are always spelt out. Let the people responsible for it handle and deal with it. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion seeks clarification from the Minister for Education. I am sure this will be forthcoming. But we must not play into Dr Chee's hands. It is not the facts he is after. He knows the facts and they are against him. He has already made the choice. It is the emotion that he is after. I urge Singaporeans not to let themselves be drawn into this mini-attempt psycho drama created by Dr Chee to achieve his own narrow political objective. Let the problem Dr Chee has with the University be resolved between themselves, as it lawfully should be, and no one should exploit Dr Chee's problem to political advantage. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add a little bit on what I know of the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar, Dr Vasoo, the Head of the Social Work and Psychology Department. He is unfortunately the Head of Dr Chee in this Department. I am sure Dr Vasoo will, in good time, furnish information to the House as to what exactly happened. I know Dr Vasoo for many years, more than a decade, even before he and I entered Parliament. He is a highly-principled man, who has always been serving and representing the poor and the underprivileged in society, and I have sat with him for years in the Public Assistance Review Committee which reviews all appeals for public assistance cases brought up by MPs. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I marvel at his tenacity in putting forward the case for the poor and the underprivileged of society. He is the MP \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> who fights for the poor and pushes for their well-being actively and quietly in numerous committees and meetings and publicly in Parliament on numerous occasions. He is the man who speaks for and serves the poor and the underprivileged, not Dr Chee. He has not just got a good brain, he has got a good heart. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, the present motion in the name of the NMP is too ambiguous and I cannot support it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

I am really disappointed that an academic matter like this is turned into a political issue. It is really unfortunate, Sir, because I did not expect a turn of such an event.

I have nothing to hide.

Members as well as the public to come to their own conclusion, whether Dr Chee's conduct was right or wrong. I think this is very crucial, Sir, and Members need to examine the way that I am going to present the facts. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak more in sorrow than in anger, because he was a staff of mine. I have nurtured him. I have supported him. I have given him the best possible, but he was trying to play politics. That I discovered later. Despite all that, I took no advantage of that. The House may not know it, but it was I who recommended that Dr Chee be appointed as a Teaching Fellow in my Department, the Department of Social Work and Psychology. The University was not keen to appoint him because Dr Chee has poor 'O' and 'A' level results. But I argued for his appointment, because I felt that young people like him who have made it, who have tried hard, be given a chance in our society. That is why I persuaded the selection board to give him an opportunity within the University to work. Otherwise, he would not have an opportunity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issues are whether Dr Chee had misused University research funds amounting to $226 to send his wife's dissertation for her PhD examination, and then dishonestly misled the University in its investigations. I think the crucial issue is that he sent his wife's dissertation for examination. And we need not be side-tracked by all other things. The others are all peripherals. The central issue is this: did he or did he not? And I will prove that he has, in fact, used University funds to send his wife's thesis for examination. And I state that it is his wife's PhD dissertations which were sent. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee was first appointed as a Teaching Fellow on 15th August 1990 and then confirmed as a Lecturer in August 1991. I argued for him because I thought that this young man was energetic, was working hard. I persuaded the Vice Chancellor to convert him from a Teaching Fellow to a Lecturer within 14 months, but the University decided not to do so. They said, \"Assess him for a longer time.\" So, sometime after the 14th or 15th month, I persuaded the University to make him a Lecturer. The University got persuaded and he became a Lecturer retrospective from the time he was employed. It is not that I was vindictive. I thought that he had done his job well. I recognised it and gave my recommendations. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been Head of the Department since 1986 and as part of my responsibility, I have to submit reports on the work of 37 teaching staff and the use of all funds allocated by the University to the Department. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are given to staff to undertake research, to buy equipment, and these are people with integrity and who would have to be accountable for the funds for which they are given. These are all public funds and therefore they have to be accountable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Chee came on 7th December 1992 to inform me about his candidature on the SDP ticket. He came to see me as a friend. I have always treated him as a friend and a colleague. I was open and honest about his participation in politics and I had always treated him as a friend and a professional colleague. I had no malaise against him. He knows it. It was an academic contact, a friendly, informal discussion between me and him. He was seeking advice. Our discussion was cordial and I interacted with him as Head of the Department in the academic context. But later I discovered that he came with a political motive. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already disclosed in the press, I discovered that he was tape recording our conversation without my knowledge. If he was a gentleman, he should tell me, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \"I would like to record. We will talk openly.\" Put the tape recorder there. Let's talk. But he did not do it. What kind of gentleman is that? That is the question. It was not in a political context that we held our talk. It was in an academic context. I was there as the Head, as a friend. Many people know me - I speak, interact and give them the best. That was what I did. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have disclosed to the press that he tape recorded our conversation and I stand by it. When I asked him, he denied it and said that the tape-recorder was for his classes. He said in no uncertain terms, \"This is for my class, without doubt, for my class.\" I then took the tape-recorder from him and showed him that the cassette was still running. With the cassette running, who is so blind as not to see what it is? He still denied it. He swore blue and said, \"It is not. I am not recording you.\" I removed the tape. When I played the tape later, it showed that he had not only recorded that conversation but had also recorded a previous conversation of ours. There were third parties and other people involved. In the tape, there were two conversations. After I listened to it, I said to myself this is a chap whom I cannot trust, because he had not told me about the tape recording. This is not the end. I will tell you more. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can one do such an unreasonable act, if you ask yourself? A man who treats you openly, deals with you honestly, and you come and do such a thing! It is indeed a betrayal. It is, to my mind, morally and ethically wrong. He calls himself a neuropsychologist, a professional. Yet, he did not know it was not right to secretly tape a private conversation. You know, in the American Psychological Association, when you talk with your clients, you have to tell them, \"I am tape-recording you. You are on tape.\" You have to seek permission. He should know it. It is ethics of the American Psychological Association. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse, Sir, was that he persistently lied and he said that he was not recording when I showed him that the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> tape-recorder was running. He did not even apologise after being caught. I thought he would do it, but he never did. He behaved as if he had the right to do it. He displayed no human dignity or honour. He was not remorseful for his actions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in his press statement, he said that I snatched his tape and then alleged that I would terminate his service. A man like me would say such a thing? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Some hon. Members:</b> No. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> Terminate his service? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Play the tape and let's hear. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Vasoo:</b> We will come to that. I was very hurt and deeply disappointed, because after what I had done to help him, he had tried to trap me by secretly taping a private conversation with me, an academic colleague, who is Head of the Department, who had given him honest, friendly advice in response to his specific request. He asked me about politics. He said that he wanted to go into politics. I said, \"There are difficulties. There are challenges. There are issues.\" Obviously, when you are in politics, you are going to face problems and difficulties. It is quite natural. I was frank. I told him what it was. I felt what he had done was a serious breach of personal trust. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from that moment onwards, I had serious doubts as to his character and integrity. When a man can do this and not be open about it, when he is treated so nicely, when he is treated openly, when he is nurtured, we give him a chance, and he really downs you, you think any sensible person would not take heart to these things? After that event, I had my doubts on the character of Dr Chee. So I decided that this man's actions needed close monitoring and scrutiny. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Sir, in The Straits Times of 6th April 1993, Mr Chiam was reported to have called on me to return the tape to Dr Chee. He said, \"By taking it, it is theft, you know.\" He does not know what he is talking about. He said, \"It is his property and Dr Chee is entitled to it.\" I wish to \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> inform Mr Chiam and hon. Members that both the tape-recorder and the cassette are the property of the Department of Social Work and Psychology. They were purchased with University funds and allocated to Dr Chee for departmental use. Therefore, I did nothing wrong in retaining the tape after Dr Chee had surreptitiously tape recorded not one but two conversations with me and had also lied when he denied he was recording our conversation. I believe Mr Chiam owes me an apology. I saw the tape, I could recognise it. My Department has got vouchers to support the kind of tapes we buy and the tapes he used for recording. So we stand by what we have done and what I have said. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this taping incident was the turning point in my judgment of this young colleague. However, despite this incident, I kept my professional roles clear. If I had played politics, I would have played politics a long time ago. I know that within the academic world and within the academic context, my teaching comes first, my students come first, and I deal with them at my best. I did not play politics with Dr Chee. I did not expose him in the Marine Parade by-election rallies because I had this good stuff with me, this tape, to show what kind of a person he is. I did not even report to Associate Professor Ernest Chew, the Dean, and the University and even my party leaders, even PM Goh and all those people who were involved in the by-elections. I did not even breathe a word. It will be very useful material for them if I had passed it on to them. They could have used it. They could have asked me to go and talk at the Marine Parade by-election. I went there. I participated in the Marine Parade by-election. I spoke there at the rallies in Aljunied. I said let the people judge Dr Chee. I did not even say anything about him. I did not run him down. I had not done this. I have important evidence and information about his character, what kind of person he is, which should be useful for the party, but I refrained from giving them \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> to the Party. Does it not show that I have kept my roles very clear? The Party should have taken action against me for not divulging them. But it was a clear professional role that I played. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was only much later after I discovered that he had used funds and was dishonest in the investigations that I reported the taping incident to Professor Ernest Chew, the Dean, and kept the Vice-Chancellor informed. I did not tell them. I was an academic Head. My duty in such an incident was to report, but I said, \"Look, let us monitor this young man and see what is he like, what kind of person is he.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I subsequently reviewed my staff's work and their usage of research funds sometime in early January 1993, I paid special attention to Dr Chee's two research projects. They were in two different files. So you never know a picture unless you collate them and put them together. This was because of my doubts about his integrity in the light of his repeated denials of the taping incident. There must be something in this man that is not right. So I began to search, looking for things. Anybody would have done it. Because once you break the trust, and there is some character problem. Your doubts carry further. You look to assess whether this man does in a way stand tall. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered by collating information from the funds used from two research projects that he had sent parcels by courier service to Pennsylvania State University. I also discovered that he had made transport claims by taxi under his research vote amounting to $798. I shall say more about this later. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first deal with the parcels he sent by courier service. I found that he had on 8th September 1992 sent a parcel in his name using our University research fund amounting to $74.50. At first, it did not register in my mind that this was unusual as I thought that it was his research materials. Normally, all staff in the Department send all sorts of materials to all over the world. It is not easy to keep track of these things. However, I became suspicious \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> when I discovered that he had subsequently mailed two parcels at the same time on the same day, 9th November 1992. That is where I became more suspicious. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you why. In reviewing the invoices, my curiosity was further aroused, as one parcel, which was billed and paid under his wife's name, was sent to the Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University. Why did she send it? Why did he? He could not charge the cost of $53.50 to his research account because the parcel was sent in his wife's name, as the consignment note shows. But he did not tell the public that he sent his wife's parcel. He said he sent one parcel. Sir, may I ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute all the Annexes to Members and also to the press? [Copies of documents distributed to hon. Members]. They document all the things. We have nothing to hide. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Annexes A-1 to A-6 you will find the copies of consignment notes and invoices filed with the Department of Social Work and Psychology. These are all filed with my Department. They are carbon copies. Annexes A-7 to A-10 are copies of the original filed at the Bursar's Office. So I produce them because Mr Chiam says that I have doctored them here and doctored them there, that the receipts are not correct and there are some flaws in them. But they are all public documents which can be produced in Court. The Court can verify them. We have nothing to hide. They are all there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other parcel costing $151.50 was sent in his name and charged under his research vote. It was sent to the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State University. Who knows what he sends. Although he claims that I know his wife is there, but what materials did he send? Everybody's wife is studying here and there and how do I keep track. But he had no known research connections in the Pennsylvania State University. He mentions Dr Hynd's letter. It is from \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Georgia. From Pennsylvania, it has now gone to Georgia. We could establish all that. This is a letter dated 12th April. It is much later than what we have been querying for the past few months. I know he has written to George Hynd because George Hynd was his teacher in Georgia. They have worked together in research. He is a graduate of the University of Georgia. So he must have connections there. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parcel was sent in Skypak-sealed envelope and he forwarded it by courier service. He did not come and see me to say, \"Dr Vasoo, let me tell you what is in this parcel.\" No permission was sought from me. I was not informed of the actual contents. He was accountable for what he had sent. All staff mail all sorts of things out of the funds that have been allocated to them. As Head of the Department, we do not police, we do not follow, we do not go and dig out. That is an improper thing to do. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I had earlier authorised payments, I assumed these to be his research work because he had charged to his research vote. He is a professional, he should know best what he had sent. My office staff and I never open parcels mailed by staff. It would be highly improper to do this. You must trust your staff, they are academics who should have high personal integrity. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all the Annexes \"A\" show all the invoices and bills that are available. Mr Chiam says that I have covered up one part of it. I covered up one part of it to specifically indicate to Dr Chee what he had sent to make sure that he knows what it is. Knowing him, his arguments could turn out to be quite different. So you have got to show specific things. But there is nothing to hide. They are all there. They can be challenged. I am not afraid of showing all these documents. I can be challenged in the court to verify all these documents. They are authentic bills which have been filed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question is: why did he send two parcels on the same day to two different \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Departments at Pennsylvania State University? One to the Department of Psychology (which was sent in his wife's name) and another sent to the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (sent in his name). I suspected that the parcel sent to the Psychology Department must have been for his wife's external examiner. It had to be in his wife's name, otherwise, the external examiner would not know whose thesis it was. Under the American system, they appoint external examiners outside the Department in which you enrol as a PhD student. So at least I have got the picture. Otherwise, it will be difficult to discern. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then personally reported the matter to the Dean, Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew and kept the Vice-Chancellor informed. I gave them the invoices and consignment notes. They followed the case very closely. Coincidentally, on 15th January 1993 - this is where the bubble burst - Dr Chee's wife, Madam Huang Chih-Mei came to see me for a job in the Department. To clear my doubts and my suspicion, I asked her for details of the date of her PhD oral examination, names of her internal examiners, and her external examiner outside the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State University in which she was enroled as a PhD student. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She informed me that she defended her PhD oral examination at the end of November 1992 and gave me the names of her respective examiners. This information confirmed my suspicions. When you get these things together you get the real picture. The real picture emerged. As she had to appear for oral defence of her PhD examination before the end of November 1992, the parcels had to be sent quickly by courier service on 9th November 1992. She would be going to defend her PhD. Parcels had to be amnt early. So within two weeks the examiners would have read it and conduct the oral examination. Three of her examiners were from the Human Development and Family \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Studies Department. They knew her. The fourth was an external examiner from the Psychology Department at Pennsylvania State University who did not know her and would not have recognised the parcel if the sender had been Dr Chee and not herself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I subsequently made arrangements with the Dean, Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew to meet me and Dr Chee on 4th March 1993 to discuss Dr Chee's work and his use of research funds. I wanted the Dean to be present so that we can have an impartial person, who is also my superior, to meet with Dr Chee together with me. After the incident, when you do not trust the person anymore, and when you want to deal with such delicate matters, it is not easy. Otherwise, it would be between him and me. And if I do bring in my colleagues, senior colleagues, from the Department, he will say that I will be conniving with them to deal with the matter. So I thought the best thing was to have Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew to sit in, being an impartial witness, to deal with the situation. I no longer trusted him and I wanted a witness in Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew to deal with this situation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the meeting held on 4th March 1993 with Dr Chee, Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew and myself -- I read from the notes of the meeting, if you can refer to Annex B-1 and B-2 -- I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"He admitted that he had on both occasions sent his wife's dissertation. It was drawn to his attention that it was a misuse of the University's fund. He did not dispute that but explained that he thought Mrs Janice Chen was supposed to alert him and give him the bills to make payment. [Mrs Janice Chen is a staff in our office in charge of research accounts. She has worked in our Department for the last 15 years. She is a very careful person.] However when confronted that he could send his wife's dissertation by courier service on his own expenses as he had done so for one parcel which was charged to his wife's account, he could not give a satisfactory explanation. He was informed it was wrong to use the University research fund to send his wife's materials, he added that he had intended to make payment. His answer was not satisfactory.\" The notes of the meeting are there and Assoc. Prof. Chew, the Dean who arbitrates and deals in this matter, can vouch for it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not once during the meeting on 4th March did he claim that he was justified in using research funds in his research accounts for mailing his wife's dissertation. On the contrary, he indicated that he had already intended to pay. What does this mean? He was admitting that he personally had to pay for this and that it was wrong to charge it to the research vote. Otherwise, why was he expecting to be billed? However, when I later checked with Mrs Janice Chen, she stated in writing that Dr Chee had instructed her that the two courier payments in question (sent on 8th September and 9th November 1992) be charged to his research accounts. I refer you to Annex C for Mrs Janice Chen's statement. It is very clear, and she is very clear-minded, she is very specific, she is very meticulous. Normally, staff direct our research account staff to charge where it should be charged. It is not their business to go and decide to charge where they think best. Where research is concerned, the responsibility is on the researcher. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the meeting on 4th March 1993, Dr Chee was asked to give his explanation in writing. Because of my past experience in dealing with him and knowing him, I thought it was necessary to get him to put it in writing, so that we could then subsequently discuss and take up the matter further. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he had accused in the papers that that meeting was a political interrogation that we had. We are not running a Gestapo service. The Dean, a decent man that I know, honest Christian, and myself, together grilling him? Grilling him on a political arena? We were just there to talk to him about his work. We discussed about his academic orientation, his academic interest, because he had made statements in The Ridge -- you can read them, they are there -- and he felt that political involvement was more important than academic involvement. That was what he said, to that effect. Surely, in an academic institution, he has got to establish what the priorities are. The Dean \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> then discussed about this and, subsequently, also talked about issues related to the status of the University and why Dr Chee felt necessary to run the University down. During the discussions, the issue came up that Dr Chee thought that he was not as good, but he was taken in by the University, and he (Dr Chee) could not understand why. The Dean then sought for clarification that this view was not good image for the University. The Dean was just expressing an opinion. And he told him, \"Why didn't you clarify in the papers, if it was wrongly quoted?\" And all the time Dr Chee said that he was misquoted by the papers. So the Dean and myself said, \"If it is wrongly quoted, I think it is right that you write in to clarify the situation.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is what we asked. We talked about other related work. And then we went on to discuss about the use of his research funds. That was also a very important question that we need to establish an answer to our query. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the meeting, I immediately rang up Mrs Janice Chen to say, \"Watch out, he is coming. Be careful.\" Because I knew that he would be running there. Sure enough, he turned up in Mrs Chen's office after the call. He said to her that the invoices should be sent to him and not charged to the research vote. But she told him that they had already been charged to his research account, as instructed by him. Later, on the same day, I think in the late afternoon, probably at 4.30 pm, he went to see Janice Chen again. I see it is in the note. You can read Janice Chen's second note of 8th April 1993. I asked her to recollect this because I wanted to build up a case to show the kind of character that we are dealing with. I do not want to do this but I thought it was necessary. So this time he came at 4.30 pm to see Mrs Janice Chen to say that it was all right to have charged the invoices to the research account. He had shifted his position and wanted to find other new arguments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Chee gave a written explanation in a letter which was delivered to my \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> office on 9th March 1993. But it was dated 4th March 1993. I could not understand the difference of five days. But he backdated it, no doubt. Mr J J Isaac, the NUS Director of Personnel, received a carbon copy on 10th March. In his letter, Dr Chee shifted his position from the meeting of 4th March when he said that he had intended to pay the bills. Instead, he wrote that the two documents he had sent (he did not want to say it was a research PhD dissertation for examination) belonged to his wife's research which carried data on Singaporean children that was relevant to his research. He did not state that the documents were for purposes of his wife's PhD dissertation for examination. He argued that they were completed dissertation. Any completed dissertation can be done five years ago or maybe a few years ago. They were not completed dissertation. They were dissertation sent for examination. That is the main thing. He asserted that, to the best of his judgement, he felt that he was justified in using the funds in his research accounts for mailing the completed dissertation to the University involved so that the results could be quickly validated, and incorporated into his research. You can see, in Annex E, Mr Isaac received a carbon copy of Dr Chee's letter dated 4th March, with receiver's stamp of 10th March; Dr Vasoo's copy (Annex E1), with my note indicating that it was received on 9th March. They are there before you. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since his explanation in his letter dated 4th March was very different from what he had said, two days later, on 11th March 1993, we had another meeting. Dr Chee Soon Juan, Mr J J Isaac, Director of Personnel, the Dean, Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew, and myself were present. We went higher. There was a basis for him to present his case. Sir, the Dean, Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew, the Director of Personnel, Mr J J Isaac and Mrs Janice Chen are present in the officials' gallery to hear what I say, and they will be willing to vouch the facts. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this meeting on 11 March 1993, Dr Chee for the first time, I repeat, for the first time, confirmed that he had sent his wife's dissertation for PhD examination. He had suppressed the information earlier. He also confirmed the names of the examiners of his wife's PhD dissertation. In this meeting, he abandoned his first position that he had intended to pay and shifted to his written back-dated letter of 4th March that he was justified to send his wife's dissertation using University research fund as her dissertation contained materials relevant to his research. That is his argument now, a new line has developed. This was an untenable excuse. The simple point was that he had sent his wife's dissertation for examination using University funds, and that is the basic thing. We should not be detracted or sidetracked by this. His wife is not a full-time staff member, or our enroled PhD student. She worked part time, and did some research. She was associated six months, for a period of time, and that does not mean that she has got the right to use our University's fund to send the thesis for PhD examination. She is not a staff of the University. Neither is she an enroled PhD student in NUS. Sir, please see Annex F, notes of meeting held on 11th March 1993. It will give you an idea of what had transpired at this meeting. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to my mind, whether his wife's research was related or not to his research was irrelevant. The basic thing is that he had sent his wife's PhD thesis for examination which is already wrong in the first place. Nevertheless, on 13th March 1993, before the University served notice of termination on Dr Chee, I invited Dr John M. Elliott, Senior Lecturer of our Department, who is a respected local psychologist, to comment on the relevance of Dr Chee's University funded research project to his wife's research area. Dr John Elliott is a child developmentalist. He has also worked and researched in the neuropsychology area and he has, in fact, spent more than 15 years working and researching in this \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> direction. Dr John Elliot replied on 15th March (Annex G) and stated without qualification, and I quote, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I cannot see that it has any direct relevance.' And after explaining the different areas of work, he concluded, and I quote, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mrs Chee's research has no particular basis in neuropsychology. It is in a fundamentally different branch of psychology. Moreover, Ms Huang is dealing with children [they are toddlers two to three years old] younger than the range covered by Dr Chee's research, and she does not examine ethnic differences. Her work has no connection to Dr Chee's projects that I can see.' And Dr John Elliot is in the Public Gallery, Sir. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, similarly, I also requested Assoc. Prof. Ramadhar Singh to give his opinion. He is well known for his research work in social psychology. He has recently been awarded the Fellow of the American Psychological Association, which is a very prestigious award. He also concluded that he could not see a direct relation between the research reported in his wife's abstract and the research projects by Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in other words, two senior and experienced psychologists of our Department were of the view that Dr Chee's research and his wife's research were not related. And this debunks the argument that his research and his wife's research are all related and, therefore, he was justified to use the money. So that has been debunked. They are local people, they have done local research, they are very senior people, and they have given their opinions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the story does not end here. I have also brought to the University's attention that Dr Chee had, in January 1992, made transport claims for taxi trips, amounting to $798. In January, this year, I noticed that besides the three parcels sent by courier service to Pennsylvania State University, his taxi trips included 26 trips between NUS and First Toa Payoh Primary School at $12 per trip; and 24 trips between NUS and Braddell Primary School also at $12 per trip. The rounded sums of $12 for each of the 50 trips made me suspicious. Earlier \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> on, I thought it was a just claim. As you know, many Government servants do make claims and they do submit all sorts of claims, but one has got to read between the claims. Later, when all these issues came up, when you became suspicious, when you were unsure, you went back and have a look at them. This was what I did. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether Members know how much is the taxi fare for a trip from NUS to either First Toa Payoh Primary School or Braddell Primary School. I know some of you do not travel by taxi, but some of you do. Let me tell you what it is. As I had doubts, on 17th February 1993, to check on this, I travelled in a taxi of the Singapore Commuter Company, belonging to a taxi driver friend of mine, one Mr Hor Kin Mun, who is also a Radin Mas grassroots leader. He is a reliable person. I get him because you can get a print-out of the fare. I went from NUS to Toa Payoh in the early morning peak hours. I left NUS at 8.45 am. I made arrangements with him to pick me up. I took a taxi with him to Toa Payoh itself and then to Braddell Primary School which is just opposite. Toa Payoh Primary School is in Lorong 1 and Braddell Primary School is in Lorong 8. Mr Ong Teng Cheong can vouch for it. I can verify that it costs no more than $9. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also took a taxi trip on the same day from Toa Payoh to Nee Soon. I took the taxi from Singapore Commuter Company because it could still run with the pricing on. I did not go to Nee Soon Central but I went to Nee Soon itself to look for Nee Soon Community Centre. There are too many community centres in Nee Soon South and Nee Soon North and as such I could not get the bearing right. I really went there to check it out. But, unfortunately, because I could not establish which community centre it was, I decided not to give you the pricing of the fare. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, from my own experience, at non-peak hours, the fare will be less than $8.50. I used to live in Toa Payoh Central some 15 years ago. I know what the fare \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> is as I still take occasional taxi trips from NUS to Toa Payoh for occasional meetings at the Ministry of Community Development. When my car was sent for servicing, I would normally take a taxi. It would go via Toa Payoh Lorong 1 through Philips Singapore Pte Ltd and then to Singapore Labour Foundation (SLF). Toa Payoh Primary School is not too far away. That was how I began to assess what the fare was like. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, reported these excessive transport claims to the University and I left it to the University to take whatever action they consider necessary. I do not know why the University has not raised the abuse of transport claims with Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have presented the various facts, and I have documented the events that led to this unfortunate circumstance. Sir, I have recounted these facts in some detail so that hon. Members and the public will be left in no doubt as to the misconduct of Dr Chee. As Head of the Department, I had the duty to bring to the University's attention such misconduct of Dr Chee. If I had not done so, I would be covering up an activity which cannot be condoned. I would, in fact, be abetting him. If I had abetted him, action should be taken against me too. The basic question is Dr Chee's improper use of the University research fund. I have nothing personal against Dr Chee. I have treated him well. I have nurtured him and have brought him into the University. But did he behave like a gentleman from the way that I have described and discussed the case? It is up to Members to assess for themselves. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of my Department, both staff and students, who know me well, will tell you that I am not a vindictive type of person, or even a combative person. In fact, I had refrained from making any press statement until Dr Chee and the SDP sought to turn this into a political issue and attacked my motives. It is the SDP who has made this simple academic matter into a political issue and, today, they are side-tracking the whole thing into \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> an issue to arouse public sympathy for which it should not be the case. I must say that it is Dr Chee who has brought this problem upon himself. I have done what is right and necessary to maintain the academic integrity of an institution because we do deal with thousands of students, and I think this is crucial. To nurture and to provide the appropriate values to students, we must have academic staff who can stand tall, who have the integrity and the capacity to transfer, transmit and inculcate the right values to these young minds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no Head of Department can condone such misconduct by a staff member, like Dr Chee. [Applause]. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, having heard the detailed account from Dr Vasoo, I am wondering whether there is any need for me to say any more. But I do have to respond to Mr Chia's motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matter started as a disciplinary matter between an employer, the National University of Singapore (NUS), and its former employee, Dr Chee Soon Juan. But Dr Chee and his political party, the Singapore Democratic Party, have politicised the issue. They have questioned the integrity of the NUS and attributed his dismissal to political motives. Dr Chee has asked the SDP to put pressure on NUS to withdraw the charge of dishonesty against him, and the SDP has done so through various press comments. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister for Education, I cannot allow NUS' integrity to be impugned, or tolerate any political interference with the way NUS deals with staff matters. The NUS must be able to publicly defend any decision that it takes. Otherwise, its standing as an institution of higher learning will be diminished. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on the evidence, I am satisfied that NUS has acted correctly in dismissing Dr Chee for dishonest conduct. I am also satisfied that dismissal was the appropriate action, given the clear evidence of Dr Chee's dishonesty and the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> total gross misconduct which he had shown when he was found out for abusing his research grants. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NUS has released the letters concerning Dr Chee's termination and subsequent dismissal. Members have also heard from Dr Vasoo a detailed account of events and investigations leading to the termination. Let me briefly touch on the salient points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Vasoo, as Head of Department, discovered the suspicious items of expenditure during his annual review of staff research projects and their financial accounts in January 1993. When first confronted on 4th March 1993, Dr Chee's immediate and most telling reaction was not to dispute that it was misuse of his research funds but to claim that he had intended to make payment. In other words, he knew that he had to pay and that he had done wrong by charging the sums to his research account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same day, 4th March, immediately after meeting Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew and Dr Vasoo, Dr Chee went to see Mrs Janice Chen, the NUS staff in charge of research accounts. Dr Chee asked Mrs Chen about the invoices for the courier services. He said that the invoices should not be sent to the office but should be sent to him directly, as he knew that invoices received by the office might be settled from his research funds. Mrs Chen told Dr Chee that there should be no mistake in the accounts as it was done according to his instruction. We have all the statements to show it. Later the same day, Dr Chee told Mrs Chen that the charging of the invoices was correct and okay. In other words, it was only after Dr Chee found that he could not conceal his dishonesty that he shifted his position and decided to defend instead of covering up his misdeeds. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee subsequently submitted a letter of explanation dated 4th March 1993, the same day he met Dr Vasoo and Assoc. Prof. Ernest Chew. However, Dr Vasoo only received it on 9th March 1993, while Mr J.J. Isaac, the NUS Director of \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Personnel, received a carbon copy on 10th March 1993. In his letter, Dr Chee claimed that he felt entitled to use his research funds because his wife's thesis was related to his own research. This was a new claim which Dr Chee had not made at the meeting on 4th March. It contradicted his repeated statements at that meeting that he had intended to make payment. The letter also suppressed the material fact that the thesis had been despatched for the purpose of his wife's PhD examination. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when Dr Chee was confronted again on 11th March 1993 did he admit that the thesis was for his wife's examination. It was by four examiners in Pennsylvania State University, three within the wife's department and one external examiner in another department of the same university. He sent the three copies of his wife's thesis to her department under his own name and charged the cost of the courier service to his research fund. The fourth copy of the same thesis to be sent to the external examiner had to be despatched in the wife's name. Dr Vasoo has explained why. Hence, he could not charge this parcel to his research fund. Both parcels contained his wife's thesis, although Dr Chee subsequently claimed in his letter to the University dated 22nd March that the parcel in his wife's name contained material not relevant to his own research, and therefore he had to pay for this parcel himself. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a simple case of a lecturer who cheated the University by misusing funds intended for his own research. When caught, at first he admitted it, but then, instead of apologising and refunding the money, he tried to wriggle his way out by claiming that he was entitled to use his research funds because his wife's PhD thesis was relevant to his own research. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key issue is whether he was entitled to use his research money to send his wife's thesis for her PhD examination. Even supposing that his wife's thesis was relevant to his research, the answer is clearly \"no\". He is not entitled to use NUS \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> research funds for related research projects by anyone else, least of all his wife, unless there is a proper arrangement for research collaboration. Dr Chee's wife was not his research collaborator. Her dissertation was sent to the US for the purpose of her PhD examination. The examination was strictly his wife's personal matter. Clearly, it was wrong to use University funds to meet expenses incurred in such a personal matter. If Dr Chee is right, then he can also claim expenses incurred by his wife when she travelled to the US to defend her PhD thesis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, since Dr Chee claimed that his wife's PhD thesis is relevant to his research work, NUS sought expert opinion on this matter. Dr John M. Elliott, Senior Lecturer, and Assoc. Prof. Ramadhar Singh, both of the NUS Department of Social Work and Psychology, have confirmed in writing that the wife's thesis has no relevance to Dr Chee's research. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Dr Chee has not only misused NUS research funds but has also tried to mislead NUS in its investigations. Considering the nature and gravity of the offence, NUS decided to terminate Dr Chee's Agreement for Service, giving him three months' notice with effect from 18th March 1993. The NUS was, in fact, being lenient with him. It could have dismissed him on the spot. But I will give you examples of how it has dealt with cases like this. This is in accordance with his contract which stipulates that either party can terminate the contract with three months' notice in writing. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University's system of research funding hinges on the honesty and integrity of the persons doing the research and using the funds. Once a person has been caught misusing research funds, he has shown himself untrustworthy with funds and unfit to be a lecturer. The University must discipline him and uphold its integrity and reputation. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee's contract was terminated because of his total misconduct, not just because of his misuse of research funds. Had Dr Chee admitted that he had improperly used the $226 and appeared genuinely contrite, NUS might have viewed the episode differently. Had he admitted his mistake and offered to resign, the NUS might have accepted his resignation instead of terminating his services. But when he tried to cover up his misdeeds by successive untruths and prevarications, it became necessary for NUS to terminate his contract. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the grounds of Dr Chee's misuse of research funds and his conduct during the investigations, the NUS had already concluded that his dishonesty warranted termination of his contract. There was therefore no necessity to investigate Dr Vasoo's other complaint that Dr Chee had over-claimed for taxi fares. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his letter of appeal dated 22nd March 1993, Dr Chee wrote, \"Dr Vasoo had all the receipts with him when he approved the payments.\" He implied that Dr Vasoo knew the contents of the parcels when he approved payments. How could Dr Vasoo know what the parcels contained unless Dr Chee had told him? Dr Chee's statement is therefore calculated to mislead. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When invoices from companies are received by the Department, they are endorsed by the Head and transmitted to the Bursar's office for payment. The Head's role is only to ensure that the company submitting the invoice has already undertaken the work; in this instance, the sending of the two parcels. In the circumstances, Dr Vasoo, the Head, passed the invoice for payment in good faith. At no time did Dr Chee seek approval from the Head to send his wife's PhD dissertation for her examination. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after Dr Chee received the notice of termination and the rejection of his appeal, he has not pursued any of the proper remedies open to him. If he considered that the NUS had breached any of the terms of the Agreement for \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Service, he could have asked for arbitration as provided for under clause 17 of the Agreement for Service with the University. If he thought NUS' press statement or letters had defamed him, he could sue NUS for defamation, as he had publicly threatened to do. He has done neither. Instead, he has impugned the motives of NUS and sought to work up public feelings against the University. While on leave and receiving remuneration from the NUS, he launched a political attack on the University, declaring himself on hunger strike. He has asked a political party, the SDP, to put pressure on the NUS to withdraw its charge of dishonesty. Such actions by Dr Chee are calculated to bring NUS into disrepute and are wholly unbecoming of a staff member. The NUS cannot ignore such gross misbehaviour which aggravates his original misconduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that Dr Chee remained a staff member and continued to draw a salary from the NUS during the three months' notice period. In view of his gross misconduct, NUS dismissed him on 10th April 1993 with immediate effect, without notice or compensation, in accordance with clause 4(c)(iii) of his Agreement for Service with NUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NUS is fully justified both to terminate Dr Chee's contract for dishonest conduct and subsequently to dismiss him for gross misconduct. NUS must maintain high standards and cannot condone such flagrant misbehaviour from any staff member. The fact that Dr Chee is the Assistant Secretary-General of the SDP is irrelevant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the facts of the case have been revealed, we should ask the SDP whether it still condones Dr Chee's dishonesty and misconduct. The SDP said in its press statement of 1st April: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The SDP and its Secretary-General have full confidence in Dr Chee. Dr Chee has taken his decision (meaning the hunger strike) because, as a highly principled and deeply religious person, he passionately believes in the truth and in justice which has been denied him.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP and Dr Chee have turned a straightforward disciplinary matter \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> between NUS and Dr Chee into a political issue. Is the SDP so anxious to make political capital out of this case that it fails to differentiate between right and wrong? The SDP must make its position clear so that the public can judge the party for what it is. What is the SDP's view of Dr Chee now? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members have raised a few points which I would like now to explain. The first point raised by both Mr Chiam and Mr Chia Shi Teck is whether I can give examples of previous cases of termination. I can give them two examples. Fortunately, such cases are very rare in the University. So I have only two examples for them. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case 1. The most recent case. In 1992 an academic staff member who was provided with University quarters entered into a neighbouring University housing unit which was vacant to make IDD calls to the United States. When the University received bills from Telecom in respect of the IDD calls made from the vacant unit, it carried out an investigation and caught the academic staff member. The total cost of the IDD calls made from the vacant unit amounted to about $420. This academic staff member resigned within two weeks of being discovered and made full restitution for the amount of money incurred. That is the proper thing to do. He has a sense of shame in him. So he apologised, he paid up and he resigned. But not Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case 2. This is many years back. In 1978, that is 15 years ago, an academic staff member had made false claims from the University in respect of purchases made from Cold Storage Supermarket, Yaohan and certain other places. He had also made claims for the purchase of petrol purportedly to be used for a University boat used for collecting laboratory specimens from the sea. It was discovered that the purchases made from the Cold Storage Supermarket and Yaohan and other places were not purchases meant for his laboratory as he had claimed but in fact were food items for his home consumption. It was further discovered \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> that the petrol he had purchased was not used for the University boat but for his car. By the time he was found out, the false claims that he had made and received from the University amounted to about $11,000. On 12th December 1978, the University terminated his appointment with one month's notice. The University has been quite kind. He also made full restitution of the amount that he had falsely claimed. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we can see from these two instances that the termination of Dr Chee's appointment is nothing unusual. In fact, the University was being kind to him. Now this whole argument has been turned around and Chiam said, \"Look, because he has been given notice of termination with compensation, with leniency, therefore the reason must be to avoid charging him in court.\" That is utter rubbish. If you read the letter of termination, four times he was called \"dishonest\". If he is an honourable man and an academic, he should go to court and sue for defamation. What is all this excuse that he cannot sue because he has no case. It is utter rubbish. What about the other case? He has now been sacked without notice. Now, he can sue. There is no notice. He is sacked. Sue. He does not dare do it. He says it is going to cost a lot of money, but he has got good advisors - two lawyers on his side. They should give him proper advice. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Firstly, on this question of the tape, I have to determine really whose property it is. If it is the property of the University, then I certainly owe an apology to Dr Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here to look at the facts and not to be too emotional about the whole matter. There is so much talk about Dr Chee's dishonesty and wrongful use of University funds. But there are no facts, up to this point of time, to show that in fact he was dishonest. What are the rules and regulations in the University governing the use of research fund which he has breached? You point out to me. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> There are no clear-cut procedures and no detailed rules and regulations in regard to use of the funds. The Minister has said that even if you are a research collaborator who helps him in his research work, and he spends money on it, he is wrong. But where is this rule? Or is it just out of his own mind? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two disciplinary cases could be easily distinguished. One is definitely way out. He made purchases from Cold Storage and Yaohan, you should sack him on the spot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the other case, he took an intentional step. The intention was in fact theft. He purposely went next door to make a call. There was an intentional step taken. It should be distinguished from Dr Chee's case. In his mind, the two works had some connection. This reminds me of the Colosseum in Rome - kill, kill, kill! I would be very grateful if the Minister could point out exactly which regulation he has breached. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument can turn both ways. If you say that Dr Chee is dishonest, then it should be under clause 4(c)(iii) straightaway. But you dare not go under clause 4(c)(iii). You go under clause 4(a), and now you say, \"We give him a chance.\" Is that being kind? But it does not match all your allegations of dishonesty. We look at the facts. The fact is that you went under clause 4(a) and we take what you mean. It is in writing. Now you try to explain away a point of fact which you have taken. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards this University staff, Mrs Janice Chen, according to what Dr Chee has said, in fact, he gave his wife's dissertation without any cover. It was just plain like that [indicating] and handed to Mrs Janice Chen. I do not know whether she is in the House. If she is, she could confirm whether or not it was just handed to her unpacked, like that [indicating]. So all the headings could be seen that it is the work of Dr Huang Chih-Mei. Dr Vasoo tried to point out that he did not see it, it was under cover, it was improper for him to check. Now we want to know whether or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not Dr Chee had tried to conceal it. But from what I have been told, he handed the whole parcel just like that [indicating] to Mrs Janice Chen. Let us hear from her whether or not he tried in any way to conceal it. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I sympathise with Mr Chiam. He is in a very difficult position. He is a good lawyer and he tries to make a good case. He sets out all the facts. Alas, he has got to defend himself. I will be very generous to him. Maybe he had not known the full facts beforehand and so he had been misled. He had opened his mouth too soon in public. He saw that there was a case for him to attack the PAP. So he went for it. Now he is in a fix. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Point No. 1, no clear regulations. I can show him that it is clearly stated in the University (I can hand this copy to the press afterwards) the amounts you can spend, equipment, $2,000; consumables, so much. Are you saying that these rules must contain items that you cannot spend this on your wife's dinner; you cannot spend this on your wife's thesis? This is a professional man who is entrusted with big sums of money to spend on research. You must have the integrity to decide whether it is relevant or not relevant. This is point No. 1 \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point was that the parcel was open, so everybody could see. What does that mean? Is Mrs Chen supposed to recognise, \"Oh, this is your wife's thesis, you cannot do it.\" How can she know? Dr Vasoo may be approving hundreds of cases every month. It has got to be personal integrity. There is no other way. His point about termination, therefore, is wrong. You have the facts, $420. That fellow was ashamed of it. He knew he did wrong, he confessed. Dr Chee does not have the shame in him. You look at the notes of the first meeting. He admitted he had to pay. His immediate reaction was most telling. He went to see Mrs Chen. He found he could not cover up. Then he changed track. Now he dragged in his Professor from Georgia University to try \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> and justify his reasons. I think Mr Chiam should take a deep breath, look at the full facts and decide carefully before saying anything else. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, after listening to Dr Vasoo and the Minister, Mr Lee Yock Suan, I am much clearer as to the motive of this young man. I am more convinced that his hunger strike is a publicity-seeking, politically-motivated move. This hunger strike is a psychological ploy to play on the emotions of Singaporeans. In doing this, he wants to draw people's attention away from the wrongs he did in the University. Sir, there are hidden agendas in this hunger strike, among which his wrong-doings in the University and a wider political motive he has in mind. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been studying Dr Chee's behaviour during the by-elections. I see him as a young politician in a hurry. He knew how to win the crowd. He knew how to do this. He must win over their emotions. The topics he selected to speak on must therefore be simple bread-and-butter issues, especially on the needs of the poor and how Government policies have made them poorer while at the same time the Government gets richer and those who support it or are associated with the PAP will also be richer. He saw the big crowd at his rally as a measure of his success. They warmed towards him because he is a fresh face in politics, with a university degree and dare to talk and criticise the PAP. I can imagine he felt great and thus develop a sense of self-importance because the SDP was praising him, even over-shadowing Mr Chiam. The media was quoting him and the rally crowds were cheering him. I sense that because he was so captured by the tremendous response, the sudden thrust to achieving greatness, he lost his sense of judgment and reality. He became a victim of his own psychological training. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he started to tread on the fringe of megalomaniac behaviour, he felt important and delusions of greatness, boosted by his so-called popularity \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> response, made him to challenge authority, his immediate superior, his University, his own Party, his family's attempt to stop him, on embarking on his hunger strike, and even has the audacity to urge the SDP to pressure the University. He had his delusions dented after the by-election results when the Prime Minister won by more than 70% of the votes. I am sure he must be wondering how the big rally crowds turned away and rejected his politics of envy. Therefore, this attempt at hunger strike had also a hidden political motive to try and recapture lost political ground and self-importance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Vasoo -- you look at Dr Vasoo -- is he a vindictive man? Can he be vindictive? Listen to his parliamentary speeches. They are always fairly standard. I am sorry. But they are fairly standard. He is always asking for the Government to do more for the poor, for the old, for the disabled. And when he heard I wanted to start a non-profit community hospital, he was the first to volunteer to help me. He is, by all accounts, a reasonable man. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Vasoo was in a no-win situation. Under the difficult circumstances, he had to make a decision. He must do the right thing. Here was one of his staff who had committed an offence, but this staff member happened to be an Opposition member. To remove him is to court problems, because he will be accused of being politically motivated in sacking him. Yet, not to do so is to perpetuate a wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Chee, he wants people to believe that he is being vindicated for political reasons. But Dr Vasoo did the right thing. He sent all his findings of Dr Chee's dishonest behaviour to the University, and the University decided that Dr Chee acted dishonestly. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, many outside this House argue that Dr Chee should be allowed to continue his work till his contract expires. But is this the right thing \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> -- to allow him to perpetuate his wrongdoings in the University? Sir, this matter is strictly between the University and Dr Chee. The University, by way of the Minister for Education, has come out in the open to explain why Dr Chee's service has to be terminated. If Dr Vasoo was not the head, the whole affair probably will not have been so hot. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if every time a member of the University staff, under a PAP head, is dismissed and is deemed to be politically motivated, then these heads of department cannot function effectively and fairly because of this political blackmail. And worse still, if such dismissed member has to be reinstated because he threatens suicide by jumping from a tall building or threatens to start starving to death, then how is the University, or for that matter any organisation, going to function? We cannot allow emotions to rule in such circumstances. We cannot give in. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, even Mr Chiam has been put in a tight spot by Dr Chee's hunger strike. He did not want to debate this in Parliament. There was plenty of time for him to file an adjournment motion. But, I guess, Dr Chee's case was not strong enough for him to make this adjournment motion, but he left it to the Nominated MP, Mr Chia Shi Teck, to bring it up. Therefore, his argument to condemn the Government that Dr Chee's dismissal by the University was politically motivated is weak and cannot be supported. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, Mr Speaker, Sir, I want to move an amendment to Mr Chia Shi Teck's motion. Sir, I beg to move, \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, to add -- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and deplores the SDP's action in politicising an internal NUS disciplinary matter, and pressuring NUS to rescind its action against a dishonest staff member'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amended motion will therefore read like this: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House expresses its concern over the allegation by Dr Chee Soon Juan that his dismissal from NUS for alleged misuse of his research funds amounting to a sum of $226.00 was politically motivated, and seeks clarification from the Minister for Education of the actual facts that caused Dr Chee's \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> dismissal and deplores the SDP's action in politicising an internal NUS disciplinary matter, and pressuring NUS to rescind its action against a dishonest staff member.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would hate to see a young Dr Chee going into coma and losing some of his good brains. If not for anybody's sake, I would urge him to listen to his mother, whom I read in the papers, is also not in good health. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, may I ask Mr Chiam to show me the letter dated 8th April sent by Dr Chee to Professor George Hynd. I think it is very, very important, because I want to find out the contents of that letter, and I can see there could be relevance to this reply from research Professor George Hynd, University of Georgia. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> It has been proposed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, as an amendment, at the end, to add - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and deplores the SDP's action in politicising an internal NUS disciplinary matter, and pressuring NUS to rescind its action against a dishonest staff member'. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, \"That the words proposed to be added, be there added.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is a bit unfortunate that the hon. Member did not hand in this amendment earlier to the Members of the Opposition. But from what I have heard of the speech of Dr Tan Cheng Bock, he has not brought up any evidence at all to show that the SDP, in fact, took steps to pressure the NUS or to politicise the whole matter. I think SDP gave a statement the day after Dr Chee went into a hunger strike. We categorically asked him to call off the hunger strike and to stop it straightaway. How can that be an action of pressuring NUS? Our action is that we support his claim that he was not dishonest. But we deplore this action of hunger strike. We feel that nobody should endanger his health or his life or, in fact, affect the welfare of any members of the family with anything that can affect his health or his life. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, where is the evidence that the SDP is trying to make political capital out of this and to pressure the NUS? I think \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> this amendment should be summarily dismissed by this House for lack of evidence. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of clarification. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam asks: where is the evidence that the SDP is bringing pressure upon the University? In fact, my recollection is that the SDP issued a statement, apart from whatever they might have said about the hunger strike, that the NUS' actions were vindictive, it was vindictive action on the PAP Government, and asked the NUS to reinstate Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him now: does the SDP no longer insist on that position or does it still stand by that statement? Because if he stands by that statement, that is the evidence of bringing pressure on the University. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, we believe Dr Chee is innocent. And in the circumstances, unless he is proven guilty-- \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> We have done that. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> But where is the evidence? I mean, it is quite clear the University dismissed him under clause 4(a), unless this House refuses to accept that fact. But it is in writing. So his dismissal is not based on dishonesty. Let us get it very clear. It was a contractual term, either party could give three months' notice. The University has every right to ask Dr Chee, \"Can you please leave? We give you three months' notice.\" Similarly, Dr Chee also has the right to walk out and say, \"I am serving my three months' notice and I leave the University.\" Nobody can stop either party from exercising his contractual right. So up to now there is no evidence, even with the second sacking. If you read carefully what the University says, it is that he is sacked summarily for improper conduct, and the improper conduct is based on the fact that he went on a hunger strike and instigated politically against the University. He asked the SDP to pressure the NUS. So where is the evidence? There is no evidence at all. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> My question of Mr Chiam was whether after having heard everything, Dr Vasoo's detailed explanation and the detailed statement of the Minister for Education, Mr Chiam still insists that the NUS reinstate Dr Chee, as was insisted upon by the SDP in its statement. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> The SDP now withdraws that statement because Dr Chee himself later has mentioned that he does not wish to be reinstated.

It is written quite clearly here, and I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Singapore Democratic Party last night came out in full support of sacked University lecturer, Chee Soo Juan, to back his claim that his dismissal was politically motivated. And the statement was signed by party chief, Chiam See Tong.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Can I just clarify one point? Mr Chiam keeps claiming that this termination was just an ordinary contractual thing. Both parties are not happy, so there is the right to terminate. Let me just read a paragraph from this letter of termination dated 18th March 1993, which was released to the press and published in full: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because of your dishonest conduct, the University in accordance with ... hereby gives you three months' notice ....' \"Because of your dishonest conduct\" - this is what it says. Is there no cause? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> It is very difficult to convince the Minister. You can say what you like but the fact is that the dismissal was based on clause 4(a). It is in black and white. I did not make this statement. It is the University which used clause 4(a) and they are bound by it and clause 4(a) is very clear. There is no allegation of dishonesty but it is a straight-out contractual exercise of the University's right. And please do not tell me that the University is kind. The University is an academic institution. They say what they mean. Surely, they will know how to read. [Interruption]. But then you should go under clause 4(c)(iii). \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think he can just go back and read the letter of termination. It is full of grounds for termination. He said that \"dishonesty\" was mentioned three times and \"admitted\" was mentioned four times. So all the causes are there. It is just that the University wants to follow its past practice of dealing with such cases, like the case of the staff member who went into a neighbouring house and made the phone calls. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> So he was allowed to resign. Even the staff who was dishonest with $11,000 was given termination notice. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>An hon. Member:</b> Same clause? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Same clause. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mr Speaker, if the Minister is right, everybody who enters into a contract, or anybody who puts it in writing can explain it away, \"Oh, I did not mean that. I mean something else.\" Then it will make a mockery of all that is written in black and white. So the University is bound by what it has written. That is very clear and simple. I do not think I want to go into this point again. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mr Chia Shi Teck has described this incident as the saga of Dr Chee Soon Juan. I think that it would be better described as a betrayal of Dr S. Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this whole affair started because Dr Chee alleged that his dismissal was politically motivated, that is, by the PAP. It would seem that political manipulation of this whole affair by the SDP is a more correct assessment. In alleging that the dismissal was politically motivated, Mr Chiam gave these reasons. Firstly, because Dr Vasoo, the Head of Department, happened to be a PAP MP. Now that Dr Vasoo has given his whole explanation, I am sure that this House is convinced, if Mr Chiam is not, of the wrongdoings and misconduct of Dr Chee. Mr Chiam has also made a big song and dance about all the letters that Dr Chee had written to the press and how these had affected the case. He also mentioned about the involvement of Mr Matthias Yao and Dr Ong Chit Chung. Sir, let me say that all these have no bearing on the case. Many people write to the press but the Party has never been accused of being politically motivated against this person. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the letter from the University of Georgia has also given proof to show that this whole affair is politically motivated. However, we should note that the letter was dated 12th April, that is, after the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> hunger strike was announced and the letter that was written to Prof. George Hynd was dated 8th April. And, as mentioned by Dr Vasoo, Prof. George Hynd was a lecturer of Dr Chee Soon Juan and he was a person known to him before. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the disclosures made by the Minister for Education and Dr S. Vasoo, as Head of Dr Chee's Department, speak for themselves. Let us quickly recapitulate the sequence of events and some salient points which show that the SDP has politically manipulated this whole betrayal. The charade actually started before the Marine Parade GRC by-election, that is, in September 1992. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Dr Chee received the news of his termination from NUS, he alleged that the action was politically motivated and he subsequently also informed his party colleagues, that is, he expected his party to respond. What other evidence do we need to show that this is politically motivated? We feel that the SDP is out to make political capital of this. Before all this happened, Dr Chee was very involved in the exchange of letters in the Straits Times and was a rising star in the SDP and heir apparent to Mr Chiam. He was, if you compare it with the PAP hierarchy, equivalent to a Deputy Prime Minister. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subsequently, he decided to seek redress and to go on a hunger strike from 6.00 am on 5th April 1993. Hunger strikes are no small matters and they are not matters to be taken lightly. As my colleague, Mr Peh, has said earlier in Mandarin, before the hunger strike which was announced to start at 6.00 am, he had a grand feast at 5.30 am, a feast prepared by his wife. If I may take a translation from the Lianhe Zaobao, as I do not read the Chinese papers, this is what it says. It is an article written by Mr Lim Kim Huat. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His wife, Dr Huang Chih-Mei, personally prepared a breakfast which comprise vegetables, beans, mushrooms, chicken and rice for Dr Chee before his hunger strike. At 6.00 am yesterday, Dr Chee sitting on a sofa in the living room, read the Lianhe Zaobao and the Straits Times and began his hunger strike.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, hunger strikes are never to be taken lightly. Why? Because the ultimate would \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> be damage to his health and, of course, when taken to the infinite end, it would mean death. When he was asked why he went on a hunger strike, he said that this was the peaceful way to show his protest. Peaceful, for who? For himself. It definitely caused discomfort to his family, to his mother, to his relatives, to his brothers and siblings. It does not give us a good picture of a man committed to a cause, a man who was so affected and so conscientious about what he believed in that he decided to go for a hunger strike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he also said that he did not want to cause unnecessary alarm. But look, what have all these done? Day after day, we have newspaper reports about what is happening to him. And one writer to the Straits Times had this to say. He was quite amused in the beginning when he read about the hunger strike. But when he sat down in a coffeeshop, and he heard students talking about it that they can also use this as a tactic, he was worried. He asked the newspapers to stop carrying stories about this. And this morning we heard Mr Chiam challenging Mr Peh to a hunger strike. How much further is this going to carry on? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the course of all this, how did the SDP react? They issued a very cunning statement. On one hand, they would seem to be so fair and reasonable. They said that the hunger strike was his own personal decision. It is a very fair statement. It showed concern. It called on Dr Chee to stop his hunger strike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> rose --- \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Dr Beng, are you giving way? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> No, Sir. They provided a doctor to check on Dr Chee daily and they paid for his bills. He was a doctor who neither belonged to the SDP nor the Workers' Party. But they also said in the press statement: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Contrary to media reports, the SDP and its Secretary-General have full confidence in Dr Chee and have always supported Dr Chee in the sincerity of his actions.' \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Next quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The SDP sympathises and respects the deep conviction and belief of Dr Chee in his present course of action.' What is this present course of action? The hunger strike. What does all this tantamount to? Condoning, encouraging, manipulating or abetting? I do not know. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SDP has politicised the whole issue and has tried, unfortunately, for them but, fortunately, for Singapore, to make Singaporeans believe that the hunger strike is the right way and the only way to redress this issue. I quote: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The SDP believes that Singaporeans are now enlightened and will take note of what Dr Chee is doing for the long-term good of Singapore. We were asked to believe that hunger strikes are the way to redress whatever we feel is wrong and that is being done wrong to us. This is for the long-term good of Singapore.' \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Chee goes even further. As first Assistant Secretary-General, SDP, as I have said, it is equivalent to a Deputy Prime Minister, to galvanise support for himself and when talking of political realities in Singapore, he asked \"whether Singaporeans want to live with this aspect of Singapore's political life?\" Here, he was talking about being victimised, etc, and if not, to take concrete action, like himself, to change it. What is this concrete action that he is talking about? Hunger strike. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 8th April, in reaction to the SDP's statement, Dr Chee urged the SDP to put pressure on the NUS. Is this the political system we want to adopt? Next time, what will happen? If a Member, or anyone of us, or a Member of the Opposition is not promoted in a department whose Head may, unfortunately, again happen to be Dr Vasoo, he will be accused of being politically motivated. If someone cannot find employment in the University, it is political motivation. If someone cannot find admission to a junior college, it is political motivation. Where will all these lead us? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when asked if Dr Chee would heed the party's advice, he said, \"I will be the laughing stock, if I stop now.\" Pride, we \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> see here, comes in the way and not penitence. I would urge him, for his own sake, and if not for his own sake, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock said, for the sake of his ill mother, to stop this and not let pride get in the way. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reaction of the PAP shows that this whole affair is politically motivated. Firstly, let us note that no PAP MP, besides Dr Vasoo in his capacity as Head of Department, commented on this whole affair. Mr Chiam, unfortunately, was beaten by Mr Chia Shi Teck in bringing up this motion to the House. This motion was not proposed by any PAP MP. It was the Prime Minister who directed us to support this motion and we did out of respect for him and due to his very persuasive techniques. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of us here did not believe that it was correct to discuss this whole issue here. Why? Because we believe that Dr Chee, who is not in this House and not an MP, when we discuss this whole affair, he will not be here to defend himself. We did not feel that it was fair to him. But in the light of the fact that the NMP has moved this motion, we felt that we had no choice but to participate. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me close by referring to my good Friend, Dr Vasoo. You have listened to him. What were the words he used? \"Betrayal\", \"hurt\", \"disappointment\". This is not a man who is vindictive. This is not a man who goes around fixing people. He tried to help this young man. He stuck his head out and almost got it chopped. He even pleaded for Dr Chee, so much so he got the 14th month bonus. Yet, when this young man came to see him for advice as to whether he should go into politics, he carried with him a tape-recorder which did not belong to him, with a tape which did not belong to him, and recorded the conversation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reminds me of my own initial days before I decided to become an MP. My wife and I visited Dr Tan Cheng Bock and his wife to have a talk with him on the pros and cons and the problems of being an MP. I did not carry a tape-recorder, I \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> assure you, Dr Tan. But it really brought back memories. You are seeking out a friend, someone you can trust, someone who would tell you the problems of being an MP. And yet you carry along with you a tape-recorder. I think this is almost unforgivable. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are there any more Members who would like to speak on the amendment? Yes, Mr Koo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Koo Tsai Kee (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in politicising the affair, I think Mr Chiam See Tong has also defamed my friend and colleague, Dr Vasoo, when Mr Chiam made a statement to the press saying that Dr Vasoo should return the tape. Mr Chiam said, \"That is stealing, you know.\" He is implying that Dr Vasoo is a thief. As far as I know, the only thing Dr Vasoo has stolen is his time that he could spend with his family and in serving the nation. I want to ask Mr Chiam whether he will personally apologise to Dr Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support Dr Tan's amendment to Mr Chia's motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listening to Mr Chiam, there is a fallacy in his logic. He says Dr Chee's employment was terminated under clause 4(a) and he says that that is a contractual termination. Since there is a contractual termination, therefore, there cannot be any allegation of dishonesty. That is Mr Chiam's reasoning. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mr Chiam has to distinguish is between the act of termination and the reasons for the termination. The act of termination could either be contractual or by summary dismissal. The reasons for the termination have been repeated several times in writing. And the reasons are, as we heard from the Minister for Education, the dishonesty. So Mr Chiam can say what he likes about the mode of termination. He could say that Dr Chee should have been summarily dismissed instead of being given a contractual termination. What he cannot dispute is that the University has always said that the reason \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> why it is terminating Dr Chee's contract was for reasons of dishonesty. It is a logical fallacy when you try and combine the two. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard Dr Vasoo stating the facts. Prior to that, I was a bit more moderate in my view of Dr Chee's conduct and the way the SDP has handled it. After listening to it, it seems very difficult to justify any aspect of either SDP's conduct or Dr Chee's conduct. The following appears to be clear: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Dr Chee was given a research grant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) He used part of the research grant to courier his wife's thesis. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) At the time he did so, he had not sought the University's permission to use the funds for that purpose. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The University found out about that and asked him for an explanation. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Dr Chee admitted to the usage of the funds but sought to justify his action on grounds that his wife's thesis was relevant for his own research and that therefore he was entitled to have it validated. We now learn from Dr Vasoo that, in fact, he has prevaricated and changed his position on this a number of times. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The University characterised his conduct as dishonest and terminated his employment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Dr Chee accuses the University of fixing him for his political beliefs and goes on a hunger strike, and now Dr Chee gets sacked. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the facts. Let us consider the crucial ones. First, Dr Chee's usage of the research funds to courier his wife's thesis. There has been an extended discussion on whether his wife's thesis was or was not relevant to his work. I think that sort of analysis misses the wood for the trees. Let us look at it sensibly. We are all men of the world. If you think about it without emotion, without taking sides, objectively, \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> you cannot but agree that it was a very silly thing to do, perhaps even a stupid thing to do. Dr Chee was obviously taking some advantage with the funds that had been allotted to him. It was an incorrect thing to do and I would say patently so. It is in a way like coming into the restricted zone without a disc or leaving your car parked without a parking coupon. These are irresponsible indiscretions which get committed. You commit them, you get pulled up. What should you do? You admit and try and close the matter or do you try and talk your way out? I think it would be best to admit rather than compound the problem. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say that you accept the argument that he was entitled to pay the courier charges because his wife's thesis was relevant. Where do you draw the line if you accept the argument? What about paying a secretary to type the thesis? Or paying for photocopying of the thesis? Or paying an allowance to his wife for completing the thesis? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has put forward a letter from the University of Georgia dated 12th April, after this affair broke. The letter does not help the case that Mr Chiam makes. Let us give this well, and I would say, carefully drafted letter from Dr Chee's alma mater full weight. Still, how does Mr Chiam justify the paying for the courier charges for sending the parcel by Dr Chee not to his university but to his wife's? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it this way. Dr Chee's funds could arguably, at best, be used to send the thesis for his own research purposes to his own supervisors, not for any other purpose. And without putting too fine a point on it, it was an indiscretion. I think most of us, including probably even Mr Chiam, can agree on that. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Dr Chee's case, having committed that indiscretion, he was asked to explain himself. He could, and in my view, should have simply come clean at that stage. He may have feared the consequences, but there was simply no choice. It would have been better to admit and minimise the damage rather than try and bluster your \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> way out of a messy situation. That is so even if Dr Chee felt that his indiscretion attracted too close an attention because of his political background. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us leave aside for a moment Dr Chee's political background. Let us ask ourselves: if what he had done had come to light, how would we expect the University to react? We would expect the University to ask him for an explanation. If he comes clean, then we will expect the University to act proportionate to the nature of the incident. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put it in another way. Assume that it was a PAP MP who did it. Would not Mr Chiam go to town with the news? And could Mr Chiam expect the University to ignore the act? However, the problem in this case was that when confronted with his indiscretion, Dr Chee, quite unfortunately, sought to explain it away. That was very unwise. His explanation quite simply does not stand scrutiny. That is clear if you are to look at it without any bias for, or against, him. Whether you are for or against Dr Chee, at that stage, his conduct becomes unsupportable. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that Mr Chiam does his case any good by attempting to draw a distinction between Dr Chee's case and the case of a lecturer who goes over to a neighbouring unit to make a telephone call. That is a distinction without a difference. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University has chosen to characterise the totality of the conduct as being dishonest. Giving Dr Chee the maximum benefit of doubt and leaving aside his political background, I think anyone would say that his conduct certainly leaves something to be desired. It was neither right nor proper. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate on this motion, including Dr Tan's amendment, has to be seen in that context. The question really is: (1) Can Dr Chee's conduct be justified? (2) Should the SDP, which puts itself forward as a responsible Opposition party, support his conduct? For the reasons I have already given, I think it is difficult to support or \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> justify Dr Chee's conduct when he refused to admit his error. Secondly, should the SDP support Dr Chee? That depends simply on the question of whether the SDP can objectively justify Dr Chee's actions. Mr Chiam and his colleagues should consider the facts carefully, and reply in detail to the factual allegations that have been made. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what do we have? The SDP and Mr Chiam have not until today said why they think Dr Chee is free of blame. Quite simply, on the facts until today, until Mr Chiam spoke earlier, SDP has kept silent. I have seen the press statements that have been issued by the SDP. They are noteworthy only for the fact that they are silent when it comes to Dr Chee's conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Mr Chiam gave a defence of Dr Chee's actions. What are the defences? First, he said that Dr Chee's wife's thesis was relevant to Dr Chee's work. That, with the greatest of respect to Mr Chiam, does not answer the question. It is simply avoiding the issue. Quite simply, Dr Chee was not entitled to use his research funds to pay for his wife's courier charges. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Mr Chiam said the rules and regulations on usage of research funds do not spell out how the research funds are to be used. To support that proposition, he read out a rule which deals with how bills and invoices were to be submitted. That, again with respect to Mr Chiam, must have been tongue in cheek. Mr Chiam, a trained lawyer, must know that that is simply an administrative provision. Mr Chiam's argument is that the rule requires Dr Chee to send in his invoices for all expenses incurred by him. Dr Chee did so. Therefore, in Mr Chiam's view, Dr Chee did everything properly. Surely that is absurd. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking Mr Chiam's example, can you go out to dinner and charge it to your research account? It takes neither a lawyer nor a PhD to realise that one's research funds can only be used for purposes of one's own research. Financing any aspect of your wife's thesis falls outside the rule. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP will have to deal clearly with that and state with conviction their stand. When they state their stand, they must deal with what Dr Vasoo has stated. The unfortunate part of this exercise is that I consider one of the most honourable and distinguished Members of this House, who has spoken on behalf of very poor people most of the time, has been defamed grossly. The SDP should face this issue with moral courage without avoidance of the issues. Instead of doing that, the SDP has simply used Dr Chee as a political football. It does not bode well for the SDP's role as a responsible Opposition. Before espousing Dr Chee's cause, Mr Chiam and the SDP should satisfy themselves that despite all that Dr Vasoo has said, Dr Chee is free of blame and has indeed been victimised. If they are so satisfied of that and can give convincing reasons for their stand, then I would be the first to say that the SDP has a duty to raise the issue, both in this House, and outside, with all its vigour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to Dr Chee and the hunger strike, it is a childish thing to do. If he feels that he is not wrong, he should explain himself. If he feels that the termination of his employment is politically motivated, then he has to fight his battle politically. In the next election, he can and should take the issue to the voters. A hunger strike is acceptable only when you have no other means of fighting a political fight. Where you have proper means, like contesting elections, with a possibility of winning, as Mr Chiam will testify, then you should work within the system. Not to do so will lead people to question the motive for your actions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if he feels that the University is wrong in calling him dishonest, then he should consider suing. The University has made various statements which are clearly defamatory. I would assume that the University has obtained legal advice before making those statements. It is perfectly clear that the University is prepared to stand by its statements, if \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> sued. Dr Chee appears to have given cost of a legal suit as one reason for not suing. Mr Chiam has had some experience on the law of defamation. He has successfully obtained damages for defamation in the past. His experience should satisfy cynics that the system can be worked. Given that, I cannot see why, if his case has any merit, Dr Chee should not be advised by Mr Chiam to sue. One asks: Do Mr Chiam and the SDP stand by Dr Chee? If they do, then why should cost be a factor? If the SDP does not ask Dr Chee to go to the court to sue the University for defamation, then one has to seriously question the SDP's own motive. One can only conclude that the SDP prefers to make political capital of the issue rather than have Dr Chee's conduct tested in court. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little purpose in turning this debate into a session for trading emotion-charged accusations which only have accidental relevance to the facts. If they are convinced of Dr Chee's innocence, the best way to test that innocence is to have a Judge decide it. Mr Chiam has spent time explaining why the University could not be sued for breach of contract. He said that there was no cause of action. Mr Chiam knows or should know that, in addition to contract, there is a cause of action in defamation. If someone says that Mr Chiam is dishonest, he will sue. Will he not? It is the same for Dr Chee. Even if he does not want to sue, there is really no need for Dr Chee to paint himself into a corner. He can even now give up his hunger strike and consider his options objectively. That is what he should do and that is what he should be advised to do. A hunger strike achieves nothing. At this stage, there is no loss of face involved in admitting one's mistake and moving on. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To attempt to politicise the issue without a careful look at the facts is simply quite wrong and does not bode well for a self-styled responsible Opposition. The SDP has also raised the ante of the debate by suggesting that Singaporeans of conviction cannot come into politics. And that if they do so, they will be fixed by the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> PAP. The PAP Front bench should categorically deny that and reaffirm its commitment to encourage Singaporeans to participate in the political process. That is a fundamental point which goes to the very heart of our system. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not accept the SDP's actions in attempting to politicise this issue without a factual basis. It should not be condoned. I support the amendment. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, \"That the words proposed to be added, be there added\", put, and agreed to. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question now before the House is the Original Question, as amended, which is - \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That this House expresses its concern over the allegation by Dr Chee Soon Juan that his dismissal from NUS for alleged misuse of his research funds amounting to a sum of $226.00 was politically motivated, and seeks clarification from the Minister for Education of the actual facts that caused Dr Chee's dismissal and deplores the SDP's action in politicising an internal NUS disciplinary matter, and pressuring NUS to rescind its action against a dishonest staff member.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Like Mr Lee Yock Suan, I have great sympathy for Mr Chiam See Tong. I think he is in a very tight position. What we are asking Members of this House and members of the public is not to be taken in by all these technical legal jargons, but ask yourself: did or did not Dr Chee Soon Juan use research funds to send his wife's thesis to the University in USA? If he did, that is not allowed under the rules and there is no point to try and wriggle out. The way Mr Chiam tried to wriggle out by saying that this is not part of the rules and regulations reminds me of a sequence in the film A Few Good Men. Was this rule in the US Marine's rule book? In the end the prosecutor turned round and said, \"GI, do you know how to get to the mess hall?\" The GI said, \"Yes, I get there everyday.\" Is this in the rule book? It is not in the rule book, but he still gets to the mess hall. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am trying to make is how you behave depends on your sense of integrity. Not every situation needs to be \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> covered by the rule book. It is obviously wrong to send his wife's thesis to the US and charge it to the research funds. It is obviously wrong to use public funds in that fashion. That is why I think in this debate it is not about Dr Chee and his dishonest actions. The main issue I see in this debate is the issue of integrity. What is the SDP's stand on the standard of Government and the standard of public administration? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having heard the facts laid out by Dr Vasoo and Mr Lee Yock Suan, I think Mr Chiam and the SDP owe it to the public. The PAP has maintained a very high standard of integrity, corruption-free administration. Here you have a case of somebody using public funds for his own purpose. If you condone such actions, what are you signalling to the rest of Singaporeans? When I wanted to participate in this debate, I asked myself: are there similar cases? So I checked with my departments and statutory boards. Like Mr Lee Yock Suan, I am happy to report that there are very few cases of misconduct and this reflects the very high standard of integrity and honesty in the civil service. But there are a few black sheep. Let me just recount the facts of two cases and the penalties involved. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case A. This happened three years ago in HDB. Case A made a false claim to apply for a staff renovation loan of $24,000 by submitting an invoice with inflated figures when the actual cost of his renovation was only $10,000. What financial benefit did he gain? Not much. He still has to pay for the loan, only at a lower interest rate. What is involved is integrity. Case A was charged in court, convicted and dismissed from service. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Case B. This is a recent case in URA. The CPIB charged Case B in court for making false transport claims amounting to $85.25. Case B pleaded guilty, was fined $400 plus one week's jail. The URA dismissed him from service with effect from 17th February 1993, the day after he was released from jail. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we achieve our reputation as a corruption-free administration because we set high standards of honesty and integrity. Where public money is involved, we cannot accept lower standards. So when Mr Chiam argues about why the University dismissed Dr Chee under clause 4(a), giving three months' notice instead of gross misconduct, I think he is ducking the issue. The main point is that the PAP Government sets the tone of administration - one of high standards of integrity and corruption-free. Any misdeeds will be tackled. We leave it to individual departments and individual statutory boards, working within this tone of the Government, to design its own rules. In the University, I must say, like Mr Lee Yock Suan, they take a more lenient and more charitable view of Dr Chee's case and avoided the ignominy by giving him three months' notice of termination. If compared to the cases in URA and HDB, we would have charged him in court and sacked him. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am saying that the penalty of dismissal is not unusual in Dr Chee's case. The PAP Government sets a very high standard of integrity and honesty in public service and public administration. So let me pose this question to Members of this House and to the public: What does this episode of Dr Chee's dismissal say about Mr Chiam and the SDP's stand on the standard of Government and administration? This is the critical point. In my view, this is the main political issue involved. In this episode, the NUS is not on trial. The PAP is not on trial. What this episode will highlight to everybody in Singapore is the standard of integrity that the SDP sets for itself. I hope Mr Chiam will take this opportunity, having heard the facts of the case, to review his position and let the public know where does his Party stand on the standard of administration. To help him focus his mind, let me illustrate two situations which may well arise and which may well confront him in the future. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first case. Let us say the Auditor-General discovers a case of false claims and dishonesty in one of the SDP Town Councils. Let me remind Members that the Town Council is a statutory organisation and is responsible for public money. The Auditor-General recommends that the Town Council, as the employer, prosecutes the errant employee who is an SDP member. Would Mr Chiam claim that the Auditor-General's recommendation is politically motivated? I think the residents in the SDP Town Councils have a right to know what standard Mr Chiam and the SDP intend to maintain in their Town Councils. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second situation. Let us say Dr Chee Soon Juan pops up as the General Manager in one of the SDP Town Councils. I think the residents have a right to know whether he was employed on the basis of his merits in competition with other applicants for the job. Or is his appointment politically motivated? I urge Mr Chiam also to state his Party's position on this. Does the SDP treat its Town Council appointments as jobs for the boys? Does his Party believe in meritocracy and integrity in the employment of staff in its Town Councils? Is it an open system? Or is the system run by them politically motivated? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me continue. Suppose the Auditor-General audits the system of personnel appointment in the Opposition Town Councils. He is taken aback. How come all the top jobs in the SDP Town Councils are held by SDP office-bearers and members? He asked Mr Chiam for an explanation. Would Mr Chiam also claim that the Auditor-General's findings are politically motivated? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the political issue at stake today in this debate is the standard of Government and the integrity of administration. The SDP is in charge of three Town Councils. They are handling public money. I urge Mr Chiam, having heard the facts of Dr Chee's case, to review his position and state publicly for all to hear what is his and his Party's position on the \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> standard of public administration. Is he prepared to abide by the high standard of integrity and honesty that is expected by all Singaporeans? Or is his standard in fact lower, much lower? The public has a right to know. The residents in the SDP Town Councils have a right to know. Dr Chee has been proven today not to subscribe to such high standards. I urge Mr Chiam to think through the facts and to review his position. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the motion today asks for the Minister to state the facts. They have heard the facts. The facts show that the case is not politically motivated. It is a straightforward case-dismissal between employer and employee on dishonest conduct. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I seek a clarification? \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chiam, you seek clarification in a debate unless it is something which you do not understand in his speech. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> rose ---. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chia, we still have one more person who wants to speak. Prof. Jayakumar. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after the Minister for Education had given his statement, Mr Chiam said, \"Let us look at the facts and let us not be emotional.\" After the facts had been stated, and he also said that no facts had been adduced to show that Dr Chee was dishonest, I think, therefore, it is incumbent on me to restate some of the important points. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fact No. 1 is that when Dr Chee was first confronted on 4th March by Dr Vasoo and the Dean, he gave a clear admission (and these are in the notes which are approved by the Dean in the Annexes) that he was waiting for the bills to come to him to make payment. In other words, a clear admission that he should have paid for these bills, and that he should not have charged the University research funds. At no time, as I can see in the notes, did he say anything about the relevance of his wife's research. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I cannot understand, Sir, as Mr Shanmugam could not understand, why he did not go up to Dr Vasoo, or if he thought that Dr Vasoo was biased, go up to the Dean, and say, \"Dr Vasoo (or the Dean), look, I have made a mistake. I fouled it up. The matter was wrongly charged. Sorry. Here's my cheque of $226 to reimburse the University.\" I have no doubt that the matter would not have reached this stage if he had done that which, I think, any honourable member of the academic staff should have done. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, no, not Dr Chee, who, according to Mr Chiam, is a very principled man. He did not do that. From the facts we have heard in this House, Dr Chee decided to make a complete turn-around and we then have a rather incredible tale of suppression of facts, misleading information, and deviousness in a most foolish attempt to wriggle out. And I was counting the number of such attempts to wriggle out of deception and misleading statements. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number one: As I said, on 4th March, he maintained that he was waiting for the bills -- an admission that he had to pay. In fact, according to Mrs Janice Chen's note, he had personally instructed her to charge the expenditure to his research account. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number two: He then changed his story when he found out the amounts had already been charged to the research account, when Mrs Janice Chen, according to the note, reminded him that she had done so on his instructions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number three: Instead of coming clean, it looks like he decided to cook up a story -- that it was justifiable to use University funds because his wife's research was related to his own, something which, according to the documents, he never said in his meeting with Dr Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number four: He backdated his written explanation to 4th March. I was listening to Mr Chiam, and I heard Mr Chiam say that on 4th March he gave a written explanation on the same day. Same day means 4th March. But according to the documents distributed by Dr Vasoo, that is \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> not so. Dr Vasoo received the backdated letter on 9th March and the Registrar's Office, Director of Personnel, according to the chop, received it on 10th March, five days later. Sir, that a University academic can backdate a letter and stoop to such dishonest moves is unbelievable. Such acts of deviousness and dishonesty, in my view, constitute graver misconduct than the improper use of the $226. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is not all. Number five: Even in his backdated written explanation, he suppressed the material fact. And the material fact was he did not tell the University that the parcels were sent to Penn State for the purpose of his wife's PhD examination. Not one word about this! Mr Chiam says rather jokingly that, of course, it must be understood. You send a dissertation, it must be for examination. You ask any academic in the University. It does not necessarily follow. The point is that Dr Chee suppressed this. Because in his written explanation backdated to 4th March, this is what he said: \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I feel I am justified in using the funds in my research accounts for mailing the completed dissertation to the University involved so that the results could be quickly reviewed and validated and subsequently incorporated in my own research.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he never said that his wife's dissertation was sent for purposes of her PhD examination. It was for his purpose. It was only after he was confronted, according to Dr Vasoo, on 11th March, by the Director of Personnel, Dr Vasoo and the Dean, that he admitted it was for his wife's PhD examination. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number six: His claim that his wife's area of research was relevant to his own also was not true, because we have the opinions of Dr Elliot and Assoc. Prof. Ramadhar Singh. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, according to my count, six different acts of suppression and deviousness, and this does not include the tape recording and the transport claims mentioned by Dr Vasoo. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, this appears to be in character with Dr Chee. Dr Chee has shifted his ground each time the University caught him out on a false position. But it is consistent with him. In exactly the same way, in his exchange of letters with Matthias Yao in The Straits Times, the Forum page, over the last few months, he altered his claims each time his arguments were refuted. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the example of Dr Chee's letter. First, on HDB home ownership. Dr Chee initially claimed that HDB flat owners do not really own their flats. Why? Because they are on 99-year leases, not freehold. Matthias Yao then pointed out that many private condominiums and commercial developments, including Mandarin Gardens and Raffles City, are on 99-year leases. Dr Chee then shifted, abandoned this leasehold argument, and made a new claim: the real problem with HDB flats was that they were subject to too many rules and restrictions. Matthias Yao came back and said many of these rules were to protect the flat owners themselves, and private flats were also subject to such rules. Instead of acknowledging this fact, Dr Chee then shifted his argument to accusing the PAP of indulging in the politics of make-believe. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in his letters on independent schools, Dr Chee claimed that these were only for the rich, because poor Singaporeans could not afford the high fees. Matthias Yao pointed out that the Government had undertaken to provide enough scholarships and bursaries for every child who qualified for admission to independent schools but needed the help, and asked Dr Chee to name any pupil who had to forgo a place in an independent school for lack of a scholarship or bursary. Dr Chee did not do so. Instead, he shifted to attacking the feeder school system. Matthias Yao came back, pointed out that feeder schools existed long before independent schools, and not all independent schools have feeder schools. He again asked Dr Chee to name anyone who had been denied a place. This time Dr Chee admitted that no one had been turned \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> away, but claimed that this was because poor Singaporeans had been deterred from applying to independent schools in the first place. In other words, each time Dr Chee is cornered, he abandons his current position and launches a different attack. And the six different itemisation of suppression of facts, shifting of ground, deviousness is totally in character with Dr Chee that we know. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the issues here? The issue is not about $226, surely. The issue is about integrity and honesty. As the Minister for Education pointed out, integrity and honesty are important qualities in an academic institution, both for academic staff and for students, because lecturers set an example for students. We expect high standards of integrity not only in the university, but in all parts of the public service, and I would say, indeed, throughout Singapore society. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I think everyone knows that SAF officers who are caught shoplifting are cashiered, no matter how trivial the amount is. They are stripped of their officers' status, reduced to the rank of private, and discharged with ignominy. The SAF has cashiered officers who have been caught pilfering no more than a few dollars of merchandise. But this is absolutely necessary, though it may be unpleasant. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific issues are: First, was what Dr Chee did, and his subsequent conduct when being investigated by the University, right or wrong? Second, was the University right or wrong to terminate Dr Chee's contract? Was the University too harsh? Third, was Dr Chee right or wrong to try to seek redress by turning this into a political issue? Fourth, was the SDP right or wrong to espouse Dr Chee's cause in the way they did and put political pressure on NUS? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First issue, whether Dr Chee and his subsequent conduct was right or wrong. First, was Dr Chee right to use research funds to send his wife's PhD thesis by courier for purposes of her examination? The University's view was this was wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> When first confronted on 4th March, he conceded this point, but his only defence was: I expected the bills to be sent to me. As I said, he shifted his position later and claimed that he was justified because his wife's research was related to his own. But as NUS has pointed out, even if Mrs Chee's research had been related to Dr Chee's own work, it would still have been improper to use his own funds to pay for her postage. Dr Chee's claim that he was right to use the funds for his wife is really an amazing proposition. If he is right, then the logic of his argument must be that University's funds can be used for meals of his wife, for air travel to United States for purposes of her PhD examination, and a whole host of other conclusions. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when Dr Chee was investigated, was it proper for him to mislead the University as he did, backdating his letter, suppressing the facts, and so on? Obviously not. I would say all these acts of suppression and deviousness were graver misconduct than the misuse of $226. It called for further disciplinary action on the part of the University against Dr Chee. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next issue, was the University right or wrong to terminate Dr Chee's contract? Were they too harsh? I know that some people feel that Dr Chee may have been in the wrong, but the University might have acted too harshly against him. I think the University has in fact been very lenient to Dr Chee. It could have dismissed him outright at the very outset. The issue is not $226, but the dishonesty. You have heard the Minister for Education refer to other parallel cases. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have taught in the NUS for some 16 years and I was Dean of the Law Faculty for two consecutive terms. I have never during my time come across a case of a staff member resorting to so many acts of deception and deviousness simply to avoid having to pay $226 and to admit that he had done wrong. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely Dr Chee cannot expect to be let off leniently merely because he happens to have contested a by-election against the Prime Minister and is the Assistant \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> Secretary-General of the SDP. If the NUS lets him off, will that not be a signal for people less than honest to join the SDP? Is it not a signal that institutions like the NUS will have to practise double standards? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next issue, Sir, was Dr Chee right or wrong in not seeking proper redress and turning this into a political issue? Dr Chee's \"hunger strike\" achieves nothing. Even if he fasts to death, how does that help him to clear his name? Nor can putting political pressure on the University after he establishes his honour. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with others that the only proper way for Dr Chee to vindicate himself is to sue the University if he considers that the University's allegations of dishonesty are totally unfounded and defamatory. The University's strong words against Dr Chee in respect of an academic staff member of his standing should have caused anyone in a similar position to have been thoroughly outraged at such description of his character and such a person would have immediately filed suit for defamation. He did not do so. But he launched a political attack on NUS. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question everyone is asking is why did he not go to the Courts to sue NUS for defamation. He gave no explanation and Mr Chiam, today, has not given an explanation. Mr Chiam has sought to give an explanation as to why Dr Chee cannot sue the University for the three months' notice but he has not given an explanation why Dr Chee does not want to sue the University for defamation. One can only conclude that the reason must be that Dr Chee knows the NUS is fully entitled and fully justified to use those strong words. What other conclusions can one arrive at? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final issue is: was the SDP right or wrong to espouse Dr Chee's case and to put political pressure on NUS? And the actions of the SDP, Sir, are wholly deplorable. I stood up to ask whether he still stands by his statement and, obviously, he does. They have turned a staff issue between NUS and one of its \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> lecturers into a political issue. Dr Chee should have been advised by both Mr Ling and Mr Chiam, who are lawyers, that he has the proper remedy to sue for defamation. Mr Shanmugam pointed out that Mr Chiam has experience. He successfully brought defamation action and had gone on vacation on damages obtained in his suits against one or more PAP Members. But he forgot to mention that Mr Ling also has experience. Mr Ling was dismissed by the Police Force but he took legal action to challenge that dismissal and he succeeded. So both of them have personal experience in the exhaustion of remedies and the proper legal way to go about remedying a felt grievance. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if Dr Chee had been a PAP MP, not only would the PAP not have interfered with the NUS decision but Mr Goh Chok Tong would have made sure that the CEC would have immediately stripped him from any post held in the PAP CEC. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, politicians who commit wrongs do not and cannot enjoy any special immunity from retribution. It is just not possible in our system. Indeed, PAP MPs are required to uphold higher standards of rectitude than others, and expect to be given less leeway than others should they commit some misdeeds. The Government may exercise leniency with other offenders, if the offences are not serious and there are extenuating circumstances, but it will find it very hard to be lenient to its own MPs without the party and the Government being severely criticised. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SDP touts itself as the alternative government of Singapore. As a result of this episode, a big question mark hangs over it concerning its position. After this episode, the question Singaporeans must ask is whether the SDP maintains the high standards of honesty and integrity which Singaporeans have come to expect from their Government, or whether the SDP compromises principles and bends rules to protect its own members, even before gaining power. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font>\n  <br>\n  <br> \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the question is, after all the facts have been unravelled today, will the SDP continue to harbour and support Dr Chee Soon Juan? \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the motion, I asked for the truth and I said I wanted to know the truth, and the general public also wanted to know the truth. The truth has come out and I am thoroughly convinced that the action taken by NUS was not politically motivated. And the Hon. Prime Minister's assurance then at the Marine Parade GRC by-election that he would not be dismissed just because he is an Opposition candidate holds. So here we have the Minister, Dr Vasoo and all the others speaking out the facts and the facts have proved that Dr Chee did make a mistake. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam took objection to my tone. My tone was one for the big picture and, that is, the truth of the matter, and the truth has come out. The smaller one is that the action taken by Dr Chee, I thought, was inappropriate and, as Mr Shanmugam said, childish. So it is for his own good and his family's own good that he should kick off the hunger strike. If he still feels not convinced with all the facts, there is still other course of action. \n  <br>\n  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, \"That this House expresses its concern over the allegation by Dr Chee Soon Juan that his dismissal from NUS for alleged misuse of his research funds amounting to the sum of $226.00 was politically motivated and seeks clarification from the Minister for Education of the actual facts that caused Dr Chee's dismissal and deplores the SDP's action in politicising an internal NUS disciplinary matter, and pressuring NUS to rescind its action against a dishonest staff member.\" \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> You can now make your claim, Mr Chiam. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> I would like to call a division on this motion. \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon.
