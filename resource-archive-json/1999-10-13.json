There was strong  support  for  the\r\n\r\nlaunch  of  a  New Round of multilateral trade  negotiations,\r\n\r\nwhich would help lower market access barriers for Singapore's\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services.  There was also agreement on the  scope\r\n\r\nand   modalities  of  such  negotiations.  These  are  strong\r\n\r\nmessages  which would give significant impetus to efforts  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  a  New Round at the Third WTO Ministerial  Conference\r\n\r\nlater  this  year at Seattle, as APEC economies  account  for\r\n\r\nmore than half the global trade.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Zealand has ably and skilfully chaired APEC this\r\n\r\nyear towards these strong outcomes.  It has managed well  the\r\n\r\nbilateral and sub-regional side issues that had threatened to\r\n\r\novershadow the APEC meetings.  The general consensus is  that\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand has put APEC back on track, and restored a  good\r\n\r\nmeasure of the grouping's relevance and credibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fringes of the Auckland APEC meetings, Singapore\r\n\r\nannounced that we would be entering into Free Trade Agreement\r\n\r\n(FTA)  negotiations  with New Zealand.  We  also  reached  an\r\n\r\nagreement  with  Mexico  to  explore  the  possibility  of  a\r\n\r\nbilateral FTA, and with Chile and New Zealand for a study  on\r\n\r\na 3-party FTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put these FTA initiatives in perspective. While\r\n\r\nwe  pursue FTAs with strategic partners, our primary emphasis\r\n\r\nis  still the multilateral trading system represented by  the\r\n\r\nWTO.   The WTO is the only institution that can ensure a fair\r\n\r\nand  predictable  environment  for  global  trade.   This  is\r\n\r\nparticularly important for a small country heavily  dependent\r\n\r\non  trade like Singapore.  We would be much poorer off  in  a\r\n\r\nworld where trade is not governed by international rules  and\r\n\r\ndominated instead by individual economies or regional blocs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of our FTA with New Zealand and others is\r\n\r\nto  use  them  as catalysts to accelerate the pace  of  trade\r\n\r\nliberalisation within APEC.  In 1994, APEC Leaders  at  Bogor\r\n\r\nmade  a  commitment  to  achieve  free  and  open  trade  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  by 2010 for developed economies and by  2020  for\r\n\r\ndeveloping  economies.  We think that one way  to  fast-track\r\n\r\nthe achievement of the Bogor vision is through sub-APEC FTAs.\r\n\r\nAPEC economies which are ready to embrace the Bogor goals  of\r\n\r\nfree  trade  earlier should be encouraged to form FTAs  among\r\n\r\nthemselves.   Our FTA with New Zealand will  be  grounded  on\r\n\r\nBogor  goals  and  will  be open to  participation  by  other\r\n\r\neconomies.  In this way, we see the Singapore-New Zealand FTA\r\n\r\nas  being a stepping stone towards an eventual APEC-wide FTA,\r\n\r\nthus realising the Bogor vision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Auckland, we were pleasantly surprised to note that\r\n\r\nseveral  other APEC leaders shared a similar view.  They  are\r\n\r\ndiscussing  FTAs  among themselves, for  example,  Korea  and\r\n\r\nChile, Japan and Mexico.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore remains committed to ASEAN and the\r\n\r\nestablishment of a strong ASEAN Free Trade Area  (AFTA)  that\r\n\r\nis  attractive  to  investors.  This is in our  own  interest\r\n\r\nbecause  our  long-term  fortunes are  inextricably  tied  to\r\n\r\nASEAN.   Our  FTA  initiatives  will  not  detract  from  our\r\n\r\ncommitments  and obligations in ASEAN.  We will  continue  to\r\n\r\nwork  hard for the implementation of the AFTA Agreement,  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  Agreement on Services, the ASEAN Investment  Area  and\r\n\r\nother ASEAN economic initiatives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decision to enter into FTAs with other trading\r\n\r\npartners  can  help  to strengthen the region.   We  see  the\r\n\r\nSingapore-New Zealand FTA as a preliminary step to  build  up\r\n\r\nlinkages  between ASEAN and other regions, for  example,  the\r\n\r\nCloser Economic Relations (CER) grouping of Australia and New\r\n\r\nZealand.

That was the  whole\r\n\r\nidea  -   to bring forward the payment of the stamp  duty  so\r\n\r\nthat  only bona fide purchasers, who have real intent to  buy\r\n\r\nproperty,  will go into a transaction and they pay the  cost.\r\n\r\nThis is to deter speculation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when stamp duty was paid at the end of the\r\n\r\ntransaction, it did not cost very much for somebody  to  take\r\n\r\nout  an  option, speculate on a property, and if  the  market\r\n\r\ntakes a downturn, abort the transaction.  So this measure  of\r\n\r\nbringing  it  forward  is  part  and  parcel  of  the   anti-speculation package in 1996.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government had thought through the consequences\r\n\r\nof  bringing forward the payment of the stamp duty.

Based on the reason that he outlined, for  bona\r\n\r\nfide  buyers who cannot complete the transaction for whatever\r\n\r\nreason,  they are still obligated to pay the stamp duty,  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  surely  not  the  intent  of  the  anti-speculation\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, I have already explained the\r\n\r\nreason for bringing forward the payment.

This is  because  HDB\r\n\r\ntakes  into account wage increases when adjusting  prices  of\r\n\r\nnew  flats.  In this way, the Government ensures that new HDB\r\n\r\nflats remain affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of the table, maybe I will just go\r\n\r\nthrough the table which is very simple.  Let me say that  the\r\n\r\nmonthly  wage increase over the last five years is  about  6%\r\n\r\nper  annum.  If it is over the last 10 years, it is about  7%\r\n\r\nper  annum.   Whereas for new HDB flat prices,  the  increase\r\n\r\nover the last 5 years is about 5% per annum, as opposed to 6%\r\n\r\nfor the increase in monthly wages.  And the increase over the\r\n\r\nlast  10  years is 7% per annum, as opposed to 7%  per  annum\r\n\r\nincrease for the monthly wages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For resale HDB flat prices, the increase over the last 5\r\n\r\nyears  is  7%  per annum, and the increase over the  last  10\r\n\r\nyears is 12% per annum.  For private condominium prices,  the\r\n\r\nincrease  over  the  last 5 years is 0% per  annum,  and  the\r\n\r\nincrease over the last 10 years is 9% per annum.  Sir,  as  I\r\n\r\nhave  said earlier, the Government ensures that new HDB flats\r\n\r\nremain affordable to the majority of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, prices of resale HDB flats are\r\n\r\ndetermined  by market forces.  Resale flats cater  mainly  to\r\n\r\nHDB  upgraders who have the benefit of capital gains from the\r\n\r\nsale  of their previous HDB flats.  First-timers who wish  to\r\n\r\npurchase  resale  flats can apply for the CPF  Housing  Grant\r\n\r\nScheme.   The  grant, which is as much as $40,000  for  those\r\n\r\napplying to live near their parents, can be used to  pay  for\r\n\r\nthe downpayment of the resale\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflats.   In  this  way, the Government helps to  enhance  the\r\n\r\naffordability of resale flats for first-timers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for private condominiums, current prices are at the\r\n\r\nsame level as 5 years ago. Over the last 10 years, as I said,\r\n\r\ncondominium  prices  have increased at about  9%  per  annum,\r\n\r\nwhich is slightly higher than the corresponding wage increase\r\n\r\nof 7% per annum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prices and affordability of private residential\r\n\r\nproperties  are determined by the market.  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nset prices for private property, like new HDB flats. However,\r\n\r\nGovernment can and will ensure that there is sufficient  land\r\n\r\nset aside for private housing to meet the medium term demand.\r\n\r\nThis  is  done under the regular Government land sales  (GLS)\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The Government will also ensure regular  release\r\n\r\nof  comprehensive  and accurate information  on  the  private\r\n\r\nproperty market to enable buyers and sellers to make informed\r\n\r\ndecisions.  In this way, the Government can contribute  to  a\r\n\r\nstable  property market, where prices generally move in  line\r\n\r\nwith prevailing economic conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I have two\r\n\r\nsupplementary questions for the Minister of State.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nwhat  would the Minister of State consider to be entry  level\r\n\r\nhousing,  and whether the increase in the selling  prices  of\r\n\r\nsuch  housing  has actually kept pace with  the  increase  in\r\n\r\nwages for the relevant segment of the population?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, given the faster increase in prices of resale\r\n\r\nflats,  whether  the  revision  of  the  income  ceiling  for\r\n\r\neligibility for direct purchase from HDB has taken this  into\r\n\r\naccount, and whether these have been made in tandem with  the\r\n\r\nwage  increase  for  first-timers; specifically,  whether  at\r\n\r\nleast  the  same percentage of people is eligible  with  each\r\n\r\nrevision of the income ceiling?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, for entry level, if you\r\n\r\nlook at the 4-room flats and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  the average income household of, say, $2,700, it  would\r\n\r\nusually take about 4-5 years for the couple to be able to pay\r\n\r\nthe  20% downpayment for the flat, and thereafter paying only\r\n\r\nabout 17% of their household income for the monthly mortgage,\r\n\r\nand   that   17%  can  be  paid  fully  through   their   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions.   Therefore, we can say that  it  is  actually\r\n\r\nvery affordable.  The entry level is actually quite low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the ceiling, we have revised the ceiling over the\r\n\r\nyears.  Let me give the Member some indication of the ceiling\r\n\r\nrevision.   In 1989, it was about $5,000 for 3-,  4-,  5-room\r\n\r\nand  Executive flats.  For an extended family, it was $8,000,\r\n\r\nie,  3-tier family which includes the grandparents.  In 1991,\r\n\r\nwe  revised it to $6,000; in 1992, $7,000; 1994, $8,000.   In\r\n\r\n1995,  with  the  introduction of the Executive  Condominiums\r\n\r\n(EC), we raised it to $10,000, for applicants to qualify  for\r\n\r\nEC.   In  1996,  we  had the anti-speculation  measures,  and\r\n\r\nfollowed  by the economic crisis.  So, since then, there  was\r\n\r\nno revision for the ceiling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give the Member some statistics to put the\r\n\r\nissue  in  perspective.  If you look at applicants who  apply\r\n\r\nfor 4-room and 5-room flats, which is in the range of $7,000-$8,000, it is less than 1% of the applicants who apply for 4-and  5-room flats and who are in the monthly income range  of\r\n\r\n$7,000-$8,000.   It  shows  that  the  large   majority   are\r\n\r\nbasically up to $5,000 monthly income, which means  that  the\r\n\r\nincome  ceiling  is  pretty generous.  In fact,  the  $10,000\r\n\r\nincome  ceiling  covers  92%  of  the  Singaporean  household\r\n\r\nincome.  I would say that if you look at the long-term target\r\n\r\nof  the  proportion  of Singaporeans who own  public  housing\r\n\r\nversus  private housing, it is 75% versus 25%.  So,  I  would\r\n\r\nsay that at this income ceiling, it is really very generous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>KIDNAPPING</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Publicity on laws and punishment)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs (a)\r\n\r\nwhether  the team that handled the recent case of  kidnapping\r\n\r\nhas been highly commended, and (b) whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  are  plans to publicise widely our laws and punishment\r\n\r\nconcerning  kidnapping,  especially  to  foreigners  in   the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

As  in  all\r\n\r\nsuch   cases,   officers  who  excel  will  be  appropriately\r\n\r\nrecognised by the Police and my Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent kidnapping case attracted extensive\r\n\r\nmedia coverage for about a week.  During this time, the press\r\n\r\nrepeatedly  publicised that the serious offence of kidnapping\r\n\r\nattracts  the  death penalty.  There will be  more  publicity\r\n\r\nwhen  the  case goes to Court.  I am sure that the swift  and\r\n\r\nresolute  action  of CID is additional strong  deterrence  to\r\n\r\nwould-be kidnappers.  Foreigners are also warned of the tough\r\n\r\nlaws in Singapore when they come to our country to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>BICYCLISTS TRAVELLING ALONG PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Regulations)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng</b> asked the Minister for Home\r\n\r\nAffairs (a) whether there are regulations for bicyclists when\r\n\r\ntravelling along public thoroughfares to ensure the safety of\r\n\r\nthemselves and other road-users; and (b) if there  are,  what\r\n\r\nis  the  number  of bicyclists caught for violation  of  such\r\n\r\nregulations  for  the past year as well  as  the  punishments\r\n\r\nmeted out for such violations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc.

Additionally,  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  (Bicycle) Rules set out the manner in which cyclists\r\n\r\nshould  conduct  themselves whilst on the  road.   They  also\r\n\r\nstipulate  safety requirements such as brakes and  headlamps.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nensure  the  safety  of the cyclists as well  as  other  road\r\n\r\nusers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Traffic Police issued 115 summonses to\r\n\r\ncyclists.   These  were  for more serious  offences  such  as\r\n\r\nriding  against  the flow of traffic and  riding  abreast  of\r\n\r\nother  cyclists.   A  typical composition  fine  of  $20  was\r\n\r\nimposed.

I  want  to  assure the Member that what  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  will do is to step up public education.  This is  one\r\n\r\nfocus  where Traffic Police will put more effort, targetting,\r\n\r\nin  particular,  the elderly, working through,  for  example,\r\n\r\nSAGE  and the People's Association as well as foreign workers\r\n\r\nthrough their employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I do not believe it is a\r\n\r\nmatter  of subjective view.  Would the Minister of State  ask\r\n\r\nsome  company  to  do  a survey because,  currently,  without\r\n\r\nregistration,  most bicycles are used on  the  roads  without\r\n\r\nheadlights or reflector lights at night.  And very often, for\r\n\r\nsome  strange  reasons,  the bicyclists  normally  wear  dark\r\n\r\nclothings, making them both a danger to themselves as well as\r\n\r\nto  other  road  users.   Just for the  Minister  of  State's\r\n\r\ninformation,  I  had  a personal experience  where  I  nearly\r\n\r\nknocked  into a bicyclist.  Thereafter, I made it a point  to\r\n\r\nobserve  such bicyclists on the roads.

Autism occurs in varying degrees of  severity.\r\n\r\nWith  the  appropriate  training, the  majority  of  autistic\r\n\r\npersons can remain in the community.  The National Council of\r\n\r\nSocial   Service   (NCSS)   and  the   Autistic   Association\r\n\r\n(Singapore) in a joint effort started the Autism Youth Centre\r\n\r\n(AYC)  in March this year.  The AYC provides autistic  youths\r\n\r\naged between 12 and 21 years with social and learning skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AYC has just been allocated new premises at an HDB\r\n\r\nvoid deck at Hougang Avenue 6, and will move there as soon as\r\n\r\nrenovations are completed.  This location will enable AYC  to\r\n\r\nreach out to more autistic persons and help them to integrate\r\n\r\nbetter with the mainstream community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another VWO effort is the Christian Outreach to the\r\n\r\nHandicapped's  day  activity  centre  which  trains  autistic\r\n\r\nyouths  aged  between 13 and 18 years in  independent  living\r\n\r\nskills  (such as taking a bath, making simple meals, sweeping\r\n\r\nthe  floor,  making  their own beds and  clearing  their  own\r\n\r\nthings).

Those  who\r\n\r\nreally  cannot  do  so,  we will send  them  to  the  special\r\n\r\nschools.   Based  on the UK experience, it is estimated  that\r\n\r\nfor every 500 persons there will be one autistic person.

The\r\n\r\nunions and the union leaders are particularly happy with  the\r\n\r\nsections  on people development, on education of  the  young,\r\n\r\nand  on life-long learning.  For people development must mean\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers development of workers.  Education  of  the\r\n\r\nyoung  must  mean helping future generations of  workers  fit\r\n\r\ninto  the  future economy.   The call for life-long  learning\r\n\r\nand the provision of infrastructure and support for life-long\r\n\r\nlearning must also mean that workers will be helped to remain\r\n\r\nemployable, competitive and effective in the future  economy.\r\n\r\nSo  the Government's initiatives help and prepare our workers\r\n\r\nfor the knowledge-based economy that we are entering into  in\r\n\r\nthe next millennium.  So our unions welcome and fully support\r\n\r\nthe initiatives outlined in the President's Address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Dr Lee Boon Yang, the Minister for Manpower,\r\n\r\nelaborated  on some of the schemes that are being offered  to\r\n\r\nthe workers.  I am sure the unions are particularly reassured\r\n\r\nby his message that the Government will continue to invest in\r\n\r\npeople  and  plan for the future.  He shared  with  us  three\r\n\r\ntrends  that workers in Singapore will face and be challenged\r\n\r\nby.   The unions do recognise these trends and also share the\r\n\r\nsame  concerns.  The unions will help our workers to overcome\r\n\r\nthe  challenges.  Indeed, it is like us facing a wave of  the\r\n\r\nbeaches  of Hawaii or Miami.  And if we are not prepared  for\r\n\r\nthe big wave, we will be thrown off or even drown.  But if we\r\n\r\nhave  a  surfboard  and if we have learnt  how  to  surf  and\r\n\r\nbalance on that surfboard, then when the next big wave comes,\r\n\r\nwe  can  ride  that  wave smoothly and quickly  to  shallower\r\n\r\nwaters  and, hopefully, reach the beach.  So the unions  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Government and employers will help our workers ride\r\n\r\nthe waves as they come.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also mentioned that we ought to review the\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits.  When this subject was brought up  not\r\n\r\nlong ago, the unions came together for a quick discussion  on\r\n\r\nwhat  this meant for workers.  I would like to take a bit  of\r\n\r\ntime  to  reflect what the grassroots leaders in  the  unions\r\n\r\nfeel about this subject.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, retrenchment benefits are capped at 25 years\r\n\r\nof  service.  This was discussed only in 1997 and implemented\r\n\r\nonly  on  1st January 1999.  This is a new cap.  Before  this\r\n\r\nthere was no cap.  So this new structure is in place only for\r\n\r\nless  than a year.  And the union leaders feel that it  is  a\r\n\r\nbit  too early to talk about a review when the new system has\r\n\r\nnot worked for very long.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we have observed that in the last two years when\r\n\r\nretrenchments  took place, workers who were  retrenched  took\r\n\r\nlonger to find a new job.  Retrenchment benefits are to  help\r\n\r\nthem  tide  over the period of unemployment.  In good  times,\r\n\r\nworkers  perhaps will be able to find new jobs very  quickly.\r\n\r\nBut  if  we  enter  into a new prolonged recession,  and  the\r\n\r\nquestion is not \"if\" but \"when\" we do so - we lower the caps,\r\n\r\nwould the new retrenchment benefits quantum be sufficient  to\r\n\r\nhelp  our  workers  pay  for  their  household  expenses  and\r\n\r\nexpenses incurred in looking for a new job?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in the last two years, older workers who were\r\n\r\nretrenched found new jobs at lower pay.  And they  will  face\r\n\r\ndifficulties meeting the household expenditures  at  the  new\r\n\r\nlevel of pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in sum, Mr Speaker, the union leaders feel that\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits  are  not  a  windfall.   Retrenchment\r\n\r\nbenefits are a buffer against an unknown future for a  worker\r\n\r\nwho  is retrenched.  And so we do have to look very carefully\r\n\r\nat  the principles of applying retrenchment benefit caps  and\r\n\r\nthe desired outcomes of the new structure we want to look at.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, there were many workers retrenched in the\r\n\r\nlast two years who did not receive any benefits.  And that is\r\n\r\nbecause  under the law, employers need not give any  benefits\r\n\r\nto retrenched\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nworkers.  So surely as we review the caps, we ought  to  also\r\n\r\nreview the situation where retrenched workers get no benefits\r\n\r\nin  those  companies that do not have a collective  agreement\r\n\r\nwith their workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we welcome the Minister's assurance that we will\r\n\r\nhave  a tripartite study into this issue.  We would urge that\r\n\r\nwe  should  take time to do the study and not rush  into  it,\r\n\r\nthat  we should carefully weigh the principles that go behind\r\n\r\nretrenchment  benefits,  and we  should  choose  the  desired\r\n\r\noutcomes  very carefully.  But, on the whole, we welcome  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  assurance  that  the  Ministry  will   urge   the\r\n\r\nemployers to streamline the wage structure so as to make  our\r\n\r\nworkers more competitive in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move into the knowledge-based economy, as we\r\n\r\nhave  all  these  schemes and courses  to  help  our  workers\r\n\r\nprepare  for  the  new  type  of economy,  some  workers  are\r\n\r\nworried.  They are worried that they cannot learn new  skills\r\n\r\nand  new knowledge.  They are worried that if they are placed\r\n\r\nin classes where there are younger workers, will they be able\r\n\r\nto  learn  as quickly as those young workers?  Will  they  be\r\n\r\nholding back the classes?  When I hear these worries, this is\r\n\r\nsomething which I try to help assure them with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us are parents. Many of our workers are\r\n\r\nparents.  How do we bring up a baby?  There are no Government\r\n\r\nsubsidies  and  SRP plans.  We do not go for formal  courses.\r\n\r\nWe do not ask for employers to give us subsidised training to\r\n\r\nbring  up  our baby.  What do we do?  We learn.  We  ask  our\r\n\r\nparents.   We ask our grandparents, our colleagues  who  have\r\n\r\nchildren.   And  along the way, as the baby  grows  from  one\r\n\r\nmonth to a year, to PSLE, to \"O\" levels, we continually learn\r\n\r\nand  re-learn  and  respond as our child  grows.   No  formal\r\n\r\ncourses, no subsidies.  We do that until the child grows  up,\r\n\r\ngets  to work, and even as he or she marries, we want to help\r\n\r\nhim  choose the right spouse.  And we learn how these  should\r\n\r\nbe  done  -  all  on our own, and in a continual  process  of\r\n\r\nlearning  and re-learning and responding to each child  in  a\r\n\r\ndifferent way from\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanother  child.  So all of us can learn and do learn all  the\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why is it that we need to tell workers to be thinking\r\n\r\nworkers  and learning workers?  Is it not strange, Sir,  that\r\n\r\npeople,  the  only  creatures on earth  who  are  capable  of\r\n\r\nthinking, of exercising judgement, are asked to think and  to\r\n\r\nlearn?  Before Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam says that it is because the\r\n\r\nPAP puts fear into people, let me suggest the answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the old days when people were farmers or\r\n\r\nhunters,  everyone was a knowledge worker.  If a  farmer  was\r\n\r\nnot  a  knowledge worker, he would starve.  Because  he  must\r\n\r\nread  the  weather and make sure that the pests do  not  come\r\n\r\nafter  his crops and know how to deal with those pests.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  the floods come, when the droughts come, what  does  he\r\n\r\ndo?   He learns all the time.  And then he grows a good  crop\r\n\r\nand  he  becomes a good farmer.  Otherwise,  he  starves.   A\r\n\r\nhunter must be a knowledge hunter, otherwise he gets eaten up\r\n\r\nby wild animals, and that is the end of the hunter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we went into the industrial economy, something\r\n\r\nchanged.    The   industrial  economy  made  workers   become\r\n\r\nmachines.  When one man used to make one chair in a week,  we\r\n\r\nspread out the job over several people.  One person just does\r\n\r\nthe legs, somebody sews the cushions and somebody hammers the\r\n\r\nwhole  chair  together.  That team produces many more  chairs\r\n\r\nthan  if  one person makes one chair, a complete  chair.   So\r\n\r\nwhat  do we do in that industrial economy situation?  We must\r\n\r\nspread  out  the  work so that each one just does  his  part,\r\n\r\nfollowing  all the specifications, no deviations, and  passes\r\n\r\nthat part to the next person so that person receives the part\r\n\r\nas  he expects it.  No deviation was allowed; no thinking was\r\n\r\nallowed.    We  did  that  because  the  machines  were   not\r\n\r\nsophisticated  enough to do the thinking,  and  the  machines\r\n\r\nwere  not sophisticated enough to do things that people could\r\n\r\ndo because of our dexterity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But today we have moved yet again, because the machines,\r\n\r\nthe robots, the computers, can do many things in a more\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndexterous  way,  in a more precise way than people  can.   So\r\n\r\nthose  machines can do things better than people.  Then  what\r\n\r\ndo  people do?  Sir, I would like to share an example that is\r\n\r\ntaken  from  Honda.   Recently,  Honda  in  Japan  wanted  to\r\n\r\nstreamline its process of producing cars.  They had different\r\n\r\nlines  to  produce  different  model  cars  because  it   was\r\n\r\ndifficult  for machines and computers to convert or  use  the\r\n\r\nsame  production line to produce different models.  What they\r\n\r\nhad  done recently was to put some workers to manipulate  the\r\n\r\nproduction  line so that different models could  be  produced\r\n\r\nfrom  the  same line.  And this could be done only by  people\r\n\r\nbecause  the  people there manning the job  could  think  and\r\n\r\nexercise  judgement and make those changes as  required  that\r\n\r\nmachines could not do.  So post-industrial revolution, in the\r\n\r\nknowledge  economy,  people are employed to  become  thinking\r\n\r\nworkers again.  And this is a situation we are in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, knowledge and the knowledge-based economy are\r\n\r\nnot about knowledge workers alone.  The knowledge economy has\r\n\r\ngot  knowledge products, products that embody knowledge, that\r\n\r\nhave  got all the knowledge built in, so that we do not  have\r\n\r\nto  do  the  thinking.   The machines do  all  the  thinking.\r\n\r\nKnowledge-based  economy also has knowledge processes  as  in\r\n\r\nthe Honda example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is there great value for knowledge in the knowledge-based economy? Let me give an example of how knowledge is so\r\n\r\nvaluable and yet costs practically nothing.  Recently,  in  a\r\n\r\nsupermarket in America, they installed a new computer.   That\r\n\r\ncomputer  could collect data on what customers bought.   They\r\n\r\ndiscovered something very interesting, which is - people  who\r\n\r\nbought disposable nappies also bought beer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found this very strange and sent people to observe\r\n\r\nwhy people bought beer and nappies.  And they discovered that\r\n\r\nwhen  a family has a new baby, the father takes leave to look\r\n\r\nafter  the  baby and goes to the supermarket to  buy  things,\r\n\r\nincluding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnappies.   And  because he is at home, watching  baseball  or\r\n\r\nfootball on TV, he also buys beer.  So that is why people who\r\n\r\nbought  nappies  also bought beer.  In the  supermarket,  the\r\n\r\nnappies  were  placed in one section with the baby  products,\r\n\r\nand  the  beer was placed in the alcoholic products  section.\r\n\r\nWhat  the supermarket manager did was to put some shelves  of\r\n\r\nbeer  next to the nappies section, and sale of beer  went  up\r\n\r\ntremendously.  Here is an example of knowledge  acquired  and\r\n\r\nknowledge applied, and the application of the knowledge costs\r\n\r\nnothing.  It costs nothing to move the shelf of beer next  to\r\n\r\nthe nappies.  Yet sales went up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So application of knowledge is not just about IT, about\r\n\r\ntechnology.   Technology is important, but  it  is  not  just\r\n\r\nabout  that.   It  is also not just about individual  workers\r\n\r\nbeing  trained  to learn and re-learn new knowledge  and  new\r\n\r\nskills,  because individual workers working on their own  are\r\n\r\nalso not enough.  The harnessing of knowledge is a collective\r\n\r\neffort.  It is a team effort within a small group, within the\r\n\r\ncompany, within the whole industry, within the whole economy.\r\n\r\nIt is a collective effort.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our tourist industry, we have thousands of\r\n\r\nworkers  employed in the tourist industry -  hotel  managers,\r\n\r\nwaitresses, taxi-drivers, tour guides.  Suppose we  are  able\r\n\r\nto  harness the knowledge of all these workers about tourists\r\n\r\nwho  come to Singapore.  Every tourist who comes to Singapore\r\n\r\nlooks for something to eat, see or do.  Our taxi-drivers know\r\n\r\nthat  Japanese tourists like to go to certain places;  German\r\n\r\ntourists like to go to yet other places.  If we could harness\r\n\r\nall that knowledge, we will be able to target our advertising\r\n\r\nmessages to individual countries in a sharper way to  attract\r\n\r\nmany  more tourist arrivals.  If only we can harness all that\r\n\r\nknowledge  that exists among all the workers in  the  tourism\r\n\r\nindustry, how much and how rich that knowledge will be.   And\r\n\r\nit is not just a question of knowledge.  Everyone has his own\r\n\r\nexperience.  We need to extract them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to propose to do something. Sir, in the\r\n\r\n70s, 80s, early 90s, our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemphasis  was on productivity.  We went all over  the  world,\r\n\r\nincluding Japan, to learn about productivity tools -  quality\r\n\r\ncircles, QCCs, WITs, five \"S\"s, and other tools, to  help  us\r\n\r\nbecome   more   productive.   And   we   systematically   and\r\n\r\nconscientiously developed the Quality Circle movement so that\r\n\r\nevery  worker in Singapore has a set of simple tools that  he\r\n\r\ncan apply to become more productive as a worker in a team, in\r\n\r\nthe company.  How wonderful it would be if we had a tool that\r\n\r\ncould  help  us  acquire  knowledge, share  knowledge,  apply\r\n\r\nknowledge  and  generate new knowledge in a  way  that  would\r\n\r\nbring  together  knowledge, multiply, branch  off,  converge,\r\n\r\ndiverge  and  get new ideas constantly out of old  knowledge.\r\n\r\nAnd  more  important,  Sir, if we can have  a  tool  that  is\r\n\r\ntransportable,  that  is easily taught,  easily  learned.   A\r\n\r\nworker  learns  to use this tool.  When he  goes  to  another\r\n\r\ncompany, he can use the same tool and transport it to another\r\n\r\nteam,  to  another  workplace  and  continue  to  help   that\r\n\r\nworkplace,  that  company acquire and  share  knowledge,  and\r\n\r\ngenerate knowledge.  How wonderful that would be.  There  may\r\n\r\nbe  such tools existing; let us learn them.  There may not be\r\n\r\nsuch tools existing; then let us invent that tool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are able to harness all that knowledge for our\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  economy, then perhaps we need  to  change  a\r\n\r\ncertain  mantra that we chant.  Sir, you will recognise  this\r\n\r\nmantra.   Once in a while, it comes out in this  House.   And\r\n\r\nthe  mantra is: \"Singapore is a small country with no natural\r\n\r\nresources.  Our people are our only resource.\"  It has become\r\n\r\na  cliche.  People do not want to use it nowadays.  But it is\r\n\r\nan important statement.  It reminds us of our constraints and\r\n\r\nvulnerabilities.  But it also gives us hope that, as a  small\r\n\r\ncountry, we can succeed, we can survive, we can achieve.  But\r\n\r\nif we are able to harness knowledge collectively, then we can\r\n\r\nchange that statement to something like this: \"Singapore is a\r\n\r\nsmall  country with no natural resources.  Knowledge  is  our\r\n\r\nonly resource.\"  And if we adopt that as a working principle,\r\n\r\nthen  something changes.  Our horizon broadens  tremendously.\r\n\r\nBecause if we look at people as\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour resource, then the population is small.  But knowledge is\r\n\r\nlimitless.  Population grows slowly, but knowledge multiplies\r\n\r\nand  multiplies  rapidly  given the right  environment.   Our\r\n\r\npeople  have  mental and physical limits.  But  knowledge  is\r\n\r\ninexhaustible.   And if we are able to find the  right  tools\r\n\r\nthat   are   easily   learned,  easily  taught   and   easily\r\n\r\ntransportable, then we will thrive and stay one step ahead in\r\n\r\nthe future global knowledge-based competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address also contains statements on\r\n\r\nManpower  21.   Manpower  21  is  a  bold  and  comprehensive\r\n\r\nblueprint.  It has got six strategies to build Singapore into\r\n\r\na talent capital.  Again, Sir, the unions are in full support\r\n\r\nof  Manpower  21.   NTUC  would  like  to  support  it  -  in\r\n\r\nparticular, in three areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on the manpower information system. It is a\r\n\r\nsystem that will give information about job availability, the\r\n\r\ntrends  and the courses available, and so on.  This would  be\r\n\r\nvery helpful to workers.  The unions have asked to be closely\r\n\r\ninvolved in the development of this system, because it should\r\n\r\nnot  be a system that can be understood and used only  by  IT\r\n\r\nexperts.   The ordinary worker should be able to  access  the\r\n\r\nsystem  and get all this knowledge in a simple form  that  he\r\n\r\ncan use and apply to help himself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, on the National Skills Recognition System. It\r\n\r\nis  a  very  exciting new concept.  It is a  way  of  testing\r\n\r\nworkers  for  the skills that they have already  learned  and\r\n\r\nqualifying  them in modular ways, in bite-size ways  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  acquire qualifications to do the jobs, not just in  the\r\n\r\ncompany, but if the company closes down or restructures, they\r\n\r\ncan  use  that  qualification to apply for  a  job  in  other\r\n\r\ncompanies in the industry.  In Manpower 21, it says:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It facilitates learning among less educated workers and\r\n\r\nNSRS  courses  should have flexible entry  requirements.   It\r\n\r\nmust be a flexible and dynamic system that can be continually\r\n\r\nupdated to incorporate new industries and to reflect changing\r\n\r\nskills needs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the NTUC will help to identify these needs with MOM\r\n\r\nand  with  the employers.  But what we ask is this: that  the\r\n\r\ntests\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould  be  to  allow workers to qualify, to  allow  in  more\r\n\r\nworkers  who  otherwise  are not  considered  qualified.   It\r\n\r\nshould  not be a system that becomes bureaucratic  over  time\r\n\r\nand  with  tests  that keep workers out so that  they  remain\r\n\r\nunqualified for jobs in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in the Manpower 21 plan, there is a section that\r\n\r\nencourages   the   promotion  of  best  HR  practices   among\r\n\r\ncompanies.  Sir, we think it is a very good thing to do,  but\r\n\r\npromotion of best HR practices should not remain at the level\r\n\r\nof  holding  seminars and getting consultants to  talk  about\r\n\r\nwhat are good practices.  NTUC would like to suggest that  we\r\n\r\ngo  three  steps further.  First, HR practitioners, SNEF  and\r\n\r\nthe  HR institute in Singapore should draw up a code of  good\r\n\r\nHR  practices.  A simple code that tells everyone:  in a good\r\n\r\ncompany,  for  a  good  employer, what  constitutes  good  HR\r\n\r\nmanagement? This is so that we can all understand and respond\r\n\r\nto that code.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the NTUC will contribute to that process by\r\n\r\ndrawing  up  at  the  same  time a code  of  good  industrial\r\n\r\nrelations  (IR)  practices because we are a  responsible  and\r\n\r\nresponsive  union  movement and we would  like  to  place  on\r\n\r\nrecord  the  kind  of trade union movement  we  want  to  be.\r\n\r\nThird,  we should put together these two parts, the  HR  code\r\n\r\nand  the  IR  code,  as a statement of the  kind  of  labour-management  relations we wish to achieve in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\ncode  can  be a simplified one with terms that can easily  be\r\n\r\nunderstood  and implemented.  Each company can  either  adopt\r\n\r\nthis code or adapt from it to suit the company's missions and\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should add a third part to the two sections, which is\r\n\r\na  statement  of shared vision and shared future between  the\r\n\r\nworkers  and the management of the companies.  And  together,\r\n\r\nthis   document  will  tell  everyone  -  the  workers,   the\r\n\r\nmanagement - what is expected of each side.  The codes should\r\n\r\nnot  be  just words.  Each code, when drawn up, should  be  a\r\n\r\nstatement of commitment by HR, by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nemployers  and  by the unions, of the kind of strong  labour-management relations we want to form in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is a very comprehensive\r\n\r\none.   The  workers' concerns were addressed, and the  unions\r\n\r\nand I would like to support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwish  to  speak in support of the motion in the  name  of  Mr\r\n\r\nDavinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fitting that the thrust of the Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress  is  to  exhort  Singaporeans  to  build  our  future\r\n\r\ntogether.   The  problems  that  Singaporeans  face  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   economy  faces  are  quite  challenging.    These\r\n\r\nproblems  affect all of us Singaporeans, whether heartlanders\r\n\r\nor cosmopolitans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not subscribe to this differentiation\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans.  I feel it is unnecessary.  We know in  any\r\n\r\ncountry, whether in China, the United States, the UK,  India,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  or  Singapore, there will always be  some  who,  by\r\n\r\ntheir capabilities, by their connection, would have access to\r\n\r\nhigher  education or opportunities to work with  people  from\r\n\r\nmany countries, travel internationally for work and business.\r\n\r\nThese  people, by their training and work and command of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  Language  or  a  second language,  can  work  in  an\r\n\r\noverseas country.  These people succeed in large measure  due\r\n\r\nto the opportunities which their societies gave them in their\r\n\r\nformative  years.  We should therefore try to  give  everyone\r\n\r\nthe  maximum opportunities to excel and go far.  We know that\r\n\r\nnot  all of us start life equally.  But we have done  so  for\r\n\r\nmany  years.   So  I feel it is not necessary  to  make  that\r\n\r\ndistinction  now and remind people that there  are  different\r\n\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there really such distinct categories? I wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  all  the maids and construction workers and  factory\r\n\r\noperators  from  the  developing countries  who  go  to  work\r\n\r\noverseas  and  earn relatively high income to  send  home  to\r\n\r\ntheir compatriots will be considered 'cosmopolitans' in their\r\n\r\nown countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to take the approach which the Education\r\n\r\nMinister  yesterday elaborated - to educate all  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  be \"world-ready and yet rooted in Singapore\".  I am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  the Education Minister reiterated that the teaching  of\r\n\r\nvalues  to  our students has not been forgotten to make  them\r\n\r\ncommitted to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer this simpler way of forging a nation - the\r\n\r\nbetter  educated,  more  capable,  knowing  their  roots  and\r\n\r\nidentified  with  the  national values, the  national  goals,\r\n\r\nprepared  to  work  for the betterment  of  his  country  and\r\n\r\nfellowmen.   If we continue to teach our young to  be  world-ready  and  yet rooted in Singapore, we would not lose  them,\r\n\r\njust  because of globalisation and the IT culture.  And these\r\n\r\nvalues  of  commitment  are equally  relevant  in  a  modern,\r\n\r\ntechnological, knowledge-based economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we teach our children that they should be\r\n\r\nproud of the Singapore heritage, of how the country and their\r\n\r\nparents  and brothers and sisters have done well against  all\r\n\r\nthe  odds, all Singaporeans will be inspired by the Singapore\r\n\r\nStory.   Their hearts beat as one.  The moment we  categorise\r\n\r\nthem into heartlanders and cosmopolitans, we are creating  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary divide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our economy faces many serious challenges in the\r\n\r\nyears  ahead.  It is not just about going by how many percent\r\n\r\nper year.  It is really about how we can sustain a meaningful\r\n\r\nquality of life for our workforce, our working population and\r\n\r\na  rapidly  ageing  one - a large portion of  whom  may  find\r\n\r\nincreasing difficulties in staying employed with an  adequate\r\n\r\nincome.  Many of them need to continue working to be able  to\r\n\r\nlive comfortably.  There are about 700,000 workers in the  45\r\n\r\nyears  and above category with only a secondary two level  of\r\n\r\neducation.  In a rapidly changing economy, there is always  a\r\n\r\ndanger  of  not being able to stay employed.  The  impact  of\r\n\r\nthis  on  our  social  fabric  is  something  deserving   our\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest challenges our Government and\r\n\r\neconomy  will face is to set forth the platform and strategic\r\n\r\nimplementation   for  our  training  and  skills   retraining\r\n\r\nprogrammes  for  our  people  to  launch  and  implement  the\r\n\r\nManpower 21 plan.  The National Skills Recognition Scheme and\r\n\r\nthe   'one   institution  two  systems'  approach'   in   our\r\n\r\neducational  and  training  institutes  are  very   important\r\n\r\npillars.  We must implement this fast because there  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle  time.   The  sooner  we  implement  this  across  our\r\n\r\nindustries,  the  better chance we give our  people  to  stay\r\n\r\ncompetitive and give them a better chance to a better quality\r\n\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second important thing that we must do is to\r\n\r\nprofessionalise  more the jobs we create in  the  service  or\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sectors.  This will allow more people  to  work\r\n\r\nefficiently and proudly in the service sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge-based economy does not exist in a vacuum.\r\n\r\nJust  now,  we  have  heard my colleague,  Mr  Matthias  Yao,\r\n\r\nexpound  very  deeply into the meaning of  a  knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy.   I  fully agree with him.  Long before the  use  of\r\n\r\nminis  and  PCs, the Americans and the Japanese were  already\r\n\r\napplying critical knowledge systems in their manufacturing or\r\n\r\nproduction  processes.  For them, the knowledge-based  system\r\n\r\nwas  fused  with the production system.  In the manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector,  they started by being craftsmen.  Then, the machines\r\n\r\nreplaced  the  craftsmen and the large  scale  production  of\r\n\r\ngoods replaced more and more skills in the jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economists not long ago measured the comparative\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  countries  by their  skill  intensity  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction  process.   Knowledge-based  systems   were   also\r\n\r\npresent  but  not so intense.  Today, production and  service\r\n\r\nsectors require higher knowledge intensity to be competitive.\r\n\r\nIt does not mean that skills are no more important.  More and\r\n\r\nmore  sophisticated machines in production can  be  built  to\r\n\r\nreplace  specific operations and skills but it does not  mean\r\n\r\nyou  should throw the baby out with the bath water. We should\r\n\r\nupgrade the skills of our workers. Hence,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI   find  the  Manpower  Minister's  speech  yesterday   very\r\n\r\nappropriate with his elaboration on the programmes  that  are\r\n\r\navailable now to enable workers to upgrade their skills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, it has been found that the service\r\n\r\nsector  is  the one that gave the most employment during  the\r\n\r\nperiod when the IT sector and productivity growth was highest\r\n\r\nin  the last few years.  For many workers who are not  so  IT\r\n\r\nsavvy,  there  is  still hope in the KBE.  Even  in  the  new\r\n\r\neconomy,  people  need to eat, drink and  travel.  They  need\r\n\r\ngoods to be delivered, served and to be entertained. We  need\r\n\r\nto  raise  the level of skills in our workers, especially  in\r\n\r\ncertain  sectors  -  construction is  one  of  them;  retail,\r\n\r\ncleaning  and the general service sectors.  Professionalising\r\n\r\nthese  jobs will give better efficiency, justify more  value-added and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot expect every Singaporean to be able to say he\r\n\r\nworks  in  a  knowledge  economy.  But  we  can  ensure  that\r\n\r\nproduction processes be fused with a significant component of\r\n\r\nthe  knowledge-based system so that our competitive  edge  is\r\n\r\nsharpened  and  maintained, and our people at the  downstream\r\n\r\nservices continue to stay employed, and earn a decent living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once asked a well-known American economist who\r\n\r\npioneered  the  study  on the knowledge economy,  Prof.  Paul\r\n\r\nRomer,  whether  there  is a typical sectoral  profile  in  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  In other words, whether there is  a\r\n\r\nspecial pattern in the sectoral distribution of the GDP in  a\r\n\r\nknowledge-based economy.  He said quite correctly that  there\r\n\r\nwas none.  You do not even need to be IT savvy.  Knowledge of\r\n\r\nIT is only the enabler.  The business is all up to you.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel very reassured that the Government is\r\n\r\nstill very much focused on making our manufacturing sector  a\r\n\r\ndriving  sector, maintaining at 25% share of GDP, to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe hollowing out of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomy.  This is important for the manufacturing sector will\r\n\r\nprovide the base and the linkage for jobs and exports.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singaporean workers should be assured, because of\r\n\r\nthe  changes  we are going to introduce to our  training  and\r\n\r\nwork certification process. I ask all workers not to miss out\r\n\r\non  the many avenues and opportunities for training that  the\r\n\r\nNTUC has established jointly with the Government.  I wish  to\r\n\r\nremind  all my Singaporean workers that it was the  NTUC  who\r\n\r\nsounded  the bell early last year on the impending issues  of\r\n\r\nemployability and retraining for our workers and came up with\r\n\r\nthe  positive solutions.  Over the last one and a half years,\r\n\r\nmuch  has  been  achieved  by  the  NTUC  together  with  the\r\n\r\ntripartite  partners.  Today, there is a Skills Redevelopment\r\n\r\nProgramme workers can tap on.  Our workers ought to be  proud\r\n\r\nthat  there is a labour movement, led by leaders who can  see\r\n\r\nfurther than many, the storms on the horizon and prepare  the\r\n\r\nground with the solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gerard Ee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gerard Ee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou  for  giving me this opportunity to speak on  the  motion\r\n\r\nstanding in the name of Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many speakers have extolled the merits of the vision\r\n\r\nsketched  by  the President and some reservations  have  been\r\n\r\nexpressed.  I share in the excitement over the vision  as  it\r\n\r\npromises  much to look forward to. I see it as  an  extensive\r\n\r\nhome improvement programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address is but a sketch of what\r\n\r\nSingapore  can  be - a progressive nation with  its  citizens\r\n\r\nplaying  an  active  role  in  his  journey  into  the   next\r\n\r\nmillennium.   The devil is in the details, the  parts  to  be\r\n\r\npainted  in - the choice of colours and shades.  Not everyone\r\n\r\nwill  have  the  same  view of the  completed  picture.   Not\r\n\r\neveryone will see the sketch the way it is nor will they have\r\n\r\nthe same interpretation of the picture being painted.  Whilst\r\n\r\nit will be impossible to cater to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neveryone's  expectations, there must be an  understanding  of\r\n\r\nwhat they are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadly speaking, there are three milieus in any\r\n\r\nsociety  -  conveniently termed as lower,  middle  and  upper\r\n\r\nincome  groups.   Each milieu will see things differently  as\r\n\r\ntheir  priorities in life are different.  A  \"need\"  for  one\r\n\r\ngroup  may  be  inconsequential for another group.  Some  can\r\n\r\nafford  to  spend a weekend at golf whilst others must  scrap\r\n\r\nfor a better living, sometimes a matter of survival for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago, as one of the pioneer counsellors for\r\n\r\nex-drug addicts, a counselee said to me, \"It is easy for you.\r\n\r\nWith your educational qualification, you do not have to worry\r\n\r\nabout  getting  a  decent job. My future  is  different  from\r\n\r\nyours.  So how can you truly understand what I feel.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people feel that there are no longer any truly poor\r\n\r\nin Singapore.  Yet, if they are more alert, they may spot the\r\n\r\nelderly  hunched  lady  dragging home her  precious  cart  of\r\n\r\ncardboard materials at the bewitching hour whilst most people\r\n\r\nare in sweet slumber.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst everyone will accept the importance of\r\n\r\neducation  and  the need to invest time and effort  into  it,\r\n\r\nsome  children have to cope with helping out at the  family's\r\n\r\nbusiness  and  some may even have to adopt the parental  role\r\n\r\nand  be  both mum and dad to their siblings.  These  children\r\n\r\nare handicapped in their educational pursuit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether one is cosmopolitan, a heartlander, or a bit of\r\n\r\neach,  one's  view  of  things  and  expectations  will    be\r\n\r\nsignificantly influenced by the milieu that he or she belongs\r\n\r\nto.   In the call to work together and to commit not just  to\r\n\r\nSingapore, but also to one another, there must be recognition\r\n\r\nthat  there are different milieus in our society.  There  has\r\n\r\nfirst  to  be an awareness of this divide and there  must  be\r\n\r\ngenuine  empathy  for  each other's fears,  difficulties  and\r\n\r\naspirations.  The concerns of the milieus cut across races  - it  is  the  same  for  each  milieu,  whatever  their  race.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, it is the desire to be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsensitive that we do not want to recognise this divide.   But\r\n\r\nin so doing, we become less sensitive to each other's needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There cannot be social cohesion if any one milieu feels,\r\n\r\nrightly or wrongly, that it is being treated unfairly. It  is\r\n\r\nonly  by conscious effort that such misunderstandings can  be\r\n\r\nminimised.  There is a need to find ways to explain  policies\r\n\r\nin the language and in the context of each milieu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much attention was paid to involve a cross section of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans in the development of the S21 vision.   However,\r\n\r\nat  the  end of the day, the intelligentsia are the ones  who\r\n\r\npackaged and presented it to the people.  The challenge is to\r\n\r\nhelp  people of all milieus see that S21 is for them and that\r\n\r\nthey  all  have  a  role to play.  The people  who  keep  our\r\n\r\nenvironment  clean  and healthy must see that  they  too  are\r\n\r\ncontributing to the well-being of our nation and are just  as\r\n\r\nimportant  as  those generating exports.   It  is  only  when\r\n\r\neveryone  at every stratum can feel that they are playing  an\r\n\r\nimportant role in the progress of our nation that the  spirit\r\n\r\nof S21 can take root, be nourished and grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social cohesion must be the foundation, the canvas upon\r\n\r\nwhich  we sketch and paint our vision for tomorrow.   Without\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion,  we have little chance  of  completing  the\r\n\r\npicture  of  Singapore in the new millennium.  The  sketching\r\n\r\npresented will end up as just blotches of paint with clashing\r\n\r\ncolours and shades, to be passed on as 21st century art.   It\r\n\r\nmay belong to everyone but only a few will appreciate it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise  to  support the motion standing in the  name  of  Mr\r\n\r\nDavinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address promised that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  be  promoting active  citizenship  \"to  get\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to play a full part in shaping our future.\"   Mr\r\n\r\nSingh has waxed lyrical about active citizenship and I cannot\r\n\r\nmatch his eloquence and wisdom on the subject.  I wish merely\r\n\r\nto add two points to help us\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunderstand the full import of these two simple words.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, active citizens must have realistic and informed\r\n\r\nexpectations  and  opinions.  Second,  active  citizens  must\r\n\r\nlearn to disagree without being divisive.  Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Singh pointed out in his speech, we have a new\r\n\r\ngeneration of Singaporeans who expect to be consulted and  to\r\n\r\nhave their voices heard.  The Government has promised to hear\r\n\r\nthem.   At  the same time, as Mr Singh has noted,  those  who\r\n\r\npropose alternatives must be prepared to defend them  in  the\r\n\r\nrobust arena of debate.  I would add that the debate,  to  be\r\n\r\nmeaningful,  must  also be well-informed and  have  realistic\r\n\r\nexpectations.   Otherwise, the debate will  end  up  with  no\r\n\r\ngreater  merit than the bar brawl over a drunkard's  view  of\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, those who argue for more financial welfare\r\n\r\nfor the poor, along the lines of western social systems, lose\r\n\r\ntheir  credibility if they do not know why the very societies\r\n\r\nwhich have these systems are trying to ditch them.  As Mr Lim\r\n\r\nBoon  Heng  pointed out on Monday, welfare and  minimum  wage\r\n\r\nlevels  in these countries are predicated upon providing  the\r\n\r\npoor  with shelter and basic needs, with the bulk of the  aid\r\n\r\ngoing  to  the  cost of shelter.  In Singapore,  90%  of  our\r\n\r\npeople already own their own homes.  Demanding the same level\r\n\r\nor  model of welfare would be uninformed, unrealistic, unwise\r\n\r\nand an altogether unfair debating point.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As another example, journalist Chua Lee Hoong has\r\n\r\nexpressed her dismay that MPs in this House are not following\r\n\r\nup   on  each  other's  points,  affirming,  elaborating   or\r\n\r\ncountering.  She  totally misunderstands  the  purpose  of  a\r\n\r\nParliamentary debate to thank the President for his  Address.\r\n\r\nProcedurally, the debate is on Mr Singh's motion, whether  or\r\n\r\nnot  to  thank the President.  It is a device for Members  to\r\n\r\nexplore the issues raised by the President's Address and  the\r\n\r\nAddenda.  If we were to debate Mr Singh's points\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalone,  this would be a very narrow debate indeed!   She  has\r\n\r\nprobably  also not informed herself of how debate is  carried\r\n\r\nout  in other Parliaments.  Her criticism is thus unfair,  as\r\n\r\nunfair  as  her  comment that His Excellency the  President's\r\n\r\nAddress is devoid of wit and passion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the President's Address is a ceremonial speech\r\n\r\noutlining   the  Government's  programme.   It   is   not   a\r\n\r\npolitician's  speech. The passion within it  is  understated.\r\n\r\nSurely, she does not expect him to punctuate his Speech  with\r\n\r\nshouts of \"Merdeka\"?  Has she never seen the Queen of England\r\n\r\ndeliver   similar   speeches   in   stately   fashion?    The\r\n\r\nConstitutional   convention  allows  for  passion   only   in\r\n\r\npoliticians' speeches!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, Miss Chua certainly has not seen Parliamentarians\r\n\r\ndebating  in  the  Lok  Sabha  in  India.   There,  as  here,\r\n\r\nParliamentary  time  is  short, the  opportunities  to  speak\r\n\r\nlimited  and  the  agenda  long.   Parliamentarians  need  to\r\n\r\nespouse  the views of their constituents; they have  to  push\r\n\r\nthe  interests  and promote programmes for the well-being  of\r\n\r\nthose  they represent.  So, in the Lok Sabha, it is a  common\r\n\r\nsight  to  see  several MPs all talking at the top  of  their\r\n\r\nvoices  at  the same time.  Would they be listening  to  each\r\n\r\nother, I wonder?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, you have the fine example of\r\n\r\nCongressmen  in the US House of Representatives.   I  visited\r\n\r\nthat  august  institution  in 1985  when  the  House  was  in\r\n\r\nsession.  In a chamber that sits 435 people, I saw a  handful\r\n\r\nseated and one standing and speaking.  At first, I thought he\r\n\r\nwas  rehearsing  his speech, until I saw the Speaker  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse  move  to  make  a  ruling on  something.   In  the  US\r\n\r\nCongress,  the  more important work is done in  its  hallowed\r\n\r\nhalls  -  and  thus the word \"lobby\"  -  not in the  debating\r\n\r\nchamber.   Not many Congressmen were listening to his  debate\r\n\r\nto counter it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House, Sir, I am glad to say, is more orderly than\r\n\r\nthe  Lok  Sabha  and  more diligent  than  the  US  House  of\r\n\r\nRepresentatives.  We have many points to push, many petitions\r\n\r\nto  plead, and some pet projects to promote.  We do not do it\r\n\r\nfor show, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  air  the views of our citizens.  To paraphrase the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister who said this before in this House, if what  Members\r\n\r\nsay  in  here do not resonate outside, we are done for.   The\r\n\r\ndebate on the President's Address is not a school debate with\r\n\r\nthrust  and  counter thrust.  In the past,  many  ideas  were\r\n\r\nfloated in these debates, some of which were later picked  up\r\n\r\nby  the  Front  Bench and incorporated into the  Government's\r\n\r\nprogrammes.  We do not wish it any other way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point on active citizens is that we must learn\r\n\r\nto  disagree without coming to blows.  Robust debate  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily a personal attack.  Passion must not be  mistaken\r\n\r\nfor  aggression.  As Mr Singh asked, \"Can we take the  heat?\"\r\n\r\nIf we cannot, we should not stay in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a student in America, and again in England, I\r\n\r\noften saw my friends argue with each other (and even with the\r\n\r\nProfessors) until their faces were blue.  And yet, they never\r\n\r\nbecame  enemies.   Here,  in  our  culture,  the  moment  you\r\n\r\ncontradict  someone  just a little too vigorously,  you  have\r\n\r\nlost  a  friend.  For active citizens to benefit from  active\r\n\r\ndebates,  we  must  learn to take as well  as  we  give,  and\r\n\r\nadjourn for a happy drink together afterwards.  \"Defeat\"  can\r\n\r\nbe  accepted  with  grace,  not  a  feeling  of  humiliation.\r\n\r\nDisagreement does not mean division.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have learnt that we can agree to disagree, it\r\n\r\nwould  not  make  headlines anymore  every  time  a  Minister\r\n\r\nappears  to  disagree with another, or a Member of Parliament\r\n\r\ndoes  not align himself with a Government position.  It  does\r\n\r\nnot mean that the PAP has begun to split, nor that the Member\r\n\r\nin  question is embittered and is \"hitting out\".  Such is the\r\n\r\ngrist of active gossip, not citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we have occasion to disagree with the Government,\r\n\r\nwe  must have the conviction that we are right and are  ready\r\n\r\nto  defend  our stand.  That is why we must be well-informed.\r\n\r\nIf  we  hit hard, we must expect to be hit hard.  As Mr Singh\r\n\r\nsaid, in moving this motion, this Government is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  known for the subtlety of its replies.  Perhaps as  time\r\n\r\ngoes  by,  all of us will learn how to modulate our blows  in\r\n\r\ndebate,  though the calibration is an art to be  learnt  from\r\n\r\nexperience,  not a science that is acquired from  the  books.\r\n\r\nWhile we call on the Government to be more thick-skinned when\r\n\r\ncriticised, we must not apply double standards.   The  active\r\n\r\ncitizen  must  learn to be thick-skinned too!  Ask  Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay,  or perhaps Prof. Walter Woon.  No active citizen should\r\n\r\nthrow  in the towel and proclaim that he has stopped  because\r\n\r\nhe  is now cowering in fear.  If he fears his own shadow, the\r\n\r\npublic  forum  and its floodlights is not a  place  where  he\r\n\r\nshould be found.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address offered another set of\r\n\r\nbuzzwords:   Singapore as a \"knowledge-based economy\".   Sir,\r\n\r\npermit me next to say a few words on this topic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge is acquired, usually from education. This is\r\n\r\nprobably   why  many  Members  before  me  have  majored   on\r\n\r\neducational reform.  Our educational system has traditionally\r\n\r\nbeen  knowledge-intensive, pressed down  by  dedicated  drill\r\n\r\nmasters.   In the Information Age, however, knowledge  has  a\r\n\r\nvery  short shelf life.  What you learn in school may  become\r\n\r\nobsolete  a short six years after you graduate.   It  is  not\r\n\r\nproductive  in  such   a  world to  cram  our  children  with\r\n\r\nknowledge.   We  must equip them with skill sets  which  will\r\n\r\nhelp  them  acquire useful knowledge all through their  lives\r\n\r\nand sound values for them to discern between good and evil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education in such a world should not be examination-interrupted as it is currently. There are important\r\n\r\nexaminations  at the end of Primary 3, 4, 6; Secondary  2,  4\r\n\r\nand  Junior  College.  If we set aside two months to  prepare\r\n\r\nfor  each  examination, we would have wasted a full one  year\r\n\r\ndoing  nothing but cram.  We would have lost productivity  in\r\n\r\nthe economy too, because parents have to take leave from work\r\n\r\nto  rehearse  the  children for their examinations.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nschool in the future will not be examination-interrupted  but\r\n\r\nexamination-terminated.  One graduation examination, the  'A'\r\n\r\nlevels.  I am thrilled therefore that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Education is taking a step in that direction\r\n\r\nby considering dropping the 'O' level  for some students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want \"thinking schools\". For that not to be an empty\r\n\r\nslogan,  we  must allow students time to think;  time  to  be\r\n\r\ncreative;  time to sieve good from bad, gold from dross.   On\r\n\r\nthe   Internet,   there   are  lots   of   information,   and\r\n\r\nmisinformation.  Our children must learn how  to  choose  and\r\n\r\ndiscern  what is harmful and what is not.  If school is  full\r\n\r\nof  examinations and cramming, how would they  find  time  to\r\n\r\nthink?   Ian Buruma condemns us as a nation afraid to  think.\r\n\r\nActually,  our problem is that we have no time to think.   To\r\n\r\nmy knowledge, only a certain Member without a constituency is\r\n\r\nafraid  to  think, as I noticed that he plagiarised  a  whole\r\n\r\nchunk  of  Buruma's  article and passed it  off  as  his  own\r\n\r\nanalysis of Singapore in his speech during this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children are so busy that they have no time to be\r\n\r\nchildren,  no time to play.  I agree wholeheartedly  with  Mr\r\n\r\nPeh  Chin Hua that we should stop driving them from class  to\r\n\r\nclass, tuition to tuition, enrichment programme to enrichment\r\n\r\nprogramme.  To everything, there is a season  -  a season for\r\n\r\nstudy,  a season for play; a season for stress, a season  for\r\n\r\nde-stress.  Play is productive, even creative.  Why are we so\r\n\r\nafraid  to  let our children play?  So afraid that  we  teach\r\n\r\nthem Primary One things in kindergarten!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so glad that the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nEducation has declared that henceforth this will stop.  I  do\r\n\r\nhope that the Ministry will next stop the hideous practice of\r\n\r\nranking schools purely on academic performance.  Rank if  you\r\n\r\nmust,  but do not forget to give high scores to schools which\r\n\r\ngive  their students a balanced education, rounding  them  up\r\n\r\nwith sports, arts and character-building programmes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has clearly stated that school\r\n\r\ncurricula  will be revised to cater for these.  I  am  deeply\r\n\r\nappreciative, as many Singaporean parents would be, with that\r\n\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the one year that we save in not having\r\n\r\nexaminations,  we  should send our children  for  sports  and\r\n\r\nmusic  camps  perhaps, or SIF overseas volunteer  programmes,\r\n\r\nstudent  exchange  programmes,  Operation  Raleigh  projects,\r\n\r\nOutward  Bound School.  We should challenge them to climb  Mt\r\n\r\nEverest,  Mt Kinabalu or at least Mt Ophir.  Presently,  they\r\n\r\ndo  not  even  have time to climb Mt Faber!  We cannot  allow\r\n\r\nthis to continue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, we must not forget that we have\r\n\r\ntaught them to pledge, \"to build a democratic society,  based\r\n\r\non   justice  and  equality,  so  as  to  achieve  happiness,\r\n\r\nprosperity  and progress for our nation.\"  They cannot  learn\r\n\r\nabout   a   democratic   society  by  suffering   six   major\r\n\r\nexaminations in 12 years of schooling.  They must leave their\r\n\r\nbooks   and   visit   Parliament,  the  courts,   the   civil\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  They cannot learn about justice  and  equality\r\n\r\nfrom  textbooks  and endless assessment  papers.   They  must\r\n\r\nexperience  these  from  interaction with  their  classmates,\r\n\r\nmulti-racial classmates at that, and with their community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me say that hitherto, the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in all its policies has over-emphasised,  dare  I\r\n\r\nsay,  \"achieving  prosperity  and  progress\"  and  left   out\r\n\r\n\"happiness\"  for the most part.  The Chinese version  of  our\r\n\r\npledge refers to \"happiness\" as xin fu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) which,\r\n\r\nloosely translated, can mean \"blessing\".  Blessing is a state\r\n\r\nof contentment, much deeper than happiness, and it comes from\r\n\r\nspiritual  and  emotional well-being.  Even happiness  itself\r\n\r\ncannot  come  simply from material prosperity  and  progress.\r\n\r\nHappiness  comes from fond memories of Singapore,  our  home.\r\n\r\nOur  hearts must beat, as the President said in his  Address,\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore - for its foods and smells, for its sounds and\r\n\r\ncolours, its history, its landmarks and its people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn to restrain our urge to demolish every\r\n\r\nbuilding  we see that does not fit into our plans.   We  must\r\n\r\nstop  removing  the landmarks of our history.   Architectural\r\n\r\nmerit must not be the only consideration for preservation.  I\r\n\r\nregret, for example, the demolition of my alma mater\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago in the past, the first school  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith  a  very,  very  large  history,  because  it  was   not\r\n\r\neconomical or distinctive enough architecturally to save.  Is\r\n\r\nthe  National Library building at Stamford Road   really  not\r\n\r\npossible to save and refurbish for future generations to mark\r\n\r\nour history?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Happiness too, Sir, comes from making life more\r\n\r\nmeaningful  for others, especially those less fortunate  than\r\n\r\nourselves.  That is active citizenship.  Happiness too  comes\r\n\r\nfrom having fun.  We say that every Singaporean counts.   His\r\n\r\nwelfare  counts.   For him, we need to make Singapore  a  fun\r\n\r\nplace  to  live in, not just because it helps us  to  make  a\r\n\r\nquick  tourist dollar, but because it is what we have pledged\r\n\r\nto  do.  I am glad that finally in MITA's programmes, we have\r\n\r\na  plan  to promote fun in Singapore.  As many of our Western\r\n\r\nfriends might say, \"Come on Singapore, loosen up!\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am grateful to join in this\r\n\r\ndebate.   I  wish  to speak on this Government's  promise  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  people and to promote active citizenship.   In  so\r\n\r\ndoing,  there are three fundamental questions we need to  ask\r\n\r\nourselves: (1) Why is this important?  (2)  What specifically\r\n\r\nshould  and  will be done, and by whom?  (3)  What  obstacles\r\n\r\nand limits stand in our way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to begin with an observation not about\r\n\r\nSingapore  but  about Vietnam, where I have been  and  why  I\r\n\r\nmissed  the first two days of this debate.  We are not  alone\r\n\r\nin  facing  change  and the new millennium for  our  society.\r\n\r\nVietnam  is  in something of a dilemma.  They recognise  that\r\n\r\nthey need to open up their country to the world market and to\r\n\r\nforeign  investors.  This is their doi moi policy.   However,\r\n\r\nthey  are concerned about foreign influence on their  society\r\n\r\nand how society and politics will change as they open up.  So\r\n\r\nthey seem to muddle through.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very astute observer remarked to me, \"the problem is\r\n\r\nthat  they  won the war.\"  The problem is that they  won  the\r\n\r\nwar.  This statement is not to wish that they lost.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthis statement acutely sees the problem of success.  When you\r\n\r\nhave  won  the  war,  you believe you have  the  formula  for\r\n\r\nsuccess.  You have the veterans you must take care of, and  a\r\n\r\nsystem  that brought victory.  It is therefore very  hard  to\r\n\r\nchange,  to say, \"we need something new\".  Instead, there  is\r\n\r\nsome tinkering, some muddling around, half measures.  In this\r\n\r\nsense,  past  success inhibits real and necessary  change  to\r\n\r\nmeet the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, where people lose, there is justification\r\n\r\nand  occasion  for  widespread change.  Something  like  what\r\n\r\nJapan experienced after World War II, just as before, in  the\r\n\r\nMeiji  restoration.  A crisis and a failure bring  a  country\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity for a deep change, a transformation.   Japan\r\n\r\nis,  by  the way, now looking at a commission, much like  the\r\n\r\nSingapore 21, on Japan's role in the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, of course, is very different from Vietnam or\r\n\r\nJapan.   We  did not fight the kind of war (although  in  the\r\n\r\n1970s,  the  conventional wisdom said that we  might  if  the\r\n\r\ndominoes  in  Southeast Asia fell).  But we did  win  through\r\n\r\nanother struggle for economic success and survival.   We  too\r\n\r\nhad succeeded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In achieving this success, this victory, we have our own\r\n\r\nveterans  and our own system of society and politics.   These\r\n\r\nhave served us well in the past and in the present, and it is\r\n\r\nvery  difficult to abandon them abruptly.  Indeed, there  are\r\n\r\nthose  among  us who also fear that if we open up  too  fast,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not sure what influences will work on our society,\r\n\r\nand change our politics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we then too successful to truly change? Will we\r\n\r\njust simply tinker around and hope to muddle through the 21st\r\n\r\ncentury?   Or can we truly commit ourselves to necessary  and\r\n\r\nreal change for an active people sector?  Much depends on our\r\n\r\nmotivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Why do we need active citizens?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my first point. Why do we need this\r\n\r\nchange?   Why  do we need active citizens?  Why  do  we  need\r\n\r\npeople to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nactively   participate   in  the   nation's   affairs?    The\r\n\r\nPresidential Address gives us two main reasons for this goal.\r\n\r\nFirst,  active  citizens  can  improve  Government  policies.\r\n\r\nSecond,  active citizenship and participation gives people  a\r\n\r\nstake  in  the  country.  The second of these two  reasons  - giving all a stake - ties with the overall goal of developing\r\n\r\nstronger  social cohesion to make sure we gel together  as  a\r\n\r\npeople.   This  is important as we prepare for  a  knowledge-based  economy  because such an economy will tend  to  reward\r\n\r\npeople very differently and can potentially divide us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call for active citizenship in this sense has a very\r\n\r\nrational economic basis.  First, and most immediately, we can\r\n\r\nimprove  on  policies.  Second, and more broadly, \"heartware\"\r\n\r\nis  to  be  the  social bond for a vast  and  rapid  economic\r\n\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these rational and economic reasons enough to\r\n\r\nmotivate real and necessary change?  Some Singaporeans  will,\r\n\r\nof course, always queue up if there is a sale.  If there is a\r\n\r\ndollar  sign,  they will queue up.  For some people,  it  is.\r\n\r\nBut not for all of us, and not always.  Some of us respond to\r\n\r\nother stimulus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these is the goal of becoming a \"democracy\".\r\n\r\nWhen I use this word, I do not want to embroil this House  in\r\n\r\na  debate about definitions. Democracy is a loaded term.   It\r\n\r\nis often used to mean a certain form of liberal democracy, as\r\n\r\nwe  see in some Western societies.  But here, I use the  word\r\n\r\n\"democracy\",  in the terms of our own pledge.  We  pledge  to\r\n\r\nbuild  a \"democratic society, based on justice and equality\".\r\n\r\nIf  we hold true to this goal, this ideal of democracy,  this\r\n\r\ncan be a third and potent reason to have active citizens.  In\r\n\r\na  democracy,  more than any other society or system,  people\r\n\r\ncount.   Literally  they vote, and their vote  counts.   More\r\n\r\nthan  that,  they  participate in  the  society  and  in  the\r\n\r\npolitical processes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I do not see that active citizens are an\r\n\r\noption, a luxury for good\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntimes.  They are essential to face the coming challenges  for\r\n\r\nSingapore to be a home amidst the open, competitive,  rapidly\r\n\r\nchanging and often turbulent world that is coming.  We should\r\n\r\nnot  wish for a crisis or to lose a war in order to have real\r\n\r\nchange.   But we have to be motivated for real change.   Only\r\n\r\nthen  can  the  goals  set  by the  Presidential  Address  be\r\n\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I must confess that I am disappointed on\r\n\r\nthis  point of active citizens by the plans announced by  the\r\n\r\ndifferent  Ministries in their Addenda  to  the  Presidential\r\n\r\nAddress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>What specifically should and will be done, and by whom?</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with this in the second question: What\r\n\r\nspecifically should and will be done, and by whom?  If we  go\r\n\r\nthrough  the Addenda of the different Ministries,  there  are\r\n\r\nrelatively few references to plans to make active citizenship\r\n\r\npossible.    Perhaps  they  have  their  own  more  immediate\r\n\r\nconcerns  with existing policies and plans.  There is,  after\r\n\r\nall,  no  Ministry in overall charge of this  initiative  for\r\n\r\nactive citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Ministries do mention plans for active\r\n\r\ncitizens, these plans do not seem to me to go very far beyond\r\n\r\nwhat  we  already have.  Take, for example, the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCommunity  Development's plans for the Feedback  Unit.   This\r\n\r\nUnit is very important for active citizens to be heard and to\r\n\r\nalso listen.  But if you look at paragraph 9 of the Addendum,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The Feedback Unit will reach out to more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  obtain varied and representative feedback.  It will  also\r\n\r\ninform  and explain to opinion makers and grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nthe rationale and details of Government policies.\"\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is this different from what they have done before\r\n\r\nand what they are doing now?  Why is the emphasis still on  a\r\n\r\ndownward  communication  to  opinion  makers  and  grassroots\r\n\r\nleaders to explain to them why policies are as they are?   If\r\n\r\nthere   is   no  difference,  and  an  emphasis  on  downward\r\n\r\ncommunication, how will this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstatus  quo  promote  the change towards  an  active  citizen\r\n\r\nsector?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plans by the Ministry of Information and the Arts\r\n\r\nare  similar  in this regard.  It talks about the  access  to\r\n\r\ninformation and again this is obviously very important to  an\r\n\r\nactive people sector.  But there seems in their Addenda to be\r\n\r\nmore   concern  that  the  greater  and  easier   access   to\r\n\r\ninformation  will impinge on economic, social  and  political\r\n\r\nlife.  While this is true and should be studied, I would have\r\n\r\nhoped that there would be an equal study on enabling citizens\r\n\r\nto  have  use  of greater access to become more knowledgeable\r\n\r\nand  aware of important issues facing our society.  This will\r\n\r\nbe  the  necessary basis, the foundation, for more  informed,\r\n\r\nreasoned and active people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn next to the Prime Minister's Office. I was\r\n\r\nheartened  here to see a subsection of the Addendum  entitled\r\n\r\n\"Towards  Active  Citizenship\", and by  the  pledge  in  this\r\n\r\nAddendum  to  have the public service play its  part  towards\r\n\r\nattaining  this  goal.  But the particulars of  the  Addendum\r\n\r\nfall short, in my view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The promise here is to \"consult the private and public\r\n\r\nsectors  more,  in  order  to  obtain  feedback,  tap   their\r\n\r\nspecialised  knowledge,  and [I  want  to  emphasise]  ensure\r\n\r\nsmoother implementation of Government's policies.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Smoother implementation of Government's policies\" is a\r\n\r\nnecessary  and  helpful step.  But it is not  enough  for  an\r\n\r\nactive  people.  Active citizens are not just there  to  help\r\n\r\nGovernment policy implementation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, it is worth pointing out that all of us\r\n\r\ncitizens  have at least three parts - hands, a  heart  and  a\r\n\r\nhead.     Government   wants   helping   hands.    Government\r\n\r\nincreasingly wants the hearts of Singaporeans too, if this is\r\n\r\nto  be our home.  But it is less clear from the various plans\r\n\r\nwhether  Government also wants the head.  Not on  a  chopping\r\n\r\nblock.   But a head, a mind that can independently think  and\r\n\r\nwant  to propose or oppose policies, rather than just helping\r\n\r\nsmoother implementation. And with that head comes mouths that\r\n\r\ncan freely and reasonably speak.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Ministries have proposed is a start, but a very\r\n\r\nmodest  one at best.  The Singapore 21 Committee on the  idea\r\n\r\nof  active  citizens went quite a bit further.   The  subject\r\n\r\ncommittee which I chaired with Mr Lim Swee  Say, now Minister\r\n\r\nof State, on \"consensus and consultation against decisiveness\r\n\r\nand  quick action\" made a number of concrete suggestions that\r\n\r\nhave  yet  to  find  a  place  in the  Addenda  announced  by\r\n\r\nGovernment.  I hope perhaps they will.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these points, I want to emphasise that I am\r\n\r\nnot arguing for free licence and a rowdy free-for-all.  Those\r\n\r\nwho  argue against a status quo can often be mischaracterised\r\n\r\nin this way, and they find their proposals labelled \"radical\"\r\n\r\nor \"unrealistic\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach I am arguing for finds its analogy in the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the financial sector.  First, we must  have\r\n\r\na   broad  vision  of  what  the  Government  wants  and   an\r\n\r\nidentification  of  present  limits.   Second,  we   need   a\r\n\r\nrecognition  that  while Government will  have  a  regulatory\r\n\r\nrole,  that  role  has changed.  Third, we need  an  emerging\r\n\r\npractice that shows all the practitioners concerned that  the\r\n\r\nphilosophy  and  tools  for regulation  have  changed.   And,\r\n\r\nfourth,  we  need  a series of measures that  will  push  and\r\n\r\nchange the existing limits.  In financial liberalisation, the\r\n\r\nGovernment's approach has been, I believe, for  a  series  of\r\n\r\n\"small   bangs\".   Not  radical,  but  readily   discernible.\r\n\r\nMeasured but measurable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would call for a similar approach to the\r\n\r\nliberalisation  of  our laws and policies towards  an  active\r\n\r\npeople sector.  And I am disappointed that I do not find such\r\n\r\na series of small bangs in the Ministerial Addenda.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while I criticise, I certainly do not want to be\r\n\r\nseen  as  an  armchair critic, or even a Parliamentary  chair\r\n\r\ncritic.   I  and  my  fellow  NMP, Zulkifli  Baharudin,  will\r\n\r\nundertake a study on civil society in 21st century Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe will roll up our sleeves as an active citizen, do our part\r\n\r\nto study this problem. The study will focus\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  three areas: (1) the registration of societies;  (2)  the\r\n\r\nlimits to speech and assembly, especially in public; and  (3)\r\n\r\nthe  role  of private foundations and Government agencies  in\r\n\r\nsupporting and fostering civil society organisations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, to us, three of the key limits and obstacles\r\n\r\nto  a  more active people sector.  Mr Zulkifli and I  do  not\r\n\r\nprejudge what the conclusions of the study will be.  In  each\r\n\r\narea, while there is a need for more openness, there may also\r\n\r\nbe valid reasons for limits and obstacles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the first area, for example. The registration of\r\n\r\nsocieties  is fundamental to having active citizens  organise\r\n\r\nthemselves.  If they do not register, they may be  considered\r\n\r\nillegal and prosecuted.  Yet, it is within the discretion  of\r\n\r\nthe Registrar of Societies to refuse their registration on  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of grounds.  So some cases take time.  In comparison,\r\n\r\nthe  registration of private companies is automatic and easy.\r\n\r\nThere  are historical reasons for this, and also some present\r\n\r\nday  concerns.  We therefore have to more closely examine how\r\n\r\nto  balance  the  needs, on the one hand, of  a  more  active\r\n\r\npeople   sector  to  organise  themselves  and  be   lawfully\r\n\r\nregistered and recognised, with, on the  other hand, the need\r\n\r\nfor caution and control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second area too of public speech, I think there\r\n\r\nis  a need to examine the balance.  It cannot be, on the  one\r\n\r\nhand,  that we allow speech without responsibility, and allow\r\n\r\nfor  sedition, racial slurs, defamation, mis-information  and\r\n\r\npossible  disorder in the streets. But, on  the  other  hand,\r\n\r\nshould we continue to have all public speech, including  that\r\n\r\non  political  and  social issues, licensed  under  a  Public\r\n\r\nEntertainment Act, and decided by some faceless  bureaucrats?\r\n\r\nIn  comparison,  our censorship of films  has,  in  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade, moved far beyond this already.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me at this juncture, mention this debate about\r\n\r\nhaving thick skin.  In my case, I think, it is more just  bad\r\n\r\nskin which people mistake for thick skin.  I want to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npoint out that, of course, people who want to participate  in\r\n\r\npublic  debate  must have thick skin.  But  I  also  want  to\r\n\r\nemphasise the question of whether, in this robust engagement,\r\n\r\nit  is truly equal and truly fair.  The analogy I have, in  a\r\n\r\nsense, is traffic.  We all drive.  You may have a car, I  may\r\n\r\nhave  a car.  Others drive in bigger cars and some of us  may\r\n\r\nbe  bus  drivers.  Buses today are big, fast,  turbo-charged.\r\n\r\nBoth cars and buses have honks.  I may sound my \"horn\", or to\r\n\r\nuse  Singlish, I may horn.  But if I am driving a car  and  I\r\n\r\nhonk, it does not mean that I will be able to engage the bus,\r\n\r\neven  if it is in the wrong.  He is probably a wiser man  who\r\n\r\nvalues his car, his life and that of his passengers who gives\r\n\r\nway   to  the  bus.   I  think  this  analogy  needs  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration when we talk about debates between a fledgling,\r\n\r\nyoung people sector with an established strong, knowledgeable\r\n\r\nand determined Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are some of the issues that we hope to consider in\r\n\r\nour  study over the next few months and to seek a new balance\r\n\r\nfor.   But,  as  I  said, I do not prejudge our  conclusions.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  can  tell you is our approach.  We will consult  and\r\n\r\ncanvass our initial thoughts with relevant actors, especially\r\n\r\nthose  in civil society and also those in relevant Government\r\n\r\nagencies.  We will aim for consensus.  But that is not always\r\n\r\npossible.  I think we should not water down our study to  the\r\n\r\nlowest  common denominator.  Therefore, we will not shy  away\r\n\r\nfrom controversy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to coach and also to criticise. We hope to\r\n\r\npersuade  and debate and also press.  Those who do  not  have\r\n\r\npower, who do not sit in the seat of power in Government, can\r\n\r\ndo no more.  But active citizens should do no less.\r\n\r\nWith this, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthank you for allowing me to join in the debate on the motion\r\n\r\nto thank the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next millennium will be a different era from this\r\n\r\ncentury.   Two  major  trends will have  a  major  impact  on\r\n\r\nSingapore in the next century.  The socio-economic\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlandscape  of  Singapore will be transformed by the  Internet\r\n\r\nand  information technology revolution and the  small  modern\r\n\r\nSingapore  family  will face the challenges  of  managing  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly aging population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis on people development, active citizenship\r\n\r\nand  development of heartware will take a different dimension\r\n\r\nwith  the  explosion  of the Internet, broadband  technology,\r\n\r\nwireless  technology  and  other  developments  in   the   IT\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The IT revolution will change the social and economic\r\n\r\nlandscape of the world.  As we prepare the younger generation\r\n\r\nin  our educational institutions for the future, we must also\r\n\r\nprepare  ourselves for the consequences of the IT  explosion,\r\n\r\nespecially the Internet.  The Internet will have far-reaching\r\n\r\nimplications for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Internet world, speed is everything, and the\r\n\r\nextremely fast pace of development has opened an entirely new\r\n\r\nsocial  and  economic virtual world that only  the  Internet-savvy  can  keep  pace  with.  Entirely new  businesses  have\r\n\r\nsprouted out that have grown rapidly to challenge established\r\n\r\ninstitutions.  Many virtual Internet companies are now  worth\r\n\r\nmore  than their competitors and are increasingly eating into\r\n\r\nthe  economic pie of the real world competitors.   Those  who\r\n\r\nhave  the vision to understand the power of the Internet  and\r\n\r\nharness  its  power  will be leaders  in  the  next  economic\r\n\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the mid-70s when this American Charles Schwab decided\r\n\r\nto  transform  his  full-service brokerage  into  a  discount\r\n\r\nbrokerage firm, he insisted, against a trend, that  he  would\r\n\r\ndevelop in-house technology.  He placed his bet on technology\r\n\r\nand signed a cheque that was equal to the entire net worth of\r\n\r\nhis company.  By 1996 it had begun offering Web training.  In\r\n\r\nJanuary 1998, it weaved all its electronic services into  one\r\n\r\nintegrated  service.  Now, according to the IT research  firm\r\n\r\ncompany, IDC, Charles Schwab & Company commands more than 70%\r\n\r\nof the assets traded online, and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nits  trading  volume is that of its nearest three competitors\r\n\r\ncombined.  Worth US$36.5 billion, Charles Schwab & Company is\r\n\r\nwidely acknowledged as the only traditional retail operation,\r\n\r\nfinancial services or otherwise, to have successfully adapted\r\n\r\nits  business  to the Web.  Charles Schwab has become  bigger\r\n\r\nthan established financial institutions, like Merryl Lynch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success story is not only confined to USA. Despite\r\n\r\na  non-supportive environment in Japan, Mr Mikitani,  a  1988\r\n\r\ngraduate  in Japan, launched his Internet site in  1997,  and\r\n\r\nsince  then  he has developed Rakuten into the  most  popular\r\n\r\nonline  business-to-consumer e-commerce designation in Japan,\r\n\r\naveraging approximately US$3.5 million in transactions  every\r\n\r\nmonth  and  more than 400,000 visits per day.  He  said,  \"In\r\n\r\nJapan,  everyone  was  pessimistic about  e-commerce,  and  I\r\n\r\nwanted  to do something that everyone was pessimistic about.\"\r\n\r\nTwo-and-a-half  years  later,  Rakuten  has  become   Japan's\r\n\r\nlargest on-line shopping mall, providing auction, hosting and\r\n\r\ntransaction-processing services and market-analysis tools  to\r\n\r\nmore than 750 of Japan's largest companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet will affect every industry. Interactive\r\n\r\nvideo  on  demand,  music on the Internet and  the  broadband\r\n\r\nrevolution  are  shaking up the entertainment  industry.   No\r\n\r\nbusiness will be spared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singapore to be relevant in the next century, we\r\n\r\nmust  become a top class Internet and technological hub.   We\r\n\r\nmust have the right ingredients to succeed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential ingredient we have to add to ignite any\r\n\r\nsignificant  revolutionary  development  in  the  information\r\n\r\ntechnology industry is the entrepreneur or technopreneur.   A\r\n\r\nrare  species,  they  are  imbued with  clear  vision,  great\r\n\r\nforesight, utmost determination, inexhaustible drive, extreme\r\n\r\npassion, immense resourcefulness and perhaps a foolhardy love\r\n\r\nfor  risk.   The spirit of the entrepreneurs exudes boundless\r\n\r\nand  infective optimism that drives the belief that they  can\r\n\r\nachieve the most wonderful things in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  face of gargantuan obstacles.  For any market or economy\r\n\r\nto  prosper, entrepreneuers are indispensable.  They are  the\r\n\r\nagents of change.  As the economist Lester Thurow observes in\r\n\r\nhis   latest   book,   Building  Wealth,   \"Change   requires\r\n\r\nindividuals who recognize that new things can be done and who\r\n\r\ntake  the  initiative  to get them  done.   .   The  existing\r\n\r\nbureaucracies, public and private, will not take on  the  job\r\n\r\nof changing what is.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bureaucracies will have to constantly modify the\r\n\r\nrules to create a conducive environment that will ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  entrepreneur will thrive.  We have taken  some  concrete\r\n\r\nmeasures  but  more needs to be done.  I have  been  told  by\r\n\r\ncompanies  that have taken grants from NSTB that they  lament\r\n\r\nabout  the  bureaucracy.  Perhaps it is time  to  review  the\r\n\r\nadministration of such grants to IT companies to establish  a\r\n\r\ncomfortable balance between protecting the interest  of  NSTB\r\n\r\nand the non-hindrance of company efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindsets have to be changed. The Internet will make the\r\n\r\nworld  a giant information hub.  Information cannot be hidden\r\n\r\nas Internet allows us to harness the wealth of information on\r\n\r\nthe  Net.  For example, health and medical information  sites\r\n\r\nin  the USA provide equal access to all users, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  he  is  a medical doctor or a lay person.   However,\r\n\r\nmany  Singapore  sites tend to bar the lay  public  from  the\r\n\r\nrestricted  areas which are only accessible to professionals.\r\n\r\nThe  irony of it is that the same information, or even better\r\n\r\ninformation,  is available on the US sites and accessible  to\r\n\r\nthe  lay public.  Singaporeans must learn to understand  that\r\n\r\nthe  Internet world is a borderless world.  Instead of hiding\r\n\r\ninformation, we can play an important role in optimising  the\r\n\r\nuse   of  information  available.   We  can  help  Net  users\r\n\r\ndistinguish  the  good  sites from those  with  poor  quality\r\n\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Singapore Government wants to fulfill its dream\r\n\r\nof  becoming a world-class virtual hub, Government Ministries\r\n\r\nand bodies must be bold enough to make the\r\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges that can help technopreneurs and entrepreneurs  blaze\r\n\r\ntheir  way  into the realm of the Internet and stand  on  the\r\n\r\npedestal of success.  In this case, it is not a case of  more\r\n\r\nspeed, less haste; but rather more speed is the best pace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the key elements of entrepreneurship and the\r\n\r\ncreation of the right milieu for Singapore to succeed in  the\r\n\r\nnew  era,  we  need  to  add  the element  of  a  trained  IT\r\n\r\nworkforce.   A  strong focus on IT in the educational  system\r\n\r\nwill  prepare a new generation for the IT era.   However,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not forget that there is also a significant segment  of\r\n\r\nthe  population that is not Internet-savvy.  I am  glad  that\r\n\r\nthe  PA  (People's Association), has stated that it wants  to\r\n\r\nchange its image.  The Community Clubs have the potential  to\r\n\r\nbecome  a natural foci to start this Internet revolution  for\r\n\r\nthe  uninitiated, as it is visited by a wide spectrum of  our\r\n\r\nsociety, be it men or women, young or old.  The virtual world\r\n\r\nis  also  where the Singapore Government needs to engage  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.   If  we do not do so, we will have an increasingly\r\n\r\nlarger  segment  of Singaporeans spending more  time  in  the\r\n\r\nvirtual  world oblivious to the realities of the  real  world\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  virtual world will be  a  place  where  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government will find it more difficult to reach out\r\n\r\nto the virtual citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, Government Ministries must take the lead in\r\n\r\nengaging Singaporeans in this virtual world and move  towards\r\n\r\nhaving  websites  that  are  not  merely  static  information\r\n\r\nportals  but truly interactive portals.  I must commend  HDB,\r\n\r\nfor  example, which has an extremely comprehensive site,  and\r\n\r\nit  would be made complete if it was truly interactive and in\r\n\r\nmore than one language.  There is a very impressive list of e-mails  which you can actually send to the different  branches\r\n\r\nand  even to the headquarters.  But feedback from people  who\r\n\r\nhave  seen me is that often you do not get much of  a  reply.\r\n\r\nSo I think if we want it to be a truly active and interactive\r\n\r\nsite and promote active citizenship, this is one step that we\r\n\r\nhave to take.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet revolution has provided Singapore with an\r\n\r\nopportunity to become a top service and financial hub  centre\r\n\r\nin  the world.  It will create an e-commerce entity that will\r\n\r\none  day  rival and perhaps even exceed the size of the  real\r\n\r\nworld economy.  We have to have the right recipe to succeed - we  have  the entrepreneurs, we have the people who  are  Web\r\n\r\ntrained;  what  we  need  now is a bureaucracy  that  is  Net\r\n\r\nliterate and perhaps even Net savvy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major issue that will have a major impact on\r\n\r\nSingapore is the issue of an ageing population.  The  smaller\r\n\r\nfamilies  that  have  resulted from  our  earlier  successful\r\n\r\nfamily  planning programmes have meant that each family  will\r\n\r\nhave   more  difficulty  in  supporting  the  elderly,   both\r\n\r\nfinancially  and socially.  The small working  families,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  will find it extremely difficult to look after  the\r\n\r\nelderly,  especially  if  any one  of  their  parents  has  a\r\n\r\ndisabling  disease, such as a stroke or in  a  terminally-ill\r\n\r\ncondition.   Hence,  I  support  the  move  to  increase  the\r\n\r\npromotion  of  CDC as a social anchor in our community.   The\r\n\r\nCDCs  must  be equipped with the infrastructure as they  take\r\n\r\nupon  more responsibilities that were previously administered\r\n\r\nby  the  different Government agencies.  The CDC will be  the\r\n\r\nmost  appropriate body to coordinate the provision of  social\r\n\r\nservices and facilities for the aged and be the link  between\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries and the voluntary welfare organisations.   It\r\n\r\nshould  be a one-stop centre for the coordination of services\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly.  The volunteers who help the CDCs and  VWOs\r\n\r\nare  a  special  breed  of  people  and  though  they  do  it\r\n\r\nselflessly, we must never take their effort for  granted.   I\r\n\r\nthink more must be done to recognise their effort and time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as we move into the next millennium, we have\r\n\r\nto  recognise  these trends and act with more  speed  at  the\r\n\r\nfastest  pace if we want to succeed in building a  successful\r\n\r\nvirtual  Singapore  that  is  as  successful,  if  not   more\r\n\r\nsuccessful, than the real world Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nPresident, in his Address to Parliament, has outlined several\r\n\r\nnew\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand significant directives for the various Ministries.  These\r\n\r\ndirectives  will  put Singapore in good  stead  for  the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium  and I therefore would like to support the  motion\r\n\r\nof thanks to the President for his Address.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sense of urgency amongst the many healthcare\r\n\r\nproviders  who  wish to see our healthcare system  make  even\r\n\r\nmore adequate and affordable and even more effective in terms\r\n\r\nof  both cost and quality.  Ironically, it is not the lack of\r\n\r\nactivity  and  anxiety that bothers many.   It  is  the  very\r\n\r\nvibrant and tremendous pace of change happening to the  whole\r\n\r\nsystem that is worrying.  Sir, now is the time for us to look\r\n\r\nat  our  future needs and I seek indulgence of this House  to\r\n\r\ndeliberate  on  this  today.  I would like  to  suggest  that\r\n\r\nunless  we adopt a new mindset, there would not be any  scope\r\n\r\nfor  further significant improvements to our system when  the\r\n\r\nnew millennium unfolds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we planning adequately in accordance with the\r\n\r\nrequirements  of  the present and future  population  trends?\r\n\r\nHave  we  enough  safeguards against the very  fast  changing\r\n\r\ntrends  in  medicine  and medical technology?   Are  we  bold\r\n\r\nenough  to  discard  any remaining illogical  philosophy  and\r\n\r\nhistorical  baggage?  Are we utilising and  coordinating  our\r\n\r\nresources to the fullest?  I fear we do not have a resounding\r\n\r\n\"yes\" to all these questions just yet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our healthcare system is in a healthy state and\r\n\r\nthe  Government has done a very good job thus far, we are  in\r\n\r\nno  position  to  rest on our laurels.   We  have  many  good\r\n\r\npolicies in place and we would do well to keep them.  We also\r\n\r\nhave  some policies that require re-evaluation so  as  to  be\r\n\r\neither  improved  upon or removed from our forward  planning.\r\n\r\nThis  may involve fundamental changes in philosophy and  will\r\n\r\nrequire  the Government to be open-minded and willing  to  do\r\n\r\nthe right thing when the right thing comes along.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health has done well in keeping our\r\n\r\nhealthcare cost at about 3% of our GDP for the past 10 years.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Government's expenditure was 0.9%\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  GDP  last  year,  it  would be  seen  that  the  national\r\n\r\nhealthcare  expenditure  here  has  remained  relatively  low\r\n\r\ncompared  with other major industrialised countries.   It  is\r\n\r\nremarkable  that,  this notwithstanding, the  Government  can\r\n\r\nstill  affirm  that  no Singaporean will  be  denied  of  any\r\n\r\nmedical  treatment due to the lack of means.   Singapore  has\r\n\r\nengineered  and  given  sound foundations  to  the  Medisave,\r\n\r\nMediShield   and  Medifund  schemes  as  means  of   ensuring\r\n\r\naffordable   medical   healthcare.   By   improving   primary\r\n\r\nhealthcare affordability, controlling public hospital funding\r\n\r\nand  regulating  private hospital charges for Medisave  users\r\n\r\nthrough  a  \"casemix\" system, we expect  to  further  enhance\r\n\r\nquality affordable healthcare.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do have the broad picture of what we\r\n\r\nneed  to ensure \"good and cheap\" healthcare.  What we do have\r\n\r\nis  also the work ahead and the need for caution and care  in\r\n\r\nour  approach.  In this respect, Sir, I would be well pleased\r\n\r\nwhen the Ministry of Health could consider the suggestions  I\r\n\r\nhave on the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Capitalise fully on our \"talent\" pool of doctors.\r\n\r\nThere  should be a directive calling for better  use  of  our\r\n\r\nmedical  doctors and specialists.  Every year,  many  of  our\r\n\r\nbest brains in Singapore take up medicine.  We should have  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  talent  amongst our medical  doctors.   The  maximum\r\n\r\npotentials of many, especially those in the private practice,\r\n\r\nhave  not  been  harnessed.  The Ministry should  change  its\r\n\r\ncommonly  perceived  mindset of looking  at  the  doctors  in\r\n\r\npublic  and  private  sectors as two different  and  opposing\r\n\r\ncamps.  Sir, I would have thought that it would be better for\r\n\r\nall  doctors to work together as one continuum.   They  would\r\n\r\nall be better trying at all times to exchange new information\r\n\r\nand  experience,  to  share  the workload  of  looking  after\r\n\r\nsubsidised  patients, to help train junior  doctors,  and  to\r\n\r\nsave  on heavy expenditure by maximising joint usage of those\r\n\r\nexpensive technology and equipment.  The mindset must  be  to\r\n\r\nfunction as one force to further excel in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmedicine,  to  work  as a team steering ourselves  to  better\r\n\r\nheights  for  the  better  of all  patients  and  to  develop\r\n\r\nSingapore into a \"regional medical hub\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the stumbling block here is the Government's\r\n\r\ndirective,  as set out in the 1993 White Paper,  to  rely  on\r\n\r\ncompetition  and market forces to improve service  and  raise\r\n\r\nefficiency.  This mindset has been entrenched in our  medical\r\n\r\nsector for years, although it is a known fact that healthcare\r\n\r\nis  an  instance of market failure.  It is not good when  the\r\n\r\npublic  sector  starts  having to compete  with  the  private\r\n\r\nsector  and  it  is  worse when the  Ministry  of  Health  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  more  and more synonymous with the  public  sector.\r\n\r\nSir,  cooperation  rather  than competition  should  reap  us\r\n\r\nbetter  results here and there is a need for all  parties  to\r\n\r\nmodify or change the existing philosophy.  The details on how\r\n\r\nto  go about getting better use of all the medical doctors in\r\n\r\nSingapore are another topic by itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Make full use of our resources. Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nall  our hospitals should complement rather than compete with\r\n\r\neach  other.   Better  cooperation  between  hospitals  would\r\n\r\nenable  us to maximise our own resources.  It would be better\r\n\r\nif  there  is  no excessive re-duplication of  specialty  and\r\n\r\nespecially super specialty services.  It would also be better\r\n\r\nto  allow  for  the  free  flow of medical  personnel,  where\r\n\r\napplicable,  to  maximise the results  of  service.   At  the\r\n\r\nmoment, even public hospitals compete with each other.  Terms\r\n\r\nlike   'double  standards',  'competition',  'level   playing\r\n\r\nfields',   'limited  use  of  Medisave'  and  the  like   are\r\n\r\nfrequently used nowadays.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many restructured hospitals are under pressure to\r\n\r\nperform well, especially in monetary \"bottom-line\" at the end\r\n\r\nof  each  year.   If  that becomes the dominant  factor,  the\r\n\r\nensuing policies that the hospitals make will invariably take\r\n\r\non  pecuniary  inclinations.   Consider,  for  instance,  the\r\n\r\nsituation when hospitals remunerate doctors for the number of\r\n\r\npatients they see.  Theoretically, the doctors might hold  on\r\n\r\nto  a few more of those patients that could be discharged and\r\n\r\nthereby increase\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir   patient-load.    The  resultant   effect   would   be\r\n\r\ninsufficient  time  being allocated  to  each  patient.   The\r\n\r\npatients  would  be at a disadvantage because  the  excessive\r\n\r\nnumbers of patients would diminish the quality of care.  This\r\n\r\nis  another  example of market failure at work.  Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Ministry of Health must have directives that ensure\r\n\r\nour  public hospitals are there to treat our sick and not  to\r\n\r\nmake money with Government subvention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Prioritise preventive healthcare. The directive on\r\n\r\npreventive  healthcare should be put firmly  in  place.   The\r\n\r\nvarious  Ministries involved should work in concert and  view\r\n\r\nthis  as a matter of priority.  The successful implementation\r\n\r\nof preventive healthcare will translate into quality life for\r\n\r\nour  people and with enormous savings for the people and  the\r\n\r\nnation  on  healthcare  cost.  Sir, I  have  brought  up  and\r\n\r\ndiscussed  this  important  issue at  an  Adjournment  motion\r\n\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Plan for an ageing population. It is important for\r\n\r\nus to adopt correct and effective policies in this area right\r\n\r\nnow so that we may cater for the diverse and varied needs  of\r\n\r\nan  ageing population.  Done the right way, we will  also  be\r\n\r\ncushioned  against increasing demands in future.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat the President, in his Presidential Address, referred  to\r\n\r\nthe  recommendations  of the Inter-Ministerial  Committee  on\r\n\r\nAgeing  Population and said, \"We must start now to  implement\r\n\r\npolicies  and programmes to address these future needs.\"   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, bear in mind that the ageing people will be the\r\n\r\nmain users of our medical healthcare, I would suggest that we\r\n\r\nconsider the following points:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Plan for more \"cheaper to run\" community hospitals\r\n\r\nfor the chronic sick.  We do not need more acute hospitals as\r\n\r\nwe do have more than enough of them at the moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) We need to better postulate the needs of an ageing\r\n\r\npopulation,  especially in terms of  the  number  of  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes,    dementia    homes,   geriatric   departments    and\r\n\r\ngeriatricians.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We seriously consider the most effective way to\r\n\r\ncater for the chronic sick in the future and that would be to\r\n\r\nget  the  primary healthcare doctors to share  the  workload.\r\n\r\nSir,  I would like to declare, at this juncture, that I am  a\r\n\r\nprimary healthcare doctor.  Shared care and step-down care to\r\n\r\nthe  primary practitioners will certainly reduce the  use  of\r\n\r\nacute  hospitals and community hospitals.  Moreover, patients\r\n\r\nwill  also benefit through staying at home and close to their\r\n\r\nown families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) We increase the teaching of gerontology for all\r\n\r\nmedical  personnel  and  establish  geriatrics  as  a  worthy\r\n\r\nspecialty for younger doctors to pursue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Establish better distribution of subsidy. Directive\r\n\r\non  funding  should  be towards better  distribution  of  the\r\n\r\nsubsidy to those that are really in need.  We must make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no loophole in our system that  may  lead  to\r\n\r\nabuse,   misuse  or  \"buffet  syndrome\".   Singaporeans   are\r\n\r\npragmatic  and  will  usually  not  \"waste\"  any  windows  of\r\n\r\nopportunity   that  comes  to  hand.   Our  present   subsidy\r\n\r\nguidelines are not the most rational because anyone  can  get\r\n\r\nthe maximum subsidy if he so chooses.  The Ministry of Health\r\n\r\ndoes  not  apply any \"means test\" as compared to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Community  Development  or  the  Ministry  of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  New funding for the chronic sick for  long-term\r\n\r\nhealthcare  should  be  worked  out  as  soon  as   possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps,  we  should  look at utilising  a  Medisave-type  of\r\n\r\nfunding here.  A lot of work will be needed to establish  the\r\n\r\ncriteria on the use of funds for long-term healthcare as  in,\r\n\r\nsay, how primary healthcare providers could be remunerated in\r\n\r\na reasonable and controlled manner to ensure affordability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fortunate here in Singapore. We\r\n\r\nhave  the  means to afford world-class medical care  for  our\r\n\r\npeople.   We have the personnel and premises to dispense  the\r\n\r\nmedical  excellence to our people.  We also have an abundance\r\n\r\nof  ideas  and  means to turn this country  into  a  regional\r\n\r\nmedical  hub we allude to not infrequently.  So let  us  make\r\n\r\nsure we get the best mileage from what we have.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of thanks on the President's\r\n\r\nAddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

On Monday, Mr  Chiam\r\n\r\nSee   Tong   said  that  the  philosophy  in   Singapore   is\r\n\r\nauthoritarianism  because  it is based  on  Confucianism.  He\r\n\r\ncould  not  have been more wrong.  Confucianism  advocates  a\r\n\r\nbenevolent government like what  the famous Tang poet  Du  Fu\r\n\r\ndescribed in one of his poems, \"Build thousands of  homes  to\r\n\r\nshelter   the   poor  and  make  them  happy.\"   Confucianism\r\n\r\nemphasizes  \"cultivating  the moral  characters  of  oneself,\r\n\r\nputting  the family in good order\" as a basis of the  people-focused  philosophy  in  ruling the  country.   Due  to  time\r\n\r\nconstraint  I am unable to spend time to explain the  details\r\n\r\nto Mr Chiam in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite him a historical fact to prove him wrong.\r\n\r\nJust  imagine, if Confucianism is authoritarianism, then  why\r\n\r\nhad the first Emperor of China, Qing Shi Huang, to bury alive\r\n\r\nthe  Confucian scholars and to burn the Confucian books?   Mr\r\n\r\nChiam's  one-sided evaluation of Confucism  and  the   NCMP's\r\n\r\nlopsided criticism of the President's Speech reminded  me  of\r\n\r\nthe  story about a blind man describing the elephant, as told\r\n\r\nto me by my teacher when I was a little boy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we have some real-life examples\r\n\r\nhere.   When we discuss national issues and topics  affecting\r\n\r\nthe  daily lives of our people, we should first make some in-depth studies and research from a macro view.  We should  not\r\n\r\ngeneralize and be lopsided in our assessment.  Otherwise,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be like the blind man who caught hold of the elephant's\r\n\r\ntrunk and said that the elephant was like a snake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Singapore's key competitive strengths is its\r\n\r\nactive  and effective practice of tripartism.  As one of  the\r\n\r\nsocial  partners, the labour movement in Singapore  has  over\r\n\r\nthe   years,   strengthened  its  commitment  to   harmonious\r\n\r\nindustrial relations as well as raising productivity  at  the\r\n\r\nworkplace.   Our  unions understand that a  better  life  for\r\n\r\nworkers  and their families is only possible when investments\r\n\r\nare forthcoming and good jobs are available.  To ensure this,\r\n\r\nall  the  tripartite partners should continue to work closely\r\n\r\nfor  a  harmonious  industrial climate and industrial  peace.\r\n\r\nSo,  we have to help our workers acquire the requisite skills\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  challenges that lie ahead and  give  them  the\r\n\r\nrelevant and proper knowledge and skills that we can continue\r\n\r\nto remain competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the increasing global competition, jobs that\r\n\r\nare  deemed the iron rice bowl may well become a thing of the\r\n\r\npast.   This  kind of long-term job security does  not  exist\r\n\r\nanymore.   Our goal is how to ensure life-long employability.\r\n\r\nAs the old Chinese saying goes, \"as you live till an old age,\r\n\r\nyou  must keep on learning\". This is even more true today  as\r\n\r\nwe move towards a knowledge-based economy. As Mr Matthias Yao\r\n\r\nhad  said,  our workers need a completely new set of  skills,\r\n\r\nvery  different  from those applicable to our early years  of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.   Our  workers  must  continually  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir  skills  and knowledge so that they  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\nperform better than others. It is only then that they will be\r\n\r\nable  to operate computers and other advanced equipment.   We\r\n\r\nneed  workers to constantly make use of knowledge and perform\r\n\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent article in the Far Eastern Economic Review\r\n\r\nobserved  how  countries like Singapore had  scored  well  in\r\n\r\nlabour   rankings,  aided  more  by  factors  like  political\r\n\r\nstability,  infrastructure  and telecommunications.   But  we\r\n\r\nshould  not be too quick to pop the champagne as the  article\r\n\r\nwent  on  to say and I quote, \"And they (Singapore  and  Hong\r\n\r\nKong)  cease  to  be competitive in tasks such  as  technical\r\n\r\nsupport and accounting.  Hong Kong and Singapore will need to\r\n\r\nimprove  general education levels to prepare their  workforce\r\n\r\nfor  more  sophisticated  white collar  jobs.\"   Indeed,  the\r\n\r\narticle  cited  a  study by the Political and  Economic  Risk\r\n\r\nConsultancy (PERC) that Singapore fared poorly as far as  the\r\n\r\nquality,   cost  and  availability  of  skilled  labour   are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  So companies that require large numbers of manual\r\n\r\nworkers will continue to be moved out of Singapore to cheaper\r\n\r\nlocations.  To stay employable, our people must have  a  good\r\n\r\ngrasp  of  the  core  skills. We must be  able  to  do  this,\r\n\r\notherwise  our workers will have to suffer from  unemployment\r\n\r\nand hardship because of severe structural unemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the knowledge-based economy, workers must have a\r\n\r\nreasonable degree of skills and know-how.  If workers are not\r\n\r\nup  to it, they will find it difficult to find jobs here  and\r\n\r\nyou cannot compete with others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, when we are facing the challenges of\r\n\r\nthe  21st  century,  we have to build up  our  heartware  and\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion so that we will not be phased out.  We  must\r\n\r\nnot  overlook  the consolidation and the maintenance  of  the\r\n\r\nheartware.  I hope that the employers will cooperate with the\r\n\r\nunions to provide a better and safer working environment   to\r\n\r\nensure that the employees enjoy good health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern computer may be attacked by virus and it\r\n\r\nbecomes paralysed.   Likewise, the workers' productivity  and\r\n\r\nefficiency  may  be  affected by  illnesses  or  occupational\r\n\r\nhazards  that  cause them to be unable to  work  effectively.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter which we must look into seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Health Survey 1998 showed that hypertension\r\n\r\nhas increased\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  27%  of the population recently and for high cholesterol,\r\n\r\nit  has  gone up to 24%.  Diabetes affected 9% of  the  adult\r\n\r\npopulation.  The situation is more alarming among  the  older\r\n\r\npeople. Among those in their 50s or older, half of them  have\r\n\r\nhypertension, 2 out of 3 have high cholesterol, and 1 in 5 is\r\n\r\ndiabetic.  For those in their 60s and above, it is even  more\r\n\r\nalarming.   Over  3 in 5 have hypertension,  half  have  high\r\n\r\ncholesterol and 1 in 3 is diabetic.  More than half  had  not\r\n\r\nbeen  previously  diagnosed and this is also  very  alarming.\r\n\r\nThey  do  not  know  that  they are having  health  problems.\r\n\r\nAnother  area of concern is that 3 in 4 think that  Singapore\r\n\r\nis a stressful place to live in.  Although a little stress is\r\n\r\ngood  for  motivation in work, chronic stress could  lead  to\r\n\r\nserious health breakdown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we hope to see more employers carrying\r\n\r\nout  workplace  health programmes to help  the  workers  look\r\n\r\nafter  their health.  There is a need to set up a  structural\r\n\r\nframework such as a simple annual health screening to  detect\r\n\r\nhealth  risk  factors and medical problems among the  workers\r\n\r\nearly,  so  as  to prevent complications and  disability.   A\r\n\r\nfollow-up programme can then be established at workplaces  to\r\n\r\nhelp  promote healthy lifestyle, encourage people to exercise\r\n\r\nregularly,  and have regular health checks.  It  is  just  as\r\n\r\nimportant that workers choose healthier diets, learn to  cope\r\n\r\nwith stress and say \"no\" to cigarettes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to further improve occupational safety and\r\n\r\nhealth  at the workplace to minimise the number of industrial\r\n\r\naccidents and incidence of occupational diseases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of offenders paying\r\n\r\ncomposition fines for infringement of safety rules  increased\r\n\r\nfrom  2,617 in 1997 to 3,218 in 1998.  Last year, 99  workers\r\n\r\ndied in industrial accidents, and 162 others were permanently\r\n\r\ndisabled.   There  were 897 confirmed occupational  diseases,\r\n\r\nwith  674  suffering  from noise-induced  deafness,  and  132\r\n\r\nothers  from  industrial  dermatitis.   Occupational  disease\r\n\r\ncases with permanent disability for the last three\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nyears,  from  1996 to 1998, were 96.  Our workers  deserve  a\r\n\r\nsafer working environment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthy living is as important as a safe working\r\n\r\nenvironment.  Healthy workers are more productive.  Enhancing\r\n\r\nthe quality of life of workers is the primary objective of  a\r\n\r\ntrade  union.   Job creation, job security,  a  safe  working\r\n\r\nenvironment and good wages will be meaningless if our workers\r\n\r\nare unable to reap the benefits because of their poor health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the survival of Singapore depends, to a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent, on our ability to continue to be  relevant  to\r\n\r\nthe  market place in the world.  This primarily rests on  the\r\n\r\nskill  levels  of our workers.  But this alone  will  not  be\r\n\r\nsufficient.    The skilled worker will be of no use  when  he\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  be  on  medical leave or he  works  under  the\r\n\r\nimpending  dangers to his health and life at  the  workplace.\r\n\r\nThis  is  an awesome challenge that requires no less  than  a\r\n\r\nfull  commitment from the Government, the employers  and  the\r\n\r\nunions  working hand in hand.  This is a very important  area\r\n\r\nthat  we  must look into.  So all the three partners  in  the\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  Singapore  must  work  together  closely   to\r\n\r\nimplement  measures to ensure the safety of our workers,  how\r\n\r\nto  safeguard  our  human resource as our  asset.   Sir,  our\r\n\r\nworkers are our very important asset and we have to face this\r\n\r\nnew challenge to enhance our work safety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion  be  exempted  at  this  day's  sitting  from  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DEBATE ON PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nexcited by the programme of the Government which\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfocuses  on  people development.  The concrete plans  to  re-engineer the education system, upgrade worker skills,  caring\r\n\r\nfor  the  aged  and  the  disadvantaged,  and  preparing  the\r\n\r\npopulation  for  the  IT age are indeed commendable.   It  is\r\n\r\nsomething we can achieve, and achieve well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also commend the Government for being bold in\r\n\r\nrecognising the challenges that lie ahead for the nation  and\r\n\r\nwhat it intends to do to meet it head on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am even more impressed by what it intends to do\r\n\r\nin  the sphere of active citizenship.  The move to engage the\r\n\r\ncitizens in every sphere of Singapore life is laudable and is\r\n\r\nprogressing gradually and well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizenship is a concept that has to be\r\n\r\nunderstood  well by all players.  Mr Davinder Singh,  in  his\r\n\r\nopening address, has highlighted well that the people look to\r\n\r\nthe   Government   for  a  road  map  with  clear   pointers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,  the  private  sector  is  also  looking  to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment for these clear pointers.  Naturally, there is  an\r\n\r\nassumption  that the Government has charted the  terrain  and\r\n\r\nhas marked it with clear pointers, but that such a map is not\r\n\r\navailable for public use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I reckon the truth is that the Government is also\r\n\r\nmoving  into  uncharted  terrain.  I think  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleague, Mr Davinder Singh, put it aptly when he said  that\r\n\r\neven  at  the  top \"we are still grappling for some  form  of\r\n\r\nconsensus  about  the  desirable pace  of  change.\"   So  the\r\n\r\nreality may be that there is no road map, more so a road  map\r\n\r\nwith clear pointers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can there be a road map with clear pointers in real life\r\n\r\nwhen  the  terrain  itself is not surveyed and  planted  with\r\n\r\nmarkers?   We have to work together as pioneers to chart  the\r\n\r\nterrain collectively  premised on a common purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to recognise that there are some things in life\r\n\r\nthat  one  cannot put down in detail.  Even a good  road  map\r\n\r\nsometimes  does  not  point  the  hidden  danger  zones   and\r\n\r\npotholes.  One has to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntravel  the road to discover the road and the pitfalls there.\r\n\r\nWe may meet speed cameras, bumps, potholes, traffic policemen\r\n\r\nand  other  impediments.  Different drivers  also  react  and\r\n\r\ndrive  differently according to temperament  and  experience.\r\n\r\nWe  become wiser and experienced.  We must also know that  if\r\n\r\none  takes great risk and drives dangerously, we can endanger\r\n\r\nourselves, our passengers and other road users.  It all boils\r\n\r\ndown to a call of judgment.  I hope my analogy highlights the\r\n\r\nreal  life situation.  In real life, everyone, including  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, has to make a judgment call.  When, how  and  why\r\n\r\nit will be made cannot be predicted as there are many factors\r\n\r\nthat will be at play.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must also acknowledge that all this call for active\r\n\r\ncitizenship  will  come  to  a  dead  end  if  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership is keen but the bureaucracy resists the  same  and\r\n\r\nfears  encroachment and criticism.  Similarly, it would  fail\r\n\r\nin  its infancy if the political leadership takes to task any\r\n\r\nunconstructive disagreement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the credit of the Government and the civil\r\n\r\nservice, they have accepted the need for active citizens  and\r\n\r\nhave  come  out with several steps to engage them  in  policy\r\n\r\nmaking.  I can vouch for it because I have seen it in  action\r\n\r\nin innumerable instances.  The bigger question is whether the\r\n\r\npeople really understand what is meant by active citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a pool of intellectuals in Singapore who\r\n\r\nare   naturally  excited  and  are  looking  forward  to  the\r\n\r\nblossoming  of  a  civil society.  Here, I must  caution  the\r\n\r\nadvocates  of  the civil society itself.  There  are  varying\r\n\r\ndefinitions  of civil society among different theorists.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  two scholars, Michael W. Foley and Bob Edwards,  wrote\r\n\r\nan  article  in the Journal of Democracy, Vol. 7.3,  entitled\r\n\r\n\"The Paradox of Civil Society\".  In their article, they state\r\n\r\n(if I may summarise the gist) that some see civil society  as\r\n\r\na  state  where  non-government  organisations  spontaneously\r\n\r\nappear to allow for participation and involvement by citizens\r\n\r\nin  non-political  areas such as social clubs  and  volunteer\r\n\r\norganisations.  They call it civil society\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmodel  1,  and  this  is their first definition.   Robert  D.\r\n\r\nPutman  who  is  an advocate of this model states  that  such\r\n\r\nassociations must not be polarised and politicised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What these organisations attempt to do is that they\r\n\r\nattempt  to bridge social and political divisions  and  thus,\r\n\r\npresumably, are autonomous from political forces.  The  issue\r\n\r\nthen  arises:  how  can  such  associations  shape  political\r\n\r\nparticipation  and  \"civic engagement\"  without  engaging  in\r\n\r\nspecifically   political  issues  and  without   representing\r\n\r\ncompelling  social interests?  Can these organisations  under\r\n\r\nthe  civil  society  model 1 really  meet  the  clamour  from\r\n\r\nSingaporeans for greater participation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another group of theorists who advocate\r\n\r\nthat  the  civil  society becomes a check on undemocratic  or\r\n\r\ntyrannical governments.  This version is articulated by Jacek\r\n\r\nKuron, Adam Michnik and others.  Clearly, they see their role\r\n\r\nas  harbingers of democratic change and see their involvement\r\n\r\nin politics as natural.  These theorists lay special emphasis\r\n\r\non civil society as a sphere of action that is independent of\r\n\r\nthe  state and that is capable of energising resistance to  a\r\n\r\ntyrannical  regime.  This is the model seen in  the  past  in\r\n\r\nmany Latin American and Eastern European states.  And I would\r\n\r\ncall it the civil society model 2.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as you can see, at the definition stage, there is a\r\n\r\ndegree of great difference between civil society model 1  and\r\n\r\nmodel 2, for while the former postulates the positive effects\r\n\r\nof  association  for  governance, the latter  emphasises  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  civil association as a counterweight  to  the\r\n\r\nstate.    There  is  no  reason,  in  principle,   why   this\r\n\r\ncounterweight of civil society will not become a burden to  a\r\n\r\ndemocracy or an authoritarian state.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the two scholars, Michael W. Foley and Bob\r\n\r\nEdwards,  in the same article \"The Paradox of Civil  Society\"\r\n\r\ndescribed that the \"concept of civil society seems to take on\r\n\r\nthe  property of a gas, expanding or contracting to  fit  the\r\n\r\nanalytic space afforded it by each historical or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsocio-political setting.\"  That is how elusive the concept of\r\n\r\ncivil society is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is clear is that the civil society model 1\r\n\r\ndoes  not entail participants entering the sphere of politics\r\n\r\nand challenging the state (or government) as a counterweight.\r\n\r\nThose  who  insist  on  pushing  a  political  agenda  or  on\r\n\r\nchallenging the government of the day should then move on  to\r\n\r\nthe  arena  of  political organisations.   The civil  society\r\n\r\nmodel 2, as it stands, cannot be acceptable in Singapore as a\r\n\r\ncounterweight to the Government, because we have a Government\r\n\r\nthat is democratically elected in elections every five years,\r\n\r\nand  only they have the right of representing the people  and\r\n\r\nof  making  key  decisions for the people.   However,  it  is\r\n\r\nunclear  which  is  the  model  that  the  civil  society  of\r\n\r\nSingapore will become.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the statement by the hon. NMPs, Mr Zulkifli\r\n\r\nBaharudin  and  Mr Simon Tay, that they will  look  into  the\r\n\r\nchallenges  facing  civil society in  Singapore.   But  as  I\r\n\r\nlistened to the speech of Mr Simon Tay earlier, I noted  that\r\n\r\nthey  will  be addressing three issues:  (1) registration  of\r\n\r\nsocieties;  (2) the limit of speeches; and (3)  the  role  of\r\n\r\ngovernment, private society and civil society.  What I  would\r\n\r\nurge them to do is try, in the first place, to establish what\r\n\r\nexactly  is  the  type  of  civil society  that  we  want  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, because if they do not clarify right at the outset\r\n\r\nwhat  is the type of civil society that we wish to create  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  looking at the two models that are  available,  I\r\n\r\nthink there is potential for conflict ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that it is no help to ask the Government to\r\n\r\ndefine  the scope of participation for civil society  as,  by\r\n\r\nits  nature, civil society must be spontaneous and autonomous\r\n\r\nof  state.   Even  if  the Government  were  to  define  such\r\n\r\nparameters as called by Mr Davinder Singh, would it not  then\r\n\r\nbe accused of setting OB markers and be accused of stifling a\r\n\r\ngreater   civil  society?   Similarly,  the  very  call   for\r\n\r\ntolerance of constructive disagreement is a sine qua non  for\r\n\r\ntrouble, as the issue\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narises   who   defines   constructive,   or   its   corollary\r\n\r\ndestructive,  disagreement.   Naturally,  everyone  with  the\r\n\r\npresent  mindset will look to the Government  to  define  the\r\n\r\nsame.   But  then, would we not all come back to  square  one\r\n\r\nwhere all is state defined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, just as much as Mr Simon Tay earlier called in\r\n\r\nhis  speech for a civil society, I noted that he called  upon\r\n\r\nthe  Feedback Unit to come back with measures on how  to  get\r\n\r\nmore   feedback,   and   also  how  the  various   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  had  failed in certain aspects.   Civil  society\r\n\r\nnaturally  must  also be involved and that there  must  be  a\r\n\r\nspontaneous reaction from people to see how they can  improve\r\n\r\nthe society and the nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was even more amused that in today's Straits\r\n\r\nTimes, Mr Zulkifli Baharudin has called (i) on the Government\r\n\r\nto   help   finance  organisations  and  lend  administrative\r\n\r\nsupport;  and  (ii) for civil servants and GLC  employees  to\r\n\r\nbecome   involved  in  civic  groups.    This  is  in  itself\r\n\r\nunacceptable  to the purists of the civil society  proponents\r\n\r\nwho  do  not want to see the hand of the Government in  civil\r\n\r\nsociety.   Even if one were to accept Mr Zulkifli's call  for\r\n\r\nhelp, would not the civil society then be accused of being  a\r\n\r\n\"guided civil society\"?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the full extent of the plea of Mr Zulkifli is\r\n\r\nanalysed, one would realise that we will be back to where  we\r\n\r\nare   now.   We  already  have  a  \"dense  network  of  civil\r\n\r\norganisations\"  which  is considered necessary  for  a  civil\r\n\r\nsociety,  and  which is a key requirement for civil  society.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  purists do not realise that in the real  world,\r\n\r\nthere  can be no civil society in a vacuum and that you  need\r\n\r\nsupport, whether from government, political parties or  other\r\n\r\ninterest groups to survive, thrive and stay relevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my wish that we create our own model civil\r\n\r\nsociety  which  meets our requirements, our  aspirations  and\r\n\r\ncommon purpose.  In the process, Sir, it is equally important\r\n\r\nthat  we  do not exclude the existing key components  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe  should  include the grassroots organisations, our  unions\r\n\r\nand  many  other organisations which are present in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  any civil society that we intend to create because  civil\r\n\r\nsociety must mean participation by everybody in that society.\r\n\r\nIt is something for thought for everyone.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call to all Singaporeans is that the Government is\r\n\r\nready  for  active citizenry.  The ball is  in  the  people's\r\n\r\ncourt. They decide what is the appropriate model.  You may be\r\n\r\nrebuked  unexpectedly.  You may be challenged vigorously  and\r\n\r\nnot too subtly, but change, particularly radical change, does\r\n\r\nnot come easily and we may have to work together to reach our\r\n\r\ndestination together.  One must never forget the key  message\r\n\r\nin  the  President's  Address that the Government  wishes  to\r\n\r\nengage  all its citizens in a constructive manner in  various\r\n\r\naspects of decision making and to get Singaporeans to play  a\r\n\r\ngreater constructive role in national life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have defined politics as a serious business in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If some Singaporeans see civil society as a cloak\r\n\r\nto  make  good  populist speeches and not take responsibility\r\n\r\nfor  it,  then  my advice is, go join the Toastmasters'  Club\r\n\r\nwhere  good speeches get commended.  But if there are serious\r\n\r\npeople  who  want to champion political issues  or  political\r\n\r\ncauses,  then  join political organisations and champion  the\r\n\r\ncause or seek to become an NMP.  Let us all welcome this  new\r\n\r\ndynamic  phase  of  national development,  ie,  building  the\r\n\r\nheartware.  Let us all collectively survey the terrain,  mark\r\n\r\nout  the  safe and unsafe areas and work together  in  making\r\n\r\nSingapore our home the best home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>3.48 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nat  the  Opening  of the last Session of Parliament  in  June\r\n\r\n1997,  I spoke on Singapore 21 and our vision for a new  era.\r\n\r\nBut  visions  must confront realities, and in case  our  feet\r\n\r\nleft the ground, I cautioned that there were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany things in the future we could not possibly foresee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month later, a financial crisis erupted in Thailand,\r\n\r\nswept  across  Asia,  and devastated several  economies.   It\r\n\r\npermanently  changed the strategic landscape in  the  region.\r\n\r\nThe  forces of change that the regional crisis unleashed  are\r\n\r\nstill at work, and we do not yet know their full impact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could have foreseen the traumatic changes in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  or  that Singapore, at the UN's  and  Indonesia's\r\n\r\ninvitation, is participating in the INTERFET mission in  East\r\n\r\nTimor?  What will Indonesia be like after 20th October when a\r\n\r\nnew  President is chosen?  What will the region  be  like  in\r\n\r\nfive years' time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, technology and globalisation will continue\r\n\r\nto   transform  businesses,  economic  structures  and  human\r\n\r\nsociety.  We have to face intense economic competition in  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  borderless  world, and  manage  change  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This volatility and uncertainty in our regional\r\n\r\nenvironment  and  the rapidity of changes in  the  world  are\r\n\r\nrealities we have to live with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response should be strategic and robust. In\r\n\r\nessence,  we  shall focus on our people, investing  in  them,\r\n\r\nenhancing   their  capabilities,  stretching   their   minds,\r\n\r\nstimulating  their creative and entrepreneurial  spirit,  and\r\n\r\nharnessing  their  ideas and energy to  build  a  first-world\r\n\r\neconomy and a world-class home.  This is our bold strategy to\r\n\r\ntackle the challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first-world economy and a world-class home are not two\r\n\r\nseparate  goals.  They are two sides of the  same  coin.   We\r\n\r\nneed the resources from a sound, competitive economy to build\r\n\r\na  world-class home, and we need a world-class home to anchor\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to create a first-world economy for Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the two facets, a first-world economy is the\r\n\r\neasier  goal to achieve.  Our economic foundation  is  strong\r\n\r\nand our reputation as a pro-business economy is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexcellent.   By implementing the right policies  consistently\r\n\r\nand building new capabilities, we will succeed in becoming  a\r\n\r\nfirst-world economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a world-class home presents a trickier\r\n\r\nchallenge.   It  is  not  just  about  nice  houses,   modern\r\n\r\nconveniences  and  bright city lights.  It is  about  people,\r\n\r\nrelationships,  motivation, commitment,  passion,  dedication\r\n\r\nand  determination.   The irony is that  the  more  Singapore\r\n\r\nimproves  its infrastructure and amenities, the  less  unique\r\n\r\nand   indistinguishable  from  other   cities   it   becomes.\r\n\r\nSingapore   risks  becoming  like  one  of  those   well-run,\r\n\r\ncomfortable  international hotels which  successful  business\r\n\r\nexecutives check in and out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Building a world-class home</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes a home different from a hotel is where the\r\n\r\nheart is.  Most homes are less comfortable than a hotel,  but\r\n\r\nthey  are  where the people feel they belong, where they  are\r\n\r\nking  and  where they can decorate and arrange the  furniture\r\n\r\nanyway they like.  This, in essence, is what distinguishes  a\r\n\r\nhome  from  a hotel.  Singapore is a place where Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan  be  themselves, where they can make  a  difference,  and\r\n\r\nwhere they care for one another and rally together when faced\r\n\r\nwith  challenges.  The best home for Singaporeans is a world-class home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to highlight two demographic trends which\r\n\r\nmay undermine our effort to build our world-class home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Falling fertility rates</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first trend concerns the growth of the population.\r\n\r\nThe  statistics  show  clearly  that  we  are  not  replacing\r\n\r\nourselves.   This is a serious problem.  The  Government  has\r\n\r\nwarned  against this trend 12 years ago.  We tried to reverse\r\n\r\nit but we have not been successful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Total Fertility Rate or TFR has fallen steadily\r\n\r\nsince  1990,  despite our scrapping the \"Stop At Two\"  policy\r\n\r\nand encouraging\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmarried  couples to \"Have three or more, if  you  can  afford\r\n\r\nit\".   The  TFR is a fertility indicator which shows  whether\r\n\r\nthe   population  is  replacing  itself.   A  population   is\r\n\r\nconsidered to be replacing itself if it can maintain a TFR of\r\n\r\nabout  two.   This means a woman in our population  would  on\r\n\r\naverage  have  two  children in her lifetime.   Our  TFR  has\r\n\r\nfallen steadily from 1.87 in 1990 to 1.5 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1998 was the Year of the Tiger so one would not expect a\r\n\r\nlarge  number of births.  But the Year of the Rabbit has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  prolific  either.  The number of births  in  the  first\r\n\r\neight  months  is, in fact, 3% lower than that  of  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod last year.  Unless the Rabbit surprises us in the next\r\n\r\nthree months, the TFR for 1999 is likely to fall below 1.5.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1987 when I announced the Government's New Population\r\n\r\nPolicy,  I  also expressed the hope that there  would  be  at\r\n\r\nleast 50,000 births a year.  This provides the minimum cohort\r\n\r\nsize  to  sustain  our economy, defence  and  other  manpower\r\n\r\nneeds.  Our actual birth numbers were nowhere near the 50,000\r\n\r\nmark  in the past five years.  In 1998, the number of  births\r\n\r\ncame  to  only  43,664,  far short of  the  target  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment set.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this declining fertility trend persists, and it is\r\n\r\nlikely  to  be  the  case, our citizen  population  of  three\r\n\r\nmillion will grow to about 3.5 million by 2030 and then start\r\n\r\nto  decline.   Ang Mong Seng and Dr Michael  Lim  raised  the\r\n\r\nneeds of the old.  The needs of the old will become even more\r\n\r\nacute  after 2030.  The proportion of older people then  will\r\n\r\nbe  far higher compared to what it is today.  There will also\r\n\r\nbe  fewer  people in the working-age group.  This means  that\r\n\r\nthe  3.5  million people in Singapore in 2030 may not produce\r\n\r\nsufficient  wealth to look after the needs  of  the  old  and\r\n\r\nsociety  in  general.  Can a shrinking population  sustain  a\r\n\r\nfirst-world economy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics also show that the more educated mothers\r\n\r\nare,  the  fewer  kids they are likely  to  have.   The  more\r\n\r\neducated  have  on average a family size that  is  about  15%\r\n\r\nsmaller  than those with lower education.  As the educational\r\n\r\nstandard of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  people will go up, we must expect our TFR to  fall  even\r\n\r\nfurther.   There  are many reasons for the  declining  TFR  - urbanisation, education, changing lifestyles, singlehood  and\r\n\r\nlate  marriages.  Having babies also involve personal choices\r\n\r\nand  trade-offs.  I am not optimistic that we can  achieve  a\r\n\r\nsignificant increase in fertility level.  But we  must  never\r\n\r\ngive  up trying to get Singaporeans who can afford it to have\r\n\r\nmore  children.  Dr Jennifer Lee talked about incentives  for\r\n\r\nfathers.   I  am  not sure paternity leave  is  the  solution\r\n\r\nbecause  our  main  problem is the large  number  of  highly-educated  women  who remain single.  Among those  with  post-secondary qualifications, about one  in five women is  likely\r\n\r\nto  remain  single  in her life time.   So  we  must  try  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  marriage rate of our women,  especially  those\r\n\r\nwith higher education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Adopting an \"inclusive\" mindset</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that our citizen population is not replacing\r\n\r\nitself,  we have no choice but to top up our population  with\r\n\r\nnew  immigrants.   They provide a much-needed  boost  to  our\r\n\r\nmanpower  strength, augmenting shortfalls in  the  productive\r\n\r\nage groups and increasing our talent pool.  Since we have  to\r\n\r\ntake  in  new  immigrants, we should be selective,  admitting\r\n\r\nonly  those  with  skills, high education and  talents,  from\r\n\r\nwherever  they  are.  This way, we make sure that  foreigners\r\n\r\nwho  become  Permanent  Residents  and  Singaporeans  are   a\r\n\r\ndefinite   plus   to   our   country.    These   foreign-born\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will help enhance the vibrancy and  dynamism  of\r\n\r\nour economy and society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should make every effort to absorb these foreign-born\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  into our society.  We should  strengthen  their\r\n\r\ncommitment  by giving them a sense of ownership of  Singapore\r\n\r\ntoo.   This  inclusive approach will ensure that a generation\r\n\r\nfrom  now, these new Singaporeans and their children will  be\r\n\r\nas  nationalistic as any one of us.  Their children will have\r\n\r\nto do national service as Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singaporeans Overseas</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the second trend - the increased\r\n\r\nnumber  of Singaporeans going overseas.  I asked the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Manpower how many Singaporeans are overseas on a long-term\r\n\r\nbasis.   The  Ministry came up with an estimate  of  150,000,\r\n\r\nwhich included working adults and their dependants, emigrants\r\n\r\nand students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the number of Good Conduct Certificates issued\r\n\r\nby  the  Police,  each year some 2,000 Singaporeans  pack  up\r\n\r\ntheir bags and emigrate.  More than half are females, many of\r\n\r\nwhom  married  foreigners and leave Singapore to  join  their\r\n\r\nhusbands.   There are also some 6,000 applications to  MINDEF\r\n\r\neach  year  for  reservist training deferment on  grounds  of\r\n\r\noverseas employment of duration longer than six months.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we like it or not, more Singaporeans will take\r\n\r\nwing,  given the pace of globalisation and their own personal\r\n\r\nmobility.  As Singaporeans become even more cosmopolitan, the\r\n\r\nissue  of  concern  to us is whether they  will  become  less\r\n\r\nrooted  to  Singapore.  We now have to even compete  for  the\r\n\r\nhearts of Singaporeans against attractions elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Developing each and every Singaporean</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this background, you will appreciate better the\r\n\r\nsignificance  of  the statement - every Singaporean  matters.\r\n\r\nThere  are not many of us to build and protect our home.   So\r\n\r\nwe  have to provide every Singaporean with the opportunity to\r\n\r\ndevelop  his  or her potential to the fullest.  We  have  cut\r\n\r\ndown our school dropout rate.  So it shocked me to learn that\r\n\r\neach  year  some 1,500 children, or 3% of a cohort,  are  not\r\n\r\neven  registered  for Primary One in national  schools.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education has argued against compulsory education\r\n\r\nbecause  the number of non-registration is considered  small.\r\n\r\nBut  every Singaporean matters.  And every Singaporean  child\r\n\r\nshould  be  given the same head start in life, ie, to  attend\r\n\r\nschool.  I favour compulsory education,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat least up to Primary 4 level.  Beyond that, if a child does\r\n\r\nnot  want to study, or wants to drop out, there is little  we\r\n\r\ncan  do.   I am asking the Ministry of Education to  consider\r\n\r\nthe introduction of compulsory education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Giving Singaporeans an emotional stake</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have given Singaporeans a physical stake in the\r\n\r\ncountry - home-ownership, upgrading of HDB estates, shares of\r\n\r\nprivatised Government companies, cash top-up of their CPF and\r\n\r\nMedisave  accounts, good infrastructure and ample  facilities\r\n\r\nfor sports and leisure activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must now give Singaporeans an emotional stake in the\r\n\r\ncountry.    This   is  why  I  have  made  consultation   and\r\n\r\nparticipation one of the Government's major goals.  It is  to\r\n\r\ngive  Singaporeans a bigger say in their own future, and thus\r\n\r\nbond them to Singapore.  We want Singaporeans to sprout ideas\r\n\r\nto make Singapore better, take responsibility for their ideas\r\n\r\nand make them work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has successfully tapped private sector\r\n\r\nexpertise  for major Government-led committees  such  as  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  on  Singapore's Competitiveness of  1997  and  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Sector  Review Committee of 1998.   We  found  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  involvement very useful, both  in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncoming  to  grips with the problem and of forging a consensus\r\n\r\non  the way forward.  We will continue to involve the private\r\n\r\nsector  in  major review of important policies, not  just  in\r\n\r\neconomics, but also in non-economic areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have systematically opened up more\r\n\r\nchannels  for  citizens to participate, to  involve  them  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  a world-class home.  Besides writing to the  press,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  can  channel their views through  the  Feedback\r\n\r\nUnit,  Service Improvement Unit, Institute of Policy Studies,\r\n\r\nMembers of Parliament, dialogue sessions, GPC resource panels\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently-completed Singapore 21 exercise was\r\n\r\nnoteworthy for its involvement of Singaporeans from all walks\r\n\r\nof  life, in particular, younger Singaporeans.  Their  vision\r\n\r\nand  recommendations are now accepted as  national  policies.\r\n\r\nDue  to such extensive and active participation, we were able\r\n\r\nto  come  up with a Singapore 21 vision which fully reflected\r\n\r\nthe  needs and aspirations of our people.  The opposition may\r\n\r\ndismiss Singapore 21 as empty elections talk.  The point  is,\r\n\r\nit   is  a  collective  product  of  Singaporeans,  and   the\r\n\r\nopposition has nothing fresh to offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon Tay expressed his disappointment that the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address  and Addenda fell short  on  details  on\r\n\r\nfostering  an  active citizenry.  If the Government  were  to\r\n\r\nspell  out each and every step, or a series of bangs,  as  he\r\n\r\nput it, then it is contrary to what active citizenship is all\r\n\r\nabout and what we are trying to do, that is, more initiatives\r\n\r\nfrom the people sector.  Ravindran has answered this question\r\n\r\nvery well - that you want spontaneity from the people sector.\r\n\r\nWhat Simon Tay and Zulkifli are doing is right, that is, do a\r\n\r\nstudy  on  how to foster civil society and submit it  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and then we take it from there.  This is  what  I\r\n\r\nmean  by active citizenry.  You take the initiative, and  not\r\n\r\nexpect  the Government to outline the steps all the  way  for\r\n\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Turning Singapore into a nation of ideas</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, thousands of Singaporeans submit their\r\n\r\nsuggestions and views to the Feedback Unit.  In 1997, we took\r\n\r\nthe  feedback process further by organising regular  feedback\r\n\r\ncontributors  into groups.  So far, 27 feedback  groups  have\r\n\r\nbeen  formed.   These feedback units are the people  sector's\r\n\r\nequivalent of Quality Circles and Work Improvement Teams.  We\r\n\r\nnow  want  to go beyond feedback on how policies  affect  the\r\n\r\npeople  to  encouraging Singaporeans to  submit  constructive\r\n\r\nsuggestions and new ideas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Civil Service, we reward Work Improvement Teams\r\n\r\nwhen they submit cost-saving ideas.  Singaporeans may wish to\r\n\r\nform themselves into similar work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimprovement   teams  to  submit  ideas  on  any   aspect   of\r\n\r\ngovernment.   We  will  introduce an  award  scheme  to  give\r\n\r\nsymbolic recognition for useful ideas put up by Singaporeans,\r\n\r\neither  individually or as a team.  Big ideas or small ideas,\r\n\r\nlet them flow.  Turn Singapore into a nation of ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Consultation and Participation</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, let me explain what I expect of consultation and\r\n\r\nparticipation, to avoid misunderstanding and cynicism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, consultation does not mean that every Singaporean\r\n\r\nmust  be  consulted, or that every policy discussed with  the\r\n\r\npublic before it is implemented.  That is not practical.   If\r\n\r\nit  were  practical, you would not need Members of Parliament\r\n\r\nor  representative government.  Parliamentary democracy means\r\n\r\nelecting  a  group of Members of Parliament to represent  the\r\n\r\npeople's  interests.   The  Government  consults  the  people\r\n\r\nmainly through their MPs, and is answerable to Parliament for\r\n\r\nits  performance.   That  is why  having  good  MPs  who  can\r\n\r\nunderstand the concerns and solve problems for the people  is\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, when the Government consults, it is with people\r\n\r\nwho  have good knowledge of the subject.  It consults  people\r\n\r\nwho  can help improve the formulation of policies.  It is not\r\n\r\nnecessarily  with people who may be affected by  the  policy.\r\n\r\nEvery  policy of the Government affects the whole population.\r\n\r\nNo government consults its citizens on every policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Singaporeans must not expect every suggestion and\r\n\r\nidea of theirs to be accepted.  If a proposal is well argued,\r\n\r\nit  will get a fair hearing.  Even if it is rejected,  it  is\r\n\r\nalso  valuable if it has challenged existing assumptions  and\r\n\r\nthinking  and provided the opportunity for the Government  to\r\n\r\nreaffirm its policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, while Singaporeans will have more space for\r\n\r\npolitical  debate,  it does not mean that the  Government  is\r\n\r\nvacating the arena.  Anyone who wants a policy changed, or to\r\n\r\nset the national agenda,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  expect a debate with the Government.  Every  Government\r\n\r\npolicy  has  been carefully considered before implementation.\r\n\r\nBut  anyone is free to challenge it.  However, he must expect\r\n\r\na  response from the Government.  The Government will  defend\r\n\r\nits  policies, principles and programmes openly and robustly.\r\n\r\nNot  to  do  so  is contrary to the whole purpose  of  public\r\n\r\ndebate.  If the Government remains silent, views contrary  to\r\n\r\nwhat  the  Government believes is right, will  soon  prevail.\r\n\r\nThis will confuse the ground because the public may think the\r\n\r\nGovernment, by its silence, agrees with the contrary views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zulkifli Baharudin said that \"being thick-skinned must\r\n\r\ncertainly  be one of the necessary pre-requisites for  anyone\r\n\r\nintending  to engage in public debate\".  No, we do  not  want\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to develop hides.  Even the thickest hide can be\r\n\r\nstripped.   We do not want a querulous population with  thick\r\n\r\nskins.   An  important pre-requisite for public debate  is  a\r\n\r\nkeen  mind  -  how sound an idea is, and how it will  benefit\r\n\r\npublic interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that those without mischievous intention or a\r\n\r\nhidden agenda need not fear a rebuttal from Government.  They\r\n\r\nshould   not  be  discouraged  to  speak  up  simply  because\r\n\r\nGovernment may challenge their views.  Constructive debate is\r\n\r\na  necessary part of the process for determining what is best\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore.  This is what consultation and  participation\r\n\r\nis about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those out to undermine the Government, or to wrest\r\n\r\npower  from  the ruling party, is another matter  altogether.\r\n\r\nThey  must  expect a political response from the  Government.\r\n\r\nThis  political  response  can be  extremely  robust  because\r\n\r\nwhoever wins in the political arena will decide the future of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The PAP will guard its turf jealously,  not  for\r\n\r\nitself, but for the good of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will always be like a boat shooting the\r\n\r\nrapids.   Those  who  have  done  white-water  rafting  would\r\n\r\nunderstand  my analogy.  They will understand the  importance\r\n\r\nof the steersman as the boat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnegotiates  the rocks in a fast-flowing, frothy  river.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment is like this steersman or captain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experienced the thrills and dangers of white-water rafting in New Zealand. Once in the boat, I put my\r\n\r\nfaith  in  the  captain  and  do  what  he  told  me  to  do.\r\n\r\nConsultation took place before I stepped into the boat.  Once\r\n\r\nI was in, I had to play my part as a member of the crew.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not think that Singapore is sailing in calm waters\r\n\r\nand  therefore we can take risks.  Or that we  are  freer  to\r\n\r\nrock  the  boat because we now have a sturdier boat and  each\r\n\r\none of us is equipped with a safety helmet and a life jacket.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political landscape of our neighbours is changing.\r\n\r\nIt  will affect the strategic and security environment of our\r\n\r\nregion.   And  however  well-governed Singapore  is,  however\r\n\r\nstrong our economy is, and however united our people are,  we\r\n\r\nwill  be reminded from time to time that we are a little  red\r\n\r\ndot, or an adik, or a predominantly Chinese country within  a\r\n\r\nMuslim region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean we have to have a siege mentality.\r\n\r\nIt  means  we must be robust, forward-thinking and innovative\r\n\r\nto  break out of the confines of our geography, which is  why\r\n\r\nwe  are changing the way we teach in schools, and getting our\r\n\r\npeople to be more resourceful, creative and better informed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revamp of the education system will lead in the\r\n\r\nfuture to a questioning electorate.  A questioning electorate\r\n\r\nand   population  will  demand  a  higher  performance   from\r\n\r\nParliament and the Government.  It will demand more political\r\n\r\nspace, more debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will such a population throw up an alternative party to\r\n\r\nchallenge  the  PAP, or will it throw up more  good  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen  to join or support the PAP and help it carry  on  with\r\n\r\nits work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it matter so long as it produces a group of leaders\r\n\r\nwho are honest,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommitted  to  Singapore  and more  competent  than  the  PAP\r\n\r\nleaders?   Does  it  matter  if  it  is  a  population  which\r\n\r\nunderstands  Singapore's uniqueness and  vulnerabilities  and\r\n\r\nbacks its leaders?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do know that to survive in an intensely\r\n\r\ncompetitive borderless and volatile world, it does matter  if\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  have  a  well-informed,  thinking,  resourceful,\r\n\r\ninnovative and cohesive population with the resolve  to  keep\r\n\r\nSingapore going.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why for the remaining term of this Parliament,\r\n\r\nwe  are  emphasising  people - numbers, quality,  commitment,\r\n\r\nrelationships, roots, responsibility, freedom,  participation\r\n\r\nand  passion.  But more than talking and consultation,  there\r\n\r\nmust  be  action.   This is where I salute the  thousands  of\r\n\r\nsocial workers, volunteers, grassroots leaders and others who\r\n\r\ndo  more than talk.  They go about quietly, looking after the\r\n\r\ninterests  of their community and fellow Singaporeans.   They\r\n\r\nare  a  critical  part of our people sector.  The  Government\r\n\r\nvalues such people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans, especially the younger generation, must\r\n\r\nbelieve  firmly in what Singapore stands for  -  our  ideals,\r\n\r\nethos, principles and values, and be willing to do their part\r\n\r\nto  safeguard our way of life.  They have done well  in  life\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Singapore system offers them  a  level  playing\r\n\r\nfield,  abundant opportunities, and a helping hand to develop\r\n\r\ntheir  potential to the fullest.  Singapore's  future  is  in\r\n\r\ntheir hands.  They have to make a difference to Singapore and\r\n\r\nmake  us  proud  to  be Singaporeans.  This  is  what  active\r\n\r\ncitizenry is about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our hearts beat together for Singapore, we will\r\n\r\nsucceed  as  a  nation no matter what challenges  lie  ahead.\r\n\r\n[Applause.]\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  full-hearted support of this motion and  thank  the\r\n\r\nPresident for his timely pronouncement\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat  people will be the focus of the Government's policy  in\r\n\r\nthe new millennium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been so much debate, just a few minutes\r\n\r\nago  with  PM's  discourse  and in  the  last  two  years  on\r\n\r\nSingapore 21, in particular on how the State must create more\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  every  citizen to  contribute  ideas  and\r\n\r\nactions to be active citizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has implicitly accepted, I presume, that\r\n\r\nthe relationship between the State and society need not be  a\r\n\r\n\"flight  or fight\" choice for Singaporeans.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who are critical of certain policies  need  not\r\n\r\neither  totally  disengage  -  take  \"flight\"  so  to  speak,\r\n\r\nphysically  through  migration  or  psychologically   through\r\n\r\n\"tuning  out\" - from public discourse, or \"fight\"  by  taking\r\n\r\npart  in  partisan  politics.  If they do not  want  to  take\r\n\r\n\"flight\" or \"fight\", is there a third way?  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nthink  so  because I clearly do not believe that the  options\r\n\r\nbefore  us are dichotomous: that active citizenship is  about\r\n\r\nwhether you join the Government or against it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, in the last two years, has been far more\r\n\r\nrespectful  of different viewpoints and took them  seriously.\r\n\r\nA  process  of  engagement between the State and  the  people\r\n\r\nsector,  however unclear it is still in terms of  rights  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities,  has  begun.  Nevertheless,  we  are  still\r\n\r\nstruggling  and  will continue to do so with  regard  to  the\r\n\r\namount  of  space  the  Government is prepared  to  give  its\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to cite for discussion the case of\r\n\r\nChinese  High  students who organised a  spontaneous  signing\r\n\r\npetition   to   request  their  Principal  to  consider   his\r\n\r\nretirement,  which,  to  me, was  a  seemingly  peaceful  and\r\n\r\nheartfelt gesture that was absent of any ill intention.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry made a public statement that students must stay  off\r\n\r\nstaff matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I share the Ministry's concern that well-meaning and\r\n\r\nidealistic  students may be made use of  for  purposes  which\r\n\r\nstudents only vaguely understood.  But, Sir, for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfuture  references, who, how and by what standards  shall  we\r\n\r\njudge  when  to  put  a curb on student's civic  involvement?\r\n\r\nShould   we,   as   adults,   let   them   take   their   own\r\n\r\nresponsibilities  as  thinking  individuals,  by  adopting  a\r\n\r\ngreater  latitude of tolerance, even for acts which they  did\r\n\r\nnot  always  understand completely?  Sir, children  learn  by\r\n\r\nmaking  mistakes in doing things.  While this may be  frowned\r\n\r\nupon  in  our society, in our strive to create a zero  defect\r\n\r\nand  zero  mistake society, we have to accept that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nnatural human limitation to make mistakes.  That being so, is\r\n\r\nit  not  then  the  responsibility  of  the  adults  and  the\r\n\r\nauthorities to create that climate of tolerance for  learning\r\n\r\npurposes?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one student alumni from Chinese High said to me,\r\n\r\n\"if  we  do not first learn to bond with the school  and  our\r\n\r\nPrincipal,  how can we learn to bond with the  nation?\"   The\r\n\r\nChinese High students appreciated what the Principal had done\r\n\r\nfor the school and wanted him to stay, an emotion that seemed\r\n\r\nnatural  enough.   They would have liked  to  hear  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  that this was a good thing to do too.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nmade  them  feel as though they could not act  on  their  own\r\n\r\nwithout being easily manipulated.  Although the Ministry  did\r\n\r\nsay  it  was  understandable for students  to  express  their\r\n\r\nfeelings  in  a  press release issued by  Mrs  Lim  Soon  Tze\r\n\r\nafterwards, the students nevertheless felt let down.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are talking about future leaders of Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  expect them to think and make mistakes.  Even if they had\r\n\r\nbeen influenced by the Board members whose involvement in the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of  the  school  was inappropriate,  we  have  to\r\n\r\nrespect the students for reaching a decision to do what  they\r\n\r\ndid.  Then it is our job to persuade them otherwise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I bring this up as a concerned mother because apart\r\n\r\nfrom  academic achievement, I would like my children  to  get\r\n\r\nleadership   experiences   from  their   schools   on   civic\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  But I would also be disturbed  if  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  they were being used.  In this particular case,  I  ask\r\n\r\nwhat rights were the students asking\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor?  Nothing for themselves, it was simply an expression  of\r\n\r\naffection and hope that the Ministry will help them to retain\r\n\r\ntheir Principal.  What was the responsibility which they must\r\n\r\nreciprocate   to get this right of expression,  if  we  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Davinder Singh that there cannot be greater  rights\r\n\r\nwithout  greater responsibilities?  I assume in this case  is\r\n\r\nto  conduct  the act in a peaceful manner, without disruption\r\n\r\nto  school  routine and order.  That they had done  too.   So\r\n\r\nwhat did the students do wrong?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If students do not care about anything, they are accused\r\n\r\nof being apathetic.  If they express strong feelings about  a\r\n\r\nsubject  which, one has to admit, they certainly  have  first\r\n\r\nhand  feelings about, and act, as PM encourages people should\r\n\r\ndo  so,  they  are accused of being gullible  and  naive  and\r\n\r\nmanipulated  by  others.  Is this not  the  classic  catch-22\r\n\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it not wiser then to consider a leadership style of\r\n\r\nstepping back a little and \"letting it be\" (remember the song\r\n\r\n\"Let it be\" in the words of a famous baby-boomer rock singer)\r\n\r\n-  a  strategy of diffusing conflict and gaining some headway\r\n\r\nin  a  difficult situation?  In Chinese, we say \"yi  tui  wei\r\n\r\njin\" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Is it not better that\r\n\r\na  separate  session  be spent with the entire  Chinese  High\r\n\r\nSchool to commend the students for what they have done,  then\r\n\r\nexplain  clearly  but gently that this is  an  administrative\r\n\r\nmatter  which  is  best  settled  officially?   I  think  the\r\n\r\nstudents will totally agree with you because most of them did\r\n\r\nnot  see their act as intervening in staff matters, even less\r\n\r\na  \"wish  to join the picket line of employment disputes\"  as\r\n\r\nfeared by Mr Loh Meng See.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry may be right to chastise the Board members\r\n\r\nwho  should  know  better, but it must handle  the  students'\r\n\r\nemotions separately by attempting to earn their understanding\r\n\r\nthrough  facilitative  communication  and  persuasion.   Such\r\n\r\nopenness  from  the Ministry including a little  risk  taking\r\n\r\ninitiative  on  its  part will go a  long  way  in  nurturing\r\n\r\nteenagers to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbecoming  self-empowered adults.  We  do  not  learn  lateral\r\n\r\nthinking  by doing De Bono classes; it is by doing activities\r\n\r\nwith people and learning from all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree that active citizenship encapsulates a\r\n\r\nbargain,  but in any bargain, it involves two way risk-taking\r\n\r\nand  resolution  process  being adopted  by  the  parties  in\r\n\r\nnegotiation.  If only one party dictates the terms, it is not\r\n\r\na  bargain;  it is an authoritarian imposition.   I  hope  Mr\r\n\r\nSimon  Tay  and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin will use  the  case  of\r\n\r\nChinese High School as their study on civil society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a separate encouraging note, in my own experiences as\r\n\r\nan   advocate  in  the  community,  I  have  been  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  persuade policy makers and be  persuaded  to\r\n\r\ngive  feedback  to  certain Ministries and be  corrected  and\r\n\r\neducated in return.  I have to register my gratitude here  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries of Community Development and Home Affairs for\r\n\r\nopening  their doors to me and the groups which I represented\r\n\r\nin  these  10 years.  In our constructive engagement process,\r\n\r\nwe  have collaborated on many projects together.  I hope  all\r\n\r\nthe  Ministries will continue to open up more, to  a  broader\r\n\r\nrange  of  people in small group meetings to  gather  diverse\r\n\r\nviewpoints, or even radically different ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process of engaging the people sector is clearly\r\n\r\nwhat  I  am  focusing  on, because in  the  process,  we  are\r\n\r\nconstructing  the  norms  and values  on  how  to  do  things\r\n\r\ntogether and how to negotiate differences.  Mr Ravindran  has\r\n\r\neloquently  talked  about  what civil  society  is  not,  how\r\n\r\nelusive  it  is  and the dangers ahead.  It  is  an  evolving\r\n\r\nprocess  of definition.  I do not think Mr Simon  Tay  or  Mr\r\n\r\nZulkifli  Baharudin  will  find  the  definition.   It  is  a\r\n\r\ncollective process that we all here in this House must reach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I simply ask at this point for an engagement. In this\r\n\r\nengagement, we learn to give and take.  We learn what can  be\r\n\r\nnegotiated  and attempted.  If no resolution can be  reached,\r\n\r\nwe  learn  how  to put the matter at hand aside  for  further\r\n\r\nreview and wait for another round of discussion,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalways with an open mind and willingness to give the issue  a\r\n\r\nfresh  look.   Never  mind  in the end  whose  proposals  got\r\n\r\naccepted,   rejected  or  amended  -  the   time   spent   in\r\n\r\nconstructive  engagement  is  the  humanising  dimension   of\r\n\r\nparticipatory  democracy.   If the Government  only  consults\r\n\r\nthose people who can help it formulate policy, ie, the highly\r\n\r\neducated individuals, then it will fail to reach and feel the\r\n\r\ncommunity.  Civil servants, MPs and community leaders must do\r\n\r\ntheir  part.  And I hope all Members of Parliament will  take\r\n\r\nthis seriously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The road map with clear pointers and markers\" asked by\r\n\r\nMr  Davinder Singh cannot be established overnight.  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Prof.  Toh See Kiat that disagreement is not  division.\r\n\r\nBut  when  there are disagreements, it is important  that  we\r\n\r\nkeep  an  open mind to review the issues and reach  a  middle\r\n\r\nground.  Too many disagreements will lead to division.   With\r\n\r\nsufficient   time  and  opportunity  given  to   relationship\r\n\r\nbuilding between the Government and society, we are closer to\r\n\r\nknowing  how  \"to  take the heat\" as Mr  Davinder  said,  and\r\n\r\nidentify what Singaporeans truly want which cannot be assumed\r\n\r\nto  be homogenous, as Mr Sin Boon Ann cautioned.  The process\r\n\r\nof  engagement does help, I believe, to restore the emotional\r\n\r\nbonding  that  Mr Inderjit Singh hopes for, the  loyalty  and\r\n\r\npatriotism  that Mr Kenneth Chen wishes for in  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nand  the  trust  that Mr Zainul Abidin finds essential  in  a\r\n\r\npluralistic society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people have to act, not just pontificate or\r\n\r\nponder  like what Mr Iswaran said.  I would quickly add  that\r\n\r\nthe  Government too has to roll up its sleeves and  act  with\r\n\r\nthe   people.   It  is  evidently  in  the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to say \"Trust me\".  But it has to meet the  demand\r\n\r\nof  the voters who yell \"Show me.\"  Between this tension,  it\r\n\r\nis a whole lot of effort and sincerity that must be poured in\r\n\r\nfrom  the  State and the people sector.  It is easy  to  shut\r\n\r\npeople  up  with  robust sanctions, but what  do  we  get  in\r\n\r\nreturn?    Demoralisation,   indifference,   escapism,    low\r\n\r\nvoluntarism, low motivation - all the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nattributes  which  kill creativity.  Thick-skinnedness  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessary trait.  I agree with Mr Zulkifli Baharudin, but let\r\n\r\nus  not  forget that the skin gets thicker only with age  and\r\n\r\nexperience, not everyone gets there yet.  It is up  to  those\r\n\r\nin authority to step back sometimes and let it be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the space to express and create, we slowly kill\r\n\r\npeople's  imagination.   Let me quote  what  Albert  Einstein\r\n\r\nsaid:  \"In  moments  of  crisis,  only  imagination  is  more\r\n\r\nvaluable  than knowledge.\"  Has the Government  provided  the\r\n\r\npeople  with an environment to imagine and create, to  better\r\n\r\nface up to any crisis in the unpredictable times ahead, which\r\n\r\nPM just a few minutes ago warned us?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to switch gear and look at broader\r\n\r\nissues.  The Government has said that developing heartware in\r\n\r\nour society is top priority.  Arising from this commitment, I\r\n\r\npropose greater attention to four areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The need for a broader definition of success beyond\r\n\r\njust  material criteria so that we can tap the  diversity  of\r\n\r\ntalents  within our people.  To begin with, I would like  all\r\n\r\nschools  and  all  learning institutions to develop  a  wider\r\n\r\nrange  of  curriculum components to cater  to  students  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  intelligence and talents.  The  future  demands  a\r\n\r\nmulti-disciplinary  approach  to  problem-solving,  the  more\r\n\r\nflexibility  there is in subject mix as well as teaching  and\r\n\r\nlearning  methodologies, the more prepared  Singapore  is  in\r\n\r\nproducing  the kind of adults who are dynamic and  adaptable.\r\n\r\nI  am  glad to hear from the Minister for Education yesterday\r\n\r\nthat  his  Ministry  is  reviewing the teaching  methods  and\r\n\r\nteachers' quality at the pre-school level and I am so glad to\r\n\r\nhear PM's call earlier for compulsory education up to Primary\r\n\r\n4   level.   I  believe  that  learning  challenges  at   the\r\n\r\nsecondary, primary and pre-school levels are very important.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The need to address the social divide between those\r\n\r\nwho  possess the competencies and connections to make  it  in\r\n\r\nthe   knowledge-based  economy  and  those  who  cannot,   by\r\n\r\nincreasing the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nawareness  of  the \"haves\" regarding the needs of  the  \"have\r\n\r\nnots\".   I  attended  a seminar organised  by  the  AMP  last\r\n\r\nweekend.  They  highlighted rising social  problems,  divorce\r\n\r\nrates, increasing family violence, increasing teenage crimes,\r\n\r\nhigh  drug  recidivism, low morale and motivation  among  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged families. These are not the issues of  a  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity alone. These concern all of us as Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Zainul Abidin who said in his speech\r\n\r\nthat we cannot take multi-culturalism for granted, and it  is\r\n\r\nno  longer sufficient for different ethnic groups to just co-exist.  We  need  to  enhance their mutual understanding  and\r\n\r\ntrust  for one another, not by institutionalising one  Multi-Cultural  Day,  but more by getting different  groups  to  do\r\n\r\nprojects  and programmes together.  And here, I am responding\r\n\r\nto the call to act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose a buddy programme in schools to encourage\r\n\r\ncross-cultural  interaction by pairing  up  different  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  to study together, even stay with one another  for  a\r\n\r\nfew  days.   At  another  level,  we  can  also  think  about\r\n\r\n\"shadowing\"  programmes  for schools to  encourage  different\r\n\r\nethnic groups to pair up and shadow a CEO or manager at  work\r\n\r\nin  the public and private sectors for one week, three  days,\r\n\r\nor  even  one  day.  I had volunteered our company  for  this\r\n\r\nprogramme initiated by Raffles Girls' Secondary School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that such a programme helps to restore in our\r\n\r\nyoung  a  certain  degree  of realism  about  work,  and  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  teamwork and mutual support, all  the  values\r\n\r\nwhich  are extremely important in cross-cultural relationship\r\n\r\nbuilding.   I  am  confident that this programme  would  reap\r\n\r\npositive benefits in the case of teenage boys \"at the  edge\",\r\n\r\nwhose   restlessness   could  steer  them   towards   deviant\r\n\r\nactivities if unharnessed, but could yield productive outcome\r\n\r\nif captured and properly channelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are just a few examples for me to illustrate\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  new  ways  of motivating  our  teenagers  and\r\n\r\nenhancing cross-cultural understanding. We cannot talk  about\r\n\r\nracial  harmony.   We  must actively work  at  it  with  good\r\n\r\nprogrammes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the need to create a separate, distinct Youth 21\r\n\r\nprogramme  similar  to  the S21 programme,  so  that  we  can\r\n\r\nspecifically  tackle  the  hopes  and  fears  of  our   young\r\n\r\ngeneration.  The under-25 generation today will dominate  the\r\n\r\nnew  millennium.  If they feel bored, irrelevant and  trapped\r\n\r\nin  their own homeland, Singapore will be the poorer for  it.\r\n\r\nIf  they  migrate,  we  are in a worse  shape.   As  PM  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  we  are not replacing ourselves, therefore  keeping\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean is a priority concern.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose more resources to be given to the National\r\n\r\nYouth   Council  and  community  agencies  to  create  \"youth\r\n\r\ncentres\", as Dr Tan Boon Wan talked about yesterday,  to  let\r\n\r\nthem meet regularly and identify clearly what teenagers want,\r\n\r\nwhat  we  can do to meet these expectations and  how  we  can\r\n\r\nshape their community responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last is the need to look at family values and\r\n\r\nincreasing  gender conflicts, and restore a sense  of  family\r\n\r\nequilibrium that we have lost in the last few decades in  our\r\n\r\nincessant  search for material wealth, at both  the  personal\r\n\r\nand  national level.  In the larger perspective, families are\r\n\r\nstill strong, but it serves us well to find out why the bonds\r\n\r\nare weakening, how women and men can be helped in coping with\r\n\r\ntheir  changing roles and where the fault lines are  and  why\r\n\r\n1,000 women left Singapore and married foreigners.  This is a\r\n\r\nserious problem for the sons of the MPs in this House today!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the discussion of the impact of a knowledge-based\r\n\r\neconomy  on  society, what new policies can  be  designed  to\r\n\r\nenable  families,  not  just workers,  to  become  \"knowledge\r\n\r\nfamilies\",  able  to  transmit the kind  of  information  and\r\n\r\nvalues to the children to make them learn well and willing to\r\n\r\nserve  the community with pride. I support Dr Jennifer  Lee's\r\n\r\ncall\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor   identifying  more  pro-family  work  policies  and  job\r\n\r\nredesigns  to  help  working couples in  balancing  work  and\r\n\r\nfamily responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end with an endorsement of the view\r\n\r\nthat  we  need more centres of prestige to be created  within\r\n\r\nour  society.  More functions should feature guests-of-honour\r\n\r\nwho  are  not  Ministers and MPs, but other  leaders  of  our\r\n\r\ncommunity  in  their chosen fields.  I feel  this  effort  in\r\n\r\ncreating  horizontal connections of influence to include  not\r\n\r\njust  politicians and civil servants, but credible  champions\r\n\r\nin  the  people  sector,  be it in the  industry,  the  arts,\r\n\r\neducation,  social services, and so forth, will  add  healthy\r\n\r\ndiversity and new leadership to public events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers have said that they intend to support\r\n\r\nthis  by  covering  not just ministerial functions,  but  all\r\n\r\nkinds   of   people  functions,  even  if  no   Minister   is\r\n\r\nofficiating. This is a good start of powering people to be on\r\n\r\nthe  front-line  to lead and influence.  May I  even  propose\r\n\r\nthat  one of the two newspapers that SPH is going to  publish\r\n\r\nbe   called   the  \"The  Unofficial  News\"  and  contain   no\r\n\r\npronouncements from officialdom.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to power the imagination, the idealism and\r\n\r\nthe hopes of all Singaporeans.  If the Government delivers  a\r\n\r\nleadership  style  with the same measure  of  creativity  and\r\n\r\ninnovation which it expects of Singaporeans, we are closer to\r\n\r\nbuilding  the  people  power  for  a  better  millennium  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members before me have spoken on the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Speech, touching on the Government's  commitment\r\n\r\nto the Singapore 21 Vision and its focus and at this juncture\r\n\r\nof  this  debate, I would just like to touch on those aspects\r\n\r\nof  the President's Speech which serve to focus our minds  on\r\n\r\nmany post-crisis concerns of today.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a country, we have withstood the economic crisis of\r\n\r\nthe  past  two years which was described as one of  our  most\r\n\r\nsevere  economic  tests since independence and  are  emerging\r\n\r\nrelatively  unscathed in general compared to other  countries\r\n\r\nin  the  region.  But before we give ourselves a pat  on  the\r\n\r\nback,  congratulate each other for a job well-done and become\r\n\r\ncomplacent in believing that what needs to be done  has  been\r\n\r\ndone,  we  should  examine how the crisis  has  affected  the\r\n\r\ndifferent segments of our population and how we are  handling\r\n\r\nthe challenges ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should ask ourselves whether the same measures that\r\n\r\nwe  took  to survive the crisis have weakened or will  weaken\r\n\r\nour  social  fabric and our social cohesion in the long-term,\r\n\r\nand  if so, what must be done to avoid such consequence.  How\r\n\r\nthe impact of the economic crisis is felt differs from people\r\n\r\nto  people, person to person, family to family. For some,  it\r\n\r\nwas  just  like sitting through a horror movie.  Although  it\r\n\r\nwas  frightening  while  it lasted, they  were  watching  the\r\n\r\nevents  as if from a distance, as an observer.  And now  that\r\n\r\nit is behind us, they let out a sigh of relief and say, \"Boy,\r\n\r\nthat  was  scary.  Good thing we were not that badly affected\r\n\r\nand emerged basically intact.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monetary value of their property, their shares and\r\n\r\ntheir  assets is now back to pre-crisis levels and they  have\r\n\r\nmanaged to maintain their source and level of income.   There\r\n\r\nis  no  denying that the last two years were valuable lessons\r\n\r\nbut  they are history now and we move on.  But there are also\r\n\r\nmany  others among us who have literally lost their pants  in\r\n\r\nthe  crisis.   They  lost  their jobs,  ran  up  huge  debts,\r\n\r\ncompelled to sell their assets, their homes were foresold and\r\n\r\nsome  were  even made bankrupt. Even today, when the  general\r\n\r\nconsensus is that the economy is picking up, mortgagee  sales\r\n\r\nof private homes are still happening.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people went through the crisis differently and\r\n\r\nare  now  assessing their future from different perspectives.\r\n\r\nI  felt  this  when  I  told my constituents  the  crisis  is\r\n\r\nreceding and we are emerging stronger\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthan before.  They were not unanimous in agreement. Some  did\r\n\r\nnot  agree  wholeheartedly with this observation because  the\r\n\r\ncrisis  and the structural changes and restructuring that  it\r\n\r\nbrought  about had impacted them adversely and in a  profound\r\n\r\nmanner, and they are now worse off than before.  This  crisis\r\n\r\nhas  brought about many fundamental structural changes to our\r\n\r\neconomy.  Certain skills that were valuable in the  past  are\r\n\r\nnow  no  longer  needed.  Some of the  old  wealth  has  been\r\n\r\neroded,  even dissipated, while new wealth has been  created.\r\n\r\nIf you are not careful, this will result in a widening of the\r\n\r\ndisparity  between at the one end, those who are  well-placed\r\n\r\nto  tap  into  and  take  advantage of the  new  restructured\r\n\r\neconomic  environment and, at the other end,  those  who  are\r\n\r\nstill  struggling  to  find their feet and  whose  skills  no\r\n\r\nlonger command the same value as they are being offered by  a\r\n\r\nmultitude  of others who are prepared to accept lower  wages.\r\n\r\nIf  this  issue  is not effectively dealt with,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndanger  that those who feel deprived and left out will become\r\n\r\nalienated  and resentful.  I am therefore heartened  to  hear\r\n\r\nthe  President's  note of caution that the  new  restructured\r\n\r\neconomy must not widen the gap between those who sprint ahead\r\n\r\nwith  the  new technologies and those who struggle to  master\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has all along pursued policies to\r\n\r\nenhance the cohesion of our society where even while the able\r\n\r\nis called upon to lead in the growth of the economy, the rest\r\n\r\nof  the  population is not deprived of the  rewards  but  has\r\n\r\nenjoyed  a share in our economic growth.  Since independence,\r\n\r\nSingapore  has achieved remarkable success. For  decades,  we\r\n\r\nhave  sustained one of the fastest growing economies  in  the\r\n\r\nworld,  while  maintaining  low  inflation,  virtually   full\r\n\r\nemployment  since 1973, and a steady rise in real income  and\r\n\r\nstandard  of living of Singaporeans as a whole.  Unlike  some\r\n\r\ndeveloping countries, this overall increase in income has not\r\n\r\nbeen  confined to a privileged minority but is enjoyed  by  a\r\n\r\nbroad section of the population.  Over the years,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthere  has  been a reduction of poverty and income disparity.\r\n\r\nThis  is  because we have not pursued policies favouring  the\r\n\r\nrich at the expense of the middle and lower classes.  No  one\r\n\r\nshould  accuse  our Government of doing little  to  help  the\r\n\r\nlower income group get out of the rut.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental principles that we have adopted to\r\n\r\norganise  our  society have helped to  ensure  that  any  gap\r\n\r\nbetween  the  various  segments of the  population  does  not\r\n\r\nbecome unmanageable.  Many people would agree that the gap at\r\n\r\npresent  is small.  I found a recent example of this  in  the\r\n\r\nreaction   and   our   Prime   Minister   using   the   terms\r\n\r\n\"cosmopolitans\" and \"heartlanders\". Many people  I  spoke  to\r\n\r\nfelt  that there was not a clear distinction between the  two\r\n\r\ngroups.    They  felt  that  they  could  quite   easily   be\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan at times and a heartlander at other times.   But\r\n\r\nthat  is  in  terms of outward behaviour.   While  our  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  spoke about the difference in outlook,  orientation\r\n\r\nand   interests,  nevertheless,  in  Singapore,   a   typical\r\n\r\ncosmopolitan can be very comfortable, behaving outwardly as a\r\n\r\nheartlander  at  times,  and  doing  things  heartlanders  do\r\n\r\nbecause  of the deliberate efforts of the Government  over  a\r\n\r\nlong period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the years, many of our Government programmes\r\n\r\nhave  brought  along  a  narrowing  of  the  differences   in\r\n\r\nstandards  of  living  and quality of life  in  the  material\r\n\r\nsense. For example, our campaigns to keep Singapore clean, to\r\n\r\nflush  the  toilets,  to be courteous and  campaigns  against\r\n\r\nspitting and smoking have caused a change in the behaviour of\r\n\r\npeople  over  time.   And the norm is being  established  and\r\n\r\naccepted  by Singaporeans in general.  This has narrowed  any\r\n\r\ndifferences  in behaviour and averted a situation  where  one\r\n\r\nsocial  group  finds  the behaviour of another  social  group\r\n\r\ndespicable.   So,  most  hawker  centres  today  are  of   an\r\n\r\nacceptable standard.  But if this were not the case,  and  if\r\n\r\nhawker  centres are dirty and rat-infested,  and many  people\r\n\r\nthere  spit  on  the floor, some people would probably  avoid\r\n\r\nsuch  places  because they do not fit  into  the  idea  of  a\r\n\r\ndesirable place to enjoy\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na  meal.  This would then lead to a divide among Singaporeans\r\n\r\nbased on where they frequent to take their meals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our public housing and social amenities, the\r\n\r\nstandards have improved and the gap in the material sense  is\r\n\r\nnot  wide.  Amenities  built to  cater  to  the  public  have\r\n\r\nimproved in standard and even the rich do not shun them.  Our\r\n\r\nNTUC  supermarkets, wet markets, hawker centres, and national\r\n\r\nparks  are  frequented  by people from  all  walks  of  life.\r\n\r\nCosmopolitans are not shy to say that they do so.  This is an\r\n\r\nencouraging  sign  and we must continue  in  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\nnarrow  any gap in the quality of these facilities,  so  that\r\n\r\nthey  do  not  just  cater  to a particular  segment  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the basic principles are in place and without\r\n\r\nabandoning them, I believe more can be done in each of  these\r\n\r\nareas  to gel the people together to enhance social cohesion.\r\n\r\nWith  a  cohesive people supporting the Government   and  its\r\n\r\npolicies,  we can confront and tackle problems  head  on  and\r\n\r\npull  everyone  together to focus on the challenges  and  the\r\n\r\npossibilities that are ahead of us.  However, any measure  to\r\n\r\ndistribute  income more evenly must not stifle the  drive  to\r\n\r\nexcel,  but  must be balanced with other needs  of  retaining\r\n\r\ntalent  and  promoting economic growth.  We must continue  to\r\n\r\nmaintain  the  meritocratic society  of  equal  opportunities\r\n\r\nwhile,  at  the  same time, working together  to  narrow  any\r\n\r\neconomic   disparity   among  the   different   segments   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  In the process, we can cultivate  a  sense  of\r\n\r\nbelonging  and identity that is firmly grounded and resilient\r\n\r\nto weather any turbulence ahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for allowing me to participate in the debate.\r\n\r\nI rise to support the motion put forth by Mr Davinder Singh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the regional crisis has demonstrated yet again how\r\n\r\nprecarious Singapore, the island state, is in this developing\r\n\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nYes,  we are an independent nation, but totally dependent  on\r\n\r\nthe   health  and  the  well-being  of  the  region  and  the\r\n\r\ninternational  community  for  us  to  continue   to   be   a\r\n\r\nsignificant global player.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always demonstrated its wits and tenacity\r\n\r\nin  building  up  its  attractiveness as a  premier  business\r\n\r\ncentre   in   Asia   with   a  global   orientation.    Rapid\r\n\r\nglobalisation,  advancement in technology and  communications\r\n\r\nnow mean that we have to adapt our strategies to fit into the\r\n\r\nnew world order or be left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the various Ministries' recognition of meeting\r\n\r\nthe  global  challenge  by taking  the  bull  by  the  horns.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  the  quest to achieve and maintain  Singapore's\r\n\r\nedge as a premier Asian global city, we must ensure that  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  entrepreneurs  and  businessmen  are  not   left\r\n\r\nbehind.   Just  as  Singapore  has  grown  from  strength  to\r\n\r\nstrength,  the  small and medium local enterprises  of  today\r\n\r\ncould   be  the  multi-nationals  of  tomorrow.   As   global\r\n\r\ncompanies  locating  in  Singapore compete  for  the  limited\r\n\r\nresources we have, in particular the people resource, we must\r\n\r\nensure  that  Singapore  deliberately  supports  such   local\r\n\r\nenterprises  and  ventures through  more  liberal  programmes\r\n\r\nlike,  for  instance, funding assistance,  start-up  and  R&D\r\n\r\ngrants, training grants and maybe even a lower corporate  tax\r\n\r\nrate for such subsidies to be reinvested in the business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a host of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives\r\n\r\nfor  multi-nationals to avail themselves.  I understand  that\r\n\r\nthe qualifying rules are stringent to attract the appropriate\r\n\r\nplayers in the high growth and high value added areas,  which\r\n\r\nwill  enhance  Singapore's competitive  edge.   However,  the\r\n\r\nlocal SMEs should be identified as a group on its own with an\r\n\r\nappropriate development programme.  I am totally  in  support\r\n\r\nof  the Ministry of Trade and Industry's intention to nurture\r\n\r\na  hundred  promising local enterprises to become world-class\r\n\r\ncompanies by 2005.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of foreign talent, let me say that I\r\n\r\nam in broad agreement with the argument that in order to keep\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncompetitive  edge,  Singapore has to supplement  our  limited\r\n\r\ntalent  pool  by  attracting suitably skilled  and  qualified\r\n\r\nforeign  talent.  In this respect, I commend the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nManpower's  plans  to make Singapore an international  talent\r\n\r\ncity  and intellectual focal point where diverse talents from\r\n\r\nall over the world congregate and supplement our own talent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this policy is very much in keeping with\r\n\r\nthe   process  of  globalisation  sweeping  the  world.   The\r\n\r\ncommunications  and  information  technology  revolution   in\r\n\r\ntandem  with  the  emergence of a single global  economy  has\r\n\r\nproduced a new cosmopolitanism which is impossible to ignore.\r\n\r\nToday,  it  is not unusual to find a Taiwanese, for instance,\r\n\r\nstudying  in the United States, then find a job in Hong  Kong\r\n\r\nwhere he meets and marries a Canadian Chinese partner.   Even\r\n\r\ncloser  to home, when you watch CNN, it is impossible not  to\r\n\r\nbe  struck by the fact that the Asian presenters are speaking\r\n\r\nin American accented English.  In other words, the concept of\r\n\r\na   pure   unadulterated   national  identity   is   becoming\r\n\r\nincreasingly  untenable, given the impact of global  economic\r\n\r\nand  perhaps  even  cultural integration.  Singaporeans  must\r\n\r\nthus  accept  that we are increasingly global  citizens,  and\r\n\r\nthat   to  succeed  in  an  increasingly  sophisticated   and\r\n\r\ncompetitive  world, we need to be open to the idea  that  our\r\n\r\nfriends  from  overseas  can and must  play  a  role  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess.  In short, we should see them not as foreigners  but\r\n\r\nrather  as  fellow  global citizens who  have  joined  us  in\r\n\r\nhelping  us keep an international edge.  In fact, to  further\r\n\r\nenhance our competitive edge, I would like to suggest that we\r\n\r\nalso  try to tap into the other rather neglected talent pool,\r\n\r\nthe Singaporean professionals who have emigrated overseas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a large community of what I would like to\r\n\r\ncall  quasi  foreign  talent available  whose  resources  and\r\n\r\nskills  would  be  invaluable  to  our  economy.   The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has alluded to this group of Singaporeans and  given\r\n\r\nus  some  statistics.  From experience, I know that  many  of\r\n\r\nthese expatriate Singaporeans\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  former Singaporeans would like to return home  but  they\r\n\r\nare  dissuaded by the fact that they would have  to  give  up\r\n\r\ntheir  present overseas standard of living and cope with  the\r\n\r\nSingapore reality of high property and car prices, as well as\r\n\r\nin  their  perception, whether true or  not  is  an  entirely\r\n\r\nseparate  matter,  the  more regulated social  and  political\r\n\r\nenvironment.  However, if these former Singaporeans could  be\r\n\r\npersuaded  to  return,  their impact would  be  considerable.\r\n\r\nFor,  let  us  face  the facts, unlike foreigners  who  would\r\n\r\nprobably  work  for, say, five years before  returning  home,\r\n\r\nthese  former Singaporeans, after all, grew up here and their\r\n\r\nroots  are  here.  Their loyalty would be to  Singapore.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse, there will be those who argue that the very fact that\r\n\r\nthey   left  Singapore  in  the  first  place  is  proof   of\r\n\r\ndisloyalty, but that is a very parochial point of view.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in an open global economy, talent migrates to where\r\n\r\nit  can  earn  the  greatest returns.  Singapore,  which  has\r\n\r\nalways   believed  in  the  logic  of  free  and   unfettered\r\n\r\ncompetition,  recognises this.  Thus, the Singapore  way  has\r\n\r\nnever  been to brow beat our people into engaging in  certain\r\n\r\nbehaviour by loading them with guilt, but rather to  convince\r\n\r\nthem that it is in their interest that it makes perfect sense\r\n\r\nfor them to adopt that particular pattern of behaviour.  This\r\n\r\nhard  edge realism is precisely why we pay our civil servants\r\n\r\ngood  and competitive salaries, and why our civil service  is\r\n\r\nconsequently   world   famous   for   its   proficiency   and\r\n\r\nincorruptibility.  In this respect, if Singapore can  provide\r\n\r\nthese  quasi  foreign talents sufficient incentives,  whether\r\n\r\nmaterial or otherwise, and support and encouragement, we will\r\n\r\nindeed be hard to beat and will become an intellectual  focal\r\n\r\npoint  which  will be irresistible to our sons and  daughters\r\n\r\nwho  are  now  overseas.   I wonder whether  the  Government,\r\n\r\nthrough  its contacts with Singapore offices world-wide,  has\r\n\r\nany  plans  to try to attract this particular pool of  talent\r\n\r\nhome where they belong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, I note that the Ministry of Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  has  projected that the ageing  population  will\r\n\r\ntriple by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n2030  when  one in four citizens will be aged above  65.   In\r\n\r\nthis  connection,  I  am  happy with the  several  Government\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to  cope  with this development.   I  note  with\r\n\r\napproval   that   MCD  is  to  strengthen  public   education\r\n\r\nprogrammes  on  ageing  and,  in particular,  will  encourage\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to  value  their  elderly  as  a  resource  and\r\n\r\nactively harness their contributions.  I look forward to  the\r\n\r\nMCD's  masterplan for services to the elderly which  will  be\r\n\r\nready next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also applaud the Ministry of Health for recognising\r\n\r\nthe   increasingly  urgent  need  for  step-down  care,   and\r\n\r\nespecially  its  intention  to work  with  voluntary  welfare\r\n\r\norganisations  and  the  private sector  to  build  community\r\n\r\nhospitals  and nursing homes.  I fully agree with the  future\r\n\r\npolicy  to introduce an insurance scheme to defray  the  high\r\n\r\ncost  of long-term step-down care for the elderly who  suffer\r\n\r\nfrom disabilities.  And I think the idea of a means test  for\r\n\r\nall  step-down care services to allocate Government subsidies\r\n\r\nfor deserving cases is a sound one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased with the recent report that existing\r\n\r\nMRT  stations will be retrofitted with lifts and  ramps,  and\r\n\r\nthe  North East Line and the Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit\r\n\r\nSystem will also incorporate these elderly friendly features,\r\n\r\nand that the Government will pay for this to be done.  But  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that more can be done to meet the specific needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly,  eg,  will SMRT be willing,  for  instance,  to\r\n\r\ndesignate one carriage as an elderly only carriage?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRT aside, how will public buses be configured to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  usage by elderly folk, especially those  who  are\r\n\r\ndisabled?  The Minister for National Development, Mr Mah  Bow\r\n\r\nTan,  has said that bus operators will be left to decide  how\r\n\r\nto  make their buses more accessible to the old.  But bearing\r\n\r\nin   mind   that   they  are,  in  essence,   profit   driven\r\n\r\norganisations, how likely are they to put the convenience and\r\n\r\nwelfare of the elderly as a major concern?  Moreover,  is  it\r\n\r\npossible  to  introduce a system as in the UK  where  elderly\r\n\r\npeople  travel  on  public buses for free,  rather  than  the\r\n\r\npartial subsidy and limited travel\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\narrangement?   Sir,  I do hope that the  Ministry  will  give\r\n\r\nsufficient thought to these issues, especially if the elderly\r\n\r\nproportion of the commuting public increases and in the light\r\n\r\nof vehicle ownership policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Ministry of Manpower is looking into\r\n\r\nfine-tuning  the CPF system to ensure members  have  adequate\r\n\r\nsavings  to  meet old age needs and medical  care.   I  agree\r\n\r\nwholeheartedly  with  this review, as  CPF  funds  should  be\r\n\r\ninvested  wisely  and  not whittled away through  speculative\r\n\r\ntrades on the stock market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our elderly should be encouraged to retire with savings\r\n\r\nand dignity.  In this respect, I would like the Government to\r\n\r\nconsider   reinstating  the  tax  exemption  for   retirement\r\n\r\ngratuities,  as  was the case pre-1993.  This once-a-lifetime\r\n\r\ntax  exemption  would further provide for adequate  financial\r\n\r\nsecurity on retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the self-employed, I would also like to see\r\n\r\ncompulsory tax free CPF contributions beyond Medisave,  which\r\n\r\nwould  equate at least to the gross percentage which salaried\r\n\r\nemployees are accumulating in their CPF accounts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the issue of catering to the needs of\r\n\r\nthe  elderly,  I would like to stress the importance  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  factor,  part of the heartware we want  to  build  in\r\n\r\nensuring that the various schemes succeed in bringing about a\r\n\r\npopulation which ages graciously.  By the people factor, I am\r\n\r\nreferring  to  the attitudes of service providers  like,  for\r\n\r\nexample, bus and taxi drivers.  How many bus drivers actually\r\n\r\nwait  for  the elderly to see them safely before moving  off?\r\n\r\nAnd  very few taxi drivers actually help passengers  to  load\r\n\r\nand  unload  their shopping or luggage.  Will they constantly\r\n\r\ngo  the extra mile as a rule of thumb for the elderly?  I was\r\n\r\nalso  appalled to hear how a 90-year old lady in a wheelchair\r\n\r\nhad problems getting to a hospital and clinic appointment, as\r\n\r\nvery  few  taxi  drivers  are keen to ferry  the  wheel-chair\r\n\r\nbound.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that these are issues which have come up time\r\n\r\nand again, but unless\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  consciously change these attitudes they will not go away,\r\n\r\nand  even  the  best  infrastructure will  not  make  us  the\r\n\r\ngracious society we want to be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to make a few comments on\r\n\r\neducation.   I  believe that the MOE's emphasis  on  ability-driven education is the right one.  It is important to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  innate  talents and abilities of  each  particular\r\n\r\nchild  are identified, honed and harnessed not only  for  his\r\n\r\nown  optimal  personal development but also for higher  ends.\r\n\r\nIn  this respect, I commend MOE's focus on the five areas  of\r\n\r\nthe school environment  -  the curriculum development system,\r\n\r\nteacher  development, pre- and post-school  development,  and\r\n\r\ndeveloping Singapore as an education hub.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus particularly on curriculum and\r\n\r\nassessment.  I note with approval that MOE intends  to  teach\r\n\r\nour   young   to   think  creatively  and   apply   knowledge\r\n\r\ninnovatively.  I also note that to this end, MOE  intends  to\r\n\r\nrevise   the   curriculum  to  infuse  thinking  skills   and\r\n\r\nincorporate  the  use  of IT in the design  and  delivery  of\r\n\r\nsyllabuses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that every child would learn in an IT-enriched school environment over the next several years. I\r\n\r\nfully  understand the rationale for integrating IT  into  the\r\n\r\nvery  fabric  of our curriculum.  Information  technology  is\r\n\r\ntransforming  the  world  we live  in,  and  to  be  computer\r\n\r\nliterate  is  today a basic prerequisite for success  in  the\r\n\r\nglobal  economy.  However, I am not entirely  convinced  that\r\n\r\nfostering IT savvy young people is synonymous with breeding a\r\n\r\ncreative and thinking young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, computer literacy is very important but it must\r\n\r\nnever  supplant  books as a child's best friend.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  in our quest to create an IT savvy next generation,  we\r\n\r\nmust  not lose sight of the truth that true creativity  comes\r\n\r\nnot  from  five  hours of surfing on the  Internet  but  from\r\n\r\nreading  and appreciating the classics of the past.   Reading\r\n\r\ngood books forces the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmind to visualise and to imagine the basic skills of creative\r\n\r\nthinking.  I thus would argue that in tandem with the  effort\r\n\r\nto promote computer literacy, MOE should also promote a basic\r\n\r\nreading  programme to encourage the habit of reading  amongst\r\n\r\nour young people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of good books can be drawn which would comprise\r\n\r\nthe classics, which every young person should read as part of\r\n\r\nhis   intellectual,  aesthetic  and  cultural  education  and\r\n\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, starting this reading programme at a late primary\r\n\r\nschool  level would ensure that by the time our  young  reach\r\n\r\nuniversity  and  branch  out  into  the  hard  sciences   and\r\n\r\nengineering disciplines, in particular, they would  at  least\r\n\r\nhave  had  some  exposure  to good  literature.   Hence,  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to enhance their imaginative and creative skills.\r\n\r\nThis policy would ensure that it is not only students in  the\r\n\r\narts  and  humanities who benefit from world literature.   In\r\n\r\nshort, what we need to foster creativity amongst our young is\r\n\r\nnot  so much computer literacy, but a true literacy in  every\r\n\r\nsense  of the word.  In other words, the habit and even  love\r\n\r\nof reading must be inculcated in our students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Dr Aline K.</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Wong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to just\r\n\r\ntake  a  short while to respond to Mdm Claire Chiang's points\r\n\r\nabout Chinese High School.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was a little aware of her thinking on the\r\n\r\nmatter,  I was taken by surprise by the strong stand and  the\r\n\r\nemphatic way in which she described the matter, especially in\r\n\r\nthe  context  of civil society.  In the case of the  students\r\n\r\nwho are in their teen years, they still need strong guidance.\r\n\r\nIt  is not exactly a very good example to use, just from this\r\n\r\nissue  alone,  and say that we should be sympathetic  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents because we are talking about civil society and  this\r\n\r\nis the kind of emotions that we want people to express.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Chinese High School, I also felt, at\r\n\r\nthe beginning, that there was nothing wrong with the students\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  sentiments towards their  school  and  the\r\n\r\nprincipal, who has done a marvellous job for the school.   As\r\n\r\nMdm  Claire  Chiang said, the students themselves also  think\r\n\r\nthat  they have done nothing wrong.  They have only expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  tremendous attachment to the school and the principal.\r\n\r\nBut  Mdm  Claire Chaing also said that, as a parent  herself,\r\n\r\nshe may be worried that these young people may get themselves\r\n\r\ninto  a  situation  where they could  easily  be  misled  and\r\n\r\nperhaps even made use of.  Actually this is the way that  MOE\r\n\r\nhas  looked at it.  MOE's view is that there is nothing wrong\r\n\r\nwith  the  students expressing their sentiments  towards  the\r\n\r\nschool  and the principal.  But it was inappropriate for  the\r\n\r\nstudents  to be drawn into management matters where  already,\r\n\r\nat  that point of time, the board of directors of the company\r\n\r\nthat  owns  the  school  was  no longer  in  control  of  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  of the school.  The management of the school  was\r\n\r\nalready  in the hands of the Committee of Management of  MOE.\r\n\r\nSo  it was inappropriate for the students to be drawn into  a\r\n\r\nmatter  which  relates to the management of the school  under\r\n\r\nthe influence of the board of directors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I knew more about the details, that there was in\r\n\r\nfact  a press conference called by the Chairman of the  board\r\n\r\nof  directors and the students were present, my reaction  was\r\n\r\nvery  different.  I said that this was wrong.   The  students\r\n\r\nshould not have allowed themselves to be drawn into a dispute\r\n\r\nthat involved a board of directors that had already gone into\r\n\r\ndispute with the school.  My worry at that time was: are  the\r\n\r\nstudents  sure what they are doing?  Do they really know  the\r\n\r\ncomplexities  of  the situation and whether all  the  factors\r\n\r\nhave been made clear to them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I also felt that it was inappropriate for the\r\n\r\nboard  of  directors to draw in the students.   Things  could\r\n\r\nhave  been resolved within the school.  If the principal  and\r\n\r\nvice-principals of the school had explained  clearly  to  the\r\n\r\nstudents their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndecision  to  resign  -  and in fact it was  known  that  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  had  wanted to retire and he  had  handed  in  his\r\n\r\nletter in August, and the Committee of Management of MOE  had\r\n\r\nasked  him to stay on until the end of the year, but he  said\r\n\r\nno  and that he had decided to retire early -  he could  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  the  situation better and the whole thing  could  be\r\n\r\nresolved.  So the Chinese High School incident should not  be\r\n\r\nmade  into such a big thing to become an illustration of  how\r\n\r\ncivil society should be like.  That is really stretching  the\r\n\r\nmatter a bit too much.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh:</b> I agree with the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State, Dr Wong, with what she said  that  board\r\n\r\nmatters  should  not be the concern of students.   If  I  had\r\n\r\nsounded emphatic (here I am trying to lower my tone just now)\r\n\r\nit   is  because  I  spoke  with passion  when  dealing  with\r\n\r\nteenagers.  I must declare my interest here.  My son  who  is\r\n\r\n17  years  old  is  from Hwa Chong.  He is therefore  an  ex-student  of Chinese High School.  Therefore, I am in  contact\r\n\r\nwith  the  Chinese High School students who shared this  with\r\n\r\nme,  for which reason I therefore brought this up as  a  case\r\n\r\nfor discussion, not to illustrate the extent of civil society\r\n\r\nper  se, but to look at the permissions that can be given  to\r\n\r\n14-16  years  old to act.  That was the spirit with  which  I\r\n\r\nbrought this case illustration to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would agree that they do need strong guidance. But,\r\n\r\nas I said, I belong to a school of thought that also believes\r\n\r\nthat  people should be left alone to learn on their own.   If\r\n\r\nyou  are  holding their hands all the time, they  will  never\r\n\r\nlearn  independently.  This is a judgment call.  We  are  all\r\n\r\ntrained  differently and think differently.   That  is  where\r\n\r\nmaybe  the  constructive disagreement that Mr Davinder  Singh\r\n\r\nsaid  comes about.  From constructive disagreement,  we  have\r\n\r\nnot  reached a point of consensus which should be weighed  to\r\n\r\nhelp  us  in  this  constructive engagement to  discuss  this\r\n\r\nfurther  and  perhaps look for some constructive  resolution.\r\n\r\nThis is an evolving process and I hope that the Ministry does\r\n\r\nnot  take  this as a blaming session but to take this  as  an\r\n\r\nopportunity\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfor us to think it through one way or the other and debate in\r\n\r\nthe true sense of the word.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, as a parent myself, if my\r\n\r\nson had been involved in this kind of incident in this manner\r\n\r\nand  he told me afterwards, my advice would be: \"You be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  the  next time.  You do not know what  is  going  on\r\n\r\nbehind all the complications of the dispute and so on.  Don't\r\n\r\nbe  used  by  anybody.

It  is  not  unknown.  There are problems  with  the\r\n\r\nmanagement  in terms of the style, methods and so  on.   This\r\n\r\nhas  affected the standing of the school in the eyes  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.

Both\r\n\r\nprocesses  will influence the contact between  employers  and\r\n\r\nworkers  and thus affect the credibility of our aged  workers\r\n\r\nto  continue  working.  We have seen the trend  from  various\r\n\r\nsectors   affecting   our   workers   regardless   of    age.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this trend will affect more the older  workers\r\n\r\naged 40 years and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are not concerned with the young workers\r\n\r\nor  future  workers who are now studying who  will  gain  the\r\n\r\nskills because the opportunity for them to be employable  for\r\n\r\nlife  is  being  nurtured now.  The  problem  is  with  older\r\n\r\nworkers  aged  40 years and above who are without  the  basic\r\n\r\nskills even though they may have the experience.  This  issue\r\n\r\nhas  been  raised  by  many  parties,  including  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  in these three days of debate.  But   I  believe\r\n\r\nthis has to be emphasised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have dramatic stories to tell but I hope that\r\n\r\nour  workers  will grab all opportunities that they  have  to\r\n\r\nenhance their skills so that they will remain employable  for\r\n\r\ntheir  own  interest.  In the midst of the economic  downturn\r\n\r\nearly  this year, I met a worker who was retrenched after  16\r\n\r\nyears  because  his  company  transferred  its  manufacturing\r\n\r\noperations  to Batam.  He saw me after four months  of  being\r\n\r\nunemployed  and seemed concerned.  He said that half  of  his\r\n\r\ncompensation  of  $16,000 which he  received  would  be  gone\r\n\r\nwithin  a  matter of months if he did not find an alternative\r\n\r\njob.  The money was compensation of half a month's salary for\r\n\r\nevery  year  of  service as a production  supervisor  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany.    Fortunately, he found an  alternative  job  as  a\r\n\r\nmaintenance  supervisor, but I was  concerned  that  such  an\r\n\r\nalternative  job would also not remain for long  if  his  new\r\n\r\nemployer    restructures   his   operations   and   practises\r\n\r\noutsourcing.  The irony was that the constituent had an NTC-3\r\n\r\nqualification 16 years ago.  The qualification is  no  longer\r\n\r\nrelevant  in  other  factories, especially  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\ncompetition from younger workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, while we should help the workers who need to\r\n\r\nfind  alternative jobs, what is more important is how we  can\r\n\r\nwiden  this  assistance to ensure that our  workers  who  are\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  retrenchment  can  have  their  employability\r\n\r\nenhanced through retraining and skills upgrading.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on a number of visits to the Skills Development\r\n\r\nCentre in Bukit Merah, I find that our workers who have  lost\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  and  who  have undergone skills  training  there\r\n\r\ngenerally have a positive attitude\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntowards   skills  upgrading.   They  realise  the  need   for\r\n\r\ntechnical  skills.  Government and employers should encourage\r\n\r\nand   open  more  opportunities  for  workers  such   as   my\r\n\r\nconstituent,  to  enhance  their skills  through  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme (SRP) for workers in service, so that\r\n\r\nthey  can remain employable.   But no less important  is  the\r\n\r\nneed  for the Government to open many more opportunities  for\r\n\r\nworkers  who  have  lost their jobs to gain  skills  training\r\n\r\nthrough the facilitated programme under the SRP.  The type of\r\n\r\ncourses  offered must also be widened.  As for  companies,  I\r\n\r\nhope  that they will employ more retrenched workers who  have\r\n\r\nbeen  retrained so that they can be independent  and  support\r\n\r\ntheir families.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major problem may arise if these retrained workers\r\n\r\nfind  difficulty  in getting jobs just because  employers  or\r\n\r\nfuture  employers pay very little attention to older workers.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  this is a form of investment.   Just  like  any\r\n\r\nother investment, there must be returns.  Our workers must at\r\n\r\nleast  respond  seriously to opportunities offered  in  their\r\n\r\ninterest.   Indeed, I believe that workers should also  share\r\n\r\nthe  responsibility  of bearing some of the  cost  for  their\r\n\r\nskills training.  We should study in detail as to how we  can\r\n\r\nobtain  the best benefit, whether through the CPF  scheme  or\r\n\r\nchannelling some of the retrenchment benefits or  some  other\r\n\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.19 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our labour movement plays a major role in assisting our\r\n\r\nworkers to ensure their welfare through enhancement of  their\r\n\r\nemployability.   NTUC  and  its affiliates  play  a  role  in\r\n\r\npreserving  jobs  during our economic downturn.   Our  unions\r\n\r\nhave  taken proactive measures to ensure the welfare  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers  by identifying the challenges and problems that  may\r\n\r\narise  in  future and to propose solutions, even though  they\r\n\r\nseem  to  be bitter initially.  In other words, NTUC and  the\r\n\r\nlabour movement in Singapore are members of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  civil  society  that is important to  Singapore.   As  a\r\n\r\nresult of their roles, the life and welfare of Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbeen improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, to be a member of the civil society,\r\n\r\nwe  should  not only make political comments.   Hundreds  and\r\n\r\nthousands of union leaders at the various levels have  played\r\n\r\na  constructive  role  in  further  improving  the  lives  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  without touching on political matters  alone.   We\r\n\r\nshould  encourage active citizenship such as this in  various\r\n\r\nfields.  That  includes  grassroots activities  such  as  the\r\n\r\nResidents'  Committees  and  self-help  groups.  This   would\r\n\r\nenhance  the  bond  between the people of Singapore,  whether\r\n\r\nracially,   between   people   of  different   socio-economic\r\n\r\nbackgrounds and between Singaporeans and foreign workers  who\r\n\r\nare living here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active citizenship need not be separate from organs of\r\n\r\nstate.  In the matter of inter-racial relations, I agree with\r\n\r\nthe proposal by Mr Yatiman Yusof that we set up an agency for\r\n\r\npolicy  studies  to build a Singapore nation.   Or  at  least\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  periodic  studies  to  evaluate  how   far\r\n\r\nSingapore   has   been  more  cohesive.   Besides   enhancing\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between the people, the races  and  religions,\r\n\r\nthrough studies and discussions, this effort can suggest  new\r\n\r\nactivities  towards this objective to enhance cohesion  among\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in relation to ethnic relations, it\r\n\r\nis  indeed  sensitive  but  it  has  to  be  discussed.   The\r\n\r\nstatement by the Senior Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, has caused\r\n\r\nmany  Malays  to  be unhappy because they  felt  that  it  is\r\n\r\nquestioning  their  loyalty.   Some  also  felt  that   these\r\n\r\nquestions should not have been raised openly.  If some Malays\r\n\r\nhave  expressed  their disappointment and  unhappiness,  they\r\n\r\nneed  not  be  irrational.  This is an  expression  of  their\r\n\r\nfeelings.  However, generally, Malays feel that Singapore  is\r\n\r\ntheir motherland and it is where their loyalty lies.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nif we are going to build a Singapore nation, we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nneed  to  discuss sensitive matters such as  this.   However,\r\n\r\nalthough  it  is  true that mutual trust will  take  time  to\r\n\r\nachieve, it need not be allowed to take forever.  The  Malays\r\n\r\nand  Muslims and other minorities must decide how  to  manage\r\n\r\ntheir  feelings whenever sensitive issues such as  these  are\r\n\r\ndiscussed.   However, although they feel unhappy, considering\r\n\r\ntheir  position  as  the  minority  group,  they  must   also\r\n\r\nunderstand  that, as has been discussed before in this  House\r\n\r\nand  raised  by the Prime Minister just now, the Chinese  who\r\n\r\nform  the majority in Singapore are a minority in the region.\r\n\r\nOther   races   too  must  understand  their   sensitivities.\r\n\r\nHowever,  as  I  mentioned earlier, at  the  same  time,  the\r\n\r\nsensitivities of the Malays and the minorities must  also  be\r\n\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not completely cover the fissures between the\r\n\r\nraces just by discussing or debating sensitive issues.   Just\r\n\r\nbecause  we want to fill up these fissures, it does not  mean\r\n\r\nthat  these  fissures will no longer exist.  And if  we  have\r\n\r\nmade  progress, it does not mean that differences of opinions\r\n\r\nand sensitivities will not occur in future.  What is clear is\r\n\r\nthat  we  must continue to improve on it.  We must strengthen\r\n\r\nthe  understanding  among each other  to  build  cohesion  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I hope that further discussion on such issues  can\r\n\r\ntake  these matters into consideration.  All participants  of\r\n\r\nthe civil society must understand this reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the motion by Mr Davinder\r\n\r\nSingh.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, Sir, the President stressed  in  his  Speech\r\n\r\nthat  we  must strengthen our social cohesion, that  we  must\r\n\r\nstrengthen our common Singaporean identity and, at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  must  encourage all our people  to  become  active\r\n\r\ncitizens,  thus  showing the major focus of our  Government's\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People form the foundation of a nation. When the\r\n\r\nfoundation  is strong, the nation will prosper.   All  along,\r\n\r\nthe  Government's policy has been benefiting the  people  and\r\n\r\nthe country.  To our people, we stress the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nimportance  of education and training as the way  to  develop\r\n\r\nthe  intellect of the people, to increase their knowledge and\r\n\r\nto  enhance  their skills.  Therefore, it is  ridiculous  for\r\n\r\nBuruma,  a  foreign  columnist, to say that  Singapore  is  a\r\n\r\ncountry practising the obscurantist policy under which people\r\n\r\nbecome  stupid and cannot think.  This is far from the truth.\r\n\r\nIf  we  say  that the Singapore Government is  an  autocratic\r\n\r\ngovernment, then all the policies practised by the Government\r\n\r\nwill  all  be  wrong.  Because an autocratic government  will\r\n\r\nimplement obscurantist policy like the first emperor  of  the\r\n\r\nQin  Dynasty to burn all books and to bury the scholars.  But\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government did no such thing.  On the contrary,\r\n\r\nits  policy  is aimed at helping our people to march  towards\r\n\r\nthe high technology and knowledge-based IT society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, I can say that the Government has\r\n\r\nbeen  taking very good care of the people.  Over  time,  this\r\n\r\nhas caused the people to be over-dependent on the Government.\r\n\r\nIn  other  words,  our  people expect the  Government  to  do\r\n\r\neverything  for  them,  and they  seem  to  be  losing  their\r\n\r\ninitiative.  I think this is an anomaly that we must correct.\r\n\r\nThe  society cannot always depend on the Government to  drive\r\n\r\nthem  around.   The people must have their own initiative  to\r\n\r\ntake  part  actively.  I think this is the  true  meaning  of\r\n\r\nactive citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, as the President has pointed out in his\r\n\r\nSpeech, we have enjoyed one whole generation of racial\r\n\r\nharmony.  But we cannot presume that the various social fault\r\n\r\nlines have already disappeared.  There still exist in our\r\n\r\nsociety some  clear and obvious barriers, including racial\r\n\r\nbarriers, religious barriers, language barriers, cultural\r\n\r\nbarriers, and even barriers in education streams.  To create\r\n\r\na more cohesive society and to forge a stronger sense of\r\n\r\nSingaporean identity, we must try our best to remove all\r\n\r\nthese barriers.  We must encourage our people to become\r\n\r\nactive citizens.  We must create a more participatory\r\n\r\nsociety.  In terms of removing the barriers, we must adopt a\r\n\r\nmore positive attitude and active approach.  So I feel that\r\n\r\nthe initiative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nshould not always come from the Government.  More initiatives\r\n\r\nshould now come from our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school is a place where we inculcate in our young\r\n\r\nthe  right  values and national identity.  So the unification\r\n\r\nof  the  language  streams  in our schools  has  removed  the\r\n\r\nlanguage barrier.  But this is only applicable to the case of\r\n\r\nthe  new  generation.   Those who have  come  from  the  past\r\n\r\nlanguage stream schools, I think the barriers still exist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can approach the problem from the following areas:\r\n\r\nFirstly,    through   the  grassroots  and   the   community.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  through  the  mass media.   Thirdly,  through  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Let me first talk about the grassroots  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity.   The  grassroots  organisations  (GROs)  and  the\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  play  a very  important  role.   The  GRO\r\n\r\nmembers, such as RC members, CCC members, CCMC members,  etc,\r\n\r\nhave  set  a  very  good  example.   Through  the  grassroots\r\n\r\nnetwork, we are able to communicate a very important  message\r\n\r\nto  our  people and, that is, the citizens can actively  take\r\n\r\npart.   There  are  many channels for them to  take  part  in\r\n\r\npublic  affairs.  The question is whether you  want  to  take\r\n\r\npart  or  not.  It is not a question of whether  you  can  or\r\n\r\ncannot  take part.  The question is whether or not you  want.\r\n\r\nSo   the  various  activities  organised  by  the  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  encourage the various residents  of  different\r\n\r\nethnic  groups to take part to interact and to break  through\r\n\r\nthe barrier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the mid-Autumn Festival or the Lantern Festival\r\n\r\nis basically a Chinese festival, I  noticed that there was  a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough  in  the  Festival this  year.   The  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  encouraged children from  the  various  ethnic\r\n\r\ngroups  to  take part in the  traditionally Chinese festival.\r\n\r\nIt  helped  to  promote  some kind of interaction  among  the\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the various ethnic groups, and gave  them  some\r\n\r\ngood  time together.  This is very important in strengthening\r\n\r\nour Singaporean identity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, all our ethnic communities have\r\n\r\ntheir own wealth of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncultural  traditions.  It is important to preserve one's  own\r\n\r\ncultural  traditions.  But if you want to create  a  stronger\r\n\r\nSingaporean consciousness and identity, we must break through\r\n\r\nthese  traditions.   In this regard, I think  the  activities\r\n\r\norganised  by the grassroots organisations are good examples.\r\n\r\nLeaders  of  the  various ethnic groups should  change  their\r\n\r\nmindset  and  must  put  in  efforts  to  ensure  that  while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  their  own fine cultural traditions,  they  must\r\n\r\nalso  actively try to remove the barriers among  the  various\r\n\r\nethnic groups.  I think there is no contradiction between the\r\n\r\ntwo.  One is to maintain the differences and the other is  to\r\n\r\ntry and create common ground.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the social level, the mass media have not been given\r\n\r\nenough  attention in this regard.  Take the  newspapers,  for\r\n\r\nexample.   As  of  now,  our newspapers  basically  go  along\r\n\r\nlanguage  lines.   The newspapers of the different  languages\r\n\r\nhave  different emphasis in their coverage of events and they\r\n\r\nalso  reflect  mainly the views of communities  speaking  the\r\n\r\nrespective languages.  This appears to be a commonly accepted\r\n\r\nmodel but, objectively speaking, this kind of situation  will\r\n\r\ncreate  barriers and imbalance in information  dissemination.\r\n\r\nFor  example,  the Lianhe Zaobao  has a lot of stories  about\r\n\r\nthe  Chinese  community every day, some of which  are  hardly\r\n\r\ncarried in the other language newspapers. On the other  hand,\r\n\r\nBerita Harian, the Malay language newspaper, concentrates  on\r\n\r\nreports on the Malay community and carries the views of Malay\r\n\r\nMPs  and  activities in the Malay community.  In my view,  to\r\n\r\nhave a more cohesive society, this kind of arrangement should\r\n\r\nbe adjusted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite three examples to illustrate this point: the\r\n\r\nSAP  school, the Chinese High School incident and  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity's request for dialogue with SM Lee.  Not long  ago,\r\n\r\nthe  question  of  SAP schools was debated quite  intensively\r\n\r\nboth  inside and outside this House.  This highlights a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  point that people from different communities  with\r\n\r\ndifferent educational backgrounds have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndifferent  understanding.   There  is  a  barrier  in   their\r\n\r\nunderstanding.  So from the English newspaper's point of view\r\n\r\nor  reaction,  you  can  observe that  many  of  the  English\r\n\r\neducated do not quite understand the meaning of a SAP school.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese  and  English newspaper readers  have  different\r\n\r\nreactions.   The  English educated are more critical  on  the\r\n\r\nissue,  whereas  the  Chinese  newspaper  readers  are   more\r\n\r\ndefensive about the SAP schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Chinese newspapers you can hear the views on\r\n\r\nthe  subject  from the Chinese educated.  They represent  the\r\n\r\nvoice of the Chinese community, but we do not see or hear the\r\n\r\nviews  or  reactions from the Malay community or  the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity.  This is one example.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Chinese High School incident. I am not here\r\n\r\nto  comment  on  this  matter, but the  Chinese  High  School\r\n\r\nincident is a matter of concern to various people.  The  same\r\n\r\nincident as reported in the different language newspapers can\r\n\r\ncreate different impressions.   For instance, on the issue of\r\n\r\nwhether  the students should be involved in this affair,  the\r\n\r\nEnglish-educated readers reacted very strongly.   They  wrote\r\n\r\nto  the  Forum  page and advocated that students  have  their\r\n\r\nrights,  but  there is no such view reflected in the  Chinese\r\n\r\nnewspaper. The Chinese educated parents feel that it is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  that  the  problem  be resolved quickly,  but  the\r\n\r\nstudents  should  not  be involved.   A  presumably  English-educated   columnist   in  an  English   language   newspaper\r\n\r\nmistakenly took the singing of Yue Fei's Man Jiang Hong (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to mean a bloodshed that forms a blood-red river, and even\r\n\r\nextended  her  imagination to visualize a Bukit  Timah  canal\r\n\r\nbecoming a blood-red river.  You do not find such a thing  in\r\n\r\nthe Chinese newspaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three characters man jiang hong ( ) may\r\n\r\nliterally mean the whole river is red. But actually, this  is\r\n\r\nmerely the name of the tune to which ci (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) poems were\r\n\r\ncomposed,  predominantly in the Song  dynasty.   Examples  of\r\n\r\nother such tunes are: man ting fang (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),\r\n\r\nshui long yin (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), shui diao getou\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) etc. Man Jiang Hong is just one\r\n\r\nof  these  names of set tunes.  It does not signify that  the\r\n\r\nwhole river is red, full of blood.  There is no such meaning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am trying to point out is that the reports of the\r\n\r\nvarious  language  newspapers  reflect  different  views  and\r\n\r\ndifferent understanding of issues.  So if you read  only  the\r\n\r\nChinese  newspapers or  only the English newspapers, then  on\r\n\r\nthe   same  event,  for  example,  the  Chinese  High  School\r\n\r\nincident,  you may have different impressions,  and  come  to\r\n\r\ndifferent conclusions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last example or illustration I would like to mention\r\n\r\nis  on the statement of SM Lee which generated some reactions\r\n\r\namong  the  Malay community.  This is about the  position  of\r\n\r\nMalays  in  our armed forces.  This is not a new issue.   But\r\n\r\nevery  time  it  is mentioned, it creates a strong  reaction.\r\n\r\nJust  now, Mr Hawazi also mentioned about this in his speech.\r\n\r\nSome  members  of  the Malay community have requested  for  a\r\n\r\ndialogue  with SM Lee.  On this issue, if you have  read  the\r\n\r\nBerita  Harian,  you  will know that  the  Malay  community's\r\n\r\nreaction  on  the  matter  is very strong.   There  are  also\r\n\r\ncomments  and  opinions expressed.  But in the  case  of  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  of other languages, the report is less prominent.\r\n\r\nSo  we  would  not be able to learn from the  other  language\r\n\r\nnewspapers that kind of strong reaction as reflected  in  the\r\n\r\nMalay language newspaper.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for those people who do not read the Malay newspaper\r\n\r\nor those who read only the Chinese or English newspaper, they\r\n\r\nmay  even  get  the  wrong impression that  this  is  not  an\r\n\r\nimportant  issue.  They may  not even be interested  in  this\r\n\r\nissue  at  all.   But  actually, this is an  issue  that  all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  be concerned with.   There  is  nothing\r\n\r\nwrong   with   newspapers  of  different   languages   giving\r\n\r\nprominence  to news or events concerning their own respective\r\n\r\ncommunities. But in order to strengthen our social  cohesion,\r\n\r\nthe  newspapers  of different languages should  go  one  step\r\n\r\nfurther  to  play a positive role.  For example, the  various\r\n\r\nnewspapers of different languages should set up a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nseparate  column  to  report on other communities  so  as  to\r\n\r\nexchange  information throughout all the various  communities\r\n\r\nto promote better understanding of one another and for better\r\n\r\ndissemination of information.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to deal with the Government and\r\n\r\nthe  public sector.  The unification of the language  streams\r\n\r\nof  schools  is  important  for  the  creation  of  a  common\r\n\r\nidentity.  But this development has also created a  sense  of\r\n\r\nalienation among some communities, especially in the  Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity.   The older members of the Chinese community  have\r\n\r\nall  along  been active in the grassroots organisations.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  they are the backbone of the grassroots organisations.\r\n\r\nThey have not only taken part in charitable work, in the clan\r\n\r\nactivities,  community activities, but they have  also  taken\r\n\r\npart in the grassroots organisations like the CCC, RC and the\r\n\r\nCCMC. They donate money.  They put in efforts.  I think  this\r\n\r\nis  very  closely  linked  with their educational  background\r\n\r\nbecause  most  of  these  people are  businessmen.   So  they\r\n\r\npractise  the  idea  of  deriving from society  and  repaying\r\n\r\nsociety.   They  have this belief and philosophy.   They  are\r\n\r\ndifferent from our younger generation who are basically wage-earners.  So financially, the younger generation may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  contribute so much by donating money  and  spending\r\n\r\ntime  and efforts at the same time.  However, because of  the\r\n\r\ndominance of the English language in our society, this  group\r\n\r\nof  active  Chinese community leaders begin to feel  cut  off\r\n\r\nfrom  the  mainstream in our society.  They have a  sense  of\r\n\r\nloss.   They  feel that they are being rejected  out  of  the\r\n\r\nmainstream  of society.   This is a question which   we  must\r\n\r\nseriously look into in our attempt to create a more  cohesive\r\n\r\nsociety.   This  group of people may not  be  able  to  speak\r\n\r\nEnglish  or may not be able to speak English well.  But  they\r\n\r\nhave set up, as I have pointed out earlier, good examples  as\r\n\r\nactive citizens in our society. We must continue to give them\r\n\r\nthe  due respect, listen to their views, listen to what  they\r\n\r\nhave in their hearts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in short, we want to create a\r\n\r\ncommon heartware of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Then we must change the present  social  make-up.   Now we still have different kinds of heartware  in  our\r\n\r\ndifferent   communities.   For  example,  we  have  different\r\n\r\nheartware  of different ethnic groups, different  educational\r\n\r\nstreams, and so on and so forth.  We want to create a  common\r\n\r\nSingapore  heartware.  If we want to break  through  the  old\r\n\r\nmodel and create a new one here, we must put in more efforts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I thank all Members who have  joined  in  the\r\n\r\ndebate.  It was lively and interesting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members spoke on a wide variety of issues. Their\r\n\r\nspeeches  reflect the views of Singaporeans.  Some  of  their\r\n\r\nconcerns  have been addressed by the Prime Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinisters  who  joined  in  the  debate.   But  many  of  the\r\n\r\nquestions which have been raised are not capable of  easy  or\r\n\r\nready   answers.   The  dialogue  on  these  issues   between\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and the Government will continue for  years  to\r\n\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate has been characterised by three broad\r\n\r\nthemes.  First, the Government's people orientation.  Second,\r\n\r\nthe  consensus  in this House about what the  Government  has\r\n\r\ndone  right  and, third, the sad and disappointing recurrence\r\n\r\nof cliches from Members of the Opposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the policies for the people. The focus on people\r\n\r\ntook centre stage. There was a useful exchange of views about\r\n\r\ncivil  society and active citizenship.  Many MPs spoke  about\r\n\r\nthe need to give people more space, while recognising that it\r\n\r\nis  a  two-way  deal.   We are agreed on certain  fundamental\r\n\r\npoints.   Firstly, that it will take us a long, long time  to\r\n\r\nsettle on a consensus.  Secondly, that to a large extent, the\r\n\r\ninitiative lies with the people because a top-down dictate on\r\n\r\npublic  participation  in the affairs  of  the  nation  is  a\r\n\r\nparadox.  And thirdly, we must involve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npeople  of  all  backgrounds, different  education,  English,\r\n\r\nChinese, different races, different religions to settle at an\r\n\r\nacceptable  compromise.  But we also have to understand  that\r\n\r\nthese  concepts  of civil society and active citizenship  are\r\n\r\nnot pegs on which to hang any argument because the moment  we\r\n\r\ndescend  into  argument for argument sake, we will  not  only\r\n\r\nlose but kill the momentum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs made the very good point that there is\r\n\r\nnothing new in this emphasis on people.  The Government  has,\r\n\r\never  since it has taken office, had people at the  forefront\r\n\r\nof its policies.  In return for being elected, the Government\r\n\r\nhas  looked after the needs of Singaporeans - housing,  jobs,\r\n\r\neducation, safety, healthcare, money in the pocket and in the\r\n\r\nbank. We have, in a manner of speaking, moved from black  and\r\n\r\nwhite  to colour. We have moved from basics in many instances\r\n\r\nto  luxuries  and in terms of material needs and  dignity  of\r\n\r\nlife,  we  have  very  little to  complain  about.   To  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  these policies have had and will  continue  to\r\n\r\nhave a far greater impact on them and their families than the\r\n\r\nissue of political space.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because these fundamentals have been settled that\r\n\r\nwe  can  afford  to shift the emphasis to the next  phase  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment.  Questions like, should we tinker with our model\r\n\r\nof  democracy, how do we change the attitudes of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto  learning  and life-long employability,  how  do  we  keep\r\n\r\nSingaporeans rooted, have been discussed in this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nature of the issue, people development is very\r\n\r\nmuch  tied to our education policy.  That explains  the  huge\r\n\r\ninterest in this debate in our education system.  We  clearly\r\n\r\nhave  a  good system but changes need to be made.   MPs  have\r\n\r\nmade  useful  suggestions.  The Minister  for  Education  has\r\n\r\ntalked about his Ministry's efforts to enhance the talent  of\r\n\r\nevery   student,  make  them  world-ready  while  rooted   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These  experiments will  not  address  everyone's\r\n\r\nconcerns.   They will generate anxieties of their  own.   But\r\n\r\nthe  point is, that MPs are willing to speak up in a rational\r\n\r\nand moderate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfashion if they and their constituents are unhappy, and  more\r\n\r\nimportantly,  that the Government is willing  to  change  and\r\n\r\nexperiment to deal with these concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this afternoon, we saw first-hand the impact of the\r\n\r\npleas  of  some of the MPs and NMPs in relation to compulsory\r\n\r\neducation.   That effort has paid dividends  with  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister saying that he is going to instruct the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation to look at compulsory education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have truly come a long way. We are now concerned\r\n\r\nabout the definition of \"success\".  But it is not an esoteric\r\n\r\nor  philosophical discussion.  It is important because it  is\r\n\r\nan  issue  whose time has come.  Parents are concerned  about\r\n\r\nthe  pressure in schools.  They grew up in a system where the\r\n\r\nbright  lights  shone  only on those who excel  academically.\r\n\r\nThey  are not sure if they want their children to go  through\r\n\r\nthe  same  grind.  MPs have spoken about the  need  for  more\r\n\r\ncharacter, as opposed to content development in the  schools.\r\n\r\nThe Government is reacting to this shift in attitudes. At the\r\n\r\nend of the day, we must strike some practical balance between\r\n\r\nour  determination to be number one in everything we  do  and\r\n\r\neasing out on the pressure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not going to be easy, all the more so when given\r\n\r\nour  ageing  society and the fact that we are  not  replacing\r\n\r\nourselves.  How  do  we continue to top the  charts  with  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly aging workforce and when the shrinking group  of\r\n\r\nyounger  workers  do  not consider that  drive  is  always  a\r\n\r\nvirtue?   If success is redefined to mean that endeavours  in\r\n\r\nenterprise are matters of fashion as opposed to necessity, we\r\n\r\nwill  all pay an economic price, what the Americans  call  \"a\r\n\r\ndouble whammy\", with lower growth and the increased burden of\r\n\r\nsupporting  an  aging  society.  It is  easy  to  talk  about\r\n\r\nletting  up  on  the  pressure, but it is very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nstrike that balance of continuing to be at the forefront  and\r\n\r\nrelevant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second theme which has marked this debate is the\r\n\r\nconsensus in this House about what the Government has done\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nright.  Interestingly enough, that consensus is apparent more\r\n\r\nfrom  what  was  not said in the debate than from  what  was.\r\n\r\nThis  debate has been significant for the non-issues as  much\r\n\r\nas  it  has  been for the issues. We have had three  days  of\r\n\r\ndebate.  There  were  more than 50 speakers.  They  spoke  at\r\n\r\nlength.   There  was  ample time and opportunity  to  express\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction.   Yet, not one Member had anything  critical\r\n\r\nto  say  about the honesty, integrity and credibility of  our\r\n\r\ninstitutions.   As the criticism in this House of  Government\r\n\r\npolicies  reflects the view of Singaporeans, so too the  lack\r\n\r\nof  criticism about our institutions.  Let us look at  a  few\r\n\r\nexamples which we tend to take for granted and which  explain\r\n\r\nwhy they are not raised in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Singapore judiciary. It is respected here\r\n\r\nand  around the world for its integrity and credibility.  Not\r\n\r\nmany people appreciate the importance of a credible judiciary\r\n\r\nto  a  country.   A  weak  or pliant  judiciary  can  have  a\r\n\r\ndevastating  effect  on  people and their  morale.  Like  the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of civil servants, the decisions of judges  affect\r\n\r\npeople  more directly than the policies which we  discuss  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.   Judges  ensure that there is  a  level-playing\r\n\r\nfield,  that  every  Singaporean, rich or  poor,  is  treated\r\n\r\nfairly  and on the merits.  A country is in big trouble  when\r\n\r\npeople lose trust in the legal and judicial system.  I do not\r\n\r\noverstate  the  case.  If a judicial system is  corrupt,  the\r\n\r\nrich get justice, the poor do not.  The powerful get justice,\r\n\r\nthe  weak do not.  Commercial disputes are settled not by the\r\n\r\nmerits,  but  by the strength of a party's purchasing  power.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  poor and the weak have no justice or believe  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  no  chance in the system, that system  will  soon\r\n\r\nunravel, maybe not in a year or two, but in time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our rights are protected regardless of who\r\n\r\nwe  are.  Our  disputes  are settled by  a  fair  and  proper\r\n\r\napplication of the law.  Our judges, like our civil  servants\r\n\r\nand  leaders, act on the principle that their credibility  is\r\n\r\neverything.   I  am  glad that we have  a  ringing  consensus\r\n\r\nalbeit by silence on that.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither was there an issue on the integrity of our civil\r\n\r\nservice.   No  amount of talk about policy changes  or  about\r\n\r\npolitical  space and the right to participate  will  and  can\r\n\r\nstop  a  people  from deserting a country physically  and  in\r\n\r\nspirit,  if people feel that the system is crooked  and  that\r\n\r\nthey have no chance.  There was no issue in this debate about\r\n\r\nour  credibility and consistency.  In Singapore, when we  set\r\n\r\nthe  rules, we play by those rules, in good times and in bad.\r\n\r\nForeign  investors know and have come to respect that.   Very\r\n\r\nfew  people understand the value of that asset.  It  accounts\r\n\r\nfor  our  standing in the commercial world.  It accounts  for\r\n\r\nour standing in the political world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move to the third broad theme of this debate. I\r\n\r\ndo it with some degree of sadness and disappointment.  When I\r\n\r\nopened the debate, I said that cliches and platitudes are not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  help  the  debate.   I  was  naive.   Despite  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to make constructive suggestions about  improving\r\n\r\nthe  system,  there has been nothing but a  torrent  of  wild\r\n\r\npropositions  from the Opposition. We are told, for  example,\r\n\r\nthat  the Government fears that the people will one day  rise\r\n\r\nagainst it.  Not only does it ring hollow, it is bizarre.  Is\r\n\r\nthat  what  people  are talking about in  the  streets?   Are\r\n\r\nSingaporeans who have come out best in this crisis clamouring\r\n\r\nfor  a  change of Government?  How do these absurd statements\r\n\r\nhelp  in  the debate?  How are Singaporeans better  off  from\r\n\r\nthis kind of contribution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also told that there is no democracy in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This, from a man who makes the point in  a  forum\r\n\r\nto  which he is democratically elected, in a debate which  is\r\n\r\nopen  to  the public and the media. This, from a man who  has\r\n\r\nspent his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npolitical life vilifying this Government and yet remains free\r\n\r\nto  enjoy  the freedom to do it again and again.  Is  that  a\r\n\r\nhelpful  contribution to the debate?  Are we any wiser  about\r\n\r\nthe kind of model that we should seek to construct?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, the question we have to ask\r\n\r\nourselves  is:   has  this debate helped in  the  process  of\r\n\r\nnation-building?   Have  we  contributed  to  a  constructive\r\n\r\ndiscussion which is good for the country?  Members have  made\r\n\r\nmany thought provoking comments and suggestions. They deserve\r\n\r\nfurther  consideration.  For that, I thank Members.   I  also\r\n\r\nthank them for supporting the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I thank you, Sir, and Mr Speaker, Sir, for your\r\n\r\npatience.
