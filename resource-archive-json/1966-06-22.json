Both  these\r\n\r\napproach  and  exit  roads are  made  into  one-way\r\n\r\nstreets because of their narrowness. Mattar Road is\r\n\r\n18 feet wide and Jalan Merpati 22 feet wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pesiaran Keliling, however, is 31 feet wide and\r\n\r\nthe  total  distance is 1.1 miles round the  Estate\r\n\r\nfrom  its  commencement at its junction with  Jalan\r\n\r\nMerpati.  This  road  was constructed  sufficiently\r\n\r\nwide  enough to carry two-way traffic. If this road\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  converted into one-way,  it  will  be\r\n\r\ncausing     undue    hardship    and    unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  the residents  in  this  Housing\r\n\r\nEstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to (b) , the Omnibus Services Licensing\r\n\r\nAuthority  has approved extensions of bus  services\r\n\r\ninto  the  Macpherson Housing Estate. The  Omni-bus\r\n\r\nServices  Licensing  Authority  has  approved   two\r\n\r\nS.T.C. bus  services which would operate  in  this\r\n\r\nHousing Estate. The first is a deviation of part of\r\n\r\nS.T.C.  Service No. 12, to be known as Service  No.\r\n\r\n12A,  from  Macpherson  Housing  Estate  via  Jalan\r\n\r\nBesar, New Bridge Road/North Bridge Road to Shenton\r\n\r\nWay.  The second is an extension of S.T.C.  Service\r\n\r\nNo.  9 from Shenton Way via Alexandra Road, Tanglin\r\n\r\nRoad, Orchard Road and Serangoon Road to Macpherson\r\n\r\nEstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Omnibus Services Licensing Authority also has\r\n\r\nbefore it two applications from the Tay Koh Yat Bus\r\n\r\nCo.

These  two  applications  were\r\n\r\nadvertised in the local Press on 13th May, 1966 and\r\n\r\nwill   be   considered  by  the  Omnibus   Services\r\n\r\nLicensing   Authority   one   month   after   their\r\n\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to (c) , it is proposed to draw a\r\n\r\ncontinuous  white  line  along  Pesiaran  Keliling,\r\n\r\nJalan Pipit and Jalan Balam. This will ensure  that\r\n\r\nno  vehicles are parked along this road  and  there\r\n\r\nwould  be a smooth flow of traffic. Sufficient  car\r\n\r\nparks  and parking bays have been provided in  this\r\n\r\nhousing estate to cater for the residents. The  car\r\n\r\nparks   and  parking  bays  are  now  occupied   by\r\n\r\nunlicensed  hawkers, causing the  owners  of  motor\r\n\r\ncars  to  park  their vehicles on the road  proper.\r\n\r\nThis  has  created  some confusion  along  Pesiaran\r\n\r\nKeliling,  particularly at its junction with  Jalan\r\n\r\nMerpati.  Once  the  hawkers  are  removed  to  the\r\n\r\nmarket, which has been completed recently, the  car\r\n\r\nparks  and  parking  bays could  be  used  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  for  which they are constructed.  It  will\r\n\r\nnot,  therefore, be necessary for residents to park\r\n\r\ntheir vehicles on the road proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>APPLICANTS FOR DRIVING LICENCES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Change of Parking Test Site)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

In  May\r\n\r\n1966, 3,519 persons took this test of whom 105 were\r\n\r\nTamils. This works out roughly at three per cent as\r\n\r\nbeing Tamil-speaking testees, and most of them were\r\n\r\nalso able to speak either English or Malay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are at present two Senior Testers, both\r\n\r\nChinese,  and  18 testers, of whom 13 are  Chinese,\r\n\r\ntwo  Eurasians, one Malay, one Singhalese  and  one\r\n\r\nTamil. The number of Tamils at the moment is small.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  number justifies it, more Tamil  testers\r\n\r\nwill  be  employed  and the use of  Tamil  will  be\r\n\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Testees for Highway Code tests are assigned to\r\n\r\nvarious  testers so that testees cannot choose  the\r\n\r\ntester  nor  the tester his testees. If the  testee\r\n\r\nfails  his test, a different tester is assigned  to\r\n\r\nhim for his next test.

Secondly,  as\r\n\r\nTrafalgar  Home, which adjoins Woodbridge Hospital,\r\n\r\nis  only half-full, a section of Trafalgar Home  is\r\n\r\nnow  being renovated and converted for the transfer\r\n\r\nof  the  chronically sick from Woodbridge Hospital,\r\n\r\nin  order  to relieve the congestion at the  latter\r\n\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Outram Road General Hospital, it\r\n\r\nhas  been  necessary to alleviate the  pressure  of\r\n\r\nnumbers  by a quicker turnover of patients and  the\r\n\r\naverage  length of stay of patients is around  nine\r\n\r\ndays per patient. It is agreed that this is not  an\r\n\r\nideal method, but has to be resorted to until  such\r\n\r\ntime  as  more hospitals can be built and, what  is\r\n\r\neven  more  important,  more staff,  i.e, doctors,\r\n\r\nnurses   and   technicians,   and   equipment   are\r\n\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effort, however, has already been made to\r\n\r\nrelieve   the  pressures  on  Outram  Road  General\r\n\r\nHospital  with  the  setting  up  of  two  surgical\r\n\r\ntheatres in Thomson Road Hospital in January  1965,\r\n\r\nthus  converting it into Singapore's second General\r\n\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two effective steps have already been taken to\r\n\r\nrelieve the pressure in Kandang Kerbau Hospital. In\r\n\r\norder   to  encourage  greater  use  of  our   Free\r\n\r\nDomiciliary Midwifery service, a nominal charge  of\r\n\r\n$10 was levied for 'C' Class patients from December\r\n\r\n1964. Next, Government has given full publicity for\r\n\r\nsome  time  regarding the need to  offer  Singapore\r\n\r\nmothers  the  latest techniques in Family  Planning\r\n\r\nand  have,  in fact, established a Family  Planning\r\n\r\nand  Population  Board  in  January  this  year  to\r\n\r\nimplement a 5-Year Family Planning programme in all\r\n\r\nMaternal and Child Health Centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both these measures, I am glad to say, have shown\r\n\r\nimmediate and heartening results.

The countries visited  were\r\n\r\nPoland,   Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,   Rumania   and\r\n\r\nBulgaria,  and the tour itself lasted  18  days.  I\r\n\r\nthink no useful purpose will be served by giving  a\r\n\r\ndetailed account of our conversations with each  of\r\n\r\nthe  many  Government leaders in every  country  we\r\n\r\nvisited.  What  I propose to do, therefore,  is  to\r\n\r\ngive  a general assessment based on our discussions\r\n\r\nwith  our  East  European  hosts  of  the  kind  of\r\n\r\nrelations we hope to develop over the years between\r\n\r\nthem and ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting for one moment that, as a\r\n\r\nresult  of  this one visit, we have mapped  out  in\r\n\r\ndetail  the  scope and character of  the  relations\r\n\r\nwhich  we hope to develop. This is something  which\r\n\r\nmust   gradually  evolve  in  the  course  of   our\r\n\r\ndealings,  particularly as this is the  first  time\r\n\r\nthat Singapore and the East European countries  are\r\n\r\nbuilding up direct contact with one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when Singapore's foreign relations\r\n\r\nwere  not in our hands, the East European countries\r\n\r\nwere cut off from us by an iron curtain erected not\r\n\r\nby  the  Communists but by those who were  then  in\r\n\r\ncharge  of our foreign relations. It was  no  doubt\r\n\r\nfelt  by  them  that  any  contact  with  Communist\r\n\r\ncountries would be bad for our souls and  bring  us\r\n\r\neternal  damnation.  Partly as  a  result  of  this\r\n\r\npolicy of sheltering us from contact with Communist\r\n\r\ncountries, the Communists too have formed their own\r\n\r\nimage of Singapore as an anti-Communist bastion and\r\n\r\nas an armed base for the protection and furtherance\r\n\r\nof British imperialist interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one immediate and positive result of our visit\r\n\r\nhas  been  to dispel this false image. We  went  to\r\n\r\nEastern Europe as democratic socialists and not  as\r\n\r\nCommunists. What has emerged as a result  of  these\r\n\r\npersonal contacts is that relations between  States\r\n\r\nwith   different  systems  of  government  can   be\r\n\r\nsustained on the basis of mutual respect  and  non-interference in each other's affairs. For our part,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  free and frank discussions we  have  had\r\n\r\nwith  East European leaders, we are satisfied  that\r\n\r\ntrade  and other relations with Communist countries\r\n\r\nimpose no greater or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlesser  trials  and tribulations  than  trade  with\r\n\r\ncapitalist countries. In their discussions with us,\r\n\r\nthe East European leaders stressed that ideological\r\n\r\ndifferences  need  not  be  serious  obstacles   to\r\n\r\nfriendly  political and economic relations  between\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, they drew our attention to\r\n\r\nthe  many trade agreements they had concluded  with\r\n\r\nthe  new  countries of Afro-Asia. They pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat  even  anti-Communist countries  like  Western\r\n\r\nGermany  had  substantial and  growing  trade  with\r\n\r\nthem. As one East European Foreign Minister said to\r\n\r\nus,  \"Trade  knows  no scent and  no  colour.\"  The\r\n\r\nimpression  we  formed was that the  East  European\r\n\r\ncountries, the bulk of whose foreign trade is  with\r\n\r\nCommunist countries, particularly the Soviet Union,\r\n\r\nhave  now  reached a stage of economic  development\r\n\r\nwhere  they feel it advantageous for them  to  seek\r\n\r\ntrade  outlets outside the Communist bloc. In their\r\n\r\ndiscussions with us, their approach to questions of\r\n\r\ntrade  with Singapore was couched in very practical\r\n\r\nand  very  realistic terms. This may have  been  in\r\n\r\npart  due  to  the  frank  and  practical  way   we\r\n\r\napproached the economic relationships which we wish\r\n\r\nto  establish with them. We stressed that  we  were\r\n\r\nnot  asking for aid, but trade. We pointed out that\r\n\r\nSingapore would pay for whatever she gets and  that\r\n\r\nshe  had lived and prospered for over a century  on\r\n\r\nthe  basis of buying at the best prices and selling\r\n\r\nat the lowest. The East Europeans told us that they\r\n\r\nappreciated  not  only  the  business  acumen   and\r\n\r\ntrading experience that Singapore had gathered over\r\n\r\nthe  years as the hub of trade in South-East  Asia,\r\n\r\nbut  also  the sophisticated and delicate  entrepot\r\n\r\ninfrastructure  that  Singapore   has   built   and\r\n\r\ncontinues to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to draw the attention of the\r\n\r\nHouse to a point that was stressed by all the  East\r\n\r\nEuropean  leaders in our discussions with them.  We\r\n\r\ntalked  frankly on trade and political matters.  In\r\n\r\nboth these matters, there is friendly understanding\r\n\r\non different points of view. Understanding does not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean agreement on every point. It means\r\n\r\nthat there can be differing points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof   view   without  there  being   hostility   and\r\n\r\nsuspicion.  We explained why Singapore was  a  non-Communist  socialist country committed  to  a  \r\n\r\nnon-aligned  policy of wanting to be friendly with  all\r\n\r\ncountries.  The  East European  leaders  said  that\r\n\r\ngiven  such  a  policy, satisfactory  and  fruitful\r\n\r\nrelations  could be developed between us and  them.\r\n\r\nAs far as they were concerned, their relations with\r\n\r\nSingapore  would  be founded on  the  principle  of\r\n\r\nmutual  respect, non-interference in one  another's\r\n\r\ninternal   affairs   and   mutual   benefit.   They\r\n\r\nenunciated  this  principle  both  in  our  private\r\n\r\nconversations and in their public statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our belief that, as a result of the visits\r\n\r\nand  discussions,  we have managed  to  dispel  any\r\n\r\nfalse  image  of  Singapore  as  an  anti-Communist\r\n\r\nbastion  and  as  the armed stronghold  of  British\r\n\r\nimperialism. I think we have left the East European\r\n\r\ncountries  with  the impression that  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nessentially  pro-Singapore, and friendly  with  any\r\n\r\ncountry  which  does not resent our furthering  the\r\n\r\nlegitimate  interests of Singapore. The  cordiality\r\n\r\nand respect with which our Mission was received  in\r\n\r\nall  the  five countries of Poland, Czechoslovakia,\r\n\r\nHungary,  Rumania and Bulgaria is a good foundation\r\n\r\nfor our growing relationships. They received us  as\r\n\r\nthe   representatives  of  a  friendly  independent\r\n\r\ncountry,   a   friendly  non-Communist,   socialist\r\n\r\ncountry, with which they wish to establish mutually\r\n\r\nadvantageous  relations. Two  of  these  countries,\r\n\r\nBulgaria  and  Poland,  have already  signed  trade\r\n\r\nagreements  with  us. Czechoslovakia,  Hungary  and\r\n\r\nRumania  have  agreed  to send  trade  missions  to\r\n\r\nSingapore in the very near future. They have  shown\r\n\r\nan   interest  not  only  in  trade  but  also   in\r\n\r\nindustrial projects, facilities for their ships and\r\n\r\nfor  their airplanes, both of whose operations they\r\n\r\nhope  to  expand  in this part of  the  world.  For\r\n\r\nSingapore, these trade and other contacts with East\r\n\r\nEurope mean a diversification and broadening of our\r\n\r\ninternational   trade  and,   therefore,   of   our\r\n\r\ninternational relations. It does not and should not\r\n\r\nmean  abandoning  or displacing our  older  trading\r\n\r\npartners.   It   merely  means  an   extension   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's shop-window in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAsia  by  the addition of goods and customers  from\r\n\r\nthe  Communist world.

The Fund  was  designed  to\r\n\r\nstabilise exchange rates and promote a freer system\r\n\r\nof  world  trade  and payments by assisting  member\r\n\r\ncountries  over  temporary  difficulties  in  their\r\n\r\ninternational balances of payments.  The  Bank  was\r\n\r\nintended primarily to make available capital  which\r\n\r\ncould  not  be  obtained from  private  sources  to\r\n\r\nfinance productive investments in member countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has never had any transaction with the\r\n\r\nInternational  Monetary Fund but has  received  two\r\n\r\nloans from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  -  the  World  Bank  for  short,   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker. The first loan of U.S. $15 million for the\r\n\r\nPasir  Panjang Power Station, Phase I, was received\r\n\r\nin  1963, and the second loan of U.S. $6.5  million\r\n\r\nfor the Johore River Water Project was received  in\r\n\r\n1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is now an independent and sovereign\r\n\r\nnation.  We must become a member of the World  Bank\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Government  or  statutory  bodies  can\r\n\r\nobtain   further  loans.  In  1965,  the  Port   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  Authority successfully  negotiated  with\r\n\r\nthe World Bank for a loan of U.S. $15 million. This\r\n\r\nloan  is  for  the moment held in abeyance  as  the\r\n\r\nagreement for it can only be signed after Singapore\r\n\r\nhas been admitted to the World Bank as a member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One pre-requisite of membership of the World Bank\r\n\r\nis  membership of the International Monetary  Fund.\r\n\r\nIt  is  necessary, therefore, that Singapore should\r\n\r\nalso  be a member of the I.M.F. Membership  of  the\r\n\r\nI.M.F. gives Singapore some advantages. Should  we\r\n\r\nencounter temporary difficulties in our balance  of\r\n\r\npayments  position, we can purchase  the  necessary\r\n\r\ngold or other currencies from the Fund with our own\r\n\r\ncurrency. Otherwise we would probably have to pay a\r\n\r\npremium or institute drastic measures at home which\r\n\r\nmight   have  undesirable  long-term  effects.   By\r\n\r\naccepting the Articles of Agreement of the  I.M.F.,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government will be indicating that it\r\n\r\nwill  abide  by acceptable practices regarding  the\r\n\r\npar value of the currency of Singapore and exchange\r\n\r\ncontrol.   This  will  instil  in  other  countries\r\n\r\nfurther confidence in Singapore. Besides, Singapore\r\n\r\nwill   be  able  to  get  competent  and  objective\r\n\r\nassessments  of  its  own  economy  and  advice  on\r\n\r\neconomic problems from both the Fund and the Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's subscription to the I.M.F. is U.S.\r\n\r\n$30 million of which 25 per cent is payable in gold\r\n\r\nand  the  remainder in local currency.  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsubscription to the Bank, which is a derivative  of\r\n\r\nour  subscription to the Fund, is fixed at U.S. $32\r\n\r\nmillion. Only 10 per cent of this is required to be\r\n\r\npaid  in initially; one per cent to be paid in gold\r\n\r\nor  U.S. dollars, and nine per cent to be paid  in\r\n\r\nlocal currency. In all, Singapore has to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay  U.S.  $7.5 million in gold, U.S.  $320,000  in\r\n\r\ngold  or  U.S, dollars, and U.S. $25.38 million  in\r\n\r\nlocal  currency. Except for a very small  fraction,\r\n\r\nthe  portion  to be paid in local currency  can  be\r\n\r\npaid  in  the  form of non-interest  bearing,  non-negotiable notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of the subscriptions to the Fund and\r\n\r\nthe  Bank deserves a closer examination. So far  as\r\n\r\nthe   Fund  and  the  Bank  are  concerned,   these\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  should  understandably  be   charged\r\n\r\nexpenditure so that the Fund and the Bank would not\r\n\r\nbe subject to further anxiety as regards the actual\r\n\r\npayment  of the subscriptions after the legislation\r\n\r\nhas  been passed. However, it should be noted  that\r\n\r\nthese subscriptions are returnable to the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment either upon the withdrawal of  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  the Fund and the Bank, or upon the winding-up\r\n\r\nof  these Organisations. It can be seen, therefore,\r\n\r\nthat the subscriptions, while not available to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for appropriation so long as  Singapore\r\n\r\nremains  a  member  of the two  Organisations,  are\r\n\r\nreally  different from subscriptions which one  has\r\n\r\nto   pay   when  one  joins  a  private   club   or\r\n\r\nassociation. The subscriptions to the Fund and  the\r\n\r\nBank are a kind of deposit of the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary, Mr Speaker, Sir, for countries\r\n\r\napplying  for membership to be given six months  to\r\n\r\naccept membership of the Fund and the Bank. In  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Singapore,  this period  begins  on  21st\r\n\r\nFebruary,  1966,  which is the date  on  which  the\r\n\r\nBoards  of  Governors  of the  Fund  and  the  Bank\r\n\r\napproved  the  terms and conditions of  Singapore's\r\n\r\nmembership. Subsequently, a considerable amount  of\r\n\r\nadministrative  details had  to  be  considered  as\r\n\r\ndrafting of this Bill proceeded. As a result,  this\r\n\r\nBill  could not be introduced earlier. There are  a\r\n\r\nnumber of formalities still to be carried out, such\r\n\r\nas  the payment of subscriptions, the depositing of\r\n\r\nInstruments of Acceptance, and the signing  of  the\r\n\r\noriginal Articles of Agreement of the Fund and  the\r\n\r\nBank.  These  formalities can only be  carried  out\r\n\r\nafter  this  Bill has become law. It is  for  these\r\n\r\nreasons that this Bill has been introduced under  a\r\n\r\nCertificate of Urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  think  it  is  befitting  the  status   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  as an independent sovereign  country  to\r\n\r\nseek  membership of international bodies  like  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Monetary Fund and the  International\r\n\r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development. Membership\r\n\r\nof  these two international organisations would not\r\n\r\nonly  enhance the status and prestige of Singapore,\r\n\r\nbut  would  also help our development. However,  we\r\n\r\nmust consider whether the price we are called on to\r\n\r\npay  in the form of membership fee is not too  high\r\n\r\nfor  us. We must also consider what benefits we can\r\n\r\nderive  from being a member. There is no  point  in\r\n\r\njoining  an  international  organisation  just  for\r\n\r\nprestige  sake. It may be a luxury which  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan ill afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Bank helps in the financing of specific\r\n\r\nprojects  approved by it, and developing  countries\r\n\r\nlike  Singapore  can  take advantage  of  both  its\r\n\r\nfinancial    and    technical    facilities.    The\r\n\r\nInternational Monetary Fund, on the other hand,  is\r\n\r\nmore  geared to helping developed countries to meet\r\n\r\ntheir  short-term balance of payment  problems  and\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  of much benefit to Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\ndeveloping  nation.  Unfortunately,  as  the   Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister informed us, we cannot become a member  of\r\n\r\none without becoming a member of the other. It is a\r\n\r\ncondition of membership of the World Bank  that  we\r\n\r\nmust  also  be  a member of the I.M.F.  And  it  is\r\n\r\nironical  that membership of the I.M.F. from  which\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  derive  much benefit  should  be  more\r\n\r\nexpensive  than that of the World Bank which  would\r\n\r\nsubstantially  benefit  us.  Although   Singapore's\r\n\r\nsubscription to the World Bank is U.S. $30 million,\r\n\r\n25  per cent of this will have to be paid in  gold.\r\n\r\nThe  balance  of  the money would  have  to  be  in\r\n\r\nSingapore currency.

But  it  would appear from  what  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister has told us that this is not the case;  in\r\n\r\nwhich  case,  it would appear that  the  amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney  tied  up  would  be much  more  than  I  had\r\n\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the World Bank is concerned, that is\r\n\r\nthe   International  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment,  the amount we are asked to  subscribe\r\n\r\nin  gold  is,  in fact, much smaller.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nsubscribe  to  320 shares, each at  U.S.  $100,000,\r\n\r\nmaking a total of U.S. $32 million. But only 20 per\r\n\r\ncent of one-half of the 320 shares are to be called\r\n\r\nup  straightaway and only two per cent of the  half\r\n\r\nof  320  shares are payable in gold. The amount  of\r\n\r\nthe subscription payable, therefore, will only come\r\n\r\nto  one per cent of U.S. $32 million, meaning  U.S.\r\n\r\n$320,000  or about M$1 million. The balance  of  18\r\n\r\nper cent of the half, that is, nine per cent of the\r\n\r\ntotal  U.S. $32 million, is to be paid in  our  own\r\n\r\ncurrency. It will, therefore, follow that about  90\r\n\r\nper  cent of the shares of the World Bank will only\r\n\r\nbe  subject to call, and of this 20 per cent of the\r\n\r\nhalf  called up, 18 per cent is to be  in  our  own\r\n\r\ncurrency. The amount tied up, therefore,  will,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  be quite extensive. The question to be asked\r\n\r\nis,  is  it worthwhile to spend all this amount  of\r\n\r\nmoney?  I think the answer to this question depends\r\n\r\non how much we expect to borrow from the World Bank\r\n\r\nover,  say,  the next five years, and how  easy  it\r\n\r\nwould  be,  and how much more expensive it  is,  to\r\n\r\nborrow from other sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will have tied up in the Bank, as we are\r\n\r\ninformed in the Explanatory Statement to the  Bill,\r\n\r\nsomething  like U.S.$62 million, or something  like M$180\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmillion. If we have all this money tied up, I  fail\r\n\r\nto  see why we cannot, in fact, use it for our  own\r\n\r\ndevelopment  rather than joining  the  World  Bank,\r\n\r\nputting  this  in  as  subscription  and  in   turn\r\n\r\nborrowing money back from the World Bank. No doubt,\r\n\r\nthe  World Bank gives other facilities as well. For\r\n\r\nexample, it offers technical help in the evaluation\r\n\r\nof  projects  which  it is called  on  to  finance.\r\n\r\nHowever,  in  the past, the World  Bank  has  shown\r\n\r\nextreme  conservatism in its  lending  policy.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  it  has only recently been lending  money\r\n\r\nfor water schemes and for educational purposes.  It\r\n\r\ndid  not do so in the past. It is to be hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  World  Bank will now extend its facilities  to\r\n\r\ncover other social development schemes like housing\r\n\r\nand  sewerage. However, should we become a  member,\r\n\r\nit  is also to be hoped that the World Bank will be\r\n\r\nmore  generous  to us in financing local  costs  of\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects.  This  will  enable  certain\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects,  such  as  the  East   Coast\r\n\r\nReclamation, to be financed by the World  Bank.  On\r\n\r\nbalance,  however,  taking into account  the  money\r\n\r\nthat  has  to be tied up, it may, in fact,  be  far\r\n\r\ncheaper for us not to join the World Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to oppose the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nExplanatory Note here under \"Expenditure of  public\r\n\r\nmoney\"  does indicate that our initial subscription\r\n\r\nto  the Fund will be U.S.$62 million, but it is our\r\n\r\ncommitment   rather   than  an  outright   payment.\r\n\r\nInitially,  only ten per cent will be paid  to  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank and 25 per cent to the I.M.F.  I  quite\r\n\r\nagree with the last speaker that if the benefit  we\r\n\r\nare  going to get from joining the I.M.F. and  the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  is  less than having a  sum  of  M$186\r\n\r\nmillion  tied  up,  then  we  should  have   second\r\n\r\nthoughts.

The\r\n\r\npassage  of this Bill was, however, delayed because\r\n\r\nof constitutional difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill embodies (in\r\n\r\nthe  form  of a revised consolidated Act) both  the\r\n\r\nprovisions in the existing law, that is to say, the\r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Ordinance, Chapter 248, as well as\r\n\r\nthe  provisions in the Land Acquisition  (Amendment\r\n\r\nNo.  2)  Bill.  The major departures from  existing\r\n\r\nlegislation are:-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the assessment of compensation provisions\r\n\r\nhave been re-drafted on the basis of two principles\r\n\r\nenunciated by the Prime Minister in December  1963.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  that  no  landowner should  benefit  from\r\n\r\ndevelopment which has taken place at public expense\r\n\r\nand,  secondly, that the price paid on  acquisition\r\n\r\nof  land  for public purposes should not be  higher\r\n\r\nthan  what the land would have been worth  had  the\r\n\r\nGovernment not carried out development generally in\r\n\r\nthe area, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) provision has been made for the hearing of\r\n\r\nappeals by an Appeals Board instead of the Court as\r\n\r\nat present.

The  present penalty is a fine not exceeding\r\n\r\n$500 and in the case of a subsequent conviction,  a\r\n\r\nfine   not  exceeding  $1,000.  In  addition,   the\r\n\r\nmagistrate usually disqualifies the owner  and  the\r\n\r\ndriver  of the car from driving for periods of  one\r\n\r\nto  three years.

Section  79  of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance has not been brought into force  and  the\r\n\r\nPolice have been compounding offences under section\r\n\r\n80  of  the  old Road Traffic Ordinance, Cap.  227.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment  in clause 12 will  regularise  the\r\n\r\npresent  practice of the Police compounding traffic\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to include in\r\n\r\nthe  Bill certain other provisions which would give\r\n\r\nthe authorities more power to tighten up the law in\r\n\r\nrespect  of Malaysian-registered vehicles operating\r\n\r\nin Singapore, some of which are operating as pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis,  and also against vehicles suspected by  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  of  Vehicles  of  having  been  used  or\r\n\r\nintended to be used for unlawful purposes or in  an\r\n\r\nunlawful  manner.  These powers  are,  firstly,  to\r\n\r\nrequire  a Singapore resident using in Singapore  a\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicle  first registered in Malaysia  after\r\n\r\n30th  May  1966 to inform the Registrar of Vehicles\r\n\r\nof  such  use,  and  to provide  the  Registrar  of\r\n\r\nVehicles  powers to change the registration  number\r\n\r\nof  a  vehicle  bearing  a  Malaysian  registration\r\n\r\nnumber, the owner of which is normally resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, to a Singapore registration number. This\r\n\r\nprovision is contained in clause 6 of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another amendment in the Bill prohibits\r\n\r\nresidents of Singapore from possessing or  using  a\r\n\r\nmotor vehicle in respect of which the first licence\r\n\r\nis issued outside Singapore. Such persons would not\r\n\r\nbe  able to use such motor vehicles until such fees\r\n\r\nas  are  required to be paid have been paid to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar.  A  number  of Singapore  residents  are\r\n\r\nbuying their vehicles from Malaysia because of  the\r\n\r\nbetter  discount they can get from Malaysian  motor\r\n\r\ndealers  and subsequently transferring the  vehicle\r\n\r\nand  its  registration to Singapore. This  practice\r\n\r\nresults in Singapore losing revenue in that it does\r\n\r\nnot get the additional registration fee payable  on\r\n\r\nthe   first   registration  of  such  vehicles   if\r\n\r\npurchased   and   registered   in   Singapore,   as\r\n\r\nprescribed in the Motor Vehicles (Registration  and\r\n\r\nLicensing) (Amendment) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRules, 1966.

Provision for appeal to  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nprovided for against the Registrar's decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, in sub-clause (10) of clause 6 of the\r\n\r\nBill,  the Registrar is empowered, if he has reason\r\n\r\nto   believe  that  a  motor  vehicle  licensed  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia has been or is intended to be used for  an\r\n\r\nunlawful  purpose  or  in an  unlawful  manner,  to\r\n\r\nnotify the owner by registered post that the  motor\r\n\r\nvehicle   shall   not   be   used   in   Singapore.\r\n\r\nCorresponding  provision exists  in  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nRoad Traffic Act in respect of vehicles licensed in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the above are the main provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill,  but I would like to point out that clause  5\r\n\r\nis  tied up with clause 6 of the Bill and gives the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  power to allocate Singapore registration\r\n\r\nnumbers  to  vehicles registered in  Singapore  but\r\n\r\nbearing Malaysian registration numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I conclude, I would like to sound a\r\n\r\nword  of  warning  to  pirate taxi  operators  that\r\n\r\naction  will be taken against them if they continue\r\n\r\nto  pursue their illegal activities after this Bill\r\n\r\nbecomes law. I hope those concerned will take  heed\r\n\r\nof this warning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of the House\r\n\r\nto the Report by the Milton Tan Committee which has\r\n\r\nbeen tabled in Parliament today. This Committee was\r\n\r\nset up to review the position of licensing of taxis\r\n\r\nand   taxi   drivers   in  Singapore.   Among   its\r\n\r\nrecommendations  is a scheme to  license  at  least\r\n\r\n4,000  private  motor vehicles as school  taxis  to\r\n\r\nferry school children to and from schools. These\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschool  taxis  will  be licensed  only  for  school\r\n\r\nchildren  and will be required to provide insurance\r\n\r\ncover  for  their passengers, to be subject  to  an\r\n\r\nannual inspection by the Vehicles Department and to\r\n\r\ncarry a special identification mark. They will also\r\n\r\nhave to pay a licence fee of $2 per month. The date\r\n\r\nwhen applications will be received for school taxis\r\n\r\nand  other details will be announced later.

The Committee felt  that\r\n\r\nthe  present  number  of  licensed  taxis  may   be\r\n\r\nincreased by 300 in view of the following -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the bus services not being sufficient for the\r\n\r\nwhole Republic;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the opening up and development of new housing\r\n\r\nestates  by private developers and the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the increase in population;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) many of the taxi drivers have difficulty in\r\n\r\nfinding a taxi to drive; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) the increased number of tourists visiting\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>The  date will also be announced later as  to  when\r\n\r\napplications  for  these additional  taxis  can  be\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, a number of amendments have been\r\n\r\nmade  which  have  been rendered necessary  by  the\r\n\r\nconstitutional   changes  in  Singapore   and   its\r\n\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nrelief will be felt all round at the passing of the\r\n\r\nRoad Traffic (Amendment) Bill into law.

In the first place,  I\r\n\r\nshould  like to say that it was their demand  which\r\n\r\ngave  rise to the pirate taxi business, although  I\r\n\r\nread  in  the newspaper that the President  of  the\r\n\r\nTaxi Hire Car Association, Mr Simon, said that the\r\n\r\npirate taxi problem has been existing for 20 years.\r\n\r\nIt  seems to me that he said nothing at all in  the\r\n\r\npresent context. It was no problem then, but now it\r\n\r\nhas  become a problem of some dimension and  action\r\n\r\nhas  had to be taken, and further a solution sought\r\n\r\nnot by just giving the history of the existence  of\r\n\r\npirate taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to congratulate\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State for the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nDepartment   on  introducing  this   Road   Traffic\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill  which,  when  passed   by   this\r\n\r\nLegislature  and incorporated in the  Road  Traffic\r\n\r\nOrdinance, will remove the ambiguities in the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic Ordinance, 1961, and also put an end to the\r\n\r\npirate taxi menace in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through the relevant clauses of this\r\n\r\nBill  and it was with great pleasure that  I  noted\r\n\r\nfrom the relevant clauses that in future it will be\r\n\r\nextremely  difficult  for  the  pirate  taxi  which\r\n\r\nappears to have invaded the city traffic to a great\r\n\r\nextent  to continue reaping illegal profits at  the\r\n\r\nexpense of the licensed taxis and buses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this pirate taxi problem\r\n\r\nessentially  consists of two evils. First  of  all,\r\n\r\nthe  owners  of  cars registered in  Malaysia  have\r\n\r\ninvaded  our city traffic with a view to earning  a\r\n\r\nliving  at the expense of our own citizens.  If  we\r\n\r\nmove around the city streets, we can observe pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis  with  Malaysian number  plates  plying,  the\r\n\r\ndrivers'  eyes  glued  to the  pedestrians  with  a\r\n\r\ndesire to attracting them to their taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to hear from the Minister of State\r\n\r\nthat  steps have been taken to increase the  number\r\n\r\nof  licensed  taxis, but in taking these  necessary\r\n\r\nsteps to increase the number of licensed taxis,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would  like to draw the attention of this  House\r\n\r\nthat  once  the  issuance of  taxi  licences  takes\r\n\r\nplace,  the  Registrar of Vehicles must turn  every\r\n\r\nstone to ensure that the new taxis do not fall into\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of the small-time capitalists  who  own\r\n\r\nseveral  vehicles  and  who  make  their  money  by\r\n\r\nrenting  out  these cars. On the  other  hand,  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar  must ensure that the new taxis  go  into\r\n\r\nthe  hands  of  the vast number of registered  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  who, for want of a vehicle of  their  own,\r\n\r\nare  forced  to  hire  taxis  from  the  small-time\r\n\r\ncapitalists,   in  which  case  they   suffer   the\r\n\r\nexploitation of having to part with a heavy payment\r\n\r\nfrom  their earnings as hire for the vehicles. This\r\n\r\nis  important, Sir. If the Registrar fails to bring\r\n\r\nabout  a fair distribution and, on the other  hand,\r\n\r\nindifferently allows the concentration of  vehicles\r\n\r\nin the hands of a few, he will be going against the\r\n\r\ntide of a socialist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect. Though taxis must be given\r\n\r\nto  the hundreds of taxi drivers who are not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to buy their own vehicles because of their\r\n\r\nincapacity, are they to continue to be exploited by\r\n\r\nthe  vehicle owners? I have the intention to  raise\r\n\r\nthis  matter  with the Government with  a  view  to\r\n\r\nappealing  to the Government to form a co-operative\r\n\r\nsociety  with Government assistance to enable  them\r\n\r\nto  possess  their own vehicles.  The  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  has  been especially interested  in  this\r\n\r\nproblem and anxious to end exploitation of the kind\r\n\r\nmentioned  earlier, and we have been interested  in\r\n\r\nbringing  about a situation where taxis are  manned\r\n\r\nby  owner-operators. If the Government works  along\r\n\r\nthe  lines indicated by ensuring that taxis are  so\r\n\r\ndistributed  that  the situation is  brought  about\r\n\r\nwhere  there is one owner to a taxi, it will  be  a\r\n\r\nfeather in the cap of our socialist Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fervently hope, Sir, that interest will be\r\n\r\ntaken  in  the formation of a co-operative  society\r\n\r\nwith  the  principal function of helping  the  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  to own their own vehicles and to bring  to\r\n\r\nan  end their exploitation which is quite naked  in\r\n\r\nthis sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I feel that the Bill  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced in Parliament today is a Bill which\r\n\r\nreally affects the public of our country. I believe\r\n\r\nthat it certainly has good intentions, that is,  to\r\n\r\nsafeguard our country from being a country  without\r\n\r\nlaws or without procedure. However, in a matter  of\r\n\r\nthis nature, we must consider all aspects. Firstly,\r\n\r\nthe  taxi  drivers;  secondly, the  bus  companies;\r\n\r\nthirdly,  members of the public, including  adults,\r\n\r\noffice   workers,  women  going  marketing,  school\r\n\r\nchildren; and fourthly, the unemployed. I  am  sure\r\n\r\nunemployed persons will find ways and means to earn\r\n\r\na  living  and, in their opinion, they can  earn  a\r\n\r\nliving by driving pirate taxis. To me, if a country\r\n\r\nis  short of buses, bus routes, or taxis, or if the\r\n\r\ntaxis or buses are untidy and the roads are narrow,\r\n\r\nwe  can  say that that country has not got adequate\r\n\r\nlaws. We must have an open mind on how we can adopt\r\n\r\nthese  laws  so that the citizens may benefit  from\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in Paper Misc. 3 of 1966, the Report\r\n\r\nof  the Committee to Review the Licensing of  Taxis\r\n\r\nand  Taxi Drivers, the Committee only recommends  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  300  additional taxis.  Statistics  were\r\n\r\nobtained   from  cities  like  Bangkok,   Hongkong,\r\n\r\nManila, London, Queensland Australia, and the Malay\r\n\r\nStates.  I  believe that, apart  from  Malaya,  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of those countries mentioned  is\r\n\r\nhigh  and that enables the people to own their  own\r\n\r\ncars or to run adequate buses. Perhaps in countries\r\n\r\nlike  London,  we understand that  in  addition  to\r\n\r\ntaxis  and  buses, there are underground  rail  and\r\n\r\nmonorail services. Perhaps that is an effort on the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Government concerned to improve  the\r\n\r\ntransport system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in contrast, in the whole of Malaya\r\n\r\nthere  are  5,245  taxis with  a  population  of  7\r\n\r\nmillion. We cannot compare Malaya with Singapore on\r\n\r\nthe  ground  that  Malaya, with a population  of  7\r\n\r\nmillion,  has  hundreds of small  towns,  excepting\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur,  Penang,  Ipoh,  and  Seremban,  for\r\n\r\nexample, which do not have any use for taxis as  we\r\n\r\ndo  in  Singapore. Therefore, it is impossible  for\r\n\r\nthis Committee to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsider  all these factors because, as  stated  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State, with the  development  of\r\n\r\nhousing  estates  by  private  developers  and  the\r\n\r\nHousing   and  Development  Board,  we  must   also\r\n\r\nconsider  that  the increase of 300 taxis  must  be\r\n\r\nraised.  As  I said, we cannot compare  with  those\r\n\r\ncountries that I enumerated just now. Conditions in\r\n\r\nMalaya differ from those obtaining in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, services by road, rail, and\r\n\r\naeroplane   all  differ.  Bus  services   and   the\r\n\r\noperation of taxis and pirate taxis differ one from\r\n\r\nthe other. For instance, in the case of buses, they\r\n\r\nrun  along  fixed or determined routes  and  cannot\r\n\r\nstop  anywhere other than at specified  bus  stops.\r\n\r\nPirate taxis ply according to their own routes  and\r\n\r\nthey  may  stop wherever they like. Sometimes  they\r\n\r\neven  stop when the traffic lights are red in order\r\n\r\nto  set down their passengers. There are two  types\r\n\r\nof  taxis  in  Singapore. One  is  the  taxi  which\r\n\r\nfollows the rules of the Registrar of Vehicles, and\r\n\r\nthe other which follows the pirate taxi rules. This\r\n\r\nmeans  that taxis following the rules of the R.O.V.\r\n\r\nply  their business along routes which differ  from\r\n\r\nthe bus routes and the routes of pirate taxis. They\r\n\r\npick up passengers at one place and go according to\r\n\r\nthe directions of the passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Committee's Report\r\n\r\nreferred  to,  there is reference  made  to  61,000\r\n\r\nschool children using pirate taxis. Because of  the\r\n\r\ngreat  number of children, the Committee recommends\r\n\r\nthat  licences be issued to what are termed by  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  as  \"school  taxis\"  or  \"private  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles  licensed to carry school  children\".  Why\r\n\r\ncannot  this  Committee make a  recommendation  for\r\n\r\nseparate licences as, for instance, office workers'\r\n\r\ntaxis,  taxis for people going to market, or  taxis\r\n\r\nfor people living in areas without buses? This is a\r\n\r\ncomplicated matter. In issuing special licences  to\r\n\r\ntaxis to carry the 61,000 school children alone, we\r\n\r\nmust  also  consider the views of  other  transport\r\n\r\noperators  because the Committee is of the  opinion\r\n\r\nthat  buses  are  insufficient. I also  think  that\r\n\r\noffice  workers  in  town  are  not  supplied  with\r\n\r\nadequate bus services and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey feel that they should come to office by pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we allow taxis to run according to pirate taxi\r\n\r\nrules, I am sure that, for the purpose of enforcing\r\n\r\nthe   law  with  good  intentions,  we  should  not\r\n\r\nimplement  it, and that to regularise the  position\r\n\r\nin  our  country  we  must be open-minded  and  not\r\n\r\nrestrict or confine ourselves to one sector of  the\r\n\r\npopulation alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention is also made in the Report that most of\r\n\r\nthe  drivers  have a little knowledge of  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of tourism. I am sure that because\r\n\r\nof  the  rapid  developments taking  place  in  our\r\n\r\ncountry, that has nothing to do with the Bill under\r\n\r\ndiscussion today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we should also find out the\r\n\r\nreason  why,  in  addition to the  matters  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned   earlier  on,  the  bus   companies   as\r\n\r\nmentioned  in  the Report do not  wish  to  provide\r\n\r\nspecial   bus   services  because  of  uneconomical\r\n\r\ngrounds.  What is surprising to me is that  if  the\r\n\r\nBill is passed without an open mind considering it,\r\n\r\nI am afraid that the attitude of bus companies will\r\n\r\nbe  this, \"If I do not make a profit, then I do not\r\n\r\ncare  what happens to you.\" If this is the attitude\r\n\r\nof  bus  companies,  we should not  adopt  a  civil\r\n\r\nattitude. We cannot support that attitude. We  must\r\n\r\nfind  ways  and  means to enable bus  companies  to\r\n\r\noperate  for the benefit of the public, for  school\r\n\r\nchildren,  and so on. The reason why parents  allow\r\n\r\ntheir   children  to  use  pirate  taxis  is  this.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  the  safety of their children;  secondly,\r\n\r\nthe distance from their homes to the bus stand; and\r\n\r\nthirdly,  they  have  to change  buses  frequently,\r\n\r\nwhich takes time and also cost more in fares.  This\r\n\r\nmust  be considered as widely as possible. That  is\r\n\r\nall, Mr Speaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.59 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I would like to support this Bill and\r\n\r\nalso   to   congratulate  the   Minister   on   his\r\n\r\ninitiative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to ask the Minister for an\r\n\r\nassurance  that  just  passing  this  Bill  is  not\r\n\r\nenough,  but  to  see  that  the  Bill  is   really\r\n\r\nenforced.  Secondly, just curbing the pirate  taxis\r\n\r\nwill not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreally  solve this problem. With the expansion  of\r\n\r\nthe   Republic  and  especially  of  the   housing\r\n\r\nestates,  more licensed taxis should be introduced\r\n\r\nto cater for the needs of the public, particularly\r\n\r\nschool  children living in housing  estates  where\r\n\r\nbuses  are not available. I should like to suggest\r\n\r\nthat  Government  introduce a  type  of  transport\r\n\r\nwhere it will cater only for school children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While appreciating the Bill to curb these pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis,  the  Government should also  consider  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  school-going children. At the  moment\r\n\r\nthese children depend for their transport on these\r\n\r\npirate taxis. When I say transport, Mr Speaker, I\r\n\r\nmean  cheap transport. There should be a  form  of\r\n\r\ncheap,   legalised   transport  for   school-going\r\n\r\nchildren.  To ease their difficulties  during  the\r\n\r\ntransition   period,  I  would  suggest   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  introduce  a  co-operative  scheme\r\n\r\nwhereby  these taxi-drivers would be able  to  own\r\n\r\ntheir  own vehicles one day and, at the same time,\r\n\r\nprovide  cheaper  transport  for  children.  These\r\n\r\ntaxis  carrying school-going children, on the  co-operative scheme introduced by Government,  should\r\n\r\ncarry  a  plate  openly  on display,  \"For  school\r\n\r\nchildren only\" and levy charges at a very  special\r\n\r\nrate.  If the Government is prepared to float  the\r\n\r\ncapital  for  this co-operative scheme,  a  driver\r\n\r\nwould  be  able to save about 50 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\nrent of the vehicle in a month, which will come to\r\n\r\nabout  $280. Perhaps, Mr Speaker, you may not  be\r\n\r\naware  of  what I really mean when I say a  driver\r\n\r\nwould save about $280 a month. Take, for instance,\r\n\r\na  driver  who  rents a vehicle  from  the  blood-sucking vampire at about $17 per day or about $500\r\n\r\nper  month.  The driver gets his own vehicle  from\r\n\r\nthe co-operative society on an instalment basis of\r\n\r\nabout  $220  per month. This enables him  to  save\r\n\r\nabout  $280 per month. He should then be  able  to\r\n\r\nsay  that he robs from the rich and gives  to  the\r\n\r\npoor and that he is a Robin Hood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand why the Taxi Owners Association\r\n\r\nis  against  the  increase of  more  taxis.  These\r\n\r\nowners are not used to a socialist society, or any\r\n\r\nsociety other than a capitalist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  should like the Government here to introduce  a\r\n\r\nBill whereby there will be a maximum of about  $10\r\n\r\na  day  rent  on  any  taxi for  taxi  drivers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  By this, Mr Speaker, I am,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ndoing a favour to the fat capitalists who will  be\r\n\r\nable to join our society, a socialist society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, while appreciating the unemployment\r\n\r\nmarket,  I would appeal to the Minister really  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  difficulties of the  pirate  taxi\r\n\r\ndrivers  so  as  to be able to fit them  into  our\r\n\r\nsociety.

Singapore  is  now   an\r\n\r\nindependent  sovereign country and,  as  such,  we\r\n\r\nshould  have  discipline and ordered life  in  the\r\n\r\ncountry. Therefore, we cannot allow certain people\r\n\r\nto  come out of the purviews of the existing  law.\r\n\r\nThe  problem of pirate taxis is a good example  to\r\n\r\nillustrate  my  point.  But  in  order  to   adopt\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  achieve the purpose, we should  also\r\n\r\nconsider  carefully  how to go  about  it  and  to\r\n\r\nconsider its causes. The existence of pirate taxis\r\n\r\nis  also  something that we should consider.  Just\r\n\r\nnow  the  Minister of State has said  that  it  is\r\n\r\nrecommended by the Milton Tan Committee that it is\r\n\r\nnecessary to have 4,000 more taxis to carry school\r\n\r\nchildren  and he has also said that the number  of\r\n\r\npirate taxis is about 7,000. It is really alarming\r\n\r\nthat pirate taxis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nhave  increased  to  such an extent.  It  has  been\r\n\r\npartly  due to Indonesian confrontation,  resulting\r\n\r\nin  some people having to resort to other means  of\r\n\r\nlivelihood. Some people have to resort  to  running\r\n\r\npirate taxis for their livelihood, and others  have\r\n\r\nto  resort  to other means of livelihood,  such  as\r\n\r\nhawking.  Now  that Indonesia has awakened  to  the\r\n\r\nrealities  of  the situation, and  as  she  is  now\r\n\r\nproceeding to resume trade relationships  with  us,\r\n\r\nthe   situation  will  improve;  nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  pirate  taxis  needs  some  time   to\r\n\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the law in this respect has been passed,\r\n\r\nwhat  will happen to the livelihood of these  7,000\r\n\r\npirate taxi drivers? Of course, on the one hand, we\r\n\r\nhave  to maintain law and order in the country but,\r\n\r\non  the  other, we cannot overlook or neglect  this\r\n\r\npractical  question of their livelihood. Therefore,\r\n\r\nI  would like to propose three suggestions  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which are as follows.  The  Government,\r\n\r\nwhile  implementing  this  law,  should  also  warn\r\n\r\nproprietors of public transport companies that they\r\n\r\nshould not neglect their duty to help in running  a\r\n\r\ntransport service for the people, and not just  for\r\n\r\nthe  sake  of  their  own  profits.  In  the  past,\r\n\r\nsometimes  because  of their own selfishness,  they\r\n\r\nhad   caused  difficulties  in  regard  to   public\r\n\r\ntransportation and, because of these  difficulties,\r\n\r\npirate taxis came into being. Therefore, this is  a\r\n\r\npoint  that the Government should pay attention  to\r\n\r\nwhile implementing the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is, I think, that during the\r\n\r\ntime  when  the  law  is being  implemented,  there\r\n\r\nshould  be a spirit of compromise so that when  the\r\n\r\nlaw  is  passed, pirate taxis will not try  to  run\r\n\r\naway  from  the law and cause a shortage of  public\r\n\r\ntransport in some areas and cause inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nthe public. Whether under the present law there  is\r\n\r\nroom  for such compromise or not is a matter to  be\r\n\r\nconsidered.  There  should also be  a  governmental\r\n\r\nsolution  to this problem which will be  acceptable\r\n\r\nto all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the law should not be\r\n\r\nimplemented  hastily in regard  to  the  number  of\r\n\r\npirate taxis to be legalised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that in my area there are a  lot\r\n\r\nof  poor  people. They have difficulty  in  getting\r\n\r\ntransport.   Pirate   taxi  operators   also   have\r\n\r\ndifficulties in meeting the hire purchase  payments\r\n\r\nfor  their  cars. As they are poor, sometimes  they\r\n\r\ncannot  pay up the instalments and their  cars  are\r\n\r\nthen confiscated, thus threatening their livelihood\r\n\r\nwhich would involve not just a matter of their  own\r\n\r\nlivelihood but also their dependants, because  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  look after their family whilst  they  are\r\n\r\ncontinuing to pay for the cars they are running  as\r\n\r\npirate  taxis.  Therefore,  there  should  be  some\r\n\r\nflexibility in the law, such as allowing them, say,\r\n\r\nsix  months'  grace  to pay up  their  instalments,\r\n\r\nafter  which the Government can take steps to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  them, or perhaps the period can be up to  one\r\n\r\nyear.  At least there should be some room for  them\r\n\r\nto  manoeuvre  or  to enable them  to  pay  up  the\r\n\r\ninstalments for their cars so that they  would  not\r\n\r\nhave  any burden on their livelihood. These are  my\r\n\r\npersonal views.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> I would also like to\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the Minister of State for  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  Department on this  amendment  Bill.  I\r\n\r\nthink this Chamber will agree with me that law  and\r\n\r\norder  must be kept, as the Minister of  State  has\r\n\r\nstated  just  now. I must also very highly  commend\r\n\r\nhim  on  taking into consideration the question  of\r\n\r\nregularising   pirate  taxis  which  carry   school\r\n\r\nchildren   to  school.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   this\r\n\r\nregularisation will give confidence to parents  who\r\n\r\nare  concerned  with the safety of  their  children\r\n\r\nwhile  going  to and from school. This  is  a  good\r\n\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Minister to enlighten me on\r\n\r\nwhether  the  regularisation of these pirate  taxis\r\n\r\ncarrying   school   children   will   include,   as\r\n\r\npassengers, members of the public, such as  clerks,\r\n\r\nmanual workers and odd job workers. As you know, it\r\n\r\nis  a  recognised fact in the whole world that  our\r\n\r\nhousing estates are expanding, whether it is by the\r\n\r\nHousing   and  Development  Board  or  by   private\r\n\r\ndevelopers and we have to consider that the  number\r\n\r\nof  buses running on the road is not enough for our\r\n\r\nincreasing population. Sir, my suggestion  is  that\r\n\r\nwe must include in this licence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers  like  teachers and others. I  fully  agree\r\n\r\nthat curbing these pirate taxis will naturally ease\r\n\r\nour  traffic problem. Sir, as I have said just now,\r\n\r\nwith  the  increase in population, the shortage  of\r\n\r\ntransport  and  so  on, only  300  additional  taxi\r\n\r\nlicences  will  be given. Sir, we think  there  are\r\n\r\nabout  7,000 pirate taxis running in Singapore.  As\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Delta has said just now, if we take\r\n\r\naway  something, we must substitute  something  for\r\n\r\nit.  Therefore,  I sincerely urge the  Minister  to\r\n\r\nconsider this point. At the same time, I must  warn\r\n\r\nthat  amending the Ordinance does not mean that  we\r\n\r\nare protecting the bosses of bus companies and taxi\r\n\r\nowners.  The  workers and their  bosses  must  give\r\n\r\nfirst-class  service to the public.  I  think  this\r\n\r\nHouse  will agree with me that many of these  buses\r\n\r\nare  driven  along  the roads in  a  very  careless\r\n\r\nmanner  and they endanger the lives of the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  does not mean that this  Bill  will\r\n\r\nprotect the bosses of bus companies and taxi owners\r\n\r\nand  they can do whatever they like. They must  co-operate and give efficient and satisfactory service\r\n\r\nto our people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  gone  through  the Road  Traffic  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.  It  appears to me that there is  not  enough\r\n\r\nprovision  in  the  Bill for  the  benefit  of  the\r\n\r\npeople,  but  it  seems to me to  impose  an  extra\r\n\r\nburden  on  the  people. In  this  connection,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment must seek an alternative solution. There\r\n\r\nshould  be  no  ill-effects on  the  people.  There\r\n\r\nshould  be  other constructive means.  That  is  my\r\n\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Singapore is increasing and if\r\n\r\nthe  transport system is not efficient, there  will\r\n\r\nbe  difficulties.  The  Government  must  take  the\r\n\r\nnecessary steps to see that the people are not over-burdened  and  that  they are  well  looked  after.\r\n\r\nTherefore,    they   should   increase    transport\r\n\r\nfacilities.  Only then will there be a solution.  I\r\n\r\nurge them to take the necessary steps to solve this\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  changing of laws, the imposition  of\r\n\r\n$1,000  fines  or  three  years'  imprisonment  and\r\n\r\nheavier  penalties will not lead us to  any  proper\r\n\r\nsolution. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nit  is  the Government's bounden duty to look after\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of the people. We must find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans which will benefit the people in future.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  make  appropriate   laws.   The\r\n\r\nincrease    in   population   will   bring    about\r\n\r\ndifficulties in the transport situation. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe  should  see  that proper remedies  are  brought\r\n\r\nabout  if we want our country to progress. We  have\r\n\r\nintroduced  this  Bill today, but  I  have  certain\r\n\r\ndoubts  as  to  whether it will  bring  about  good\r\n\r\nresults. Therefore, if there are difficulties,  the\r\n\r\nlaw  may  be  changed.  I  feel  that  there  is  a\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  the  Government to  reconsider  the\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I am very glad to see this Bill which\r\n\r\nhas  been introduced to amend the Ordinance. I also\r\n\r\nhope  to  see  more legal taxis  on  the  roads  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  If  there are more licences  issued  to\r\n\r\ntaxis,  it  will be easier to solve  the  transport\r\n\r\ndifficulties. The question of pirate taxis  is  not\r\n\r\nonly  a legal problem but also an economic problem.\r\n\r\nI do not oppose the idea that Singapore should be a\r\n\r\ncountry  where there is law and order, but in  view\r\n\r\nof   the   question  of  pirate   taxis   and   the\r\n\r\nmultifarious questions which affect the  livelihood\r\n\r\nof  thousands  of  people, practical  consideration\r\n\r\nshould  be given to the solution of these problems.\r\n\r\nOur  law  may  solve some problems  but  if,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the economic situation relating  to  these\r\n\r\nproblems  is  not solved, then it may  lead  to  an\r\n\r\nundesirable  situation. I hope that this  law  will\r\n\r\nnot  cause more economic problems. I also hope that\r\n\r\nwhen  this law is passed, the Government will adopt\r\n\r\nmore  practical  measures to resolve  the  economic\r\n\r\nproblems of pirate taxi drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I hope to be able to get some\r\n\r\nexplanation from the Minister concerned with regard\r\n\r\nto the time when more legal licences are issued. We\r\n\r\nshould  not  expect  the issuance  of  licences  to\r\n\r\ncreate  more people in the bourgeois class  and  to\r\n\r\nmake the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is a\r\n\r\nproblem to which we have to pay attention. In other\r\n\r\nwords,  the  issuance of such licences  should  not\r\n\r\nbring  about  such a situation. In our  socialistic\r\n\r\ncountry, we should not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  measures which will lead to a situation where\r\n\r\nthe rich will become richer and the poor poorer. On\r\n\r\nthis  point,  I  would  like to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is not necessary to set up  a  special\r\n\r\nCommittee to study this matter. I do not mean  that\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar of Vehicles is incompetent or always\r\n\r\nperfect   or  infallible.  Therefore,  a  Committee\r\n\r\nshould  be  appointed  to  help  him  resolve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just\r\n\r\nwant  to  get some clarification from the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned.   In  the  Report  of  the  Milton   Tan\r\n\r\nCommittee  - the section on the proposed  licensing\r\n\r\nof  private motor vehicles to carry school children\r\n\r\nonly  for profit -- from the wording, I assume that\r\n\r\nonly school children will be carried. I know for  a\r\n\r\nfact that at the moment there are some teachers  or\r\n\r\nschool  clerks  who go with children  in  the  same\r\n\r\nmotor  vehicles.  But if only school  children  are\r\n\r\nallowed to be carried as passengers in this type of\r\n\r\nvehicle,  did the Committee go into the details  of\r\n\r\nthe  economic factors involved? Now how many school\r\n\r\nchildren can a motor vehicle carry? At the  moment,\r\n\r\n10,  12  or 15 children are squeezed into one  car,\r\n\r\nbut  I  suppose  when the taxis are licensed,  they\r\n\r\nwill  not be able to do that. So probably each  car\r\n\r\nwill  be able to carry six or seven school children\r\n\r\nfor  one session. So for two sessions, one car will\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  carry an average of 12 or  14  school\r\n\r\nchildren. But if each school child were to  pay  an\r\n\r\naverage of $12 per month, then the owner-driver  of\r\n\r\nsuch  a  type of vehicle would be able to  have  an\r\n\r\nincome  of  about $150 a month. Now  these  drivers\r\n\r\nhave  to pay $2 a month for the licence fee  and  I\r\n\r\nwonder how much they are going to pay for insurance\r\n\r\ncover  for passengers! If they are allowed to carry\r\n\r\nonly  school children, as I said earlier, they  can\r\n\r\nonly  carry  about 14 school children a  day  seven\r\n\r\nboys  or girls in the morning session and seven  in\r\n\r\nthe  afternoon  session.  So  that  means  that  14\r\n\r\nchildren  will  be  paying to  the  owner  of  that\r\n\r\nvehicle.  He has to pay $2 a month for the  licence\r\n\r\nfee. Now how much he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  to pay for insurance cover, I do not know.  So\r\n\r\nif  such  a type of vehicle is limited to  carrying\r\n\r\nonly  school  children, would it be profitable,  or\r\n\r\nwould the operator earn enough for a living?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam  very much impressed today because the Bill  has\r\n\r\ncreated interest among hon. Members. This is  right\r\n\r\nand proper, because transport is our major problem,\r\n\r\nas has been pointed out by several hon. Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have considered this problem from all angles\r\n\r\nfor  the benefit of our country. However, we  admit\r\n\r\nthat  in the implementation of the Bill we may face\r\n\r\ntrials  and  tribulations, but in the  interest  of\r\n\r\npeace  and for the benefit of the majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople,  we  are  obliged to take somewhat  drastic\r\n\r\nmeasures because it was during the period when  the\r\n\r\nR.O.V. was under Malaysia that the number of pirate\r\n\r\ntaxis was on the increase. We consider it essential\r\n\r\nthat an amendment be made to curb the activities of\r\n\r\npirate taxi operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful to certain Members of the House who\r\n\r\nhave  put forward constructive suggestions. One  of\r\n\r\nthe  suggestions  coming from the Member  for  Bras\r\n\r\nBasah  is  a request that the issuance of  licences\r\n\r\ndoes  not fall into the hands of small capitalists.\r\n\r\nIt  is  the responsibility of my Ministry  to  give\r\n\r\nserious  consideration to this matter. I feel  that\r\n\r\ncertain  Members are anxious that  when  action  is\r\n\r\ntaken against these pirate taxi operators, it  will\r\n\r\nmean a step backwards in the transport system.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  that in the interim period we are obliged\r\n\r\nto  take this measure because, in the past, when we\r\n\r\nasked  for  extension of a bus service  in  certain\r\n\r\nareas,  the bus company concerned turned  down  the\r\n\r\nrequest  on uneconomical grounds. With the  curbing\r\n\r\nof pirate taxi activities, the bus companies should\r\n\r\nhave no reason not to extend their services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the suggestion of the Member for Delta\r\n\r\nthat the enforcement of this Bill should be held in\r\n\r\nabeyance  for  six months or a year,  I  think  the\r\n\r\nquestion of eliminating pirate taxi activities  was\r\n\r\nfirst  talked about long ago, and the response  was\r\n\r\nthat more pirate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaxis came on to the road, and ample time was given\r\n\r\nto these operators to find alternative means of\r\n\r\nlivelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the request from the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  to the Minister for Health, the  Members\r\n\r\nfor  Kampong  Kapor, Changi, and so  on,  was  that\r\n\r\npirate taxis be allowed to carry office workers and\r\n\r\nadults.  It is difficult to distinguish between  an\r\n\r\noffice  worker  and  an ordinary  person  hiring  a\r\n\r\npirate  taxi.  I  think  this  request  cannot   be\r\n\r\nconsidered at this stage. Likewise, the question of\r\n\r\nteachers being included in the definition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of how many children can be carried\r\n\r\nin  a licensed pirate taxi will be announced later,\r\n\r\nbut  at the moment, what I can propose is the ratio\r\n\r\nof  two  adults  to  three children,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nmaximum  a  car  can carry is seven passengers.  We\r\n\r\nmust ensure the safety of school children should an\r\n\r\naccident  occur.  Talking  as  fathers,  we  should\r\n\r\nensure the safety of our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of profit and loss, the matter\r\n\r\nhas   been  considered  at  great  length  by   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  which  has  put  up  this  Report  after\r\n\r\nhearing many representations from associations like\r\n\r\nthe  association  representing taxis  which  has  a\r\n\r\nmembership   of   800  members   at   the   moment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on the whole, I am grateful  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  for  all  the  views and  suggestions  put\r\n\r\nforward.

It is in the best interest of\r\n\r\nmoulding our multi-racial and multi-lingual society\r\n\r\ninto a common group of patriotic citizens. This\r\n\r\nsystem\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  give an opportunity to the various  races  to\r\n\r\npreserve  and safeguard their own cultural heritage\r\n\r\nhanded through generations by learning their mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  and  help  develop  a  common  ground   of\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between  one  another  through   the\r\n\r\ncommon and national language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tamil language has a long history of the past\r\n\r\nand is considered to be one of the oldest languages\r\n\r\nin  the world. It has an unbroken length of history\r\n\r\nof 5,000 years old. The Tamil community, although a\r\n\r\nminority  group in this country, are very  grateful\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government's initiative and encouragement\r\n\r\nby making Tamil as one of the official languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are 14 Tamil primary schools and one\r\n\r\nsecondary  school  in Singapore.  Out  of  14,  two\r\n\r\nprimary schools are run by Government and the other\r\n\r\n12  are aided schools. However, there is a tendency\r\n\r\namong the public and the community that the present\r\n\r\ncurriculum  in  Tamil schools falls  short  of  the\r\n\r\nrequired  need. The same could be said about  Tamil\r\n\r\nas a second language in English schools. It is felt\r\n\r\nthat  improvements could be achieved by  increasing\r\n\r\nthe number of teaching hours and periods to include\r\n\r\nlanguage, literature and grammar classes which  are\r\n\r\nthe fundamentals for a better and improved study of\r\n\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, English as a second language in Tamil\r\n\r\nschools is a vital necessity at the present moment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  a few politicians may say that English  is\r\n\r\nthe  leftover  of  the past colonial  masters.  But\r\n\r\nungrudgingly, it has become the language of  living\r\n\r\nin this part of the world at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am quoting correctly, the standard of\r\n\r\nEnglish in the only Tamil secondary school  is  not\r\n\r\nup  to the required need, so much so that a student\r\n\r\nwho  passed  a Tamil secondary education  from  the\r\n\r\nUmar  Pulawar Secondary School is only fit to be  a\r\n\r\nTamil  teacher  in any of the Tamil schools.  Thus,\r\n\r\nthe  scope  of their employment in other fields  is\r\n\r\nremote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remedy could be by improving English\r\n\r\neducation in the Tamil schools\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  general and raising the standard of English in\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil  secondary school  to  Secondary  IV  or\r\n\r\nCambridge Certificate level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the main theme of our Government's\r\n\r\neducational policy is to infuse national unity  and\r\n\r\nunderstanding among the various races of this  tiny\r\n\r\nRepublic, the bold step taken by the Government  in\r\n\r\nintroducing the integrated schools system  is  very\r\n\r\nmuch  appreciated. By this system it is  understood\r\n\r\nthat  pupils of two different language streams  mix\r\n\r\ntogether  and  share the same school building,  the\r\n\r\nsame playground and the same language teachers.  In\r\n\r\nthis system there is more inducement for pupils  to\r\n\r\nspeak each other's language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, felt that an integrated\r\n\r\nEnglish/Tamil school will help improve the standard\r\n\r\nof  the  English language and the knowledge of  the\r\n\r\nchildren considerably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that there are 42 integrated\r\n\r\nschools  in  Singapore, of  which  28  are  primary\r\n\r\nschools,  eight  are  academic  secondary  schools,\r\n\r\nthree  are technical secondary and the other  three\r\n\r\nare  vocational secondary schools. These integrated\r\n\r\nschools  are  understood to be either  English  and\r\n\r\nChinese  streams  or English and Malay  streams  -\r\n\r\nnone in the English and Tamil streams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason it is suggested that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  look into  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nestablishing  integrated English/Tamil  schools  in\r\n\r\nareas  where  Tamils  are residing  in  significant\r\n\r\nnumbers  such as Farrer Park, Pasir Panjang,  Anson\r\n\r\nand Sembawang, or at such strategic places where it\r\n\r\nwill serve the general need of the community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is suggested that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should make an attempt to integrate  at\r\n\r\nleast  the  two primary Tamil schools  run  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, namely, Aravinder Tamil School and  St.\r\n\r\nGeorge's  Road  Tamil School with the  neighbouring\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools. In the case of St. George's  Road\r\n\r\nschool,  as  the  Kallang Basin and  Toa  Payoh  is\r\n\r\nbecoming  a  fast developing area, a new integrated\r\n\r\nschool may be built in this area for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that in the integrated schools the\r\n\r\nteachers  could be interchangeable. Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nteachers are expected to be well equipped with  the\r\n\r\nlanguages  they  teach. It is understood  that  in-service courses are arranged for teachers who  wish\r\n\r\nto  specialise  in  certain subjects.  It  is  also\r\n\r\nunderstood  that there are specialist teachers  who\r\n\r\nhave  undergone training in the United Kingdom  for\r\n\r\nteaching  English  as a second language.  Such  in-service courses or specialist training courses  are\r\n\r\nnot  available to Tamil language teachers  in  both\r\n\r\nEnglish and Tamil schools. For this reason,  it  is\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  selected Tamil  language  teachers\r\n\r\nfrom   both  the  English  and  Tamil  streams   of\r\n\r\neducation  may  be sent to Indian universities  for\r\n\r\nspecialised  training.  Eventually  they   may   be\r\n\r\nemployed  as  lecturers for in-service courses  for\r\n\r\nthe Tamil language in the T.T.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the learning of a second language has\r\n\r\nbeen made compulsory since 1966, many Tamil parents\r\n\r\nin  Mission schools have complained that they would\r\n\r\nlike  their  children to study Tamil  as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage.   But  such  facilities  are  not   being\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the Mission schools.  In  the  spirit\r\n\r\nlanguage classes where some students attend Chinese\r\n\r\nand Malay language classes, Tamil-speaking children\r\n\r\neither  waste  their  period  or  go  without   any\r\n\r\nlanguage lessons at all. It is suggested that where\r\n\r\nthere is an adequate number of children and a Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage  teacher  could be employed  economically,\r\n\r\nthe Education Minister should look into such issues\r\n\r\nand  could direct the Mission schools to follow the\r\n\r\nGovernment system of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the policy of implementing integrated Tamil\r\n\r\nschools,  the  status and future  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nTamil  schools should not be affected. Any possible\r\n\r\nintegration   of  these  schools   should   be   in\r\n\r\nconsultation with the School Management  Committees\r\n\r\nbeforehand.  On  the  other hand,  Government  help\r\n\r\nshould  be  forthcoming to improve the teaching  of\r\n\r\nEnglish in these schools in order that a student in\r\n\r\na  Tamil secondary school may be placed in an equal\r\n\r\nposition  and opportunity with his counterparts  in\r\n\r\nthe  other language streams, such as Chinese, Malay\r\n\r\nand English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to say that the implementation of\r\n\r\nintegrated  English/Tamil schools will be  in  line\r\n\r\nwith the Government's oft-declared policy of giving\r\n\r\nequality  to  all  streams of  education,  such  as\r\n\r\nEnglish,  Chinese, Malay and Tamil, and will  be  a\r\n\r\nhallmark  of  authority and safety  for  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage in the Republic of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A.

Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I refer to the\r\n\r\nstatement  just made by the Member for Farrer  Park\r\n\r\non  the  curriculum of our Tamil  schools.  I  must\r\n\r\npoint  out  that the curriculum in all our  schools\r\n\r\nhas been standardised since 1959. Tamil schools are\r\n\r\nfollowing  the  same curriculum  as  that  for  the\r\n\r\nMalay,  Chinese and English schools.  It  was  only\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  two years that English  language\r\n\r\ninstruction   in  Government-aided  Tamil   primary\r\n\r\nschools  has  been put on a firm basis,  when  even\r\n\r\nclasses  as small as 15 in enrolment were  eligible\r\n\r\nfor second language teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be remembered that the second language\r\n\r\nwas  made compulsory at Secondary I level only with\r\n\r\neffect  from  January 1966. In order to  make  this\r\n\r\neffective,  it was decided that every pupil  should\r\n\r\noffer  a  second  language in  the  primary  school\r\n\r\nleaving  examination with effect from  1966.  Since\r\n\r\nlast  year,  therefore, all the Tamil schools  have\r\n\r\nbeen  provided with English language teachers,  and\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of  English  in  Tamil  schools  has\r\n\r\nalready shown considerable improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, an intensive training programme for\r\n\r\nsecond language teachers commenced at the Teachers'\r\n\r\nTraining College in 1965. And this step is aimed at\r\n\r\nimparting   a   more  effective   second   language\r\n\r\ninstruction in English in all non-English schools.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways to raise the standard of English in\r\n\r\nTamil  schools  would be to teach certain  subjects\r\n\r\nsuch  as  Mathematics and Science  in  English.  By\r\n\r\nconstantly  following lessons  in  English,  pupils\r\n\r\nwill, over a period, having listened to, taken part\r\n\r\nin  discussions, reading and talking in the English\r\n\r\nlanguage, become familiar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the English language. The pupils in Government-aided   English  secondary  schools   are   already\r\n\r\nattending  Tamil classes organised by the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education,   together   with   students   from\r\n\r\nGovernment  English  secondary schools  at  various\r\n\r\ncentres  in  Singapore. The teaching  of  Tamil  in\r\n\r\nprimary schools is undertaken during school  hours\r\n\r\nin  the  schools  which  have  asked  for  language\r\n\r\ninstruction in Tamil. So far, only one request  has\r\n\r\nbeen   received  from  a  Government-aided  English\r\n\r\nschool  and  it  has been provided  with  full-time\r\n\r\nTamil  language teachers. If the Ministry,  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  time,  receives  requests  from   other\r\n\r\nGovernment-aided   schools  for   second   language\r\n\r\ninstruction  in Tamil, teachers will  certainly  be\r\n\r\nprovided.  Though  we do not have integrated  Tamil\r\n\r\nschools  as such, there are two Tamil schools,  the\r\n\r\nAravinder and Pasir Panjang Tamil School which  are\r\n\r\nfunctioning in Silat Integrated Primary School  and\r\n\r\nLabrador Primary School respectively. The pupils of\r\n\r\nthese two Tamil schools mix freely with pupils from\r\n\r\nthe  other  language streams in the same  building,\r\n\r\nalthough  they retain their identity  by  having  a\r\n\r\nseparate  name for their school and are  headed  by\r\n\r\ntheir  own Principal. In respect of mixing together\r\n\r\noutside  of  classrooms, in the  canteens,  on  the\r\n\r\nplaying  field  and  in  the other  extra-curricula\r\n\r\nactivities, although they retain their  own  names,\r\n\r\nintegration  between the schools I  have  mentioned\r\n\r\nis,  in  effect,  very much like integration  among\r\n\r\nother streams in other parts of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education has been contemplating\r\n\r\nintegrated  Tamil schools in the  area  where  many\r\n\r\nTamils live, and I certainly welcome the support of\r\n\r\nthe   Member  for  Farrer  Park  in  what  he   has\r\n\r\nsuggested. The integration of St.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge's  Tamil School will be considered when  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the Kallang Basin takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to raise the standard of teaching in\r\n\r\nTamil  schools, plans are being drawn  up  for  the\r\n\r\nfollowing  in-service courses for  Tamil  teachers:\r\n\r\nteaching   of   Mathematics  in  primary   schools;\r\n\r\nteaching  of  Arts  and Crafts in primary  schools;\r\n\r\nteaching of Science in primary schools; teaching of\r\n\r\nTamil  in  Tamil schools, and, lastly, teaching  of\r\n\r\nTamil  in English schools. The syllabuses  are  now\r\n\r\nbeing worked out and it is expected to make a start\r\n\r\nat  the Teachers' Training College in the following\r\n\r\nterm. The question of offering scholarships to  the\r\n\r\nbest  students  from  both the  English  and  Tamil\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education  to study  Tamil  in  Indian\r\n\r\nUniversities will be given due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the hon. Member for Farrer Park will now\r\n\r\nagree  with me that my Ministry has been doing  all\r\n\r\nit  can to improve the standard of English in Tamil\r\n\r\nschools  and  the  standard  of  Tamil  in  English\r\n\r\nschools  and  the standard of Tamil  in  any  other\r\n\r\nschools  where there are pupils who wish  to  study\r\n\r\nthe  Tamil language. Our aim is to make every pupil\r\n\r\nproficient in at least two languages in our  multi-racial  society.  We  have not  ignored  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nschools or the Tamil students in English schools or\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in attempting to achieve this objective,\r\n\r\nand I can assure the Member for Farrer Park that we\r\n\r\nshall not ignore them in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Twenty-eight Minutes to Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><i>Wednesday, 22nd June, 1966</i></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>REVISION OF LOCAL POSTAGE RATES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

A fair number of the drains in this area are \ufffddry\ufffd , namely without\r\n\r\nflow of water during dry weather, and as such should not give rise to any mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding. There is, however, evidence of indiscriminate dumping of refuse by householders \r\n\r\nor other persons into drains and on vacant land in this area.  Action has, in \r\n\r\nfact, been taken by the Public Cleansing Department on these contraventions\r\n\r\nof the Cleansing Regulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special mosquito survey was conducted on 14th June, 1966 of houses\r\n\r\nin the area bounded by Moonstone Lane, Opal Crescent, Ruby Lane, Topaz \r\n\r\nRoad, Woodsville Road, Meyappa Chettiar Road and the surroundings. This\r\n\r\nsurvey showed that of the 167 premises inspected, 22 (14 per cent) were\r\n\r\nfound to have places which bred mosquitoes.  The places where mosquitoes \r\n\r\nhad been found to breed include articles ranging from disused motor truck \r\n\r\ntires, fish tanks, tin-pails, disused W.C. pans, earth drains and sullage drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general situation of this area also favours the breeding of mosquitoes,\r\n\r\nwhich is only 200 yards from Sungei Kallang.  Sungei Kallang has been a \r\n\r\nfrequent source of mosquito breeding because of changes in water level and \r\n\r\nother problems of drainage and water flow.  There are also the problems of \r\n\r\nextensive earth movements and silting at the mouth of this river.  Owing to \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmultiple problems in connection with this river, only palliative measures by\r\n\r\noiling against mosquito breeding can be taken and although of limited value, \r\n\r\nthis is being done. The proper solution to the problem of Sungei Kallang is \r\n\r\nimprovement to the banks of the river.  The attention of the Public Works \r\n\r\nDepartment and Housing and Development Board, who are carrying out this work, \r\n\r\nhas been drawn to this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Refuse bin-centre referred to is a pre-war bin centre situated on Crown\r\n\r\nland, and situated at least 25 feet (not 10 feet as stated) from the nearest house \r\n\r\nand is built on a concrete platform.  It is also sited conveniently for the cleansing \r\n\r\nbeat labourers to dispose of the refuse from adjacent kampongs.  The centre is also \r\n\r\nsituated away from the main Serangoon Road and adjacent to the kampong area.
