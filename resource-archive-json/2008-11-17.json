<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B>&nbsp;Mr Siew Kum Hong has asked for an update on <p align=left>Column: 682</p>MAS' investigations into allegations of mis-selling, and also an update on the review of the marketing and sale of structured products. A number of possible cases of mis-selling have been brought to MAS' attention and MAS is following up on them. MAS has confirmed that it has been conducting formal inquiries into allegations of breaches of the law, inadequate internal controls by the financial institutions&nbsp;that sold structured products linked to Lehman Brothers, and poor sales practices by their representatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will take firm and appropriate regulatory actions where there are breaches of law or regulations by the financial institutions or their representatives. These regulatory actions could include fines, public reprimands and prohibition orders which bar the financial institution or a representative from providing financial advisory service for a specified period of time. MAS' inquiries are progressing, and it will make an announcement on any actions it is taking when they are completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MAS considers its current regulatory regime for marketing of investment products as fundamentally sound, it is undertaking a review in light of recent developments not just in Singapore but&nbsp;globally. MAS has announced that the review may include stronger suitability requirements for certain types of products, clearer product labelling and risk rating, and simpler descriptions of the features and risks of products so that they can be more readily understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing our current regulatory and supervisory approach, however, MAS intends to be careful not to come up with overly prescriptive rules which may not serve all investors. MAS' approach has allowed Singaporeans a wider choice of investment options to cater to their diverse needs. It is studying the specific <p align=left>Column: 683</p>refinements that need to be made carefully so that we do not make hasty changes that bring unintended consequences in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, regulation cannot be the only solution. All stakeholders have a role to play. The Boards and senior management of financial institutions must embed a culture within their institutions of ensuring fair dealing for customers of their institutions. In this regard, MAS has instructed the CEOs of all&nbsp;financial institutions to conduct a thorough review of their financial instutitions' processes and procedures for their sales and marketing activities. Investors too have to play their roles, by reading product disclosures and making the effort to understand the products they purchase. This will reduce the risk of they being sold products which do not meet their needs or which are beyond their ability to absorb in terms of the risks that need to be absorbed.&nbsp; Where there is no mis-selling, investors have to take responsibility for their investment decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Siew has also asked for MAS' views on how the financial institutions have been handling the customers' complaints process thus far. MAS has been following up with the financial institutions to ensure that they are handling all investors' complaints&nbsp;&ndash; and I repeat&nbsp;&ndash; all investors' complaints in accordance with the impartial process that has been set up, and to do so with full urgency and seriousness.&nbsp; This has been communicated at the most senior levels of each of the institutions.&nbsp; MAS receives regular updates from the independent persons who have been&nbsp;appointed to oversee the complaints handling and resolution process in each financial institution. The financial institutions have put in concerted efforts and additional dedicated resources to deal with all complaints. While there were <p align=left>Column: 684</p>some difficulties at the start, MAS has seen improvements. Some&nbsp;financial institutions&nbsp;have made good progress in the resolution of complaints, and MAS has welcomed this. Others which were lagging earlier have now put in greater effort and resources. MAS is monitoring the progress of all the financial institutions concerned.&nbsp; It expects the financial institutions to deal fairly with all cases, regardless of the background of the investors and&nbsp;whether they were&nbsp;investors that fall within the vulnerable category or otherwise,&nbsp;with a view to reaching fair resolution where there is evidence of mis-selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim has asked whether structured notes similar to Lehman Brothers products were sold in the United States and how investor complaints on such products are being handled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Structured notes have been marketed to retail investors in the United States.&nbsp; In fact, recent press articles from the US have indeed highlighted how the recent Lehman Brothers bankruptcy has resulted in investors, both retail and institutional, suffering significant losses on structured notes. Structured notes have also been sold in other countries, including the UK, Australia, Germany, France, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory regime for investment products in Singapore is not fundamentally different from that in other reputable jurisdictions like the US, UK and Australia. The basic principles are similar - financial institutions and issuers are required to properly disclose key product information; financial advisers and their representatives in the sales and advisory process have responsibilities to abide by, which are set out very clearly in the Financial Advisers Act; the role of investors, in turn, is to ensure they understand the products they invest in and, where there is no mis-seeling, to take responsibility for their investment decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 685</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, financial institutions are required to properly disclose to investors the features and risks of the products they distribute. They and their representatives must have a reasonable basis for recommending investments, taking into consideration the investment objectives, financial situation and needs of the investor. In addition, the MAS has published a set of good practices which financial institutions are encouraged to follow. These are good practices over and above the regulatory requirements which are specified under the law.&nbsp; There is, of course,&nbsp;in place, quite importantly, the MoneySENSE programme&nbsp;&ndash; a national financial education programme&nbsp;that aims to enhance the financial literacy and sophistication&nbsp;of investors and to empower them&nbsp;to make informed decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Sylvia Lim has also asked about how investor complaints are being looked into in the United States. In relation to the Lehman notes, reports indicate that some investors have approached lawyers to look into pursuing arbitration claims with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)&nbsp;&ndash; previously called NASD&nbsp;&ndash; which&nbsp;is an industry-based regulatory body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, as my colleague Mr Lim Hng Kiang elaborated at some length a month ago in Parliament, MAS has set out a three-step dispute resolution process, including procedures to ensure the fair and impartial handling of complaints by the relevant financial institutions and arbitration of disputes between investors and the financial institutions. MAS has been active in supervising these procedures, and its priority is to ensure that every complaint is dealt with appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Siew Kum Hong (Nominated Member):</B>&nbsp;Sir, I have three supplementary questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 686</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first question for the Minister&nbsp;is whether MAS will expand the scope of its review to include how such products are structured, in particular to examine instances where retail investors end up effectively insuring the originator of the product as with the mini-bonds.&nbsp; And will MAS also consider whether originators and distributors of structured products should be required to clearly disclose their profit margins and commissions earned, as with insurance products?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my second question is to ask what is MAS' view on the recent complaints by investors that DBS has been acting too slowly and, in some cases, has even been non-responsive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question is whether MAS is taking proactive steps on other structured products not linked to Lehman Brothers where mis-selling could, nevertheless, have occurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> &nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Siew Kum Hong for those questions.&nbsp; On the first question of whether the MAS would expand its review to look into how the products are structured&nbsp;&ndash; ie,&nbsp;whether there is some element of the product that requires the retail investor to effectively be insuring the issuer or any other aspect of structuring the product, and whether there should also be disclosure of commissions&nbsp;&ndash; MAS is undertaking a thorough review on all aspects (advertising, marketing the products, all aspects of the sale process, and post-sale process of risk assessment within an institution).&nbsp; It will look at all aspects, but I think it will not want to substitute the regulator's judgment for that of the financial institution and the investor for any product.&nbsp; What is formal, useful and, I think, a far better way of ensuring that diverse needs can be met of the investing public is to ensure simple, clear and good <p align=left>Column: 687</p>disclosure, and to ensure fair and reasoned financial advice that takes into account the investor's risk profile and means.&nbsp; Those are the two most important precepts&nbsp;&ndash; disclosure and sale practices&nbsp;&ndash; which have to be sound, well reasoned and taking into account the interest of the investor, rather than MAS substituting its judgment for that of financial institution and the investor as to what type of products to be in the market and how they should be structured.&nbsp;So I think that should be the general approach, but I say this without wanting to pre-empt MAS' review.&nbsp; It is going to be a thorough review and all aspects will be looked at, including the issue of commissions which Mr Siew Kum Hong has mentioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On DBS being too slow, I would rather not comment on specific&nbsp; financial institutions.&nbsp; I have no reason to believe that DBS, in particular, has been slow in processing of complaints.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us leave it to the MAS in its dealing with those institutions and leave it to the MAS in its inquiries and investigations into this whole episode to derive conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On whether the MAS is looking at structured notes more generally&nbsp;&ndash; yes, it is.&nbsp; MAS has a good handle on this.&nbsp; It has been very careful and deliberate in its statement so as to serve the interest of investors best.&nbsp; MAS is not simply being reactive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

And I doubt MAS will want to conclude that all structured products should be banned from the retail public.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, because that is&nbsp;a large&nbsp;universe of&nbsp;products, a whole range of equity-linked notes, some of which are fairly basic notes but with a little kicker based on equity prices, and some of which are more complex.&nbsp; There are notes which are credit-linked notes such as Lehman Minibonds, Pinnacles, and some others, which involve a higher degree of risks because it is linked to default of the referenced entities.&nbsp; So there are varying degrees of complexity and risks.&nbsp; And I think it is very hard to draw a thick black line around what you consider safe, not so safe, and positively risky.&nbsp; It is going to be extremely difficult for the regulator to substitute his judgment for that of the market and the investor.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)</B>:&nbsp; I have two supplementary questions.&nbsp; First is on <p align=left>Column: 689</p>this issue about the investigations conducted by the financial institutions.&nbsp; There has been some feedback from my residents and also members of the public that the panel set up by the financial institutions and the banks may not be independent enough to review these things.&nbsp; In fact, the investors feel they may be disadvantaged if they do this.&nbsp; Would the Minister consider setting up an independent panel, perhaps by MAS, to investigate the selling of such structured products, ie, the issue that we are talking about right now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I have heard that some governments have set up high-level committees to investigate any regulatory breaches in the sale of the structured products&nbsp;&ndash; the same products that were sold here.&nbsp; In view of the seriousness of the issue, would the Minister consider, perhaps, setting up a parliamentary committee to investigate any regulatory breaches by the financial institutions and any related parties&nbsp;with regard to these structured products?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> &nbsp; I would like to thank Mr Inderjit Singh for his two questions which are related to some extent.&nbsp;&nbsp;His first question was whether there should be an independent panel to evaluate complaints rather than to go through the financial institutions.&nbsp; And&nbsp;his second question, if I got&nbsp;him right, was whether there should be a high-level committee, for instance, a parliamentary committee, to look at whether there have been breaches of regulations.&nbsp; I think the desire for independence in this process is an important one and a valid one, and that is precisely what MAS' approach is providing.&nbsp; This is exactly the approach which MAS has taken&nbsp;&ndash; ensure that at each step of the process, there is independent evaluation of investors' complaints.&nbsp; I will come in a minute to the investigation&nbsp;into financial institutions themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 690</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the investors' complaints, at each step of the process, it ensures there is independent judgment being applied, and it has not been tilted in favour of the financial institution or in favour of the investor.&nbsp; What we have done essentially is to ensure independent and fair resolution of the disputes without either being overly legalistic and without politicising the process.&nbsp; And to do either of those, to be either overly legalistic or to politicise the process, will not be in the interest of investors.&nbsp; It will drag out the process, it will push the financial institutions to the wall&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;it will have their backs against the walls&nbsp;&ndash; and they will slow everything down, they will be overly legalistic, and investors are far less likely to get&nbsp;fair restitution.&nbsp; So the approach being taken is not one which is not independent.&nbsp; The approach being taken is one which ensures independence at each step of the process without being legalistic and without politicising the process.&nbsp; And I think the MAS has got the balance right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can explain it further&nbsp;&ndash; first step in the process is investors' complaints are assessed by each financial institution.&nbsp; It was not left to the financial institution alone to assess it.&nbsp; The MAS required that they appoint independent persons approved by the MAS, reputable independent persons that are not linked to those institutions, to oversee the process.&nbsp; And that is not casual oversight.&nbsp; I can tell you the three independent persons.&nbsp; I am not sure if they are being paid but, if they are, it is probably a pittance.&nbsp; They are putting in a lot of time into this process, evaluating the questions being asked of investors, evaluating the way in which investors' responses are being recorded, evaluating the way in which judgment is reached on whether there was mis-selling, whether there was partial mis-selling, or whether, in fact, it was the investors' own responsibility.&nbsp; It is a matter of details, it is a painstaking and laborious matter, but the three independent parties <p align=left>Column: 691</p>have been very actively overseeing this process, and they have been in close contact with MAS throughout this process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second step&nbsp;&ndash; if investors are still unhappy with the outcome of the process at the level of the financial institutions, they can take it to FIDReC. What is FIDReC?&nbsp; It is an independent body set up specifically to be able to provide fair and objective arbitration between the investor and the financial institution.&nbsp; It is manned by highly qualified people, adjudicators, most of whom have legal experience who are experienced in arbitration.&nbsp; FIDReC is independent, it is qualified and it is a second level of check in the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, thirdly, of course, investors can, if they wish, seek recourse in the courts, which are, of course, independent.&nbsp; So at each step of the process, there is independence but it is not one which required investors to jump immediately to the courts where things will necessarily have to go according to the strict letter of the law.&nbsp; And we think this process where you have judgment being applied in the financial institution on what happened, some judgment being applied as to how investors can be fairly restituted where there is some element of mis-selling or some element in which they were misguided,&nbsp;is a superior process for the investors, and it is more likely to lead to a fair outcome for the investors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to be quite frank, if you ask me where my sympathies are, if you ask Senior Minister where his sympathies are, or Mr Lim Hng Kiang, our sympathies are with the investors.&nbsp; How do we go about ensuring that the investors' interests are met is the issue at hand, not whether we sympathise with them, because we do.&nbsp; For many of them, it is actually very sad what has happened.&nbsp; But how do we go about ensuring their interests are met?&nbsp; If <p align=left>Column: 692</p>we either politicise the process or take an overly legalistic approach, as opposed to this case-by-case evaluation in the financial institutions and FIDReC, there is less likelihood that we will get a fair outcome for investors.&nbsp; So we are doing this in a way that may not appear to be making bold political headlines, or it may not even be politically unpopular at each stage of the game, but it is the right thing to do, it is the fairest thing to do, and we have the investors' interests at heart in doing it this way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On his second point, I am aware that Hong Kong Legico, not the government, has set up a sub-committee&nbsp;&ndash; I think that is what it is called&nbsp;&ndash; to look into whether there were breaches of regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is one approach.&nbsp; Our approach is different.&nbsp; We have the MAS as an independent body&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I do not think anyone questions its independence&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;staffed by highly-qualified personnel to look thoroughly into every possible breach of regulation&nbsp;&ndash; law regulation and sales practice.&nbsp; They are working day and night on this.&nbsp; This is not a softly, softly&nbsp;approach.&nbsp; And when they get results, arrive at their findings, they will take action.&nbsp; And along the way, when they arrive at findings, they also inform financial institutions of the assumptions that need to be made in evaluating each individual investor's appeals, because what MAS determines in general for sales practices in financial institutions should also influence how the financial institution deals with each individual investor.&nbsp; So there is some interaction between those processes.&nbsp; So this is again a way of doing it which ensures independence, rigour but without politicising the process.&nbsp; And I think that will provide the fairest deal to the investor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAS has been receiving feedback throughout this process from individual investors, through the email, through phone calls and&nbsp;through letters (some handwritten letters).&nbsp; It listens to all <p align=left>Column: 693</p>feedback.&nbsp; It also receives petitions from Mr Tan Kin Lian and others.&nbsp; And MAS&nbsp;has an open mind&nbsp;of all the feedback it receives, but it has to go about this&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;not as judge, not substituting its own judgment on cases&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;by preserving a system that is independent, fair,&nbsp;and a system that has&nbsp;recourse to the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy if Senior Minister,&nbsp;Mr Lim Hng Kiang or me wanted to try and put pressure on MAS to put pressure on the financial institutions, we may look good politically, but not only is it not likely to get the outcome we want for investors, it is also going to be the way in which investors' interests will be hurt in future.&nbsp; The next time banks want to come up with products, the next time we&nbsp;go through any episode, we will be best served by having rule of law, good practices within the institutions, rather than a system that has to act by the whims or the convenience of political interests.&nbsp; That is our approach.&nbsp; So make no mistake about this.&nbsp; MAS is not cloistered&nbsp;&ndash; I do not know what number Shenton Way it is but it looks like a very formidable building&nbsp;&ndash; they are listening to feedback all the time, they are interacting with institutions, and I should mention to you also, they have been in very close contact with the trustees and receivers for Lehman Minibonds to ensure that every restructuring option that can be in the interest of investors is looked into.&nbsp; MAS has been very active in this game with the trustees and receivers to make sure that every restructuring option that can serve the interest of investors is being looked into.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen (Nominated Member)</B>:&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions.&nbsp; Sir, up until now, the men-on-the-street have placed their trust in our banking institutions such as DBS, which truly is&nbsp;a Singapore brand name.&nbsp; And because trust <p align=left>Column: 694</p>is not a word that the Government or the people take lightly, and we have been told that we can trust our institutions, I would like to ask: is it fair that the men-on-the-street, who clearly do not know much about these investments and many of them who were clearly working on the basis of trust, end up being the ones who lose out?&nbsp; And if this was the case, will this erode trust in our system?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, will the Minister agree with John Peterson, an article in <I>TODAY</I>, when he said that banks were selling complex products for which they were never correctly licensed and over which they have been poorly regulated, and his proposal that regulators separate the simple banking licence from the licence to sell products, and that we should allow banks to be one or the other and not both?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> First, on&nbsp;her question of trust, if indeed an investor has been sold a product that is clearly unsuitable for his or her profile, given&nbsp;his age, experience in the markets, income, or if&nbsp;he has&nbsp;put into that product a very large proportion of&nbsp;his total assets, and if there are clear-cut cases of a mismatch of product with the investor, then the financial institutions and FIDReC will ensure that the investor gets&nbsp;proper restitution.&nbsp; That is the way in which we will preserve trust in the system.&nbsp; But if the investor knew what he or she was doing, took a risk, and it turned out wrongly, then the way to preserve trust in the system is not to ask the financial institution, \"Never mind, you cough up\".&nbsp; That is the way to weaken trust in the system.&nbsp; So I think we will have to be fair&nbsp;and objective about this.&nbsp; Err on the side of the investor where there is a good measure of doubt as to whether the investor was given proper advice, but keep the basic precepts of the system that this is not a bully system, this is a system where you got to operate by rules, guidelines and sound management prac<p align=left>Column: 695</p>tice.&nbsp; I think that is the way we preserve trust in our system and that is how investors will benefit, not just in this episode but in future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry I have not read that article&nbsp;she mentioned.&nbsp; But I am sure the MAS in its review of products and the institutional practices that lie behind the sales of products will look at all views.&nbsp; The view that&nbsp;she mentioned, from my hearing it at the first time, was a little simple, a little black and white, because this has been debated extensively in the US and&nbsp;other places for a long time, and they have moved away from a clear separation of investment banking and commercial banking.&nbsp; There is now in fact universal banking being practised across many institutions.&nbsp; It makes the task of the regulator more complex.&nbsp; But it is not necessarily a safer system to simply separate these things out into different institutions.&nbsp; Huge problems have happened in&nbsp;Monoline insurers.&nbsp; Huge problems have happened in institutions that are dedicated and specialised to just&nbsp;certain segments of the markets.&nbsp; So, at the end of the day, it is about corporate governance,&nbsp;risk management,&nbsp;sound supervision and&nbsp;disclosure practices that allow investors to make sound judgments.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE:::702-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As signatories are not required to disclose their medical conditions when making an AMD, I do not have the breakdown as requested by Dr Fatimah Lateef.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our AMD rate of 0.4% is low.&nbsp; But this is the experience in many other countries too.&nbsp; For example, in Australia, the sign-up rate is even lower, at 0.2%.&nbsp; The US is unique in having a much higher sign-up rate compared to the rest of the world.&nbsp; Their rate is around 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One major reason for the higher sign-up rate in the US is the openness in which the patients and the doctors there are able to actively engage in discussions on <p align=left>Column: 697</p>advance directives and end-of-life issues.&nbsp; In fact, the Americans&nbsp;have a Patient Self-Determination Act which requires Government-funded hospitals, hospices and nursing homes to ask all adult patients, at the time of admission, if they have made an advance directive, and if not, to inform them about their right to do so.&nbsp; Such information is then required to be documented in the patient's medical records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In sharp contrast, our society remains rather squeamish about discussions on AMDs.&nbsp; Our AMD Act specifically prohibits doctors and nurses involved in the care of a patient from asking whether or not the patient has made or intends to make an AMD.&nbsp; It will be a criminal offence if they do and there are severe penalties including a fine and jail term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our AMD Act further requires the AMD Register to be kept strictly confidential.&nbsp; So a doctor may request for a search of the AMD Register only when his patient is terminally ill, unconscious,&nbsp;and would require extraordinary life-sustaining treatment.&nbsp; We are quite unique in the world in imposing such restrictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading the <I>Hansard</I> records of the debate in the House on AMD, I gather that these restrictions were put in as there were concerns by some Singaporeans that a doctor may be less forthcoming in his treatment if he knows that his patient has already signed an AMD.&nbsp; I am confident that our doctors are ethical and will do what is necessary for their patients, regardless of their AMD status.&nbsp; Unfortunately, such fear, though groundless, remains among some Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The restrictions have inadvertently become counterproductive to the intent of the AMD by making discussions on AMD taboo.&nbsp; This is a major reason for the lack of awareness and apathy among the <p align=left>Column: 698</p>public and even healthcare professionals on the AMD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my view that we should change this attitude and help Singaporeans cope with end-of-life issues in a much more scientific and mature manner.&nbsp; Death is a certainty and must not be a taboo subject.&nbsp; For the terminally ill, we do need to engage them and their family members early to understand their concerns and their preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am inclined to amend the AMD Act in two ways.&nbsp; First, make it simpler to sign up for an AMD.&nbsp; The requirement that the form must be witnessed by a doctor has deterred many as they find it a hassle and costly.&nbsp; Many have asked me to drop this requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, drop the restrictionsthat have made AMD a taboo subject between doctors and their patients.&nbsp; We must promote greater openness the way the Americans have done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I do not know if Singaporeans are ready for these amendments.&nbsp; I will do more sounding and I certainly welcome Members' advice on this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, we will ensure that written materials on AMDs will be made easily accessible to the public, at the clinics, in the hospitals and nursing homes.&nbsp; The recent public debate on euthanasia, hospice and palliative care has been useful to get more Singaporeans to think about and discuss end-of-life issues.&nbsp; My Ministry will also encourage hospitals and nursing homes to engage their patients and their families in general discussions on advance care planning, including AMD.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I suppose the small number of six AMDs being put into effect in a way reflects that the pool of AMD's signatories is small, to begin with.&nbsp; As I said, we now have 10,000&nbsp;&ndash; I am one of the 10,000&nbsp;&ndash; but the vast majority of them only signed up in the last two to four years and for a long time there were just a couple of hundreds per year.&nbsp; Now we are signing up about 2,000 to 3,000 per year, and it is growing.&nbsp; And we will certainly do our best to promote this more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think the underlying difficulty is this general squeamishness among the people, whether justified or not, and I think that change will take time.&nbsp; I certainly agree that the people sector is a major partner of ours in this exercise, and that is why I welcome the Lien Centre for Palliative Care pushing more \"DIE-logues\" about death.&nbsp; That is why for several weeks when <I>Zaobao</I> kept up the debate on euthanasia, and despite some misunderstanding among the forum letters, I let the debate continue.&nbsp; Let this topic be discussed more.&nbsp; In a way, the discussions surprised me because I had thought that Asians would find death taboo and would not want to talk about it.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised by the great interest the public have on this topic and I consider it positive.&nbsp; It is our job to continue this discussion and help direct it in a positive manner.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 700</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the reasons why the 16 revoked their AMDs, we could not ask why do they revoke just as we do ask why they sign up.&nbsp; Hence, I do not have the breakdown.&nbsp; But whatever it is, the number is small.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):&nbsp;</B> Sir, whilst I appreciate the Ministry's effort to raise awareness and to simplify the processes, I like to ask the Minister: how are we going to measure this \"awareness\" amongst&nbsp;Singaporeans, because not every person who discusses about end-of-life issues will ultimately sign up for the AMD.&nbsp;&nbsp;What implications are there should the sign-up rate be high or low?&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us say, for example, if the AMD sign-up rate is high, does it reflect the fact that maybe health care cost is too high and they think that it is&nbsp;not affordable to maintain or sustain life any longer?&nbsp;\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I think AMD should never be a number game whereby we set KPIs and then we chase the numbers.&nbsp; I think that would be totally wrong.&nbsp; In any case, even if you look at the States, where I mentioned the figure of 20% among adults having signed up AMD, there is a wide variation across the States.&nbsp; Some states have single digit percentage of AMD rate and this is after more than 20 years of a much more open attitude towards discussing death and end-of-life matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To me, the key issue is not so much about AMDs or how many people sign up, but about advance planning, particularly among the terminally ill.&nbsp; When a patient picks up a terminal illness, for example cancer, then at a suitable point, as health care providers, we really would need to engage the patients and their families so as to mentally prepare them about the possibility of end-of-life issues.&nbsp; There are many personal preferences and decisions that we need to know ahead of time and the earlier it is discussed in an open manner, I think it should help the <p align=left>Column: 701</p>terminally ill as well as their family members cope better.&nbsp; So that is the attitude I am bringing to the table on this subject.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a possibility to consider a kind of&nbsp;bridging of information into the health screening programme that we do quite extensively now because I think it is a comprehensive package we have for health screening.&nbsp; Perhaps broaching the idea during these sessions could be good as well.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Dr Fatimah that we need more sessions both with the public as well as with the doctors.&nbsp; I have mentioned this point in one sitting before that some of our focus group discussions revealed that even among doctors there were some, I hope not the majority, who themselves are uncomfortable about discussing AMD and end-of-life issues with their patients.&nbsp; So you can see we are in a bit of an uphill task here.&nbsp; But there is no shortcut to overcoming this problem, and we just need more \"DIElogues\" with Singaporeans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second part about health screening and incorporating AMD questions into it, we are bound by the current law.&nbsp; As I said just now, we are not supposed to ask the question, \"Have you signed up AMD?\" or \"Do you intend to sign up AMD?\"&nbsp; If we ask such a question, we will be sent to jail.&nbsp; So it is these restrictions which we have imposed <p align=left>Column: 702</p>into the Act, maybe for a good reason 11 years ago but, honestly, I feel that it is outdated and, in any case, no other countries do that.&nbsp;

That is why I suppose the translators wander into this \"<I>an le shi</I>\" as an euphemism.&nbsp; But even \"<I>an le shi</I>\" causes problem because I have had feedback from some of the readers that it is misleading.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien) (for the Minister for National Development):</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, before I discuss the investment guidelines that Ms Olsen has asked for, we should first understand the nature of the funds for which the investment guidelines were adopted for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Town Councils (TCs) maintain two funds: an operating fund for short-term expenditure needs, and a sinking fund to cater to the long-term maintenance expenditure needs of the common property in HDB estates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long-term or cyclical expenditure needs generally involve more expensive works.&nbsp; There are lifts, pumps and pipes to be replaced, roofs to be re-roofed and repairs and redecorations to blocks to be done. &nbsp;TCs also use their sinking funds to fund their co-payment of lift upgrading, so that residents pay an even smaller percentage of the total lift upgrading cost.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The funding for these large expenditures is collected over time as part of the monthly service and conservancy charges.&nbsp; This way, residents do not have to fork out a large sum every time one of these works needs to be done.&nbsp; The larger the <p align=left>Column: 704</p>number of flats under a TC's management, the larger the funds need to be accumulated to cater to such works.&nbsp; The Town Councils Act governs the use of sinking funds.&nbsp; In other words, the Town Council could not just use sinking funds for any other purpose but what has been prescribed in the Town Councils Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the Town Council funds are not eroded by inflation as they are being accumulated, TCs need to invest their funds prudently.&nbsp; Therefore, MND has guidelines in the Town Councils Financial Rules that regulate what TCs can invest in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TCs are allowed to invest funds that are not required for immediate use in Singapore denominated fixed deposits, stocks, funds and securities.&nbsp; Investments in stocks, funds or securities must be on the advice of a qualified person.&nbsp; Examples of qualified persons are an investment adviser holding a licence under the Securities and Futures Act and an approved bank or a merchant bank approved as a financial institution under the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MND has imposed an investment cap of 35% on TCs' investments in stocks, funds or securities that are not issued by the Singapore Government or any statutory board, or not guaranteed by the Singapore Government.&nbsp; In other words, of the total funds that they can invest in, only 35% can invest in such stocks, funds or securities that are not issued by the Singapore Government, statutory board or guaranteed by the Singapore Government.&nbsp; The investment guidelines for TCs seek to achieve an optimal balance between reasonable returns and financial prudence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the TCs' financial statements for FY2007, which ended 31st March 2008, and additional investment details recently submitted to MND, about $12 million, or about 0.6% <p align=left>Column: 705</p>of the TCs' total funds available for investment are invested in Lehman Minibond notes and other credit-linked notes for which early redemption has been triggered.&nbsp; The latter refers to DBS High Notes 5, Merrill Lynch's Jubilee Series 3 and Pinnacle Notes Series 9&nbsp;and 10.&nbsp; Of the 16 TCs, only two have invested some of their funds in the said products.&nbsp; Holland Bukit-Panjang and Pasir Ris-Punggol TCs have invested about 6.7% and 2.6% of their total funds available for investment in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the investment guidelines that MND has put in place, TCs are in the best position to determine the balance that suits their respective financial requirement and risk tolerance.&nbsp; It is neither practical nor desirable for MND to be overly prescriptive.&nbsp; MND has no intention to amend the investment guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TCs' financial statements are audited and published annually.&nbsp; These financial statements are prepared in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standards, which prescribe disclosure requirements for investments.&nbsp; In addition, the Town Councils Financial Rules require that the type of investments placed by a fund manager appointed by the TC and the market value of such investments be disclosed in the annual accounts.&nbsp; MND will continue to monitor closely for compliance with its financial guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Eunice Elizabeth Olsen:</B> &nbsp; I would like to thank the Senior Minister of State.&nbsp; I have three supplementary questions for her.&nbsp; First, Town Councils have invested in structured products.&nbsp; What is the investment process like?&nbsp; Were the Town Councils or the people in charge of approving these investments aware of the risks involved which included losing the entire sum?&nbsp; Second,&nbsp;my question is whether the intent for allowing Town Councils to invest is to go for higher returns or to seek stable returns.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 706</p>SMS think there is a need for town council to invest in risky and complex financial products since the higher the return, the higher the risk?&nbsp; Can I ask what is the value of those investments now?</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Grace Fu Hai Yien</B>:&nbsp; I would like to take the third question first, ie, whether we should allow Town Councils to take higher risk or lower risk, or whether we should prescribe generally a risk tolerance.&nbsp; I think if you go back to the objective of setting up Town Councils some 20 years ago, the idea was really to devolve estate management functions to the local MP and, with that, it comes along the responsibility and accountability for all the decisions relating to that, including decisions like what are the charges that you should impose, how do you intend to run the Town Council functions,&nbsp;how you should provide for the sinking fund needs over the long run.&nbsp; We cannot cut out one part for the other because if you do that, it will be making the&nbsp;Town Councils impossible to operate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Councils will have to decide for themselves what are the kind of charges&nbsp;they like to impose and how do&nbsp;they intend to meet their long-term needs with the sinking funds that&nbsp;they have collected.&nbsp; Some Town Councils perhaps would prefer to charge a higher Town Council S&amp;C charges so that they can put their savings in very, very safe investments.&nbsp; If they have put it in a fixed deposit with the bank, they would have earned 1% over the last few years, for example, on an average.&nbsp; With the inflation of 6% to 7% that we have witnessed in the last one year, that leaves a very significant inflationary gap that the Town Councils would have to meet over&nbsp;the long run.&nbsp; The Town Councils would then have to decide for themselves how do they want to meet this need.&nbsp; Some Town Councils prefer to take the other extreme position.&nbsp; They prefer to collect very low S&amp;C charges and perhaps leave the decision about sinking fund to a much later time.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 707</p>That is something that they could decide.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some&nbsp;private estates, they may have to, when the time comes,&nbsp;collect from their residents a significant amount when they want to undertake major repair works.&nbsp; Some Town Councils decide to take a position somewhere in between, collect an average S&amp;C charges, invest their sinking funds in the middle range, in terms of risky assets, so that they can try to mitigate the inflationary gap that they are seeing&nbsp;such that they are able to meet the needs in the long run, at the same time not imposing significant pressure on their residents.&nbsp; So the Town Councils would have to make that decision and it is something that they will have to be accountable for to their residents over the long run.&nbsp; It is for that precise reason that our Town Councils do require residents to be appointed to the Town Councils.&nbsp; They will be in a position there to scrutinise the accounts, to comment on the performance and basically to look over the funds that they have been paying to the Town Councils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the Town Councils aware of the risks?&nbsp; I think that is the answer that we should ask the Town Councils and it is for each of the residents to pose that question to their Town Council.&nbsp; First of all, we have already mentioned in the reply that the product has to be advised accordingly by the regulator, the person with the licence, and also that most of the Town Councils would engage the necessary town councillors with the experience to be on the council to advise them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the value of the investments, I think that is something that is out in the open.&nbsp; The few instruments that I have listed earlier on, these are instruments that already have an event triggering its default.&nbsp; So in that sense, I think it is left to the trustee to decide what is the ultimate redemption value.&nbsp; I do not&nbsp;think <p align=left>Column: 708</p>I have any more information to give at this point in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE SERVICES-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE SERVICES:::711-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In many cases of the terminally ill, a good level of palliative care is available.&nbsp; As for the current supply, I think we are able to meet that demand.&nbsp; When I look at the inpatient hospice figures, the occupancy rate is not too high; we still have vacancies to take patients in.&nbsp; Hence, for the short term, we are all right, but for the medium to long term, I would like to see growth in this sector.&nbsp; I would say that all the terminally ill cancer patients ought to have a good level of palliative care.&nbsp; Today, I think more than half, maybe 60%, have access to that.&nbsp; What about the other 40%?&nbsp; Is it because of ignorance or what is it?&nbsp; We will try to find out why.&nbsp; But beyond terminally ill cancer patients, there are also other terminal illnesses which can benefit from palliative care&nbsp;&ndash; organ failure is just one of them.&nbsp; So I think it is a topic which I would like to encourage greater awareness among the patients as well as the carers.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The problem, sometimes, is a lack of interest.&nbsp; It is a specialty that does not make a lot of money and, unfortunately, some trainees are motivated by that, and it is not unique to Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have just read the US Institute of Medicine Report (IOM) on geriatric and palliative care and it describes this whole ageing of US as a \"silver tsunami\"&nbsp;&ndash; I supposed they were inspired by the current financial tsunami from Wall Street&nbsp;&ndash; and their conclusion is that in the US, they can see this tsunami coming but the US is not prepared to deal with it.&nbsp; That is a good summation of this huge problem that the whole world would be facing in the next one or two decades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think we have to take practical approaches which are: exposing as many doctors and nurses to different aspects of <p align=left>Column: 711</p>geriatric care and palliative care so that along the way whichever department, or specialty they are in, that extra knowledge that they have picked up will be useful and be translated into better care for their patients.&nbsp;

Both involve performing an act that leads to death. The difference is that while euthanasia allows for the doctor to perform the act, in doctor-assisted suicide, the patient performs the act himself and the doctor only provides the lethal prescription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is promoting Advance Medical Directive (AMD) and palliative care.&nbsp; AMD is about letting nature take its course for the terminally ill at the last stage of their lives.&nbsp; AMD is about not mindlessly postponing death through futile medical interventions.&nbsp; AMD is not euthanasia or doctor-assisted suicide.&nbsp; I do not think that Singaporeans are ready to accept euthanasia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, we should focus on providing good palliative care for the dying and getting people to think about and plan for <p align=left>Column: 712</p>the kind of care they want at the end of their lives.&nbsp; Death should not be a taboo subject.&nbsp; There must be more public discussion about death and end-of-life matters.&nbsp; I therefore welcome the recent public debate about euthanasia.&nbsp; It has raised public awareness about palliative care and the frustrations of some terminally ill and their caregivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry will help the terminally ill cope better with end-of-life issues.&nbsp; First, we are working with the hospice and palliative care community to expand their capacity and to extend their reach. We will provide greater support to the dying persons and their caregivers, while managing their needs sensitively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we are getting more doctors and nurses to train in palliative care.

Now that there is this confusion, I think this will stand in the way of people taking up AMD. What strategies and steps&nbsp;is MOH going to embark on in order to help resolve this confusion and push the agenda forward?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to ask what&nbsp;other assistance can also be provided to caregivers? The Minister outlined three <p align=left>Column: 713</p>areas where attention will be given but there is not much said about how to assist caregivers to take care of those who are terminally ill.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B>&nbsp; I think the reply to the first query is more \"DIE-logues\". You just got to keep on talking and there is no short-cut to this. The more we talk about death and the dying trajectories, we will develop a more mature attitude towards this. And if we can overcome this squeamishness, I certainly hope to be able to amend the AMD so that doctors and providers of care can discuss end-of-life issues much more openly with their patients.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for caregivers, I am aware of the pain and sufferings they go through. Indeed, in many areas of palliative care, attention is now extended to care for the caregivers too because, often, they themselves end up ill, either in parallel with the terminally ill or soon after death. So that is a level of sophistication in palliative care that I think we are still under-developed which we should begin to build into our palliative care programme.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ENERGY MARKET AUTHORITY-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ENERGY MARKET AUTHORITY:::716-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 713</p><B>ENERGY MARKET AUTHORITY</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Review of tariff-setting mechanism-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Review of tariff-setting mechanism)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry whether the Energy Market Authority will be reviewing the tariff-setting mechanism in determining the electricity tariffs to better reflect prevailing fuel prices in the market.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister&nbsp;for Trade and Industry):&nbsp;</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last parliamentary session, I had informed the House that the Energy Market Authority (EMA) would study whether the formula for tariff-setting can be further improved.&nbsp; Any change to the formula should take into <p align=left>Column: 714</p>account how electricity tariffs can be more reflective of the prevailing market&nbsp;price for oil, while minimising volatility so that consumers would not be faced with large adjustments frequently.&nbsp; EMA is now studying the tariff-setting formula, and targets to complete its review by the middle of next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the three-month forward fuel oil price has dropped significantly over the last month.&nbsp; Hence, as the Prime Minister mentioned yesterday,&nbsp;we can expect a reduction in the electricity tariff for the coming quarter of January to March 2009. &nbsp;Besides fuel costs, the electricity tariff also includes non-fuel costs of generation, transmission and distribution costs, and miscellaneous fees like meter reading and billing.&nbsp; The exact tariff will be known in the first week of December, after these components are computed and finalised.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade):&nbsp;</B> One supplementary question, Sir. I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether he agrees that the current formula is certainly deficient in that it does not address the intended objective of smoothening the impact of volatility of the electricity tariffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this revision that he is looking at&nbsp;be brought forward, instead of middle of next year, to a much earlier date?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple suggestion: as it is now, it is done every quarterly. One easy way is to just change it to monthly revisions. This will clearly ensure that we do not get to see some of these hefty hikes that we have seen of late.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B>&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, at the last sitting we had an extensive discussion on this.&nbsp; I do not propose to go into the full details but I thank the Member for raising this.&nbsp; I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;just&nbsp;highlight a few key points.&nbsp; Is the current formula deficient?&nbsp; I think we need to think about it in the context of what is the alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 715</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last session, we circulated a table chart showing the trend in the electricity tariff and oil prices. I think the key take-away from that is&nbsp;&ndash; using the formula that we have been using for the last four years or so&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;in these last 16 quarters, 11 have produced outcomes which&nbsp;are actually more favourable to consumers than if we had used spot oil prices&nbsp;&ndash; meaning the price of oil in&nbsp;a month&nbsp;&ndash; as the Member has suggested. The reason why&nbsp;this looks like a more attractive proposition today is because oil prices have come crashing down and so there is a disjoint between a price set based on a number that was determined three months ago as opposed to the current price. So, naturally, in a downward trend, this is going to be the case. So&nbsp;taking on the position that when we set&nbsp;a formula and when we review&nbsp;the formula, we need to look at the overall picture&nbsp;&ndash; not just&nbsp;at the current context but&nbsp;at the longer-term trends&nbsp;&ndash; to the best of our ability, and find a formula that will best serve our needs, both to protect&nbsp; consumer interests and at the same time, ensure the long-term viability of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the timing, the reason why it needs to go on till middle of next year is primarily because&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;as the Member would appreciate significant market sensitivity&nbsp;&ndash; many companies are involved and they base a lot of their decisions on this formula, amongst other things. So we want to make sure that we have done a deliberate consultative process before we come up with an outcome which all parties can subscribe to.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim</B> <B>:</B>&nbsp; Sir, I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether in&nbsp;EMA's review, it is also considering something like the fuel equalisation fund that the public transport operators maintain to tide over the volatility in fuel prices.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 716</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran:</B>&nbsp; If I understand the Member's point correctly, she is drawing the analogy from&nbsp;the transport system where the transport operators put money towards a fund which they then draw upon when there is volatility in the fuel oil price.&nbsp; We have done away with that in the electricity market for a simple reason. &nbsp;The objective is really to have a very competitive market and ensure that price competition, with a transparent pass-through of costs, would serve our interests best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other thing is if we insist that the electricity generating companies put money towards a fund of this nature, bearing in mind that the cost of fuel is more than half the cost of their total production,&nbsp;they will need a substantial allocation of their capital for this. Then, what we inevitably are doing, is imposing higher cost on them and this cost will be passed through to our consumers as well. So I do not want to preclude any options, but I just want to highlight to the Member that these are the downside risks of doing so.

As a result of the recent financial turmoil in the United States, several US-based companies have been adversely affected by the credit crunch.&nbsp; This has led to concerns about the financial health of the US-based Las Vegas Sands Corporation and any possible impact on its Singapore subsidiary&nbsp;&ndash; the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort.&nbsp; To address these concerns, Las Vegas Sands Corporation has embarked on a capital raising programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members would&nbsp;be aware&nbsp;of Mr Sheldon Adelson's, the Chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation,&nbsp;public affirmation of his commitment to the Marina Bay Sands project.&nbsp; We welcome Mr Adelson's strong commitment and look forward to his company doing what is necessary to see through the completion of the Marina Bay Sands project.&nbsp; The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) remains in dialogue with Marina Bay Sands and continues to work with them to facilitate the project's completion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Las Vegas Sands Corporation won the bid for the Marina Bay IR, it <p align=left>Column: 718</p>committed to complete the entire development by the end of 2009.&nbsp; The project has made good progress to date, despite the resource constraints arising from a tight construction sector.&nbsp; The current financial turmoil has introduced additional challenges for the parent company of Marina Bay Sands.&nbsp; They have therefore proposed a progressive opening of their development, a request which is being carefully considered&nbsp;by Government agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resorts World at Sentosa, which is developing the IR on Sentosa, has also requested a progressive opening of their development.&nbsp; Our understanding is that this request arose from some physical on-site constraints that the company encountered when constructing the Integrated Resort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The STB and other Government agencies are considering these requests by Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World at Sentosa with due reference to what they have committed as part of the Request for Proposal exercise.&nbsp; Even as we do so, our expectation remains that each development will open as an Integrated Resort, and not just as a stand-alone casino.&nbsp; If the requests are allowed, they will also be subject to various terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Eunice Olsen has also&nbsp;asked when the projected GDP contributions from the IRs would be achieved and if the IRs' business will be affected by the financial turmoil.&nbsp; It would be fair to say that due to the global financial crisis and the slowdown already evident in our tourism sector, there may be some impact on the IRs' business when they open.&nbsp; It is, however, premature to try to ascertain in quantitative terms what the exact impact will be given the volatility in the economic environment.&nbsp; What we do know is that both IRs remain optimistic that their product offerings will draw visitors from <p align=left>Column: 719</p>their target market segments.&nbsp;

Clearly, in evaluating all the proposals, the financial capability and the ability to organise financing was a&nbsp;consideration in deciding which bid was to be awarded.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was one of the considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the point to note&nbsp;here is, we are in now profoundly altered circumstances compared to when the IR&nbsp;RFPs went out, and the manner in which they were put together at that time. So, I think we have to recognise that the situation is fundamentally different in certain areas because&nbsp;these&nbsp;credit crunches that we&nbsp;see now are a result of quite a dramatic change&nbsp;seen in the US and the financial markets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that,&nbsp;I would want to&nbsp;stress that both IRs have secured&nbsp;project financing here in Singapore for their projects. And&nbsp;I think as far as we can tell, those project financing remains secured and that is the&nbsp;assurance they have given us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take some of the other questions first on the gaming area&nbsp;&ndash; have we somehow conceded&nbsp;something to the Marina&nbsp;Bay Sands because of the announcement that the number of gaming tables has been increased&nbsp;from&nbsp;600&nbsp;to&nbsp;1,000?&nbsp; The provision has never been on the number of tables.&nbsp; It has been on the floor area available for gaming activities <p align=left>Column: 721</p>and that number was 15,000 sq&nbsp;metres and that remains&nbsp;to be the case. So, the Casino Regulatory Authority has certain rules and guidelines required of Marina Bay Sands for compliance as it does for Resorts World and they maintain those requirements.&nbsp; There has been no change in that and in awarding the final licence,&nbsp;the layout, etc, would be&nbsp;reviewed and considered before the final casino licence is awarded.&nbsp; But the key point I want to stress is this that there is no change. It remains 15,000 sq metres, and if you look at that as a percentage of Marina Bay Sands' total development, which is, I think, in excess of 500,000,&nbsp;it is well within this 3%-5%&nbsp;range that has been quoted publicly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our projection for the GDP contribution from the IRs valid? As of now, MTI's view remains that in the steady state&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;because our projection was always based on in a steady state in 2015&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;when they are fully developed and running, the GDP contributions and the job creation numbers were based on that.&nbsp; And that remains our projection as in we say that in&nbsp;the steady state, we hold our view.&nbsp; But whether that would be achieved in 2015 or&nbsp;there may be some shifts because of changes in the industry and development, that is something we have to study and see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, finally, on whether Temasek will invest, I think that is a question for Temasek. It is a commercial company, and they make their own decisions.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several years back when Singaporeans were convinced that the IRs were the way to go, we were told that the job projections arising out of the IRs&nbsp;would be about 35,000 and because of the benefit of that, we should be prepared to accept some of the social ills from gambling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I note that&nbsp;in a&nbsp;parliamentary answer last year,&nbsp;the job projection was 20,000.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 722</p>I am just wondering whether MTI has further revised the job projection arising from the IRs now, in view especially of the increased number of gambling tables and whether we are going to see a higher price being paid in terms of the social ills arising from gambling.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Iswaran:</B>&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Member probably has not been following the numbers closely.&nbsp; Our job projection numbers have remained consistent.

Based on the feedback received, LTA is giving first priority to the retrofitting of school buses to enhance the safety of school children, as they are more vulnerable.&nbsp; However, one of the stakeholders' concerns with the implementation of seat belts is the reduction in the capacity of these buses when carrying children. Currently, three small children can occupy a seat which is&nbsp;meant&nbsp;for two adults.&nbsp; With seat belts, this is no longer possible and, as a result, some school children may be displaced from the buses they are currently taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three-year time frame for school buses to retrofit seat belts is to minimise the disruption to the transport of these children that are likely to be&nbsp;displaced. It takes into consideration the need for schools and school bus operators to have adequate time to reorganise the routes of buses with spare capacity or to introduce additional buses, as well as limitations such as the likelihood that retrofitting of school buses&nbsp;can only be&nbsp;carried out&nbsp;during school holidays and that the capacity of workshops doing&nbsp;seat belt retrofitting&nbsp;is limited. LTA will be working closely through the schools and childcare centres, and with the school bus operators, to schedule existing school buses for seat belts&nbsp;retrofitting within the three-year period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The five-year time frame for the remaining small buses takes into consideration the fact that priority will be given to school buses during the first three years, and the capacity of the workshops to handle the retrofitting work.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE BUSES-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE BUSES:::726-->\r\n\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 724</p><B>WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE BUSES</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Implementation details-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Implementation details)</span></B></div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

For a bus route to be wheelchair-accessible, two things must happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the buses plying the route must be wheelchair-accessible.&nbsp; The public transport operators are in the process of <p align=left>Column: 725</p>equipping new buses with wheelchair-accessible ramps, as they replace and renew their fleet.&nbsp; The Government is funding the capital cost of the ramps, which comes to about $21 million in total.&nbsp; By end-2010, 40% of our buses will have wheelchair-accessible ramps, and by 2020, all of them will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the bus stops along the route must be wheelchair-accessible.&nbsp; This involves replacing steps with ramps, removing potential obstacles and creating more space for wheelchairs to manoeuvre.&nbsp; The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is in the process of making all 4,500 bus stops in Singapore wheelchair-accessible by 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two sets of improvements, to the buses and the bus stops, are coordinated between the LTA and the public transport operators so that we can roll out as many wheelchair-accessible bus services as possible to best meet the needs of passengers-in-wheelchairs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criterion of requiring at least 80% of bus stops to be wheelchair-accessible, before designating the bus route as such, is to balance between the safety of passengers-in-wheelchairs and the speed of implementation.&nbsp; To fully ensure the safety of passengers-in-wheelchairs, ideally 100% of bus stops along a certain route should be made wheelchair-accessible before it can start serving passengers-in-wheelchairs.&nbsp; But we recognise that this will take some time.&nbsp; LTA had therefore worked with the VWOs representing passengers-in-wheelchairs, to find a way to accelerate the rollout of wheelchair-accessible bus routes without unduly compromising safety.&nbsp; It was after these discussions that all the parties concerned agreed to the 80% criterion, as a reasonable balance that can speed up the designation of wheelchair-accessible bus routes, while ensuring safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Mehta asked about information on wheelchair-accessible bus services.&nbsp; There have been extensive efforts to <p align=left>Column: 726</p>publicise WAB services through multiple channels such as news releases, educational pamphlets and information on online portals such as on SBST's website.&nbsp; The relevant VWOs have also helped to disseminate information to passengers-in-wheelchairs.</p>\r\n</div></span>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The data, coupled with psychologist reports that indicated that minors were typically unprepared for marriage, indicated to us that there was a need to send a strong signal to the community that minor marriages should be discouraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we therefore propose to raise the minimum Muslim marriage age from 16 to 18 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The minimum age of 18 years will be consistent with the minimum marriage age for non-Muslims under the Women&rsquo;s Charter.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only about 100 such marriages every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the impact of this move is in its signalling effect rather than preventing under-18 marriages from occurring, because those who are below 18 years of age can still marry with a special licence from a Kadi who solemnises Muslim marriages. This special licence is not new.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is already in place for Muslims wishing to marry under the current minimum age of 16 years, and there is a similar practice for non-Muslims <p align=left>Column: 730</p>under the Women&rsquo;s Charter, where the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports approves the special licence after reviewing the couples&rsquo; reasons for marriage and psychologist reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will fine-tune the special marriage licence process for underaged Muslim applicants to be in line with the process for non-Muslim underage marriages.&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures will help address concerns raised by some <I>asatizah</I> or religious teachers that this Bill may restrict Muslim rights, because Islam permits marriage upon reaching puberty.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, several Muslim countries have legislated a minimum marriage age that is at least on par with, if not stricter than, our proposal today.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in Morocco, the minimum marriage age is 18 years for both females and males; while in Algeria, the age is 18 years for females, and 21 years for males.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to raise the minimum marriage age is not intended to be a 'cure-all', nor will it replace existing programmes to address teenage sexuality issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will serve to complement existing programmes by giving parents and caregivers more influence when advising teenagers against marriage.&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of programmes in schools, the Community Leaders&rsquo; Forum has initiated supplemental programmes, such as Family Excellence Circles for parents to share best practices, and the Cool Teens programme for teenagers and their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS is also doing its part by including a sexuality education component in their aLIVE&nbsp;religious education programme for teenagers offered in our mosques.&nbsp; Sir, I am pleased to note that the Muslim community has taken ownership of the teenage sexuality problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am hopeful that the efforts will bear fruit in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to marriages, I would like to highlight two technical amendments to <p align=left>Column: 731</p>the Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the removal of the provision requiring marriages to be solemnised in the <I>daerah masjid</I>, or mosque compound, of the bride, as it is no longer relevant today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we propose to remove the provision allowing the Registry of Muslim Marriages to register marriages between Muslims and the <I>kitabiyah</I>, or People of the Book.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because the Registrar of Muslim Marriages only registers marriages where both parties are Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Improving the enforcement process for Syariah Court orders</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to another key amendment, which deals with the enforcement of Syariah Court orders.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, AMLA was amended to allow the enforcement of Syariah Court orders in the District Courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, we have received feedback on how the enforcement procedure for Syariah Court orders could be streamlined further.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to express my gratitude to the Muslim Law Practice Committee of the Law Society of Singapore, or MLPC.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MLPC had conducted a comprehensive study based on their experience on the ground with their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied their recommendations, and have accepted some of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Syariah Court orders will no longer need to be registered at the District Courts before they can be enforced by the District Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, this is an additional step that Muslims have to go through to enforce their Syariah Court orders in the District Courts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MLPC commented that the registration process is mostly administrative, and it is time-consuming and costly for their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;After studying the issue with the District Courts and the Ministry of Law, we found that it is possible to remove this <p align=left>Column: 732</p>registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that Syariah Court orders will henceforth be treated as District Court orders for the sole purpose of enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;With this move, Muslims can save both time and money if they need their Syariah Court orders enforced in the District Courts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, we propose to define Syariah Court orders for <I>nafkah iddah</I> and <I>mutaah</I> as maintenance orders solely for the purpose of enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;For those unfamiliar with the terms, <I>nafkah iddah</I> refers to the maintenance payable to the ex-wife under Islamic law, and <I>mutaah</I> is a consolatory gift to the ex-wife upon divorce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no straightforward enforcement mechanism for the breach of Syariah Court orders for <I>nafkah iddah</I> and <I>mutaah</I>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Court has a separate mechanism which allows divorced women to claim unpaid maintenance against their errant ex-husbands easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining orders for <I>nafkah iddah</I> and <I>mutaah</I> as maintenance orders will allow Muslim women to use this mechanism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Appointing a Deputy Registrar for the Syariah Court</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a related amendment, we propose to appoint a Deputy Registrar for the Syariah Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not because there is a backlog of cases at the Syariah Court.&nbsp; Rather, it is to enable someone to cover the Registrar&rsquo;s duties during her absence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when the Registrar is absent, a Syariah Court President covers her duties.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any appeal of the President&rsquo;s decisions in his capacity as covering Registrar would have to be heard by the Appeal Board, which is relatively inconvenient. &nbsp;If a person other than the President can cover as the Registrar in her absence, any appeal of the covering Registrar&rsquo;s decisions can then be heard by the Presidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment will allow the Deputy Registrar to exercise the powers and duties of the Registrar, where necessary. In addition, Sir, we propose to <p align=left>Column: 733</p>give both the Registrar and the Deputy Registrar the power to appoint <I>hakam</I>, or arbitrators, as this need not be done by the Presidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also take this opportunity to remove or amend several antiquated provisions relating to the Syariah Court.&nbsp; First, we will remove the Syariah Court&rsquo;s power to issue a Warrant of Seizure and Sale against the property of the defaulting party.&nbsp; This has not been used since 1999, because the Subordinate Courts can do this and the Syariah Court should not duplicate such powers.&nbsp; Second, we propose to remove any mention of divorce by Kadis as they no longer handle divorces.&nbsp; All divorces, Sir, now go through the Syariah Court.&nbsp; For the same reason, we will replace the provision requiring husbands who utter <I>talak</I> outside court to report it to a Kadi, with a provision requiring them to report the <I>talak</I> to the Syariah Court.&nbsp; Under Muslim law, <I>talak</I> means 'to untie the matrimonial knot by articulating a word denoting divorce'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, <I>talak</I> is uttered in the heat of anger, or over trivial issues.&nbsp; As such, we strongly discourage this practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Internationalising MUIS</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to amendments to strengthen MUIS.&nbsp; We propose to widen the scope of MUIS&rsquo; powers so that MUIS can share its expertise overseas.&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS has received many requests to share its expertise in areas under its purview&nbsp;&ndash; from its development of <I>wakaf</I> properties to the religious curriculum of its aLIVE programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a great source of pride for the community to see MUIS gain the reputation that it deserves overseas.&nbsp; This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s initiative to export public sector expertise. It may also generate revenue that can fund MUIS&rsquo; programmes back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 734</p>\r\n<p><I>Enhancing deterrence against breaching halal regulations</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment related to MUIS is to make it explicit in AMLA that individuals behind corporations, as well as the corporations themselves, can be prosecuted if they misuse MUIS' <I>halal</I> certificate or mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, AMLA does allow for this, but as Justice V K Rajah rightfully pointed out in a High Court case in 2006, the way AMLA is worded technically does not allow for the prosecution of corporate officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because it is the corporation that commits the offence, not the individuals holding office in the corporation&rsquo;s management.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, these individuals cannot be prosecuted.&nbsp;&nbsp;The maximum fine is $10,000, which may not be strong enough a deterrence, especially for large corporations. The Bill will make it explicit that individual actors behind the corporations may be prosecuted as well, and may face imprisonment of up to 12 months as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Justice Rajah for his astute observation and suggestion that AMLA be amended.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe every Muslim in Singapore will take comfort in knowing that the authorities take a serious view of a matter that is important to all Muslims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Allowing MUIS to compound lesser offences</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another minor amendment involving the enforcement of MUIS&rsquo; regulations is to allow MUIS to compound lesser offences. &nbsp;The benefit to MUIS is that it need not go to court every single time to enforce its regulations.&nbsp; This is a power enjoyed by many regulatory authorities, and MUIS will exercise it judiciously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also propose to amend AMLA so that the Mufti may recuse himself from the Fatwa Committee, or Legal Committee, in situations where he has a conflict of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Mufti has been summoned to court to give his <p align=left>Column: 735</p>opinion or evidence relating to Muslim Law, we propose that he be allowed to certify his opinion to the court or appoint someone to appear on his behalf unless the court directs otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because <I>fatwa</I> rulings are made in the name of MUIS, not the Mufti, and thus, where appropriate, it need not necessarily be him who has to appear in court.&nbsp; This provision will be used sparingly, and only with good reason.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Reviewing the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now explain the need to revise the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund, or MBMF. The MBMF facilitates Muslim employees to make regular, monthly donations towards mosque building. Established in 1975, it was expanded in 1984 to inject Mendaki with much-needed funds to run some of its programmes. Contribution rates to the MBMF were last raised in 2005 to address the cost and future needs of the mosque building programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In just 33 years, the MBMF has helped the community to build 22 new mosques in the satellite towns - no small feat considering the small size of the Muslim community in Singapore.&nbsp; The funds channelled to Mendaki have benefited over 153,000 students in the tuition programmes to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no plans to build more mosques in the near future, after the Al-Mawaddah mosque is built in Sengkang and another in Punggol, as no new housing estates are being built. There is, however, a need to upgrade older mosques to meet our community's needs. Some mosques that were built in the 70s and 80s are in urgent need of refurbishment or are no longer able to serve their communities well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 736</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I recently visited Al-Ansar Mosque in Bedok, which was built in 1981. The visit left a deep impression on me, and I am now more convinced of the need to upgrade the older mosques.&nbsp; Let me use Al-Ansar as an example.&nbsp; Al-Ansar is located on a slope, and its main prayer hall is located on the upper floor.&nbsp; Bedok is now a mature estate with an increasing number of senior citizens.&nbsp; Many of the elderly congregants have great difficulty climbing the flight of stairs to reach the main prayer hall. We will need to build a lift or escalator to enable them to do so.&nbsp; There are also frequent roof leakages which are costly to repair. We will need to perform extensive renovations on the dome just to solve this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Needs like those of Al-Ansar are not uncommon among MBF mosques built during the first and second phases, some of which are more than 30 years old.&nbsp; There is also a need to make such mosques as user-friendly as possible, given their expanding roles and functions. While their fundamental role is still as places of worship, mosques now play a part as centres for Islamic learning and social development.&nbsp; For instance, our mosques offer religious education programmes, and disburse financial aid to needy families in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; To cater to these functions,&nbsp;our mosques need to make their premises family-friendly, youth-friendly and community-friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is great difficulty in raising funds for mosque upgrading, which mosque volunteers are acutely aware of.&nbsp; During my consultations with Muslim community leaders, Haji Rahmat Sulaiman, a veteran leader and mosque volunteer himself, shared with me his difficult experience in raising funds to rebuild the Hasanah Mosque in Teban Gardens in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMLA currently does not allow MBMF to be used for mosque upgrading.&nbsp; Now <p align=left>Column: 737</p>that the mosque building is winding down, it is a good time to expand the usage of the MBMF for mosque upgrading. This will be restricted only to much-needed, large-scale ongoing and future projects to make our mosques more accessible and community-friendly.&nbsp; To ensure that the funds are directed to the most urgent needs, prior approval from MUIS has to be sought for each project.&nbsp; Mosques will continue to raise funds and pay for minor repairs and maintenance works themselves, as the MBMF will not be used for such purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mosque hardware alone is not sufficient to meet the needs of&nbsp;our community.&nbsp; It must be complemented by the 'software' of religious education.&nbsp; Religious education helps to inculcate moral values&nbsp;&ndash; especially in our young&nbsp;&ndash; thus, providing them with the compass for navigating through life's challenges.&nbsp; MUIS has developed programmes, such as the aLIVE programme, to teach our young Muslims to better understand, appreciate and practise Islam within the context of a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society such as Singapore.&nbsp; Besides upgrading the curriculum, we need qualified and well-trained religious teachers like <I>asatizah</I> to&nbsp;convey effectively the learning points to our students.&nbsp; The same applies to our full-time <I>madrasahs</I>, whose educational standards we have been trying to improve.&nbsp; Such capacity-building efforts are critical, for which more resources are needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religious education is a matter close to the heart of Muslim Singaporeans and we have received many good suggestions on how to fund it.&nbsp; Generally, the community agrees that there is a need for quality religious education programmes.&nbsp; Some have asked about the status of the Madrasah Fund, or Dana Madrasah,&nbsp;but this has not been as successful as the MBMF.&nbsp; The MBMF raises over $10 million a year compared to $1 million by Dana Madrasah. Some have commented that parents who send their children to <p align=left>Column: 738</p><I>madrasahs</I> should bear the cost since <I>madrasahs</I> are private schools.&nbsp; I agree with this to some extent, and note that <I>madrasah</I> school fees will be raised starting next year to ensure that parents pay a bigger share of the costs.&nbsp; But there is a limit to how much and how fast fees can be raised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite their private school status, <I>madrasahs</I> do not benefit only their students.&nbsp; The <I>madrasahs</I> produce religious teachers and scholars who will serve the entire community.&nbsp; Many of our top religious leaders such as Syed Isa Semait, the Mufti of Singapore, and Syed Ahmad, the Registrar of Muslims Marriages, had their early training in our <I>madrasahs</I>. With the MBMF funding, the <I>madrasahs</I> can improve the quality of education provided, and concentrate more on teaching their students well instead of fund-raising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced the Joint Madrasah System (JMS) that will take effect starting in 2009.&nbsp; This is a significant initiative that will require considerable funding especially in its start-up phase, mainly to upgrade the skills of <I>madrasah</I> teachers.&nbsp; It is reasonable to apply much of the MBMF funds for religious education towards the JMS in the near future.&nbsp; In meantime, the MBMF funds will also be made available to non-JMS <I>madrasahs</I> and part-time <I>madrasahs</I>.&nbsp; MUIS&rsquo; current efforts to upgrade all full-time <I>madrasahs</I>, including non-JMS <I>madrasahs</I>, especially in their PSLE-related efforts, will continue.&nbsp; For example, MUIS estimates that about 206 out of 240 <I>madrasah</I> teachers would have been professionally trained&nbsp; by 2009 compared to only 11 before 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have described how the MBMF will build the hardware and software of the community.&nbsp; For a comprehensive approach, we must also step up our efforts on the social front, to enable the vulnerable families in our community to <p align=left>Column: 739</p>benefit from these changes as well.&nbsp; We have been studying the trends of dysfunctional families within the Malay/Muslim community with Mendaki and the Syariah Court for some time now.&nbsp; A more strategic approach will make a more demonstrable impact in tackling the problem, given its prevalence.&nbsp; Our findings suggested that there was a need to provide a more holistic intervention to help Malay/Muslim families facing a range of difficulties.&nbsp; This was the key thrust of the Action Plan to strengthen Malay/Muslim families announced at the Community Leaders' Forum last November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of this Action Plan required expanding our reach to reconstituted families, given the prevalence of divorce and remarriages among Muslim divorcees.&nbsp; We need to focus on reconstituted families as they tend to face greater challenges.&nbsp; Currently, there is only one centre run by a Muslim organisation that provides support for such families, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.&nbsp; Located in Ubi Avenue, the As-Salaam Family Support Centre run by the Young Women Muslim Association, or PPIS, can only reach 17% of such families.&nbsp; I visited them last month, and I was impressed by the good work of PPIS.&nbsp; There is a critical need to open a second centre to double our reach to such families and equip them with the necessary skills. It is important that we act quickly to prevent an intergenerational transfer of dysfunctionality to the children of reconstituted families.&nbsp; Thus, we propose to set aside an additional $300,000 a year from the MBMF for all our programmes for dysfunctional families, including the new PPIS centre.&nbsp; This will relieve some of the burden of fund-raising for these programmes and complement Government efforts to tackle this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide greater funding to Mendaki to tackle the problem of dysfunctional <p align=left>Column: 740</p>families, together with its Community Leaders Forum partners, and to fund the two new components of mosque upgrading and religious education in the MBMF, we have found it necessary to ask for the contribution rates to be revised.&nbsp; The timing of this rate increase is not ideal, given the uncertain economic climate and inflation. But this is the best time to act.&nbsp; A delay will compromise the community&rsquo;s efforts and ultimately the long-term health of the community.&nbsp; The details of the proposed increase in contribution rates are already in the public domain.&nbsp; We have suggested a more equitable approach, where the lowest income band will not be affected by the increase, and the increase is larger for the higher income bands.&nbsp; I have sought the support of our community leaders to explain the need for the increase to their constituents, and I trust that the community supports the changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, at the core of these proposed amendments is the goal to uplift the Muslim community. We are proposing amendments today that will safeguard the well-being of members of the community who face greater challenges, such as minor couples, divorced women and their dependants and dysfunctional families. We are proposing amendments to strengthen our key institutions, such as MUIS and the Syariah Court.&nbsp; And we are proposing amendments to build the hardware and software of the community through mosque upgrading and religious education.&nbsp; The decisions we make today will benefit future generations, who will appreciate us for the sacrifices and difficult choices that we have to make, and the good work that we do to create a better environment for them.&nbsp; Sir, I hope the House will join&nbsp;me in supporting these key efforts in uplifting the Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 741</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.25 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, may I say <I>Assalamualaikum</I>.&nbsp; In today's world where Islamaphobia is still a problem that needs careful and sensitive handling, I am proud to say that we are able to discuss key and pertinent issues of&nbsp;the Administration of Muslim Law Act, or AMLA, without fear and prejudice.&nbsp; Indeed, with an open mind, free of the cobwebs of racial and religious discord present in many places in the region and in the world.&nbsp; I see the management and, worse, mismanagement of the issue of the administration of Muslim Law in the world as a possible time-bomb in many parts of the world, where Muslims live as siginficant minorities or even as majority population.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many&nbsp; non-Malay non-Muslim&nbsp; MPs here might take this AMLA Amendments as a Bill of interest as though to the Muslim community only, but it is worth noting that it has important and far-reaching significance to Muslim Singaporeans and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For sure, we&nbsp;are familiar with the branding \"Uniquely Singapore\" in terms of tourist attraction.&nbsp; Every year about 10 million tourists visit our Singapore for its varied attractions, including the racial and religious harmony we live with and which forms part of our branding.&nbsp; Members might still remember how I describe&nbsp;\"secularism with a soul\" as uniquely Singaporean, our own style of racial and religious harmony.&nbsp; The Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA), first enacted in 1968, provides for the establishment of MUIS to administer Muslim affairs, the appointment of the Registrar of Muslim Marriages (ROMM) and the establishment of the Syariah Court, and it is indeed&nbsp;a unique feature that reassures the Muslim community that its religion, Islam, and <p align=left>Column: 742</p>their Muslim way of life, have their rightful place in plural Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, you yourself have been our Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, and had been instrumental in initiating the process of earlier AMLA amendments. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the current Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,&nbsp; for taking these new initiatives, the second during his term, to introduce&nbsp;new amendments to ensure that AMLA remain relevant and effective.&nbsp; I do not need to emphasise the challenges faced by the Malay/Muslim community in the context of an ever-progressive Singapore, what more, in the context of&nbsp;our globalised world.&nbsp; The Malay/Muslim community has made credible strides to uplift in tandem with mainstream Singapore. Yet much more awaits in terms of meeting the challenges of the future and the community needs to streamline its machinery and enhance its programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The AMLA amendments today spell out the areas which need the community's urgent attention.&nbsp; They speak volumes of the challenges the community faces and without these amendments, the efforts to overcome them&nbsp;can be made a lot more onerous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As spelt out by Minister Dr Yaacob, the amendments would help strengthen family-related matters&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; raising the minimum marriage age for Muslims from 16 to 18, strengthening powers of the Syariah Court Orders, redefinition of&nbsp; maintenance for better protection of wives&nbsp;&ndash; and widen the scope of MUIS work related to <I>Halal</I> certification, <I>wakaf</I> and <I>haj</I> services.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are amendments in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMLA has been amended twice before in 1999 and 2005.&nbsp; I applaud these moves and would like to recommend that the community should not feel shy of further <p align=left>Column: 743</p>amendments, if and when necessary.&nbsp; Perhaps the Minister could look into the need for a mechanism to allow periodic scrutiny of AMLA and to allow MUIS and other AMLA-related&nbsp; agencies to be proactive in facing changes and challenges of the future.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow me, Sir, to focus on the amendment related to expanding the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF).&nbsp; I support the move to include the upgrading of old mosques in the MBMF and also the funding of religious education.&nbsp; With more uses envisaged, it is only right that the amount collected from Muslim workers should also rise.&nbsp; They make sense and is a logical progression to what we have achieved thus far.&nbsp; It is more than icing on the cake.&nbsp; It is like adding raisins and almonds to the cake of community development.&nbsp; I feel hungry already.&nbsp; [<I>Laughter.</I>]<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember when the MBMF was first introduced in 1975 to replace mosques torn down because of resettlement and to build new mosques in HDB&nbsp;satellite towns, there was a lot of unhappiness.&nbsp; It started with a contribution of just 50 cents per Muslim worker, collected through the CPF check-off machinery.&nbsp; This is something which was done, courtesy of our secular Government.&nbsp; It was not because of the amount, but trust was not there then. &nbsp;Some felt that the Government should pay for the mosques redevelopment, while others felt that the budding MUIS needed time to gain trust of the community then.&nbsp; But after a number of the new mosques were built, and the community could see for themselves the products of those contributions, confidence grew and trust began to be felt, so much so that when the call for more contributions was made, a vast majority responded positively.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 744</p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1984, the fund was enlarged to include contributions for Mendaki. This, to me, was a milestone as it was an important signal to the Muslims that their contributions and 'investments' should not only be made for the mosques&nbsp;&ndash; which many consider&nbsp;for purposes of hereafter&nbsp;&ndash; but also for their children's education, a call which began to be more pronouncedly felt in the '80s and '90s, especially with the formation of Mendaki.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, with your permission, I would like to speak in Malay.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Malay)</I>:&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_123834.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a><I>*.</I>]&nbsp; Sir, allow me to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has facilitated the work of Mendaki and all Malay-Muslim organisations for their efforts to improve&nbsp; the performance and prestige of the Malay-Muslim community.&nbsp; Allow me also to applaud the noble efforts of Mr Haji Mansor Sukaimi, former Member of Parliament for Kembangan, who passed away recently.&nbsp; He was among those who pioneered the setting up of Mendaki, and strengthened the efforts of our community towards excellence.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the proposal to amend AMLA to increase this contribution, both for redevelopment and upgrading of mosques, as well as for the needs of the <I>madrasahs</I>.&nbsp; After we had built 23 beautiful mosques in the HDB areas at a cost of almost $120 million, it is time now for MBMF to be used also to upgrade the existing mosques.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is especially important to uphold the good reputation of the existing mosques, because the eminence (<I>syiar</I> ) of the religion emanating from the mosques will not be preserved, if these mosques are not maintained and upgraded.&nbsp; If most Singaporeans want upgrading for their lifts and HDB flats, certainly mosques must not be left out.&nbsp; The inclusion of this effort as part of MBMF will enable this project to be implemented successfully and smoothly.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br><p align=left>Column: 745</p>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Yaacob also mentioned the development of Al-Ansar mosque. I myself was involved in the mosque building committee of the Al-Ansar mosque and we know how difficult it was to raise funds for the construction of this mosque. This mosque certainly needs upgrading.&nbsp; So, with the inclusion of this need into the amendment on AMLA, I am sure that this project can be carried out successfully.&nbsp; The incorporation of funding for religious education development under MBMF is most heartening to me. Although there are parties who will question the need, whether in terms of the number of students to be assisted, or in terms of a secular government allowing MBMF to be used for religious education, I think it is once again an example of how unique Singapore is.&nbsp; If the future of the <I>madrasah</I> education system is questioned by many around the world, whether it will be a breeding ground for terrorism, we in Singapore want our religious education system to succeed. Although the number of students who will benefit from this MBMF funding will be limited&nbsp;&ndash; which is 400 per year or 4,000 students generally&nbsp;&ndash; their impact on the religious lives of Muslims in Singapore is huge.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fully agree with what Dr Yaacob said&nbsp;&ndash; that religious education is very near and dear to the hearts of the Muslims here.&nbsp; But, certainly, there will be other questions raised, through the feedback received, on the amendments to the Act, not just why we should include funding for the <I>madrasah</I>, but also the amount of increase proposed, especially in difficult economic times.&nbsp; But I am sure that if this can be explained and clarified, most of the Muslims in Singapore will support it.&nbsp; And this, certainly, is for our common benefit.&nbsp; I see MBMF as a public <I>wakaf</I> system or \"people's <I>wakaf</I>\" (people's endowment trust)&nbsp;that we must ensure its success together.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If in the past, we had rich people who put aside their land or money for the <p align=left>Column: 746</p>building of mosque and <I>madrasah</I>, in this modern and sophisticated age where we have a fund-raising mechanism like the CPF, the MBMF should be maintained and further improved to fulfill the needs of a society that changes with the passage of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only one suggestion, Mr Speaker, Sir, that MUIS continues the effort to reach out to the community through its briefings, and use the available communication systems, including Friday sermons, to spread the message so that more of the community will fully understand the reasons behind these amendments.&nbsp; This important amendment needs not only the support of the Parliament but, most importantly, it must have the blessings and be embraced by our community.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I think all of us are well aware of the interesting, exciting and challenging times that we are living in.&nbsp; The amendments proposed to the AMLA Bill are necessary and timely.&nbsp; The Bill has to be current and relevant with the time, <p align=left>Column: 747</p>societal changes and challenges.&nbsp; In the current complex world, the family as a basic building block of society is often stretched and stressed.&nbsp; Parents are often at a loss on how to cope.&nbsp; We have seen often enough the problems faced by matured couples, not to mention the daunting challenges faced by young couples.&nbsp; This is more so for minor couples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, families, as&nbsp;the basic social institution in&nbsp;a community, play a pivotal role in contributing to raising healthy responsible members of society.&nbsp; Family breakdown and the social isolation of some families contribute to social problems in many communities.&nbsp; Sadly, Sir, the fragmentation of family life and the emergence of high number of broken and dysfunctional families are all too often the result of minor marriages.&nbsp; To put it simply, they are just not ready and prepared for marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a secure, nurturing home environment and healthy family life, the individual can naturally develop his or her sense of self-worth,&nbsp;sense of belonging and sharing,&nbsp;self-control, tolerance and a sense of morality and, not least in importance, cultivate feelings of affection and willingness to sacrifice for others.&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous studies have proven that dysfunctional family conditions contribute to future delinquency.&nbsp; Dysfunctional family members, especially children, are deprived from developing into rounded human beings.&nbsp; Ultimately, a broken nuclear family with no real support impacts the society negatively.&nbsp; It is almost certain that without support, the broken and dysfunctional family problem will perpetuate into the next generation, the vicious cycle of fragmented families will continue and the problem can never end.&nbsp; We should tackle this problem before it happens, upstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 748</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising&nbsp;that the issue of teenage sexuality, minor marriages and dysfunctional families have become the new social menaces that plague our community, we have to ask ourselves: have we done enough to tackle the problem and what more can be done to cause&nbsp;real change and positive impact?&nbsp; Thus, the proposed amendment to increase the minimum age for Muslim marriages from 16 to 18 is a welcomed change that is necessary to address the challenges that I have mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, Sir, I would prefer for the change to be more significant, that is, to move it to the age of 21.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, strong and stable families will build strong community and society, and it is, in my opinion, a crucial building block for the advancement of the Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp; Though the proposed changes are not going to be a panacea&nbsp;to the issues of teenage sexuality, minor marriages and dysfunctional families, it will definitely assist in minimising the formation of such family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Acting Minister for Manpower and Minister for Health (Mr Hawazi Daipi)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I rise to support the Bill and would like to give my comments on some key areas of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area is expanding the powers of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (\"MUIS\").&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded powers of MUIS contemplated by the Bill benefit Singapore and its Muslim community as it serves as a funding source for more and better quality services and programmes by MUIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 749</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision for MUIS to receive compensation for its products and services is&nbsp;a timely amendment, and allows MUIS to leverage on&nbsp;the know-how in selected key areas, for example, <I>halal</I> certification, <I>wakaf</I> property management and possibly also expert knowledge in Islamic banking and finance matters.&nbsp; These are areas in which MUIS can offer meaningful services to similar organisation in other Muslim communities in other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of products and services by MUIS would facilitate the generation of funds that can&nbsp;be channelled to finance&nbsp;the development of community&nbsp;programmes and activities, for example, the offering of more scholarships to develop expertise in areas such as legal, finance and the sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second area is&nbsp;recognising Syariah Court orders as District Court orders.&nbsp; This amendment is a long time coming.&nbsp; Currently, the Syariah Court order on its own does not stand as an enforceable court order and has to be registered at a District Court to be enforced.&nbsp; With the amendments introduced by the Bill, parties wanting to enforce a Syariah Court order would no longer have to go through a registration process at the District Court.&nbsp; The enhanced power of the Syariah Court and the resulting costs and time savings of registering a Syariah Court order are not only welcomed for its ability to raise the standing of the Syariah Court as a court of law, but for its ability to improve access to justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, power generally entails responsibility and this should be no exception.&nbsp; The Syariah Court has to operate at the highest level of efficiency and transparency on par with the District Court.&nbsp; For the Syariah Court to be viewed on par as the other components of Singapore&rsquo;s judicial system, it is important for the Syariah Court to seek ways to improve its administrative processes and the quality of the legal services it <p align=left>Column: 750</p>dispenses.&nbsp; I will highlight three areas to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the publication of the written grounds of decisions of the Syariah Court and the Appeal Board. The written grounds of decisions of the Syariah Court and the Appeal Board are not easily available to the public.&nbsp; I understand that the Syariah Court keeps a file of its written judgments as well as the Appeal Board&rsquo;s in hard copies in its premises.&nbsp; However, these judgments are not published in a book form, and are not available to the public online, or on the MUIS/Appeal Board or&nbsp; Syariah Court websites.&nbsp; I suggest that the written grounds of Syariah Court and Appeal Board decisions be easily made available to the public so as to enhance the transparency of the court and facilitate teaching and research.&nbsp; One way to do this is to upload the judgments on the MUIS/Appeal Board or&nbsp; Syariah Court websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the time-line of the appeal processes.&nbsp; Currently, there is no deadline set for the delivery of a Syariah Court's written judgment to the Secretary of MUIS.&nbsp; This may potentially hold up the appeal process.&nbsp; It is worthwhile to fix a deadline for the delivery of Syariah Court's written judgments to&nbsp;MUIS.&nbsp; In this way, a litigant (or potential litigant) would have a better sense of how long the appeal process would take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, ensuring that the Syariah Court is adequately staffed.&nbsp; As I mentioned earlier, it is important for the Syariah Court to seek ways to improve its administrative processes.&nbsp; To do this, the court needs to be adequately staffed.&nbsp; The appointment of a deputy registrar of the Syariah Court is to be welcomed, as it would lighten the existing administrative burden of the Syariah Court.&nbsp; However, it may not be enough to stop there.&nbsp; I would like to suggest that we investigate the workload of Syariah Court judges and <p align=left>Column: 751</p>consider whether there is a need to employ law clerks to assist the court with research and administrative matters.&nbsp; In addition, it is also important to plan for leadership renewal&nbsp;of the Syariah Court.&nbsp; I note that the key officers of the Syariah Court consist of officers who are retirees recalled for service or are close to retirement.&nbsp; It is imperative that we attract well-trained legal officers to serve the Syariah Court.&nbsp; As we all know, talent does not come cheap these days.&nbsp; In view of that, I think it is time we reviewed the compensation package&nbsp;of Syariah Court judges and other officers to ensure that we can attract promising young graduates to serve the Syariah Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third area that I want to talk about is the liability of officers of corporate bodies for breaching regulations relating to <I>halal</I> and <I>haj</I> matters.&nbsp; This is another amendment that is a long time coming.&nbsp; This amendment corrects an anomaly in the current law, which makes only offending individuals (and not individuals responsible for corporate bodies) liable to a jail term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Bill empowers MUIS to collect fines of up to $2,000, instead of having to commence court proceedings.&nbsp; The new powers of MUIS to collect fines reflect the unique role of MUIS in a multi-racial, multi-religious society.&nbsp; It is significant that while Singapore Muslims are a minority of the Singapore population comprising of approximately 14% of the population, the Bill envisages MUIS, a body regulating Muslim affairs, having the authority to fine anyone or any corporation&nbsp;who disrespects Muslims by misrepresenting <I>halal</I> certification&nbsp;or breaching other matters.&nbsp; To me, this reflects the Singapore Government's commitment to fostering respect for important religious practices and safeguarding the interests of minorities in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 752</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to speak on the fourth area of the Bill in Malay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_124118.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, this is regarding the expansion of the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF) to encompass the expenses of <I>madrasah</I> education and the rebuilding and upgrading of the mosques which are getting old.&nbsp; The Malay/Muslim community must support this effort because our community does not have many philanthropists who can give continuous support towards the various efforts to improve the progress and solve the problems of the community, including the institutions within the Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mosques and <I>madrasahs</I> are important institutions in the Muslim community and by contributing more to MBMF and&nbsp;widening its distribution, we will be able to enhance the performance of the <I>madrasahs</I> and its students, and the network for informal religious education in an informal way, and will also produce more religious teachers, leaders and administrators for the religious institutions in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is good that the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund&nbsp;can be used to upgrade the mosque facilities because many of our modern mosques are beginning to show signs of ageing. However, I hope MUIS will consider building one or two more new mosques in the estates where there is a high Malay/Muslim population, for example, in Woodlands New Town, where I am the Member of Parliament. I received a lot of feedback from the residents who said that there is still a need for another mosque to be built.&nbsp; I hope MUIS will study and consider this proposal or feedback. Although we will use a larger part of the MBMF for the renovation of the mosques and the use of the mosques, I also hope that MUIS will evaluate whether there is a need to build of one or <p align=left>Column: 753</p>two mosques in the housing estates that need new mosques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr. Speaker, I support this Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 853-854.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.13 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M):</B> (<I>In Malay</I> ):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;</I> <a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_124317.pdf\"\"><I>Appendix A</I></a> <I>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I support the&nbsp;amendment to the Bill, especially on the usage of MBMF for religious education.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 years have passed since the Fund was created. Who can imagine that a minority community with relatively less income, can collect more than $100 million and build 22 modern mosques that we can be proud of. Visitors are always amazed that we can build all those mosques based on sincere contributions and hard work by the Muslim community themselves, without receiving funds from overseas or the Government. This is the result of our community&rsquo;s cohesiveness and our leaders&rsquo; quick and correct actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, with the spirit and timely effort, and an effective method, we must overcome difficult situations faced by our <I>madrasahs</I>. If we used computer hardware as an anology to mosques, then our religious leaders are the content and software. And like a computer that cannot function without the best and latest software, the mosques and the Muslim community&rsquo;s actions also cannot function effectively and according to the present time, without religious leaders or thinkers of a certain calibre. Hence, the Muslim community cannot be led to think and act&nbsp;according to religious and national needs, to&nbsp;face the challenges&nbsp;posed&nbsp;to Muslims everywhere. Similarly,&nbsp;a computer&nbsp;must be free from dangerous viruses. In short, when faced with religious issues, it is the religious leaders' job to be the software to <p align=left>Column: 754</p>guard and and guide Muslims to be a religious community&nbsp;which is&nbsp;not influenced by radical doctrines that can destroy our community and beloved country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it is&nbsp;apt that the MBMF is also used to develop religious education for our children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Singaporean religious leaders must be aware of life in a multi-racial and modern society. I thank the Government&nbsp;once again for being concerned towards the needs of the Muslim community, by enabling and broadening the application of MBMF, through the CPF mechanism,&nbsp;and support not only its&nbsp;hardware but also&nbsp;its software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, the MBMF disbursement for religious education is not large. MUIS will spend $7 million towards <I>madrasah</I> needs, including this additional MBMF. This is a good improvement.&nbsp; I hope that with this disbursement, <I>madrasah</I> students do not have to collect donations every Friday at mosques&nbsp;around Singapore. However, the amount we receive, if this fund is given to full time <I>madrasah</I> students&nbsp;&ndash; 4,000 of them&nbsp;&ndash; will mean that each student receives $1,750, on average. This is still far&nbsp;lower than&nbsp;the allotment of $4,000 per student under the national schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is: what is the most prudent way to spend limited funds collected from our Malay/Muslim community for religious education purposes?&nbsp; Furthermore, we are not asking for Government funds, as we do not ask for funds to build our mosques, in line with the Government's policy.&nbsp; As stated by PM in his National Day speech,&nbsp;\"<I>Madrasah</I> is not part of the national school system, so it is difficult to justify Government funding.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, our community must be clear and wise about what should be achieved with a madrasah education system. Are our <I>madrasahs</I> an alternative education <p align=left>Column: 755</p>system to the national stream? Or maybe, for now, the fund should be disbursed to students who clearly have the ability and tendency towards mastering religious studies, and not be levelled with those who only want an alternative education system.&nbsp; In this matter, maybe we can use a Level of Service Framework, as put forward by Dr J D Treffinger. He explained that the rate of disbursement must be made effective at&nbsp;four levels, suited to the type of talent and tendency&nbsp;&ndash; a different disbursement rate for religious education for all, for many, for some and for the selected ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From one perspective, I hope MUIS will act wisely in disbursing funds to really talented students, with the potential to be the religious elite in our Malay/Muslim community. The funds received by these students must be sufficient to develop their potential to lead Malay/Muslims in Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From another perspective, for part-time religious students, parents must get assurance that their children's national education is strengthened with a system that can nurture moral and correct Islamic values, with a low cost. For those who want to further learn religious education with the part-time system, MUIS must create a similar system that can provide opportunities for those who are capable in the national primary schools, to enter the <I>madrasah</I> stream at Secondary level. This system is proven effective in countries like Brunei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I hope MUIS and the <I>madrasahs</I> receiving the funds will be transparent to the community, whenever the fund is used. My bigger hope is that the people's MBMF fund will be used for religious education that is optimum, systematic and effective,&nbsp;so that&nbsp;we can see the rise of Malay/Muslim&nbsp;public who are generally moralistic, and also able to <p align=left>Column: 756</p>produce religious elites of international standing that we can be proud of, just&nbsp;as we are proud of mosques that were built&nbsp;with MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I support the amendments to AMLA.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 855-858.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.20 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman):</B> (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_124451.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I support the amendments to the Administration of Muslim Law Act (AMLA) that were proposed.&nbsp; I like to put forward some issues related to the proposed amendments.\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, the Malay/Muslim community has long been burdened by many social problems that slowed our community's development&nbsp;&ndash; from drug abuse to youth delinquency, teenage pregnancy and juvenile crime, to the problems of high divorce rates and poor and dysfunctional families.&nbsp; All these are often linked to the problem of the failure of the institution of Malay/Muslim families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this happening when our nation is still overcoming the challenge of globalisation and competition in the global arena? Why are Malay/Muslim youths still said to over-populate the drug rehabilitation centres?&nbsp; Why is the rate of divorce still high among Malay/Muslims compared to other couples from other communities? Some proposed amendments in the AMLA aim to strengthen our society&rsquo;s system and social structure so that we can overcome these social problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I support the proposed amendments to increase the minimum marriage age for Muslim couples from 16 years to 18 years old. This sends a clear message that <p align=left>Column: 757</p>marriage at a young age carries a high risk.&nbsp; For example, figures show that 6.5% of Malay/Muslim marriages in 2007 involved women under 20 years old.&nbsp; At the same time, 20% of divorces among Malay/Muslim couples in 2007 occurred among women who married when they were under 20 years old.&nbsp; Among them, 67% have ex-husbands that were under 24 years old when they got married. Early marriages are not only high risk, but also bring a significant effect on the women involved, especially if she already has children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriages at a young age also mean that they are likely to have low education. Often they are given the custody of their children after the divorce.&nbsp; With low education due to their young age, they usually have problems supporting themselves as single mothers.&nbsp; They depend on financial support through the child support payment from their ex-husbands.&nbsp; But we always hear complaints from the single mothers because many have difficulty receiving this child support payment.&nbsp; Many have to keep going to the courts just to get the money.&nbsp; This problem is worsening and another AMLA amendment aims to solve it. I support the amendment to clause 12 which proposes that each Syariah Court's decision be treated as the District Court's decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, although the amendments to clause 12 may reduce the single mother's burden to get alimony from their ex-husbands, they still face another main challenge, that is, the ability of their ex-husbands to make the payment.&nbsp; Many of these ex-husbands are unable to give sufficient alimony.&nbsp; There are two reasons for this: first, insufficient income; and second, the economic situation being made complicated with the status of those who have remarried and have new responsibilities.&nbsp; Here I feel that the AMLA amendments do not give enough attention to the issue of the men's responsibility to play their roles after the divorce.&nbsp; I suggest <p align=left>Column: 758</p>to the Minister to study how we can continue to enhance the present system to increase the level of responsibility of these men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, the rate of remarriages among these men is also high.&nbsp; In 2007, 24% of Malay/Muslim's marriages involved men who have previously divorced.&nbsp; It means that if they have children from this marriage, and burdened by insufficient salaries or not being present in their children's lives, most likely they will be unable to play their roles as fathers to children from their first marriage, like paying alimony and child support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What will happen to the ex-wives who were given custody of the children?&nbsp; Most likely, they will remarry again. One reason is that they need someone to rely on.&nbsp; In 2007, 25% of marriages involved women who had previously divorced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, for 2007, I found that around 1,450 marriages occurred when one partner has divorced before, and among them, 40% or 560 couples are couples where both partners have divorced before.&nbsp; Such families are called reconstituted families and many social workers find that such families are high risk as the dynamics within the families are too complex and difficult to handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit that not all reconstituted families are problematic but figures related to problematic youths, school dropouts and so forth show that they come from the reconstituted family structure, where there are divorces, remarriages and sometimes also re-divorces.&nbsp; The result is unstable households and families.&nbsp; I have met a young grandmother who has married thrice.&nbsp; She said that her eldest child has seven children from four marriages and divorces.&nbsp; The eldest son of that child is in the Singapore Boys' Home while the second one is in the Singapore Girls' Home.&nbsp; The third child is already not <p align=left>Column: 759</p>schooling at 13 years old.&nbsp; We often see this scenario among Malay dysfunctional families. What must we do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, recently there is the issue of whether Malay men are considered to be the main cause of social problems among Malay/Muslims.&nbsp; The issue is the responsibility of these men in the institution of family, and their ability to play their roles as the leader and pillar of the family.&nbsp; This means that it is important for us to strengthen the men by increasing their skills to overcome challenges in marriages and families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for those who are divorced, the message is that their responsibility as fathers does not end at the point of the divorce.&nbsp; In fact, their responsibility will continue even though they have divorced or married again.&nbsp; Paying the alimony is only one of their roles.&nbsp; Their role as fathers, leaders and so on must be continued.&nbsp; But often we find that they failed to play this role after they remarried.&nbsp; Thus, we have to think of strategies to overcome this issue - how we can ensure that the men continue to play their role effectively after the divorce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I feel that the community must also play an important role in this issue.&nbsp; We must send a clear message to the men that they must not conveniently take the decision to remarry after their divorce, if they are unable to pay child support for their children from their previous marriage.&nbsp; Maybe an assessment system can be created to ensure that men who want to marry again must show their ability to continue fulfilling their children&rsquo;s needs. We need a long-term plan to ensure that the future of these children from the divorces continues to be secure, and we halt the process of dysfunctional families in the next generation.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 760</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the MBMF that was changed, this Fund is disbursed for social programmes that are being coordinated by Mendaki.&nbsp; There are segments of the community who asked why the MBMF must be raised and used for Mendaki's social programmes. I feel that we all agree on the importance of the Fund to be channelled into programmes that aim to overcome the social problems of the Malays.&nbsp; We will continue using national resources but the provision of the MBMF for these programmes also demonstrates to the Government and other races that the Malays are also concerned, responsible and want to contribute towards the process of overcoming our own community's social problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Action Plan to Strengthen Malay/Muslim Families that is being coordinated by the Community Leaders' Forum, we need funds to implement new programmes, like the one detailed by the Minister previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, while distributing resources to overcome the Malays' social problems, one of the challenges we face is how the resources are used.&nbsp; Overcoming this social issue is a complex process and needs special expertise.&nbsp; Engaging and helping dysfunctional families with multiple problems, like pregnancy, juvenile delinquency and heads of family in jail, is not something that can be done by a volunteer who is sympathetic and wants to help.&nbsp; It needs the skills of a trained professional social worker.&nbsp; The process of helping these people with problems needs a systematic assessment and comprehensive action plan.&nbsp; These trained experts need a lot of resources.&nbsp; Many think that social workers do not need high salaries as it is their job to help the community.&nbsp; Some also feel that such work can be done by volunteers.&nbsp; But the fact is that we need expertise and a lot of resources to implement social programmes that aim to overcome our community social problems.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 761</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also have to create proactive programmes to encourage more young people to participate in social work and make it a career.&nbsp; Our community really needs these professional workers.&nbsp; The number of Malay/Muslim social workers is too little to meet the community's needs.&nbsp; We will still need funds to create the programmes, including funding these expert workers.&nbsp; We hope the community will support the proposal so that part of the MBMF will be used for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, the social issues that still burden our community cannot be overcome in just one day.&nbsp; But the proposed amendment that is related to marriages and the MBMF provision shows our community's concern to take a proactive attitude in facing social issues.&nbsp; I support this amendment.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 859-866.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.32 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, some say that the strength of a community lies in the strength of its families and institutions.

These are noble causes which I support as they are critical for the building of a progressive and resilient Muslim community, especially in the face of many challenges brought about by globalisation.&nbsp; However, allow me to address some concerns I have regarding several aspects of the amendment.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The move to increase the minimum marriage age for Muslims from 16 to 18 years old will put AMLA in line with the Women's Charter in Singapore.&nbsp; I support this change as it will go some way in addressing the problems of teen marriages, many of which end in quick divorces.&nbsp; After going through the <p align=left>Column: 762</p>motions, many teenagers, especially the younger ones, may find themselves unprepared for the rigours and demands of married life and parenthood and, hence, making their marriages more susceptible to breaking apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there are many reasons for teenage marriages, some of them occur out of what is perceived as a \"necessity\" due to the presence of a baby conceived out of wedlock.&nbsp; In the Muslim community, bearing a child out of wedlock is seen as religiously and culturally undesirable. Hence, women caught in this situation are often stigmatised and pressured. They are often left with no option but to carry on with the pregnancy, as abortion is also frowned upon by the community.&nbsp; Some parents feel that marrying off their teenage children caught in such situations will instil some sense of responsibility in the couple, while shielding them from being shamed by the community.&nbsp; The reality is strong teenage marriages are often hard to come by, especially in the absence of solid social and family support networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the increase in allowable marriage age, Muslim women who find themselves bearing a child out of wedlock at age 16 or 17 may be faced with an even bigger conundrum. They may eventually be left with the option of bearing the child as a single mother because marriage would not be an option for them even if their partner may wish to marry them.&nbsp; In such circumstances, which I suspect will not be uncommon, I would like to ask the Minister what forms of social support will be made available for such young unwed Muslim mothers. I would also like to know&nbsp;whether the&nbsp;current shelters for such women are operating at maximum capacity and, if so, what measures will be taken to ensure that existing VWOs are able to meet the need should there be an increase in numbers of single unwed mothers needing <p align=left>Column: 763</p>shelter or support.&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister if the proposed Casa Raudha, a shelter meant for battered women, will admit young single mothers who have been turned away from their families due to such circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also note that the amendment provides for a <I>kadhi</I> to allow underage marriages under a special licence. I would like to ask the Minister under what circumstances would such special licences be granted. May I&nbsp;also&nbsp;know how many special licences for underage non-Muslim marriages have been given out by the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, and under what circumstances were these licences granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to another aspect of the amendment, I would like to address concerns on the implementation of an upward revision of Muslim workers' contribution to the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF).&nbsp; Sir, the MBMF has played a crucial role in providing funds for the building of mosques in Singapore and in supporting the needs of community organisations through Mendaki.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;some have questioned if the MBMF is in a dire state that the increase has to be done while the world is on the brink of experiencing what analysts have termed to be possibly the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&nbsp; Uppermost on many Singaporeans' minds are whether they will be able to keep their jobs in the face of a looming economic downturn.&nbsp; Many have started to tighten their purse strings and are finding ways to economise and stretch every dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is never a good time for any price increase, I would argue that there certainly are really bad times to do so, especially for the most financially vulnerable&nbsp;&ndash; in this sense, the lower-income workers. Under the proposed <p align=left>Column: 764</p>revision, the largest portion of the burden of the hikes rightly falls on those earning higher incomes. Workers earning $1,001 to $2,000 will contribute the lowest amount of increase, that is, 50 cents more than the current contribution of $2 per month.&nbsp; At the top end, those earning $4,001 and above will contribute the biggest increase of $5, bringing their total contribution to $16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I note that the last round of hikes to the MBMF in 2005 was done only for workers earning $2,001 and above.&nbsp; In the light of a gloomy economic outlook, I would like to suggest that the same be done this time around so that workers earning between $1,001 and $2,000 are spared from increasing their contributions.&nbsp; Instead, the increased amount of $0.50 should be channelled to those earning $4,001 and above as this group of employees are not likely to be as heavily impacted by the current crisis. Another suggestion is to add another tier at the top&nbsp;of those earning more than $6,000 monthly contributing a larger amount to the fund, perhaps up to a total of $20, or even $25, a month. The increase at the top end could help offset the loss in doing away with the contribution at the bottom end if this proposal can be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, while I do understand&nbsp;the need to upgrade and repair old mosques, I would like to seek assurance from the Minister that only mosques with urgent upgrading needs are considered for upgrading work during this difficult period. Other non-critical upgrading needs can be shelved to a later period in better economic times.&nbsp; At the same time, I would also like to seek assurance that mosques in Singapore will continue to be prudent in their spending and in managing donations from the public.&nbsp; Sir, I say this because in recent years, there were reports of a few mosques with installations of fancy chandeliers and luxurious expensive carpets. While the public contributes towards the upgrading <p align=left>Column: 765</p>of old mosques, it is only fair to ask the mosques to be prudent in managing their needs and wants, even when items are donated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One other aspect which has drawn attention from the public is the proposal to use a part of the MBMF for funding teaching and training programmes in <I>madrasahs</I>.&nbsp; I understand and believe in the need for a collective approach in the funding of religious education for Muslims in Singapore. The community, as a whole, will benefit from having better qualified <I>Ustaz</I> and <I>ustazahs</I> in our <I>madrasahs</I>, in addition to having a religious elite and an exemplary <I>madrasah</I> education system, which can be seen as a model by other secular nations with Muslim minorities.&nbsp; However, this view may not be shared by every contributing Muslim worker, as only a small percentage of Muslim children study in <I>madrasahs</I>. I would like to propose that an opt-out component be considered for contribution to <I>madrasahs</I> so that those who have reservations in having their fund contribution channelled to <I>madrasahs</I> can continue contributing to the mosques and Mendaki, since these are causes we already support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of utilising the funds for <I>madrasahs</I>, I would like to ask the Minister for greater transparency on the financial situation of our <I>madrasahs</I>, especially the three under the Joint Madrasah System (JMS) which are given priority in maximising the funds from the MBMF.&nbsp; I understand that school fees for <I>madrasahs</I> are quite high, at an average of $70 a month per child. Yet, many <I>madrasahs</I> have&nbsp; frequently resorted to having donation drives due to lack of funds.&nbsp; It would be beneficial if information on the spending profile&nbsp;by the <I>madrasahs</I>, the sources of their funding, and the steps taken to be more prudent in their expenses could be provided.&nbsp; I feel that it is useful to make such information public so that fund contributors can convince <p align=left>Column: 766</p>themselves that the <I>madrasahs</I> are worthy of support by everyone in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I see the critical need for the <I>madrasahs</I> to change in their manner of operations and be more proactive in engaging the public so that the latter forms part of their direct stakeholders.&nbsp; In a sense, <I>madrasahs</I> should not be totally private institutions and should open themselves up to greater accountability and transparency to gain more trust from public contributors. They should also not remain as merely religious education providers but must actively transform themselves into dynamic stakeholders in the process of shaping and building a progressive Islamic community in a secular society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.42 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I rise in support of the amendments to the Administration of Muslim Law Act.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A key amendment is to expand the use of the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund to cover upgrading of mosques and funding of religious education in Singapore.&nbsp; To provide for this expanded use, the monthly contributions of Muslim workers to the MBMF will be increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expanding the use of MBMF to cover mosque upgrading has been well received by the community.&nbsp; This is a timely move for the reasons already mentioned by the Minister earlier on.&nbsp; Also, the role of mosques has changed.&nbsp; Since the beginning of this year, mosques have been playing a bigger role in the social welfare network for Malay/Muslims and have taken over the social assistance functions previously concentrated at MUIS, expanding the use of the MBMF to cater to this wider need is therefore urgent and necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 767</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, unlike the proposal to expand the MBMF to cover mosque upgrading where there is a strong consensus, the expansion of MBMF to cover&nbsp;religious education has received mixed reaction, although the majority supports it.&nbsp; Some in the community have reservations because they feel that parents do have a choice whether to put their children in <I>madrasahs</I> or Government schools which provide a very good education. So, they feel that they should not be asked to bear the cost of parents making personal choices when they put their children in <I>madrasahs</I> as these parents should bear the full cost. But even such critics agree wholeheartedly that there is a need to improve the quality of <I>madrasah</I> education. So, it would appear that there is no disagreement on the objective of improving <I>madrasah</I> education but the disagreement is on how this should be funded&nbsp;&ndash; by every Muslim worker or by the parents themselves. The unspoken, implicit point here also is that almost everyone agrees that <I>madrasah</I> education is important for the whole community as we need good quality and well-trained <I>asatizahs</I> to provide for the religious needs of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let us face the reality squarely&nbsp;&ndash; if parents have to pay for the full cost of <I>madrasah</I> education, many will not be able to afford it. Also, the quality of <I>madrasah</I> education will continue to decline. Worse still, some who really want a religious education for their children may opt to send them to <I>madrasahs</I> elsewhere in the region which is cheaper but where we have no influence whatsoever on the curriculum or the quality.&nbsp; Hence, we need to look at this issue in perspective&nbsp;&ndash; although only a small number of children attend <I>madrasahs</I>, having a good quality <I>madrasah</I> education is for the benefit of the entire community unless we want to import <I>asatizahs</I> who are not familiar with our own context and may do more harm <p align=left>Column: 768</p>than good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But good quality <I>madrasah</I> education is not cheap and, therefore, we need every working member of the community to share in this investment in good quality <I>madrasah</I> education to meet the future needs of the community.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is also another point that has arisen in this debate which we need to address.&nbsp; There have been calls for greater transparency and accountability on the use of the MBMF from various quarters.&nbsp; We should not dismiss these concerns as they are valid because MBMF funds are raised from the public.&nbsp; This is not to suggest that MBMF funds are not properly accounted for, or there is abuse in the use of such funds.&nbsp; Far from it, the use of funds under MBMF is properly audited and contained in annual reports of MUIS and Mendaki that anyone is free to inspect.&nbsp; However, I think that what the community is asking for is something more than this, as the reports are only available after the end of each financial year.&nbsp; Perhaps MUIS and Mendaki could think of how to share, at regular intervals, with the community, details on how the funds are used as well as the progress made under the different programmes that tap on the MBMF.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also think that it would be useful if the beneficiaries or intended beneficiaries of the MBMF such as the <I>madrasahs</I> themselves adopt a more open approach to sharing of information and present a more friendly face to the public.&nbsp; For example, <I>madrasahs</I> could organise open houses for the public to share what they have been doing, how their students are faring, what they are doing to integrate their students with the mainstream Singapore society, and even showcase examples of successful <I>madrasah</I> graduates.&nbsp; I think that this will go a long way in generating greater confidence and support for the use of the MBMF in the expanded areas such as <I>madrasah</I> education, although with an increasingly better educated Malay community, the <p align=left>Column: 769</p>same argument could also apply for the other uses as well.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the MBMF are public funds, there is also a need to ensure that it is used prudently, especially now that the use has been expanded and the contributions will be increased.&nbsp; As mosques will now get up to 80% of the funding for upgrading, some in the community have asked whether there are any controls as to what kind of improvements the MBMF will cover.&nbsp; Who decides, for instance, whether a particular upgrading work is necessary or is actually an extra that we can do without, as increasingly the sense is that mosques have gone beyond the basics?&nbsp; We want our mosques to have modern facilities, are warm and friendly to meet the different needs of the community, but it should not be too luxurious as maintenance cost will be high.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister could also elaborate on what mechanisms are in place to ensure that the MBMF funds are prudently used.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, we are in no doubt that the increase in the MBMF contributions is necessary. However, the timing is a bit unfortunate as people are concerned over their jobs in the current economic downtown.&nbsp; I believe that the increase is still affordable for most as it affects only those earning better incomes.&nbsp; Moreover, the current downturn is expected to last for quite sometime and, therefore, if we wait for things to be better, it would seriously affect programmes for the community.&nbsp; So, I urge everyone to give their full support to the higher contribution rates as well as the expanded use of the MBMF.&nbsp; I also believe that many Muslim workers are already paying more than the minimum.&nbsp; It would help if the Minister could share with this House how many Muslim workers have paid more than their minimum and by how much more.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now speak in Malay.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>(In Malay</I>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_124637.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, <p align=left>Column: 770</p>I rise in support of the amendments to the AMLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expanded use of the MBMF to strengthen families is very necessary and therefore, most welcome. The MBMF will now cover efforts to prevent early marriages and the high divorce rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These efforts are useful and two amendments to the AMLA, in particular, would facilitate efforts in strengthening families and preventing high divorce rates. First, the amendment to raise the minimum marriage age for Muslims from 16 years to 18 years. Currently, Muslims have the lowest minimum marriage age compared to the other communities. At the age of 16, many are still in school or are not fully mature to cope with the very complex responsibilities arising from marriage and subsequent parenthood. The statistics on early marriages reflect this. Young couples suffer from a higher divorce rate compared to those from the older age groups. The problem is compounded when they have children and are unable to provide for their children due to their low education and low skills, and they cannot find proper jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, a change in legislation solely is not enough to change the attitude of our community towards the issue of early marriage and parenthood. We require a whole mindset change. In education, our community no longer discriminates between girls and boys and both are sent to school. But what we need to see more of is the community putting greater support towards women having a career and contributing to the family. For now, only 12% of Muslim households have two or more working persons.&nbsp; This leads to two-thirds or 67% Malay families having a household income that is much lower than the national average, as the other communities have more working women. For instance, in the Malay community, 54% of the women are economically <p align=left>Column: 771</p>inactive compared to 37% for the Chinese and 48% for the Indian communities.&nbsp; I see this mindset reflected repeatedly in the Back to Work Programme that we organise both at the NTUC and under the Employability Network of the Community Leaders' Forum. There are husbands who oppose their wives working although it is obvious that their income is too low to support the family. And there are schemes, such as KIFAS and CFAC, where they can put their children in child care centres at little or no cost when the wives are working, so that their children's welfare is not abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may ask what has this got to do with the prevalence of early marriages and teenage pregnancies in our community. I suspect that the lower value that we attach to women working and holding their own career in our community has an effect on the kind of values that our young girls hold, until they become predisposed to early marriages and early pregnancies, rather than thinking of how to work, pursue a career and be self-reliant. In my view, we need a more open discussion in the community on how the values, perceptions and biases that we hold can influence and have an impact on the values of our young girls, regarding marriage and having children at a young age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also welcome the amendment that helps women claim maintenance from their husbands. Under this amendment, there will no longer be a need for such women to register a Syariah Court order in a District Court before it may be enforced by the District Court. This will significantly cut down the time and hassle for the women, in particular, to enforce the Syariah Court awards on custody or maintenance. The running around, which most women currently have to suffer, is most frustrating and not helpful at all. These women are already facing an uphill <p align=left>Column: 772</p>task in getting maintenance for their children. Thus, the more barriers to enforcement that we can remove, the better it will be for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, having more funds alone is not the answer. While we help dysfunctional families, we also have to ensure that we do not end up making them dependent on assistance only, as we need to help them build their own resilience and self reliance. Financial assistance schemes should be tied to willingness to work and upgrade their skills. In this way, we help them in a more sustainable manner and not just to meet their immediate needs. It should also be based on efforts that ensure their children stay in school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in helping dysfunctional families, there is a need to adopt a case management approach and not just financial assistance. So I hope that the additional funds raised under the MBMF will be used to train more counsellors so that they can follow through the cases as most dysfunctional families have multiple problems which are interrelated, such as drug addiction, low educational achievements, unemployment, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we are in the midst of an economic downturn. I urge the community to be prepared before the thunderstorms hit us.

All these contribute towards the vicious cycle just described.&nbsp; In line with these observations, it seems in order to raise the minimum marriage age&nbsp;&ndash; whilst our community is not against building and forming families&nbsp;&ndash; it is important for us to help ensure marriages last&nbsp;and perhaps remain forever.&nbsp; It is something we have <p align=left>Column: 774</p>to do earlier rather than later.&nbsp; But will we see the positive changes we expect?&nbsp; Perhaps not so fast either.</p>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More importantly, the proposed new requirement is a move towards giving a clear signal to the community that minor marriages are not encouraged because they are more likely to end in divorces.&nbsp; However, these amendments must be coupled with targeted public education and awareness, education of families and teens, bridging the generation gap, correction of certain mindsets and attitudes, keeping youths in school and having a strong foundation in religious education and understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp; The multi-faceted and multi-targeted approach we have today needs to be reinforced, consolidated, and be made more practical and accessible.<br>\r\n&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a positive move to streamline and cut a so-called \"red tape\" procedure as these cases can be managed in a secular fashion similar to the way they are handled for non-Muslims.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.00 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Divorced Muslim women are already facing many problems as it is, so why do we need to add to their difficulties in order for them to get their errant ex-husbands to keep up with maintenance payments?&nbsp; The current process costs money and time, so cutting down on these additional steps will indeed be a welcome change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will be in line with broadening the horizon of the Singapore Muslim, giving greater exposure to our officers on the global stage and widening our mindsets through networking and sharing of ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many countries, including Muslim countries, Sir, have voiced interest to <p align=left>Column: 775</p>share our policies and approaches in a Muslim community embedded in a secular nation.&nbsp; These have been tried and tested to a certain extent and they are current, updated and practical when it comes to execution.&nbsp; After all, we in Singapore are known not just to talk but also&nbsp;with our follow-up actions as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;my many&nbsp;trips to the Middle East, I was asked how Muslims&nbsp;in Singapore, in particular women, deal with westernisation and globalisation and adapt to a rapidly changing world, yet at the same time keeping our Muslim identity.&nbsp; These are exactly the principles we could share through our MUIS' brothers and sisters.&nbsp; Finally, I would also like to reinforce that we must include women on these teams that we send abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would, however, like to add&nbsp; a word of caution&nbsp;as these topics&nbsp;that we are going to&nbsp;discuss would certainly&nbsp;be sensitive, and our practices may be very \"local\" and&nbsp;have differences which may have to be handled with tact and diplomacy.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will continue the last part in Malay, Sir.&nbsp; This is on the MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_124857.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Although our community generally supports the broadening of the MBMF&rsquo;s usage, some are still querying its details.

To me, MBMF can be described as a proof of the Malay/Muslim community&rsquo;s success, and that made MBMF an icon of our community's self-help spirit, apart from reflecting the community&rsquo;s excellence to sacrifice for the nation&rsquo;s and community&rsquo;s interests. Through this debate on amendments to AMLA, I would like to touch on a few issues on MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, I would like to touch on the mosque improvement component.&nbsp; As mentioned by the Minister earlier, I believe that this programme is essential, as local mosques are getting older, and I believe this programme will receive strong support from the Malay/Muslim community. Many mosques built in the 70s and 80s have shown signs of wear and tear, and some parts of buildings are damaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An example will be the Al-Ansar mosque in Bedok North built in 1981. It needs repair and improvements. Some parts of the mosque are damaged, and repairs will be costly. Also in Bedok, there is an increasing number of elderly residents. Many find it difficult to climb stairs to the main prayer hall. In this regard, improvements are needed to help them.&nbsp; I have met many of the Al-Ansar mosque&rsquo;s congregation who shared their joy with me after watching and listening to the National Day Rally last August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, I would like to touch on MBMF's usage to solve the issue of dysfunctional families. Dr Maliki Osman, MP for Sembawang GRC, together with me, is co-chairing the Family Development Network under the Community Leaders' Forum.&nbsp; We feel that assistance and sufficient resources are needed to render effective assistance to Malay/Muslim dysfunctional families, who are largely poor families too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our committee has visited Family Service Centres and other social <p align=left>Column: 778</p>organisations to further understand this issue. As a result, I further understand why we need to include the issue of dysfunctional families into the new MBMF initiatives.&nbsp; The programme to help dysfunctional families needs a huge boost in terms of resources, staff and funds. Without sufficient financial resources, it is difficult to run programmes to help these dysfunctional families become independent or possess skills to take care of their families or themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I really hope the public will understand this and give their support so that the Malay/Muslim community can advance together without anyone left too far behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please allow me to continue in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; Sir, thirdly, I feel that we should continue our engagement with the Malay/Muslim community&nbsp;to enhance the awareness of the significance and role of the MBMF.&nbsp; During my engagement with the Malay/Muslim community with regard to the current amendments, I sense that many of the older segment of the community are aware and feel for the MBMF.&nbsp; Specifically, I felt&nbsp;touched when a few of them mentioned that the changes to the MBMF show the vision of the Government leaders aimed at developing a Malay/Muslim community of excellence.&nbsp; However, I also sensed that there is a segment of the younger generations of the Malay/Muslim community who may not have the same sentiment as their older counterparts. &nbsp;I have met a few who are passive contributors who contribute a part of their monthly income when they start working without realising or understanding the real importance or impact of their contributions through MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This understanding is important as with greater knowledge about the MBMF, more people will be aware of the role and <p align=left>Column: 779</p>significance of the MBMF and give their&nbsp;support.&nbsp; They will take ownership of the MBMF and ensure its success as the MBMF continues to support the Malay/Muslim community to aspire and excel towards a higher level of excellence.&nbsp; In 10 to 20 years in the future, the younger donors will form the main contributors of the MBMF and they would be more ready to support the initiatives and programmes that will contribute towards the success of the Malay/Muslim community and our nation.&nbsp; On this issue, I would like to ask the Minister what are his plans to sustain and enhance the contribution of the Malay/Muslim community towards the MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I feel that the MBMF should not only be retained but strengthened.&nbsp; With the MBMF, the progress of the Malay/Muslim community would continue with greater rigour.&nbsp; At the same time, we have to ensure that the MBMF stay relevant and supported by the Malay/Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I support the Bill.</p>\r\n</P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 873-874.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Hong Kah)-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Before I begin, please allow me to declare my interests as a Board Director of MENDAKI, a beneficiary of the MBMF scheme that I will speak on in my speech.\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed changes&nbsp;will be one of the most significant for AMLA and I am confident that will bring about positive outcome as we aspire to strengthen the key pillars of&nbsp;the Malay/Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened to note that the community is generally supportive of the <p align=left>Column: 780</p>amendments, though there are&nbsp;concerns especially with regard&nbsp;to the widening of the scope of the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF), to which all Muslim workers contribute automatically.&nbsp; We must be mindful that through the MBMF, we operate on the goodwill of the community&nbsp;&ndash; especially in these difficult times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, it is necessary to have a greater public engagement to prevent misunderstanding of the intent and use of the MBMF.&nbsp; On a regular basis, we should also keep the public informed on how the community is progressing and benefiting from the programmes being funded by the MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MENDAKI, the Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOs) and the <I>madrasahs</I>, should engage the public more about the achievements especially in their goals to uplift the Malay community, particularly those from the bottom 30% of household income&nbsp;as well as in a broader scope, the strategic directions that they have planned to shape the Singapore Malay/Muslim community for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, we should not only ensure the support of the community but also the commitment of everyone so that we can achieve the intended outcome.&nbsp; All parties, ie, the administrators of the fund, donors, stakeholders and beneficiaries should play a part in achieving this outcome.&nbsp; I believe that this is not just about collective leadership or donorship, but also about collective responsibility of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the additional funding from the MBMF, the Ministry should also take the opportunity to consider more refreshing approaches to uplift, improve and renew the machinery that supports the community agenda.&nbsp; This may include encouraging renewal within the MMOs and mosques,&nbsp;establish new Malay/Muslim interest groups that can <p align=left>Column: 781</p>benefit the community and, perhaps, even broaden the scope to engage international expertise and organisations who can add value to our programmes, management and revenue-generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, there may be a number of interest groups consisting of professionals such as those in healthcare, arts, sports,&nbsp;new media, that have a keen interest to help the disadvantaged families in the community agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we should also address the expectations on the part of the MBMF donors: as donors,&nbsp;some may feel that they are&nbsp;entitled to scholarships and bursaries from MENDAKI&nbsp;&ndash; even for overseas tertiary education.&nbsp; I have come across cases where such expectations create friction between the community and what MENDAKI and the Malay leadership need to do&nbsp;for the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some young, successful Malay or Muslim Singaporeans grow up with a rift between them and the Malay establishment because of this expectation of the right towards free or subsidised education because of their parents' or personal contributions towards the MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, public engagement is critical for the community to come together and be clear on the MBMF's objectives and&nbsp;let the public be aware of results of the programmes that are being funded by the MBMF.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I would encourage greater transparency and reporting of the financial and KPI performances, especially with more of the community that are increasingly educated and wish to know that their monthly contributions are in good hands.&nbsp; Such reporting should not be just&nbsp;confined to the direct beneficiaries such as&nbsp;MUIS, MENDAKI and <I>madrasahs</I> under the JMS, but they should also include indirect beneficiaries such as the <p align=left>Column: 782</p>Malay/Muslim Organisations (MMOS) as well as&nbsp;other organisations benefiting from the '<I>amanah</I>' of the community.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

It is meant to strengthen our important institutions, the family, religion and mosques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are a number of concerns on the change to widen the use of the Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund. This is especially relating to the usage of the funds for <I>madrasah</I> education, and the channelling of more funds to MENDAKI in order to fund its programmes that help dysfunctional families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to prevent this lack of understanding from creating doubts on the good objectives of expanding MBMF&rsquo;s usage&nbsp;&ndash; that is, to fund better social and educational programmes for the long-term benefit of the community.&nbsp; So, in order to further convince the whole community, there is a need to ensure that the fund is managed and administered more carefully and transparently.&nbsp; In this regard, all parties play an essential part&nbsp;&ndash; the community, by giving their full support through their donations; and the beneficiaries, by showing commitment to ensure that the expected results are achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example is by setting KPIs, and not just financial audits, on the performance of the programmes under the Community Leaders' Forum (CLF). The same goes for <I>madrasah</I> education.&nbsp; The disbursement of funds, how it is used, the effects and the results, must all be <p align=left>Column: 783</p>presented. Ultimately, we want to see Malay/Muslim organisations and <I>madrasahs</I> that are more efficient and equipped to generate better programmes and education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the long term, we must see MBMF more than just a fund pool. It has existed for more than 40 years. Thus, what is the MBMF&rsquo;s direction for next 40 years? I feel that we have to work towards a system or method where our community is able to look after its own interests.&nbsp; For instance, other communities are giving support to religious and community infrastructure without a policy of community-based contributions and various methods of raising funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For other communities, we have heard how they contribute 10% of their income to their religious or welfare organisations.&nbsp; In the future we hope that our community will be able to work together, and be independent, without having to rely too much on a deduction system like MBMF.&nbsp; Maybe we will have more workers, entrepreneurs and community members who are more successful coming forward to lead the mosques and the Malay organisations more creatively without depending on Government grants or the MBMF.&nbsp; In this regard, it might be good if we give more space and flexibility to the mosques, for example, to generate their own funds in a more creative way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve these long-term aims, we must build a more effective future leadership and this effort must start now by using our current resources.&nbsp; This includes developing our youths today, who form a large percentage of the Malay/Muslim community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, Mr Deputy Speaker, I support this Amendment.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 875-876.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

While we acknowledge that the timing of this round of amendments is not perfect, I think there will never be a timing that is perfect. &nbsp;And taking the point that Mdm Halimah has raised,&nbsp;and if we delay it even further, the changes that we will&nbsp;make&nbsp;in the coming years&nbsp;will be even&nbsp;a lot more difficult to bear.&nbsp; It is during these trying times that the community can show true perseverance and courage in tackling our problems and addressing our needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad Magad has asked if the burden of the increase in MBMF contribution rates could be shifted from those in the second lowest income band to those in the highest income band.&nbsp; Sir, we had tried to strike a balance between the various income groups when computing the increase in contribution rates needed to fund the projects that we have in the pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current computation will already result in a 45% increase for the highest income group, and we felt that shifting more of the <p align=left>Column: 785</p>burden to them was not ideal as they are a very small group comprising only 8% of the MBMF contributors.&nbsp; And creating more income bands will not be administratively efficient as the number of Muslim employees earning $6,000 and above is even smaller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Principles of the MBMF</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to reiterate the underlying principles behind the MBMF.&nbsp; First, it only funds projects that are necessary and important.&nbsp; This is essential because the funds are limited, and we should get value and outcomes for our money.&nbsp; We are mindful that the bulk of the funds come from donations by ordinary Muslim workers.&nbsp; Second, the MBMF is based on a self-help principle.&nbsp; It is to enable the Malay/Muslim community in Singapore to raise funds to help itself, and enhance its position as a contributing pillar of the Singaporean society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, guided by these principles, we have set up the MBMF to fund mosque building when the need arose.&nbsp;&nbsp;We expanded the MBMF in 1984 to provide funding to Mendaki when there was a need for it. And now we are proposing to fund mosque upgrading and religious education because they are important priorities today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MBMF has been successful in addressing past needs.&nbsp; Now it needs to address current and future needs.&nbsp; The MBMF has been so successful that Mr Zaqy Mohamed has asked if the community has become over-dependent on it, impeding its culture of giving.&nbsp; I do not think so. &nbsp;All self-help groups in Singapore utilise the CPF check-off system to raise funds.&nbsp; The MBMF is not the community's sole source of funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite one example, the Tabung Amal Aidilfitri (TAA) raised over half a million dollars again this year, proving the generosity of the community.&nbsp; Many Malay/Muslim organisations successfully raise their own funds, and do not depend <p align=left>Column: 786</p>on the MBMF at all.&nbsp; In this case, we had turned to the MBMF only as a last resort.&nbsp; We had tried other avenues first, such as the Dana Madrasah and ad hoc fund-raising by mosque volunteers, but the mosque upgrading projects and programmes for religious education and dysfunctional families that we wish to fund require long-term planning and, more importantly, a stable source of funding, which only the MBMF can provide with certainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, let me assure Mr Zaqy and Mdm Halimah Yacob that there are proper procedures and controls in place to ensure the prudent use of the MBMF funds.&nbsp; As the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, I oversee the annual budget of the MBMF.&nbsp; The MBMF accounts are externally audited, and the progress and funding outcomes are closely monitored to ensure that they are well spent. &nbsp;I note Mdm Halimah's suggestion for greater sharing of the progress of programmes funded, also shared by Mr Zainul, and we will look into how this can be achieved.&nbsp; MUIS has distributed MBMF brochures to inform the public how much has been spent on building mosques, detailing the land cost and construction cost of each mosque.&nbsp;&nbsp;This information is also readily available on the MUIS website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will also continue to take advantage of existing platforms like the MUIS annual workplan seminar, and the Community Leaders' Forum to publicise the funded programmes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the mosque component of the MBMF, MUIS' decision to fund a mosque project is made with a holistic view, taking into account future projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;These projects have to be approved by the MUIS Council, and MUIS does not arbitrarily decide to fund projects simply because money is available.&nbsp; On the contrary, MUIS carefully plans the long-term usage of the fund, and has made projections until at least 2014, taking into account the rising construction costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount available annually is limited compared to the <p align=left>Column: 787</p>growing list of ageing mosques.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in contribution rates today will help to meet the shortfall for all projects in the pipeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zaqy's suggestion for mosques to diversify their funding sources is noted. &nbsp;This is something we will review subject to the guidelines for best practices, such as those in the Charity Council's Code of Governance, where appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Mendaki component of the MBMF, a portion of it is used to provide fee subsidies and, in some cases, complete waivers, for educational programmes such as the MENDAKI Tuition Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remainder is set aside for social and community projects by Malay/Muslim organisations, or MMOs. MMOs submit proposals for funding which are approved under the Malay/Muslim Community Development Fund, or in short, the MMCDF. &nbsp;This&nbsp;Committee is chaired by one of Mendaki's Board of Directors.&nbsp; These proposals must clearly demonstrate alignment to the challenges faced by the community, and indicate clear targets, outreach and timelines.&nbsp; Once funding is approved, the MMO has to submit timely reports, and their programme will be subjected to annual reviews to ensure that it is effective and meet the targets set.&nbsp; All these are closely monitored by Mendaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of MMOs meet their targets, and some even exceed their targets.&nbsp; Mendaki, Sir, will work with the MMOs that are unable to meet their targets to improve their performance and processes.&nbsp; A copy of the MMCDF report is submitted to the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah felt that the increasing sentiment is that mosques have gone beyond the basics. I do not think I can agree with her on this. &nbsp;Indeed, mosques have taken on more roles and functions, such as social development programmes.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 788</p>They no longer simply provide a place for worship.&nbsp; If they did so, it would be a disservice to the community that such physical assets are utilised only for prayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ahmad mentioned that he had read reports of mosques with fancy chandeliers and expensive carpets.&nbsp; These were given by sponsors who insisted on donating them as they had already purchased the items, despite our advice to them not to do so.&nbsp; In these cases, mosques eventually accepted the items because not doing so would be a waste.&nbsp; Let me assure Dr Ahmad that extra care has been taken for all project spending to ensure that there is no cost overrun.&nbsp; In some cases, MUIS had even managed to achieve some savings.&nbsp; MUIS will continue to work with the mosques to identify areas for cost savings.&nbsp; For example, MUIS has also worked closely with consultants to review and propose alternative designs and install building components acquired at lower cost, reducing the overall cost of the projects. A total of $2.3 million was saved due to their cut-back efforts in five recent mosque projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will exercise greater prudence during these troubling times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me elaborate on the four key principles of the usage of the mosque component of the MBMF. First and foremost is to provide for the basic essentials of the mosque, such as prayer halls, barrier-free features and ancillary facilities for mosques to be family-friendly, youth-friendly and community-friendly. Second, to provide more prayer space for mosques with growing congregations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, to provide space in mosques to house Islamic learning and social development programmes, such as the aLIVE programme for teenagers.&nbsp; As a socio-religious institution, mosques with better facilities have effectively impacted the targeted segment of the Muslim community with programmes for challenged youths, low-income families <p align=left>Column: 789</p>and initiated many social capital projects with the community at large.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to address the wear and tear of the mosques, as you can see, the MBMF funds will be spent only on necessary items.&nbsp; We will follow norms that are basic, but of good quality.&nbsp; MUIS will keep a close watch to ensure that the materials used and structures built are modest but long-lasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;mosques are selected for upgrading based on the urgency of their needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, MBMF mosques requiring major works and non-MBMF mosques that have not undergone major upgrading since 1990 will be given priority.&nbsp; Earlier, I had described the needs of Al-Ansar mosque, which I had visited recently.&nbsp; Al-Ansar is among the first few mosques slated for upgrading due to its urgent roof leakage problem and the need to optimise its built-in space. &nbsp;Additionally, there are also mosques that have already collected the bulk of what they need for upgrading, or need to undertake smaller urgent works.&nbsp;&nbsp;In such cases, the MBMF may be used to top up a small portion of what is needed so as to enable these mosques to be upgraded.&nbsp; I understand that An Nur mosque is one such example.&nbsp; Given the limited funds available annually, MUIS will have to carefully prioritise the use of MBMF to co-fund any project and will develop a five-year plan for mosque upgrading works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To&nbsp;Mr Hawazi's query as to whether there will be&nbsp;a new mosque to be built in the Woodlands estate, these are issues in which we have to study carefully over the longer term as there are other areas that are also in demand for the second mosque.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Madrasahs</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the topic of <I>madrasahs</I>, Mr Masago Zulkifli has raised a number of good suggestions.&nbsp; He noted that the current <I>madrasah</I> fee structure does not differentiate between those who have the <p align=left>Column: 790</p>potential to be religious leaders versus those who simply want an alternative education system. &nbsp;He suggested that greater funding be allocated to&nbsp;students with the potential to be religious leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;The three <I>madrasahs</I> under the Joint Madrasah System, or JMS, will be doing this.&nbsp; The JMS will offer different pathways with different cost models.&nbsp; Pathways leading to specialised religious qualifications will receive higher subsidies compared to pathways more similar to the curriculum in national schools.&nbsp; This is the key principle behind the decision to channel MBMF funds to the full-time <I>madrasahs&nbsp;&ndash;</I> that the community supports those who have the potential to be religious teachers and leaders while parents have to bear a greater cost burden for the other <I>madrasah</I> students.&nbsp; The three <I>madrasahs</I> not under the JMS can also consider a fee structure that differentiates between the two groups of students.&nbsp; In addition, MUIS has put in place the Madrasah Scholars Programme to provide supplemental development programmes for top <I>madrasah</I> students.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Masagos also suggested allowing capable national primary school students to transit easily into <I>madrasahs</I> at the secondary school level. The current system is already flexible enough to allow them to do so, subject of course to certain entry requirements.&nbsp; The Primary One level is not the only entry level. For example, Ustaz Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, Head of the Office of the Mufti in MUIS entered Madrasah Aljunied only after completing his \"O\" levels.&nbsp; In principle, we are committed to ensuring that each and every child receives the opportunity to maximise his or her potential, be it religious or secular, and we have provided many different options for them to do so.&nbsp; We will look into how we can smoothen the transition for students with all our stakeholders and MOE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Magad asked how the <I>madrasahs</I> intend to spend the MBMF <p align=left>Column: 791</p>funds.&nbsp; The changes to the MBMF will raise about $2.9 million a year for religious education.&nbsp; Most of this will go towards grants for full-time <I>madrasahs</I>, and the remainder will be split between Islamic learning in part-time <I>madrasahs</I> and <I>asatizah</I> development.&nbsp; The use of Information Technology in classrooms will be expanded.&nbsp; <I>Madrasahs</I> will study the latest strategies in the teaching of English, Mathematics and Science in national schools.&nbsp; <I>Madrasah</I> teachers will have their skills upgraded and will be introduced to new teaching methods.&nbsp; The progress of these initiatives will be tracked by indicators such as examination scores and reviewed regularly by MUIS.&nbsp; These enhancements will move our current <I>madrasah</I> system up several notches, to be closer to the standards seen in our national school system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <I>madrasahs</I> are already very prudent with their spending.&nbsp; I saw this when I recently visited Madrasah Aljunied.&nbsp; For example, the average salary for their teachers is below $2,000 a month. MBMF funding for <I>madrasahs</I> will reduce their fundraising burden so that they can concentrate on providing the best education for their students.&nbsp; In the spirit of transparency advocated by Mr Zaqy, MUIS will make the financial statements of the JMS <I>madrasahs</I> public after the end of each financial year. I encourage the other three <I>madrasahs</I> not under the JMS to follow suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I trust that the community will be able to appreciate and take ownership of our <I>madrasahs</I> as key religious institutions that will shape the spiritual life of the community.&nbsp; Given the small size of our community, I hope that the community will not be fragmented in its approach by choosing to fund only certain items with its MBMF contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me end the discussion on the MBMF by thanking Members and the <p align=left>Column: 792</p>Malay/Muslim community for their support for the MBMF.&nbsp; I know this because over 20,000 Muslims, or 10.5% of the total contributor base, have gone the extra distance to indicate that they wish to contribute more than the minimum rate, and the additional sum contributed by them amounts to over $77,000 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will continue to publicise the good work of the MBMF, so that the community, especially the young, will maintain its ownership of the MBMF.&nbsp; Last year, MUIS launched a book to celebrate the first 30 years of the MBMF.&nbsp; We will look into how we can make the information more widely available, by leveraging on our mosques, our events, new media, and the internet to recognise the MBMF on projects that it funds.&nbsp; MUIS will also be working with CPF Board to inform employers of the changes to the MBMF via the CPF mailers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the MBMF has, and will continue, to stay relevant with the times.&nbsp; Mr Zainul and Mr Zaqy have raised good suggestions on the future use of the MBMF.&nbsp; The intention has always been to direct the MBMF's limited funds to where they are needed the most.&nbsp; After 33 years of MBMF, we are now expanding its use for mosque upgrading and religious education and we do so only because these are important needs of our community.&nbsp; Mr Zaqy suggested that maybe we can use these funds to upgrade Malay/Muslim organisations.&nbsp; I do not think MMOs need such support as there are ample national resources available for purposes such as piloting new initiatives and capability-building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will adhere to this principle to ensure that our community's resources remain sustainable in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Raising the minimum marriage age</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now address the Members' concerns about the proposal to raise the <p align=left>Column: 793</p>minimum Muslim marriage age.&nbsp; But, first, I would like to reiterate the principles behind this proposal.&nbsp; We have advocated it to send a strong signal to the community that minor marriages are discouraged.&nbsp; It is not intended to cure all problems relating to teenage sexuality, nor is it intended to replace the existing efforts to tackle the problem.&nbsp; It will be complemented by targeted public education, both in and out of schools, to inculcate awareness and the right mindset in Muslim youth, as Dr Fatimah Lateef has advised.&nbsp; And it will be supported by religious education programmes to imbue the right values in our youth.&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin suggested raising the minimum Muslim marriage age to 21.&nbsp; I understand his suggestion and the principle is that we should do so because by the age of 21 or above, most couples would be ready and would&nbsp;have sufficient funding and jobs.&nbsp; However, Sir, this law&nbsp;is more restrictive than the current rules for non-Muslim marriages under the Women's Charter, and our proposed amendment today is to make the rules aligned with non-Muslim marriages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the proposal will not be a restriction of Muslim rights as underage couples can still get married with a special marriage licence from the Kadi.&nbsp; In fact, the proposal to raise the minimum marriage age from 16 to 18 will only affect a very small group.&nbsp; In 2006, 87 individuals aged 16 and 17 got married.&nbsp; In 2007, the corresponding number was 76.&nbsp; Over the past five years, we have not received a single marriage application from Muslims below 16 years old.&nbsp; I hope this trend will continue even after we raise the minimum marriage age.&nbsp; For non-Muslims, 125 applications for underage marriages for those below 18 have been approved in the past&nbsp;five years.&nbsp; These marriages were allowed after the couple's psychological and emotional readiness for marriage had been assessed by a psychologist.&nbsp; Generally, Sir, the Kadi will adopt a similar approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 794</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad highlighted that minor divorces were not the only undesirable outcome of the teenage sexuality problem, and that the Muslim community views abortion and single parenthood as equally undesirable.&nbsp; While our primary focus has always been to tackle teenage sexuality as it is the root cause, we must not forget about those who have made mistakes, and we must help them reshape their lives and this is why we have social support programmes for unwed mothers.&nbsp; The Pertapis Centre for Women and Girls provides counselling, back-to-school programmes and life skills programmes for them.&nbsp; Mendaki also has skills upgrading programmes for single mothers who can then find employment through Mendaki's subsidiary, Mendaki Sense.&nbsp; The sheltered home at the Pertapis Centre is not operating at maximum capacity and, if needed, we will find the resources to increase its capacity. Casa Raudha may also admit single mothers on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; I do not expect that we would have to come to this, as I believe that family support in the Muslim community remains very strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to note that Dr Maliki Osman has given his support for the proposed amendments to make it easier for divorced Muslim women to file claims against their ex-husbands.&nbsp; However, he asked what can be done to educate these men of their responsibilities to their former wives and children.&nbsp; He also suggested that the community should send a strong message to these men that they should not take these responsibilities lightly. I agree with the spirit of Dr Maliki's comments, and MCYS will work closely with the Adam Association, a Malay organisation, on the public education, such as a hotline. For his suggestion to create some form of assessment for divorced men before they can remarry, we will have to study this further. There may be issues if we deny a man his right to marry just so that we can solve the issue of maintenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 795</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki&nbsp;also suggested for us to channel MBMF funds to fund those who are interested&nbsp;to take up social work as a career. This is a good idea but again we should not expand the use of MBMF fund so readily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Internationalisation of MUIS</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I thank Mr Hawazi for applauding the move to internationalise MUIS services.&nbsp;Let me just address two last points before wrapping up my speech.&nbsp; To answer&nbsp;Dr Fatimah's query, yes, there are currently four women on the MUIS team that will be tasked to handle the internationalisation of its services. I am not sure whether it will make a difference but they are there.&nbsp; We will ensure that female representation continues, and that Muslim women's issues will not be neglected.&nbsp; Our other proposals today to improve the welfare of divorced Muslim women is an example of the strong commitment we have to our Muslim women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;Mr Hawazi Daipi has made further suggestions to improve the processes of the Syariah Court.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform him that they are already in place, such as the six-month deadline for the delivery of Syariah Court judgments to MUIS for appeal cases, and ensuring that the Syariah Court adjudicators are legally trained.&nbsp; The compensation packages of Syariah Court judges and officers are pegged to the civil service pay scale for graduates, and the Syariah Court does not have a problem recruiting young graduates today.&nbsp; MUIS has been working with the Singapore Law Academy to provide the Academy with judgments of the Appeal Board.&nbsp; Some of the Appeal Board's landmark judgments are available on the Lawnet website, and MUIS and the Syariah Court can look into how to develop this further.&nbsp; The Syariah Court, Sir,&nbsp;monitors its workload on an ongoing <p align=left>Column: 796</p>basis, and has measures in place to cope with fluctuations, such as tapping on <I>ad hoc</I> judges and mediators, and embracing technology such as a self-help payment kiosk.&nbsp; These measures have helped to improve the efficiency and quality of the Court's services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am heartened to note that Members agree with the principles and objectives of the proposed amendments.&nbsp; The same sentiment was expressed by the various stakeholders and community leaders whom I have met in my rounds of engagement&nbsp;with them.&nbsp; Of course they have also raised some concerns.&nbsp; I would like to assure them that I take these views seriously. I have asked the relevant agencies&nbsp;such as&nbsp;MUIS and Mendaki to address these concerns.&nbsp; Having said that, Sir, I am confident that the Malay/Muslim community will agree with me that the proposed amendments will strengthen our efforts to help ourselves and in the process address future challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end, Sir,&nbsp;with a short speech in Malay with the forbearance of the Whip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Malay</I> ):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2008/20081117/20081117VS_125401.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a>*.</I>]&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, allow me to begin my speech in Malay by putting on record my deepest appreciation to the Malay/Muslim community for their encouragement and support in proposing these amendments to the AMLA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed amendments came as a result of close cooperation between agencies such as the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS), the Registry of Muslim Marriages (ROMM), the Syariah Court and the Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp; For example, the idea to improve the registration procedure to ease Muslim women's claims towards their ex-husbands was proposed by Malay/Muslim lawyers from the Muslim Law Practice Committee.&nbsp; I also want to mention the important role played by the <p align=left>Column: 797</p>Malay/Muslim leaders and mosques' representatives who have given various feedback and ideas which are not only good but also very valuable, during the dialogue sessions with me.&nbsp; I would also like to put on record my thanks and appreciation for their support and wisdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, the Malay/Muslim community has never run away from the challenge to overcome the issues that were facing them.&nbsp; We have, and will continue, to work together to address the problems of drug abuse and many other problems.&nbsp; We will continue these efforts to further improve our own achievements and, if possible, introduce and launch more initiatives that are bold and innovative to overcome existing and future problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A similar initiative is the readiness of the Malay/Muslim community to be included in the Human Organ Transplant Act (HOTA) in August this year.&nbsp; As we know, the first donation involving a Muslim under HOTA was carried out last month.&nbsp; This transplant was carried out successfully within less than 24 hours and received the support of the family.&nbsp; Our readiness to sacrifice and not just think about ourselves put our community in a good position to face various challenges in the future. And in line with this spirit, we have decided to amend AMLA this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments here aim to strengthen families and the Malay/Muslim institutions.&nbsp; We hope that with stronger families, the community can reduce the high rate of divorces among our young couples. Stronger Muslim institutions will be beneficial to the Muslim community and protect our interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, we now can see for ourselves the results of our hard work in overcoming the various social problems and challenges, and improving the socio-economic status of our community.&nbsp; Our <p align=left>Column: 798</p>students continue to show good performance in schools and institutions of higher learning, and the rates of school dropouts are reducing. All these could not have been achieved without the solid support and full involvement of each member of the Malay/Muslim community.&nbsp; The proposed amendments to AMLA are a progressive and timely step taken by the community.&nbsp; The amendments will put our community in a good position to face a future that is shaped by an increasingly challenging environment.&nbsp; The proposed amendments will give our community the strength and additional resources that provide the opportunity for our children to climb even further.&nbsp; I am sure that we will see the results one day. Finally, I hope that the Malay/Muslim community will support this noble effort to enable us to stand proud alongside our fellow countrymen.</p>\r\n</span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 877-880.<BR></div></P></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Clarification, Sir.&nbsp; My reference to mosques going beyond the basics is not in relation to the functions of the mosques but in relation to the&nbsp;upgrading works in the mosques.&nbsp; Now that the MBMF will be extended to cover upgrading&nbsp;of the mosques,&nbsp;there must be a mechanism to ensure prudent use of funds for upgrading purposes.\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" /> \r\n \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\r\n\t\r\n  \t<HEAD>\r\n\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\r\n  \t</HEAD> \r\n  \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">\r\n\r\n\r\n      \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n      \t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t </span></div> \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill collates a number of amendments to several Acts which are mainly technical in nature. &nbsp;Let me highlight the key ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments to the Copyright Act (Clause 6)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clause 6 amends section 107B and section 261D(2) of the Copyright Act.&nbsp; Currently, a radio station is exempted from paying record companies when it plays their songs on the radio via a digital transmission that is not a subscription and interactive service.&nbsp; This is because the radio station helps record companies popularise their songs and boost their CD sales. &nbsp;However, this symbiotic relationship is less applicable when a radio station plays the songs, say&nbsp;over the Internet, since it is easier for listeners to make high quality copies of the songs.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;will reduce their need to buy CDs.&nbsp; Hence, in order not to unduly prejudice the interests of record companies, clause 6 amends section 107B of the Copyright Act to clarify that the exemption will only apply to over-the-air digital audio transmission that is not a subscription and interactive service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 800</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6 also amends section 261D(2) of the Copyright Act.&nbsp; In exercising their copyright, owners of music, software and other copyrighted works may control the access to their works by using technology that limit,&nbsp;say, the number of times the works can be accessed, or the people who can access them.&nbsp; The Copyright Act prohibits the unauthorised circumvention of such technology. &nbsp;However, as such a prohibition may prevent legitimate and non-infringing use of certain types of works, section 261D(2) of the Copyright Act provides for certain works to be exempted from the prohibition. &nbsp;Currently, the works to be exempted can only be specified by type. &nbsp;Clause 6 amends section 261(D)(2) to also allow the exemption to be specified, where appropriate, by the purpose for which the circumvention is done and the persons who may carry out the circumvention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendment to the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act (Clause 11)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, another Act that is amended is the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act.&nbsp; Clause 11 repeals section 33 of the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act, substituting it with a new section that is more closely aligned with section 6 of the Terrorism (Suppression of Bombings) Act 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The intent of the new section 33 is to give full effect to Article 11 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism (the \"Convention\") which deems Convention offences&nbsp;&ndash; in our case, they include all terrorism financing offences as defined in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act&nbsp;&ndash; to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between State Parties to the Convention before the entry into force of the Convention for those Parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has extradition treaties with the US, Germany and the Hong Kong <p align=left>Column: 801</p>Special Administrative Region, which predate our ratification of the Convention.&nbsp; Singapore, the US, Germany and Hong Kong are all Parties to the Convention.&nbsp; To ensure that terrorism financing offences are covered as extraditable offences under the relevant extradition treaty between Singapore and these&nbsp;three countries so that accused or convicted persons may be extradited from Singapore to these countries in appropriate cases, clause 11 inserts new sub-sections (5) and (6) into section 33 of the Act to make it clear that the Extradition Act may be applied in relation to the US, Germany or Hong Kong under section 4 of the Extradition Act,&nbsp;as if the relevant extradition treaty provided for the extradition of persons accused of or convicted of an offence against that country's laws which would&nbsp;&ndash; if it had taken place in Singapore&nbsp;&ndash; have constituted a terrorism financing offence as defined in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards a Convention country with which Singapore has no extradition treaty, there is no change in position as sub-section (2) of new section 33 is not new.&nbsp; This sub-section gives Singapore the option of extraditing to a Convention State with whom no extradition treaty is in force.&nbsp; A person accused or convicted of a foreign offence, which, if it had taken place in Singapore, would have constituted a terrorism financing offence as defined in the Terrorism (Suppression of Financing) Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments to the Building Control Act (Clause 4)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 4 amends the Building Control Act.&nbsp; The Building Control Act provides for the licensing of two classes of builders&nbsp;&ndash; Class 1 Licensed Builders who can tender for construction projects of any amount, and Class 2 Licensed Builders who can tender for projects of up to $3 million. &nbsp;In view of rising <p align=left>Column: 802</p>construction costs, the amendment in clause 4 is to give the Minister flexibility in varying the contract values of Class 2 Licensed Builders.&nbsp; In a similar vein, clause 4 introduces an amendment to allow the Minister to vary the minimum cut-off contract value for \"significant general building work projects\" so as to cater to the volatile prices of construction materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 4 also amends the Building Control Act to allow different sets of qualifications and practical experience to be prescribed for the management and the technical staff of a \"Licensed Building\". Currently, the Building Control Act allows only one set of qualification and practical experience to be prescribed for both the management and technical staff.&nbsp; This is not ideal as different abilities are required for the management of the business and the supervision of building works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Amendments to the Casino Control Act (Clause 5)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next set of amendments contained in clause 5 relates to the Casino Control Act.&nbsp; We are amending the language and minor details to improve the interpretation and administration of the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the Casino Regulatory Authority can request the Police to provide information regarding applicants for casino licences for the purposes of suitability checks.&nbsp; Clause 5 amends the Act to extend this to cover their associates and special employees.&nbsp; This regularises the various suitability checks that the Authority may conduct on different persons regulated under the Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 5 also clarifies that in the event of an appeal to the Casino Regulatory Authority arising from a dispute between patrons and casino operators, written or <p align=left>Column: 803</p>other means of appeals are permitted in addition to face-to-face hearings.&nbsp; Foreign tourists on short visits can thus continue their dispute process with casino operators even after leaving the country.&nbsp; The appeals committee can still call parties to appear before them, should they deem it&nbsp;necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another clarification is to enable the Casino Regulatory Authority to take a combination of disciplinary actions against a \"special employee\" instead of just one type of disciplinary action.&nbsp; The amendment will ensure consistency in the approach taken by the Authority against \"special employees\" and \"casino operators\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, clause 5 reduces the record keeping period applicable to a casino operator from&nbsp;seven to&nbsp;five years to render it consistent with what is now applicable to companies under the March 2007 amendment to section 199 of the Companies Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments to the Land Surveyors Act (Clause 8)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 8 amends the Land Surveyors Act to tighten the penalty against errant registered surveyors by allowing the Board to impose a combination of the existing three disciplinary actions against a registered surveyor instead of just one of the actions.&nbsp; The existing three disciplinary actions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) The imposition of a penalty not exceeding $10,000;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) A written censure of the registered surveyor under the hand of the President; and<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp;Ordering the registered surveyor to pay costs of any correction to his <p align=left>Column: 804</p>cadastral survey incurred by the Chief Surveyor.<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This amendment will give the Board more flexibility in dealing with errant registered surveyors. &nbsp;The ability to mete out stiffer penalties will also enable the Board to play a more effective role in ensuring that the high standards of the profession are upheld.&nbsp; The amendment will also align the disciplinary actions under the Land Surveyors Act&nbsp;with the Professional Engineers Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments to the Prisons Act (Clause 9)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 9 amends the Prisons Act to empower the Minister for Home Affairs to make Regulations for the good management and government of Prisons and Reformative Training Centres.&nbsp; The Minister has exercised this power to establish advisory committees to provide independent input on various matters.&nbsp; For example, the Employment Release Selection Committee was set up to recommend to the Director of Prisons the suitability of an inmate to be released beyond the precincts of the prison for employment.&nbsp; The Home Detention Advisory Committee was set up to advise the Director of Prisons on the suitability of inmates for Home Detention as referred to the Committee by the Superintendent.&nbsp; These committees are part of a framework of the checks and balances to help ensure the good management and administration of prison institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Home Detention Scheme was introduced in 2000, the Prisons Act was amended to expressly empower the Minister to make regulations on the establishment of Home Detention Advisory Committees, its functions and procedures.&nbsp; For clarification of doubt, clause 9 will amend the Prisons Act to expressly authorise the Minister to also make Regulations to establish advisory committees in general.</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 805</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\n<I>Miscellaneous Amendments</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, a few amendments are proposed to facilitate better administration of various Acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments due to deletion and substitution of a section in Health Sciences Authority Act (Clauses 2 and 7)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clauses 2 and 7 make technical amendments to ensure that the definition of \"chemical metrology\" is properly included into the Health Sciences Authority Act.&nbsp; This was originally intended to be inserted after the definition of \"cosmetic\" in the Health Sciences Act by the A*STAR (Amendment) Act 2007. However, just before the A*STAR (Amendment) Act came into force, the definition of \"cosmetic\" was removed in the Health Sciences Authority Act by another Act.&nbsp; Hence, the definition of \"chemical metrology\" can be inserted only now into the&nbsp;Health Sciences Authority Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendment to Boundaries and Survey Maps Act (Clause 3)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, clause 3 amends the definition of \"land\" in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act is to make it consistent with the definition of \"land\" in the Land Titles Act.&nbsp; The definition of \"land\" in the Land Titles Act was amended in August 2001 to include any parcel of airspace or any subterranean space, whether or not, held apart from the surface of the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><I>Amendments to the Land (Titles) Strata Act (Clause 9)</I></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, clause 9 makes some \"house keeping\" amendments to the Land Titles (Strata) Act, namely, to delete unnecessary cross-references, correct minor slips like incorrect references to a corresponding legislation or section number and to make the correct reference to an <p align=left>Column: 806</p>\"approved liquidator\" consistent with the definition in the Companies Act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc.

I studied their cross cultural <p align=left>Column: 807</p>patterns of ageing&nbsp;&ndash; were there similarities and differences between the way a Chinese elderly person ages as compared to his or her Malay and&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;counterparts? The research led me to understand the psychological, physical, emotional, social and spiritual changes that occur in the ageing process, the caregiving load carried by family members as well as the impact of an ageing population on the society&nbsp;at&nbsp;large.&nbsp; I also asked my respondents for suggestions&nbsp;on policies and services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, what I said today is a culmination of&nbsp;19 years of reflection and&nbsp;analysis of the views of the end-users of our eldercare and family-oriented services drawing from several research projects.&nbsp; Since older people are frequent users of our healthcare services, ie, polyclinics, hospitals and home-based care, I would touch not only on the social services but the health aspects as well.&nbsp; Given the time constraint, I will only briefly speak on the importance of family caregiver policies.&nbsp; I hope that my input will have some relevance and bearing&nbsp;upon the preparation of next year's Budget as well as the next ElderCare Masterplan by MCYS which will be forthcoming after 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that the speed at which Singapore's population is ageing.&nbsp; It is one of the fastest in the world.&nbsp; What took other developed countries 150 years to evolve, we will shoot through within about 20 years.&nbsp; Currently, people above 65 years form about 9% of our population but they will reach 20% by the year 2030.&nbsp;They will be assets as well as liabilities on the economy.&nbsp; The recent episode of DBS High Notes 5 and&nbsp;Minibonds have highlighted dramatically the retirees' need for financial literacy and how they are easily influenced. At the same time, the Singapore public realised <p align=left>Column: 808</p>the political and social ramifications of such incidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is our population ageing at full speed but the aged, ie,&nbsp;those above 80 years, are also increasing in greater numbers.&nbsp; The elongated life expectancy of the population is unprecedented!&nbsp; At birth, a woman born in 2006 can expect to live to 82 years and a man till 78 years. What are the major implications of longer average lifespans?&nbsp; While it can be seen as the success of mankind in keeping the human species alive, it is also a drain on family, community and state resources, health services in particular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us take stock at this point, and examine what we have&nbsp;done so far and where&nbsp;we are going in the future.&nbsp; What are the achievements and what are the shortcomings in our efforts to prepare our nation for the full onslaught of a greying population?&nbsp; We have included ageing policies in our national agenda, and we have given some priority to this issue. More than two ElderCare Masterplans have been drawn up, and&nbsp;more than six national surveys conducted by various Ministries on the older population in the last two decades.&nbsp; Relevant changes have been made to the various legislation.&nbsp; Many changes have been introduced to the CPF, eg,&nbsp;ElderShield insurance scheme, and more to come, such as CPF LIFE Annuity.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;light of these structural changes in the political economy of our country, what is the trickle down effect on the ground?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics show that although suicides among seniors have dropped at the turn of the century, they are on the rise again (<I>Straits Times'</I> article, 6th September 2008).&nbsp;In 2007, the rate was 27.6% per 100,000 population.&nbsp; In terms of numbers, 87 elders killed themselves, the majority being males.&nbsp; The risk of suicides among people above 80 is explained by loneliness, medical problems and physical disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 809</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at another social indicator&nbsp;&ndash; crime against older people.&nbsp; Robberies and snatch thefts targeting&nbsp;those aged 60 and above&nbsp;jumped up 25% according to the January-June statistics to hit 145 cases this year.&nbsp; The statistics for the same period last year was 116.&nbsp; Why are elders being targeted by criminals in a country that supposedly respects its elders? Is it to do with changing mindsets of the public? Or is it related to the economic downturn and inflation? Or is it that vulnerable people will be targeted for crime, given an opportunity?&nbsp; And therefore we will have to step up neighbourly vigilance and educate our elders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third social indicator is the rising numbers of elders dying alone, and no one coming forward to claim their bodies.&nbsp; According to a report in the <I>Straits Times</I>, titled \"Dying Alone\" in 2007, 45 persons' bodies were unclaimed despite police appeals. This is a rise above the 2006 number of 41 and the 2005 number of 32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This topic reminds me of an Indian elderly man I had interviewed for my Doctoral thesis.&nbsp; He was very poor and on Public Assistance. When I asked him if he would like to return to India, he said he preferred to stay in Singapore.&nbsp; I quote his words, \"The Government is like my father.&nbsp; If I die alone, I know the Government will take care of my body and will give me a proper funeral.\"&nbsp; These words representing the sentiments of the older generation of elders have much significance.&nbsp; The amount of faith that that generated had and still has, leads one to look at whether the Government is&nbsp;living up to their expectations.&nbsp;With the gloomy economic scenario that we are facing&nbsp;in the near future, will the elderly poor be&nbsp;able to manage with their meager Public Assistance of $330 a month?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The aim of discussing these social indicators and the message they convey <p align=left>Column: 810</p>to the public at large, including policy-makers, is that while the country is getting more and more affluent, our social fabric is getting less cohesive and the elderly in the middle and lower-income classes are being marginalised.&nbsp;&nbsp;When an economic downturn occurs, they are the first to be retrenched.&nbsp; When inflation hits, they feel the pinch more because their income has&nbsp;dwindled, and when their children go away overseas, many are left to fend on their own. These are not the minority as figures of Singaporeans migrating overseas are getting substantial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I now move on to shortcoming or gaps in policies, after which I will discuss the gaps and services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to highlight four gaps in policies.&nbsp; But before I move on, I wish to mention that the appointment of Mr Lim Boon Heng as Minister-in-charge of Ageing Population at the&nbsp;PMO's Office&nbsp;last year was a very important step.&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Ministerial Committee on Ageing, which Mr Lim chairs, signals the Government's recognition&nbsp;that&nbsp;a coordinated approach is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first&nbsp;policy&nbsp;I want to address is a National Registry of Elders living alone or living as a couple.&nbsp; This has been mentioned in the past but, to my knowledge, it is still not a reality.&nbsp; In the study of four countries by Prof.&nbsp;Hermalin&nbsp;of University of Michigan, those considered vulnerable in Singapore are elders living alone, childless, poor, above 70 years, and those who are frail.&nbsp; Women tend to be a substantial proportion of this group;&nbsp; hence, this term \"feminisation of poverty\".&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need a Registry of vulnerable older people that includes referrals from the Ministry of Health, MCYS as well as community-based agencies such as CDCs, Resident Committees and FSCs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Targeted <p align=left>Column: 811</p>help such as financial assistance, health screening, help-in-kind such as transport and meal vouchers, could be efficiently rendered to these Singaporeans who have sacrificed their lives to help build our nation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second policy&nbsp;&ndash; the formulas of means testing are currently inconsistent between MCYS and MOH.&nbsp; MCYS sets two tiers, ie,&nbsp; 50% and 75%, while MOH has three tiers, ie, 25%, 50% and&nbsp;75%.&nbsp; For example, someone who is eligible and receives financial assistance at&nbsp;a Day Rehabilitation Centre, when he is&nbsp;moved to the Social Day Care Centre, he may suddenly find that he has no more financial aid. It is strongly recommended that the means testing formulas between these two Ministries be streamlined so that the schemes are more user-friendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third policy&nbsp;&ndash; the current Many Helping Hands approach has served us well for the past few decades but it has its shortcomings. One of the main limitations is that the delivery of services is fragmented, piecemeal and not easy to&nbsp;navigate&nbsp;by end-users. There are many hotlines, such as ComCare hotline, to help alleviate the situation to some extent.&nbsp; However, there is an urgent need to standardise and centralise the services so that the public can use them without experiencing the 'passing the parcel' syndrome. In 1989, the Report of the Advisory Council of the Aged recommended that&nbsp;a National Council on&nbsp;Ageing be&nbsp;established to co-ordinate policies&nbsp;and services for the older population.&nbsp; However, this recommendation was not taken but&nbsp;the National Council for Family and the Aged (NACFA) was set up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent 2004 study which was commissioned by MCYS to the Gerontological Society of Singapore, titled \"The State of Gerontology in Singapore\" <p align=left>Column: 812</p>(in which I was involved as a co-Chair), we consulted international experts, Singaporean professionals and reviewed the agendas and approaches of six countries towards tackling the challenges of an ageing population.&nbsp; These countries were UK, USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, and&nbsp;India.&nbsp; One of the key findings was that we lack a national level, cutting-edge Institute or&nbsp;Centre on Gerontology.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Council for the Third Age (C3A) was set up last year, I thought that it may fulfil the functions of such a National&nbsp;Centre.&nbsp; However, looking at their vision,&nbsp;mission and focus on Active Ageing agenda, I feel that it does not have the iconic focus unless it expands its role in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution to the multi-faceted and complex challenges ahead is, in my view, a National Council or Institute which will maximise our&nbsp;resources and avoid duplication.&nbsp; We should look at this, in a sense that policy practice and research&nbsp;need to be combined as a major approach in Singapore.&nbsp; It would not only serve to address the issues of fragmentation, but also be&nbsp;a Regional Institute representing South East Asia on the world map.&nbsp; It could be set up by joint funding from MOH, MCYS, MOM and even MTI, for the entrepreneurial activities of the baby boomer&nbsp;generation of the future would possibly be&nbsp;of interest&nbsp;to MTI!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last topic under policies is on family caregivers.&nbsp; We lack a holistic and integrated approach that includes mandatory family leave, informational resources and incentives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I move on to the gaps in services.&nbsp; The first gap is in relation to our community-based care.&nbsp; We have to work towards a system of chronic care that is integrated and comprehensive&nbsp;&ndash; medical, personal, social and rehabilitative aspects. In a recent study&nbsp;of Perceptions of Primary Healthcare by older persons in <p align=left>Column: 813</p>Singapore by&nbsp;Tsao Foundation, it was found that many older people in Singapore dread falling sick.&nbsp; They say&nbsp;\"falling sick is worse than death in the Singapore context\".&nbsp;The spiralling medical costs, long waiting hours in polyclinics, lack of proper explanation or guidance by the doctors who are rushing against time (like me!), and the inconvenience of seeing a&nbsp;different doctor at&nbsp;every visit&nbsp;&ndash; all these make the visit to the polyclinic stressful and frustrating.&nbsp; Caregivers also voiced their need for support from the State.&nbsp; So the first gap is in relation to home health and home help services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the social services for older people, the VWOs play a major role.&nbsp; The demand for home help services which include personal hygiene, home management such as laundry and housekeeping, escort for medical appointments, meals delivery and&nbsp;befriending has increased.&nbsp; In a report&nbsp;titled \"Wither Home Health Care?\" in the <I>Straits Times</I>, the demand for such services was noted to have risen from 1,300 in the year 2002 to 1,900 this year.&nbsp; Social and health services are required by frail elders who live alone or they</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n       \r\n   <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->\r\n   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>live with family members who are working and therefore unavailable in the day time, or those whose spouses are also handicapped and sick.&nbsp; VWOs have many problems in continuing to deliver these much needed services due to funding and manpower constraints.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to one provider, the funding formula by MCYS and NCSS is not keeping up with the current circumstances such as higher manpower and transport costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, the community-based health and social care&nbsp;services are in great need for more support from the Government.&nbsp; Studies abroad have shown that home-based care saves the State thousands of dollars, and it is preferred by the elderly patients as well.&nbsp; The families find it less straining on their savings and time as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Readmission rates to hospitals also <p align=left>Column: 814</p>decrease when the continuum of care from acute to home care is smooth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I want to look at reaching out to the lower income elders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This House has debated on the widening income gap and schemes such as Workfare Income Supplements, Growth Dividends, Medisave top-ups, etc.&nbsp; It is the reality that with globalisation, inflation and crisis such as the current downturn,&nbsp;this will aggravate the situation further.&nbsp; In such times, it is the older people who will be hit the hardest.&nbsp; Their medical costs continue to rise, their&nbsp;problems get exacerbated and their mental health deteriorates,&nbsp;for example, they may suffer from depression or anxiety disorders.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to recommend the setting up of a fund to be called the Senior Pocket Money Fund, a counterpart to the School Pocket Money Fund.&nbsp; A start-up initial amount could be allocated by the Government and philanthropists, foundations and&nbsp;individual donors could contribute to it.&nbsp; Singaporeans are generous and I am sure there are many who will come forward if it is for the low-income elderly.&nbsp; It could be managed by a private/independent body, for example, C3A, and referrals could be from VWOs, FSCs, CDCs and&nbsp;medical social service departments of hospitals.&nbsp; This Fund would be for the needy older people above 70 years, especially to meet their daily and medical needs.&nbsp; A Committee could be set up to review all applications and the process could be made user-friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fund would symbolise our society's gratitude to the past contributions of our seniors whilst simultaneously respecting their dignity.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that a champion or organisation takes up this idea.&nbsp; And, here, I quote David Gutman who said:&nbsp; \"We do not have elders because we have a human gift and modern capacity for keeping the weak alive; instead, we are human because we have elders.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 815</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third and last gap in the social services is in relation to social and health services for people with dementia.&nbsp; The Asia-Pacific report, titled \"Dementia in the Asia Pacific Region:&nbsp; The Epidemic is Here\" (September 2006), was an eye-opener.&nbsp; It rang an alarm bell for countries in this region to wake up to the need for developing social and health services for this group of people, who are usually elders.&nbsp; Currently, there are 22,000 dementia patients in Singapore and annually 7,000 are being diagnosed with this debilitating illness.&nbsp; In addition to the suffering experienced by patients, their family members also undergo emotional and physical exhaustion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More day-care centres catering to dementia patients, especially those at the early and moderate stages, are needed.&nbsp; More custom built residential institutions will be required in&nbsp;the future, and a good model is the Apex Harmony Lodge.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a first-world nation, we have to be concerned about quality of care offered in our residential institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans travel more and they visit other countries and their expectations&nbsp;of holistic care, ie,&nbsp;physical, psychological, social&nbsp;and personal, are increasing.&nbsp; This is reflected in the survey conducted by Tsao Foundation on retirement destinations reported (<I>Today</I>, 14th August 2008).&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost two-thirds of the sample said they would consider migrating overseas for retirement.</p>\r\n</span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Lim Boon Heng):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank Prof. Kalyani for her suggestions, which are meant to be taken as inputs for policy formulation.&nbsp;I am sure that our agencies will study them as they review their policies and services.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 816</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first briefly explain our philosophy towards policy formulation and what we do for the people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want all citizens to be well prepared for old age.&nbsp; As they age, they should continue to lead active, secure and meaningful lives.&nbsp; Government policies will enable them to do so.&nbsp; But the individual must take personal responsibility on how he lives his life.&nbsp; When he needs care, the family should provide the first line of support.&nbsp; Then comes the community and the State.&nbsp; The role of the State is to support the individual and the family.&nbsp; With this philosophy, we have four&nbsp;strategic thrusts and they are:&nbsp;first, enhance employability and financial security;&nbsp;second, enable ageing in place; third, provide holistic and affordable healthcare and eldercare; and fourth, promote active ageing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have paid a lot of attention to ensure that people have enough money for old age.&nbsp; The CPF is the bedrock of our system.&nbsp; We save for our old age.&nbsp; Recently, we have made improvements to the CPF with the introduction of CPF LIFE.&nbsp; Most CPF account holders will get a stream of income for life.&nbsp; The low income are helped to accumulate CPF savings through the Workfare Income Supplement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work provides both income and active engagement for seniors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage re-employment.&nbsp; Legislation&nbsp;will be in place by 2012.&nbsp; We are also enabling Singaporeans to unlock the value of their homes if they need more funds in their old age through lease buy-back or change to smaller homes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few years ago, we started to modify our environment and public transport so that they are barrier-free.&nbsp; The lift upgrading programme is well underway, and so is the programme to enable buses to take the wheelchair-bound.&nbsp; New HDB apartments adopt universal design.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 817</p>Private developers are required to follow the new design code.&nbsp; Beyond the physical infrastructure, we are setting in place support systems to enable the elderly to stay with their families in their homes.&nbsp; This includes daycare services, home-help services and caregiver training and respite care.&nbsp; We will be guided by the principles that services should be people-centred, something that may be missing in the Many Helping Hands approach, as mentioned by Prof. Kalyani.&nbsp; For example, a centre for information and referral is being actively studied.&nbsp; And we should encourage various organisations that are providing services to the elderly not to be too narrowly focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes transport and manpower to deliver a meal.&nbsp; It takes transport and manpower to do home-cleaning services.&nbsp; If they can be combined, I think at least we save on transport.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I think there is a scope of things that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;look at when we talk about the people-centred approach to servicing the elderly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On holistic and affordable healthcare and eldercare&nbsp;&ndash; will the elderly be able to pay for medical bills?&nbsp; The 3M framework for healthcare is in place, comprising Medisave, MediShield and Medifund.&nbsp; It is sustainable.&nbsp; Improvements have been made to the system in the past few years and further improvements can be expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients can tap on Medisave to pay for treatment of chronic diseases.&nbsp; The poor are supported not just by polyclinics but also by GPs under the primary care partnership scheme.&nbsp; Currently, polyclinics handle 20% of primary care cases, and GPs handle 80%.&nbsp; We should keep these ratios, and enable the GPs to handle the health problems of the elderly well, so that they do not have to queue up at the polyclinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For long-term care, we have ElderShield.&nbsp; ElderShield was enhanced last year to provide better payouts in the event of severe disabilities&nbsp;&ndash; $400&nbsp;per <p align=left>Column: 818</p>month for six years.&nbsp; ElderShield is a sound scheme which allows for&nbsp;risk pooling.&nbsp; It allows&nbsp;the elderly and the family to decide how best care is provided.&nbsp; I know that some Members have in this House asked for a caregiver's allowance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This deserves careful study.&nbsp; In an ageing population, many of us will be caregivers.&nbsp; Who should provide such an allowance?&nbsp; We have to be careful about putting a price tag&nbsp;to what is traditionally a family duty.&nbsp; It may lead to unintended consequences.&nbsp; The way forward&nbsp;may be&nbsp;to build on ElderShield.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will study this; in fact,&nbsp;we are studying this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to caregiver leave, it is not a simple matter.&nbsp; It has to be arrived at with consensus of the employers because quite apart from childcare, eldercare can actually be a more costly item if we provide eldercare leave.&nbsp; So, it is something I would not rule out but we should not rush into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are reviewing the provision of rehabilitative services and social daycare,&nbsp;nursing home and caregiver training, taking into account rising demand, and including dementia which is rising in demand as well.&nbsp; I need to mention that home-help services are expensive.&nbsp; There are several service providers, but none have sufficient critical mass to be efficient and that is&nbsp;why the cost is so high.&nbsp; So, I think the way forward is consolidation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a need to change our perception of ageing.&nbsp; According to an international survey, people in Singapore sees 67 as the age when someone becomes old.&nbsp; In the US, the age is 77 or&nbsp;10 years later.&nbsp; If we remain healthy, there is no reason why we cannot be active until 80.&nbsp; We are old when we think we are old.&nbsp; Having a reason to wake up every morning or leading a meaningful life contributes as much, if not more than a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; Each of us has to find our reason for waking up&nbsp;&ndash; be it work, family or friends.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 819</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We set up the Council for Third Age (C3A) to change public perceptions.&nbsp; I think the work is important and therefore the&nbsp;C3A should focus on this task in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are working on a pilot wellness programme.&nbsp; It is aimed at keeping our seniors socially and physically active.&nbsp; It encourages seniors to take charge of their own health and join social interest groups.&nbsp; Such groups can be funded on sports, hobbies or even study.&nbsp; The wellness programme will connect seniors to other seniors and help them&nbsp;lead active and healthy lives.&nbsp; We plan to roll it out to all constituencies after the pilot programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With respect to Prof. Kalyani's point about a register for elders living alone, we can do this through the wellness programme and working together with the CDCs.&nbsp; In fact, this is what some of the pilot sites are now doing.&nbsp; I need also to say that if we have seniors engaged with their neighbours, then the incidence of <p align=left>Column: 820</p>loneliness and therefore suicides will be less, and the incidence of people dying alone will be less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I need to correct Prof. Kalyani&nbsp;who said that the rate of elderly&nbsp;suicides in Singapore has risen.&nbsp; In fact, I mentioned to the press after the <I>Straits Times'</I> report that if we looked at the rate over the past few years, we actually see a gradual decline.&nbsp; So, I think, we should not compare one year versus the next and say that there is an increase.&nbsp; We should look at it over a longer period of time.</p>\r\n</P></span></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker-->\r\n<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For a bus route to be wheelchair-accessible, two things must happen.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the buses plying the route must be wheelchair-accessible.&nbsp; The public transport operators are in the process of equipping new buses with wheelchair-accessible ramps, as they replace and renew their fleet. The Government is funding the capital cost of the ramps, which comes to about $21 million in total. By end-2010, 40% of our buses will have wheelchair-accessible ramps, and by 2020, all of them will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the bus stops along the route must be wheelchair-accessible.&nbsp; This involves replacing steps with ramps, removing potential obstacles and creating more space for wheelchairs to manoeuvre. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) is in the process of making all 4,500 bus stops in Singapore wheelchair-accessible by 2010.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two sets of improvements, to the buses and the bus stops, are coordinated between the LTA and the public transport operators so that we can roll out as many wheelchair-accessible bus services as possible to best meet the needs of passengers-in-wheelchairs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The criterion of requiring at least 80% of bus stops to be wheelchair-accessible, before designating the bus route as such, is to balance between the safety of passengers-in-wheelchairs and the speed of implementation. To fully ensure the safety of passengers-in-wheelchairs, ideally 100% of bus stops along a certain route should be made wheelchair-accessible before it can start serving passengers-in-wheelchairs. But we recognise that this will take some time. LTA had therefore worked with the VWOs representing passengers-in-wheelchairs, to find a way to accelerate the rollout of wheelchair-accessible bus routes without unduly compromising safety. It was after these discussions that all the <p align=left>Column: 823</p>parties concerned agreed to the 80% criterion, as a reasonable balance that can speed up the designation of wheelchair-accessible bus routes, while ensuring safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Mehta asked about information on WAB services. There have been extensive efforts to publicise WAB services through multiple channels such as news releases, educational pamphlets and information on online portals such as on SBST's website. The relevant VWOs have also helped to disseminate information to passengers-in-wheelchairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to take this opportunity to clarify that when passengers-in-wheelchairs are refused boarding, it should happen only on routes which are not yet designated for wheelchair-accessible service. This is in the interests of safety. To indicate a designated wheelchair-accessible service, the windscreens of buses will display decals. The recent confusion arose because decals were displayed on buses plying routes that were not designated as wheelchair-accessible. This should not have happened. SBST had since taken measures to remove the decals on buses when they ply non-wheelchair-accessible routes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me assure Members that LTA and the operators are working together as quickly as they can, to ensure that passengers-in-wheelchairs can use our bus system on as many routes as possible, and as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:JOBLESS SINGAPOREANS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:JOBLESS SINGAPOREANS:::826-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></b><p align=left>Column: 823</p><B><P>JOBLESS SINGAPOREANS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Assistance plans-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Assistance plans)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Acting Minister for Manpower with the expected rise in unemployment in the coming months (a) what plans does the Ministry have in place to help jobless Singaporeans; (b) what is the Ministry&rsquo;s plan to stem the tide of retrenchment; and (c) how is the Ministry helping non-unionised workers to be properly compensated when they are retrenched.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working closely with the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF) and NTUC to help both companies and workers to better manage the economic downturn and at the same time invest in skills for the economic recovery. There are two key strategies. First, we will work with companies and unions to explore various measures to help reduce manpower costs, including sending surplus workers for skills upgrading. This will save jobs for workers and upgrade their skills for greater employability in the long run. Second, we will help retrenched workers find new jobs and, where necessary, through appropriate re-orientation and skills upgrading courses so that they can seek re-employment as soon as possible. For this purpose, we have set up a tripartite taskforce to coordinate and facilitate these efforts.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first strategy, the tripartite partners strongly encourage companies to manage their excess manpower and consider retrenchments only as a last resort. Companies can re-deploy their workers to other areas of work, send excess workers for skills training and upgrading to enhance the quality of its workforce or adopt alternative arrangements such as shorter work-week. They can also manage their wage costs through the use of the flexible wage system, or implement temporary lay-offs. However, we understand that even with these measures, retrenchments may sometimes be inevitable. In these <p align=left>Column: 825</p>situations, companies are encouraged to discuss with their unions if they are unionised, and with MOM to ensure that retrenchment could be carried out responsibly and smoothly. Non-unionised workers who are affected by retrenchment can also seek advice and assistance from MOM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach to managing excess manpower is detailed in the revised Tripartite Guidelines on Managing Excess Manpower which my Ministry will release on 19th November 2008. We urge companies to apply these guidelines and take a longer term view to managing their manpower. Together, the tripartite partners will closely monitor the employment situation in affected sectors and will step up efforts to help companies and affected workers cope with the downturn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the second strategy, the tripartite partners will help retrenched workers find suitable jobs and, where necessary, help them to upgrade their skills to improve their chances of securing another job. There is a suite of training courses available for rank-and-file workers as well as Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs). Our Career Centres at the Community Development Councils (CDCs) and NTUC's Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) are also ready to provide career counselling, training support and job placements for the unemployed. Retrenched workers and other job-seekers could be deployed to sectors which are still hiring and have strong growth prospects. For example, it is estimated that the retail industry will need at least several thousand retail workers once Ion Orchard, Orchard Central and the Integrated Resorts are open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prime Minister has announced that we will be rolling out the new umbrella programme&nbsp;&ndash; the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience (SPUR).&nbsp; This tripartite initiative will encompass many of the measures mentioned above, to help employers and workers manage the economic downturn and at the same time reposition our workforce to seize opportunities when the economy recovers.&nbsp; My Ministry will release more details on SPUR shortly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:SAFETY CHECKS ON RECYCLED DRINKING WATER-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:SAFETY CHECKS ON RECYCLED DRINKING WATER:::828-->\r\n</B>\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 825</p><B><P>SAFETY CHECKS ON RECYCLED DRINKING WATER</P></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in view of the wide acceptance of using recycled water for drinking in Singapore (a) what are the safety checks in place to monitor and ensure that the membranes used to filter the water are in good working condition; (b) what are the additional safety measures to supplement the filtration process should there be any compromise in the membrane technology used by the Public Utilities Board; and (c) how is the system audited to ensure that there are no human lapses in overseeing the process.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Assurance that NEWater is safe for drinking and for use by the industries is a priority of PUB at all times.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given NEWater's high purity, it is largely supplied to industrial and commercial users with high end processes like wafer fabrication that require water of higher quality than for drinking. Currently, only a small amount of NEWater is blended with raw water in the reservoirs which undergoes further treatment for supply as drinking water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p align=left>Column: 827</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUB ensures safety standards by employing the following measures in the production of NEWater:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; A multi-barrier approach is adopted in the design of the NEWater plants. For example, UV disinfection is installed as an additional safety barrier, after the microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO) treatment stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp; A comprehensive preventive maintenance programme is in place to ensure all equipment and RO membrane treatment units are in tip-top working condition.&nbsp; The membranes are replaced at the end of their lifespan, typically every&nbsp;five to&nbsp;six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEWater plants are equipped with sensitive on-line instruments to constantly monitor water quality. Critical operation control points are set in the NEWater plants to raise alarms and alert the operators; plant operation will automatically shut down in the unlikely event of membrane failure. This has thus far not happened, but in such an eventuality, PUB can draw from service reservoirs to ensure uninterrupted supply of water to users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUB has in place a water quality monitoring programme to ensure that NEWater and tap water supplied by PUB are well within international drinking water standards including those of WHO and USEPA. About 290 parameters are monitored, which&nbsp;are more than the 130 parameters specified in international drinking water standards. More than 80,000 tests on water quality are conducted monthly, spanning the entire water supply network, ie, from reservoirs to taps, to ensure that the water is safe to drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The test results and plant design and operations are audited every three months by an independent Internal Audit Panel chaired by a water expert from NUS. This is further backed by an external audit every six months. The External Audit Panel comprises five overseas water experts from US and Europe and two local experts from NUS. This auditing framework has been in place since the introduction of NEWater in 2003. Both Audit Panels have consistently found high standards upheld in plant design and operation, and, most importantly, the quality of NEWater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:MEANS TESTING-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:MEANS TESTING:::830-->\r\n</B>\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 827</p><B><P>MEANS TESTING</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Subsidy for cost of medicine-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Subsidy for cost of medicine)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Baey Yam Keng </B>asked the Minister for Health whether the graduated subsidy levels under the means testing framework apply to the cost of medicine and how does the differential pricing of standard and non-standard drugs work under the framework.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From next year, all subsidised healthcare services used by Class B2 and C patients during their hospital stay will have the bills adjusted by the appropriate subsidy levels.

Indeed, no country takes such an approach.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead, like other leading regulators, HSA adopts an objective, risk-based approach, grounded on latest available scientific evidence. HSA regulates a number of products but imposes the most stringent controls on the two highest-risk categories of products&nbsp;&ndash; 'Western' pharmaceutical medicines and herbal Chinese proprietary medicines (CPM). Its risk-based approach comprises six key elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, all importers and wholesale dealers of these products have to be licensed by HSA.&nbsp; As part of the licensing requirements, they must comply with internationally established Good Distribution Practice (GDP). In this way, the licensees are fully reminded of their responsibilities and what they need to do to ensure the safety and quality of the products that they are dealing with. Currently, there are more than 360 importers on its register.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a rigorous pre-market assessment is made before a product is registered and allowed to enter the Singapore market. HSA will require the submission of the necessary documents and laboratory testing reports and review them. There are currently more than 5,000 western medicines and more than 8,000 CPM products on its register. Any importer who intends to introduce a CPM product into Singapore must submit two sets of documents: (a) the full formula of the product, which will help reveal the possible presence of any synthetic chemical or other prohibited substance, and (b) laboratory test reports on the level of any toxic heavy metal, such as mercury and lead, and the microbial content in the product. There are prescribed limits for these substances which CPM products should not exceed. Additional attention is paid to higher-risk products that are more likely to be adulterated, for example, those with claims of sexual enhancement or slimming properties. For these products, the dealer must submit additional test reports to show that the product does not contain any adulterant or other prohibited substance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, after initial approval, each time a batch of CPM products is brought in and before they can be sold, the importer must submit a letter of undertaking to HSA, confirming that the batch does not contain (a) any synthetic chemical or other prohibited substance, and (b) excessive toxic heavy metals and microbial contents. The appropriate laboratory test reports must accompany the letter of undertaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, an active post-market surveillance programme is carried out after all registered products enter the market. HSA carries out ongoing post-market surveillance to check on the safety and quality of products being sold. It has a system for picking up adverse event signals from doctors and hospitals if their patients experience side effects after taking the health products. This is an important part of post-market surveillance and allows HSA to <p align=left>Column: 831</p>take quick action to warn the public, investigate and, in severe cases, recall products that may be causing unexpected side effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, HSA carries out sampling and testing of higher-risk products to check that they meet specified requirements. If testing shows any deviation&nbsp;&ndash; for example, if a supposedly herbal medicine is found to be adulterated with a synthetic drug&nbsp;&ndash; HSA will mandate recall of the product from the market, and can take punitive action against the dealer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixth, HSA maintains an active international network of contacts amongst its overseas counterparts and other relevant scientific laboratories. In this way, we stay close to developments overseas and will be able to promptly follow up on any new risk factor that may have emerged elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our screening and surveillance system is based on an objective scientific approach in line with international best practice. However, at the end of the day, we can only minimise risk but not eliminate it totally. Routine testing of products can only look for known and expected chemical contaminants. If new, unexpected chemicals are added by an unscrupulous trader, existing tests will not detect them.

Firstly, we maintain an open investment policy and business climate to ensure that Singapore is competitive and sustainable for the long term.&nbsp; Secondly, the Government ensures that the necessary infrastructures are in place to support the continued growth of industries. Some newer examples of these include the LNG terminal, the CleanTech Hub@Jalan Bahar and the National Broadband Network. Thirdly, we adopt a regulatory framework that is conducive to business while setting appropriate standards to safeguard the well-being of Singapore.

Significantly, top-tier companies continue to invest in Singapore, adding to our vibrant business landscape of more than 7,000 MNCs, 46,000 international companies and 160,000 SMEs.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the global financial crisis, a diverse range of leading companies have embarked on factory openings or ground breakings recently, such as Samsung-Siltronic (Electronics), Halliburton (Oil and Gas), Rolls Royce (Aviation), Renewable Energy Corporation (Clean Energy), DigiPen (Interactive Digital Media Institute), Genentech (Biologics) and Intellectual Ventures (IP Management) to name a few.

Flat lessees are responsible for repairing spalling concrete as part of their effort to upkeep their homes. This is no different from private properties, where owners carry out repairs to spalling concrete at their own expense after the defects liability period, which is usually one year after completion of the development.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, on a goodwill basis, HDB would assist affected flat lessees by investigating each case, suggesting the appropriate remedial action and providing a list of possible contractors to engage. Over the past 12 months, HDB has assisted 2,300 lessees affected by spalling concrete in this way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, where the spalling concrete occurs in a \"wet area\" and resembles the effect of a ceiling leak, HDB will share half the repair cost with the affected lessee under the Goodwill Repairs Assistance, or GRA, Programme. For such cases, the lessee typically pays about $40 for his share. Among the 2,300 lessees I mentioned earlier, 1,250 fell into this category and were helped under the GRA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB's sharing of the repair cost for \"wet area\" spalling concrete is an extension of the goodwill co-payment that is offered for ceiling leak repairs that require both the upper and lower floor neighbours to work together.&nbsp; We have no plans to extend the GRA to cover all types of spalling concrete cases. However, as part of upgrading under the new Home Improvement Programme, HDB will repair all forms of spalling concrete at no cost to the lessee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HDB is continually seeking to improve the design and quality of its flats.

These forecasts were also in line with most market forecasts in February 2008. However, we also highlighted in the Budget the significant downside risks to growth in 2008 due to the turmoil that was ongoing in global financial markets. We also underlined the risks of higher inflation arising from the run-up in oil and food prices.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the year progressed, these risks have in fact&nbsp;materialised. Growth is now likely to fall significantly below the forecast range at the start of the year. Inflation also rose to above 6% in the middle of the year, although it is now falling together with the decline in commodity prices. Overall, inflation should average above 6% in 2008, or between 5% and 6% if we exclude rental values that are imputed to owner-occupied homes (which do not reflect cash expenditures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will be revising our budget estimates for FY08, taking into account the latest available information and the most updated forecasts for the remaining five months of the fiscal year (ending in March 2009). It would be premature to provide a precise revised forecast for the Budget at this point given the considerable uncertainty in global markets currently. However, I can provide a broad sense of what we are now expecting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had originally projected a deficit of $800 million for FY08 in the Budget. We now expect expenditures to be significantly higher than budgeted in view of the higher cost factors in infrastructural projects, additional spending on the new and enhanced Marriage and Parenthood measures, and higher payouts from the enhancements to Growth Dividends and U-Save rebates that PM announced in his National Day Rally speech. Further, there may also be some dampening of revenues in view of the lower than expected economic growth and more subdued property transactions, especially in the last two quarters of the fiscal year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should therefore expect a significantly larger deficit in FY08&nbsp;&ndash; possibly more than three times larger than the initially estimated $800 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are not seeking to reduce this deficit, either by trimming Government expenditures or raising additional revenues. The larger deficit is an appropriate fiscal stance in the context of an economy that has entered a slowdown. We have in fact raised expenditures over the course of the year, so as to allow for a more expansionary budget in the current economic environment.&nbsp; We will be able to fund the larger deficit from the surpluses we accumulated in FY07, when we had unexpectedly higher revenues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Budget Statement in January 2009, the revised budget estimates for FY08 will be presented along with the estimated budget for FY09.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:ENROLMENT IN FULL-TIME MADRASAH SCHOOLS-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:ENROLMENT IN FULL-TIME MADRASAH SCHOOLS:::838-->\r\n</B>\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 837</p><B><P>ENROLMENT IN FULL-TIME MADRASAH SCHOOLS</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Number of students-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Number of students)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Fatimah Lateef </B>asked the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs (a) what is the total number of student enrolment in full-time <I>madrasah</I> schools in Singapore for the last three years; (b) whether the numbers are stable or changing as there is a cap of about 4,000 students annually; and (c) whether the <I>madrasah</I> schools accept any foreign students, permanent residents or expatriate children.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

These include students who have International Baccalaureate qualifications, and those who have undergone an overseas education.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All applicants to our universities, whether local or international, must have completed the equivalent of at least 12 years of formal education leading to a high school qualification or equivalent.&nbsp; As such, applicants with international qualifications tend to be of the same age as local applicants.&nbsp; In a few countries, admission to university is possible after 10 or 11 years of formal education.&nbsp; Applicants from these countries may be considered for admission, but only if they provide evidence of very strong academic <p align=left>Column: 843</p>achievement.&nbsp; In addition, there is a very small number of university applicants who have qualified under special circumstances.&nbsp; For example, a few young talents aged between 14&nbsp;and 17 have been accepted by the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music for their exceptional gift in music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission to our universities for both local and international students is based on merit.&nbsp; No local student who qualifies for admission to our universities is denied a place.&nbsp; International students must also meet the entry criteria but, as there is a 20% cap on the number of international students, non-Singaporeans are, in practice, subject to more stringent entry criteria than Singaporeans.&nbsp; Our universities have acquired familiarity and knowledge with the various qualifications presented by overseas applicants, and are able to select top students from different education systems accordingly.</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Since August 2008, enrolment in childcare centres has increased by about 1,900 children or 3.5%, from a total enrolment of 53,000 children in August 2008, to reach about 55,000 children now. This is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase over the same period last year.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period, 114 centres have given notice that they will increase their fees. This is about 15% of all childcare centres. About one-third (36 centres) of these centres will effect the revised fees in January next year, while the rest are implementing the new fees late this year. The average fee increase is about $80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MCYS strongly urges operators to exercise restraint and to keep their services affordable for parents. Operators should bear in mind increased competition in the sector given the plan for a further 200 new childcare centres to be established over the next five years.&nbsp; We expect that parents will select childcare centres that best meet their expectations in the most cost-effective manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For low-income households who require further assistance in childcare fees, MCYS currently provides the ComCare 'Centre-Based Financial Assistance Scheme for Childcare' (CFAC). Eligible low-income families can benefit from up to $340 under the CFAC. This is in addition to the $300 subsidy for all children of working mothers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry will continue to monitor the situation and ensure that quality childcare services remain accessible and affordable to all Singaporean families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</p></span>\r\n\r\n\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\r\n\t\t\r\n<!--TITLE_NAME:IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ERP GANTRIES-->\r\n<!--END_COL_TITLE:IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ERP GANTRIES:::846-->\r\n</B>\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=left>Column: 845</p><B><P>IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ERP GANTRIES</P></span>\r\n\r\n<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Assessment of traffic flow situation-->\r\n<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Assessment of traffic flow situation)</B></span><div><BR>\r\n\r\n\t\t</B></span></div>\r\n\t\t<div align=left>\r\n\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\t        \r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng-->\r\n<span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Seah Kian Peng </B>asked the Minister for Transport if he will provide an assessment of the current traffic flow situation arising from (i) the phased implementation of new ERP gantries; and (ii) the revised charges to existing gantries, particularly those located in the CBD.\r\n</P></span>\r\n                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">\r\n<!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat-->\r\n<p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LTA phased in the implementation of new Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) gantries and the application of new ERP criteria on existing ERP gantries progressively, starting with the CBD and Orchard cordons in July 2008 before extending them to other areas.&nbsp; This is to give motorists time to adjust their travel plans and allow for the impact of ERP changes in the city area to work their way through the rest of the road network.&nbsp; If, as a result of the ERP changes in the city area, fewer motorists drive on the roads leading to the city, then ERP rates at other areas would not need to be adjusted if traffic speeds keep within optimal levels.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the implementation of ERP changes in the CBD and Orchard cordons in July 2008, traffic speeds in the city have improved significantly and are now within the optimal speed range.&nbsp; At the same time, LTA has also registered general improvement in traffic conditions on the roads and expressways beyond the city area during the ERP operating hours.&nbsp; Consequently, of the six locations that were planned in January 2008, only the gantry along PIE (westbound) near Eunos was implemented in November 2008, as traffic speeds at four locations&nbsp;&ndash; Commonwealth Avenue, Jalan Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road and AYE (westbound)&nbsp;&ndash; have risen to within the optimum range, while LTA will review if there is a need to implement ERP on Serangoon Road when traffic patterns have stabilised after its work with other agencies to study improvements to the physical environment in the Little India area is completed.
