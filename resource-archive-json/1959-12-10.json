In  fact, any other Government would  have\r\n\r\nmade  the  same,  if  not better,  provisions  for\r\n\r\nimprovement in the social services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, Sir, one fundamental\r\n\r\ndifference,  and this is the manner in  which  the\r\n\r\ntools of Government machinery are put to use. They\r\n\r\nbelieve, Sir, that to give better service  to  the\r\n\r\npeople, civil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservants   should  have  their  total   emoluments\r\n\r\nreduced  arbitrarily. They believe, Sir,  that  to\r\n\r\ngive  better  education to the children,  teachers\r\n\r\nshould be treated in such a manner that many  have\r\n\r\nnow  resigned. They believe too, Sir, that to give\r\n\r\nbetter  medical  attention to the people,  doctors\r\n\r\nshould  be  treated  in such a  manner  that  many\r\n\r\ndoctors have now resigned. And they believe  that,\r\n\r\nto  give better housing to the people, architects,\r\n\r\nengineers and others should be treated in  such  a\r\n\r\nshameful  way that many architects, engineers  and\r\n\r\nothers  have resigned. They believe that, to  give\r\n\r\nthe workers a better deal, trade unions should  be\r\n\r\nbrought  under firm control so that they will  not\r\n\r\nbehave  in  the manner that the P.A.P.  -dominated\r\n\r\nunions  in  the  past were wont  to  behave.  They\r\n\r\nbelieve  that,  to  win  over  the  confidence  of\r\n\r\ncapital for the economic development of Singapore,\r\n\r\ncapital  should be first frightened  away  by  the\r\n\r\nutterances  of  threats during election  campaigns\r\n\r\nand later coaxed by assurances that there would be\r\n\r\nno  increased  taxation, and that  the  Government\r\n\r\nwould,  by the exercise of firm control  on  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  see  that  there is no industrial  strife\r\n\r\nwhen the Party got into power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not subscribe to these beliefs. In\r\n\r\nfact,  we  abhor  such beliefs  because  they  are\r\n\r\ndamaging  to  the  interests  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance said, and I quote\r\n\r\nfrom Hansard, column 772:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"An elected Government which enjoys the support\r\n\r\nof  the  mass  of the people must have  objectives\r\n\r\nbasically  different from the Government  that  it\r\n\r\nreplaced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  if  by  objective is meant the many  beliefs\r\n\r\nthat  I have just related, then they can have this\r\n\r\nclaim  without challenge. But I think the Minister\r\n\r\nmeans it to mean the provisions in his Budget.  In\r\n\r\nthis I can see no basic difference, apart from one\r\n\r\nimportant  aspect.  He  has  submitted  a  deficit\r\n\r\nbudget  of  $6  million; he has indicated  in  his\r\n\r\nspeech of applications for supplementary votes  in\r\n\r\nthe   coming   months,  thereby  increasing   the\r\n\r\ndeficit; and yet he has taken no step\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  to  meet  this deficit  by  increasing\r\n\r\ntaxation on those who can bear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, Sir, that they have now come to the\r\n\r\nrealisation  that to save Singapore from  economic\r\n\r\ndisaster,  they  have to re-adjust their  attitude\r\n\r\ntowards  capital to repair the great damage  which\r\n\r\nthey did by the utterances of their threats during\r\n\r\nthe  election campaign. They are now anxious - very,\r\n\r\nvery   anxious   indeed - Sir,  to  win   over   the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  capital to help them  to  run  the\r\n\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the 1959 standstill budget, there was a\r\n\r\ndeficit  of about $4 million, and yet we, who  had\r\n\r\nbeen  accused by the P.A.P. as capitalist stooges,\r\n\r\nintroduced  increased income  tax  in  the  higher\r\n\r\nbrackets  and  company tax in order to  meet  this\r\n\r\ndeficit.  This was done at a time when we  had  to\r\n\r\nface the impending general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has announced one\r\n\r\ntax proposal. That is the imposition of port dues.\r\n\r\nAbout  this, let us see what he has to say. Column\r\n\r\n805 of the Hansard reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The port dues envisaged, however, will be modest\r\n\r\nones   and   shipping  interests  will  be   fully\r\n\r\nconsulted before they are implemented.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I repeat, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Shipping interests will be fully consulted\r\n\r\nbefore they are implemented.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the right step and is another indication\r\n\r\nthat  they do not want to offend capital any more.\r\n\r\nIt  would  have been a good thing,  Sir,  for  all\r\n\r\nconcerned,  if  they had only followed  this  same\r\n\r\nstep by consulting fully the Staff Side instead of\r\n\r\nimposing   arbitrarily  the   cuts   in   variable\r\n\r\nallowances.  Capital must be treated  gently,  but\r\n\r\ncivil  servants - they are after all wage  earners \r\n\r\n- should  go on their bended knees that  worse  has\r\n\r\nnot befallen upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance in the earlier part\r\n\r\nof  his  speech  devoted  six  paragraphs  to  his\r\n\r\nappraisal  of  the  economic  situation   in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya.  We  all  know  that   the\r\n\r\nFederation  is  now enjoying a  period  of  steady\r\n\r\nprogress.  But  this cannot be said of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a spirit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespondency, not only in business circles -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The  proposal  to  form   a\r\n\r\ncommodity  common  market with the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  is  indeed  a  good one  and  I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister every success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Why did you not try to do it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> In regard to Indonesia, Sir, I\r\n\r\nam   glad  that  relations  with  Indonesia   have\r\n\r\nimmensely improved.

But  the\r\n\r\nbuilding trade in Singapore, however, went through\r\n\r\na  difficult  period. Surely, the  Minister  knows\r\n\r\nwhere the blame lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his financial review of 1959, the Minister has\r\n\r\nquoted  figures  which  I  find  it  difficult  to\r\n\r\nreconcile.  On  the  one  hand,  he  said  that  a\r\n\r\nshortfall  of  $10 million on the tobacco  revenue\r\n\r\nwas   expected.  He  made  no  mention  of   other\r\n\r\nshortfalls. On the other hand, he said that if the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  not  acted  as  promptly  and  as\r\n\r\ndecisively as it did - and this, of course,  refers,\r\n\r\namong  other things, to the increased tobacco  and\r\n\r\npetrol  duties and the imposition of a tax on  the\r\n\r\nhire of films - there would be $4 million in revenue\r\n\r\nshortfall.  First, the Minister  said  that  there\r\n\r\nwould  be a shortfall of $10 million and  in  just\r\n\r\nunder two minutes I think, this shortfall had been\r\n\r\nreduced  to  $4  million.  Sir,  the  1959  budget\r\n\r\nestimated  a  total revenue of $265  million.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  in  his  speech said  that  the  revised\r\n\r\nestimates  showed  that  the  1959  revenue  would\r\n\r\namount to $258 million, whereas on page 16 of Cmd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(New Series) 32, the revised estimated total revenue is\r\n\r\ngiven  as  $259.2  million.  Sir,  accepting   the\r\n\r\nMinister's  statement of $258 million as  correct,\r\n\r\nalthough it is actually $259.2 million, there  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, a shortfall of $7 million. The Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  if  the Government had  not  acted  as\r\n\r\npromptly   and  as  decisively  as  it  did,   the\r\n\r\nshortfalls  would  amount to $4 million.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat   the   Government  did  act   promptly   and\r\n\r\ndecisively  by increasing the tobacco  and  petrol\r\n\r\nduties and by imposing a tax on the hire of films.\r\n\r\nBut  what I cannot understand is why, in spite  of\r\n\r\nthis prompt and decisive action, the shortfall  is\r\n\r\nestimated to be $7 million. If they had  taken  no\r\n\r\naction,  it is $4 million. Because they had  taken\r\n\r\nthis  decisive and prompt action, it  rose  to  $7\r\n\r\nmillion! Perhaps the Minister will try to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I base my speech not on what is in the\r\n\r\nbudget  but on what the Minister himself  said  in\r\n\r\npresenting  the  budget. I  would  urge  upon  the\r\n\r\nMinister  that  when he moves any motion  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  he  should be more attentive to the  facts\r\n\r\nand  figures and not expect the Opposition to wade\r\n\r\nthrough  a  mass of figures in order to  find  out\r\n\r\nwhere he has gone wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said in col. 776 of Hansard:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"For Singapore, the year 1959 had been a period\r\n\r\nof  some  uncertainty. The first half of the  year\r\n\r\nwas notable for a general attitude of wait-and-see\r\n\r\nadopted  by business enterprises. It was a  period\r\n\r\nof  comparative  stagnation.  The  reason  was  of\r\n\r\ncourse  the impending general elections, scheduled\r\n\r\nto take place in May.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nothing can be more true. But let us examine\r\n\r\nthe  real reason for this stagnation and for  this\r\n\r\nwait-and-see policy. This was because of the silly\r\n\r\nutterances  of  threats issued by  P.A.P. leaders\r\n\r\nduring the election campaign. And it is because of\r\n\r\nthese  silly  utterances that business enterprises\r\n\r\ncalled  a  halt and some of them even  removed  to\r\n\r\nKuala   Lumpur.  Now  the  Government  is   making\r\n\r\nstrenuous efforts to repair this damage by  giving\r\n\r\nassurances of no increased taxation. I have found,\r\n\r\nSir, that capital is less concerned with making\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  profits; what it desires most of  all  is  a\r\n\r\nhealthy  political climate, and  so  long  as  the\r\n\r\nclimate is right, business enterprises will remain\r\n\r\nand will expand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that the task of promoting the visitor\r\n\r\nindustry has been transferred from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nFinance  to the Ministry of Culture. The  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  describes this particular  important\r\n\r\nand  growing  industry  as  \"the  task  of  luring\r\n\r\ntourists  to our shores\". And because he considers\r\n\r\nthat  tourists have to be lured and not attracted,\r\n\r\nit  is but right that it should be transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Culture. I do not think, Sir, that\r\n\r\nGovernment is serious about the promotion  of  the\r\n\r\ntourist  industry.  The budget provisions  do  not\r\n\r\nprovide  for  a  senior  officer  who  knows  this\r\n\r\nparticular   job  and  I  would  urge   upon   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  that,  as the tourist  industry  is  a\r\n\r\ngrowing  and profitable one, it should  look  into\r\n\r\nand  strengthen  this particular  section  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the estimated revenue for 1960,\r\n\r\nthe Minister is rather optimistic as this is based\r\n\r\non  the  same rates of taxation in all fields.  He\r\n\r\nhas  estimated the yield from Income Tax to be $65\r\n\r\nmillion,  and  although this is $11  million  less\r\n\r\nthan that collected for 1959, I feel, Sir, that he\r\n\r\nhas  underestimated the adverse trading conditions\r\n\r\nthis year. The economy of Singapore has suffered a\r\n\r\ngreat blow as a result of loss of confidence among\r\n\r\nbusiness circles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards revenue from petrol, although the\r\n\r\nduty is now 20 cents a gallon higher than it was a\r\n\r\nfew  months  ago,  there is a  downward  trend  of\r\n\r\nconsumption    brought    about    by     economic\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  Less  and less  people  are  using\r\n\r\ntheir motor-cars for rides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister expects to collect $43.1\r\n\r\nmillion from tobacco, and this figure is about  $9\r\n\r\nmillion  more than in 1959. The Minister has  said\r\n\r\nthat  this  is based on certain assumptions  about\r\n\r\nconsumer  preferences but he is not  so  confident\r\n\r\nthat  these assumptions will be justified.  He  is\r\n\r\nnot so sure of the types of cigarettes people will\r\n\r\nsmoke in 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWill they smoke more imported cigarettes which are\r\n\r\ndearer,   or   will   they  smoke   more   locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured cigarettes which are cheaper? That is\r\n\r\nthe  question.  Sir, I say that  the  Minister  is\r\n\r\nrather optimistic, but then, who knows, trade  may\r\n\r\npick  up next year, particularly as the Government\r\n\r\nis  now  repenting the silly utterances of threats\r\n\r\nduring the election campaign and is going all  out\r\n\r\nto win over the confidence of capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to see that the Prime Minister has\r\n\r\ntaken over the direction of the City Council. This\r\n\r\nhas  caused  a  great measure  of  relief  to  the\r\n\r\nsuffering  public, and I wish to congratulate  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  for taking this  move.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter for regret that he did not do it earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with the Minister for Finance when\r\n\r\nhe  said  that the process of integration must  be\r\n\r\ncarried  out  in  stages, and  that  the  help  of\r\n\r\noutside  experts should be sought. I  am  anxious,\r\n\r\nSir,  that the gradual integration will not be  to\r\n\r\nthe  detriment  of the City Council  employees.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  receive  an  assurance  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  in the same manner as the  Honourable\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance has hastened  to  assure\r\n\r\nthe Civil Service, that such integration would not\r\n\r\nlead to an extensive retrenchment of personnel and\r\n\r\nthat  holders of posts found redundant and thereby\r\n\r\nabolished  will  be  given every  opportunity  for\r\n\r\ntransfer without loss of emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in regard to that part of the Minister's\r\n\r\nspeech on the Development Estimates. I will  touch\r\n\r\nupon  this  during the Committee stage; but  there\r\n\r\nare  certain points in his speech I would like  to\r\n\r\nmention  now.  It is clear, Sir, from  his  speech\r\n\r\nthat  there is no possibility that the Development\r\n\r\nEstimates will be put to full use in 1960, bearing\r\n\r\nin mind that engineers, architects and others have\r\n\r\nbeen  driven  to resign, leaving the Public  Works\r\n\r\nDepartment  and  the S.I.T. with only  a  handful.\r\n\r\nThis  is  indeed a setback to the Government,  but\r\n\r\nthis is of their own seeking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the building of more schools, more\r\n\r\nhospitals, more clinics, more houses, and  so  on,\r\n\r\nif  done  by  the  P.A.P.,  is  described  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance as adding\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the accumulation of wealth in this country and\r\n\r\nstrengthening the sinews of economy. But when  the\r\n\r\nsame kind of development was carried out by a non-P.A.P. government,  it is described  as  wasteful\r\n\r\nexpenditure  and a strain on the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That proves you are wrong!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The Minister, Sir, admits that\r\n\r\nthe  Government has to go overseas to recruit  the\r\n\r\nexpert  know-how  to help them  run  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board.  I can see  nothing  wrong  in\r\n\r\nthis. It is indeed a very wise move to recruit the\r\n\r\nexpert knowhow from overseas to help them run this\r\n\r\nvery  important  Board, but I  cannot  understand,\r\n\r\nSir,  why the Minister should have spent  so  much\r\n\r\ntime  to explain why this Government has found  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  do  so. It would  appear  from  his\r\n\r\nspeech  that  there is a group of  people  in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. perhaps, Sir, who are against this sensible\r\n\r\nand  realistic policy, and in this connection  the\r\n\r\nMinister said (col. 797):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"To these people, we can say with perfect candour\r\n\r\nthat  members  of the P.A.P. political  leadership\r\n\r\nare   not  lacking  in  talent,  vigour  or  self-confidence.

The\r\n\r\nMinister,  Sir, has found it necessary to  make  a\r\n\r\nstatement on this in his speech, but he has failed\r\n\r\nto  give  us  greater details. For instance,  what\r\n\r\nclasses  of  officers qualify for such allowances?\r\n\r\nWe  can think of some, but we do not know the full\r\n\r\nrange.  It  is  not improbable that anomalies  may\r\n\r\narise  and  what steps, if any, does the  Minister\r\n\r\npropose  to  take to correct such  anomalies?  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  if  Legal Officers get this  allowance,\r\n\r\nwhat    about   legally   qualified   men    doing\r\n\r\nadministrative  jobs? And  if  such  men  get  the\r\n\r\nallowance,   what   about   those   administrative\r\n\r\nofficers  in similar or more responsible positions\r\n\r\nwho   are   not  required  to  possess   a   legal\r\n\r\nqualification?  The Permanent Secretaries  are  at\r\n\r\nthe  top of the Civil Service, but if they are not\r\n\r\nprofessional men, maybe the officers working under\r\n\r\nthem  may  get more than what they get  when  they\r\n\r\nreceive  this allowance. It is an anomaly and  has\r\n\r\nto be corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister says that there are three\r\n\r\ngrades of allowances proposed. The highest is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, that to be paid to officers who have shown\r\n\r\nexceptional merit in their work. We do not quarrel\r\n\r\nwith  that grading. But what we would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to inform this House is  this:  who\r\n\r\nwill  be entrusted with the duty of assessing this\r\n\r\nquestion of \"exceptional merit\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the general run of Government employees we\r\n\r\nare told \"the Government is prepared to present  a\r\n\r\nscheme\" to relieve hardship. I can understand  and\r\n\r\nsympathise with the attitude of the Staff\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSide  on this question. Surely, Sir, trade  unions\r\n\r\nare  not  in  existence to help run an  agency  to\r\n\r\nassist their members to borrow money to tide  them\r\n\r\nover  any period of hardship. Trade unions are  in\r\n\r\nexistence   for   the   fundamental   purpose   of\r\n\r\nprotecting the interest of their members,  and  of\r\n\r\nseeing  to it that their members get paid  a  fair\r\n\r\nand  adequate wage. It is evident that  the  Staff\r\n\r\nSide   is  not  challenging  the  rights  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to impose a cut in variable allowances.\r\n\r\nWhat  the  Staff Side challenged, and  this  is  a\r\n\r\nquestion  which has been repeated  time  and  time\r\n\r\nagain, is the manner in which these cuts have been\r\n\r\nintroduced.  What they are fighting for  is  their\r\n\r\nright  to  negotiate  with their  employers  on  a\r\n\r\nmatter which adversely affects the pay packets  of\r\n\r\ntheir  members.  Sir,  will  the  Government,   in\r\n\r\nkeeping  with  their declared policy of  referring\r\n\r\nindustrial disputes to arbitration, implement this\r\n\r\npolicy in regard to their own employees?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has explained the economic\r\n\r\nsteps taken and has described the recent steps  as\r\n\r\nthe  use  of the big knife and the broad  axe.  He\r\n\r\nwent on to say, Sir, In column 803:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"They have been simple ones in that they do not\r\n\r\nrequire  detailed examination of  each  and  every\r\n\r\nitem  of expenditure.

Does  he\r\n\r\nmean that the cut in variable allowances, Sir,  is\r\n\r\non  a temporary basis? Or will the Minister please\r\n\r\nconfirm that he does not mean what he says?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister said, in col. 802:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is to be regretted that a number of officers\r\n\r\nin   administrative  and  technical   posts   have\r\n\r\nresigned.

The\r\n\r\nMinister  himself  admitted  that  there   was   a\r\n\r\nbuilding boom in Kuala Lumpur; and since,  in  the\r\n\r\nwords  of the Minister himself, prosperity in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  inevitably brings with it an  increase\r\n\r\nin  business  in Singapore, how is it,  Sir,  that\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur  is  enjoying a  building  boom  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is suffering the reverse fate?  Perhaps\r\n\r\nin  Kuala  Lumpur they did everything to encourage\r\n\r\ndevelopers. But certainly not here, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, barriers have been placed before\r\n\r\ndevelopers.  Whereas  in  the  old  days  electric\r\n\r\ncables  and  pipe  lines were put  in  development\r\n\r\nestates  for  developers because such  investments\r\n\r\neventually brought revenue to the City Council, it\r\n\r\nis  now up to the developers to pay for these.  In\r\n\r\nthe old days, if after five years - I stand open  to\r\n\r\ncorrection in the number of years - if the money for\r\n\r\ninstallation  was  recovered, the  developers,  if\r\n\r\nthey had put in the deposit, were allowed to claim\r\n\r\nthe refund. This is no longer the practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again on this point - the third point that I shall\r\n\r\nbe  giving - I open myself to correction - it is  said\r\n\r\nthat  the  City  Council  now,  when  working  out\r\n\r\ncharges for connections and installations, allow a\r\n\r\nprofit  for themselves - a very high percentage  of\r\n\r\nprofit - and this is not subject to query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The threat to close down the brick-works is\r\n\r\nsufficient  warning, Sir, that if unemployment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  not to be substantially  increased,\r\n\r\nthese  impositions should be lifted,  because  far\r\n\r\nfrom hitting the developers, it will hit the small\r\n\r\npurchaser - the wage earner, who perhaps in all  his\r\n\r\nearning  life has put aside some money  hoping  to\r\n\r\nprovide  a  roof over his and his family's  heads.\r\n\r\nAny  charge  that  the Government  forces  on  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers  is  going  to  be  passed  on  to  the\r\n\r\npurchaser. It is understandable that no  developer\r\n\r\nwill  run a losing business. Eventually it is  the\r\n\r\npurchaser  who  has  to pay for  all  these  extra\r\n\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister believes that local industry was adversely affected for a variety of reasons. A\r\n\r\nvariety  of  reasons was forwarded.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nthere  is  one  important  reason  that  has  been\r\n\r\noverlooked.   Local  products  are  cheaper   than\r\n\r\nimported products and, therefore, consumed by  the\r\n\r\nmiddle  and lower income groups. And these people,\r\n\r\nas I have mentioned before, having been hit by the\r\n\r\npay  cuts,  consumed less and, therefore,  it  has\r\n\r\naffected  local  industry; whereas imported  goods\r\n\r\nare  expensive and consumed by the rich and as the\r\n\r\nrich  has  not  directly or indirectly  been  hit,\r\n\r\nnaturally  that  explains why  trading  conditions\r\n\r\nhave shown an improvement of about ten per cent in\r\n\r\nrespect of imports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a common market with the Federation will\r\n\r\nbenefit  Singapore, I shall not make any  comments\r\n\r\nin   case  they  prejudice  the  chances  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  All  I  wish to  say  is - I  wish  the\r\n\r\nMinister  luck in this project, for, he will  need\r\n\r\nplenty of it if he is to see it through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister seems to be pessimistic concerning the revenue increase for 1960. He gives, as the\r\n\r\nreason  for this, the fact that revenue  has  lost\r\n\r\nthe  buoyancy  of the post-Korean war  years.  One\r\n\r\nwonders what part the transfer of firms, factories\r\n\r\nand  head offices from Singapore to the Federation\r\n\r\nplays  in  the loss of this buoyancy. The Minister\r\n\r\nhas  prophesied prosperity for the Federation  for\r\n\r\n1960, and he has also stated, as I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave   quoted  before,  that  prosperity  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  inevitably brings with it an  increase\r\n\r\nin  business in Singapore. It is difficult then to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why he should not be optimistic  about\r\n\r\nthe  increase  of  revenue in Singapore  for  1960\r\n\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of population, the Minister\r\n\r\npromised  to  make every effort to slow  down  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  population growth.  No  one  denies  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for  this, Sir, It is  hoped,  however,\r\n\r\nthat  the Government will find means and  ways  of\r\n\r\ncarrying this out without offending religions like\r\n\r\nthose of the Catholics and the Muslims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 1,109 new posts created for 1960, 80 are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  deletion of existing posts,  leaving\r\n\r\n1,029 for the Health and the Education Ministries.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  be obliged, Sir, if the Government  can\r\n\r\ngive   us  a  breakdown  of  these  figures.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  how many specialists, doctors,  nurses,\r\n\r\netc, for  the  Ministry of Health  and  how  many\r\n\r\nlecturers,  teachers, inspectors of schools,  etc.\r\n\r\nfor the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the absorption of City Council\r\n\r\ndepartments by the Government, can the  Government\r\n\r\nenlighten  us,  Sir, on the question  of  retiring\r\n\r\nbenefits?  Will the City Council employees,  after\r\n\r\nbeing absorbed by the Government, be eligible  for\r\n\r\npensions  that are enjoyed by Government servants?\r\n\r\nIf so, what happens to their provident fund?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the last few months, Sir, aids to T.B.\r\n\r\npatients   have  been  reduced  by  over   $30,000\r\n\r\nmonthly.  Will they be increased in  1960,  seeing\r\n\r\nthat  the Social Welfare and the Health Department\r\n\r\nexpenditures  have been increased by $2.3  million\r\n\r\nand $1.9 million respectively? Sir, it is not wise\r\n\r\nto  cut down the aids of the T.B. patients because\r\n\r\nthis  will bring more worry to the patients.  Less\r\n\r\nfood  means  less  nourishment and,  therefore,  a\r\n\r\ndelay  in  recovery,  which eventually  will  cost\r\n\r\nGovernment  more money. The Minister  stated  that\r\n\r\ncosts  for  the Survey Department and Trade  Marks\r\n\r\nRegistry must be met. I wonder whether it will  be\r\n\r\npossible to make these departments self-supporting\r\n\r\nlike the Telecommunications Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And can the Government tell us whether they have\r\n\r\nany plans in mind with regard to means and ways of\r\n\r\nincreasing   the  earnings  of  the  Airport,   of\r\n\r\nimproving efficiency and cutting down the cost  of\r\n\r\nthe Airport?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to Government's new development\r\n\r\nproposals, the Minister said [col. 794]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It may be that, taking into account the vast\r\n\r\namount  of planning and preparation that  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired  in  relation  to  the  availability   of\r\n\r\nengineers,  architects and others, there  will  be\r\n\r\nsome   difficulty  in  completing  all  the  works\r\n\r\nenvisaged.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Can the Government tell us, Sir, how available are\r\n\r\nqualified and experienced engineers and architects\r\n\r\nin,  let  us say, the P.W.D., S.I.T. and the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil? Secondly, what Government intends  to  do\r\n\r\nabout the extensive resignations of qualified  and\r\n\r\nexperienced  engineers and  architects,  and  what\r\n\r\nthey intend to do to prevent further resignations?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister stated that $7 million has been allotted to the Ministry of Labour and Law and\r\n\r\nthat  this will provide employment for a  residual\r\n\r\nof  unemployed. This gives the impression that the\r\n\r\nrest  of  the 45,000 unemployed would have already\r\n\r\nbeen given employment, leaving a residual of a few\r\n\r\nthousand  who  would  be catered  for  by  the  $7\r\n\r\nmillion. Will the Minister confirm that, with this\r\n\r\n$106 million allotted for development, and the  $7\r\n\r\nmillion  allocated to the Ministry of  Labour  and\r\n\r\nLaw for unemployment relief works, the problem  of\r\n\r\nunemployment in Singapore will be solved?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister stated that work brigades will be grouped in residential units. May I suggest, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat  this  may not be the best plan,  because  in\r\n\r\nareas where construction work on roads and bridges\r\n\r\nis  necessary, there may not be sufficient skilled\r\n\r\nand  experienced  workers in that particular  area\r\n\r\nand  the  conditions might be vice  versa  in  the\r\n\r\nother  areas. Would it not be better to  allow  an\r\n\r\noverflow of skilled and experienced workers of one\r\n\r\narea  into  another? Would it  not  be  better  to\r\n\r\ndivide    them   according   to   experience    or\r\n\r\nqualifications rather than do it on the  basis  of\r\n\r\nresidential qualification?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister announced that an allowance of $300 will be paid monthly to officers who show\r\n\r\nexceptional merit in their work. May I venture  to\r\n\r\nask  what would be the yardstick of measuring this\r\n\r\n\"exceptional  merit\", and who is to  measure  this\r\n\r\n\"exceptional  merit\"? If it is the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission, who will put up recommendations to the\r\n\r\nP.S.C.?  Who are deemed to be the technicians  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals who qualify for this allowance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has already been an open charge of banal\r\n\r\ndisguise  of individual motives, such  as  putting\r\n\r\nfriends  in  office in the name of efficiency  and\r\n\r\ncounting  on their support. This appeared  in  the\r\n\r\nPress. There must be some truth in this because it\r\n\r\nhas  not been denied and this charge has not  been\r\n\r\nmade  by  disgruntled workers or  Members  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  It has been made by a very  important\r\n\r\nperson   holding   a   very  important   post   in\r\n\r\nGovernment - a very prominent member of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nThe  fact  that  there has been a  racket  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter of appointments and that victimisation  was\r\n\r\npractised   in  order  to  create  vacancies   for\r\n\r\npolitical supporters, is common knowledge  amongst\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public in general, and in particular the\r\n\r\ncivil servant who has been living in fear of being\r\n\r\nthe  next  victim, would be very grateful  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  or to the Government if they would  give\r\n\r\nthem  the assurance that this gross injustice will\r\n\r\nnot  be  repeated  when measuring the  exceptional\r\n\r\nmerits of the civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also promised that Government employees who do not qualify for this allowance\r\n\r\ncan  obtain assistance to tide them over  for  the\r\n\r\nperiod of their financial difficulties. Sir,  many\r\n\r\nGovernment employees have been faced with hardship\r\n\r\ndue  to the variable allowance cut. Some have been\r\n\r\nforced  into  debt. I wonder what  the  Government\r\n\r\nplan to do with regard to the assistance promised.\r\n\r\nAre they planning to give them interest-free loans\r\n\r\nto  pay up their debts, and to do this on a  long-term  basis  so  that the monthly deductions  from\r\n\r\ntheir   salaries  would  not  bring  about   undue\r\n\r\nhardship?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister also accused the Staff Side of taking the attitude that further discussions\r\n\r\nshould  only deal with the restoration of variable\r\n\r\nallowances.  Sir,  surely this is  understandable.\r\n\r\nThe  employees felt that it was not fair that only\r\n\r\na certain section of the population should be made\r\n\r\nto  bear  the  burden of the State budget  deficit\r\n\r\nindefinitely.  After  all,  the  Minister  himself\r\n\r\nadmitted in his Budget speech that this method  of\r\n\r\neffecting  economies can only be  justified  on  a\r\n\r\ntemporary  basis. At a time when  Government  felt\r\n\r\nthat  immediate action was imperative,  the  broad\r\n\r\naxe was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now that they had six months to plan a new\r\n\r\nbudget,  is  it not logical that those  victimised\r\n\r\nshould  expect to be relieved of the burden  which\r\n\r\nthey felt had been unjustly forced on them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister admitted that there is little doubt that the civil service is going through a\r\n\r\ndifficult period. I would go further, Sir, and say\r\n\r\nthat  the  civil service has gone through  a  six-month  period of misery. The fact that there  have\r\n\r\nbeen   innumerable   resignations   from   several\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments - of  doctors,  specialists,\r\n\r\nteachers,    senior   officers,   engineers    and\r\n\r\narchitects - show that Government servants  are  far\r\n\r\nfrom happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this unhappy state of affairs has not\r\n\r\nbeen brought about, as the Minister believes it to\r\n\r\nbe,  by  the  exacting standards expected  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  the Civil Service or  the  speed  of\r\n\r\nMalayanisation.  Sir,  as I  said  before,  in  my\r\n\r\nadjournment  speech on the 2nd of  September,  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants have always risen to the occasion,\r\n\r\nand  if  they  are given fair and just  treatment,\r\n\r\nthey will no doubt again rise to the occasion  and\r\n\r\ngive  the  Government their loyal, their efficient\r\n\r\nand their valuable services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in our debate today I\r\n\r\ncertainly welcome one of the many speeches made by\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance. I have no hesitation  in\r\n\r\nsaying  that  the  time has come  when  we  should\r\n\r\nrealise and understand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfull  well the fact that this Government,  elected\r\n\r\nby  the  people  under the constitution  of  self-government,  will  not  deny  that  they  will  do\r\n\r\nanything  for the benefit of all sections  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  It  may perhaps  be  that  they  will\r\n\r\nexplain  the  mistakes which I am going  to  point\r\n\r\nout.  But I would like to remind them that  if  we\r\n\r\nwish   to  have  confidence  that  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nprosper  from year to year, then the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  should say specifically what is mentioned\r\n\r\nin the preamble to the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, although we are considered a minority group, there are many other minorities\r\n\r\ncomposed of foreigners domiciled here who consider\r\n\r\nthat  their  allegiance is undivided in  order  to\r\n\r\ndetermine  our every-day fate for the  achievement\r\n\r\nof  something good. In my opinion, Mr Speaker, we\r\n\r\ndo  need  to get money from time to time to  swell\r\n\r\nour  Treasury so that our Budget will  fulfil  the\r\n\r\nneeds  of  the  youth  in Singapore  who  will  be\r\n\r\nlooking   for  employment  and  those   who   need\r\n\r\nassistance. The fact that such a statement is made\r\n\r\nmakes  it  necessary, therefore, that we  consider\r\n\r\nthe  situation in which Singapore is placed.  And,\r\n\r\nas has been explained by the Minister for Finance,\r\n\r\nthat is, constantly to improve the trade relations\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia and matters connected with finance\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation of Malaya. But we cannot  deny\r\n\r\nthis matter or that our Treasury can be boosted if\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance had stated in his speech\r\n\r\nas  to  how we can give assistance, as I mentioned\r\n\r\njust  now,  to the indigenous people of Singapore.\r\n\r\nIn  our constitution there is provision for  that.\r\n\r\nBut  there is no mention whatsoever in the  speech\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister  for Finance.  Therefore,  I  am\r\n\r\ndoubtful.  If  we study his speech carefully,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  vacant posts for 1960 total  1,109,  but\r\n\r\nwill  these  posts  help the people,  who  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  just now need help? What are the  means\r\n\r\nwhereby we can help them? Can we render assistance\r\n\r\nto them merely by way of social aid without giving\r\n\r\nany  aid to raising their standard of living? Such\r\n\r\nposts,  it  can be said, in my opinion,  are  high\r\n\r\nposts.  If  we are going to take a census  one  by\r\n\r\none, I do not think there will be many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopportunities for people like myself. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI  hope we all are for prosperity, but here I wish\r\n\r\nto emphasise that whenever I speak I am accused of\r\n\r\nbeing  communal. But as to who is being  communal,\r\n\r\nonly  time will tell. Whatever be the methods they\r\n\r\nmust  help the lower strata. I wish to bring  this\r\n\r\npoint  to the attention of the proper authorities,\r\n\r\nso  that  they will know what is really wanted  by\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. which  is  also  represented   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Based  on such matters as  appointments\r\n\r\nfor 1960 - and surely the emoluments are big and the\r\n\r\nqualifications required are high-there is no clear-cut policy on what I have said just now concerning\r\n\r\nthe Malays in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, Mr Speaker, I also wish to be\r\n\r\nenlightened   by   Government  on   the   Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board. From what has been  emphasised\r\n\r\nby  the  Minister for Finance concerning  the  $20\r\n\r\nmillion  which  will  be handed  to  the  Economic\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, it could be said that  it  will\r\n\r\nbe  far from being of help to that section of  the\r\n\r\npeople  whom  I mentioned earlier on. The  Malays,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, are not communal, because we  agreed\r\n\r\nrecently  to  send our delegation to  sit  on  the\r\n\r\nOpposition side, because we do, in fact, need help\r\n\r\nfrom  our own Government and we did take  part  in\r\n\r\nthe promulgation of the Constitution. There is  no\r\n\r\nground  therefore to charge me as being  communal.\r\n\r\nThe  past  Government  did what  little  it  could\r\n\r\ntowards the Malays in Singapore. Therefore,  I  am\r\n\r\ngreatly shocked, Mr Speaker. I wish to remind the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  I was accused of communalism  by  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  when I spoke on  the  subject  of\r\n\r\ninternal security matters, in relation to the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan Negara. I hope that enlightenment  will\r\n\r\nbe  forthcoming  from the Prime Minister  who  had\r\n\r\naccused me before of being a communalist; but,  in\r\n\r\nmy opinion, what we need is to be able to stand on\r\n\r\nthe  same  footing  as the others.  However,  this\r\n\r\nmatter  will take time. We had hoped that  mention\r\n\r\nwould  be made in the first Budget - what assistance\r\n\r\nwould be given to the Malays - and not only to  the\r\n\r\nMalays  but  also  to  the  other  minorities   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I take this opportunity to bring  this\r\n\r\npoint home\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause,  although  we number only  eight  in  the\r\n\r\nOpposition, there will be a time when we will work\r\n\r\nhand-in-hand  with the Government. Under  our  new\r\n\r\nstatus  as  a  self-governing State of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the first time that we are debating  the\r\n\r\nfirst   Budget   and  U.M.N.O. wishes   to   draw\r\n\r\nparticular attention to the Malays who are in need\r\n\r\nof  help. I say that it is not possible now but it\r\n\r\nis  our  intention to free Singapore totally  from\r\n\r\ncolonial yoke in the future. I appeal particularly\r\n\r\nto  the Prime Minister who had said before that  I\r\n\r\nwas  a communalist, this and that. I say that here\r\n\r\nis  the opportunity, a golden opportunity, for the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister to prove his attitude on the  1960\r\n\r\nBudget.  It  could be mentioned in the scheme  for\r\n\r\nthe  Economic Development Board, amounting to  $20\r\n\r\nmillion how assistance could be given to help  the\r\n\r\nMalays  and also other minorities who really  need\r\n\r\nhelp.  If  they receive help, I am quite  sure  it\r\n\r\nwill be very much appreciated since no opportunity\r\n\r\nwhatsoever was given to them to improve their day-to-day standard of living. Therefore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nsuch being the circumstances, I would not speak at\r\n\r\nlength on other matters, but this is what we hope.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to reiterate in this Assembly once  again\r\n\r\nthat  although we, particularly U.M.N.O.,  may  be\r\n\r\ncharged as being communalist in the course of  the\r\n\r\npresent  Constitution, we will  continue  to  call\r\n\r\nupon the Government to state in no uncertain terms\r\n\r\nthe amount of assistance that will be given to the\r\n\r\nMalays in conformity with what is contained in the\r\n\r\nConstitution.  Otherwise,  it  will  be  left   to\r\n\r\nU.M.N.O. in Singapore to consider whether we  will\r\n\r\ngo forward or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nthe  Budget  speech of the Finance Minister  shows\r\n\r\nhow  difficult it is to try to serve two  masters,\r\n\r\nto  try to look in two opposite directions at  one\r\n\r\nand  the  same time, to try to please on  the  one\r\n\r\nhand  Party  supporters  and  on  the  other  hand\r\n\r\nmercantile  interests in Singapore.

In\r\n\r\naddition,  there is in motion there  a  successful\r\n\r\nprogramme of industrial development. Then he  went\r\n\r\non to express the following hopes. He said that in\r\n\r\nspite  of political differences he hoped that  the\r\n\r\nFederation would co-operate with Singapore as  one\r\n\r\neconomic unit. We on this side of the House,  Sir,\r\n\r\nshare  with  him in this hope. He also hoped  that\r\n\r\nthe  Federation, having welcomed the  transfer  of\r\n\r\ncommercial head offices from Singapore, would  not\r\n\r\npursue a policy designed to isolate Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are natural fears which we hope will\r\n\r\nnever materialise. But on the question of a merger\r\n\r\nwith   the   Federation,  we  already   know   the\r\n\r\nanswer - nil - because  the Singapore  Government  has\r\n\r\ndecided  to go left, or extreme left, whereas  the\r\n\r\nFederation Government has decided to go right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You really believe that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I believe that some new\r\n\r\nbasis  for reconciliation and unity must be found.\r\n\r\nI  do not believe personally that you can work out\r\n\r\nunity  and co-operate with Singapore on the  basis\r\n\r\nof  left and right.

I foresee that we are  going\r\n\r\nto face difficult times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here too, Sir, the Singapore Government has\r\n\r\nfollowed  a  policy known as restrictionism.  They\r\n\r\nare making things difficult for private capital to\r\n\r\ninvest in housing. Reference has been made to  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty in getting plans passed. At one time it\r\n\r\nwas  thought that, with Malayans in charge of  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T.,  plans  would be passed more  quickly  and\r\n\r\nmore easily. But we have heard that things are not\r\n\r\nas  we  have expected. There is greater difficulty\r\n\r\nin having plans passed now than before. Then there\r\n\r\nis  the demand of the City Council. Before housing\r\n\r\nestates  can  be  developed, the  developers  must\r\n\r\ndeposit  the full cost of laying the service  plus\r\n\r\n35  per cent surcharge. One company has decided to\r\n\r\nbuild  in Johore Bahru, not in Singapore.  Even  a\r\n\r\nschool is called upon to pay the full cost plus 35\r\n\r\nper  cent  surcharge. How can  we  expect  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital  to be interested in investing further  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  when  there are all these  difficulties\r\n\r\nand all these restrictions? And yet we are facing,\r\n\r\nas   the  Minister  for  Finance  has  said,   the\r\n\r\nnightmarish  problem  of  population -  a   rapidly\r\n\r\nincreasing  population with a  rapidly  increasing\r\n\r\nproblem  of mass unemployment. The Government  has\r\n\r\nbeen  very wise in providing $7 million  for  work\r\n\r\nbrigades  for the young unemployed.  But  we  know\r\n\r\nthat  this is only relief, a temporary relief.  At\r\n\r\nthe  rate  we  are going to do it, $7 million  for\r\n\r\n5,000,  just  to  help the present  unemployed  of\r\n\r\n45,000,  plus the annual increase of about 30,000,\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  be prepared to spend  on  relief\r\n\r\nmeasures  $105  million rising by  $42  million  a\r\n\r\nyear. Economically, the task is almost impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not an economic expert, but having read\r\n\r\nseveral  books, and having had also the experience\r\n\r\nof studying budgets for quite a number of years, I\r\n\r\nknow  that  in Singapore, we cannot follow  either\r\n\r\nthe  extreme  left kind of economy or the  extreme\r\n\r\nright   kind  of  economy.  I  suggest  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  sceptics  look  beyond  their   noses,\r\n\r\nbeyond  Singapore, and look at West Germany.  West\r\n\r\nGermany after the war suffered one thousand  times\r\n\r\nor  more than Singapore suffered with the pressure\r\n\r\nof 12 million refugees. They had a stupendous\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproblem,  but  what do we find there  today?  Full\r\n\r\nemployment  and  more than that.  104,000  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and 25,000 people from Italy were brought\r\n\r\nin.  Today 350,000 jobs go abegging. Sir,  wherein\r\n\r\nlies  the secret of this post-war German recovery?\r\n\r\nI  have  here, Sir, a book issued by  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGerman   Government  Information  Office  entitled\r\n\r\n\"Facts  about  Germany\". In 1949  they  faced  two\r\n\r\nalternatives.   They   could   adopt   a   planned\r\n\r\neconomy - planned by the State and controlled by the\r\n\r\nState - or they could adopt a free economy. They had\r\n\r\nto study the question, weighing the pros and cons,\r\n\r\nand  they  decided for a free economy, which  they\r\n\r\ndescribed as \"social market economy\". In  page  93\r\n\r\nand   onwards  of  this  book  there  are  certain\r\n\r\nstatements  over  which, I  feel,  the  Government\r\n\r\nexperts could well ponder:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"The growth of the West Germany economy took\r\n\r\nplace  under  the  German `social market  economy'\r\n\r\nwhich means the free development of markets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>And the next part to satisfy their socialist mind:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"with due consideration for both private\r\n\r\ninitiative and social progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exponents of free social market economy\r\n\r\nrealised that the state has the essential duty  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining order in the economic realm as well as\r\n\r\nin  others. But the basic principle of free market\r\n\r\neconomy is free competition. These exponents  are,\r\n\r\nhowever, aware of today's social demand and it  is\r\n\r\nfor  that very reason that the term `social market\r\n\r\neconomy'  has been chosen. It signifies  that  the\r\n\r\nunderlying principle of free market economy is not\r\n\r\na  fact dogmatically. Its limits are reached where\r\n\r\nsocial or cultural questions begin to clash either\r\n\r\npermanently  or temporarily with the principle  of\r\n\r\nunrestricted supply and demand. Now, an undeniable\r\n\r\nsuccess has been achieved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I commend that type of economy for the\r\n\r\nconsideration  of the Government experts  because,\r\n\r\nunless we find a solution to our mass unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem,  we  shall  not remain  on  the  economic\r\n\r\nplateau but go further down into the ravine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today there is too much planned economy from\r\n\r\nthe  Government. It looks wonderful on paper,  but\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  it will not work.  They  will  find\r\n\r\ndifficulties. People will not know what laws  will\r\n\r\nbe passed on a certificate of emergency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two theories on how to cope with a\r\n\r\ndeficit  in  the budget.

Previously,   the   Colony's   financial\r\n\r\nprosperity  was  due  to the  tension  created  by\r\n\r\ninternational  circumstances. If the international\r\n\r\nsituation  were  settled and the price  of  rubber\r\n\r\ncame  down,  there would be no prosperity  in  the\r\n\r\nColony. Such prosperity in the post-war years  was\r\n\r\nnot due to the encouragement or the endeavours  of\r\n\r\nthe previous Government, but due to the industrial\r\n\r\nprosperity created by international tensions  such\r\n\r\nas the Korean war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our Party has come into office, we are\r\n\r\ngoing to improve the social situation. We want  to\r\n\r\nplace  our finances on a stable basis. We  do  not\r\n\r\ndepend upon international circumstances to do  so.\r\n\r\nFrom  our  Finance Minister's speech  it  is  very\r\n\r\nclear  that  we are a Government with constructive\r\n\r\nand  vigorous  energy. Our economic policy  is  to\r\n\r\nbring happiness to the people and not depend  upon\r\n\r\ninternational circumstances. Since our Party  came\r\n\r\ninto power, we have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfaced  with  difficulties. We inherited  from  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government  a very  great  deficit.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister has pointed out very clearly that\r\n\r\nif   the  Government  wants  to  meet  the  budget\r\n\r\ndeficit,  there are three ways of doing this.  One\r\n\r\nis  to  borrow  money from foreign countries,  the\r\n\r\nsecond  is that the Government itself must  reduce\r\n\r\nadministrative expenses, and the third is to print\r\n\r\nmore  currency notes. The Lim Yew Hock  Government\r\n\r\nsold  Christmas  Island in order  to  balance  the\r\n\r\nbudget. If his Government had continued to  remain\r\n\r\nin  office,  they would have to borrow more  money\r\n\r\nfrom   America   or  other  countries.   But   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  cannot adopt such a policy.  We  must,\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all, try our best. We have adopted  the\r\n\r\nsecond method. We have reduced the expenditure  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government. The Member for Cairnhill had just\r\n\r\nnow  strongly attacked the reduction  of  variable\r\n\r\nallowances  for  teachers, doctors and  engineers.\r\n\r\nThey have criticised our cutting down of their pay\r\n\r\nand  therefore gave them cause for grievance.  But\r\n\r\nactually  what are the facts? The important  thing\r\n\r\nis  not whether the cutting down of allowances  is\r\n\r\nfair  or  not, but what is important is  how  they\r\n\r\nlive  after  their pay-cut. We have  merely  asked\r\n\r\nthose  who  were  in a privileged  position  under\r\n\r\ncolonial rule to make a little sacrifice  now.  If\r\n\r\nthey  have three cars, they could use one car,  if\r\n\r\nthey  have  three servants, they  could  have  one\r\n\r\nonly,  and  the money spent on the maintenance  of\r\n\r\nthe  other  cars  and servants  could  thereby  be\r\n\r\nsaved.  We  can make use of this money to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  standard  of living of the poor people  which\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be improved. When the majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople   in  our  society  are  living   in   poor\r\n\r\ncondition,  it is not reasonable to  let  a  small\r\n\r\nnumber enjoy luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has attacked us, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, that since it came into office\r\n\r\nit  has controlled the trade unions very strictly.\r\n\r\nThe  minds of the workers are very clear  on  this\r\n\r\npoint:  in  this  society, the new  Government  is\r\n\r\nquite  different  from the  old  one.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to strengthen the  influence  of\r\n\r\nthe trade unions and not to suppress them. We want\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthem  to realise that improvement of their  living\r\n\r\nconditions  is  connected with the  fate  of  this\r\n\r\ncountry. We want them to understand that  if  they\r\n\r\nwant  their  standard of living to  improve,  they\r\n\r\nshould understand the financial conditions of this\r\n\r\ncountry.  What we are trying to do  in  the  trade\r\n\r\nunion  movement is to let trade union leaders  and\r\n\r\nworkers  realise more fully the situation  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you can see very clearly that\r\n\r\nthe  Finance Minister is a very capable man. Under\r\n\r\nhis leadership, our Government has in a very short\r\n\r\ntime  balanced the Budget. He has also  made  many\r\n\r\nconstructive suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding external affairs, the Member for\r\n\r\nCairnhill just now praised the improvement we have\r\n\r\nmade, particularly the many things we have done to\r\n\r\nimprove relationships with Indonesia. What was the\r\n\r\nrelation  like  between  the  old  government  and\r\n\r\nIndonesia? What did the previous Government do  to\r\n\r\nimprove  relations with Indonesia? Under  the  Lim\r\n\r\nYew  Hock Government, Singapore became a base  for\r\n\r\nsubversive  elements  of  Indonesia.  This  is   a\r\n\r\nwellknown fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Cairnhill said he agreed\r\n\r\nto   our   creating  a  common  market  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, and he hoped that  it  would\r\n\r\nsucceed.  When he was Chief Minister, why  did  he\r\n\r\nnot think of this plan?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding internal affairs, first of all, we want\r\n\r\nto  integrate  all  the departments  of  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil  into the Government administration.  This\r\n\r\nis  being very smoothly done. In future, when  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Utilities Board has been set  up,  we  can\r\n\r\ndistribute  the work of the Rural Board  to  other\r\n\r\ndepartments; then the Government will become  more\r\n\r\nefficient and save much more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the position set out in the\r\n\r\nBudget for 1960 is clear. In the development  plan\r\n\r\nfor  next year, our Finance Minister has not  only\r\n\r\nbalanced  the  Budget, but has  acquired  for  the\r\n\r\nfirst time in the history of Singapore large  sums\r\n\r\nof money for development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTun  Lim Yew Hock said that he also had a building\r\n\r\ndevelopment   plan.   If  every   person   studies\r\n\r\ncarefully the geography of Singapore and  how  the\r\n\r\nbuilding contractors build their houses, in one or\r\n\r\ntwo  years' time there will be no space  left  for\r\n\r\nbuilding  projects. The Member for  Cairnhill  has\r\n\r\npraised our Industrial Development Board. Why  had\r\n\r\nhe   not  mentioned  his  own  Development  Board?\r\n\r\nBecause  he  had only $1 million for  development,\r\n\r\nand even then no progress has been made in the few\r\n\r\nyears.  The P.A.P. Government, however,  has  been\r\n\r\nclear  on  this  point. We  have  more  vigour  to\r\n\r\nimprove the industry of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill has reminded us to\r\n\r\npromote  the  tourist trade in Singapore.  In  the\r\n\r\npast, the previous Government used public funds to\r\n\r\ngive   free  advertisement  for  the  big  hotels,\r\n\r\nrestaurants and cinemas. We will never do  such  a\r\n\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill also touched on the\r\n\r\nReport  of Dr Gwee Ah Leng, and has asked  us  to\r\n\r\nshow  our  attitude  towards  it.  He  seems  very\r\n\r\nconcerned about this matter. I do not know whether\r\n\r\nhe  knows  the  damaging  effects  caused  by  his\r\n\r\nGovernment  saying  that  it  wanted  to  give  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  to  Nanyang University. We are  going  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  Nanyang University, but  the  point  is\r\n\r\nwhether  it is practicable as far as finances  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.  We  have to use the  money  reasonably\r\n\r\nwith  regard to Nanyang University. This is a very\r\n\r\ncomplicated    question    and    needs    careful\r\n\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members criticised us and said\r\n\r\nthat  the Civil servants are afraid of us and many\r\n\r\nhave resigned. This is not a fact. The achievement\r\n\r\nof  the  Government in its six months'  of  office\r\n\r\ncould  not have been realised only through its  43\r\n\r\nMembers  here.  Without the civil  servants  these\r\n\r\nachievements  would  not have been  possible.  The\r\n\r\nFinance Minister has thanked his staff for helping\r\n\r\nhim  to  prepare a balanced Budget.  This  clearly\r\n\r\nshows   their  faith  in  the  Government.

Government. They\r\n\r\nwork  very  hard,  and  so are  confident  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  In  the  past  week,  the  Government\r\n\r\ncelebrated  National Loyalty Week  and  the  Civil\r\n\r\nservants  in  Radio Singapore and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture  have helped a lot to make it  a  success.\r\n\r\nThose who are afraid of the P.A.P.

When they  are\r\n\r\nbrought  under  the  new  rule,  they  are  afraid\r\n\r\nbecause they cannot escape from it. The fact  that\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members  defended them  clearly  shows\r\n\r\nthat they are of the same type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our financial policy was announced to the\r\n\r\npublic,  businessmen and others in  all  walks  of\r\n\r\nlife  have expected 1960 to be a prosperous  year.\r\n\r\nWe  are still not satisfied with this. We are  not\r\n\r\nover-optimistic because, in the long run,  we  may\r\n\r\nbe  faced  with  many difficulties  due  to  over-population  and the lack of land. If  we  want  to\r\n\r\nbetter our social circumstances, we have to depend\r\n\r\nupon a merger with the Federation. We have to  rid\r\n\r\nourselves  of this semi-colonialism  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsolve our financial problems. Fundamentally, it is\r\n\r\na difficult task, but our Government has presented\r\n\r\na  favourable financial Budget in our first  year.\r\n\r\nIt  tells  all  the people of Singapore  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  is a responsible, logical, reasonable,\r\n\r\nand a talented Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it is a convenient time to\r\n\r\nsuspend.

Like\r\n\r\nall  empty vessels, they make the most noise.  And\r\n\r\nin  doing  so,  they have echoed the emptiness  of\r\n\r\ntheir ideas and ideals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten, in particular, should\r\n\r\nascertain  the  accuracy of her statements  before\r\n\r\nbringing  wild allegations against the  Government\r\n\r\nbenches.   I   speak   of  her  allegations   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  cut  tuberculosis  allowances  to\r\n\r\naggravate   the   situation  of  tuberculosis   in\r\n\r\nSingapore. This, I feel, is a calculated  move  on\r\n\r\nher  part  to  discredit the Government  on  false\r\n\r\npremises.  I  would like to clarify the  situation\r\n\r\nhere,  and perhaps give the hon. Member here  some\r\n\r\naccurate information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tuberculosis allowance was instituted some\r\n\r\nfew  years ago to remedy the rapidly deteriorating\r\n\r\ncircumstances created by the dreadful disease. The\r\n\r\nallowance  is  given especially for  patients  who\r\n\r\nhave  been certified by medical experts  of  their\r\n\r\ncurability.  The recipient of this allowance  must\r\n\r\nhave  a  good prognosis - a good chance of recovery,\r\n\r\nand this allowance is only given to people who, in\r\n\r\nthe  opinion of the chest physician, will  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  a  rest  from  work. As soon  as  the  chest\r\n\r\nphysician feels that the patient is well enough to\r\n\r\ngo  back  to  work,  his T.B. allowance  will  be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued. The People's Action Party Government\r\n\r\nhas  never cut these allowances as implied by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Mountbatten. What the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty Government did in September was to impose  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  on  these allowances because the  way  in\r\n\r\nwhich  these allowances were given was subject  to\r\n\r\nabuse.  It  was  known that certain  sufferers  of\r\n\r\ntuberculosis  in Singapore were receiving  a  T.B.\r\n\r\nallowance of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nover $300 per month, a really fantastic figure  in\r\n\r\ncomparison  with the salary given to  the  working\r\n\r\nclass.  The Government fixed this maximum at  $180\r\n\r\nper  month  as from September this year and  there\r\n\r\nwere  no  cuts  whatsoever  imposed  on  the  T.B.\r\n\r\nallowances except the removal of the 10  per  cent\r\n\r\nC.O.L. allowance  which was  added  to  the  T.B.\r\n\r\nallowance  in 1951 due to the inflation then.  The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has on no occasion cut any  allowances\r\n\r\non  tuberculosis. In fact, the Government is  well\r\n\r\naware  that tuberculosis is a big problem in  this\r\n\r\ncountry,  and the Ministry of Health in particular\r\n\r\nhas  planned schemes to provide compulsory  B.C.G.\r\n\r\nvaccination  for  all  the  people  of   Singapore\r\n\r\nvulnerable   to  the  scourge  of  this   dreadful\r\n\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like to ask the Opposition Members at present\r\n\r\nnot  to  make  wild allegations and  frighten  the\r\n\r\npeople   of  Singapore  with  speeches   in   this\r\n\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Ministry of Health is concerned, in\r\n\r\naccordance with the declared policy of the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, we are spending more money  next  year\r\n\r\nso  as  to  provide the people of  Singapore  with\r\n\r\nbetter facilities for health and medical care.  In\r\n\r\nthe  Development Estimates alone, a  sum  of  more\r\n\r\nthan $8 million has been allotted to cope with the\r\n\r\nplanned  expansion  of  the  medical  and   health\r\n\r\nservices   for  the  benefit  of  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore. Though the sum is only $2,825,000  more\r\n\r\nthan  the Development Estimates for 1959, we  are\r\n\r\nconfident  of  achieving a much better  result  by\r\n\r\ncareful  and  realistic planning. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth has always received substantial grants  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the past years. But  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment stressed on the architectural beauty of\r\n\r\nhospital  buildings rather than  realistic  needs.\r\n\r\nThis  was  perhaps a scheme on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government to pull  the  wool  over  the\r\n\r\npeople's  eyes. Let us take a look  at  the  white\r\n\r\nelephant  of the S.P.A. Government at the  Thomson\r\n\r\nRoad  Hospital for the chronic sick. The buildings\r\n\r\nalone were erected at a cost of some $4,650,000 to\r\n\r\nhouse just 396 chronic patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is pertinent here, Sir, to mention that chronic\r\n\r\npatients  once admitted to a hospital are unlikely\r\n\r\nto  be  discharged  at all. That  is  to  say  the\r\n\r\nturnover  of the chronic hospital will  be  almost\r\n\r\nnil,  or at any rate very, very small once it  has\r\n\r\nbeen  filled up initially. This shows the  failure\r\n\r\nof  the  previous Government to grasp the  problem\r\n\r\nsocially  and economically, much less politically.\r\n\r\nThe  previous Government was prepared  to  sink  a\r\n\r\ncapital  expenditure  of $12,000  per  patient  in\r\n\r\nbuildings  alone  to  solve  the  problem  of  the\r\n\r\nchronic sick. This kind of shortsightedness on the\r\n\r\npart  of the previous Government resulted  in  the\r\n\r\ndeprivation  of  medical care for  many  of  those\r\n\r\nneedy and sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing the Minister for Health did when\r\n\r\nhe  assumed  office  was to make  a  thorough  and\r\n\r\noverall   inspection   of   all   hospitals    and\r\n\r\ninstitutions  in the Ministry of Health.  We  were\r\n\r\naghast  to  see an impressive building beautifully\r\n\r\nlaid  out,  perhaps,  to rest  in  peace,  if  the\r\n\r\nprevious Government had its way, at Thomson  Road.\r\n\r\nIt  was  declared open by the previous  Government\r\n\r\njust  before  the elections as an election  stunt,\r\n\r\nand  left empty to stand as a monument of masterly\r\n\r\ninactivity on the part of the S.P.A. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Government is not interested in window\r\n\r\ndressing. We are interested only in resolving  the\r\n\r\nneeds of our people. The $8\ufffd million will be spent\r\n\r\nin  realistic  expansion of  the  health  services\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the economical capacity  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry.  New  economical  and  utility  types  of\r\n\r\nmedical units will be designed and built all  over\r\n\r\nthe  island in an attempt to decentralise the out-patient  services  in order to  really  and  truly\r\n\r\nbring  health to the door steps of all the  people\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main item of expenditure in the Health\r\n\r\nMinistry  falls  on  personal  emoluments,   which\r\n\r\naccount  for  some  $22\ufffd  million.  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nfortunate in having a medical school for more than\r\n\r\nhalf  a century. This has resulted in the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Health being almost Malayanised. But there  is\r\n\r\nno denying the fact that there is still a shortage\r\n\r\nof doctors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin Singapore. This shortage has adversely affected\r\n\r\nour doctors in two ways. Firstly, the doctors were\r\n\r\noverworked to cope with the demands of the  health\r\n\r\nservice, and secondly, due to the inability of the\r\n\r\nservice  to  spare the doctors to go abroad,  they\r\n\r\nwere    unable   to   go   overseas   for   higher\r\n\r\nqualifications which are so essential today in the\r\n\r\nface  of  rapid scientific advance and  increasing\r\n\r\nmedical specialisation. Our medical school,  which\r\n\r\nmaintains  a  very  high standard,  is  unable  to\r\n\r\ndouble   its  student  intake  at  short   notice.\r\n\r\nGovernment has, therefore, decided to send some 80\r\n\r\nto   120  students  annually  abroad  for  medical\r\n\r\ntraining. However, it takes at least six years  to\r\n\r\ntrain  a  doctor. Therefore, to meet  the  present\r\n\r\nneeds,  we  have decided to recruit  doctors  from\r\n\r\noverseas  on  short-term contract.  This  probably\r\n\r\nanswers  the  point  raised  by  the  Member   for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  on  the  situation of  the  doctors  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the People's Action Party formed the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  the  standard of  hospital  care  has\r\n\r\nimproved   tremendously,   particularly   at   the\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital and at the Trafalgar Home.  At\r\n\r\nthe  Kandang Kerbau Hospital too, improvement  has\r\n\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-patient services still remain congested\r\n\r\nand  overcrowded, despite new extensions and added\r\n\r\nstaff.  This is because we are treating more  than\r\n\r\ndouble  the  number of patients daily as  compared\r\n\r\nwith  the number at the beginning of the year.  It\r\n\r\nis  expected that the present congestion will only\r\n\r\nbe  eased  by  complete  decentralisation  of  the\r\n\r\noutpatient  services  in  the  future.  The   same\r\n\r\napplies to the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. And it  is\r\n\r\nthe   Government's  intention   to   build   large\r\n\r\nmaternity homes to solve the congestion at Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore boasts of a very high standard of\r\n\r\nhealth  in  South East Asia. A rapidly  decreasing\r\n\r\ndeath  rate and a fast increasing birth rate  have\r\n\r\nbrought us new problems. The population is growing\r\n\r\nat  the rate of 70,000 a year. This Government  is\r\n\r\nplanning  a campaign to reduce the birth  rate  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  early next year. Many of us  here  feel\r\n\r\nthat family planning should be easy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  implement.  But I would like to  mention  here\r\n\r\nthat from the social-medical point of view, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so. It must not be forgotten that to many  of\r\n\r\nthe  poor, sexual relationship remains perhaps the\r\n\r\nonly  form  of  recreation they can afford.  After\r\n\r\nall,  the  Government takes care of  the  pregnant\r\n\r\nmother  and  the  infant baby completely  free  of\r\n\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.43 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the debate on\r\n\r\nthe Singapore budget, I wish to draw the attention\r\n\r\nof  the  Government to the fact  that  it  is  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  of  the  Opposition   Members   to\r\n\r\ncriticise  constructively in the interest  of  all\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore. What I am surprised at is\r\n\r\nthe  fact that the Government considers that  only\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government is sincere, and that it  is\r\n\r\nthe  only  Government who wish to  help  the  poor\r\n\r\nmasses: and that other than the P.A.P. Government,\r\n\r\nothers do not have the interests of the people  at\r\n\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the speeches made by the Government\r\n\r\nbackbenchers, the facts are contradictory to  what\r\n\r\nhas  already  been explained by the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  in  his Budget speech. For instance,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, the speech by the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the Prime Minister, who stated that there  are\r\n\r\ntwo  ways  to improve the budget position  of  the\r\n\r\nState - by a reduction of administrative expenditure\r\n\r\nso  that  the masses will benefit, or by means  of\r\n\r\nborrowing  money,  whether  from  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore or from countries outside Singapore.  We\r\n\r\nadmit  that  these  are two ways  which  can  help\r\n\r\nSingapore   to  attain  a  state  of   peace   and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  so that the people will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ntaste  the good things in life and there  will  be\r\n\r\nassurances  for their children and  their  future.\r\n\r\nHowever,  what we are concerned with,  as  I  said\r\n\r\nearlier  on,  is that the Government  assume  that\r\n\r\nthey  alone can bring about an improvement to  the\r\n\r\nmasses, but the ways and means by which they spend\r\n\r\nthe  State's money is a matter with which  we  too\r\n\r\nare   concerned.   Indiscriminate   spending,   or\r\n\r\nspending to suit their own political ends - this  is\r\n\r\nour concern, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have just received an answer from the relevant ministry to which a question was\r\n\r\nposed,   concerning  the  formation  of  voluntary\r\n\r\ncontingents the members of which were given $3 per\r\n\r\nday.  That was done without consultation with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour. This we consider  is  a  big\r\n\r\nmatter for Singapore in regard to the unemployment\r\n\r\nproblem.  The  Government  also  admits  that  the\r\n\r\nmembers   of   the  contingent  comprised   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmembers,  or at least the great majority  of  them\r\n\r\ncomprised  P.A.P. members. Here it is obvious  and\r\n\r\napparent  that the whispers circulating among  ths\r\n\r\nmasses  do  indeed  have  substance.  The  general\r\n\r\nopinion  of the masses is that if you are  looking\r\n\r\nfor  employment you have got to be a member of the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   This   is   an  act  which   I   consider\r\n\r\ndisappointing and disgusting to the tax payers who\r\n\r\ncontribute  much  to  the  State.  That  kind   of\r\n\r\nattitude   is   basically   wrong,   because   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   constitutionally   formed,    should\r\n\r\nprotect  the  interests of  the  population  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole,  irrespective of whether they are following\r\n\r\nthe ideologies of the party in power or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to make on this\r\n\r\nbudget  issue  is this. After the  P.A.P. assumed\r\n\r\noffice,    the   Prime   Minister   issued    many\r\n\r\nannouncements, which were the same statements made\r\n\r\nduring  the  election period, that is to  say,  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  standard of living of those  who  were\r\n\r\nneglected  and ignored by the previous government.\r\n\r\nI  wish  to  remind the House and to stress  here,\r\n\r\nthat  the position of the past Government differed\r\n\r\nfrom that of the present government which is under\r\n\r\na different constitution altogether. The powers of\r\n\r\nthe  past  Government  and those  of  the  present\r\n\r\nGovernment under the new constitution also differ.\r\n\r\nI am here not to defend the past government. But I\r\n\r\nhave  stressed  on  many  occasions  that  we  are\r\n\r\nheading for a definite objective, that is to  say,\r\n\r\nto  shape a nation without discriminating  between\r\n\r\none  community  and another, and I find  that  the\r\n\r\nattitude or action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken by the present Government is disgusting. The\r\n\r\nGovernment should realise that the aim of building\r\n\r\nour  nation  is  a  big task.  Hence  a  socialist\r\n\r\nideology, I fear, will be a deterrent towards  the\r\n\r\nshaping of a common nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, once again I stress that it is up to the P.A.P. Government to make good. Before they\r\n\r\nassumed  office, they made promises  to  the  poor\r\n\r\nmasses,  for  instance, to the fishermen  and  the\r\n\r\nfarmers,  because they considered that these  were\r\n\r\nthe  people who were oppressed by the capitalists.\r\n\r\nBut  what I find in the Budget submitted  is  that\r\n\r\nsuch  matters as affect these particular  sections\r\n\r\nof  the  masses are not mentioned. As I have  said\r\n\r\nconcerning  the fishermen, they are  oppressed  by\r\n\r\nmiddlemen. Therefore, it is indeed necessary  that\r\n\r\ntheir problem should be given prime consideration.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  should  help  by  giving   these\r\n\r\nfishermen assistance in the form of capital  loans\r\n\r\nto  enable  them  to  buy new equipment  or  gear.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I am of the opinion that this  will  not\r\n\r\nreally  solve the crux of their problem. They  can\r\n\r\nstill  catch fish, but the real problem  they  are\r\n\r\nfaced with is that after the catch, where are they\r\n\r\ngoing  to  dispose  of their catch?  If  they  are\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  form a co-operative society,  they\r\n\r\nwill  find it difficult to dispose of their catch.\r\n\r\nThe  prices offered for their catch in the  market\r\n\r\nare  very low indeed. The prices offered to people\r\n\r\nwho  bring  in  the fish vary. For  instance,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  if the fish is brought to the market  by\r\n\r\nthe  regular persons these people will be  offered\r\n\r\nfixed or regular prices. However, if the fishermen\r\n\r\nthemselves  bring their catch to the  market,  the\r\n\r\nprices offered them will be considerably lower  or\r\n\r\nhalf  of  what has been offered to the  middlemen.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I  consider there is no other  way  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the fishermen than by establishing a central\r\n\r\nmarketing  board, administered by the  Government,\r\n\r\nfor  the  purpose  of fixing the  prices  of  fish\r\n\r\nirrespective  of who brings it in,  and  then  the\r\n\r\ncatch  can be sold to the retailers. There  is  no\r\n\r\nother way I can think of to help the fishermen out\r\n\r\nthere. I am not saying that the other ways are not\r\n\r\npractical,  but  it  is  important  to  help   the\r\n\r\nfishermen living\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin the islands to solve their real problems and to\r\n\r\nimprove  their living standards. Not much  purpose\r\n\r\ncan  be  achieved by providing them with community\r\n\r\ncentres  or clinics alone if we do not  look  into\r\n\r\ntheir economic aspect as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from that, Mr Speaker, concerning the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  mentioned in the  speech  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, originally it was decided to\r\n\r\nchange  the system. In column 802 of the  Hansard,\r\n\r\nhe says (I will read it in English):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"It is intended next year to make a review of the\r\n\r\nstaffing position to ensure that there is  a  hard\r\n\r\ncore  of  experienced officers in all Departments,\r\n\r\nand   that  opportunities  will  be  provided  for\r\n\r\naccelerated  promotion to those local officers  of\r\n\r\nmerit  and  ability who are prepared  to  give  of\r\n\r\ntheir best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued in Malay): Mr Speaker, in the last\r\n\r\nsentence which reads, \"who are prepared to give of\r\n\r\ntheir best\" I think that is incomplete. This is  a\r\n\r\nmatter about which we are uneasy. From that speech\r\n\r\nthere  are rumours that the civil servants  wonder\r\n\r\nhow  they  are  to  receive  assurances  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, when in point of fact they  are  being\r\n\r\ncarefully  watched and they are in an embarrassing\r\n\r\nposition.  We have asked for assurances  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that, in the case of civil servants who\r\n\r\nare  not  able  to offer themselves for  voluntary\r\n\r\nservices over the week-ends, nothing will be  done\r\n\r\nto  them and that their promotion or other  rights\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  affected.  We  have  asked  for  an\r\n\r\nassurance and the Prime Minister himself has given\r\n\r\nus  an  assurance to this effect. What  the  civil\r\n\r\nservants are concerned about is that, in spite  of\r\n\r\nthe assurance, and in order to protect their rice-bowl, they feel that they have no alternative  but\r\n\r\nto  offer themselves, not voluntarily, but on  the\r\n\r\npretext  of being voluntary. Although such  people\r\n\r\nare  qualified for promotion, it has  been  feared\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government would give special attention\r\n\r\nto  them. Why I said this, Mr Speaker, is because\r\n\r\nthey  are  constantly plagued with fear  in  their\r\n\r\neveryday livelihood, and the Government should  do\r\n\r\neverything  possible to allay  the  fears  of  the\r\n\r\ncivil  servants in the interests of all the people\r\n\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  it  has been six months  since  we  took\r\n\r\noffice  and  we have arrived at such a Budget.  It\r\n\r\ncan  be said that we have tried our best to  reach\r\n\r\nthis  Budget. Although externally this  Budget  is\r\n\r\nsimilar to that of the previous Government, if  we\r\n\r\nanalyse it carefully, we will see that the content\r\n\r\nis  entirely different. Let us compare our  Budget\r\n\r\nwith the Lim Yew Hock Government's Budget. In  the 1958   Budget,  \r\n\r\nGovernment  expenditure  was  $124\r\n\r\nmillion. This was the greatest expenditure in  the\r\n\r\nhistory  of Singapore. On the contrary,  our  next\r\n\r\nyear's Estimates amount to only $111 million. This\r\n\r\nclearly explains the economic expenditure  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Six months ago we stated our  economic\r\n\r\npolicy.  We  said that we would economise  in  the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  expenditure. We can  now  see  in  our\r\n\r\nBudget for 1960 the amount of our expenditure.  On\r\n\r\nthe   other   hand,  our  proposed  $105   million\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Fund is also the greatest  amount  in\r\n\r\nthe history of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Cairnhill criticised our\r\n\r\nBudget.  We  can excuse others who criticise,  but\r\n\r\nnot  him,  the Member for Cairnhill.  We  have  to\r\n\r\nanswer his criticism because he himself was  still\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister six months ago. He was  rather\r\n\r\nproud  and  happy to say that his 1958 Budget  had\r\n\r\nstill several million dollars remained. But if  we\r\n\r\ninvestigate  it carefully - we would know  that  the\r\n\r\nEstimates  Expenditure for 1958 was  $267  million\r\n\r\nand the Estimates revenue was $271 million - we will\r\n\r\nfind that they have sold Christmas Island for  $20\r\n\r\nmillion.  Therefore, there could  have  been  some\r\n\r\nremainder.  Otherwise we will  find  in  the  1958\r\n\r\nBudget  a deficit of $15.5 million. But our Budget\r\n\r\nis basically different from the previous one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends on the opposite side always quote\r\n\r\nfrom some books. I remember that a few months  ago\r\n\r\nthey  quoted  the Five-Year Plan of  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party.  But  now the  Member  for  Tanglin\r\n\r\nquoted something from Western Germany. But he  has\r\n\r\nforgotten  that Singapore is in the East.  We  are\r\n\r\nalways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproud  to  say that the P.A.P. Government  is  the\r\n\r\nonly  Government that acts on what  it  says.  Our\r\n\r\nBudget is worked out from our Five-Year Plan which\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition considers as their Bible.  Let  us\r\n\r\nsee the financial policy outlined in the Five-Year\r\n\r\nPlan.  If  the  Member for Tanglin will  read  the\r\n\r\nFinancial  Minister's speech on the common  market\r\n\r\nat  page  21  of  the English edition  `The  Tasks\r\n\r\nAhead',  he will see whether that is contradictory\r\n\r\nto  the  promises we had made during the  election\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the development plans between Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation given in the  Budget  speech,\r\n\r\nthey are in line with the promises we gave in  our\r\n\r\nelection campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enterprise and capital investment, that has\r\n\r\nbeen very clearly stated in the Budget speech.  We\r\n\r\npay  special attention to the economic development\r\n\r\nof  our  country. We are trying our best to  solve\r\n\r\nthe  problem of the increase of population. We are\r\n\r\nnot   just   criticising  only.  Apart  from   the\r\n\r\nstatements made in the Budget speech, we have also\r\n\r\ndone  certain things. For instance, last month  we\r\n\r\nin   the  Finance  Ministry  visited  many   local\r\n\r\nfactories.  We have paid attention to the  present\r\n\r\nconditions. From our visit, we have found out that\r\n\r\nthe  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government had  never  before\r\n\r\nvisited these factories. How could they know where\r\n\r\nthe problems lie? Therefore our Budget can be said\r\n\r\nto  be a very proper one. It is agreeable with the\r\n\r\npromises   which  we  gave  during  our   election\r\n\r\ncampaign.  It  is  unlike  those  given   by   the\r\n\r\nOpposition   Members  who,  during  the   election\r\n\r\ncampaign, made promises but when they were elected\r\n\r\nthey forgot what they had said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the announcement of our Budget policy in\r\n\r\nthe  Press,  we  know, from the  response  of  the\r\n\r\npeople, that it is agreeable with the interests of\r\n\r\nthe people of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nin  his speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister  said  that  the  prosperity   of\r\n\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas   been   due   to  the  tension   created   by\r\n\r\ninternational circumstances, and he also said that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  want  to  be  influenced  by  outside\r\n\r\nsources. I am at a loss to understand exactly what\r\n\r\nwas  in  the  mind of the Parliamentary  Secretary\r\n\r\nwhen  he  said it. Could it be that he meant  that\r\n\r\nthe   post-war   prosperity,   and   indeed,   the\r\n\r\npossibility to be able to stay alive in Singapore,\r\n\r\nwas  entirely  due  to tension caused  by  warring\r\n\r\nnations  outside Singapore? If he  meant  that,  I\r\n\r\nwould,  with respect, suggest to him that  he  has\r\n\r\nentirely   misconceived   the   reason   for   the\r\n\r\nprosperity  of  Singapore, and the  reasons  which\r\n\r\nhave  enabled Singapore to prosper. And if by \"but\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  want  to  be  influenced  by  outside\r\n\r\nsources\"  he  means that he does not  want  to  be\r\n\r\ninfluenced  by  political  factors  from   outside\r\n\r\nsources, I entirely agree with him. But if by that\r\n\r\nhe  meant  (and as we are on a discussion  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget, be must, I think, have meant that) that we\r\n\r\ndo not want to be influenced by outside sources in\r\n\r\nso  far as our economy is concerned, it seems that\r\n\r\nin this matter, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister and the Hon. Minister for  Finance\r\n\r\ndo not seem to see eye to eye. If I had understood\r\n\r\nthe  Minister's speech, I understood him  to  mean\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  being what it is, our  prosperity\r\n\r\nand  indeed our economic life is dependent on  our\r\n\r\nneighbours, particularly the Federation of Malaya,\r\n\r\nand secondly, Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that the Parliamentary Secretary\r\n\r\nto  the  Prime Minister had intended to contradict\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Finance on this matter.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nhe  had  political considerations in mind when  he\r\n\r\nsaid that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another subject touched upon by the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  was  Christmas Island.  The  point  and\r\n\r\npurpose of touching upon Christmas Island is  lost\r\n\r\non  me. What does he suggest should have been done\r\n\r\nwith  Christmas  Island? Does he suggest  that  it\r\n\r\nshould  have  been  handed over  by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment to the P.A.P. Government as  a  colony?\r\n\r\nIn  the  events  that  have  since  happened,  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister  had\r\n\r\nbetter thank his stars that that problem was taken\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noff his plate, and that his government has got $20\r\n\r\nmillion to boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also said that the P.A.P. Government has reduced the expenditure of\r\n\r\nGovernment  on every possible head of  expenditure\r\n\r\nit  could  think of. Undoubtedly it has  done.  On\r\n\r\nsome  of  the larger items of expenditure  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  budget,  they  have  done   it   quite\r\n\r\nwell - quite  effectively - by  unilaterally  reducing\r\n\r\ntotal emoluments of Government servants. They have\r\n\r\ndone  that very well. On other matters, they  have\r\n\r\nincreased  expenditure rather than diminished  it.\r\n\r\nThe  cost  of ministerial government, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  has increased and not decreased. And  by  an\r\n\r\nincrease in the cost of ministerial government,  I\r\n\r\nmean   that   the  salaries  paid  to   Ministers,\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Secretaries  to   Ministers,   and\r\n\r\nPolitical  Secretaries to Ministers have increased\r\n\r\nover   those  paid  to  Ministers  and   Assistant\r\n\r\nMinisters in the previous Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis of the budget will indicate that for\r\n\r\nthe previous government, the cost of Ministers was\r\n\r\n$317,000 approximately, whereas the cost under the\r\n\r\npresent  Government is 515,000  approximately.  So\r\n\r\nthat   the  cost,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  is  easily\r\n\r\ndeducible.  The  increase in cost  of  ministerial\r\n\r\ngovernment under the present P.A.P. Government has\r\n\r\ngone well over $190,000. It is not a very big  sum\r\n\r\npossibly,  but when a government goes out  of  its\r\n\r\nway  to  boast that it has cut down on  government\r\n\r\nexpenditure by reducing the personal emoluments of\r\n\r\ncivil servants, then this increase in the cost  of\r\n\r\nministerial government does not exactly seem to be\r\n\r\nin  keeping  with their avowed policy  of  keeping\r\n\r\ndown expenditure on personal emoluments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary then said that in a short time, the Minister for Finance was able to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  somewhat unbalanced  budget  of  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government. Whilst not  for  one  moment\r\n\r\ndetracting from what the Hon. Minister for Finance\r\n\r\ndid to balance the budget, might I say that it was\r\n\r\nnot   an  operation  that  presented  very   great\r\n\r\ndifficulty to a man of the calibre of our Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance? All he had to do\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  arbitrarily to impose cuts on the  salary  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants and to stop expenditure on special\r\n\r\nservices.  It was as simple as that, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nand yet, we are asked to believe by the supporters\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P. Government that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  had  done something quite wonderful,  and\r\n\r\nthat  he  and only he could have done it;  and  in\r\n\r\ntrying to persuade us to believe that it was  only\r\n\r\nhe  who  could have done it, they tell us  what  a\r\n\r\nwonderful economist he is. Let me hasten to assure\r\n\r\nthem  that I am the first to agree with them  that\r\n\r\nhe is a wonderful economist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Government\r\n\r\nhave  done  over  the last six  months,  and  even\r\n\r\nbefore,  and what they intend to do in the  future\r\n\r\nas revealed in the budget which they have proposed\r\n\r\nto  this House. The most important problem that is\r\n\r\nnow   worrying   the  parents  of   Singapore   is\r\n\r\neducation.  The  Ministry of  Education  has  such\r\n\r\nrevolutionary plans for seeking to change the  way\r\n\r\nof  life and the way of thought of the children of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  wish  to  achieve   all   their\r\n\r\nobjectives in the five years they hope  to  be  in\r\n\r\nfor. Mr Speaker, Sir, the objective of being able\r\n\r\nto  understand  one another in a  common  language\r\n\r\nwithout  the difficulty of having interpreters  by\r\n\r\none's  side  to  translate one's fellow  citizens'\r\n\r\nspeech  is a laudable objective, and is one  which\r\n\r\nmust  be achieved in the least possible time.  But\r\n\r\none   must   not  hasten  these  rather  difficult\r\n\r\nprocesses in human development merely because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment wants to attain that objective within a\r\n\r\ngiven  period  of time. No one quarrels  with  the\r\n\r\nGovernment over its education objective,  but  the\r\n\r\nquarrel with the Government is in respect  of  the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which  it seeks to put  forward  these\r\n\r\nexperiments in education, hoping to achieve  their\r\n\r\nobjective  within their term of office. The  first\r\n\r\nthing  the Government did when it came into  power\r\n\r\nwas  to declare that it would have a six-day week.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  it is a good thing. I do not know.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  an  educational expert, Sir. But we  seem  to\r\n\r\nhave  survived  over the years with  the  five-day\r\n\r\nweek.  We  have produced a Prime Minister  of  the\r\n\r\ncalibre of our present one, and we have produced a\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister of the calibre  of  our  present\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance, and I believe they  grew  to\r\n\r\nthis intellectual stature on the five-day week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Might I suggest, with respect to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Education, that the most  important\r\n\r\nthing  for us in Singapore is to develop a Malayan\r\n\r\noutlook?  And  to develop a Malayan outlook,  what\r\n\r\nbetter  way  is  there than  of  putting  all  our\r\n\r\nchildren in one school irrespective of race rather\r\n\r\nthan   do   what   is   now  becoming   known   as\r\n\r\n\"segregation\"  in  schools? I know  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinister  has  vehemently denied  it.  I  am  very\r\n\r\nappreciative of that fact. But the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  are still worried about  what  they\r\n\r\ncall segregation of the races. If the objective is\r\n\r\nfor all of us to be bilingual or trilingual within\r\n\r\nfive  years' time, that in itself is an  objective\r\n\r\nworthy of attainment, Mr Speaker. But I put it to\r\n\r\nthe  Education Minister that even more  worthy  of\r\n\r\nattainment  is  a Malayan outlook.  Anything  that\r\n\r\nwill  detract  from  the  creation  of  a  Malayan\r\n\r\noutlook  is something which the Government  should\r\n\r\ndiscourage.  And  I  am telling  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  that  this  so-called  taking  away  of\r\n\r\nIndian  boys  and Malay boys and putting  them  in\r\n\r\ncertain   schools,  merely  because  the  teaching\r\n\r\nsituation  is difficult and it might  add  to  the\r\n\r\ncosts  of Government, is, in my opinion, a  policy\r\n\r\nwhich  will not pay this country in the long  run.\r\n\r\nIf  it is going to cost the Government more,  well\r\n\r\nthen  let it cost the Government more because  the\r\n\r\nmain objective should be to build a common Malayan\r\n\r\noutlook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading Education on page 152 of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Annual Report for 1958 certain  figures\r\n\r\nare  given  which  show that  so  far  as  English\r\n\r\nschools are concerned, there were 99,000 pupils in\r\n\r\nGovernment schools and 33,482 pupils in Government-aided  schools,  making a total of  about  120,000\r\n\r\npupils  in  all Government schools. In  a  further\r\n\r\nsection  on  page 145, there is a statement  which\r\n\r\nsays  that  in 1958, there were 14,719  candidates\r\n\r\nfor    the    entrance   examination   of    which\r\n\r\napproximately  750 were from Malay  schools.  From\r\n\r\nthat, it appears to me, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the\r\n\r\npercentage of pupils in secondary schools is about\r\n\r\n10  to 11 per cent of the total student population\r\n\r\nin   Government   and   Government-aided   English\r\n\r\nschools. So that 90 per cent of our children,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, go to primary schools and the  other\r\n\r\n10 per cent find themselves in secondary schools.\r\n\r\nMay  I  put  a  proposition  to  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation for consideration? I understand that the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the six-day week, Mr Speaker, has\r\n\r\nnot added very much to the actual amount of school\r\n\r\nhours  in  school  so far as primary  schools  are\r\n\r\nconcerned. It is negligible. The five-day week and\r\n\r\nthe six-day week provide the same number of school\r\n\r\nhours for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  primary  schools. Would not the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation consider introducing only a six-day week\r\n\r\nfor  secondary schools and stop the  six-day  week\r\n\r\nfor  the  primary  schools? This would  release  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of teachers, and Saturdays would  be  free\r\n\r\nfor  the  primary schools, and could not Saturdays\r\n\r\nbe  utilised  for the purpose of language  tuition\r\n\r\nfor  the  primary schools? I understand  that  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty confronting the Ministry is the lack of\r\n\r\nteachers  in  Malay,  and  in  Tamil  and  Chinese\r\n\r\npossibly.  Now, instead of taking the children  to\r\n\r\nthe  teachers, could not the teachers be taken  to\r\n\r\nthe  children? Could not the teachers be  provided\r\n\r\nwith  some form of transport to go from school  to\r\n\r\nschool and there teach Tamil or Malay as the  case\r\n\r\nmay be, rather than to dragoon all Malay and Tamil\r\n\r\nschool  children into some schools merely  to  cut\r\n\r\ndown  the  cost in education? These are  thoughts,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, which have passed through my mind and\r\n\r\nwhich  I  place before the Hon, the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation for his consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Kandasamy) in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next item that concerns the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore   is   the  question  of  housing.   The\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates provide a sum of $25 million\r\n\r\nfor  the Ministry of National Development for  the\r\n\r\nerection of houses. We have not heard what exactly\r\n\r\nthe  plans  are and how the Minister for  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  hopes  to utilise  this  $25  million\r\n\r\nduring  the space of 12 short months. We had  also\r\n\r\nbeen  promised a lot of houses for the year  1959.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can make out, not one housing unit has\r\n\r\nbeen   completed  by  the  Trust.   The   question\r\n\r\ntherefore pertinently arises, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nwill  the Ministry of National Development be able\r\n\r\nfully  to utilise this $25 million which has  been\r\n\r\nallocated  to  that Ministry, or is  it  merely  a\r\n\r\npaper   vote   which,  owing  to  the   conditions\r\n\r\nprevailing in the Singapore Improvement Trust, the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance knows that the Trust  cannot\r\n\r\nfulfil?  I  understand there are no architects  in\r\n\r\nthe Trust, or such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\narchitects  as there are have so little experience\r\n\r\nin  building, that they do not know which  way  to\r\n\r\nsite buildings - east, west, left or centre. If that\r\n\r\nis  the  position  in  the  Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust,  can  they  utilise  the  $25  million?  We\r\n\r\nunderstand that one housing unit is going to  cost\r\n\r\n$4,000.  That means the Ministry will  erect  well\r\n\r\nover  6,000 housing units during 1960.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  what  plans have been laid now, whether  the\r\n\r\nsites have been earmarked, whether contracts  have\r\n\r\nbeen let out, whether plans have been put on paper\r\n\r\nand  contracts have been signed. If none of  these\r\n\r\nhas   been  done,  I  am  suggesting,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, that building operations cannot start  on\r\n\r\nthe  site for another four to five months and that\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance will, at the end of 1960,\r\n\r\nfind himself with, instead of a deficit budget,  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  budget. And this will not be through  any\r\n\r\nstroke of genius on his part, not this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the other factor - if you want to build\r\n\r\nhouses,  not  only  must you have  architects  and\r\n\r\nengineers, but you must also have a building trade\r\n\r\nfit,  ready and willing to receive the grand plans\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister  for Housing. I  understand  the\r\n\r\nbuilding trade in Singapore is in the doldrums and\r\n\r\nthe  builders are slowly but surely trekking their\r\n\r\nway up to the Federation where there is a building\r\n\r\nboom. And if the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\ndoes not hurry on with his plans, he will not have\r\n\r\nthe builders or the workers to construct them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Government can hope to provide a sufficiency\r\n\r\nof  houses for everyone in Singapore, and for that\r\n\r\nreason  it  is  vital  that  Government  encourage\r\n\r\nbuilding also on the private sector. What has  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government done to encourage  this?  Since\r\n\r\nDecember 1957, the Mayor of the City Council - he is\r\n\r\nnow   with   us  as  the  Minister  for   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment - did everything possible  not  only  to\r\n\r\ndiscourage but to kill private enterprise  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector of building. The Mayor was  unable\r\n\r\nto appreciate that revenue from assessments is the\r\n\r\nbackbone  of  municipal finance, and that  if  you\r\n\r\nkill the building trade and private building,  you\r\n\r\ndestroy municipal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfinance. If there is one thing in respect of which\r\n\r\nthe   Mayor  will  go  down  in  the  history   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  he will certainly go down as  the  one\r\n\r\nwho most effectively destroyed the main sinews  of\r\n\r\nmunicipal finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like\r\n\r\nto  touch  on  is  the  professional  services  in\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Finance Minister  in  his  speech\r\n\r\nsaid that he was offering allowances staggered  in\r\n\r\nthree  categories - $100, $200 and  $300.  $100  for\r\n\r\nprofessional and technical people with under seven\r\n\r\nyears'  experience;  $200  for  professional   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  people of over seven years' experience;\r\n\r\nand  $300  for those who give the Government  true\r\n\r\nand  faithful service. Whether this only  includes\r\n\r\n(this  faithful category, I mean) the  technicians\r\n\r\nand  professional men, the Minister did  not  make\r\n\r\nquite  clear. Or whether he wanted to take  within\r\n\r\nhis  embrace  the  whole of the Civil  Service  by\r\n\r\noffering the $300 bounty to all the civil servants\r\n\r\nwho  are  good,  true, loyal and work  hard,  even\r\n\r\nperhaps on Sundays, that was not made quite clear.\r\n\r\nPerhaps  the  Minister might clarify  that  point.\r\n\r\nNow, I wonder what the Minister for Labour and Law\r\n\r\nhas  to  say on a matter like that. What reactions\r\n\r\nwill  a  genuine trade union movement have to  the\r\n\r\noffer by an employer to his employees who work  so\r\n\r\nhard  that the employer of his own free will gives\r\n\r\n$300  each?  I  have always understood  from  good\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists that this is one of the  ways  in\r\n\r\nwhich  employers seek to split trade unionists.  I\r\n\r\nam sure the Minister for Finance-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is an incentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> These are incentives. Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  I  am  grateful  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance - these  are incentives to break  wide  open\r\n\r\nthe trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No. It is to encourage good unionists!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Do you remember in the bad old days\r\n\r\nwhen  posts  carried \"Allowances, Special  to  the\r\n\r\nHolder\" - that. I believe, was the technical term in\r\n\r\nthe bad old days. The unions fought against it. Oh\r\n\r\nyes, they fought tooth and nail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey  said,  \"The post must be paid  according  to\r\n\r\nwhat  it is worth.\" \"Special to the Holder\" merely\r\n\r\nmeans  the blue-eyed boy gets everything  and  the\r\n\r\nrest  get nothing. Does the Finance Minister  want\r\n\r\nto do a thing like that? I am sure he does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We will cut out the $300.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On the question of income tax. I am\r\n\r\nsomewhat  disappointed with the cursory  statement\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister for Finance that there  was  tax\r\n\r\nevasion  and that he was going to tighten  up  the\r\n\r\ntax  machinery in order that it might  effectively\r\n\r\ncollect more. I think it is public knowledge,  Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, that there has been tax evasion on\r\n\r\na  mass  scale in Singapore, if I may put it  that\r\n\r\nway,  with  the result that a lot of  people,  who\r\n\r\nshould  be  paying  taxes and thus  pulling  their\r\n\r\nfinancial  weight  behind  the  State,  have  been\r\n\r\nevading it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have with me, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Hansard\r\n\r\nof  13th  December,  1957. This  is  the  official\r\n\r\nreport on the 1958 Budget; col. 2921. Mr Lee Kuan\r\n\r\nYew,  who  was then the Member for Tanjong  Pagar,\r\n\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"We are just indicating, Mr Speaker, Sir, as a\r\n\r\nmatter  of general government policy that  if  and\r\n\r\nwhen the P.A.P. runs this government, we shall see\r\n\r\nthat the Income Tax Department does its duty.  The\r\n\r\nway  to  do  it  is  the way it  is  done  in  all\r\n\r\ncivilized  countries.  If  you  think   that   Mr\r\n\r\nGoldsmith  has  not  been  paying  his  tax,  then\r\n\r\njudging from the number of cars and the number  of\r\n\r\ndiamond solitaires his wife exhibits, you just put\r\n\r\nin  an estimate of what you think he ought to  pay\r\n\r\nand  let him disprove it. If he pays it, next year\r\n\r\ndouble the estimate; then let him disprove it.  If\r\n\r\nhe pays again, quadruple it, and so we go on until\r\n\r\nwe  make everybody in the community pay their fair\r\n\r\nshare   of  taxation  or  become  barrow-boys   or\r\n\r\nhawkers, in which case they do not have to pay any\r\n\r\ntaxes  at  all. It might well be, as a  result  of\r\n\r\njust  rounding off this computation, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  at 12,300 employers, as I said, on the  mean\r\n\r\naverage of $50,000 chargeable profits, that  ought\r\n\r\nto   bring   $8,630  per  employer,  which   means\r\n\r\n$106,149,000 per year just from employers alone. I\r\n\r\ncould develop this argument, and I will, all about\r\n\r\nthis  property tax both in the city area  and  the\r\n\r\nRural  Board. But a conservative estimate of  what\r\n\r\ncould  be  collected on present rates is somewhere\r\n\r\nin  the region of $128 million per year; in  other\r\n\r\nwords,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndouble  what  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary\r\n\r\nestimates  for  next  year.  The  tragedy  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  this, that although  this  is  what\r\n\r\nshould be the case, whatever Government comes into\r\n\r\npower  next year it will be saddled with the  same\r\n\r\napparatus with which to extract the tax. Unless we\r\n\r\nhave a ruthless Minister for Finance who will deal\r\n\r\nwith  inept  and bureaucratic civil  servants  and\r\n\r\nwill  improve  the  running of  the  machinery  of\r\n\r\nstate, we will be back in the same position.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know what \"the\r\n\r\nsame position\" means, but if the collection of the\r\n\r\nsame  amount of tax must necessarily indicate  the\r\n\r\nsame  position, then we are in \"the same position\"\r\n\r\ntoday  as  when the Member for Tanjong Pagar,  who\r\n\r\nhappily  is now the Prime Minister, addressed  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  on the 1958 Budget. So that if  one  can\r\n\r\nplace  any weight on the speech of the Member  for\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar - and I am not the one to say that  no\r\n\r\none  should not - then I think the position is  that\r\n\r\neven  today, with drastic measures, the  provision\r\n\r\nof  $65 million by way of income tax for the  year\r\n\r\n1960  is certainly inadequate and very much  below\r\n\r\nthe  paying capacity of the tax-paying  public  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. Whether we have a ruthless Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance,  I do not know, but he certainly  is  not\r\n\r\nlacking in courage - that we know. Therefore, he  is\r\n\r\nthe  man  for  the job and we hope that  when  the\r\n\r\nfinal  accounts  for the year  1960  are  written,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  an amount of $65 million  by  way  of\r\n\r\nincome tax we shall have $120 million collected in\r\n\r\nthe  way  of income tax, which will mean then,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  instead of a $6 million deficit we  shall\r\n\r\nhave  a  surplus  budget of $60 million;  and  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government will have found all the  monies\r\n\r\nthey  want  for all the development projects  over\r\n\r\nthe next four years or so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, turning to the Medical Services. I remember\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Health, whilst making a statement\r\n\r\nto   the   Press - I  wonder  if  it  was  correctly\r\n\r\nreported, but this is what I read - that so  far  as\r\n\r\nthe  doctors  were concerned, he was not  worried,\r\n\r\nthey  could  go.  But  he was  worried  about  his\r\n\r\nnurses! He was wondering whether his nurses  would\r\n\r\nstay with him, but if the doctors were to go,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"let them go; so long as I have my nurses.\" Within\r\n\r\nsix  months  of that report \"we expanded  so  much\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  now  going  abroad  to  recruit  60\r\n\r\ndoctors.\" That seems to be an appropriate  comment\r\n\r\non  the  Minister's references to the Press  about\r\n\r\nhis  Medical Services. Quite frankly,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  we are not running a government  service\r\n\r\ncomposed  of morons or donkeys. We are  running  a\r\n\r\ngovernment  service composed of human beings,  and\r\n\r\nif you treat them like human beings they will give\r\n\r\nyou  good,  true, honest, efficient  service  like\r\n\r\nhuman  beings. What the doctors are worried  about\r\n\r\nis  not so much that they are being called upon to\r\n\r\ndo the work that two doctors should be doing. Most\r\n\r\nof  them  are doing it now, and most of  them  are\r\n\r\ndoing it willingly. But what they object to is the\r\n\r\nmanner  in  which they are being pushed around  by\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry   and   its   officials,   and   no\r\n\r\nappreciation is given them for the amount of  hard\r\n\r\nwork,  long hours, and no holidays which they  are\r\n\r\nnow  doing. If the Government could only treat its\r\n\r\nservants  as  human  beings, they  will  get  much\r\n\r\nbetter results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the development programme\r\n\r\nenvisaged  by this Government, as set out  in  the\r\n\r\nBudget,  a  close  inspection of  it,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  seems  to indicate - to me  at  least - that\r\n\r\nvery  little  is  going to be done.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects  are  subject  to  financial\r\n\r\ncontrol  and by that I understand it to mean  that\r\n\r\nno  plans have yet been formulated, and when  they\r\n\r\nare  formulated, it will be subject  to  the  most\r\n\r\nagonising  scrutiny by the Minister  for  Finance;\r\n\r\nand by the time the Estimates have got through the\r\n\r\nagonising  scrutiny of the Minister  for  Finance,\r\n\r\nthe year might be over. So we end up in this happy\r\n\r\nposition - that if the Minister for Finance, who  it\r\n\r\nis  suggested should be ruthless in his income tax\r\n\r\ncollections, does in fact get ruthless and rake in\r\n\r\nanother   $60   million  and  if  the  development\r\n\r\nprojects  have not been advanced further over  the\r\n\r\nnext  six  months  than they are  today,  the  $60\r\n\r\nmillion estimated to be spent on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  projects will not be  spent,  and  we\r\n\r\nshall end up our final accounts for the year  1960\r\n\r\nwith a $150 million surplus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.55 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, may I\r\n\r\nstart   by  quoting  a  very  well-known   Chinese\r\n\r\nproverb,  which  is  Tsuo  ma  k'an  hua,  meaning\r\n\r\n\"Riding  on  horses and looking at  flowers\"?  The\r\n\r\nBudget  is an extremely complicated piece of  work\r\n\r\non  which  several  minds  have  been  turned  for\r\n\r\nseveral months. For the Opposition to stand up and\r\n\r\nin a few minutes blast it to smithereens, shows  I\r\n\r\nthink  a  tendency to be superficial and  just  to\r\n\r\ndenigrate whatever effort the Government is trying\r\n\r\nto  make with the limited financial means  at  its\r\n\r\ndisposal.  It  is fortunate that the  P.A.P. came\r\n\r\ninto  power  at  the end of May last,  because  we\r\n\r\nfound  very soon that there was going to be a  $14\r\n\r\nmillion deficit for 1959. Quite rightly, when  you\r\n\r\nare  faced with empty coffers, the important thing\r\n\r\nto do is to tighten your belts - pay cuts have to be\r\n\r\nimposed  and all of us shared in them. It  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause we did not wish to consult anybody or that\r\n\r\nwe  were  arbitrary in our action, but a firm  and\r\n\r\nquick decision had to be made before the situation\r\n\r\ndeteriorated. And I would say that the industry at\r\n\r\nlarge appreciates this action - that we are honestly\r\n\r\ntrying to balance our budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also discovered that the reserves had fallen\r\n\r\nfrom  $320  million to $87 million  in  the  short\r\n\r\nspace  of  five  years. What did  the  old  S.P.A.\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  to stop the running  down  of  the\r\n\r\nreserves?  They  sold  Christmas  Island   for   a\r\n\r\nsong - $20 million to be exact. In 1957 the  revenue\r\n\r\nexpected  from Christmas Island was $1.2  million.\r\n\r\nThey  have  a further lease for 32 years  and,  on\r\n\r\nthat  estimate, would have earned us an  estimated\r\n\r\n$38.4 million. Instead, the old government sold it\r\n\r\nfor $20 million - half that price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park brought an attack on\r\n\r\nthe   Parliamentary   Secretary   to   the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister - that  he has no argument for  talking  on\r\n\r\nChristmas Island - and suggested that we would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant to colonise Christmas Island. But may I quote\r\n\r\nhere what has been said by the last Government  on\r\n\r\nChristmas Island:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"No useful purpose would be served by a Minister\r\n\r\nvisiting,  apart  from  the  practical  difficulty\r\n\r\ngetting there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>that is Christmas Island:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"...and back. The Island clearly cannot be\r\n\r\npart of a self-governing Singapore and it would be\r\n\r\nwrong  to let the inhabitants think that they  are\r\n\r\nin a position to reopen H.M.G.'s decision.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who are the inhabitants, Mr Deputy Speaker?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants are 1,810 Chinese, 489 Malaysians, 9 Indians, 136 Europeans, making a total of 2,444. That was the census, Mr Deputy Speaker, in 1956.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, when the P.A.P. Government found that financially we were faced with a\r\n\r\ncritical situation, we did the right thing. It was\r\n\r\nlucky  that  we came in time, otherwise  we  would\r\n\r\nhave  found that the S.P.A. Government would  have\r\n\r\nsold Singapore to somebody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But may I reply to the Member for Mountbatten who\r\n\r\nhas  shown  her  interest in aeroplanes?  She  has\r\n\r\nasked  us  for  the  Government  policy  on  the\r\n\r\nAirport.  Here  I  would like to  state  that  the\r\n\r\npresent potential capacity of our single runway is\r\n\r\nfar greater than the existing traffic. The Airport\r\n\r\nis  estimated to lose $2.8 million in 1960, and it\r\n\r\nhas  been regularly losing about $2 million  every\r\n\r\nyear.  Let  us  remember,  before  we  talk  about\r\n\r\nextending  the  runway, that there are  altogether\r\n\r\nfour  aerodromes in a little island of 220  square\r\n\r\nmiles - three  military airports at Changi,  Seletar\r\n\r\nand  Tengah, and one civil airport. Extending  an\r\n\r\nairport  would  mean  displacing  people  who  are\r\n\r\nliving in that area. Extending your airport is not\r\n\r\nin any way going to increase your revenue. What is\r\n\r\nimportant   is  that  more  aircraft   should   be\r\n\r\npermitted   to  use  the  Airport.  More   airline\r\n\r\noperators  should be allowed to use  the  Airport.\r\n\r\nOnly  in this way can we increase our landing fees\r\n\r\nand, therefore, help to cover the expenses paid to\r\n\r\nthe Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment the Government is not in a position\r\n\r\nto  control  any air traffic rights in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThat  is because, from my understanding of letters\r\n\r\nexchanged,  the  old Government  had  agreed  that\r\n\r\ncivil  aviation comes under foreign  affairs,  and\r\n\r\nthat  being  so, it is in the hands of the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom.  That  is all I wish to say,  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Miss Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Miss Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker, first of all, I want to reply  to\r\n\r\nthe  two respectable Opposition Member - the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill and the Member for Farrer Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said that the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment had during the past few months  sacked\r\n\r\nmany  engineers. Mr Speaker, many engineers  have\r\n\r\nresigned. We can tell them directly that under the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government, and also when we were  in  the\r\n\r\nCity  Council,  we  want an efficient  Government.\r\n\r\nWhen  we were in the City Council and when we  saw\r\n\r\nthem  working  in our departments,  the  engineers\r\n\r\nwere  irresponsible  and  did  not  work  for  the\r\n\r\npeople.  At  the  time when we were  in  the  City\r\n\r\nCouncil,  we carried out a revolutionary  project,\r\n\r\nand  that is how to make those engineers work well\r\n\r\nand  effectively  and  with  responsibility.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, our project was frustrated  by  the\r\n\r\nOpposition. Today the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government is supported and elected by  the\r\n\r\npeople.  I  can tell you why during the  past  six\r\n\r\nmonths  many  engineers  have  resigned  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development. There are  many\r\n\r\nengineers who had not been sacked. They  had  gone\r\n\r\nto  foreign countries by air and they had  sent  a\r\n\r\nletter saying that they were going to resign. They\r\n\r\nhad  their  motives. Now we can tell you  why  the\r\n\r\nengineers  in the Ministry of National Development\r\n\r\nhad   resigned.  We  have  recruited  many   local\r\n\r\nengineers,  because  we have  full  confidence  in\r\n\r\nlocal  engineers.  They  are  able  to  work  with\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  Today  with  the  P.A.P. in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   National  Development,   we   have\r\n\r\ncompleted  a  lot  of  work during  the  past  six\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding our 1960 Budget, the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten has said that the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment did not build any houses.  There  were\r\n\r\nno  projects like those in Kuala Lumpur. She  must\r\n\r\nrealise  that the reason why there is  development\r\n\r\nin Kuala Lumpur is because they are going to build\r\n\r\na  capital. They must build a capital city  there.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore at present we must take care of  the\r\n\r\ninterest   of  the  people - the  people's   housing\r\n\r\nproblem. The Member for Farrer Park said  that  he\r\n\r\ndoes not know what we can do within a period of 12\r\n\r\nmonths. But strangely enough we have taken  office\r\n\r\nfor  only  six  months,  and  not  twelve  months.\r\n\r\nWhether it is six months or twelve months our work\r\n\r\nwill   be   completed.  That  we  will  tell   the\r\n\r\nOpposition Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much improvement in the reorganisation of the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development and  S.I.T. has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  during the past six  months.  The  old\r\n\r\nS.I.T. complaints  of  corruption  against   the\r\n\r\nallocation of flats, the passing of plans and  the\r\n\r\nconstruction of S.I.T. houses plus the transfer of\r\n\r\nT.O.L.s  or State reverted properties are  now  no\r\n\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 1,800 houses of more than 99 years\r\n\r\nlease belonging to the Government. They have  been\r\n\r\na source of much corruption. Work has been started\r\n\r\nto  reorganise  these  2,000 units  of  Government\r\n\r\nState reverted houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the Rent Conciliation Board is\r\n\r\nbeing  reconstituted to represent  more  equitably\r\n\r\nthe  interests of the poor tenants.  The  previous\r\n\r\nBoard  was  mostly  composed  of  members  of  the\r\n\r\nLandlord class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office is undergoing a thorough\r\n\r\nreorganisation and a study is now being made of  a\r\n\r\nrevision  of our land policies so that the  little\r\n\r\nland  available to us in Singapore would  be  made\r\n\r\nuse of to the maximum advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the S.I.T. was reorganised we started\r\n\r\non  building  for  the two fire sites  namely  the\r\n\r\nKampong  Tiong Bahru and Kampong Koo  Chye  sites.\r\n\r\nWork  would  be completed very soon and  with  the\r\n\r\nfinance  available to the S.I.T. in  1959  we  are\r\n\r\nembarking on the use of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall  available funds we have to build  up  another\r\n\r\n2,000  units  of flats in the Kampong Tiong  Bahru\r\n\r\nfire  site. This will be the first time  that  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. is building really low cost housing and the\r\n\r\nrent  of these flats would be within the means  of\r\n\r\nthe  lower income groups. Next year, when the  $25\r\n\r\nmillion is made available to the Housing Authority\r\n\r\nwe  hope  that with the checks in corruption,  the\r\n\r\ndrafting  of  plans on a rational  basis  and  the\r\n\r\nuseful  employment of local architects instead  of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  architects we can  build  about  8,000\r\n\r\nunits  of  flats. $25 million if used by  the  old\r\n\r\nS.I.T. would only build 4,000 units of flats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corruption in the passing of plans was well known\r\n\r\nand  since  the  S.I.T. was reorganised  all  such\r\n\r\nallegations have stopped. The passing of plans  is\r\n\r\nmost  susceptible to temptations of corruption  by\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  people  who  can  make  millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars from the passing of plans each year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, today is the first\r\n\r\nday  in  the history of Singapore when a programme\r\n\r\nconcerning  the  economic  policy  framed   by   a\r\n\r\npeople's government is being discussed. In opening\r\n\r\nthe  debate, the Member for Cairnhill  said  that,\r\n\r\nafter   hearing   and  reading  the   Government's\r\n\r\nfinancial  policy for 1960, there was nothing  for\r\n\r\nthe  present Government to crow about.  Admittedly\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government does not make it its policy\r\n\r\nto  crow,  because we do not wish to be  the  cock\r\n\r\nthat  crows.  It  is the hen that lays  the  eggs.\r\n\r\nIndirectly  the Member said that, from the  speech\r\n\r\nmade  by the Minister for Finance, it was apparent\r\n\r\nthat  there was a split in the Party hierarchy.  I\r\n\r\nthink this is irrelevant and, in point of fact, it\r\n\r\nis  only  people  who suffer from  nightmares  and\r\n\r\npeople  who  are faced with a split in  their  own\r\n\r\nparty who are themselves full of wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nForeign capital, he said, has no confidence in the\r\n\r\npresent  Government.  This is  most  unreasonable,\r\n\r\nbecause  Singapore  has  now  become  one  of  the\r\n\r\nbiggest and busiest harbours in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Members from the Opposition made a hue\r\n\r\nand  cry  about  the  reduction  of  the  variable\r\n\r\nallowances  and  they have accused  Government  of\r\n\r\nbeing  dictatorial and that no opportunity and  no\r\n\r\nmercy were shown to the civil servants. This is  a\r\n\r\nwild  accusation which was made  in  a  moment  of\r\n\r\nemotion and sentiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan in his speech\r\n\r\ntouched   on   the  preamble  contained   in   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Singapore. I think I am quite sure\r\n\r\nthe  Member had in mind the special privileges for\r\n\r\nthe   Malays  as  the  indigenous  people  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  He also touched on the appointments  for\r\n\r\n1960  about which no specific mention was made  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance. He also mentioned  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development  Board.  Again  the   Member\r\n\r\nwarned  that if in this matter the Government  has\r\n\r\nno  specific policy, then U.M.N.O. will  determine\r\n\r\nthe shape of the government in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the election, there were people who were\r\n\r\nprepared  to tear down manifestos in the  presence\r\n\r\nof   huge   crowds.  Actually,  as  the   people's\r\n\r\ngovernment, we are fully conscious of the fate  of\r\n\r\nthe neglected and the downtrodden in this country.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our  responsibility to  help  raise  their\r\n\r\nstandard  of  living,  whether  they  are  Malays,\r\n\r\nChinese  or Indians. Today, we had the opportunity\r\n\r\nto  receive a course on economics from a Member of\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition who produced various booklets  and\r\n\r\nmade  the  accusation that the  P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nworked  subject to capitalist interest and to  the\r\n\r\nparty interest - that is to say, that at one time it\r\n\r\nis  for  the  left and at another it  is  for  the\r\n\r\nright. It is fortunate the Member did not say that\r\n\r\nthe    P.A.P.   Government   worked   for    three\r\n\r\ninterests - party interest, capitalist interest  and\r\n\r\nalso   self-interest.  If  the  P.A.P.  Government\r\n\r\nsupport the demands of the people and, at the same\r\n\r\ntime,  respect  the interests of the  capitalists,\r\n\r\nthis  is  because we should know the situation  in\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore is placed. It is lacking  in  raw\r\n\r\nmaterials  and  dependent mainly on its  entrep\ufffdt.\r\n\r\nBut  what we oppose are the capitalist groups  who\r\n\r\noppress  the downtrodden. We do not wish to  adopt\r\n\r\nthe attitude of taking away one man's\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncredit  and  depriving him of it. The  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin also said that social democracy, which  is\r\n\r\nbeing   carried  out  by  the  P.A.P.  Government,\r\n\r\ndiffers   from  that  in  England.  Yes,   it   is\r\n\r\ndifferent. Because the circumstances between those\r\n\r\nobtaining  in  England and those in Singapore  are\r\n\r\ndifferent. He also suggested that we should follow\r\n\r\nthe  examples  of the economic policy  pursued  by\r\n\r\nWestern  Germany.  I do not know  which  socialist\r\n\r\nideology  he follows, whether it is that  of  West\r\n\r\nGermany  or  of  England. I think putting  forward\r\n\r\ntheories is an easy matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You buy at one cent, sell at three cents and you\r\n\r\ncan  make  a profit of two cents. But the position\r\n\r\nof  the buying public must be considered. Just  by\r\n\r\nputting forward theories I think if the Member for\r\n\r\nTanglin  becomes  the Minister  for  Finance,  the\r\n\r\neconomic position will change every other day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Southern Islands, I would like\r\n\r\nto  stress  that it is the responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nOpposition  to  criticise. As for  his  accusation\r\n\r\nthat the P.A.P. Government has claimed that it  is\r\n\r\nthe  only sincere party, we have not made  such  a\r\n\r\nclaim. But we have said that we are the only party\r\n\r\nwhich can carry out its pledges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worry and the fear that money is being spent\r\n\r\nwastefully  is unfounded. We will not  betray  the\r\n\r\ntrust  of  the people. As an example, mention  was\r\n\r\nmade  of  the  Minister  for National  Development\r\n\r\nrecruiting workers without consulting the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour and Law. I think what is being done  is\r\n\r\nbetter  than  what had been done by  the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Against the P.A.P. Government,  there\r\n\r\nwas   also   the  accusation  that  if   you   are\r\n\r\nunemployed, in order to get a job you have to be a\r\n\r\nmember  of the P.A.P. This is not true.  If  there\r\n\r\nare  P.A.P. members in the squad, what of it?  The\r\n\r\nMinister  for  National Development  has  admitted\r\n\r\nopenly that there are P.A.P. members in the squad.\r\n\r\nIt  is not true to say that as it is the Party  in\r\n\r\npower, all the top posts are being held by P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers.

Concerning the promise  to\r\n\r\nraise  the  standard of living of those  who  were\r\n\r\nneglected by the past government, it is true  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is giving serious consideration  to\r\n\r\nthis matter. They do not make promises every other\r\n\r\nday, but once we make a promise, we will see to it\r\n\r\nthat it is carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to promotion, which is a matter of\r\n\r\nconcern  to  the  Member for Southern  Islands,  I\r\n\r\nthink the civil servants should realise that  they\r\n\r\nneed  not  have any doubt in their minds that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government is constantly paying  attention\r\n\r\nto  the safety and interest of the civil servants.\r\n\r\nAnd we hope that they will not work only when they\r\n\r\nare  asked to. Mr Speaker, I think all the  other\r\n\r\ncharges  will be answered by my colleagues.

Dr Gwee Ah  Leng's\r\n\r\nReport  was  handed to me on 20th of November - just\r\n\r\nthree   weeks  ago.  The  Report  is   now   under\r\n\r\nconsideration  by  the  Government  and  will   be\r\n\r\npublished after due consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware of the anxiety of the people over\r\n\r\nNanyang University and the graduates who are  soon\r\n\r\nto  be  produced. The Prime Minister  himself  has\r\n\r\nalready  announced  the fact  that  the  Education\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  be employing at least  50  of  the\r\n\r\ngraduates  from Nanyang University  for  the  next\r\n\r\nyear  subject  to selection by the Public  Service\r\n\r\nCommission. While on this subject, it is pertinent\r\n\r\nto  ask  what  has  happened to the  so-called  $5\r\n\r\nmillion  that was promised by the last Government.\r\n\r\nIt was stated publicly and it was published in the\r\n\r\nPress,  under  the name of Mr Tan Lark  Sye  some\r\n\r\nweeks  ago,  that  the  last  Deputy  Speaker  had\r\n\r\nsuggested  this  $5 million grant  which  had  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the former Chief Minister, Mr Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock, and his colleagues. Since there had been  no\r\n\r\npublic  denial, we can only say that wild promises\r\n\r\nhad  been made by responsible members of the  last\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  they  have run  away  from  those\r\n\r\npromises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if it had been a case of breach of promise I think it would have gone to court and\r\n\r\nserious penalties would have been imposed. So  you\r\n\r\ncan see for yourselves the type of politicians who\r\n\r\nmade wild promises and who ran away from them when\r\n\r\nthe  time  of  reckoning came. Even at  this  very\r\n\r\nmoment,  they  are not present  to  listen  to  my\r\n\r\nreply.  There  is talk of development  of  schools\r\n\r\nwhich  the former Minister for Education was proud\r\n\r\nto talk about. Yes, we see wasteful expenditure of\r\n\r\nGovernment money in that there are parquet  floors\r\n\r\nin science laboratories; parquet floors for school\r\n\r\nhalls. I suppose the former Minister for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation  and now Member for Cairnhill  is  very\r\n\r\ninterested in dancing so that all these facilities\r\n\r\nare available. We are not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must go on now to answer the Member for Farrer\r\n\r\nPark,  when he said that we are attempting  to  do\r\n\r\ntoo  much  in  too short a time. Mr Speaker,  the\r\n\r\nproblems   facing  this  country,  especially   in\r\n\r\nrespect  of trying to bring about unity out  of  a\r\n\r\ndiversity  of four educational streams which  have\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in four different ways, and  trying  to\r\n\r\nintegrate them into one to form the basis  of  the\r\n\r\nfuture nation of Singapore, do not permit of  lazy\r\n\r\nor usual methods of solution. We must have courage\r\n\r\nif  we want to build a nation. We must be prepared\r\n\r\nto  experiment. If we fear to experiment, we might\r\n\r\nas well turn the clock back and choose to be under\r\n\r\ncolonial government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park brings up the subject\r\n\r\nof  the six-day week. Little does he realise  that\r\n\r\none-half of education in Singapore comes under the\r\n\r\nChinese stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the Member for Farrer Park is back,\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am answering his queries. One-half  of\r\n\r\nthe educational system in Singapore is the Chinese\r\n\r\nstream. Because of his fears of a six-day week, he\r\n\r\nseems  to  be oblivious of the fact that there  is\r\n\r\nsuch  a  thing  as  a Chinese stream  existing  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Does  he  realise  that  in  both  the\r\n\r\nelementary  and secondary schools in  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nstream, a six-day week is common and normal?  They\r\n\r\nhave had it, but of course it was not quite a full\r\n\r\nsix-day  week. They used to stop their classes  at\r\n\r\n11  on Saturday mornings. Only the English schools\r\n\r\nwhich  were accustomed to a five-day week regarded\r\n\r\nthe six-day week as an extra day of hard labour!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member then talked about a Malayan outlook.\r\n\r\nSurely  that  is  the  last thing  that  he  could\r\n\r\npossibly   level   against  the  People's   Action\r\n\r\nParty - that  we  do  not know  what  is  a  Malayan\r\n\r\noutlook, and how we are to proceed about  it.  His\r\n\r\nsuggestion, which was for a five-day week, but  to\r\n\r\nallow  the  sixth  day to be taken  up  with  pure\r\n\r\nlanguage teaching, is very simple to put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  surely it is not beyond his comprehension  to\r\n\r\nrealise that you do not learn languages one day in\r\n\r\na  week.  Language is taught day in and  day  out,\r\n\r\nhour  after hour, before it gets right  into  your\r\n\r\nsystem.   Only  then  can  language  be  part   of\r\n\r\nyourself!  It is necessary, therefore, that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  adequate language teaching  facilities\r\n\r\nduring  the  course of the week and  for  so  many\r\n\r\nperiods a day. We hope to put in at least 44 hours\r\n\r\nper  week for language teaching. But he rears  the\r\n\r\nugly  head of segregation. We have already stated,\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  that this is optional.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ncompulsory. Parents have a right to refuse; and if\r\n\r\nthey do, their children stay where they are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important tenets of a democratic\r\n\r\nsociety  is  to  ensure that  the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\nminority are respected. Which is exactly what this\r\n\r\nGovernment is trying to do in Singapore, which has\r\n\r\nlargely a Chinese population. It is important that\r\n\r\nwe  must  give in a little to the Malay and  Tamil\r\n\r\nsections of the public who form the minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As things stand in the English schools, I should\r\n\r\nlike now to inform the Member for Farrer Park what\r\n\r\npresent  conditions are like for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nteaching  Malay and Tamil in English schools.  The\r\r\n\r\nnumbers  are too small to form a class because  we\r\n\r\nhave perhaps five, or three, or one Malay pupil or\r\n\r\nTamil  in  a  class. Almost every  class  in  most\r\n\r\nschools  is perhaps 90 per cent Chinese. When  the\r\n\r\nChinese  have their Chinese classes in an  English\r\n\r\nschool, what happens? The Malays and Tamils  could\r\n\r\nhave  their classes if they can get the  teachers.\r\n\r\nBut  they will have to have their classes in make-shift classrooms, verandahs, tiffin sheds, bicycle\r\n\r\nparks, even in the open, and sometimes next to the\r\n\r\nschool lavatories. If you call that segregation, I\r\n\r\nthrow  my  hands.  Here is a case  of  wanting  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  minority with as good facilities  as\r\n\r\nthe majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel, Mr Speaker, that perhaps there will be\r\n\r\nmore  time  for  me  during  the  period  in   the\r\n\r\nCommittee  of  Supply to answer  other  questions,\r\n\r\nsince time is the limiting factor tonight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.35 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  had  the tables  been  turned,  we\r\n\r\nwould,  I think, have given the Opposition a  much\r\n\r\nmore rousing time than they have given us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult to take seriously opponents\r\n\r\nwho  cannot stand up to your punches. One  gets  a\r\n\r\nfeeling  of  being cruel to people who,  when  you\r\n\r\nknock  them down once, stay down for an indefinite\r\n\r\nlength of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pay cuts, the pay cuts, the pay cuts! Round\r\n\r\nand  round  the mulberry bush! There  was  nothing\r\n\r\nother than the pay cuts. Then there was the Member\r\n\r\nfor Cairnhill's favourite technique of fishing  in\r\n\r\ntroubled  waters.  I  have  told  him  on  several\r\n\r\noccasions  in  the past that the least  profitable\r\n\r\nthing  is to try and exploit differences  real  or\r\n\r\nsupposed  in the P.A.P. We are a democratic  Party\r\n\r\nwith  a  tremendous amount of guts and  gusto.  We\r\n\r\nhave  our  differences of opinion, and  we  settle\r\n\r\nthem  in the Party. And believe me, those  who  go\r\n\r\nfishing  in troubled waters will find that  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  a tadpole which will take the bait, but a big\r\n\r\nwhale that will take the fisherman into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Sunday School teacher who ventured into\r\n\r\nthe  fields of economics and high finance - I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether  we ought to take him seriously,  or\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should sit down and laugh  our  heads\r\n\r\noff.  The  bits  of  ill-digested,  ill-understood\r\n\r\neconomic  titbits do not make up for  an  economic\r\n\r\nphilosophy,  and that is what is in this  document\r\n\r\nproduced  by  the  P.A.P. Government  through  its\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Finance.  There  is  a   political\r\n\r\nphilosophy  underlying  an  economic  treatise.  I\r\n\r\nthought  today, if they had some people who  could\r\n\r\nhelp  them  do their thinking - as was suggested  by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Tanglin that he had some  friends\r\n\r\nwhom  he  had  consulted on  these  high  economic\r\n\r\nmatters - that they would have propounded a counter-economic  theory. All we had was a lot  of  rather\r\n\r\nsour and not very clever witticisms. That was what\r\n\r\nthe  Opposition choose to believe  is  a  throttle\r\n\r\nattack on the P.A.P. Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not in this House when I was being quoted\r\n\r\nfrom   Hansard,  and  I  therefore   reserve   the\r\n\r\nopportunity to deal with the quotation later.  But\r\n\r\nI  would  remind the Member for Farrer  Park  that\r\n\r\nwhen  the P.A.P. says something, there is  usually\r\n\r\nsufficient circumspection to provide for all kinds\r\n\r\nof  contingencies. The art of political leadership\r\n\r\nlies  not  in  making reckless, irresponsible  and\r\n\r\nsweeping  generalisations. It lies in the  art  of\r\n\r\nprophecy with sufficient of the enigma of  oracles\r\n\r\nto  meet all eventualities. Indeed, Sir, for  that\r\n\r\nreason,  I  think  he  must  have  been  the  most\r\n\r\nsurprised person to find himself here because I do\r\n\r\nnot think he expected it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, may I meet the only point made by the Member\r\n\r\nfor   Farrer   Park   that  is   worthy   of   any\r\n\r\nconsideration, this pet theme of his - that the cost\r\n\r\nof   ministerial  government  has  gone  up   from\r\n\r\n$300,000  to $500,000? In the course of  the  five\r\n\r\ndays  in Committee of Supply, I shall take him  to\r\n\r\ntask  on this. First of all, on the basis  of  the\r\n\r\ncomputation; secondly, on this point - is he  really\r\n\r\nsuggesting that it would have been good government\r\n\r\nhad  he and his friends (in those halcyon days  in\r\n\r\n1955  when  they  had  ambitions  of  winning  the\r\n\r\nelection  under the Rendel Constitution)  won  and\r\n\r\nformed  the Government? This is a Government  that\r\n\r\nis  prepared to put its cards on the table - that is\r\n\r\nthe first function of the Government in this Asian\r\n\r\nsituation.  A  government that shilly-shallies  is\r\n\r\none  that perishes. We take our views out into the\r\n\r\nopen,  thrash  them  out, and  establish  what  we\r\n\r\nconsider  to be right. That is the secret  of  the\r\n\r\nstrength  of  the P.A.P. Those who seek  political\r\n\r\nlongevity  should do well to dwell on  this:  that\r\n\r\nthe  art  of  long, political life is the  art  of\r\n\r\nbeing  honest  and  being  prepared  to  meet  all\r\n\r\ncorners on the level, in the open.

For instance, in  a  shipwreck\r\n\r\nand  in  critical situations of that  nature,  the\r\n\r\nnormal pattern of behaviour is often abandoned and\r\n\r\nwe   see   the  basic  characteristics  or   basic\r\n\r\nqualities  of a person emerging. Somerset  Maugham\r\n\r\nis  the one writer whose main theme is to dwell on\r\n\r\nthe  unusual behaviour of human beings in critical\r\n\r\nor extraordinary or unusual circumstances. But,  I\r\n\r\nthink,   not   even   Somerset   Maugham's    deep\r\n\r\nunderstanding of human nature would  have  enabled\r\n\r\nhim  to forecast with any accuracy how Members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition  in  the  Singapore   Legislative\r\n\r\nAssembly will react and behave when they are faced\r\n\r\nwith  the task of criticising the first Budget  of\r\n\r\nthe People's Action Party Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find, much to our delight, that the Member for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  is a staunch champion of taxi-drivers\r\n\r\nand hawkers. The Member for Tanglin has revealed a\r\n\r\nhitherto  unsuspected predilection for out-of-date\r\n\r\nsocialist literature, and the Member for Cairnhill\r\n\r\nemerges as a Gallahad in shining armour in defence\r\n\r\nof the Nanyang University. Sir, I put it to you as\r\n\r\na  simple  and  straightforward  proposition  that\r\n\r\nthese  are  attitudes that have been adopted  with\r\n\r\nthe  general elections four and a half years hence\r\n\r\nin  mind, and that they do not reflect any genuine\r\n\r\nphilosophical conviction when they set out on  the\r\n\r\ntask of commenting on the Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid I am now engaged in a race against\r\n\r\ntime.  Within a period of about fifteen minutes  I\r\n\r\nhave to review the comments made by Members of the\r\n\r\nOpposition.  I  shall start with  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill.  He stated that he found difficulty  in\r\n\r\nadding  up  figures  which I  gave  in  my  budget\r\n\r\nstatement.  I  am  sorry I have to  go  over  this\r\n\r\nground   all  over  again.  But  I  realise   that\r\n\r\nelementary  arithmetic may be beyond the  capacity\r\n\r\nof  some  people.  When the Government  came  into\r\n\r\noffice,  the  budget  deficit  as  stated  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Estimates  was  $4  million.   That   is\r\n\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is quite true. But there was a deficit of $18\r\n\r\nmillion in the Development budget, and I think the\r\n\r\nMember  for Cairnhill did not understand that,  in\r\n\r\nthe  calculation of a possible budget deficit  for\r\n\r\nthis year, I had to take into account not only the\r\n\r\ndeficit  in the Ordinary Estimates but  the  large\r\n\r\ndeficit in the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in the budget statement, if\r\n\r\nthings  were  left  to go on  as  planned  by  the\r\n\r\nprevious  Government, we would be  faced  with  an\r\n\r\noverall deficit of $42 million, to which the  late\r\n\r\nsupplementary  estimates made  in  May  this  year\r\n\r\ncontributed $10 million. These late estimates were\r\n\r\nput up clearly with the general elections in mind.\r\n\r\nMore  important and more basic are the Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill's comments on the P.A.P. policy  towards\r\n\r\ncapital  and  trade in this country.

Now,\r\n\r\nI  wish  to recall some of the statements made  by\r\n\r\nthe   Opposition  Members  during   the   election\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I do not have the Press cuttings\r\n\r\nwith  me,  and  therefore I can  only  speak  from\r\n\r\nmemory. The Member for Cairnhill himself said that\r\n\r\nif  the  P.A.P. were to come to power,  Singapore\r\n\r\nwould be a dead city. The homes would be empty and\r\n\r\nthe  streets would be deserted. Well, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, everyone knows that during the last week  the\r\n\r\nstreets  could  not be more full than  they  were,\r\n\r\nwith  the  people  rejoicing in the  Loyalty  Week\r\n\r\ncelebrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten stated at a meeting at\r\n\r\nFullerton Square that if the P.A.P. came to power,\r\n\r\nthey  would  confiscate  jewellery.

Regardless of what the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park  said,  about  the  harmlessness  and\r\n\r\ninability of his colleagues to frighten people,  I\r\n\r\nsay that that was the effect, and that the decline\r\n\r\nin  trade  preceding the election  was  due  to  a\r\n\r\nsystematic  scare campaign conducted by Opposition\r\n\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, against their absurd and irresponsible\r\n\r\nstatements,   may  I  quote  the   P.A.P. policy\r\n\r\nstatement as contained in \"The Tasks Ahead\",  Part\r\n\r\n1,  page  25? This refers to a policy  on  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Foreign business concerns which wish to\r\n\r\nestablish factories in Singapore will be given all\r\n\r\nthe  encouragement and assistance  they  need.  We\r\n\r\nshall  give them guarantees in regard to  security\r\n\r\nof  capital,  remittance of  dividends  and  other\r\n\r\nmatters  which  all modern governments  regard  as\r\n\r\nnormal practice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, when Members of the Opposition tried to\r\n\r\nmake out that there had been a deviation or change\r\n\r\nfrom  the previous P.A.P. policy, I would  say  to\r\n\r\nthem  that  the evidence is quite to the contrary.\r\n\r\nWe  do not change our policy overnight. What we do\r\n\r\nnow   we   have  announced  during  the   election\r\n\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  particular, I would refer to the  comments  of\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Tanglin when he described what  he\r\n\r\nthought  is our dilemma today, that we  are  under\r\n\r\npressure from the membership to go what he  called\r\n\r\nthe  extreme  left, whatever that maybe,  and  the\r\n\r\nneed  to assess the real position in business.  He\r\n\r\nthen  quoted  my budget speech in respect  of  two\r\n\r\npoints. One, that the Government would see  to  it\r\n\r\nthat the exploitation of men by men which had been\r\n\r\nregarded  as  habitual and normal as a  result  of\r\n\r\ntoleration by the previous Government, will cease;\r\n\r\nand the second point he drew attention to was that\r\n\r\nif  we  want to have an expansion of business  and\r\n\r\ninvestment  of  capital we must  see  to  it  that\r\n\r\nsuitable  conditions prevail. And the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill,  doubtless as a result of his  diligent\r\n\r\nperusal  of  socialist  literature,  came  to  the\r\n\r\nconclusion that there was a contradiction in these\r\n\r\ntwo    objectives.   Our   Government   sees    no\r\n\r\ncontradiction whatsoever. In fact, if  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor   Cairnhill   insists   that   there   is    a\r\n\r\ncontradiction-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> If the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\ninsists that there is a contradiction, I can  only\r\n\r\nconclude that, by suitable conditions for business\r\n\r\nexpansion,  he meant that the exploiters  must  be\r\n\r\nencouraged to do their worst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of items, Mr Speaker, to\r\n\r\nwhich  I can only now cursorily refer. The  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Cairnhill was greatly agitated that,  by  the\r\n\r\ntransfer  of  the  Department of  Tourism  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Culture, the effect would be to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  appeal of Singapore to foreign tourists. Now,\r\n\r\nlet  me  describe  some of  the  attempts  by  the\r\n\r\nDepartment  of Tourism to attract tourists.  Under\r\n\r\nthe  previous dispensation, we all know that there\r\n\r\nwas an establishment named \"Toby's Paradise\" whose\r\n\r\nproprietor had to leave the country in a hurry and\r\n\r\nunder a cloud when the P.A.P. took over. This  was\r\n\r\none  of  the distinguished efforts of the previous\r\n\r\nGovernment to attract tourists. Then we found,  to\r\n\r\nour  horror, that an arrangement had been made  to\r\n\r\ninvite  the  winner of a competition in  Australia\r\n\r\nwho had the biggest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchest   to   come   to   Singapore.   Accordingly,\r\n\r\narrangements were made to invite Mr Chest to come\r\n\r\nand  parade him round the country in the  interest\r\n\r\nof attracting tourism. Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  this  kind of action will not only  fail  to\r\n\r\nattract tourists but will hold the country  up  to\r\n\r\nridicule and contempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten made a number of\r\n\r\ncomments in defence of her proposal to restore the\r\n\r\nvariable  allowances.  She refuted  my  conclusion\r\n\r\nthat the effect of the cuts in variable allowances\r\n\r\nwas  comparatively negligible. She said  that  the\r\n\r\nfact   that   liquor  revenue   and   the   cinema\r\n\r\nattendances  were well maintained  had,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nincreased proved nothing, because these were forms\r\n\r\nof enjoyment catering only to, if I may quote her,\r\n\r\n\"rich  magnates\". Now, we know that the number  of\r\n\r\nseats  in a cinema total several thousands  and  I\r\n\r\nwould  be astonished to learn that it is the  rich\r\n\r\nmagnates and the business tycoons who swamped  the\r\n\r\n$1 and 50 cent-seats in the cinemas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Tanglin quoted at length a\r\n\r\nbook  published in 1925 to advise me on  financial\r\n\r\nprudence.  I  am afraid I cannot be  persuaded  to\r\n\r\nfall  in with his point of view and, in any  case,\r\n\r\nhe  failed  to  realise  that  there  is  a  basic\r\n\r\ndifference   between  Singapore,  which   has   an\r\n\r\nautomatic currency, and the United Kingdom,  which\r\n\r\nhas  a  central bank, and it is possible  for  the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom Government to budget for a deficit\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nget  finance from the central bank. But these  are\r\n\r\ntechnical matters which I will not pursue now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the variable allowances, everyone\r\n\r\nsays:  \"Why not pay them more? This would help  to\r\n\r\nmake taxi-drivers and hawkers more prosperous, and\r\n\r\nwe  may  assist  local industry.\" The  Member  for\r\n\r\nMountbatten  presumes that if we were  to  restore\r\n\r\nthe  variable  allowances, the  purchase  of  soap\r\n\r\nmanufactured in Singapore would increase  to  such\r\n\r\nan  extent  that  it would solve  the  problem  of\r\n\r\nindustry.  But  let me come to the point.  If  you\r\n\r\nwant  to  pay  them more, where will you  get  the\r\n\r\nmoney  from?  Among  the Opposition  Members,  one\r\n\r\ndetects a lack of unanimity because the Member for\r\n\r\nFarrer  Park,  who  has  a lot  of  experience  in\r\n\r\nfinancial  matters, has concluded  that  no  other\r\n\r\nbudget is possible in the general interest of  the\r\n\r\ncountry, and therefore-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.
