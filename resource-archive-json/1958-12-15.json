In\r\n\r\nthe  new Planning Bill, there is provision for  all\r\n\r\nlocal  authorities to levy an improvement  rate  in\r\n\r\ntheir areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the Planning Bill will not be in force by\r\n\r\nthe time the Rural Board takes over these new areas\r\n\r\non the 1st of January, 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Katong and Braddell Heights, the City\r\n\r\nCouncil  at present levies an improvement  rate  in\r\n\r\nthese  areas,  and it is considered that  the  rate\r\n\r\nshould  continue to be levied when the Rural  Board\r\n\r\ntakes over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also provision in the Bill for the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  exempt any areas from payment  of  an\r\n\r\nimprovement  rate. It is therefore  proposed  that,\r\n\r\nfor  the  time being, exemption should be given  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of Ulu Pandan and Pasir Panjang  when  the\r\n\r\nRural Board hands them over to the City Council  on\r\n\r\n1st  January, 1959. An improvement rate is  not  at\r\n\r\npresent levied in these areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions of which I have spoken are\r\n\r\ncontained in clause 3 of the Bill.

People  select  him\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  services he has rendered  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry. This has happened in India, Burma,  Ceylon\r\n\r\nand  many  other countries where they have  had  to\r\n\r\nfight  for their freedom. Similarly with the  other\r\n\r\nMinisters.  Here, of course, with the  progress  of\r\n\r\ntime, the colonial powers - the United Kingdom is the\r\n\r\nonly colonial power left in the Far East - are giving\r\n\r\nus constitutional progress, and we have now come to\r\n\r\nthe stage of internal self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chief Minister's post carries a salary\r\n\r\ncomparable to that of the Chief Secretary, and  the\r\n\r\nChief  Justice - he is above them. But let me explain\r\n\r\nfurther. As I have said in my speech on the  Budget\r\n\r\nthe salary structure is too high. The local man has\r\n\r\nnot got to run two homes. He stays in his home.  He\r\n\r\nmight  possibly be shifted in future to a different\r\n\r\none,  i.e. the  Government provide  residence  and\r\n\r\nother benefits. Sir, I would suggest that as we are\r\n\r\nreplacing  the White men with our local men,  their\r\n\r\nsalaries should be fixed by the incoming Government\r\n\r\nper local requirements. I also want to know who  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  fix the salary of the Prime Minister  of\r\n\r\nthe  incoming Government and whether the salary  of\r\n\r\nthe  present  Chief  Minister will  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ncontinue.   I  would  suggest  that  the   incoming\r\n\r\nGovernment  consider my points in the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe  taxpayers.  They  should  not  pay  the  Chief\r\n\r\nMinister the maximum for such a post of honour, but\r\n\r\nshould  reduce his salary and the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nMinisters as well to suit the local needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nRendel  Constitution  came into  force,  there  was\r\n\r\nnothing   in  the  Budget  regarding  payments   of\r\n\r\nsalaries  to  be made to Ministers and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  first Government which came into office  under\r\n\r\nthat Constitution had to consider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat salaries were fair for Ministers.

If the job  is  not  done\r\n\r\nproperly  then we know what our feelings should  be\r\n\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of the Chief Minister's\r\n\r\noffice,  I  have noticed that for three long  years\r\n\r\nthe  Chief Minister has also been the Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Welfare and that the Chief  Minister's\r\n\r\npost is one without a portfolio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I notice that this year there is going\r\n\r\nto  be  added another department called  the  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment    Department   with   a   Commissioner\r\n\r\nappointed.  I  think not only are Members  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  grateful for that appointment, but also  all\r\n\r\nthe  people in Singapore, especially those  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas.  It  is  a long  time  since  anybody\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  rural  areas.  Attention  has  been\r\n\r\nfocussed on the city and the rural folks have  been\r\n\r\nleft  to  do what they can for themselves and  with\r\n\r\nwhatever means\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  have  at their command. In fact, in comparing\r\n\r\nthe  Rural  Board to the City Council, I think  the\r\n\r\nRural Board is a very poor cousin, one of the  very\r\n\r\npoor  relatives who are always living from hand  to\r\n\r\nmouth,  holding  out their hands  and  begging  for\r\n\r\nmoney   and   then  finding  that   not   much   is\r\n\r\nforthcoming,  or  what  is  coming  will  never  be\r\n\r\nsufficient for any project. The people in the  city\r\n\r\nlive in houses made of brick, mortar and stones and\r\n\r\nsupplied with modern sanitation, but the people  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  live in attap  huts.  While  the\r\n\r\npeople in the city have good, well-lighted and well-metalled  roads to move about, the  people  in  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  must content themselves  with  moving\r\n\r\nalong  unmade-up  roads, or  even  roads  that  are\r\n\r\nalmost  impassable. Bridges in the  city  area  may\r\n\r\ncost  as much as a few million dollars, whereas  in\r\n\r\nthe  rural  areas  you may still find  the  one-log\r\n\r\nbridge - the  trunk  of  a coconut  tree  felled  and\r\n\r\nplaced  across a river or stream to form a  bridge.\r\n\r\nWe find that the health problem in the city is well\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlooked  after, with many clinics spotted  all  over\r\n\r\nthe  place, whereas in the rural areas they are few\r\n\r\nand  far between. Sir, all these are just a few  of\r\n\r\nthe  examples of how the rural people  have  always\r\n\r\nbeen treated by the Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as we look through the whole Budget we\r\n\r\nfind  that  the  Chief Minister has remembered  the\r\n\r\nrural  people.  He has appointed a Commissioner  to\r\n\r\ndeal   directly   with   the   problem   of   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment. I am sure this scheme is going to help\r\n\r\nthe rural folks in giving them more amenities. I am\r\n\r\naware that work has already been started, and  that\r\n\r\nroads  are  being made. Many of the unemployed  are\r\n\r\nfinding  this Department a useful means of  gaining\r\n\r\ntheir  self-respect, by earning their money instead\r\n\r\nof  getting  it from the Social Welfare Department.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  like the Chief Minister to  remember\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  not  only  is the work that  is  in  progress\r\n\r\nimportant and must be carried out but that more  of\r\n\r\nsuch  work  must be done. Work should  be  selected\r\n\r\nfrom all areas in Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbased  on population concentration and requirements\r\n\r\nwith  a view to long-term development. I would also\r\n\r\nurge the Chief Minister to make known to the people\r\n\r\nthe nature of this work, and that the people should\r\n\r\nactively  co-operate with the  Government  to  help\r\n\r\nthemselves.  I  would like to see a scheme  whereby\r\n\r\nthe  Government is identified with  the  people.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to see it not only welcomed and praised\r\n\r\nby the people but that the people should show their\r\n\r\nwillingness  to co-operate with the  Government  by\r\n\r\ncoming out and contributing what they can for their\r\n\r\nown welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take an example, Sir. Suppose we have a\r\n\r\nstretch  of road that must be repaired.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  to see just the Government coming along  with\r\n\r\ntheir employees repairing that stretch of road  and\r\n\r\nthen  going  away  quietly. It does  not  give  the\r\n\r\npeople  a  feeling  that something  is  being  done\r\n\r\nespecially  for  them.  I would  like  to  see  the\r\n\r\nrequest  coming from the people for  making  up  or\r\n\r\nrepairing  of  roads  or bridges  and  that  it  be\r\n\r\nchannelled   to   the   Commissioner    of    Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment. Thereafter, there may be a  conference\r\n\r\nbetween   government  officers   and   the   people\r\n\r\nconcerned,  and a plan drawn up whereby the  people\r\n\r\nwill  assist the Government in pointing  out  those\r\n\r\nplaces  that need repair. Those who can come  along\r\n\r\nto  help  voluntarily will come forward to help  in\r\n\r\nthat  capacity,  thus showing  that  they  are  not\r\n\r\nhelping  because  they are paid, but  because  they\r\n\r\nhave  a  sense of civic responsibility. Then  also,\r\n\r\nthey  could,  by discussion between  them  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, get the Government away from the  usual\r\n\r\nred  tape of doing exactly what the people  do  not\r\n\r\nwant them to do, and do instead the right thing. In\r\n\r\nfact,   I   know  many  projects  where  Government\r\n\r\nofficials  want  to  implement  their  pet  schemes\r\n\r\nwithout  consulting the people, and they  ended  in\r\n\r\nfailure.   Here   is  an  opportunity   for   great\r\n\r\nparticipation,  where the people can  be  consulted\r\n\r\nand  where  they can give their best ideas  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am only quoting an example of road\r\n\r\nbuilding or road repairing. There are other  things\r\n\r\nthe Government can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps  Government can assist the people in  large\r\n\r\nscale   fruit  plantation.  Perhaps  we  may   have\r\n\r\nGovernment  loaning  out  tractors  for   ploughing\r\n\r\nagricultural areas, and in that way save a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntrouble for the people. Perhaps the Government  may\r\n\r\nassist  the  people  in poultry  and  pig  rearing.\r\n\r\nGovernment may perhaps be able to give these  hard-working rural folks a new store. Or Government  may\r\n\r\nbe able to give them poultry, cattle, goats or pigs\r\n\r\nin  order  to breed better strains and in order  to\r\n\r\nincrease their production. I think a host of  these\r\n\r\nthings can be done for the people if the Government\r\n\r\nwill go to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, of course, the Chief Minister to\r\n\r\nlet  us  know  more  details about  these  schemes,\r\n\r\nespecially  in this Assembly, so that they  may  be\r\n\r\nconveyed  to  the people and the people  will  know\r\n\r\nthat the Government are going all out to help them,\r\n\r\nand help them in the right way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do\r\n\r\nnot  want  to  repeat what I already  said  on  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading on Friday; but on this  subject  of\r\n\r\nthe  Rural Development Panel which the hon.

Our rural areas  happen\r\n\r\nto be not very big compared with the rural areas in\r\n\r\nmost  countries  which  have  a  large  land  mass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps   it   is  for  that  reason   that   rural\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment  has  been neglected  in  the  past.  I\r\n\r\npersonally  think  that the real reason  why  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment  was neglected in the past  is  because\r\n\r\nthe  Government in those days was mainly interested\r\n\r\nin Singapore's progress as a commercial centre, and\r\n\r\ntherefore the concentration on development was more\r\n\r\non  the  city  itself, which played a part  in  the\r\n\r\ncommercial  development  of  Singapore.  Not   much\r\n\r\ninterest  was  therefore taken in the  rural  areas\r\n\r\nwhich   were  not  directly  contributing  to   the\r\n\r\ncommercial progress of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things have changed, Sir, since the last few\r\n\r\nyears.   Rural  development  now  assumes  a   more\r\n\r\nimportant   role  in  our  economy,   because   the\r\n\r\ncommercial   progress   of  Singapore   is   slowly\r\n\r\ndwindling,  with the result that we  have  to  rely\r\n\r\nmore  and more on our home production and cut  down\r\n\r\non  imports.  For that reason, Sir, I  have  always\r\n\r\nadvocated  that the development of the rural  areas\r\n\r\nshould   receive  better  encouragement  from   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, so that we may be able to produce  more\r\n\r\nof  our  own foodstuffs at home and thereby  depend\r\n\r\nless  on imported foodstuffs, and spend less  money\r\n\r\non  imported foodstuffs. The progress made  because\r\n\r\nof  rural  development has been phenomenal  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  three years, as I have often stated  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  and  outside. We have been able  to  achieve\r\n\r\nremarkable  progress in poultry rearing. Production\r\n\r\nof  poultry  has  increased from 5  million  to  25\r\n\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our rural development assistance consists of\r\n\r\nthree  phases.  In the first phase,  attention  has\r\n\r\nbeen  given  to the elimination of risk  which  the\r\n\r\nfanner  would normally, take because of the disease\r\n\r\nfactor   in  the  livestock.  Once  that  risk   is\r\n\r\nlessened, then the farmer would proceed to go  into\r\n\r\nlivestock production in a big way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor is that farmers should be given\r\n\r\nthe  advantage  of scientific knowledge  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  accrued  over the years, and, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nsecond phase is to give them that knowledge through\r\n\r\nresearch   work   carried  out  in   Singapore   by\r\n\r\nspecialists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third phase will be to encourage the farmer\r\n\r\nto enter the export market and thereby create a new\r\n\r\nindustry  for  Singapore. We should earn  money  by\r\n\r\nthese exports.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There again research is important. It should also\r\n\r\nbe part of Government's policy to carry out further\r\n\r\nresearch in order not only to eliminate the disease\r\n\r\nfactor in poultry rearing, but also to cut down the\r\n\r\ncost  and  the  time  of production,  so  that  the\r\n\r\nultimate cost would\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  cheaper, and therefore the farmer would be able\r\n\r\nto  compete in the export market. In fact, that  is\r\n\r\nwhat is happening now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now not only self-sufficient in pigs,\r\n\r\nabout  60 per cent of which used to be imported  in\r\n\r\n1955,  but  we  are  actually  exporting  them   to\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>10.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reference was made by the Member for Tanglin\r\n\r\nto a statement in the Budget that rural development\r\n\r\nwas not co-ordinated in the past. That was so, Sir,\r\n\r\nbecause   rural  development  consists  of  various\r\n\r\naspects  which  were  being  handled  by  different\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, land alienation and resettlement\r\n\r\nwere   in  the  hands  of  the  Ministry  of  Local\r\n\r\nGovernment,  Lands and Housing; the development  of\r\n\r\nroads  and bridges was in the hands of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Communications and Works; assistance to farmers\r\n\r\nin   the  raising  of  livestock  and  agricultural\r\n\r\nproduction, the use of fertilisers, germicides  and\r\n\r\nso on, were in the hands of my Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that would mean that three or four\r\n\r\nMinistries  were  handling rural  development  from\r\n\r\ndifferent aspects. It was necessary to have  a  co-ordinating body to centralize the work, so that all\r\n\r\naspects of rural development would go hand in  hand\r\n\r\nand  the whole project would not lag behind because\r\n\r\none  aspect  had  lagged behind. That  is  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  decided  last  year  to  form  a  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment Panel and, as I explained to the  House\r\n\r\nlast  year, it was thought that the best person  to\r\n\r\nco-ordinate   the   activities   of   the   various\r\n\r\nMinistries  would be the Chief Minister.  He  could\r\n\r\nthen  issue directives to the Ministries concerned,\r\n\r\nsaying,  \"I  want this aspect to forge ahead\",  and\r\n\r\ncould  ask questions as to why one aspect  was  not\r\n\r\ngoing   ahead,  thereby  holding  up  other   rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment work, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanglin also raised another\r\n\r\npoint - why   no  reference  was  made  to   District\r\n\r\nCouncils playing a part in rural development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that they were not mentioned does not\r\n\r\nmean that they will not be consulted, but since the\r\n\r\nrural  development envisaged in  the  Budget  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of Government expenditure out of the public\r\n\r\nrevenue,  that is, Government revenue, it  is  only\r\n\r\nfit  that  the  Panel should consist of  Government\r\n\r\ndepartment  heads.  But  it  is  quite  clear  that\r\n\r\nwherever any matter concerns the District Councils,\r\n\r\nthe  Rural  Development Commissioner would  consult\r\n\r\nthem  and  get  their opinion on the  subject.  Any\r\n\r\ndefinite  decision has got to be made only  by  the\r\n\r\nPanel  because it is Government money that is being\r\n\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Sir, I would not like it to be\r\n\r\nthought - and  I think my hon, friend  who  has  just\r\n\r\nspoken  rather  implied  it -  that  I  was  against\r\n\r\ncentralisation, the Rural Development Panel and the\r\n\r\nnecessity  of  having  a  co-ordinating  body   for\r\n\r\nimproving our rural areas. I am very much in favour\r\n\r\nof   them.   But   in   these  days   of   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  I think we' should consider  whether\r\n\r\nwe   can  afford  the  luxury  of  having  so  many\r\n\r\nadministrative  bodies  on  a  small  island,   and\r\n\r\nwhether  we  should not think afresh about  greater\r\n\r\ncentralisation rather than greater decentralisation\r\n\r\nof  local  government - which is the way in which  we\r\n\r\nare moving at present. It is not too late for us to\r\n\r\nreconsider  and  give a further appraisal  to  this\r\n\r\nwhole problem. It has been sparked off, I think, by\r\n\r\nthe   fact  that  the  Government  have  found   it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to set up this Panel to look  after  the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  local farmers and the people  living\r\n\r\nand working in the rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many problems connected with\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our livestock production and our egg\r\n\r\nproduction. There has been an enormous  advance  in\r\n\r\nthe  last few years, and it has been a very welcome\r\n\r\none.  At the same time, it has its dangers and  its\r\n\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Minister for Commerce and Industry\r\n\r\nwill agree with me that egg production has probably\r\n\r\ndropped in the last six or nine months, the  reason\r\n\r\nbeing that, because of the enormous increase in egg\r\n\r\nproduction, the price of eggs has dropped, I think,\r\n\r\nfrom 14 or 13 cents to something like 10 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat  is  because there has been overproduction.  A\r\n\r\nlot  of the farmers in the rural areas are fighting\r\n\r\nshy  of going in for poultry because of this  drop.\r\n\r\nThey  are unable to make both ends meet in  keeping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npoultry. As a result of this, the price of eggs has\r\n\r\nbegun  to rise again and perhaps found its economic\r\n\r\nlevel somewhere around 13 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the problem here - maybe the Minister can\r\n\r\ninform  us - is whether we can cheapen feeding stuffs\r\n\r\nfor poultry, so that the price of eggs can drop and\r\n\r\nthe farmers can make a living. That is the crux  of\r\n\r\nthe  whole  problem. In the good old  days,  as  we\r\n\r\nsometimes  call  them, there was  the  kampong  hen\r\n\r\nwhich could scratch around wherever it liked in the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood of the village, eating whatever there\r\n\r\nwas off the ground, and it produced one egg a week.\r\n\r\nYou  can  call  that pure gain. Now  that  our  new\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmethods  are concentrated methods, possibly  a  hen\r\n\r\ncould  produce four eggs a week, but  if  it  costs\r\n\r\nthree and a half eggs in foodstuffs to produce them\r\n\r\nit is not pure gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the problem with which we are faced in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and it is one which certainly requires a\r\n\r\nRural  Development  Panel  to  look  into  and   to\r\n\r\ncentralise all our methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, that is\r\n\r\nexactly  what  I  meant. I will be  coming  to  the\r\n\r\nM.C.S. salaries later on in Head 8. But here, I  am\r\n\r\nconcerned with salaries of the elected Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Colony should pay salaries according to its\r\n\r\nmeans.  These  should not be so  high  that,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult,  the burden on the taxpayers gets  heavier,\r\n\r\nas we have seen during these 3\u00bd years. If we were\r\n\r\nto  reduce the salaries of the Ministers,  who  are\r\n\r\nelected  by  the  people, it would be  possible  to\r\n\r\nbring down the salaries of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of administration, as I have said in my\r\n\r\nspeech on the Budget, takes up 55 or 65 per cent of\r\n\r\nour revenue. How are you going to start building up\r\n\r\nSingapore's financial position in a sound way if we\r\n\r\nare  to pay as we have been paying the expatriates?\r\n\r\nAs  I  have  pointed  out, I  am  not  against  the\r\n\r\nexpatriates, because they had to run two homes. But\r\n\r\nmy  suggestion, on principle, is this - that the  cut\r\n\r\nin  salaries should start at the top and  then  the\r\n\r\nadministration  cost  will  come  down.  That  will\r\n\r\nreduce  the  burden  on  the  taxpayers;  it   will\r\n\r\nincrease  the trade and industry of the Colony;  it\r\n\r\nwill  bring  down the cost of living, and  we  will\r\n\r\nthen be able to compete with others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I move my amendment on principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> The Member for Tanglin, Sir,\r\n\r\nhas   brought  out  one  or  two  points  on  rural\r\n\r\ndevelopment which I think need explaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that egg production has taken a slight\r\n\r\ndip in the last few months. The reason was not only\r\n\r\nbecause there was greater egg production, but  also\r\n\r\nbecause there was strong competition from eggs from\r\n\r\nChina. The increase in egg production brought  down\r\n\r\nthe  price  from 14 cents to about 11  cents.  Then\r\n\r\ncame  the competition from China eggs which further\r\n\r\nbrought  down the price to eight cents. The farmers\r\n\r\nfound  that  this was an uneconomical  price,  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, production was lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we took the stand that all imported eggs\r\n\r\nshould  be  stamped, it has put a  little  curb  on\r\n\r\nunfair  competition and has resulted in the farmers\r\n\r\ntaking   an   interest  again  in  increasing   egg\r\n\r\nproduction. At the present moment, egg imports from\r\n\r\nChina  have  considerably lessened, not because  of\r\n\r\nthe stamping requirement, but because, I think,  of\r\n\r\nthe seasonal shortage in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of cheaper feeding stuffs\r\n\r\nfor  livestock. Feeding stuffs are imported, except\r\n\r\nprobably  a  little  bit  that  is  found  here  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The price of feeding stuffs  is  beyond\r\n\r\nthe control of the Government. We have to depend on\r\n\r\nthe  market  prices  prevailing  in  the  supplying\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we are now doing is carrying out\r\n\r\nresearch into the dietetics of livestock and, if we\r\n\r\nsucceed,  we may be able to find a mean diet  which\r\n\r\nwill  be  cheaper than, and just as nutritious  as,\r\n\r\nthe present diet provided by the farmers. If we can\r\n\r\ndo  that,  I  am sure we can cheapen  the  cost  of\r\n\r\npoultry and pig production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which the hon. Member raised was\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore cannot afford to have more of  such\r\n\r\nbodies  as District Councils, City Council and  the\r\n\r\nRural Development Panel. But this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanel  is not paid, Sir,It is just a co-ordinating\r\n\r\nPanel  of Government officials who receive no extra\r\n\r\npay.

We have heard from  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Commerce and Industry that  a  Rural\r\n\r\nDevelopment Panel is not a very costly matter,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  can  be a Panel of extreme importance.  I\r\n\r\nwelcome it. I think it is a very good thing. What I\r\n\r\nam  suggesting is that we can go one  step  further\r\n\r\nand  save so much expense in administration  if  we\r\n\r\nstreamline the whole of our administration in  this\r\n\r\nvery small island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Tun Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nChairman, Sir, I am at last tempted to rise from my\r\n\r\nseat!

In view of the fact that it is  quite\r\n\r\nclear  that the revenue which we can obtain  cannot\r\n\r\nrise  very  much above the present  level  of  $264\r\n\r\nmillion for 1959 - this is a rough guess; it might be\r\n\r\ncloser to $300 million - and whereas it is inevitable\r\n\r\nthat   expenditure  must  rise,   particularly   in\r\n\r\neducation, which is one of the most tricky problems\r\n\r\nwe  have - how  to  educate all  our  children - I  put\r\n\r\nforward  the  thought  that we  cannot  afford  the\r\n\r\nluxuries  of  the democratic system  but  only  the\r\n\r\nnecessities. I felt the luxuries were to have three\r\n\r\nor  four  District Councils plus the  City  Council\r\n\r\nplus  the national (or central) Government and  all\r\n\r\nthe  other  administrative bodies that we  have  on\r\n\r\nsuch a small island. I asked whether we should  not\r\n\r\nall  of us think again whether we can afford it and\r\n\r\nwhether  we should not run this island  as  a  City\r\n\r\nState, as I put it, with a single, streamline, well-planned  administrative body. I  further  gave  the\r\n\r\nthought that if in the future we were to merge with\r\n\r\nthe Federation, it would be easier for that to come\r\n\r\nabout  as  a result of having put our own house  in\r\n\r\nstreamlined order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Chairman,\r\n\r\nSir, in my division I find there are many plots  of\r\n\r\nland   lying  fallow.

In the next Assembly we will not have any  ex-officio  Ministers.  Sir,  in  a  small  city  like\r\n\r\nSingapore we have six elected Ministers, three  ex-officio  Ministers  and four  Assistant  Ministers.\r\n\r\nWill  it  not  be wise now for one or two  or  even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  Ministries to be amalgamated into  one?  The\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary is a very important  Minister.  In\r\n\r\nother countries I believe he is called the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs. I do not know what the incoming\r\n\r\nGovernment's designation will be of this  Ministry,\r\n\r\nbut as it will be retained, I suggest the abolition\r\n\r\nof  the  Ministry  of Law as this Ministry  can  be\r\n\r\ntaken  over by the Minister for Home Affairs.  This\r\n\r\nwill reduce the cost of one Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now to the principle of salary reduction,\r\n\r\nSir,  can  any honest person in Singapore say  that\r\n\r\nthe  salary  drawn  by an expatriate  Minister  and\r\n\r\nlocal  born be the same? The former has to run  two\r\n\r\nhouses but not the latter. If an expatriate officer\r\n\r\nis  replaced, then the salary of the local man  who\r\n\r\nreplaces  him should be according to the  needs  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Now  that is the proper  way  to  judge\r\n\r\nsalaries; and along with this the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nother Ministers should be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that principle, Sir, I move my amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.15 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the first item raised by the\r\n\r\nMember   for   Telok  Ayer  was  the  question   of\r\n\r\neconomising on the number of Ministries and he made\r\n\r\none  specific  suggestion as to  a  Ministry  which\r\n\r\nmight  be abolished when the new Constitution comes\r\n\r\ninto  force. I can only say on that, Sir, that  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  Ministries under a new government  must\r\n\r\nclearly be a matter for that government, and  there\r\n\r\nis  nothing  that I can usefully  say  on  it  here\r\n\r\nexcept  that  I would remind the hon.

I  do\r\n\r\nsuggest to the hon. Member that there is perhaps  a\r\n\r\nfundamental distinction there and that while  civil\r\n\r\nservice  salaries are properly fixed,  firstly,  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to  comparable remuneration and  benefits\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by persons outside the public service  who\r\n\r\ncarry  similar responsibilities, for Ministers,  it\r\n\r\nis  more  a  matter, I think, of politics  than  of\r\n\r\nstraight   criteria   for  fixing   civil   service\r\n\r\nsalaries.   Ministers   also   must   clearly    be\r\n\r\nremunerated  in  relation to  the  responsibilities\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are undertaking to the electorate  but\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily  on the same basis  as  the  civil\r\n\r\nservice which provides for a career during a  man's\r\n\r\nlifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the\r\n\r\nHon. the Financial Secretary enlighten us  on  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of new posts?

Of  course,  the\r\n\r\npoint of primary importance is about salaries, Sir.\r\n\r\nIs it not high time for the Government to set up  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee to survey and study the workings and  the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the public service? There is  even  a\r\n\r\ncharge  that  luxuries  are being  enjoyed  by  the\r\n\r\npublic service, because so many new posts have been\r\n\r\ncreated.  That  is  what I just  mentioned - that  in\r\n\r\n1956,  there were 1,584 new posts; in 1957,  1,727;\r\n\r\nand  in  1958, 1,723 new posts. These  exclude  the\r\n\r\nGuard  and Escort Unit. A tremendous number of  new\r\n\r\nposts  have  been created and I would like  to  ask\r\n\r\nwhether  it is possible for the Permanent Secretary\r\n\r\n(Establishment) to look into the working efficiency\r\n\r\nof   the  public  service  with  a  view  to  their\r\n\r\nimprovement, or whether arrangements can be made to\r\n\r\ncut  down  their  personal emoluments.  The  public\r\n\r\noutcry  is this: almost 50 per cent of our  revenue\r\n\r\nis spent on salaries. I think, if I am not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmistaken,  the  expenditure on  this  item  is  the\r\n\r\nhighest  in  the world. That is the first  point  I\r\n\r\nwish  to put forward to Government to consider.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  I  would like it to be borne in mind  that\r\n\r\nsuch a rearrangement must not create any mistake as\r\n\r\nfor  example  in our neighbouring countries  where,\r\n\r\nwith  the  cutting  down  of  salaries,  corruption\r\n\r\nincreases and there is less integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the second point, I wish to touch on\r\n\r\nour  internal security, Sir. Although  1958  was  a\r\n\r\nquiet    year - no   rioting   and   no    subversive\r\n\r\nactivities - the  state of affairs is uncertain.  The\r\n\r\npeople  still do not feel that they are  secure  in\r\n\r\nwhat   they   are  entitled  to  enjoy.   Gangsters\r\n\r\nterrorise society and I shall touch on this when we\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  Head - Police. But regarding  the  two\r\n\r\nmeasures  taken  by Government against  subversion:\r\n\r\nthe  first  is the striking out of certain  persons\r\n\r\nfrom  the citizenship register; the second  is  the\r\n\r\nbanning  of  some  publications from  Hongkong  and\r\n\r\nChina.  Sir, I  wish to take this  opportunity  to\r\n\r\nappeal  to the Hon, the Chief Secretary to consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  before taking drastic action  to  strike\r\n\r\noff  from the citizenship register certain persons.\r\n\r\nI have learned that many Chinese community leaders - quite  a  few  of them are members of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nChamber of Commerce - have laboured for this country.\r\n\r\nThey  have  contributed a great deal to  Singapore,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neither  in providing education or giving charities,\r\n\r\nand  yet their names have been struck off.  Sir,I\r\n\r\nwish  to  take this opportunity to ask whether  the\r\n\r\nHon, the Chief Secretary will be able to give us  a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  explanation as to what  circumstances\r\n\r\nhave decided him that such persons' names should be\r\n\r\nstruck off from the citizenship register.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the banning of publications, Sir.\r\n\r\nDespite  the announcement made that over 400  books\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave been released by the Hon, the Chief Secretary,\r\n\r\nthere are still thousands of publications which are\r\n\r\nalready  in the bookstores and libraries, and  even\r\n\r\nin the hands of students and teachers. I would like\r\n\r\nto  quote  a  specific case. Even  in  the  English\r\n\r\nschools - because many of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish  schools  have Chinese lessons -  there  are\r\n\r\nmany pamphlets and works on literature published in\r\n\r\nPeking and Hongkong and yet such publications  have\r\n\r\nalso  been  banned by the Government  at  the  same\r\n\r\ntime.  Therefore,  why have all  these  unnecessary\r\n\r\ninconveniences  as  a result of  introducing  these\r\n\r\nmeasures  which,  in  the  minds  of  the   Chinese\r\n\r\ncommunity, especially the intellectuals, are  harsh\r\n\r\nand rash? Will the Hon, the Chief Secretary give  a\r\n\r\ndetailed explanation as to why a lot of books which\r\n\r\nhave   already   been  censored  by   the   Chinese\r\n\r\nSecretariat - if  I am not mistaken,  the  Government\r\n\r\nhas said, \"Tighten the grip and reimpose the ban on\r\n\r\nthe  importation of such publications\" - are  in  the\r\n\r\nhands of many school students and individuals,  and\r\n\r\nwhat  are  they going to do since such  books  have\r\n\r\nbeen  officially banned by the Government but  they\r\n\r\nhave  already  bought  them  before  the  ban   was\r\n\r\nimposed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is on external affairs. Since\r\n\r\nexternal  affairs  is in the hands  of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom, and also the Hon, the Chief Secretary will\r\n\r\nbe  responsible  for this even in  the  future  new\r\n\r\nConstitution,  I  wonder  if  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary  will  express  the  public  opinion   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  towards  S.E.A.T.O.,  and  whether   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has decided to issue an  invitation  to\r\n\r\nmake Singapore a rendezvous for S.E.A.T.O. meetings\r\n\r\nhere?  If this can be avoided, so much the  better,\r\n\r\nbecause public opinion should be respected.  And  I\r\n\r\nassure  you  that, if you can make it  possible  to\r\n\r\nhave  a Gallup poll taken on this subject, you will\r\n\r\nfind that the people here do not want to embark  on\r\n\r\nany,  say,  cold  war conflict,  and  unfortunately\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. is one of the main controversial  issues\r\n\r\nin   the  minds  of  Asians  today.  I  wish   that\r\n\r\nS.E.A.T.O. would not take Singapore as  the  ideal\r\n\r\nmeeting place for their future meetings because the\r\n\r\npublic  here  do not welcome them. This  will  stop\r\n\r\nunnecessary  ill-feeling  that  Singapore  is   the\r\n\r\nGibraltar of the East, that Singapore is a  British\r\n\r\nimperialist  military base. I think  that  is  very\r\n\r\nharmful to our belief that our independence  should\r\n\r\nbe the cause of peaceful evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on this subject of external affairs\r\n\r\nis  the echo of the Afro-Asian national aspiration.\r\n\r\nFrom  time  to  time meetings are  held  in  Cairo,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDjakarta or some other Afro-Asian country, and,  if\r\n\r\nI  am  not  mistaken, the Federation of Malaya  has\r\n\r\ntaken  part  in quite a number of such meetings  on\r\n\r\nmatters  of  economy  and  culture;  and  yet   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  have never  for  one  moment\r\n\r\nconsidered sending a delegation or even an observer\r\n\r\nto  such conferences. Therefore, what I wish to put\r\n\r\nforward to the Chief Secretary is this: the general\r\n\r\nfeeling  among  the  people here  is  to  echo,  to\r\n\r\nsupport,   any  move  of  the  Afro-Asian  national\r\n\r\naspiration;  and if we sincerely believe  that  the\r\n\r\nBritish Government are honest and happy to grant us\r\n\r\nindependence then they should practise that honesty\r\n\r\nby  showing  us a good example and encourage  us - by\r\n\r\nallowing a Singapore delegation to attend  as  many\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian conferences as they wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Sir,  Singapore  will  be\r\n\r\ngetting  a  new  constitution  for  internal  self-government, but it will have no responsibility  for\r\n\r\ndefence  or external affairs. I do not know whether\r\n\r\nany  S.E.A.T.O. meetings are held in Singapore.  If\r\n\r\nthey are held, I think it is improper. Meetings  of\r\n\r\nsuch  nature  should be held in  those  territories\r\n\r\nwhich are members of S.E.A.T.O. Singapore is not  a\r\n\r\nmember.   The   United   Kingdom   Government   is.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  on this principle, meetings should  not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe held in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like to raise a question on subhead 61  of\r\n\r\nHead   8,  page  67 - Rent  on  Quarters.  Why   must\r\n\r\nGovernment,  year  in and year out,  spend  such  a\r\n\r\nlarge  sum  of  money on rent on quarters?  It  has\r\n\r\nalready been pointed out time and time again to the\r\n\r\nGovernment that this unnecessary expenditure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  not  arise. Furthermore, Government  should\r\n\r\nnot waste public money on such a silly item.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Sir, most of the bungalows\r\n\r\nprovided for all Government officials are bungalows\r\n\r\nwith two or three bedrooms with bathrooms attached.\r\n\r\nWhy   cannot   Government  make   arrangements   to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccommodate  two  families  in  the  same  bungalow\r\n\r\ninstead of one family living in one big bungalow of\r\n\r\nfour   bedrooms?  Moreover,  the  bungalow   itself\r\n\r\noccupies   a  very  large  piece  of  ground.   The\r\n\r\noccupants  of  these bungalows never  make  use  of\r\n\r\nthese  bungalows. I also understand that Government\r\n\r\nhave  to pay for the maintenance of these bungalows\r\n\r\nand their grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to subhead 10 in page 57, Sir - Upkeep of\r\n\r\nChief  Secretary's Residence. In the year  1958  we\r\n\r\nare  spending $13,860. We have here today a sum  of\r\n\r\n$4,620  which  is  only a part  provision  of  this\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  This is unnecessary.  Why  must  this\r\n\r\nmoney  be  spent  at the expense of the  taxpayer's\r\n\r\npocket? Government should try to conserve, as  many\r\n\r\nMembers themselves have pointed out in this  House,\r\n\r\nand  should  try  to cut down expenditure  to  save\r\n\r\nmoney.  As  we  all  know,  we  have  spent   money\r\n\r\nunnecessarily on things like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another item, Sir, is in page 59, subhead\r\n\r\n20 - Teachers'   Allowances.   I   would   like    an\r\n\r\nexplanation  from the Chief Secretary  as  to  what\r\n\r\nthis  amount  is  for.  Sir,  the  Hon. the  Chief\r\n\r\nSecretary's  Ministry has cost the  taxpayer  about\r\n\r\n$7,240,000. I am quite sure, Sir, this money can be\r\n\r\nsaved.  If we cannot cut it by 50 per cent, we  can\r\n\r\ncut  it by 40, 30 or at least 20 per cent. Look  at\r\n\r\nsubhead  54,  page  66 - Passages  and  Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nTravelling   Expenses.  In  1958  the   amount   is\r\n\r\n$1,200,000. This year it is $1,130,000 - a saving  of\r\n\r\n$70,000 - but that is not enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Sir, I\r\n\r\nhave  a  number of points to review in a relatively\r\n\r\nshort  time.  The hon. Member for Changi  suggested\r\n\r\nthat it might be useful, if I understood him\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nright,  to set up a Commission to inquire into  the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the running of the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nwith  the  object thereby of cutting  down  staffs.\r\n\r\nSir,  I  very  much  doubt  whether  setting  up  a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommission  of that kind would indeed achieve  very\r\n\r\nmuch.  A  Commission  could  clearly  only  concern\r\n\r\nitself  with  the  broad principles  of  Government\r\n\r\nadministration,  and  what is clearly  required  in\r\n\r\nrelation  to the matter which the hon.  Member  has\r\n\r\nraised is a detailed examination so that whoever is\r\n\r\nconducting the examination can satisfy us  that  in\r\n\r\nany  particular  department or  in  any  particular\r\n\r\noffice,   the  work  which  that  office  or   that\r\n\r\ndepartment has to undertake is being done with  the\r\n\r\ngreatest  economy of staff, and that all the  staff\r\n\r\nare  fully occupied. If the hon. Member will  refer\r\n\r\nto  page  64 of the Estimates, subhead 5, Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretaries  (Organisation),  he  will   see   that\r\n\r\nprovision has been made for three officers  trained\r\n\r\nin  Organisation  and Methods to be  appointed  for\r\n\r\nthis  very  purpose of investigating the efficiency\r\n\r\nof  the  working  of the different offices.  And  I\r\n\r\nwould only add to that, Sir, that in regard to  the\r\n\r\nadditional  posts required for the  Public  Service\r\n\r\nyear by year, to which the hon. Member referred, he\r\n\r\nmust  remember that year by year the Government  is\r\n\r\nbeing called upon to do more and more, and in order\r\n\r\nto  do what it undertakes to do, it has to have the\r\n\r\nnecessary wherewithal to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the hon. Member for Changi raised\r\n\r\nwas   the  working  of  the  Singapore  Citizenship\r\n\r\nRegistration  Ordinance.  Sir,  hon.  Members  will\r\n\r\nremember  that  the  provisions  inserted  in  that\r\n\r\nOrdinance   were   designed   to   facilitate   the\r\n\r\nregistration of the largest number of people in the\r\n\r\nshortest possible time, with a view to drawing up a\r\n\r\nnew  electoral register for the elections which  it\r\n\r\nwas  thought  at  that time would  be  coming  very\r\n\r\nshortly.  Every  country  which  provides  for  the\r\n\r\nnaturalisation of persons not born in  the  country\r\n\r\nalways conducts enquiries into the application made\r\n\r\nby  any  particular  individual.  It  is  a  normal\r\n\r\npractice  to provide also for referees or  sponsors\r\n\r\nfrom   responsible  citizens  who  are   themselves\r\n\r\ncitizens  of the country. In this particular  case,\r\n\r\nall applicants who filled\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup  a  form which, on the face of it, complied with\r\n\r\nthe   provisions   made  in  the  Ordinance,   were\r\n\r\nregistered without further ado. But it was intended\r\n\r\nat  the time when the Ordinance came in, that there\r\n\r\nshould be a review of the registrations made during\r\n\r\nthe first three months, and it was for that purpose\r\n\r\nthat  the provision was inserted in section  26  of\r\n\r\nthe  Ordinance  to  enable the Chief  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nrevoke the citizenship within twelve months of  the\r\n\r\nregistration; but it was also made quite clear that\r\n\r\nthat was no bar to a further application at a later\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of books which have been\r\n\r\nbanned  under the ban imposed on certain publishing\r\n\r\nhouses, I can assure the hon. Member that the  work\r\n\r\nis  being  carried  on with the  greatest  possible\r\n\r\nspeed.  It is being done in consultation  with  the\r\n\r\nimporting  houses concerned who, by agreement,  are\r\n\r\nacting  on  behalf  of all the  bookshops.  Certain\r\n\r\nfigures which I gave at a recent meeting show  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  some 500 books which have already  been\r\n\r\nexempted, and I will try and ensure that that  work\r\n\r\ndoes proceed with the greatest expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third point which the hon. Member raised\r\n\r\nwas  the  question  of the South-East  Asia  Treaty\r\n\r\nOrganisation.  This matter, in which  he  was  also\r\n\r\nsupported by the hon. Member for Telok Ayer,  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  to  be reopening part of the Constitutional\r\n\r\nAgreement  reached  in  1957.  It  is  specifically\r\n\r\nprovided  in  that  agreement (the  report  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional  Conference),  and   it   has   been\r\n\r\nreflected in the provision made in the Constitution\r\n\r\nthat the United Kingdom Government should have full\r\n\r\nand  free  use  of  the Base in Singapore  for  the\r\n\r\ndischarge of her defence obligations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.45 a.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am quite sure that all of us, as the\r\n\r\nhon. Member for Changi has said, would be very glad\r\n\r\nif  there was no cold war and, indeed, if we  could\r\n\r\navoid  getting caught up in it. But I am afraid  we\r\n\r\ncannot  deny  its existence, nor can we  deny  that\r\n\r\ncertain  obligations have to be accepted by certain\r\n\r\ncountries, of which the United Kingdom is  one,  to\r\n\r\ntry  and ensure that the cold war does not get into\r\n\r\na hot one, or that the potential aggressive designs\r\n\r\nof other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries should not be allowed free rein. This  is\r\n\r\na  matter which has been discussed fully and agreed\r\n\r\nin  the  Constitutional Conference, and  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink that there is any question of reopening it at\r\n\r\nthis stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member also referred to the question of\r\n\r\nAfro-Asian    meetings   and   representation    by\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  am  not  sure  whether  he  has  any\r\n\r\nparticular meetings in mind, but I would  only  say\r\n\r\non   this,   that  when  it  comes   to   attending\r\n\r\ninternational    conferences    or    international\r\n\r\nmeetings,   it  is  customary  to   wait   for   an\r\n\r\ninvitation.  I  am not aware of any  invitation  of\r\n\r\nthis  kind  which the Government has  received  and\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been turned down. I would  also  remind\r\n\r\nhim, in connection with sending representatives  to\r\n\r\nconferences  of  this  kind,  of  the  considerable\r\n\r\ncriticisms this Government has received  from  time\r\n\r\nto time from the hon.

I   understand    that\r\n\r\nrepresentations  have  been  made  to   the   Chief\r\n\r\nMinister  and the Chief Secretary on that  subject.\r\n\r\nWe  have had a reply from the Ministers saying that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  representations will be considered, but up  to\r\n\r\ntoday  we  have  had no clear-cut  views  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the Chief Secretary that\r\n\r\nRadio Malaya, or broadcasting, exists for one  very\r\n\r\nimportant  function and that is to keep the  people\r\n\r\ninformed of what the Government are doing, and  all\r\n\r\nthe  important  things that are happening  in  this\r\n\r\ncountry.  Now,  that  is of the utmost  importance.\r\n\r\nAfter    that   come   cultural   or   entertaining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbroadcasts.  But  we  must  always  remember   that\r\n\r\nbroadcasting exists primarily for the communication\r\n\r\nof  ideas - important ideas which affect  the  people\r\n\r\nmost intimately. If we take away that aspect of its\r\n\r\nfunction, then Radio Malaya, or any other medium of\r\n\r\nbroadcasting, is no more than any ordinary form  of\r\n\r\nentertainment,  like that of a  cinema  or  even  a\r\n\r\nconcert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the matter of informing the people, it is\r\n\r\nimportant that news broadcasts should reach out  to\r\n\r\nall  types of people.

If so,  the\r\n\r\ndecision   to   continue  with  the   entertainment\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in  Teochew, Kheh,  Hylam,  Foochow  is\r\n\r\ncorrect.  But the Broadcasting Department's  policy\r\n\r\nis  not  merely  to entertain the  people,  but  to\r\n\r\ninform  the people. The decision to strike off  the\r\n\r\nnews item is therefore wrong, especially when there\r\n\r\nare  more than 200,000 Teochews, Khehs, Hylams  and\r\n\r\nFoochow.  Many of them are illiterate.

Instead of finishing off at 11 o'clock  at\r\n\r\nnight, make it 12 midnight and cut down many of the\r\n\r\nnonsensical   items   in  the  English   programmes\r\n\r\nespecially the sexy jazz music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly oppose the Chief Secretary's\r\n\r\ndecision  to  cut down the news item broadcasts  in\r\n\r\nthe     vernacular     units,    despite     strong\r\n\r\nrepresentations from dignified and  very  respected\r\n\r\nguilds  and associations, as indicated by the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon.

Member.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Chinese broadcasts, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  reiterate  what  I  said  when   I\r\n\r\nannounced  this attempt to improve the standard  of\r\n\r\nChinese  broadcasts, that the only  object  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  in endeavouring to cut down the  amount\r\n\r\nof  time spent on repetition of news broadcasts  is\r\n\r\nin  order  to  improve the service for the  Chinese\r\n\r\npopulation as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Member who has spoken in this House, has\r\n\r\nspoken  solely on what it is going to mean  to  the\r\n\r\nTeochew community if these news broadcasts are cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  I  have  not heard any word on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nother  communities  for  whom  the  proposals   are\r\n\r\ndesigned to produce a better service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been into the matter further and despite\r\n\r\nthe  figures which I gave the House at the time,  I\r\n\r\nmade the first announcement that broadcasts of news\r\n\r\nbulletins at present occupy 10\u00bd hours  out  of  a\r\n\r\ntotal  weekly broadcast of 83\u00bd hours, I can  tell\r\n\r\nthe  House  that  we  will arrange  to  retain  the\r\n\r\nTeochew  broadcast - the news broadcast - and, in  fact\r\n\r\nthat  will  mean - maybe the incoming Government  may\r\n\r\nwish  to  review  it -  that  we  do  not  make  any\r\n\r\nalteration, at any rate for the time being. We will\r\n\r\nnot  make any change for the time being in  respect\r\n\r\nof the present Teochew broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested, Sir, that it was important that\r\n\r\nbroadcasting  should  be  used  for  cultural   and\r\n\r\neducative  purposes rather than for  entertainment.\r\n\r\nHere  again,  Sir, I pointed out when I  made  this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nannouncement  that  the  object  of  revising   and\r\n\r\nreforming  the  present Chinese broadcasts  was  in\r\n\r\norder  to  be  able  to  give the  opportunity  for\r\n\r\nimproving the educative nature of these broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested that it was important that\r\n\r\nall  listeners should be able to listen in to Radio\r\n\r\nMalaya  in  order to understand what the Government\r\n\r\nwanted  to  give them but I would stress  on  that,\r\n\r\nSir, that the Department of Broadcasting is not  an\r\n\r\ninstrument of Government policy and it  is  not  in\r\n\r\nany  way  a  means whereby any particular political\r\n\r\nparty   which  is  in  power  at  the  time  should\r\n\r\ninfluence   the  electorate  and  those   who   are\r\n\r\nlistening to broadcasts. Its presentation  of  news\r\n\r\nand  other matters should be entirely unbiased  and\r\n\r\nimpartial  and that is what this Department  always\r\n\r\nseeks to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention was made, Sir, of racing broadcasts, I\r\n\r\nthink.   That  has,  I  am  advised,  ceased   some\r\n\r\nconsiderable time ago and has not been renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also suggested by the hon. Member for\r\n\r\nChangi,  that  we  should improve the  broadcasting\r\n\r\nservice  by  increasing the hours of  broadcasting,\r\n\r\nand I think he mentioned the possibility of working\r\n\r\nstaff  in  two  shifts. But, in the  light  of  the\r\n\r\ncriticisms that we have already had from  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Telok Ayer in regard to the expenditure\r\n\r\nunder  this Head, I think any idea of doubling  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  programme staff in order to  provide  a\r\n\r\nlarger  and longer broadcasting service is  clearly\r\n\r\nnot in the picture, at any rate at the present time\r\n\r\nand  having regard to the standstill nature of the 1959 Budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude, Sir, by referring, firstly, to\r\n\r\nthe matter of licence fees to which the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor Tiong Bahru drew attention. I have no doubt  he\r\n\r\nis  certainly correct in saying that radio sets are\r\n\r\nbeing sold every day, and if they are being used in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  then we hold that the owners  of  those\r\n\r\nradio sets should take out listeners' licences, and\r\n\r\nI  hope  that the listeners themselves would accept\r\n\r\ntheir proper obligation in this respect, because it\r\n\r\nis  not  at all easy to chase after and detect  the\r\n\r\nunlicensed   receivers.  But  what  can   be   done\r\n\r\ncertainly will be done and is being done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also point out to the House, in relation\r\n\r\nto  the  expenditure of this Department  for  1959,\r\n\r\nthat  the  estimates do in fact show  a  saving  of\r\n\r\nroughly $450,000 on the estimates for 1958.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, there are only five\r\n\r\nminutes  to go and I wish to be correct.

Many  of  them\r\n\r\ncannot read and write.

Singapore is a small city.\r\n\r\nWe  were formerly spending a lot on naval and other\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nservices. At that time, Singapore was most advanced\r\n\r\npolitically  and we thought that it  would  be  the\r\n\r\nfirst to achieve independence, as we had the system\r\n\r\nof  elected Members whose number was increased from\r\n\r\n6  to  9,  and  now  to  25.

The burden of defence,  or\r\n\r\nthe responsibility for defence, is not on us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the last Budget sitting, it was I and\r\n\r\nmany others on this side of the House who said that\r\n\r\nall  naval expenses should be scrapped. We  made  a\r\n\r\nlot of arguments and, with the reasons advanced, we\r\n\r\nare glad that this is no more our responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the modern world, a small city like\r\n\r\nSingapore, in the event of an attack, cannot  stand\r\n\r\nalone  or defend itself singlehanded. Even the  big\r\n\r\ncountries -  both  the Western democracies  and  the\r\n\r\nRussian  bloc - have pacts with other  countries.  No\r\n\r\none  can simply stand alone today. Recently we have\r\n\r\nseen  what has happened in Egypt, Jordan,  and  the\r\n\r\nLebanon  and many other countries where the  United\r\n\r\nNations  have  come  to  their  aid.  Then  is   it\r\n\r\nworthwhile  to  have  such a heavy  expenditure  on\r\n\r\ndefence services? One thing is certain, and that is\r\n\r\nthat we cannot defend ourselves from air attack  or\r\n\r\nany  other attack. We are a small city and  have  a\r\n\r\nsmall population. Then why spend so much on defence\r\n\r\nservices  and  also on the capital  cost?  I  would\r\n\r\nadvise the incoming Government to scrap the maximum\r\n\r\nexpenditure. After all, the Budget stands for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthree  or  four months and no more. The framers  of\r\n\r\nthe Budget will not be there too!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might explain about the cutting of salaries, if\r\n\r\nyou  will  permit me. What I said this  morning  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  is an honour to be elected Chief Minister\r\n\r\nor  a  Minister  but what is the use  of  replacing\r\n\r\nexpatriates who came from 8,000 miles with our  own\r\n\r\nmen  if our own men cannot reduce the burden on the\r\n\r\ntaxpayers? That is the gist. For, after  all,  Sir,\r\n\r\neach  one  of us knows what is our expenditure.  If\r\n\r\nanybody  brags, income tax returns and prewar,  war\r\n\r\ntax  returns  are there. Death duties  records  are\r\n\r\nthere - what they inherited and what they have. So  I\r\n\r\nthink there should only be reasonable salaries  for\r\n\r\nour elected Ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Sir, I rise to speak on\r\n\r\ndefence,  but the line I am taking and  the  course\r\n\r\nadopted  is  quite different from  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTelok Ayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to me it is a sheer waste of time to argue\r\n\r\nand debate about how much money is spent on defence\r\n\r\nand  on  which item we should keep on  spending.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to ask this House whether the time  has\r\n\r\nnow  arrived  for us to consider whether  Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  be defended, and also whether Singapore should\r\n\r\nbe  defended. In other words, Sir, whether to  take\r\n\r\nthe  course to make Singapore an open city with  no\r\n\r\nfear of any type of war or the threat of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, merger with the Federation seems very far\r\n\r\naway.  Singapore has to look after herself. And  if\r\n\r\nSingapore can be made an open city, Sir, I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  that we have much to worry. As a Switzerland\r\n\r\nof   the  East,  Singapore  can  naturally  attract\r\n\r\nwealthy  investors who will know that Singapore  is\r\n\r\nthe  safest place in the world besides Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIt  is an open city without any fear of war or  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthreat of war. Sir, I am supporting this motion and\r\n\r\neven  our new Constitution clearly states that  the\r\n\r\ndefence  of  Singapore  is  in  the  hands  of  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government.  Therefore,  why  should  we\r\n\r\nstill have an item called Defence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I purposely want to emphasise that we have\r\n\r\nnow  arrived at the stage Where the Government will\r\n\r\nwork  towards  a policy to make Singapore  an  open\r\n\r\ncity  as  well as a free port. Whether merger  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation is going to be a reality or not  is\r\n\r\nof secondary importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nlooking  through the Defence Estimates, I  am  very\r\n\r\nglad  to observe that the item for the purchase  of\r\n\r\nthree  minesweepers amounting to  $15  million  has\r\n\r\nbeen  deleted.  For two successive  years,  I  have\r\n\r\nattacked   that  item  as  being  unrealistic   and\r\n\r\nunnecessary,  since  minesweeping  is  an  obsolete\r\n\r\nmethod  of warfare. I said that the money could  be\r\n\r\nmuch  better spent on social services.  I  am  glad\r\n\r\nthat  at  last my views and criticisms  have  taken\r\n\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the items that have been singled out for\r\n\r\nattack  by  the Member for Telok Ayer, I  see  that\r\n\r\nmost  of them are for salaries for our local people\r\n\r\nwho have been recruited into the Royal Malayan Navy\r\n\r\nand  the  Singapore Battalion. Some of the expenses\r\n\r\nare  for  the  salaries of expatriate officers  and\r\n\r\nthey must, I am sure, be for a very limited period.\r\n\r\nThey  will  only be engaged when it  is  absolutely\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnecessary for the instruction of our local boys.  I\r\n\r\ndo not agree that we should pare down on a means of\r\n\r\nemployment for our local lads, as we know that  the\r\n\r\nproblem of unemployment is terribly acute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think on the whole the items are realistic\r\n\r\nand I support the expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, defence for\r\n\r\na  country,  no  matter how small it  might  be  is\r\n\r\nnecessary;  but  what i would like  to  touch  upon\r\n\r\ntoday, Sir, is Civil Defence. The Civil Defence, as\r\n\r\nyou  will see, Sir, has done good work not only  in\r\n\r\nwar  time  but  also  in peace time.  We  have  had\r\n\r\nreports  time  and  again that whenever  there  are\r\n\r\nfires and other disasters which need help, they are\r\n\r\nalways  there the first in service and the last  to\r\n\r\nbe  recognised. When I say \"recognised\", Sir,  like\r\n\r\nother services, they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill  have  honours bestowed on them - Long  Service\r\n\r\nMedals,  Meritorious Service Medals and  so  on - but\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Defence get nothing and I am afraid  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has, to a certain extent, overlooked the\r\n\r\ngood  work  done by them. For the past  few  years,\r\n\r\nthey  have been poorly equipped. I was in the Civil\r\n\r\nDefence, Sir, as a top officer for six years. I had\r\n\r\nto  pay  all my expenses. That did not matter,  but\r\n\r\nwhat I am talking about concerns the rank and file,\r\n\r\nSir.  They have had only one uniform since the last\r\n\r\nsix years. I do not know about this year at all. So\r\n\r\nI  would  like Members of this House to  know  that\r\n\r\nwhen  they  say that the Government are extravagant\r\n\r\nin  their expenditure on defence services, they are\r\n\r\nnot right. Government have been most stringent with\r\n\r\ntheir money on civil defence, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to take\r\n\r\nup  the  remarks of the Member for Changi that  the\r\n\r\nonly  and  obvious  solution  to  the  defence   of\r\n\r\nSingapore is to declare it an open city.  It  seems\r\n\r\nto  me  very  much  on a par with the  solution  he\r\n\r\nsuggested  for dealing with the gangsters,  namely,\r\n\r\nthat you should take them aside and pat them on the\r\n\r\nback  and  say,  \"Be good boys in future.\"  if  you\r\n\r\ndeclare  Singapore an open city, the value of  that\r\n\r\ndeclaration does not depend on you. It  depends  on\r\n\r\nthe people who may have designs on the city and, in\r\n\r\nthe  light  of current methods of warfare,  I  very\r\n\r\nmuch  doubt whether that is going to give you  much\r\n\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's policy on defence as a\r\n\r\nwhole  in this Budget is in line with the  rest  of\r\n\r\nthe  Heads of Expenditure; a standstill Budget with\r\n\r\na  certain amount of consolidation, particularly in\r\n\r\nthe  First  Battalion  of  the  Singapore  Infantry\r\n\r\nRegiment.  There  does seem to be some  idea  that,\r\n\r\nwhen  the  new  Constitution comes into  force  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  enjoys self-government,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nsome    radical   chang   in   relation   to   this\r\n\r\nresponsibility.  I suggest, Sir,  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\nmistaken  view.  The  responsibility  for  external\r\n\r\naffairs and for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefence rests now, and has always rested, with  Her\r\n\r\nMajesty's  Government in the United Kingdom.  After\r\n\r\nthe appointed day that responsibility will continue\r\n\r\nto  rest with Her Majesty's Government but she will\r\n\r\nnot thereby he assuming any fresh responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThey  are there already, and it has always been  an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccepted   practice   that  while   Her   Majesty's\r\n\r\nGovernment in the United Kingdom has to accept  the\r\n\r\nstrategic  defence of a number of widely  separated\r\n\r\nterritories  all  over the world, those  particular\r\n\r\nterritories  have  always made  some  contribution,\r\n\r\nhowever  small,  towards looking after  themselves,\r\n\r\nand  Singapore, it seems to me, has a very definite\r\n\r\nintered  craft,  and it is very desirable  that  is\r\n\r\nquite unrealistic to suppose that Singapore can, so\r\n\r\nto  speak,  wash  its hands of the defence  of  the\r\n\r\nisland from external aggression, or whatever it may\r\n\r\nbe,  and  to say that it belongs to somebody  else,\r\n\r\nbecause the people of Singapore have a very genuine\r\n\r\ninterest  in  seeing  that Singapore  is  defended.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if hostilities did break out, it is quite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nclear  that  there would be a number of matters  in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Singapore Government would  be  vitally\r\n\r\nconcerned, such as continuation of supplies.  There\r\n\r\nis no reason to suppose that, in any future war, we\r\n\r\nshould  not have the same type of situation as  has\r\n\r\noccurred  in  the past, indeed it is likely  to  be\r\n\r\nprobably  more  severe,  and  immediately  on   the\r\n\r\noutbreak of war, whether it is conventional weapons\r\n\r\nused  or whether it is nuclear weapons, there would\r\n\r\nundoubtedly   be  an  interruption   of   supplies.\r\n\r\nSupplies  might  be  difficult to  obtain  and  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government would have to  take  whatever\r\n\r\nsteps  were  necessary  to  try  and  ensure   that\r\n\r\nsupplies were brought under Government control  and\r\n\r\nfairly  distributed, and so on. All  those  matters\r\n\r\nwhich come within the internal jurisdiction of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government arising out of a state of  war\r\n\r\nwill  still rest with the Singapore Government  and\r\n\r\nthey will, in the interests of the people, have  to\r\n\r\ntake the necessary steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the size of the contribution made by\r\n\r\nSingapore  towards  its own defence,  the  present\r\n\r\nfigure  rests  at round about 3 per  cent  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nas  against 5 per cent for last year, and I suggest\r\n\r\nthat  no one can reasonably claim that this  is  an\r\n\r\ninordinate proportion of the expenditure under this\r\n\r\nHead,    particularly   bearing   in    mind    the\r\n\r\ncorresponding  percentage of  expenditure  and  the\r\n\r\nburden  which is borne by, for instance, people  in\r\n\r\nthe  United  Kingdom  who have  accepted  and  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  accept  its very much  wider  defence\r\n\r\nresponsibilities.  I  would also  suggest  to  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  that the defence of Singapore is  a  vital\r\n\r\nmatter to the Federation, and if we do as we do one\r\n\r\nday  look  forward to a merger with the Federation,\r\n\r\nit is indeed proper that Singapore should also play\r\n\r\nits part and bring a contribution to that merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members are aware, the Royal Malayan Navy\r\n\r\nhas  been transferred this year and will, from  the\r\n\r\n1st of January, no longer be the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Government. I should mention in that\r\n\r\nconnection  that  there is one  service  which  the\r\n\r\nRoyal  Malayan Navy has provided for  us  in  peace\r\n\r\ntime  while it has been a Singapore Force, and that\r\n\r\nis  acting  in support of the Marine Police.  There\r\n\r\nhave   been  occasions,  and  there  may  well   be\r\n\r\noccasions  in  the  future,  when  our  territorial\r\n\r\nwaters  have  been entered by foreign  gunboats  in\r\n\r\npursuit  of Singapore registered craft, and  it  is\r\n\r\nvery desirable that the Marine Police, who are  not\r\n\r\na  trained fighting force, should have behind  them\r\n\r\nsome  support to deal with situations of that kind.\r\n\r\nThe  Federation  Government have generously  agreed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the  Royal  Malayan  Navy  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nprovide  that  support in so  far  as  their  other\r\n\r\ncommitments permit, but that does mean that we  are\r\n\r\ndependent  on  their  goodwill  and  indeed   their\r\n\r\ncommitments  towards the Federation will  naturally\r\n\r\nincrease,  and  the time which they can  spare  for\r\n\r\nassisting Singapore will correspondingly reduce. I,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  suggest that one of the  matters  which\r\n\r\nthe  incoming  Government may have to  consider  in\r\n\r\nconnection  with  the defence of Singapore  is  the\r\n\r\nneed  for some small regular element in the Malayan\r\n\r\nRoyal Naval Volunteer Reserve for meeting just that\r\n\r\nparticular situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to say a word on the volunteer\r\n\r\nforces, and in this connection I should like to say\r\n\r\nthat  I  know of no foundation whatsoever  for  any\r\n\r\nidea  that  the M.R.N.V.R., or any other  volunteer\r\n\r\nforce is nothing but a centre for drinking, and any\r\n\r\nsuch suggestion is, in my view, a quite unjustified\r\n\r\nslur  on a patriotic body of men who, whatever  the\r\n\r\nmerits  or  demerits of the policy  of  maintaining\r\n\r\nthose  forces, or whatever their military value  or\r\n\r\nlack  of  military value, are devoting their  spare\r\n\r\ntime  very willingly in this way to the service  of\r\n\r\ntheir country. The volunteer forces, Sir, have,  as\r\n\r\nhon.  Members are aware, been now made  subject  to\r\n\r\ncall-up   for   internal  security  purposes   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, they are an additional reserve on  which\r\n\r\nthe  Government can draw in the event of widespread\r\n\r\ninternal disturbances which will, of course,  under\r\n\r\nthe   new  Constitution,  still  remain  the   full\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Singapore Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other aspect of volunteer service to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  would also like to refer. We have  had  a\r\n\r\nnumber  of  debates  in this  House,  sometimes  on\r\n\r\nlegislation,  sometimes on motions, in  which  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  apprehensions have been expressed  as\r\n\r\nregards the youth of this City and the way in which\r\n\r\nthey  are  caught up with the secret societies  and\r\n\r\nthe  way  in which they are inveigled into spending\r\n\r\ntheir time hanging round corners, coffee shops, and\r\n\r\nso  on,  where it is only too easy for them  to  be\r\n\r\ndrawn into bad habits or indeed into crime. In  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  these debates, considerable stress  has\r\n\r\nbeen  laid  on  the  need for finding  some  proper\r\n\r\noutlet  for  the  energies and spare  time  of  our\r\n\r\nyouths,  whether it be in youth clubs or any  other\r\n\r\nform of organisation, and I do suggest to the House\r\n\r\nthat  the  volunteer  forces  in  this  respect  do\r\n\r\nprovide  a very valuable means indeed for  teaching\r\n\r\ndiscipline, self-respect, and a genuine  pride  and\r\n\r\nsense  of  service to their country. There  are  at\r\n\r\npresent, counting the regular and volunteer  forces\r\n\r\ntogether,  something over 9,000 men. Of those,  the\r\n\r\nregular  element  is  a very small  element - 600  or\r\n\r\n700 - and the balance of those 9,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare all volunteers, and I do, as I say, suggest  to\r\n\r\nthe  House  that,  quite apart  from  the  arguable\r\n\r\nmilitary  value  of these forces, in  this  respect\r\n\r\nthey  have  a  very  real value  towards  providing\r\n\r\ntraining for the youths of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member for Telok Ayer, and I think\r\n\r\nin  this he enjoyed the support of the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Changi, suggested that in this day and age  no\r\n\r\none  could  stand alone in matters of defence,  and\r\n\r\nthe  implication  of  that,  if  I  understood  him\r\n\r\ncorrect,  was  to say that since you  cannot  stand\r\n\r\nalone, it is no use doing anything about it at all.\r\n\r\nThere, I entirely disagree with him, Sir. It  seems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto me that is clearly the policy of the ostrich - put\r\n\r\nyour  head in the sand and take no account  of  the\r\n\r\nrealities which are going on around you.  The  true\r\n\r\nanswer  is  that, against the potential  threat  of\r\n\r\noutside  aggression,  there  must  indeed   be   an\r\n\r\nalliance  and  a drawing together of all  the  free\r\n\r\ncountries,  and  that each should take  a  hand  in\r\n\r\nensuring  the defence of the whole to the  best  of\r\n\r\nits ability and resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just conclude, Sir, by associating myself\r\n\r\nwith the tribute paid by one of my hon. friends  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil Defence organization, and to say to  him\r\n\r\nthat  I  realise they could indeed do  better  with\r\n\r\nmore  and with better equipment, the need of  which\r\n\r\nindeed  we  have  very much in  mind,  but  in  the\r\n\r\npresent  state  of our financial  resources  it  is\r\n\r\nunfortunately  one  of those needs  which  have  to\r\n\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

The  revenue\r\n\r\nderived  from  censoring  films  is  estimated   at\r\n\r\n$305,000.  As against this, expenditure is  roughly\r\n\r\n$209,000,  which includes a sum of  about  $108,000\r\n\r\nwhich  is paid to the Federation as their share  of\r\n\r\nthe  revenue,  which means, roughly speaking,  that\r\n\r\neach  country makes a profit of about $100,000  out\r\n\r\nof  censorship fees. Now the Federation is about to\r\n\r\nset  up  their own Board of Censors, which I  think\r\n\r\nwill take place during 1959. Presumably, therefore,\r\n\r\nthis payment to the Federation will not continue to\r\n\r\nbe  made.  If that is so, then the Government  will\r\n\r\nmake  about  $200,000 on this particular operation.\r\n\r\nApart  from the financial side of the question,  we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  know  whether  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ncontemplating  any  change in policy  or  procedure\r\n\r\nwhen censorship is separate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film trade does not feel that it should pay\r\n\r\nthe  existing censorship fees twice,  once  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation and once in Singapore, when the  revenue\r\n\r\nalready  collected  of  $300,000  could  meet   the\r\n\r\nexpenses in both territories. We would like to know\r\n\r\nwhat  arrangements  have been reached  between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  and  ourselves  with  regard  to   this\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr E.

This   is   our\r\n\r\nconfidence in the future. I am not prepared  to  go\r\n\r\ninto  detail into the merits or demerits of  family\r\n\r\nplanning. What I would like to emphasize,  however,\r\n\r\nis the belief, the confidence in the future held by\r\n\r\nthose who oppose family planning. These people have\r\n\r\nbeen termed a conservative type. The supporters  of\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  have  accused  the  opponents  of\r\n\r\nfamily  planning as being ignorant of and blind  to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npresent state of affairs. They say we are blind  to\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  plan  the growth  of  population  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  have argued  that,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nprovide for more hospital beds and more schools for\r\n\r\nour children, family planning is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I put this fact forward. Those who support\r\n\r\nfamily  planning  have  no confidence  in  building\r\n\r\nhospital  beds  and  more  schools.  Why   do   the\r\n\r\nopponents  of  family planning  hold  the  contrary\r\n\r\nview?  Because they have full confidence that  they\r\n\r\ncan build more hospitals and schools to accommodate\r\n\r\ntheir children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have good reasons for my confidence in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  especially at this juncture when everybody\r\n\r\nis  shouting  for a merger with the  Federation.  I\r\n\r\nwish   to  stress  that  the  opponents  of  family\r\n\r\nplanning  have  good reasons to  believe  that  the\r\n\r\nfuture is in their hands. Sir, we who oppose family\r\n\r\nplanning  can run our own affairs. We  can  provide\r\n\r\nfor   our  means  if  and  when  we  attain   self-government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population has not risen much since the\r\n\r\ncolonial  regime.  Now that we are  reaching  self-government, we are beginning to lose confidence  in\r\n\r\nourselves. We say we must stop our population  from\r\n\r\nincreasing  because our future is not bright.  With\r\n\r\nthe  mounting  increase  in population,  we  cannot\r\n\r\ntackle our social problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I used to advise young persons who liked to\r\n\r\ncome to me for advice as to whether they should get\r\n\r\nmarried  or not. I simply asked them this question:\r\n\r\n\"Do  you believe in family planning or not? If  you\r\n\r\nbelieve  in  family planning, you  had  better  not\r\n\r\nmarry. But if you do not believe in it, you may get\r\n\r\nmarried.\"  The reason is simple, Sir. A  young  man\r\n\r\nwho  decides to get married has full confidence  in\r\n\r\nhimself. He believes that he has reached the  stage\r\n\r\nwhere he can do everything himself. He may even lie\r\n\r\nto his fiancee that he can pull down a mountain. We\r\n\r\nknow  a man usually likes to lie to his loved  one.\r\n\r\nHe  wants to show that he can do everything to  win\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nher heart and get married.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is the sort of\r\n\r\nconversation  we  should hear in a  young  nation,\r\n\r\n\"For  three  or four years and until I  receive  a\r\n\r\nsalary of $250 we must not get a baby\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A young nation must have vigorous and\r\n\r\nextraordinary confidence in herself, just  like  a\r\n\r\nrising  sun from the East. As a young and vigorous\r\n\r\nnation,  we know that the future is very dark.  We\r\n\r\nknow the population of Singapore is one and a half\r\n\r\nmillion.  We know it is only 225 square miles  and\r\n\r\nvery small. If one knows Manhattan Island which is\r\n\r\nin New York City one will not say Singapore is too\r\n\r\nsmall to have one and a half million people.  What\r\n\r\nis  the size of Manhattan Island? It is very small\r\n\r\nand  yet it can carry millions of people. I do not\r\n\r\nthink the Americans find that family planning is a\r\n\r\n\"must\"   and   so  must  be  subsidised   by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   No,  Sir,  even   in   Britain   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  do  not  subsidise  family   planning.\r\n\r\nTherefore, why should it be in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will call him, who supports the Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association in Singapore, a  coward  who\r\n\r\nhas  no  confidence in the future or no confidence\r\n\r\nof a merger with the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I wish to touch on the\r\n\r\nFamily  Planning Association itself is  that  this\r\n\r\nAssociation  is one of the most distinguished  and\r\n\r\nnoble   organisations.  Judging  by  the  personal\r\n\r\nwealth of its office-bearers, we know that  it  is\r\n\r\none  of the wealthiest organisations in Singapore.\r\n\r\nTo  many of them, $100,000 is just petty cash.  It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndoes  not  come  up  to the cost  of  a  piece  of\r\n\r\njewellery or a diamond ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if all the office-bearers of this\r\n\r\nAssociation  sincerely  believe  that  they   must\r\n\r\ncontribute  something towards the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore, they should  not  come  and\r\n\r\nbother  the  House by asking for money.  They  can\r\n\r\neasily get the money from their husbands, Sir. If\r\n\r\nyou  want  to  put  it as a challenge,  there  are\r\n\r\nnumerous  charitable  organisations  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  render  a  more  tremendous  and  wonderful\r\n\r\nservice than the Family Planning Association. Last\r\n\r\nyear, I mentioned the Blue Cross\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation. It wants to be connected with welfare\r\n\r\nwork. Any fires or any disasters that happen,  you\r\n\r\ncan  immediately see Blue Cross officials reaching\r\n\r\nthe  place  much  earlier than the Social  Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment   people,  Sir.  They  contribute   and\r\n\r\ncollect    not   only   cash   but   also    other\r\n\r\ngoods - foodstuffs,   clothing,   everything.   They\r\n\r\nprovide even cooked meals for the victims.  And  I\r\n\r\nhave  not  heard  of  the Blue  Cross  Association\r\n\r\ncoming  to the Assembly and saying, \"You  see  our\r\n\r\nrecord.  We served the Geylang fire victims.  This\r\n\r\nis  what  we give. Therefore, the Government  must\r\n\r\nsubsidise us.\" They do not. The officials  of  the\r\n\r\nBlue   Cross  Association  know  they   are   just\r\n\r\nperforming their duties and that it is up to them,\r\n\r\nthe office-bearers of the Association, to look for\r\n\r\nthe  donors,  not  only  in  cash,  but  also   in\r\n\r\nfoodstuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, I strongly oppose the Government\r\n\r\ngranting  another $100,000 to the Family  Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation,  especially in view of our  financial\r\n\r\nhardship at this juncture, and more especially  as\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education has been forced to cut\r\n\r\ndown  a  lot of things, like the building of  more\r\n\r\nschools. Let him first build more schools and then\r\n\r\nGovernment   can   indulge  in   the   luxury   of\r\n\r\ncontributing $100,000 to this Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, \"That the sum to\r\n\r\nbe  allotted  for  Head 25 be reduced  by  $10  in\r\n\r\nrespect of subhead 31 therein.\" Honourable Members\r\n\r\nwill  have noticed that the hon.

I\r\n\r\nthink we have to satisfy the taxpayers who pay into\r\n\r\nthe  revenue  fund and their objections  should  be\r\n\r\nupheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, if the Government has a clinic\r\n\r\nfor  consultation on this subject, that will  serve\r\n\r\nthe purpose and satisfy the taxpayers because it is\r\n\r\npart  of  the health services for giving advice  or\r\n\r\ntreating the people coming into the clinics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, is it wise to hand over $100,000 to a\r\n\r\nprivate association over which the Government  have\r\n\r\nwry little control? They can spend the money in any\r\n\r\nway  they  like.  I do not question  their  motive,\r\n\r\ntheir  integrity  or  their honesty.  But  you  are\r\n\r\nparting with the taxpayers' money and giving it  to\r\n\r\na  private body which is doing some work  in  their\r\n\r\nown way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has hospitals and clinics, and the\r\n\r\nbest  solution  to the problem is  to  establish  a\r\n\r\nclinic  for this purpose and not to give a cent  to\r\n\r\nthis Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the hon.

It was very nice of the Hon. the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education to announce later that those\r\n\r\nwho   passed  would  be  admitted  into   secondary\r\n\r\nschools,  but for those who failed, there is  still\r\n\r\nno solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Family Planning Association is doing its\r\n\r\nbest,  and  although  it may  not,  as  the  people\r\n\r\nexpect, stop the growth of population, it has, to a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent,  prevented the  multiplication  of\r\n\r\nchildren  in Singapore. We also know of the  crimes\r\n\r\nthat  exist here and that, I think, Sir, is due  to\r\n\r\nthe  fact that we have too many children who  could\r\n\r\nnot  get  the facility of having a good  education.\r\n\r\nFirst,  because the Government could not give  them\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat   facility,  because  they  could  not   build\r\n\r\nsufficient  schools; and, secondly,  their  parents\r\n\r\nare  poor  and  there are a lot  of  them  who  are\r\n\r\nunemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I feel it is a sad case today that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  are not rich enough to give the  Family\r\n\r\nPlanning  Association more money and they  have  to\r\n\r\nreduce  the amount to $100,000.

These  visits\r\n\r\nare  different  from  the actual  number  of  women\r\n\r\nattending.  Supposing one woman  visited  a  clinic\r\n\r\ntwice  in  a year, therefore only 10,000 women  had\r\n\r\nbeen  to the clinics; but I am prepared to take  it\r\n\r\nthat the 20,000 visits were made by 20,000 women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my estimation I think there were in 1957\r\n\r\nat  least  200,000 married women. So you  will  see\r\n\r\nthat 180,000 of them did not go to the clinics  for\r\n\r\nadvice  or  treatment.

Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to say that some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsections  of  the taxpayers do not approve  of  the\r\n\r\nspending  of  public  revenue,  part  of  which  is\r\n\r\nderived  from  them, because it  is  against  their\r\n\r\nconscience, Sir, is rather confusing an issue which\r\n\r\nshould be judged purely from its economic angle. It\r\n\r\nis  true  that some sections of the public may  not\r\n\r\napprove  the  grant  for family planning  purposes,\r\n\r\nbecause  family planning is against their religion.\r\n\r\nIt  is  also  true that pig rearing is against  the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreligion  of Muslims, and therefore it  is  logical\r\n\r\nthat  they  will  not  approve  any  grant  to  the\r\n\r\nVeterinary services which assist in pig-rearing for\r\n\r\nfood purposes. Similarly, those who are against the\r\n\r\ntaking  of  life  for  any purpose,  even  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  eating, will oppose any grant  to  the\r\n\r\nFisheries Department because this will be used  for\r\n\r\nfishermen to catch fish\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  food purposes. So will the same persons oppose\r\n\r\na grant for dog-shooters, which also appears in the\r\n\r\nEstimates.  Then again I take it that  the  Muslims\r\n\r\nwill  probably  oppose utilising any  part  of  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  derived from liquors, because the drinking\r\n\r\nof alcohol is against their religion, and therefore\r\n\r\nany  part of the revenue derived from alcohol which\r\n\r\nis  sold for drinking purposes should logically  be\r\n\r\nopposed  by  them, if that revenue  is  applied  to\r\n\r\npurposes  which  are of benefit to the  schools  to\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Muslims go. Therefore, I say that  that\r\n\r\nissue should not be confused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A government runs the country not on the basis of\r\n\r\nthe likes and dislikes of any particular section of\r\n\r\nthe  community, but rather on the good of the whole\r\n\r\ncommunity  as  such. Personally, I  have  no  views\r\n\r\neither way on family planning. I do not support it,\r\n\r\nneither  do  I  oppose it, but I  think  it  is  an\r\n\r\neconomic necessity in the circumstances that we are\r\n\r\nin today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to that, the Member for Changi said\r\n\r\nthat  Singapore  is not too small to  hold  a  much\r\n\r\nbigger  population than it is holding now,  and  he\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  Island of Manhattan which  holds  a\r\n\r\nmuch bigger population. That is quite true, Sir. In\r\n\r\nsize,  Singapore  may not be too  small.  It  could\r\n\r\nprobably  hold  two or three times the  population,\r\n\r\nbut  what  the Member has not foreseen is that  the\r\n\r\neconomic necessities of the situation dictate  that\r\n\r\nthe  population of Singapore should be  limited  to\r\n\r\nthe  size  where  our economic resources  would  be\r\n\r\ncapable of taking care of that population.  Now  he\r\n\r\nhas many times spoken on our economic difficulties:\r\n\r\nthe  unemployment problem which is growing  day  by\r\n\r\nday;  and also, Sir, hon. Members on the Opposition\r\n\r\nside have belaboured constantly Government spending\r\n\r\nso  much  money that, as a consequence,  taxes  are\r\n\r\nraised,  because the money has to  be  found.  That\r\n\r\nmoney  has to be found for what? For providing  the\r\n\r\nnecessary  educational, medical  and  other  social\r\n\r\nservices for an increasing population. Now if  that\r\n\r\npopulation goes on increasing and we have  not  the\r\n\r\nresources to provide for that increase, what arises\r\n\r\nthen? You will get a lot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhooligans    and   vagrants   amongst   school-age\r\n\r\nchildren, because Government cannot provide enough\r\n\r\neducational  facilities, and so on, and  you  will\r\n\r\nget,  as during the Occupation period, sick people\r\n\r\nlying  in  the streets. I am sure the hon.  Member\r\n\r\nmust  have seen them during the Occupation period,\r\n\r\nbecause  there were not enough medical  facilities\r\n\r\nto  cater  for  them. Therefore,  family  planning\r\n\r\nbecomes an economic necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is not the size of Singapore that is\r\n\r\ndictating   family  planning  but   the   economic\r\n\r\nnecessity.  Sir,  how has that economic  necessity\r\n\r\narisen?  The  Member  for Tanjong  Pagar  is  very\r\n\r\nclever in his analysis of any situation, but he is\r\n\r\nnot  here  at  the moment to give us  a  brilliant\r\n\r\nanalysis.   The  economic  necessity  has   arisen\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this: God made earth for  mankind  to\r\n\r\ninherit.  But does mankind inherit the  earth,  as\r\n\r\nmankind?  It  does not. Today we find  a  part  of\r\n\r\nmankind has taken big chunks of the earth - hundreds\r\n\r\nof  thousands of square miles - and reserved it  for\r\n\r\nthemselves,  leaving  the other  part  of  teeming\r\n\r\nhumanity  in  countries  which  are  not  able  to\r\n\r\nsupport  them:  for instance, Java, China,  India,\r\n\r\nJapan,  and  so on. Yet we have examples  of  vast\r\n\r\ncontinents  having a population that is  not  even\r\n\r\none-tenth of the continent's capacity to hold that\r\n\r\npopulation - all  reserved  for  certain  groups  of\r\n\r\npeople  who  thought that God  intended  that  the\r\n\r\nearth should be inherited by them only and not  by\r\n\r\nthe  others. Now that is the real reason  for  our\r\n\r\neconomic plight today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Australia recently, I was asked by\r\n\r\nmany people, \"What do you think if the immigration\r\n\r\nquotas are relaxed for Asians?\" I said, \"It  is  a\r\n\r\njolly good idea. If you do that, I am sure that  a\r\n\r\nlot  of  the  antagonism which some of the  Asians\r\n\r\nhave against Australians will be removed.\" I think\r\n\r\nthat  is  the  background to the whole  situation - that the teeming humanity in certain parts of  the\r\n\r\nworld  is confined within small land masses  which\r\n\r\nhave  not  the  resources  to  provide  for  them,\r\n\r\nwhereas  vast tracts of land - hundreds of thousands\r\n\r\nof  square  miles, which can hold  ten  times  the\r\n\r\npopulation that they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow - are  lying fallow; and therefore if the  world\r\n\r\ncan come to an agreement whereby these vast tracts\r\n\r\nof land can be opened up to the teeming masses who\r\n\r\ncannot provide for themselves, because their  land\r\n\r\ncannot  provide enough resources, then we  do  not\r\n\r\nneed  any  family planning anywhere in the  world.\r\n\r\nBut  until that happens, it is necessary for small\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries like Singapore with limited resources to\r\n\r\ntry  and limit their population, because there  is\r\n\r\nno  other  way out of these economic difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe well-off countries have to realise that sooner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  later a situation is going to be brought about\r\n\r\nwhere  they  will have to open up and they  cannot\r\n\r\nkeep  their  doors closed. In the meanwhile,  they\r\n\r\nare  trying  to  put off that evil day  by  giving\r\n\r\nassistance under this plan and that plan,  and  so\r\n\r\non. It is all very well - as I said to somebody, \"I\r\n\r\nhave not come to the United States to beg. If  you\r\n\r\ngive  us assistance, it will be as equals, but  no\r\n\r\nbegging  from  anybody.\" They  have  realised  the\r\n\r\nsituation  and they are trying to avoid  the  evil\r\n\r\nday.  I  do not know how long that can be averted,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  exercising the minds of  many  Asians\r\n\r\ntoday. Hence this bitterness today amongst certain\r\n\r\nclasses  of  Asians. The only way by  which  these\r\n\r\nvast  lands could be opened up is by going to war,\r\n\r\nand  we  want to avoid war at the moment,  because\r\n\r\nwar is not going to benefit anybody today - not with\r\n\r\nhydrogen  and  atom  bombs being  let  loose.  All\r\n\r\nhumanity  will suffer or be killed if they  go  to\r\n\r\nwar.  Therefore, the only way for us to do  is  to\r\n\r\nlimit  our population until such time as the other\r\n\r\npeople  see reason and realise and open  up  their\r\n\r\ncountries themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hold no brief for the Family Planning\r\n\r\nAssociation,  but  that is  the  only  Association\r\n\r\ntoday doing such work; and because it is the  only\r\n\r\nAssociation and because Government is not directly\r\n\r\ngiving any family planning assistance, that is why\r\n\r\nit  has to give a grant to that Association. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know whether the money is being wisely  spent\r\n\r\nor  not. I have not gone into the details  of  how\r\n\r\nthe  Association works, but because it is the only\r\n\r\nAssociation,  there  is  no  other  way  out   for\r\n\r\nGovernment but to give it a grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder\r\n\r\nhow  many  of us know this Chinese proverb \"Cutting\r\n\r\nthe  foot  to suit the shoes.\" Suppose  a  boy  has\r\n\r\ngrown  up very quickly, and he tells \"Pa, my  shoes\r\n\r\nare  too small.\" And then his father replies,  \"Cut\r\n\r\nout  your  d - toes to fit the shoes.\" Do  you  think\r\n\r\nthat that is the attitude for the father to take?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

I\r\n\r\nsaid,  \"Cut short your foot and then you  can  suit\r\n\r\nyour shoes. Your foot is too big. Therefore cut  it\r\n\r\nout.  Papa will be able to save money. There is  no\r\n\r\nneed  to buy a pair of new shoes.\" Sir, we must  be\r\n\r\ngrateful  to the Minister for Education for  having\r\n\r\ngiven   us  wonderful  figures  concerning   school\r\n\r\nbuildings  and how much they will cost. I  am  also\r\n\r\nvery  grateful  to  the Minister for  Commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry. This is the first time he spoke  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  as  an  expert  on mankind!  He  gave  us  a\r\n\r\nclassification  of  mankind; he  talked  about  the\r\n\r\nshortage of land and this and that. But I am  sorry\r\n\r\nto  say that both the Ministers show that they have\r\n\r\nno  courage  to face the future. They also  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  the  courage  to  face  a  merger  with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya. We are going  to  have  vast\r\n\r\nlands  very soon. They also do not have the courage\r\n\r\nto  face  the  advancement of science.  Sir,  human\r\n\r\nbeings  have  succeeded in conquering space.  Human\r\n\r\nbeings  have been able to produce millions of  tons\r\n\r\nof explosives to kill human beings. So it is only a\r\n\r\nmatter of policy - how to divert the wonderful  brain\r\n\r\nof  man  into  productive rather  than  destructive\r\n\r\nchannels.  Then the population question can  easily\r\n\r\nbe  solved.  If you have kept in very  close  touch\r\n\r\nwith  British economic progress, I am sure you will\r\n\r\nknow that they have discovered a means whereby they\r\n\r\ncould   extract   energy  from  sea   water.   That\r\n\r\ndiscovery, I think, is a year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nold.  It  is called Zeta. If we are able to extract\r\n\r\nenergy  from  sea  water instead of  from  fuel  or\r\n\r\nfirewood why should we worry about the future? If a\r\n\r\nresponsible  parent has the courage and  confidence\r\n\r\nto  provide all the necessities for his family  why\r\n\r\nshould he worry about the future? He will not  say,\r\n\r\nif  his  family keeps on getting bigger and bigger,\r\n\r\n\"Cut down the expenditure on clothing. Cut down the\r\n\r\nfood  expenses, because your daddy's income is only\r\n\r\n$200  a month.\" Or \"Because another baby is coming,\r\n\r\ntherefore there will be extra expenditure on milk.\"\r\n\r\nIf  the  parent thinks like this, if  he  does  not\r\n\r\nthink of any other means to try to solve the family\r\n\r\nproblem;  if he just only hopes that the  new  baby\r\n\r\ndoes  not suck milk; if he just waits for his other\r\n\r\nsons and daughters to cut down their food ration in\r\n\r\norder to save on food, then he has no confidence in\r\n\r\nhimself. It is not the right attitude to take  that\r\n\r\nbecause his salary will not be increased until next\r\n\r\nyear, therefore he cannot afford to have a baby,  a\r\n\r\nnew  member  of  the family this year.  That  is  a\r\n\r\ndefensive attitude. I do not think it is the  right\r\n\r\nattitude  for every responsible man who  should  be\r\n\r\nable to shoulder the burden of having a family.  On\r\n\r\nthis moral ground I strongly oppose the grant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R.
