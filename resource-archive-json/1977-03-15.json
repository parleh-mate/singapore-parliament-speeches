All expenditure  items  under  each\r\n\r\nprogramme will be arranged according to projects  and\r\n\r\nactivities.  Since each programme will  constitute  a\r\n\r\nseparate   subhead,  Ministries   will   have   great\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  reallocate expenditure  within  each\r\n\r\nprogramme to make the best possible use of the  funds\r\n\r\nto achieve the objectives of the programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all this implies that in estimating\r\n\r\nexpenditure requirements, Ministries submit proposals\r\n\r\non  the  basis of performance. For example, for  road\r\n\r\nconstruction, estimates will have to be based on  the\r\n\r\ntotal length of roads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  built and the cost per unit run and how these\r\n\r\ncompare against past costs and achievements and  what\r\n\r\nthe  targets  for  the  new  year  represent  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  total  5-year plan and  other  costs  and\r\n\r\nbenefits data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure side, Ministries will have to\r\n\r\nmonitor expenditure from the point of view of results\r\n\r\nand  whether alternative means cannot be found to cut\r\n\r\ncosts  and improve, productivity. Because there  will\r\n\r\nbe  greater flexibility, there will be less delays in\r\n\r\nchanging  the  nature and content of expenditures  to\r\n\r\nmeet  changed  conditions. For  example,  within  the\r\n\r\nconstraints  of their manpower budget, each  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill be able to employ more staff or less staff on  a\r\n\r\nparticular programme if conditions require this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, these changes will require quite\r\n\r\nradical  changes in the mental attitude of the  civil\r\n\r\nservice. There will have to be a greater awareness of\r\n\r\ncost-benefit and cost-effective criteria. There  will\r\n\r\nhave  to be a greater emphasis on the correlation  of\r\n\r\nfinancial  requirements with objectives and  targets.\r\n\r\nThe  civil  service will have to develop  performance\r\n\r\nindicators, norms, standards and historical data  for\r\n\r\nestimating   budgetary   requirements.   For   actual\r\n\r\nexpenditure  the  civil service  will  have  to  find\r\n\r\neffective ways of achieving the objectives or targets\r\n\r\nof  their Ministry's programmes. Finally, at the  end\r\n\r\nof  the financial year, performance will have  to  be\r\n\r\nmeasured and evaluated. The evaluation of performance\r\n\r\n(the  performance annual review) will be an  integral\r\n\r\npart  of  the  budgetary system,  because  this  will\r\n\r\nenable  the  assessment to be made for the  following\r\n\r\nyear  of  the  size of funds to be allocated  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  performance. In view  of  the  nature  and\r\n\r\ncomplexity of Government activities, much effort will\r\n\r\nbe  required  to  devise systems of  measurement  and\r\n\r\nrefinements  of performance indicators and  norms  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  procedures for evaluation  and  assessment.\r\n\r\nAction has already been taken to explain to the civil\r\n\r\nservice  the  new system and to train those  officers\r\n\r\ndirectly  involved in the budgetary  process  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistries  and  Departments.

The   major  problems  and   difficulties\r\n\r\nassociated  with the system have been identified  and\r\n\r\nin  the  second  and  third  rounds  of  discussions,\r\n\r\nsolutions  and various compromises were  worked  out.\r\n\r\nWhen  the  FY 77 Budget has been approved, a  similar\r\n\r\nexercise  will  be done to recast  it  into  the  new\r\n\r\nformat.  This  will  give the civil  service  further\r\n\r\nexperience  with the new system and hopefully  enable\r\n\r\nthe  framing of the FY 78 Budget to be made  properly\r\n\r\nand in time for the next financial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENTS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Assessment of benefits)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance what benefits Singapore has derived from\r\n\r\nthe  many  double taxation agreements concluded  with\r\n\r\nother  countries; how are the benefits assessed;  and\r\n\r\nwhether  a  similar agreement will be concluded  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, it is easy to understand that\r\n\r\nthe   inflow  of  funds,  investments  and  technical\r\n\r\nexpertise to Singapore from another country would  be\r\n\r\ngreatly  discouraged if full taxes have  to  be  paid\r\n\r\naccording  to  the  laws of both  countries.  In  the\r\n\r\nabsence  of  any  agreement otherwise,  income  which\r\n\r\narises and is taxed in Singapore and is then remitted\r\n\r\nhome  by a foreign company would still be subject  to\r\n\r\ntax  in  its  own country. At prevailing  income  tax\r\n\r\nrates,  such  cumulative taxation  by  two  countries\r\n\r\nwould  be  prohibitive.  It  would  completely  deter\r\n\r\nforeign investment in Singapore. The converse is also\r\n\r\ntrue  for  Singapore companies which have  plans  for\r\n\r\nsubstantial investments overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bilateral tax treaties to avoid this situation,\r\n\r\ndouble taxation is eliminated through full or partial\r\n\r\ntax  credit  or  exemption on  interests,  royalties,\r\n\r\ndividends, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important feature found in bilateral tax\r\n\r\ntreaties   between   Singapore  and   the   developed\r\n\r\ncountries  is  \"tax  sparing\". This  is  a  means  of\r\n\r\nensuring that the tax on the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprofits  of foreign-owned companies foregone  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment through various tax incentive measures  is\r\n\r\n\"spared\" from tax by the foreign government.  Without\r\n\r\nsuch  bilateral  treaties,  incentives  such  as  tax\r\n\r\nholiday  benefits granted to such companies could  be\r\n\r\nnullified  if the foreign country should unilaterally\r\n\r\ndecide to increase its tax by an amount equivalent to\r\n\r\nthe tax remitted by the Singapore Government as a tax\r\n\r\nincentive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the avoidance of double taxation, tax\r\n\r\ntreaties also contribute to the prevention of  fiscal\r\n\r\nevasion.  As  a  company's books and records  in  one\r\n\r\ncountry   are  generally  not  available  to  another\r\n\r\ncountry,  effective control is only possible  if  the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries agree on the exchange of  information.\r\n\r\nTax treaties therefore invariably have provisions for\r\n\r\nthe prevention of tax evasion and for the exchange of\r\n\r\nfiscal information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concluded avoidance of double taxation\r\n\r\nagreements  with  all  the major  EEC  countries  and\r\n\r\nJapan.   In  ASEAN,  agreements  with  Thailand   and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  are in force, while an agreement  with  the\r\n\r\nPhilippines was recently initialled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no simple method of assessing the benefits\r\n\r\nwhich  Singapore  derives  from  the  conclusion   of\r\n\r\navoidance  of double taxation agreements, but  it  is\r\n\r\nsignificant  to  note  that it  was  only  after  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  of tax treaties with Germany. Netherlands\r\n\r\nand  Japan that big multi-national corporations  from\r\n\r\nthese  three  countries such as Rollei,  Philips  and\r\n\r\nMitsubishi  established themselves  in  Singapore  in\r\n\r\nresponse   to  the  various  tax  incentive  measures\r\n\r\ngranted  by  the  Government. The tax  treaties  with\r\n\r\nthese  countries ensure that these benefits  are  not\r\n\r\neroded   through  increased  taxation  by  the   home\r\n\r\ncountries.  Rollei  Singapore  Private  Limited   has\r\n\r\ninvested  $106  million,  Philips  Singapore  Private\r\n\r\nLimited  $45  million and Mitsubishi Singapore  Heavy\r\n\r\nIndustries  Private Limited $110 million as  at  June\r\n\r\n1976.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal benefits flowing from tax treaties are\r\n\r\nthe  encouragement  of  the  inflow  of  capital  and\r\n\r\ntechnical  expertise. In the process, local technical\r\n\r\nand   managerial   skills  are  upgraded   and   more\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities are provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary discussions were held in Djakarta in\r\n\r\nNovember 1973, on a Double Taxation Agreement between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Indonesia.

We\r\n\r\nwould  welcome an early agreement with  Indonesia  as\r\n\r\nthis  would  contribute to expansion  of  intra-ASEAN\r\n\r\ntrade  and would encourage greater investments  among\r\n\r\nmember states. However, pending the conclusion  of  a\r\n\r\ntax treaty with Indonesia, Singapore grants exemption\r\n\r\nfrom  tax  on  income derived from  certain  approved\r\n\r\nSingapore   investments  in  Indonesia  which   enjoy\r\n\r\npioneer status or tax holidays in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE AIRPORT DUTY-FREE EMPORIUM</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Sale of Government's equity)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance what is the rationale behind the sale  of\r\n\r\n31  per  cent of the Government's equity  holding  in\r\n\r\nSingapore Airport Duty-Free Emporium Private  Limited\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  Airlines Limited;  and  what  are  the\r\n\r\nbenefits to the Government from that transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir, I do not consider it\r\n\r\nappropriate, as a rule, that I should be called  upon\r\n\r\nto  explain  operational  decisions  on  investments,\r\n\r\nparticularly where they involve transactions  between\r\n\r\none Government company and another.

There\r\n\r\nwas  such  an incident not long ago where a  soldier,\r\n\r\nbecause  of  personal affairs, had  gone  beyond  the\r\n\r\nbounds of a soldier, Although such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninstances  are rare, it is a matter that worries  us.\r\n\r\nMy  question is: after two years of military life  in\r\n\r\nthe  camps whether these youngsters have been  taught\r\n\r\nthe   proper   attitudes   towards   life, personal\r\n\r\nbehaviour, good discipline, and a civic sense so that\r\n\r\nthey  are  more disciplined, more matured and  better\r\n\r\nbehaved. This is a very important matter that  merits\r\n\r\nthe serious attention of all concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise three questions to the\r\n\r\nMinister.   First,   will   the   Minister   consider\r\n\r\nabolishing the decision to enlist women into national\r\n\r\nservice, although the actual date has not been fixed?\r\n\r\nAs  it  is now, we are able to recruit women  by  the\r\n\r\n\"voluntary  and  open method\". So is  it,  therefore,\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to conscript our women? I am  not  a\r\n\r\nmale  chauvinist or under-estimating the capacity  of\r\n\r\nour  women and girls, but there is nearly a  thousand\r\n\r\nyears'   history  about  women's  role  in   military\r\n\r\nactivities. I am sure you have heard of Hua Mu Lan, a\r\n\r\ngirl in ancient China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir, it is not the policy of the Government during\r\n\r\nthis  financial year to recruit women into  the  NSF,\r\n\r\nnor  is there any money provided for such enlistment.\r\n\r\nUnder  these  circumstances, would the Member  be  in\r\n\r\norder to raise this matter which is not provided  for\r\n\r\nin the budget?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In that case, I\r\n\r\nwill  not  touch  on  it. I think  the  Minister  was\r\n\r\nperhaps not prepared as to how to answer my question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me raise the second question. It relates to\r\n\r\nconsideration for exemption from national service for\r\n\r\nthose whose families are in financial difficulty. For\r\n\r\ninstance, if the only son in the family is  the  sole\r\n\r\nbreadwinner,  or  in  the case  where  two  or  three\r\n\r\nbrothers  are being enlisted at the same time,  there\r\n\r\nshould be some arrangement where they can be enlisted\r\n\r\nfor  national service consecutively in order to  help\r\n\r\nthem in their financial difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my meet-the-people sessions in the past I have\r\n\r\nalso been asked to request the Ministry concerned  to\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  opt  for part-time  police  national\r\n\r\nservice, so that for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe period of their obligation these youngsters could\r\n\r\nhelp  their family by earning some money.  Some  such\r\n\r\napplications  have been rejected which act,  I  feel.\r\n\r\nwas  too  stringent or not quite humane. So  I  would\r\n\r\nlike   to  ask  the  Minister  to  ask  the  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  to exercise more sympathetic consideration\r\n\r\nfor  such petitions. Although the Committee comprises\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the various  quarters  of  our\r\n\r\nsociety,  including  the  industry, public  service,\r\n\r\nhigher  institutions  of learning,  and  professional\r\n\r\ncircles,  I  think  it  would be  better  to  include\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from the Social Welfare Department as\r\n\r\nthey  understand better the plight of a  poor  family\r\n\r\nand  so can provide the Committee with better grounds\r\n\r\nfor a more sympathetic and proper consideration. What\r\n\r\ndoes the Minister think about this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question I would like to raise is about\r\n\r\ndrug-taking incidents in the camps. This  is  a  very\r\n\r\nserious matter. I would like to ask how many cases of\r\n\r\ndrug-taking  have been discovered  in  the  past  few\r\n\r\nyears and what measures or action have been taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  military  or  camp authority to eliminate  this\r\n\r\nabuse?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, national service was introduced\r\n\r\nsometime  in  1967. During the initial period  a  few\r\n\r\nbatches  of  recruits were sent to the  1st  SIR  for\r\n\r\nthree  months  training and were  absorbed  into  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Defence Force. Subsequently, after a  couple\r\n\r\nof years when they were performing part-time service,\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  recruits  were  transferred  to  the\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary. There is a standing instruction\r\n\r\nsaying  that those affected by national service  must\r\n\r\ncompulsorily perform part-time national  service  for\r\n\r\n12  years  or  until  they reach  40  years  of  age,\r\n\r\nwhichever  is the later after having completed  full-time  national  service. I have  received  complaints\r\n\r\nfrom  many national service reservists, who had  been\r\n\r\ntransferred  to the Special Constabulary,  that  they\r\n\r\nwere  told  that  the period reckoned  for  part-time\r\n\r\nnational  service would commence from the  time  they\r\n\r\nwere transferred to the Special Constabulary. Can the\r\n\r\nMinister enlighten the House on this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that there are rumours that the\r\n\r\npart-time performance of reservists who have  reached\r\n\r\nthe age of 40 years has been abolished. Is this true?\r\n\r\nCould the Minister clarify this point?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether exemption from part-time\r\n\r\nnational service would be considered for a person who\r\n\r\nhas  passed  the  call-up age but who  is  called  up\r\n\r\nbecause of his employment in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of a person who wrote to the\r\n\r\nCentral  Manpower  Base that he  had  served  in  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary for a period of six years  from\r\n\r\n1962  to 1968 and that he had undergone all the basic\r\n\r\npolice training at the Police Academy and that he was\r\n\r\nin   active  service  during  the  riots,  the  civil\r\n\r\ndisturbances and other emergencies during that  time.\r\n\r\nHowever, due to pressure of shift duties and  private\r\n\r\nstudies,  he was unable to continue service with  the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Constabulary and he ultimately  resigned  in\r\n\r\n1968.  Currently, he is working in a statutory  board\r\n\r\nwhere his presence is required in times of emergency.\r\n\r\nBesides  having to work on shift duties, he  is  also\r\n\r\npursuing  private studies for a promotion. Therefore,\r\n\r\nhe  would like to know whether consideration would be\r\n\r\ngiven  for his past performance. I wonder whether  an\r\n\r\nexception could be made for such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case of a breadwinner of a family\r\n\r\nwho  passed away recently. The widow, a housewife now\r\n\r\nhas  to look after five children. The eldest-son  has\r\n\r\nbeen  serving full-time national service for the last\r\n\r\none  year. Can consideration be given for the boy  to\r\n\r\nbe discharged from national service, so that he could\r\n\r\nseek  employment to help the family financially?  Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister reply to this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, parents have now more or less accepted the\r\n\r\nconcept of national service. But then I have received\r\n\r\nnumerous complaints from parents that their boys have\r\n\r\nbeen   spoilt  after  being  enlisted  for   national\r\n\r\nservice.  Many of them indulge in undesirable  habits\r\n\r\nlike drinking and smoking which they never\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknew  before  they were called up. The  Minister  may\r\n\r\nblame the parents for their sons' behaviour. But then\r\n\r\nwe cannot expect the parents to know what is actually\r\n\r\nhappening in the camps. I understand that drinks  and\r\n\r\ncigarettes  are  sold cheaply in the camps  and  this\r\n\r\ncould be the reason why the boys indulge in these bad\r\n\r\nhabits.  When I say \"bad habits\". I do not mean  that\r\n\r\nan  individual should not drink or smoke.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat acquiring these habits at a very young age,  and\r\n\r\nespecially in the army, could be considered as  anti-social.  Basically,  even  the  Government  does  not\r\n\r\nencourage these habits and here in the army  we  find\r\n\r\nour  youths merrily drinking and smoking. I  have  to\r\n\r\nsay  this because in later years if the boys  indulge\r\n\r\nin  excessive  drinking  and  smoking  and  become  a\r\n\r\nnuisance  to  society, the parents  would  definitely\r\n\r\nblame  the army. When they drink and smoke, the  army\r\n\r\nwould not be run properly also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, touching on the make-up pay for national\r\n\r\nservice reservists who have been posted to the  Army,\r\n\r\nSpecial Constabulary and Vigilante Corps, there seems\r\n\r\nto  be some confusion in financial matters. Some  get\r\n\r\nallowances  and others get a remuneration,  depending\r\n\r\non whether he is in the Army, Special Constabulary or\r\n\r\nthe  Vigilante  Corps. For instance, it  is  gathered\r\n\r\nthat   a   national   serviceman   in   the   Special\r\n\r\nConstabulary  who  has to be on duty  outside  normal\r\n\r\noffice  hours will receive an allowance. He  will  be\r\n\r\npermitted  to  retain  this  allowance  without   any\r\n\r\ndeduction from the salary for the period of his  Army\r\n\r\nduty.  When he is called up for in-camp training,  he\r\n\r\nwill receive a remuneration and not an allowance. And\r\n\r\nhis   normal  salary  will  be  deducted   from   the\r\n\r\nremuneration  and paid the difference,  whichever  is\r\n\r\nthe greater. But those in the Vigilante Corps get  an\r\n\r\nallowance  for  in-camp training, and their  salaries\r\n\r\nare  not  affected at all. Why is there  no  standard\r\n\r\nrule  for  the  various services?  Can  the  Minister\r\n\r\nexplain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when the Ministry issues instructions relating\r\n\r\nto  national service, it does not specify  the  shift\r\n\r\nhours;  instead  it  uses a vague term  like  \"normal\r\n\r\noffice   hours\"  which  causes  confusion  to   those\r\n\r\ndepartments\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich have shift workers. This results in unnecessary\r\n\r\ncommunication  with  the Central  Manpower  Base  for\r\n\r\nfurther  information  and  clarification,  especially\r\n\r\nwhen money is involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that in future, any instruction issued by\r\n\r\nthe  CMPB should be very clear and specific  and  not\r\n\r\nvague  which  may  result  in  unnecessary  time  and\r\n\r\nstationery  being wasted on communication.  Sometimes\r\n\r\nbecause  of  this, the original standing  instruction\r\n\r\nmay be distorted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\npermit   me   to  refer  to  the  Addendum   to   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Address  at the opening  of  the  First\r\n\r\nSession of the Fourth Parliament on Tuesday, the  8th\r\n\r\nof  last month. I am referring, in particular, to the\r\n\r\nsubmission of the Ministry of Defence standing in the\r\n\r\nname  of  the Minister of Defence. Without  a  doubt.\r\n\r\nSir,   the  citizens  of  Singapore  accept  national\r\n\r\nservice  as a necessary duty of the young,  and  they\r\n\r\nproved  this  by  returning the PAP to  power  by  an\r\n\r\noverwhelming  majority at the  general  elections  of\r\n\r\nDecember 1976. The Addendum on Defence stressed  this\r\n\r\npoint, and I quote [Hansard, Vol. 36, Col. 21]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'However, since our defence forces have to import\r\n\r\nnearly  all  their weapons and equipment, the  rising\r\n\r\nprices  of  these products impose a severe  financial\r\n\r\nburden.  It  is therefore necessary to  exercise  the\r\n\r\nutmost economy in defence expenditure..'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A   committee  of  Finance  and  Defence  Ministries'\r\n\r\nofficials  was  appointed in November  1976  to  keep\r\n\r\nwatch  over  expenditure and prune it.  The  Addendum\r\n\r\ncarries on, and I again quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It will certainly be necessary to trim down manpower\r\n\r\nestablishments  and reduce or even abolish  vocations\r\n\r\nwhich do not contribute much to the combat efficiency\r\n\r\nof army units.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is,  therefore, surprising, Sir, to  notice  that\r\n\r\nthis  pruning  down  of  expenditure  results  in  an\r\n\r\nincrease  over FY 76 by 6.7% on Manpower  Expenditure\r\n\r\nand  by  22.9%  on Other Operating Expenditure.  This\r\n\r\namounts  to a total increase of 22.5% in FV  77  when\r\n\r\ncompared to FY 76. In addition, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment Estimates show an increase of 16.4%  over\r\n\r\nFY  76. If I may refresh the memory of this House, an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  only 25.4% over FV 75  was  tabled  for\r\n\r\napproval  about this time last year. I  am  wondering\r\n\r\nwhether  or not this is contradictory to the Addendum\r\n\r\nto   the  Presidential  Address,  or  is  there  some\r\n\r\nrational  explanation  as to  the  state  of  affairs\r\n\r\nindicated  in the Main and Development Estimates  for\r\n\r\nthe financial year 1st April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978, under Head K, Ministry of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to raise a matter which I hope the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nof  Defence  will  consider. This  is  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nstarting some form of compulsory saving scheme or CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  for  national servicemen.  Sir,  I  am\r\n\r\naware  that  a good number of our national servicemen\r\n\r\nare  paid  reasonably well for their term in national\r\n\r\nservice, particularly   those   with   `A'    level\r\n\r\ncertificates.  I  think it is far in  excess  of  the\r\n\r\nmarket  value  that holders of `A' level certificates\r\n\r\nwill command outside, either in the public or private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, we know that Officer Cadets receive a\r\n\r\nsum  of $420 per month; a Second Lieutenant $580  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  and  a full Lieutenant about $700 per  month.\r\n\r\nThis  is a huge sum of money for a young person. What\r\n\r\nhappens is that many of them may not be careful  with\r\n\r\nthe  way they spend and, therefore, they tend to  get\r\n\r\nused  to  a lot of money at a rather young age.  Once\r\n\r\nthey  leave  national service, they are  imbued  with\r\n\r\nhigh  expectations. I am told this  has  resulted  in\r\n\r\ncertain  problems  for some young  people  once  they\r\n\r\nleave   national  service  because  when  they  leave\r\n\r\nnational  service  and  enter  society  they   expect\r\n\r\nsimilarly  high  salaries and, where  possible, soft\r\n\r\njobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that the Ministry of Defence\r\n\r\nconsider  some  form  of compulsory  saving  for  our\r\n\r\nnational   servicemen,   maybe   in   the   form   of\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the Central  Provident  Fund  like\r\n\r\nother working men. Secondly, for those who intend  to\r\n\r\npursue  a higher education, this saving scheme  could\r\n\r\nhelp them out during the forthcoming lean years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> With your permission. Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  perhaps I had best reply to the matters  raised\r\n\r\nunder  this particular subhead now. First, the Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang regarding appeals. He is not satisfied,\r\n\r\nor rather his constituents are not satisfied with the\r\n\r\ndecisions  of  the  Appeals Board.  But  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that   fairness   has   been   done.   My\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary is personally responsible for\r\n\r\nseeing  that the Appeals Board's decisions are  fair,\r\n\r\nand  he  has  power to overrule the  Appeals  Board's\r\n\r\ndecision if he thinks it has been harsh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised a number of points.\r\n\r\nsome  of  them  under the wrong subhead, particularly\r\n\r\nmatters relating to the Special Constabulary and  the\r\n\r\nVigilante  Corps. These two subjects are administered\r\n\r\nby  the Minister for Home Affairs and he should  seek\r\n\r\nclarification from my colleague.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member says that some of his friends have\r\n\r\ncomplained that soldiers take to bad habits, such  as\r\n\r\nsmoking  and drinking. He even thought that  we  give\r\n\r\nduty free cigarettes and duty free drinks. We do  not\r\n\r\ngive  duty  free cigarettes. We give duty free  beer.\r\n\r\nBut  this  is the strange thing. The ration for  duty\r\n\r\nfree  beer  is  9 litres per soldier per  month.  The\r\n\r\nUnits can draw the rations and sell it either in  the\r\n\r\ncanteen  or  in the SAF messes at duty  free  prices.\r\n\r\nAlthough the entitlement is 9 litres per soldier  per\r\n\r\nmonth,  the  Units  take  less  than  10%  of   their\r\n\r\nentitlement. It averages up to about half a litre per\r\n\r\nsoldier per month. So ours is not a boozing army as I\r\n\r\nhave  mentioned to Members before. For  other  drinks\r\n\r\nlike hard liquor, they have to pay the full price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has raised the question of\r\n\r\ndrugs.  He wants to know what is the drug problem  in\r\n\r\nthe  SAF.  The drug problem in the SAF is just  about\r\n\r\nthe  same  as the drug problem outside the  SAF.  The\r\n\r\nCentral  Narcotics Bureau once made an estimate  that\r\n\r\nabout  1%  of  the adult population of  Singapore  is\r\n\r\nhooked  on  drugs, and it is getting most serious  in\r\n\r\nrecent  years  because they move on from  soft  drugs\r\n\r\nlike  marijuana to heroin. Something like 1%  of  the\r\n\r\nadult population is hooked on heroin. It is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  more than 1 1/2% for males and rather less  than 1/2% for females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drug position in the SAF is like this. Soldiers\r\n\r\nconvicted of drug offences - these are mostly  heroin\r\n\r\ncases  - and serving detention sentences number  196.\r\n\r\n475  soldiers have confessed to being on  drugs.  109\r\n\r\nsoldiers  are  under close arrest and awaiting  court\r\n\r\nmartial  if  the  urine tests turn up positive.  That\r\n\r\ngives a total of 780 soldiers on the record, which is\r\n\r\njust over 1% of the SAF population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What measures are we taking? We are taking very\r\n\r\nenergetic  measures. Towards the middle of last  year\r\n\r\nit  became  apparent  that this is  becoming  a  very\r\n\r\ndangerous problem among soldiers. First of all,  very\r\n\r\nstern  punishment  is necessary. Any  soldier  caught\r\n\r\nwith  a positive urine test gets 18 months' detention\r\n\r\nfor  the  first offence. Then we recruited a team  of\r\n\r\nfull-time   counsellors,  34  actually,   under   the\r\n\r\ndirection  of  a  medical  doctor  and  three  social\r\n\r\nscience  graduates.  They  are  trying  to  work   on\r\n\r\nsoldiers under detention in getting them out of  this\r\n\r\nhabit.  In addition, it has been proved necessary  to\r\n\r\nestablish our own drug analytical laboratory, because\r\n\r\nurine  samples  sent to the Department of  Scientific\r\n\r\nServices  take too long to process. We have  got  one\r\n\r\ndrug  laboratory established on the 1st of  February.\r\n\r\nAt   present  we  can  handle  70  samples  per  day.\r\n\r\nEventually,  when  new  equipment  arrives,  we  will\r\n\r\nhandle 200 samples a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my intention that every soldier in the SAF\r\n\r\nwill  be  periodically examined for  drug  addiction.\r\n\r\nDrug  suspects will be tested every week, so that  if\r\n\r\nthey  revert and get caught again then they  will  be\r\n\r\nsentenced  to  a much longer term of imprisonment.  I\r\n\r\nwill  give a full report to Parliament in due  course\r\n\r\non  how  successful  or otherwise  we  have  been  in\r\n\r\nhandling this very vexatious problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Kim Seng. Actually what he has\r\n\r\nproposed is being implemented. A Defence Committee of\r\n\r\nCabinet  has  agreed that national service  officers,\r\n\r\nwho  just leave school and want a big pay as  he  has\r\n\r\nstated,  will  have a good portion of their  salaries\r\n\r\ndocked into the CPF for the very reasons he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  mentioned, i.e, with too much pay they  tend  to\r\n\r\nwaste their money and have exaggerated ideas of their\r\n\r\nmarket value when they leave the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir raised the point about\r\n\r\nthe  Defence  budget and quoted my  Addendum  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address, that in spite of the  need  for\r\n\r\neconomy  there has been a big increase in the Defence\r\n\r\nbudget for this year. Well, this is for the reasons I\r\n\r\nhave mentioned in the Addendum, that hardware is very\r\n\r\nexpensive and we have to pay an awful lot for it.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  the reason for this need to economise  derives\r\n\r\nfrom our purchase of two pieces of equipment for  the\r\n\r\nAir Force, the F-5 supersonic fighter we are buying a\r\n\r\nsquadron and we have to pay $283 million for it.  And\r\n\r\nnot only that, we have to pay in advance. 70% of this\r\n\r\nmoney  will have to be paid before the first aircraft\r\n\r\narrives  because, for some unfathomable  reason,  the\r\n\r\nPentagon  believes that we are very  rich.  There  is\r\n\r\nalso  another  $50  million for  the  purchase  of  a\r\n\r\nsquadron of helicopters, and again we have got to pay\r\n\r\nmost of it in advance. So that makes $333 million,  a\r\n\r\nhefty whack, and as a result of that we have to carry\r\n\r\nout a very stringent economy drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member may be interested in some proposals which\r\n\r\nwill  be implemented from next month. All battalions.\r\n\r\ntraining schools and other units will be placed under\r\n\r\nrationing  for water and electricity.  They  will  be\r\n\r\nplaced under water rationing if we can get the PUB to\r\n\r\ninstal  water meters in these places. If their  quota\r\n\r\nfor water is up, well that is that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object is not so much to save money. I do not\r\n\r\nthink  we can save an awful lot of money by rationing\r\n\r\npetrol,  water or electricity, but to drive  home  to\r\n\r\nevery soldier that they have to save money so that if\r\n\r\nthis economy habit spreads into other spheres, then I\r\n\r\nthink the real savings will come from that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think these are the only main points raised\r\n\r\nby Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

For\r\n\r\ninstance,  between  January 1969  and  December  last\r\n\r\nyear,  4,642  persons went through the Outward  Bound\r\n\r\nSchool    courses.   2,500   were   from   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  and  only  32 were  from  the  community\r\n\r\ncentres.

I\r\n\r\nam  wondering why this is so. Is it because of a lack\r\n\r\nof  support for the Junior Flying Club, or has  there\r\n\r\nbeen  some form of cost reduction? I would also  like\r\n\r\nto  know  what  results have the Junior  Flying  Club\r\n\r\nobtained  in respect of their members graduating  and\r\n\r\nbecoming pilots in our Singapore Air Force?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about our Air Force, national servicemen and\r\n\r\nofficers  who  have completed their national  service\r\n\r\nhave  joined our universities.

It  is\r\n\r\nextremely popular among school boys and indeed  among\r\n\r\nschool  girls as well. The membership now  stands  at\r\n\r\n1,571,  of  which  337 have the  basic  academic  and\r\n\r\nphysical  requirements for flying in the  Air  Force,\r\n\r\nThe  others can take part in aeromodelling  and  also\r\n\r\nenjoy  facilities  of the Club, such  as  joy  rides,\r\n\r\npicnics and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards university undergraduates, there was a\r\n\r\nUniversity Air Squadron in existence years ago but it\r\n\r\nwas  abolished in 1975 when the squadron  was  merged\r\n\r\ninto the Junior Flying Club. Since then, no less than\r\n\r\n39  undergraduates have been enjoying the  facilities\r\n\r\nof the Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real purpose of the Club is not only to increase\r\n\r\nand spread enthusiasm for flying among young boys and\r\n\r\ngirls  and  undergraduate students but also  to  give\r\n\r\npractical training to young people who want  to  test\r\n\r\ntheir ability and aptitude for training as Combat air\r\n\r\nforce  pilots. Since 1971, 276 school boys and  girls\r\n\r\nhave  been given flying training lessons and  a  good\r\n\r\nnumber  of  them  have obtained their  private  pilot\r\n\r\nlicences  (PPL). Of the boys, 83% of those  who  have\r\n\r\nobtained  the PPL have applied to join the Air  Force\r\n\r\nand  a  good number of them have succeeded  in  their\r\n\r\napplications and have done exceedingly  well  at  the\r\n\r\nAir  Force  training  school. In fact,  the  wash-out\r\n\r\nrate,  as  it is known in the Air Force, is extremely\r\n\r\nlow  among ex-members of the Junior Flying  Club.

This point has\r\n\r\nalready  been repeated in this House on another  sub-head. Young people as well as their parents have come\r\n\r\nto regard national service as an essential measure of\r\n\r\ngovernment  and  a familiar feature of  life.  In  my\r\n\r\nconstituency and in other places when I enquire about\r\n\r\nexperience  of national service. I find young  people\r\n\r\nsaying how they have found it exciting or uneventful,\r\n\r\nhow  they have taken it in their stride, and  I  come\r\n\r\nacross parents who comment on how well their children\r\n\r\nhave  appeared physically after training and how much\r\n\r\nbetter  disciplined  they are, and  so  on,  in  such\r\n\r\nneutral  or favourable terms, contrary to some  other\r\n\r\nindications we have had in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I have been occasionally vexed by\r\n\r\nreports  indicating  that  the  relationship  between\r\n\r\nservicemen may well too often be characterised  by  a\r\n\r\nsort of careless nonchalance, indifference and, worse\r\n\r\nstill   (even   if  in  cases  that  do   not   occur\r\n\r\nfrequently), extreme antagonism. At the  very  least.\r\n\r\nwe  have  a  frank  indication from the  Minister  of\r\n\r\nDefence  himself in the remark he made recently  that\r\n\r\nthere seemed to be a camaraderie among members of the\r\n\r\nPDF battalion which was not often found in other army\r\n\r\nunits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SAF receives into National Service,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who have had their minds and  attitudes\r\n\r\nand  ways  of  behaviour set in the circumstances  of\r\n\r\ntheir   upbringing.  The  Singaporean  is  a   rugged\r\n\r\nindividualist,  prone more than  less  frequently  to\r\n\r\nplace  his own concerns, convenience even comfort  at\r\n\r\nquite  a  premium, He chafes under discipline.  Young\r\n\r\nofficers, given rank, may all too easily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nallow this to get to their head. Yet for the sake  of\r\n\r\nmorale,  the  SAF  has  to concern  itself  with  the\r\n\r\nproblem   of   improving  the  sense  of  camaraderie\r\n\r\nprevailing in all units.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems of indifference we can see in other armies.\r\n\r\nYou  will  frequently find jokes about this  sort  of\r\n\r\nrelationship. If I might be allowed to  recount  one.\r\n\r\nIt  appears  that  an  army doctor  was  examining  a\r\n\r\nprospective  serviceman, \"Sit down  in  that  chair\",\r\n\r\nordered   the   doctor   sternly.   The   prospective\r\n\r\nserviceman  obeyed. \"A 1\", cried the doctor.  \"Next\".\r\n\r\n\"What?\",  exclaimed the recruit, \"why, you  have  not\r\n\r\neven  looked  at me.\" \"Well\", said the  doctor,  \"you\r\n\r\nheard me tell you to sit down, you saw the chair  and\r\n\r\nyou  had enough intelligence to carry out the  order.\r\n\r\nMove on, soldier!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has given indication that our\r\n\r\nmedical examination is a serious matter, for  he  has\r\n\r\nsaid  that exemptions on medical grounds are  granted\r\n\r\nonly  if the person is certified by a medical  board,\r\n\r\nconsisting of, I think, three doctors. Yet there have\r\n\r\nbeen cases of persons entering national service,  who\r\n\r\nhave  physically and emotionally in a  few  instances\r\n\r\nnot  been able to bear up in the stresses and strains\r\n\r\nof soldiering. In isolated instances the results have\r\n\r\nbeen  grave, and in other instances could  have  been\r\n\r\ngraver, as reports and descriptions in the newspapers\r\n\r\nhave indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that there are cases where\r\n\r\nparents  correctly feel they have  good  reasons  for\r\n\r\nentertaining some apprehension about a condition that\r\n\r\nmay have arisen regarding the health or well-being of\r\n\r\ntheir son in national service. In such instances such\r\n\r\nparents  would feel immensely relieved  if  they  had\r\n\r\naccess  to  a  person or committee with authority  to\r\n\r\nconsider  facts  placed  before  them  and  to  order\r\n\r\nimmediate  action. Such early action may  well  avert\r\n\r\nunpleasant  consequences  resulting  from   lack   of\r\n\r\nsufficient attention being given to the special needs\r\n\r\nof some servicemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to train fighters, and the army is a big\r\n\r\nplace;  but wherever we can introduce a more personal\r\n\r\ntouch,  we should try to do so.

The  Griffith\r\n\r\ntranslation says \"Command them (troops) with civility\r\n\r\nand  imbue them uniformly with martial ardour and  it\r\n\r\nmay  be said that victory is certain\". The Minister's\r\n\r\ncopy  has  this  translation.  \"When  an  army  prove\r\n\r\namenable  to  civil treatment as well as to  military\r\n\r\ndiscipline, they will surely become invincible\".

Incidentally, Sir, I know that the\r\n\r\nlines  that  follow the quotation I  have  given  may\r\n\r\ncontradict what I have said, but that is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister to make the point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir, a small nation like\r\n\r\nSingapore has been able to build up a strong  defence\r\n\r\nforce so rapidly to replace the vacuum created by the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  of  the  British,  Australian,  and   New\r\n\r\nZealand Forces. The achievements and success are  due\r\n\r\nlargely to the able leadership and farsightedness  of\r\n\r\nthe Minister of Defence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, national service has become an aspect of our\r\n\r\nnational  life, which is here to stay.

It is  about  the  same\r\n\r\nlevel  as  the  Member for Anson who  said  that  his\r\n\r\nrelative's  children joined the  Army  to  smoke  and\r\n\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually a recruit goes through not just one but two\r\n\r\nmedical  examinations.  I have  been  advised  by  my\r\n\r\nManpower  Division  that  each  examination  lasts  a\r\n\r\nminimum  of 75 minutes for those who have no  defects\r\n\r\neither  of eye, foot or whatever. For those who  have\r\n\r\nto  go  for  a  further  test, do  so  because  their\r\n\r\neyesight  is  not good, or something  is  wrong  with\r\n\r\ntheir  blood, leg or chest, and the examination lasts\r\n\r\n110  minutes. If the Member for Katong has any doubt,\r\n\r\nhe is free to go to the Manpower Division at any time\r\n\r\nto see how the medical examinations are carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has raised a serious point about soldiers who\r\n\r\nbreak  down  under  stress and commit  all  kinds  of\r\n\r\nunseemly conduct. In this\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmorning's Straits Times there is a picture of a half-naked  soldier on the sixth floor of a Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat  threatening  to  jump down.  This  is  quite  a\r\n\r\nfamiliar  experience in the SAF. We call them  \"para-suicides\"  - they  threaten  to  commit  suicide   but\r\n\r\nactually they never do. The favourite forms of  para-suicides  are consumption of insect repellents,  soap\r\n\r\nsolutions,  Brasso; sometimes even pins and  needles,\r\n\r\nbut  that is rather rare. When para-suicides  consume\r\n\r\nthese  things, they make sure that people are  around\r\n\r\nso that help is immediately forthcoming. At one time,\r\n\r\nand acting on the advice of psychologists, we thought\r\n\r\nwe  should  treat them rather gently;  for  instance,\r\n\r\ngiving them psychiatric treatment and changing  their\r\n\r\nvocation  from a hard one to a soft one.  The  result\r\n\r\nwas  that the para-suicide rate doubled. So now after\r\n\r\neach  act  of para-suicide, a board of officers  goes\r\n\r\ninto   the   details   to  see   whether   there   is\r\n\r\njustification  for  further  punishment,  and   there\r\n\r\nusually  is.  These people break down  under  stress.\r\n\r\nThey  cannot  cope with their work, and  they  commit\r\n\r\nthese acts partly as a means of protest and partly as\r\n\r\na  method  of drawing attention to what they consider\r\n\r\nas their \"distressful\" situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been following this over the years. This\r\n\r\nhappens not only in the SAF but also in other  armies\r\n\r\nof  the world, in fact, all armies of the world.  The\r\n\r\nrate of para-suicide among our national servicemen in\r\n\r\nthe  army  last year was 55, about one a  week.  This\r\n\r\nworks out to 128 per 100,000 of population. The  rate\r\n\r\nof  para-suicides for other armies,  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nKatong  might be interested to know; in the  American\r\n\r\nArmy for the year 1969/70, the para-suicide rate  was\r\n\r\n392;  in the Australian Army for the year 1971/72  it\r\n\r\nwas  225.  The  figures are not  strictly  comparable\r\n\r\nbecause  definitions are not precisely the same.  But\r\n\r\nit  does  show  that what happens in  our  army  does\r\n\r\nhappen  in  other  armies in more or  less  the  same\r\n\r\nproportions. In fact, the suicide rate in the SAF  is\r\n\r\nalways  the  same as that in the American  Army.  The\r\n\r\nsuicide  rate among soldiers last year was  15.3  per\r\n\r\n100,000  in  1976, In the American Army it  was  15.6\r\n\r\nbetween the years 1959 and 1964.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the solution? Perhaps if there is some way\r\n\r\nof testing young men to see whether or not they could\r\n\r\nstand up to the stresses of army training, this would\r\n\r\nbe the best way. But so far as I know, no country has\r\n\r\ndevised this kind of test. In any event, if we  apply\r\n\r\nthis  kind of test, there is no way of ensuring  that\r\n\r\nthose who go through it might not be malingering. The\r\n\r\nproblem  is  a  real  one  in  the  army  and  it  is\r\n\r\nunavoidable   when  you  handle  large   numbers   of\r\n\r\nsoldiers. I think I have dealt with the points raised\r\n\r\nby the Member for Katong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi objects to young men in\r\n\r\nuniform  making  catcalls at girls  or  whistling  at\r\n\r\nthem.  Not so many years ago he himself was  a  young\r\n\r\nman.  I do not know whether he did not engage in this\r\n\r\nkind  of  activity. I would hate to  think  that  our\r\n\r\nyouth  are  so  lacking in red blood corpuscles  that\r\n\r\nthey do not do these things. However, if it is really\r\n\r\nserious, the Member should get the details, time  and\r\n\r\nplace of occurrence, and there is a good chance  that\r\n\r\nwe  will catch the culprit; but it must really not be\r\n\r\nharmless  remarks made in good fun and  clean  spirit\r\n\r\nwhich  probably the girls themselves might not object\r\n\r\nto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, there is another point regarding\r\n\r\nthe  question I asked about the dissemination of  the\r\n\r\ncode of conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes. The Member is interested in\r\n\r\nthis  because he has played a prominent part  in  the\r\n\r\ndrafting of this code of conduct. It was through  him\r\n\r\nthat  I contacted a Jesuit priest who made the  first\r\n\r\ndraft.  I  am  afraid the teaching  of  the  code  of\r\n\r\nconduct in the SAF leaves much to be desired,  partly\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is taught by officers who go through  it\r\n\r\nyear  in  and  year  out and not  to  a  particularly\r\n\r\ninspiring class. In one case, we found that a soldier\r\n\r\nput a transistor radio under his cap during this code\r\n\r\nof  conduct  lesson. We are trying to  find  ways  of\r\n\r\nimproving it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the humane treatment of soldiers, I agree\r\n\r\ncompletely  with  what the Member  for  Katong  said,\r\n\r\nparticularly as he\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas able to back Sun Tzu for his views.

The point is that I\r\n\r\ndid relate that shaggy-dog story but that was not  in\r\n\r\nany  sense trying to make fun of the SAF. I  did  say\r\n\r\nthat  the medical examination was thoroughly  carried\r\n\r\nout. I would like to thank the Minister very much for\r\n\r\ncomparing me with the Member for Anson because I have\r\n\r\na  high  regard  and respect for him because  of  his\r\n\r\nperformance in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $799,334,410 for Head K ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $109,600,000 for Head K ordered to stand\r\n\r\npart of the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head L -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

May I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow what improvements are to be carried out in these\r\n\r\nhospitals, and how would these improvements  be  felt\r\n\r\nwhen  there is an acute shortage of medical personnel\r\n\r\nat the moment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometime ago, there was mention of a zoning system\r\n\r\nfor  the hospitals. I wonder how this is working out.\r\n\r\nI  gather  that the Singapore General Hospital  still\r\n\r\ntreats  a  lot  of cases from other  zones.  Is  this\r\n\r\nsystem really workable?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Health Ministry is aware of the plight of\r\n\r\nthose  who  are over 60 years old, as they  are  more\r\n\r\nvulnerable  to  illness because of  the  degeneration\r\n\r\nprocess.   Though  they  constitute   6.6%   of   the\r\n\r\npopulation,  they  comprise  15.5%  of  all  hospital\r\n\r\nadmissions  and 27.4% of long-staying  patients.  The\r\n\r\nMinistry  itself is aware that this group  of  people\r\n\r\nfall sick off and on and that hospital bills have  to\r\n\r\nbe paid whenever medical attention is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old people in most cases are not well-off like the\r\n\r\nothers.  The  marginal utility of money for  them  is\r\n\r\ngreat.  With the present high cost of living, medical\r\n\r\nbills are quite often a burden to them. It is a  fact\r\n\r\nthat a general reduction of hospital charges will not\r\n\r\nbe  possible.  But I wonder whether a concession  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged  would be considered. I know  of  many  old\r\n\r\npeople  who  do  not consult doctors because  of  the\r\n\r\nheavy  charges.  Will  the Minister  look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a shortage of male nurses or manpower\r\n\r\nin  certain  hospitals or clinics. Just to  quote  an\r\n\r\nincident.  An emergency call was put through  Control\r\n\r\nrequesting for an ambulance for an orthopaedic  case.\r\n\r\nThe  call was diverted to Siglap Orthopaedic Hospital\r\n\r\nsince  the accident occurred in that area. At present\r\n\r\nthe  ambulance at this centre is manned by a  driver,\r\n\r\nan  attendant and a nurse, who are on stand-by  duty.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  alarming  is how could these  three  people\r\n\r\nhandle a heavily-built person from a high rise flat?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in this home accident case, a heavily built\r\n\r\nman weighing 200 lbs, fractured\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  leg  and had to be carried down from the  fourth\r\n\r\nstorey. When the ambulance came, the driver stood  by\r\n\r\nthe  ambulance, the attendant carried  the  stretcher\r\n\r\nand  the nurse followed him up to the flat where  the\r\n\r\naccident occurred. They had a tough time carrying the\r\n\r\npatient  onto  the  stretcher.  Then  there  was  the\r\n\r\nproblem of how to carry this patient down the  flight\r\n\r\nof stairs. The nurse could not do much and had to ask\r\n\r\nfor help from the neighbours. But there was not a man\r\n\r\naround  to help, as all the men had gone to work.  So\r\n\r\nunfortunately  the  nurse and  an  old  lady  from  a\r\n\r\nneighbouring  flat had to carry this patient  to  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  ambulance. The question is: why is a trained\r\n\r\nmale nurse not provided in all ambulances?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again there are complaints of inadequate\r\n\r\ntransport   facilities  for  patients   referred   by\r\n\r\nspecialist clinics to the major hospitals. There have\r\n\r\nbeen  instances where patients who have been attended\r\n\r\nto  by  Government doctors in specialist clinics  are\r\n\r\nreferred for admission to a major hospital. A patient\r\n\r\narrives  at  the clinic at about 8.30 a.m. and  after\r\n\r\nconsulting  the  doctor  at  about  9.00  a.m. he  is\r\n\r\nreferred to a major hospital. The staff at the clinic\r\n\r\nthen summons for an ambulance, and this is where  the\r\n\r\nlong wait starts. The ambulance arrives sometimes  at\r\n\r\nabout  11.30  a.m. If the patient needs  an  ambulance\r\n\r\nbadly, other means of transport is provided, in which\r\n\r\ncase  he  has  got  to be uncomfortably  transported.\r\n\r\nHaving  arrived at the hospital and by  the  time  he\r\n\r\ngoes   through   the   administrative   process   for\r\n\r\nadmission, it would be about 1 p.m. Thus, he may have\r\n\r\nto  skip  his lunch. Some patients have to go without\r\n\r\nlunch  and  in  some cases, they would  have  already\r\n\r\nmissed  their breakfast, as they have to  be  at  the\r\n\r\nclinic  before  8.00 a.m. to beat the  rush.  In  most\r\n\r\ncases, investigations have revealed that there  is  a\r\n\r\nshortage   of  vehicles  to  immediately  cater   for\r\n\r\nadmitting  patients.  This  has  inconvenienced  many\r\n\r\npatients  due to the frustration caused by having  to\r\n\r\nwait for medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the Maternal and Child Health Clinic and also at other outpatient clinics,\r\n\r\nwhenever  a  resident doctor is  not  available,  the\r\n\r\ndoctor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  duty  is  normally summoned by the staff  of  the\r\n\r\nclinic  and he takes a long time to arrive.  This  is\r\n\r\nbecause of the shortage of doctors which seems to  be\r\n\r\na perpetual problem. Last year, 100 doctors resigned.\r\n\r\nWhat  is  the Minister going to do? He will  have  to\r\n\r\nemploy  more doctors. I admit it is difficult to  get\r\n\r\nthe doctors but we should stop them from migrating to\r\n\r\nother  countries,  Meanwhile, the  patients  normally\r\n\r\nsmall  children  and toddlers, start  to  cry  for  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  time at the clinic.  Can  something  be\r\n\r\ndone to summon a doctor early?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to mention is that\r\n\r\ngenerally  the  wards  and toilets  in  most  of  our\r\n\r\nhospitals  are filthy and at times vulgar scribblings\r\n\r\nare found. I wonder whether checks are carried out to\r\n\r\nsee  that  all  the wards and public toilets  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals are kept clean. Sir, most probably all  the\r\n\r\ntoilets  are  cleaned  by the  time  I  filed  in  my\r\n\r\namendment to speak on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard comments from nurses that while they\r\n\r\nare  expected  to present a neat and tidy  look,  the\r\n\r\nuniforms   supplied  to  them  are  generally   below\r\n\r\nstandard. This is probably due to the acceptance of a\r\n\r\ncheap  tender. Even the shoes are not up to standard.\r\n\r\nSome of the nurses, therefore, have to sew their  own\r\n\r\nuniforms.  Alternatively, why do we not provide  them\r\n\r\nwith  a uniform allowance instead of supplying  them?\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry could give them a uniform allowance of,\r\n\r\nsay,  $100.  It  is better that they make  their  own\r\n\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, tuberculosis is an\r\n\r\ninfectious disease common to man and certain animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1960 the PAP Government initiated the programme to\r\n\r\nensure  that the incidence level of this disease  was\r\n\r\nsuppressed. The Tuberculosis Control Unit was set  up\r\n\r\naiming  at, among other things, active  case-finding\r\n\r\nand  adequate treatment for all tuberculosis  victims\r\n\r\ndiscovered and immunisation of all children. The  BCG\r\n\r\nvaccination programme covers over 90% of all  infants\r\n\r\nin Singapore.

They have\r\n\r\nbeen hovering on the 3,000-plus mark, and one wonders\r\n\r\nwhy  such a situation exists when in addition to  the\r\n\r\nTuberculosis Control Unit we have SATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the role of SATA in relation to the\r\n\r\nTuberculosis Control Unit?

The figures speak for themselves, Sir, What  is\r\n\r\nmost  worrying, Sir, is the fact that most  employers\r\n\r\nutilise  SATA  to  check the pulmonary  condition  of\r\n\r\ntheir  workers and SATA. I believe, does not go  into\r\n\r\nthe  treatment  of tuberculosis. How  many  cases  of\r\n\r\nactive  pulmonary lesions have been referred by  SATA\r\n\r\nto  the Tuberculosis Control Unit for treatment? What\r\n\r\nis  SATA's grant from Government, and are we  getting\r\n\r\nthe  best  from SATA? These are bothersome  questions\r\n\r\nthat  must  be  answered.  I  hope  some  active  and\r\n\r\npositive steps will be taken to ensure a drastic drop\r\n\r\nin the Tuberculosis figures in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, sometime in October last year it\r\n\r\nwas  reported that more than 30 people  died  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of America of heart or lung  diseases\r\n\r\nafter  receiving  swine-flu  vaccination.

We see  that  this  year  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's estimated expenditure is somewhere in  the\r\n\r\nregion  of $187 million and development estimates  at\r\n\r\n$62  million. This, therefore, places the expenditure\r\n\r\nfor the Health Ministry fourth after Finance, Defence\r\n\r\nand  Education.  Coupled with this is the  increasing\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  our  people  for  better  and   more\r\n\r\nsophisticated  medical attention.  I  therefore  feel\r\n\r\nthat somehow things are not going to be that easy for\r\n\r\npeople  to  seek treatment in the future, considering\r\n\r\nthe  rather nominal charges that have been levied to-date. I would therefore request the Hon. Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  to  enlighten this House if his  Ministry  is\r\n\r\nconsidering any possible hike in medical fees in  the\r\n\r\nnear future and, if so, what form it will take.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point on which I wish to seek\r\n\r\nclarification is in regard to a newspaper report that\r\n\r\nthe  Health Ministry is considering classifying wards\r\n\r\ninto  five categories. At the present moment we  have\r\n\r\nthree,  and  I  cannot see any real reason  for  this\r\n\r\nfurther  classification which, I think, may just  add\r\n\r\non to the confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to raise is in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  the  construction of a  convalescent  or\r\n\r\nnursing  home  which will serve more  as  a  half-way\r\n\r\nhouse   for   total   patient  care.   As   correctly\r\n\r\nemphasised,  the present hospitals are to  cater  for\r\n\r\nacute medical attention and treatment. But even  with\r\n\r\nthe decentralisation of our hospitals, we still get a\r\n\r\ngood  number  of long-staying patients  who  clog  up\r\n\r\nacute  beds.  These cases are not fit  enough  to  be\r\n\r\ndischarged  from  hospital  because  they   are   not\r\n\r\nindependent enough to be at home. There are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmany  such  problem cases which we  see  in  hospital\r\n\r\nroutines everyday. I would therefore ask the Ministry\r\n\r\nto consider setting up these convalescent homes which\r\n\r\ncan  be  run rather cheaply, requiring little medical\r\n\r\nattention  but  more nursing care. I  appreciate  the\r\n\r\nfact  that  the  Home  Nursing  Foundation  has  been\r\n\r\nestablished.  But  I think that caters, only  for  a\r\n\r\nspecific  type of home nursing care. We are aware  of\r\n\r\nmany  medical  problems, for example,  patients  with\r\n\r\nstroke  who  tend to lie in hospital  for  weeks  and\r\n\r\nsometimes months; surgical problems of patients  with\r\n\r\ndiabetes and those who are amputees and are not  able\r\n\r\nto  go  home  early.  On top of  that,  we  have  the\r\n\r\nmultiple-injured patients who cannot possibly be sent\r\n\r\nhome  in  the 20th storey of a HDB flat. In  view  of\r\n\r\nthese  problems  I  sincerely  suggest  to  the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  that  some consideration be given  for  the\r\n\r\nsetting up of such a hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your\r\n\r\npermission  if  I may pick the point  raised  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  with regard to the  shortage  and\r\n\r\nrecruitment of doctors in the hospitals. I would just\r\n\r\nlike to make `the suggestion to the Hon. Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth  that  in  future medical students  graduating\r\n\r\nfrom  the  School of Medicine should compulsorily  be\r\n\r\nmade to serve in the hospitals, say, for a period  of\r\n\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I just take up the\r\n\r\nspecific points raised by Members of the House before\r\n\r\nI  enter into a general statement, particularly  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  staffing the hospitals with doctors.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson has stated that  we  are  spending\r\n\r\nmoney  to  improve  hospitals  and  he  has  enquired\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have  adequate  doctors  to  man   these\r\n\r\nhospitals.  I would like to explain that improvements\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are  going to make to the  hospitals  will\r\n\r\namount to only $9 million, and they are intended  for\r\n\r\nold  hospitals,  such as the Tan Tock Seng  Hospital,\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Hospital,  Kandang  Kerbau  Hospital   and\r\n\r\nWoodbridge  Hospital. All these hospitals were  built\r\n\r\nbefore the war. I have visited all the hospitals  but\r\n\r\nI must confess that I have not made an exploration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto  public toilets. If the Member for Anson reports\r\n\r\nthat  the toilets are in a disgraceful state, then  I\r\n\r\nmust  say that it might be a good idea if he  carries\r\n\r\nout  an  education campaign among the users of public\r\n\r\ntoilets so that they do the right thing in the  right\r\n\r\nplace.  However.  I shall bring this  matter  to  the\r\n\r\nattention  of  the  Medical Superintendents  and  the\r\n\r\nsecretaries  in the hospitals so that public  toilets\r\n\r\nwill be used for what they are intended to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also mentioned that the\r\n\r\nMaternal  and  Child Health clinics are understaffed.\r\n\r\nStrangely  enough.  I hear from the  Member  for  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  that his Maternal and Child Health  Clinic  is\r\n\r\nirrelevant  because, as a result of a very successful\r\n\r\nfamily  planning campaign, there are very few mothers\r\n\r\ntaking  their  children  to the  Maternal  and  Child\r\n\r\nHealth Clinic at Toa Payoh. And he is requesting that\r\n\r\nthis   clinic   be  converted  into   an   outpatient\r\n\r\ndepartment. It is true that in the past the  Maternal\r\n\r\nand Child Health Clinics were run separately from the\r\n\r\nOutpatient departments and from the school  services.\r\n\r\nBecause  of this set-up, the utilisation of  manpower\r\n\r\nwas  not  optimum, and last year we  integrated  the\r\n\r\nMaternal  and  Child Health Clinics  and  the  school\r\n\r\nservices together with the Outpatient departments  so\r\n\r\nthat  we can make full use of the staff. In this  way\r\n\r\nwe  hope to be able at least for the next three years\r\n\r\nto overcome the problem of shortage of doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ambulance services will be integrated by April\r\n\r\nor  May  of  this year after a discussion between  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  and  the  Ministry of  Social  Affairs.  In\r\n\r\nfuture the public need ring only one number and  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  able to get a public ambulance provided  by\r\n\r\nthe   Fire   Brigade.  There  will  be   a   distinct\r\n\r\nimprovement  in  the  ambulance  services,  Moreover.\r\n\r\nthese ambulances will be controlled by radio so  that\r\n\r\nthere will be constant contact between the ambulances\r\n\r\nand  the  Accident and Emergency Departments  in  the\r\n\r\nhospitals.   However,  with  regard   to   ambulances\r\n\r\ncarrying  patients  from  one  hospital  to   another\r\n\r\nhospital, I would say that after the integration  the\r\n\r\nload  on  hospital  ambulances  will  be  eased   and\r\n\r\ntherefore patients need not have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto wait that long if they have to be transported from\r\n\r\none hospital to another for specialist treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Potong Pasir has mentioned about the\r\n\r\nprevalence   of   tuberculosis   cases.    For    his\r\n\r\ninformation, there were 4,711 cases in 1965 and 2,815\r\n\r\ncases  in 1976. If we were to calculate the rate  per\r\n\r\nthousand population, they work out to 250 in 1965 and\r\n\r\n124  in 1976. This means that the rate has gone  down\r\n\r\nby  50.6%  in 12 years. So there has really  been  no\r\n\r\nincrease  in  the number of tuberculosis  cases.  The\r\n\r\nreason why we are still seeing a significantly  large\r\n\r\nnumber of tuberculosis cases is that tuberculosis  is\r\n\r\nprevalent  among  that  generation  which  has  never\r\n\r\nreceived   BCG   vaccination.  BCG  vaccination   was\r\n\r\nintroduced in Singapore only in the late 195Os and it\r\n\r\nis  to be expected that the older generation will  be\r\n\r\ncarrying  tuberculosis and spreading it to those  who\r\n\r\nare  at  risk.  So it will be many more years  before\r\n\r\ntuberculosis disappears entirely from Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SATA is a separate organisation. It has no\r\n\r\nconnections with the Ministry of Health. It  receives\r\n\r\na  subsidy  of  $35,000 from the Ministry  of  Social\r\n\r\nAffairs.  I am told that operations of SATA have  now\r\n\r\nexpanded  to cover heart and chest diseases. However,\r\n\r\nSATA  is  bound to notify the Ministry of  Health  of\r\n\r\ntuberculosis cases that it comes across,  SATA,  like\r\n\r\nany  other private practitioner, is entitled to treat\r\n\r\ntuberculosis cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his question on swine-flu vaccine,\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry has ordered several thousand  doses  of\r\n\r\nvaccines,  but  they have not yet  arrived.  Off  the\r\n\r\ncuff, I think that the total cost would come to about\r\n\r\n$600,000.\r\n\r\nThe  number  of doses ordered has been calculated  to\r\n\r\nprovide,   first,  for  those  who  are  working   in\r\n\r\nessential  services. If there is a demand by  members\r\n\r\nof  the  public, then more doses will be ordered  but\r\n\r\nthey  will  have  to pay at about $5  per  dose.  The\r\n\r\nvaccine  that  we have ordered will offer  protection\r\n\r\nagainst swine-flu, Hongkong flu and Victoria `A' flu.\r\n\r\nIt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis a tri-valent vaccine. When the vaccine arrives, we\r\n\r\nwill first vaccinate national servicemen because they\r\n\r\nlive  together in camps and are very likely to spread\r\n\r\ninfluenza among themselves and to their families when\r\n\r\nthey return home from camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Member for Kim Seng as to whether\r\n\r\nthere will be any increase in medical charges. I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  this is being looked into.  In  the  first\r\n\r\ninstance,  we  are  studying  the  rationale  for  an\r\n\r\nincrease  in  dental  charges.  As  of  this  moment,\r\n\r\nMembers are aware that the Ministry is charging  only\r\n\r\n$4  per patient per treatment. This, of course, leads\r\n\r\nto  pressure  in  the  demand for  treatment  in  the\r\n\r\nMinistry's Dental Department. For a charge of $4, the\r\n\r\ndental surgeon has to spend probably half an hour  on\r\n\r\na patient. This is patently absurd. So we are looking\r\n\r\ninto the matter to vary the charges, according to the\r\n\r\ntype  of treatment that is to be provided as well  as\r\n\r\naccording  to  the time that has to  be  spent  on  a\r\n\r\nparticular  patient. When there is  any  increase  in\r\n\r\ndental  or medical charges, we will announce them  in\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newspapers have got hold of a story that we are\r\n\r\ncontemplating on introducing five classes  of  wards.\r\n\r\nIt is a true story. As of this moment, there are only\r\n\r\nthree  classes - A class for which we charge $60  per\r\n\r\nday. B class $30 per day and C class $4. There is  an\r\n\r\nenormous gap between $4 and $30 and $30 and $60. With\r\n\r\nsuccessful  family  planning and  greater  acceptance\r\n\r\nthat  two  children  are  enough,  more  parents  are\r\n\r\nanxious that they and their children receive the best\r\n\r\nmedical  care. Doctors and the nurses at the  Kandang\r\n\r\nKerbau Hospital have been plagued with requests  from\r\n\r\nC class patients, even B class patients, to be lodged\r\n\r\nin  A class wards. The number of requests amounts  to\r\n\r\nabout  eight to 1 2 per day. I believe that  $60  per\r\n\r\nday  may  be too high for some middle income  groups,\r\n\r\nand  likewise  $30 may be too high for  some  working\r\n\r\nclass  people.  But  bearing in mind  that  there  is\r\n\r\nincreasing affluence, and there has been  a  rise  in\r\n\r\nwages or income among the population, we have decided\r\n\r\nto introduce\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  second A class ward and a second B class  ward  so\r\n\r\nthat  a  patient can pay according to  a  progressive\r\n\r\nscale  of charges. This. I think, is fairer than  the\r\n\r\npresent  system  where there is an  enormous  quantum\r\n\r\njump  from $30 B class to $60 A class and from  $4  C\r\n\r\nclass to $30 B class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The C class ward will be intended primarily for\r\n\r\nthose who really cannot afford to pay, and I think it\r\n\r\nis  fair  that  the  people of  Singapore  should  be\r\n\r\nconscious that medical costs have gone up by 300%  in\r\n\r\nthe  last  five years, or about 1.15% of the  GNP  in\r\n\r\n1975, and therefore part of the cost will have to  be\r\n\r\npaid for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's suggestion that we should open a\r\n\r\nnursing  or  convalescent home for stroke  and  other\r\n\r\nchronic  patients. I regret that our studies indicate\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  going  to be very difficult  to  do  so\r\n\r\nbecause we have discovered from the experience of the\r\n\r\nUnited  Kingdom that nursing homes or even homes  for\r\n\r\nthe  aged  are very expensive to run as  compared  to\r\n\r\ntreating   them   as  outpatients.   In   1970,   the\r\n\r\nexpenditure  spent by the British Government  on  in-patients   was  \ufffd293  million.  On  outpatients   \ufffd24\r\n\r\nmillion.  On home nursing only \ufffd12 million.  But  the\r\n\r\ncost  of  running homes for the aged shot up  to  \ufffd53\r\n\r\nmillion. And presumably the same economic rules  will\r\n\r\napply  to  us if we try to run homes for the  chronic\r\n\r\nsick.  Worse  than that, I am afraid that  in  future\r\n\r\nyears  we are going to face a labour shortage. Mindef\r\n\r\nis  already facing that problem. It has announced the\r\n\r\nneed  to  recruit  women into non-combatant  national\r\n\r\nservice and maybe in 10 or 15 years' time we may  not\r\n\r\neven find the people who want to work in convalescent\r\n\r\nhomes or in nursing homes for the chronic sick.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  nagging  problem.  I  am  already  finding  it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to recruit people who will want  to  work,\r\n\r\nlet   us  say, in  Woodbridge  Hospital.  Woodbridge\r\n\r\nHospital  is intended to house those who are mentally\r\n\r\nill.  But  those  who are mentally  ill  have  become\r\n\r\ngeriatric cases. From a state of mental illness  they\r\n\r\nhave  advanced  to  a  state of mental  senility.  So\r\n\r\nWoodbridge Hospital is really a combination of a home\r\n\r\nfor  the aged as well as a home for the mentally ill.\r\n\r\nDoctors in particular are very reluctant to work in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWoodbridge  Hospital, and that is why  my  sympathies\r\n\r\nand my encouragement go to those who are prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake  on a job which is unpopular and not at all very\r\n\r\nattractive, because working in a home like that  does\r\n\r\nnot provide an outlet and encourage a doctor to leave\r\n\r\nthe Ministry to enter into private practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided to concentrate on home\r\n\r\nnursing   as  explained  in  the  Addendum   to   the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address. The Home Nursing Foundation will\r\n\r\ndeal with patients referred to by hospital doctors in\r\n\r\nthe  first  instance, and it is part of primary  care\r\n\r\nservice.  This is one sector which we hope to  expand\r\n\r\nand on which money will be spent. More nurses will be\r\n\r\nrecruited for this particular aspect of home  nursing\r\n\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, let me come to the vexing problem raised by\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Anson and the Member for Punggol  on\r\n\r\nthe  shortage of doctors. I am afraid that there  are\r\n\r\nmany  factors relating to the exodus of doctors  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Health, and it is a  problem  which\r\n\r\nrequires  some  degree of analysis. I would  like  to\r\n\r\nmake it quite clear that we should make a distinction\r\n\r\nbetween  doctors who migrate and leave Singapore  and\r\n\r\ndoctors  who  leave the Ministry of Health  to  enter\r\n\r\nprivate  practice. Members may be aware or  recollect\r\n\r\nthat  the  Ministry of Defence last month  advertised\r\n\r\nthat two of their doctors holding the rank of Captain\r\n\r\ndeserted  national  service by  absconding  overseas.\r\n\r\nBoth   of   them  were  doctors  trained  in  foreign\r\n\r\nuniversities and, therefore, were registrable abroad,\r\n\r\none  in  Canada  and  one in the  UK.  They  did  not\r\n\r\ntherefore require certificates of good standing  from\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Defence or the  Singapore  Medical\r\n\r\nCouncil in order to register abroad. This made  their\r\n\r\nflight from Singapore easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta will recollect that in July\r\n\r\nlast year he questioned me on the number of Singapore\r\n\r\ndoctors  who  were  registered in foreign  countries.\r\n\r\n(Hansard, dated 23.7.76, cols. 983-5). I  could  not\r\n\r\nthen  give  him an accurate answer but  provided  the\r\n\r\nHouse  with information on the number of certificates\r\n\r\nissued from 1973 to 1976. I have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsince examined the problem and discovered that it  is\r\n\r\nnot   obligatory  under  the  written  law  for  such\r\n\r\ncertificates  of good standing to be issued  at  all.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, such  certificates  have  been   issued\r\n\r\nfreely without the applicant providing evidence  that\r\n\r\nhe is of good standing during his period of practice.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  every  doctor who has  just  finished  his\r\n\r\nhousemanship if he asks, will be automatically  given\r\n\r\na  Certificate of Good Standing. This, of course,  is\r\n\r\nan  extraordinary  position. I feel  that  in  future\r\n\r\napplicants will have to prove that they are  of  good\r\n\r\nstanding, and I do not see how good standing  can  be\r\n\r\nproved unless the applicant has at least three  years\r\n\r\nof  practice, either in the private or public sector,\r\n\r\nto   show  his  competency.  A  Certificate  of  Good\r\n\r\nStanding  as  I  see it, is like a testimonial,  very\r\n\r\nmuch  like  one  given on behalf of a person  by  his\r\n\r\nreferee  to  a prospective employer. I can  say  from\r\n\r\nexperience   that   not  all  referees   write   good\r\n\r\ntestimonials.  Any  doctor  who  wishes  to  register\r\n\r\noverseas   can   produce  his  own   Certificate   of\r\n\r\nRegistration  in Singapore. But we are  going  beyond\r\n\r\nour  obligations  to issue so-called Certificates  of\r\n\r\nGood Standing to every applicant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to this problem of doctors who move\r\n\r\nout of the Ministry of Health into private practice,\r\n\r\nbecause  it does hurt the Ministry. I think I  ought\r\n\r\nto  expound  a  little. There are many  reasons  why\r\n\r\ndoctors  move  out. Some of the major reasons  which\r\n\r\nhave  been listed by private practitioners who  once\r\n\r\nupon a time worked in the public sector are:-\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    Job is not challenging.\r\n\r\n    No opportunity for promotion.\r\n\r\n    Poor physical working environment.\r\n\r\n    Poor salary\r\n\r\n    Poor staff relationship.\r\n\r\n    Inability to get requested postings.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  are  the major reasons. The other reasons  are\r\n\r\nthat  they  have got more freedom and that  they  are\r\n\r\nable  to  do  other  business. Obviously,  we  cannot\r\n\r\nsatisfy  anyone or everyone because of  the  numerous\r\n\r\nreasons that have been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me deal with some of these reasons. In\r\n\r\nthe case of salaries and promotions, I would like  to\r\n\r\nsay this for the information of Members of the House.\r\n\r\nIn  the  Soviet Union doctors are paid less than  the\r\n\r\nordinary  industrial  worker. Doctors  are  paid  120\r\n\r\nroubles per month. The industrial worker is paid  162\r\n\r\nroubles  per  month  because he  is  the  person  who\r\n\r\nproduces  the  goods. And the rate  of  inflation  of\r\n\r\nretail prices has been kept at 2% in the USSR.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  suggesting that Singapore can operate  like  the\r\n\r\nUSSR  because we are an open economy. There is a free\r\n\r\nmarket here and we operate on free market rules.  But\r\n\r\nbearing  in  mind  that expenditure  for  the  health\r\n\r\nservices has increased by 300% in five years, and now\r\n\r\nour  health  expenditure is as high as 1.15%  of  the\r\n\r\nGNP,  I  think it is very difficult indeed to satisfy\r\n\r\ndoctors or to match doctors' salaries with what  they\r\n\r\ncan  earn  as private practitioners. By  the  time  a\r\n\r\nChinese newspaper editor comes to the conclusion that\r\n\r\nthe  private  practitioner can earn two to  10  times\r\n\r\nthat  of a Government doctor, I do not see how it  is\r\n\r\npossible  for the Minister for Finance to agree  that\r\n\r\nthe immediate solution to the shortage of doctors  in\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Health is to proportionately increase\r\n\r\ntheir  salaries. It will lead to a demand for similar\r\n\r\nincreases   among  other  professional   staff   - the\r\n\r\nlawyers,   the   architects,   the   engineers,   the\r\n\r\naccountants and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this score, therefore, I can say that little can\r\n\r\nbe  done but on promotion something can be done. I am\r\n\r\nin  sympathy with those doctors who have  worked  for\r\n\r\nmany  years  in the Ministry of Health. I think  they\r\n\r\ndeserve consideration for promotion although they may\r\n\r\nnot   have  a  post-graduate  qualification.   I   am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that  medicine is still  an  art  acquired\r\n\r\nthrough  experience and medicine relies  on  clinical\r\n\r\njudgement, which  again  is  based  on  experience.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  by virtue of this experience,  I  believe\r\n\r\nthat   those   with  eight  years'  service   deserve\r\n\r\nconsideration for promotion regardless  of  the  fact\r\n\r\nthey  do  not have a higher qualification. After  all\r\n\r\nmany  civil service administrators have been promoted\r\n\r\nnot because they have a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPh.D  or  any  other  higher  university  degree  but\r\n\r\nbecause   of  their  experience  and  their  personal\r\n\r\ncapability.  I  think, likewise, the  same  criterion\r\n\r\nshould be applied to doctors. However, this does  not\r\n\r\nmean  that  we are discouraging doctors who  wish  to\r\n\r\nimprove their knowledge and learning by taking higher\r\n\r\nexaminations.  On the contrary, the present  practice\r\n\r\nof  awarding doctors with allowances, if they hold  a\r\n\r\nhigher qualification, should be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of poor staff relationship, this is\r\n\r\na  point  which  I am afraid the Minister  is  in  no\r\n\r\nposition to handle. Staff relationship has got to  do\r\n\r\nwith  doctors and doctors. Some doctors are soloists.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that some doctors who go into private\r\n\r\npractice  do  not  practise as a group  but  practise\r\n\r\nsolo.  So also, I feel that such people will not  fit\r\n\r\ninto  a  team  in a hospital because  in  a  hospital\r\n\r\ndoctors are required to work as a team. Once they are\r\n\r\nin  a team there is a hierarchy. The junior doctor or\r\n\r\nmedical   officer  has  to  take  orders   from   the\r\n\r\nRegistrar, who   takes  orders  from   the   Senior\r\n\r\nRegistrar, and  who in turn takes  orders  from  the\r\n\r\nConsultant,  and  so  on. There is  a  \"hen  pecking\"\r\n\r\norder.  It  is  very much like what you  get  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Armed Forces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned indeed that the man at the top should\r\n\r\nbe sound headed and competent so that he can hold his\r\n\r\nteam  together. I would be very worried indeed if  we\r\n\r\ndo  not  try  to bring up a generation  of  gurus  or\r\n\r\nteachers  who  can  collect  around  them  disciples.\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  through  their  leadership  that   a\r\n\r\ntradition  can  be  built in the hospitals.  If  each\r\n\r\ndoctor looks after his own interest, I am afraid  all\r\n\r\nmedical  traditions will disappear.  It  is  not  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  or the private medical  practitioner\r\n\r\nwho  is  setting tradition in Singapore, or standards\r\n\r\nif  I may add. It is those who work in the hospitals,\r\n\r\nin  the  University  units, who  have  a  very  large\r\n\r\nresponsibility for collecting disciples around  them,\r\n\r\nfor  building a medical school. And you can  only  do\r\n\r\nthat  if  there are good gurus. So long as we  search\r\n\r\nfor  good gurus and as long as there is hope that  we\r\n\r\ncan  find good gurus, I think they ought to  be  duly\r\n\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am afraid doctors are difficult persons to\r\n\r\ndeal  with, like  lawyers. You know,  lawyers  never\r\n\r\nagree  with each other. So also, doctors rarely agree\r\n\r\nwith  their diagnoses or even their treatments.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  both lawyers and doctors have one  thing  in\r\n\r\ncommon - plenty of words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason why they leave is that the job is\r\n\r\nnot  challenging and that they are unable  to  get  a\r\n\r\nrequested  posting.  I have discovered  that  doctors\r\n\r\nhave been posted by computers. I believe this is  not\r\n\r\na  clever  idea. For one thing, the man who  did  the\r\n\r\nprogramming had left the Ministry. Circumstances have\r\n\r\nchanged  and there is nobody to change the programme.\r\n\r\nSo the computer is operating on old yardsticks for  a\r\n\r\nnew  generation of doctors. So wrong people are being\r\n\r\nposted  to  the  wrong places. For instance,  when  I\r\n\r\nvisited Woodbridge Hospital I was greeted by a  young\r\n\r\nmedical  officer. Far from smiling at me,  he  grimly\r\n\r\ntold  me  \"I want another posting.\" Looking into  the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  made on the inability to  get  the  right\r\n\r\nposting,  I  have  suggested  to  my  officers   that\r\n\r\nhenceforth  the  posting  of  doctors  will  be  made\r\n\r\naccording  to where vacancies occur, so that  when  a\r\n\r\nperson applies for a job he knows what he is in  for.\r\n\r\nI  would  rather  have happy doctors working  in  the\r\n\r\nright  places than reluctant doctors in the  service,\r\n\r\nbecause they will demoralise the whole service. These\r\n\r\nare the gripers and grumblers who will collect around\r\n\r\nthem  dissidents  and who keep on pressing  home  the\r\n\r\npoint that there is no job satisfaction. A doctor  is\r\n\r\na doctor. If a doctor cannot find satisfaction in his\r\n\r\njob,   then  obviously  he  has  chosen  the   wrong\r\n\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were given the responsibility of having to\r\n\r\nbuild a completely new medical school in a completely\r\n\r\nnew country, I would insist that all those who aspire\r\n\r\nto  enter medical school should do a spell of nursing\r\n\r\nfor  two years. As it is, entering medical school  is\r\n\r\nlike  first passing your GCE \"O\" Level, then the  \"A\"\r\n\r\nlevel, then the first MBBS and then the second  MBBS:\r\n\r\na  series  of passing examinations. Medical  students\r\n\r\nhave  little  concept  that  their  profession  is  a\r\n\r\nvocation and even among nurses there is a 20%\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndropout  during the training period. I am quite  sure\r\n\r\nthat  if  we  ask  those who wish to  be  trained  as\r\n\r\ndoctors  to do a spell in nursing, some of them  will\r\n\r\nchange  their  minds after they have gone  through  a\r\n\r\nperiod of nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more particularly concerned because last year\r\n\r\n50%  of medical students in the first year are girls.\r\n\r\nSo  this is going to pose a genuine problem, not only\r\n\r\nfor  my Ministry but for the Ministry of Defence. The\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Defence  requires  male  doctors   for\r\n\r\nnational  service. So if there are less male doctors.\r\n\r\nthere  are  going  to  be less doctors  for  national\r\n\r\nservice.  Since  the lady doctors have  prospects  of\r\n\r\ngetting married and bringing up a family, in the  end\r\n\r\nwe  might  not  be  having the  effective  number  of\r\n\r\nmaterial whom we can recruit as doctors, particularly\r\n\r\nwhen  the  experience of Britain shows that at  least\r\n\r\n15%  to  20%  of  female  doctors  are  lost  to  the\r\n\r\nprofession. This is a point which I ought to bring to\r\n\r\nthe  attention of the House because it  is  food  for\r\n\r\nthought  and  I am just thinking what I ought  to  do\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to future intake of students  into  the\r\n\r\nMedical School and how I ought to correspond with the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be truthful, I believe there is a trend among the\r\n\r\nyounger generation. This is a new trend which we  did\r\n\r\nnot  see  20  years' ago. In the 50s I remember  some\r\n\r\ncolleagues  of  mine who retired from the  University\r\n\r\nService as doctors did not collect enough from  their\r\n\r\npension  or the Provident Fund to buy a house.  These\r\n\r\ndays  the young doctor who graduates immediately asks\r\n\r\nfor  a house.

Firstly, I would like to find out the\r\n\r\nexact  position of a Singapore citizen who is married\r\n\r\nto a non-Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncitizen  but a permanent resident. They were  married\r\n\r\nwith  the  permission of the Labour Office. The  wife\r\n\r\nwho  was pregnant went to a hospital here to have her\r\n\r\nbaby.  Why was the husband asked to pay a deposit  of\r\n\r\n$2,000 if he can afford it? If he cannot, why has  he\r\n\r\ngot  to pay $60 for a class C ward? That is my  first\r\n\r\nquestion.   I   may  be  wrong  but  I   would   like\r\n\r\nclarification on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have a situation in Singapore where in\r\n\r\nthe  last  two  years  there seems  to  be  a  little\r\n\r\nencouragement  on  breast feeding. The  situation  is\r\n\r\nthat  a  nurse will go up to the mother and ask,  \"Do\r\n\r\nyou want to breast feed or bottle feed your baby?\" If\r\n\r\nthe mother says \"bottle feed\", a bottle is given; and\r\n\r\nif  she  says  \"breast feed\", breast  is  given!  But\r\n\r\nunfortunately the nurses are really not aware of what\r\n\r\nconstitutes breast milk. They actively discourage the\r\n\r\nmothers  from  giving the colostrum, the  first  flow\r\n\r\nfrom  the breast, to the baby because it is  not  the\r\n\r\ncolour  of milk. They discourage the mothers  because\r\n\r\nthey  say  it  is no good. If you read last  Sunday's\r\n\r\nSunday Nation about X factors and also about what  is\r\n\r\nin  the colostrum, it is good for the baby. It  helps\r\n\r\nto give immunity to the baby. Why is the hospital not\r\n\r\nactively  encouraging breast feeding?  In  the  olden\r\n\r\ndays  we  had no problem. In my younger days  mothers\r\n\r\nused  to  breast feed their babies in  buses.  Today,\r\n\r\nwith  modern commercialisation of tinned milk,  young\r\n\r\nmothers  are  now  ashamed of feeding  the  baby  the\r\n\r\nnatural way. There are so many good things in  breast\r\n\r\nmilk and yet our hospitals discourage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this from first hand. In the last three\r\n\r\nmonths  two  of my sisters have given birth,  and  in\r\n\r\nboth  cases they were discouraged from giving  breast\r\n\r\nmilk.  I  am  surprised at this. We should  encourage\r\n\r\nmothers  to give breast milk to their babies  because\r\n\r\nof the very many factors that are helpful to both the\r\n\r\nmother and the baby. The baby will get immunity  from\r\n\r\ntaking  the  natural mother's milk  and  the  mother,\r\n\r\ncontrary to some myth, will regain her figure faster,\r\n\r\nSo  I  am quite surprised that breast feeding is  not\r\n\r\nbeing encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, which is again quite surprising to\r\n\r\nme, is  that after both my sisters have given birth,\r\n\r\nthere  came a lady dressed as a nurse and unsolicited\r\n\r\n(we do not know who she is). She said, \"I am a mother-care  nurse\".  She  came in, weighed  the  baby,  and\r\n\r\nimmediately tried to sell a brand-named milk. I  want\r\n\r\nto  know  how  this milk company got  the  names  and\r\n\r\naddresses  of the mothers. I thought that  the  names\r\n\r\nand  addresses given to the hospital are confidential\r\n\r\nand should not be given to anybody who asks for them.\r\n\r\nSo how did their names get to the milk company? These\r\n\r\npeople are dressed as nurses, and a woman who is  not\r\n\r\nfairly  well educated may think that they are  nurses\r\n\r\nand  are giving good advice about giving tinned  milk\r\n\r\nor  formula  milk to the baby. She might  immediately\r\n\r\nchange from breast feeding to tinned milk which is, I\r\n\r\nthink, rather undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a group willing to teach young mothers how\r\n\r\nto  breast feed before they go to hospital to deliver\r\n\r\ntheir babies. It may sound ridiculous that mothers do\r\n\r\nnot  know  how  to breast feed, but it is  true  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  certain problems associated  with  breast\r\n\r\nfeeding.  This  group  is  willing  to  teach  breast\r\n\r\nfeeding  and yet I understand that it is not  getting\r\n\r\nany  encouragement  from the  hospital.  In  fact,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that one hospital medical  superintendent\r\n\r\nis  definitely hostile to the group that he would not\r\n\r\nallow  any of its members into the hospital to  teach\r\n\r\nthe  young mothers how to breast feed. I am wondering\r\n\r\nwhy  there  is this hostility towards breast  feeding\r\n\r\nwhich is a natural thing to do. If God meant to  give\r\n\r\nthe  baby  cow's  milk, then He would  do  away  with\r\n\r\nbreasts  for  women! I would be most obliged  if  the\r\n\r\nHon.

Unfortunately,  this  interpretation  has\r\n\r\nbeen  applied  even to those who hold Singapore  blue\r\n\r\nidentity  cards. It does not make sense  indeed  that\r\n\r\npermanent residents who hold Singapore blue  identity\r\n\r\ncards  but do not work are charged residential  rates\r\n\r\nwhereas  those who are willing to work and hold  work\r\n\r\npermits  are  charged nonresidential  rates.  I  have\r\n\r\nreviewed  the  matter and decided that  henceforth  a\r\n\r\npermanent resident holding a blue Singapore  identity\r\n\r\ncard regardless of whether he holds a work permit  or\r\n\r\nan Employment Pass and who is the wife of a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  will be charged the same hospital  rates  as\r\n\r\nfor residents in all obstetric cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second point on breast feeding, I\r\n\r\ncannot remember whether all of us were brought up  on\r\n\r\nmother's milk. But at least I assume some of  us  are\r\n\r\nwell  aware  of the campaign conducted by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Potong Pasir, He is a great enthusiast for breast\r\n\r\nfeeding, excepting that I have to remind him \"that is\r\n\r\nmeant for kids only\". I am not aware that any of  the\r\n\r\nobstetric departments in our hospitals are hostile to\r\n\r\nthe  practice of breast feeding. In fact, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Potong Pasir is very pleased indeed with the milk\r\n\r\nbank that we have helped him to establish.

Unlike\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Kim Seng, I am a layman  in  medical\r\n\r\naffairs  but even a layman knows that health  service\r\n\r\nis  labour-intensive and its quality  hinges  on  the\r\n\r\navailability   of   suitably   qualified   personnel,\r\n\r\nparticularly doctors. With due respect to the  press,\r\n\r\nlaymen  also  know that press reports  based  on  so-called  reliable  sources  often  turn  out   to   be\r\n\r\nunreliable.  Could  the  Hon.  Minister  for   Health\r\n\r\ntherefore  enlighten  us as  to  the  true  situation\r\n\r\nregarding  the reported mass resignation  of  doctors\r\n\r\nfrom  the  medical  service and whether  or  not  the\r\n\r\nproblem  of \"mob hysteria\" exists. Having  asked  the\r\n\r\nquestion,  Sir,I  hope I would  not  end  up  in  a\r\n\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, the Member for Marine Parade\r\n\r\nhas  raised  a  very important question.  Firstly,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to congratulate him on his sharp  eye  in\r\n\r\ndetecting  the  enormous difference  in  the  subhead\r\n\r\nunder  Singapore General Hospital for  the  financial\r\n\r\nyear  1977-78. I must confess it was a ghastly error.\r\n\r\nAn  investigation  has shown that  in  reality  $0.368\r\n\r\nmillion  is  intended  for  annual  increments,   the\r\n\r\nbalance of $1.797 million was to cover 606 new  posts\r\n\r\nproposed by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explanation given to me was that most of the\r\n\r\nnew  posts proposed were not approved by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  when the Estimates were submitted  under\r\n\r\nsubhead  BAA 1101, and because of clerical  oversight\r\n\r\nit  was  too late to adjust the provision  since  the\r\n\r\nEstimates had already been finalised and printed. The\r\n\r\nerror would be rectified\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadministratively by freezing the excess provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, on the second point with regard to the question\r\n\r\nof  the  resignation of doctors - I  think  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of what the Member for  Kim  Seng,  the\r\n\r\nMember for Anson and the Member for Punggol have said\r\n\r\na little while ago, and so may I continue with what I\r\n\r\nsaid  a little while ago before? While I do not  want\r\n\r\nto appear to be harsh in my judgment of the attitudes\r\n\r\nof  the younger generation, I think it is fair enough\r\n\r\nthat we should try to be as objective as possible  in\r\n\r\nour estimation of trends. I made a speech at a dinner\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks  ago in which I stated that about  60%  of\r\n\r\ndoctors  had resigned with less than three  years  of\r\n\r\nservice.  I  am  afraid it was  a  very  conservative\r\n\r\nestimate.  I should have qualified that statement  by\r\n\r\nsaying  that  at  least  60%  had  resigned.  I  have\r\n\r\nexamined  the  trend and I would like to  inform  the\r\n\r\nHouse  of  what I have discovered. The percentage  of\r\n\r\ndoctors resigning within three years was:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n          1972   ...   44%\r\n\r\n          1973   ...   65%\r\n\r\n          1974   ...   69%\r\n\r\n          1975   ...   74%\r\n\r\n          1976   ...   73%\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>So  there is a clear-cut trend, and not to understand\r\n\r\nthis trend means that we will forever be chasing  our\r\n\r\ntails  and  listening  to  complaints  made  by   the\r\n\r\ndoctors' union on inadequate salaries, unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nconditions  of  service, and so on. I have  indicated\r\n\r\nearlier  that the eagerness to enjoy the good  things\r\n\r\nin life exists among our younger generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of private practice, market forces of\r\n\r\nsupply and demand apply. We all like to believe  that\r\n\r\nour  doctors  are  serving  only  the  population  of\r\n\r\nSingapore of 2.3 million permanent inhabitants.  This\r\n\r\nis  not  really so. There were 1.5 million  transient\r\n\r\nvisitors  last  year, plus another 120,000  estimated\r\n\r\nfloating population of expatriates. In other words, I\r\n\r\nput  it that the doctor-population ratio in Singapore\r\n\r\nis  less than what it is. Therefore, as long as there\r\n\r\nis  a demand and as long as members of the public  or\r\n\r\neven visitors are prepared to pay the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprices which the private practitioners call for,  the\r\n\r\nexodus  from  the Ministry of Health  will  continue.\r\n\r\nHence. I have suggested earlier that there is a clear-cut  distinction  between migration and  leaving  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Health for private practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as migration is concerned, it is very\r\n\r\ndifficult   to   control  the   doctors,   short   of\r\n\r\nwithholding their passports. I do not think that  can\r\n\r\nbe  done.  But there is no reason at all, as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier, why the Ministry  of  Health  or  the\r\n\r\nMedical  Council  should ever  give  an  applicant  a\r\n\r\nCertificate  of Good Standing when there  is  nothing\r\n\r\nunder the law to say that this should be done. On the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   I  have  appealed  for  institutional\r\n\r\nloyalty. I am rather amazed or stunned by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Jalan Kayu when he suggested that it is pointless\r\n\r\nto  appeal to the doctor's loyalty and that he  would\r\n\r\nrather  pay them. This is suggesting that all doctors\r\n\r\nare  mercenary  and  that  they  have  got  no  other\r\n\r\ninstincts. I do not believe that all doctors are  the\r\n\r\nsame  and  there can be no institutional loyalty.  My\r\n\r\nfear  is that the young doctors are leaving too early\r\n\r\nfor their own good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Toh, it is guillotine time for your\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir,I am happy with the partial\r\n\r\nreply  given  by the Minister for Health.

Every  time they visit a  foreign  country\r\n\r\nsome  sort of social, economic and regional agreement\r\n\r\nwith  the country seems to result, and in most  cases\r\n\r\nthe  agreement  is more or less in our favour.  Their\r\n\r\nvisits  have charted our little nation in  the  world\r\n\r\nmap  as  an important nation in this region. This  is\r\n\r\nindeed remarkable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to know what are our overseas\r\n\r\nmissions   doing  besides  looking  after  passports,\r\n\r\nvisas,   and  encouraging  tourism  and   trade   for\r\n\r\nSingapore? Are they advertising Singapore through our\r\n\r\nmissions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Foreign Ministry has stated that the major\r\n\r\npowers  would  treat  our  region  as  an  \"area   of\r\n\r\ncontest\".  Except  for  Japan and  China,  the  other\r\n\r\npowers no longer regard Southeast Asia as crucial  to\r\n\r\ntheir  interest, as it once was. But then  the  major\r\n\r\nindustrial  powers are important to us  economically.\r\n\r\nTheir  investment  markets and their  technology  are\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  our continued economic  progress.  In\r\n\r\nline  with this statement. I wonder what the Ministry\r\n\r\nhas  done so far or what it intends to do in the near\r\n\r\nfuture for the benefit of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ASEAN Secretariat in which Singapore is\r\n\r\ninvolved  was  formed sometime  ago.  I  gather  from\r\n\r\nreports that the Secretariat is not fully functioning\r\n\r\nin  Jakarta. What is happening to the Secretariat? Is\r\n\r\nSingapore fulfilling its role in the Secretariat and,\r\n\r\nif so, to what extent?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, we seem to hear numerous news about our\r\n\r\nconnection  with the other ASEAN countries.  This  is\r\n\r\nindeed important for our progress and survival of our\r\n\r\nnation and region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what has happened to our relationship with\r\n\r\nthe  Commonwealth countries? Sometime ago we had  the\r\n\r\npleasure of hosting the Commonwealth Conference  here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, but after that we seem  to  hear  less\r\n\r\nabout  our connections with the Commonwealth nations.\r\n\r\nWhy  is this so? Is there any intensive dialogue with\r\n\r\nthe Commonwealth nations for the economic, social and\r\n\r\nregional benefit of our country. Or are we neglecting\r\n\r\nour  interest with these countries? Can the  Minister\r\n\r\ncomment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Budget Estimate there is a sum of\r\n\r\n$82,000 allocated for Foreign Service Training. May I\r\n\r\nknow  what  is this training all about, and  who  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in the training?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, under the Expenditure on Manpower, I notice\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry is finding it difficult to recruit\r\n\r\nstaff for our various overseas missions. Why is  this\r\n\r\nso?  Is there a barrier in the selection of the staff\r\n\r\nor  is it because there is a lack of response to this\r\n\r\nMinistry?  As  far as I understand,  there  are  many\r\n\r\npeople  in  the  civil service  who  would  not  mind\r\n\r\noffering  their  services in  the  Foreign  Ministry.\r\n\r\nCould the Minister explain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, according\r\n\r\nto the Memorandum on the Main Estimates there are two\r\n\r\ndecreases  in  the Ministry. Under EOM,  there  is  a\r\n\r\ndecrease  of $1.02 million and under OOE, a  decrease\r\n\r\nof $1.00 million. The reason given is that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`no financial provision has been entered for the new\r\n\r\nposts  and  vacancies .., in view of the difficulties\r\n\r\nin recruiting staff for the various Missions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir, it seems to me that the Ministry has made up its\r\n\r\nmind  not  to recruit any new staff for the vacancies\r\n\r\nin  the  various missions by not making any financial\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  new  financial  year.  Sir,  the\r\n\r\nreduced  budget only serves to give those  who  would\r\n\r\nlike  to make foreign service their career the  wrong\r\n\r\nimpression  that there is no future  in  joining  the\r\n\r\nforeign   service.  I  wonder  whether  our   foreign\r\n\r\nservices will be weakened by this reduced budget.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister has said in his 1977\r\n\r\nBudget Statement that \"to safeguard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour  economic  interests, our trade,  investment  and\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  offices  will  be  strengthened  in   key\r\n\r\ncentres.\"  Sir, how could our diplomatic  offices  be\r\n\r\nstrengthened  by  unfilled  vacancies  and  a   total\r\n\r\ndecrease  of  about $2.00 million for the  staff  and\r\n\r\nexpenses for overseas missions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has encountered difficulties in\r\n\r\nrecruiting staff, as the Member for Anson has pointed\r\n\r\nout, over  the  years. I want to  know  whether  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  has up till now come up with  any  plan  to\r\n\r\nsolve   the  recruiting  problems  and  whether   our\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  offices in the various key  centres  have\r\n\r\nbeen  affected  by the weakened foreign  service  and\r\n\r\nshortage of diplomatic personnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as usual, the Member for Anson tries to kill\r\n\r\nmany birds with one stone.

The Foreign Service officer is expected to\r\n\r\nperform  a  varied task when serving in  one  of  our\r\n\r\noverseas  missions.  Because of  Singapore's  limited\r\n\r\nmanpower resources, each officer is expected to  pull\r\n\r\nhis  weight and pay equal attention to the  political\r\n\r\nand  economic  functions. In fact,  in  some  of  our\r\n\r\nsmaller  missions  one officer is  expected  to  look\r\n\r\nafter   many  jobs  in  connection  with  Singapore's\r\n\r\ninterests in the postings overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to mention in passing that this\r\n\r\nreminds  me of my assignment when I was in  Cairo.  I\r\n\r\nhad  only  three staff, one Third Secretary  and  one\r\n\r\nFirst   Secretary, and  we  had   to   cover   three\r\n\r\ncontinents. Egypt, Yugoslavia, Ethiopia,  Beirut  and\r\n\r\nPakistan.  So Members can be sure that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nbeen idling.

This  means   that\r\n\r\nForeign  Service officers have now to concentrate  on\r\n\r\nintensive economic monitoring of the countries  where\r\n\r\nthey  are posted to. They are expected to be  on  the\r\n\r\nalert  for  protectionistic  tendencies  as  well  as\r\n\r\nreport  on  any economic opportunities available  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question about some big powers no more\r\n\r\ninterested in this region and so what do we  do,  the\r\n\r\npresence  of  major  powers in Southeast  Asia  is  a\r\n\r\npermanent  feature  of the political  scene  in  this\r\n\r\nregion.   However,  some  powers  no  longer   regard\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia as crucial to their interests  as  it\r\n\r\nwas once. These are facts we have to live with and to\r\n\r\ntailor our foreign policy objectives accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although these powers no longer regard Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia  as crucial, they nevertheless continue  to  pay\r\n\r\nmuch  interest in the region, particularly  when  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries  have demonstrated the  benefits  of\r\n\r\nforeign  investment in the region.  Our  task  is  to\r\n\r\nensure   that   such  interest  is   maintained   and\r\n\r\nincreased.  To this end, the Government has  embarked\r\n\r\non  a  range of activities which include the despatch\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  trade missions and  the  reception  of\r\n\r\nforeign  business  delegations.  For  instance,   our\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Foreign  Affairs  will  personally  be\r\n\r\nheading  an  economic delegation of 20 persons  early\r\n\r\nnext  month to Brussels where a high level conference\r\n\r\nwill  be  held. This conference is organised  by  the\r\n\r\nEuropean   Economic  Commission  and   the   European\r\n\r\nInternational  Bank and will be attended  by  leading\r\n\r\nbusiness   magnates  of  Western  Europe  and   ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we have publicised Singapore's\r\n\r\nattractions   by  such  means  as  inviting   foreign\r\n\r\njournalists to our country. For instance, a group  of\r\n\r\nSwiss  journalists  were  invited  to  Singapore   in\r\n\r\nconjunction with the recent flotation of  a  loan  in\r\n\r\nthe Swiss money market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, my Ministry is posting high\r\n\r\ncalibre officers to key overseas missions.

There  is  potentially\r\n\r\ngreat  benefits to be gained from these dialogues  in\r\n\r\nterms  of greater investment, transfer of skills  and\r\n\r\ntechnology and access to new markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the third question of ASEAN\r\n\r\nSecretariat, we have only recently made two important\r\n\r\ndecisions  by the ASEAN Standing Committee which  set\r\n\r\nup  the  ASEAN Secretariat in motion. These  are  the\r\n\r\napproval  of the budget for the Secretariat  and  the\r\n\r\nappointment of senior staff to the Secretariat  on  a\r\n\r\nrotational  basis  in alphabetical  order.  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill continue to actively support the efforts of  the\r\n\r\nASEAN   Secretary-General.   General   Dharsono    of\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  to  develop  the  Secretariat   into   an\r\n\r\neffective organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth question deals with the Commonwealth. I\r\n\r\ncan  assure  the Member for Anson that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nneglected  the Commonwealth. In fact, our  ties  with\r\n\r\nmember-countries are increasing both on  a  bilateral\r\n\r\nand  multi-lateral basis. Let me give some  instances\r\n\r\nof  the  importance  we  continue  to  place  on  our\r\n\r\nCommonwealth links. Since the Commonwealth  Heads  of\r\n\r\nGovernment meeting was hosted by us here in Singapore\r\n\r\nin  1971, the  Prime Minister and the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs have attended biennial gatherings  in\r\n\r\nOttawa and Jamaica. This year they will again  go  to\r\n\r\nLondon  where  the  meeting will  coincide  with  the\r\n\r\nSilver Jubilee of the Queen's accession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore provides financial support to the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth   Secretariat, particularly   to   the\r\n\r\nCommonwealth  Fund  for Technical  Co-operation.  The\r\n\r\nCFTC has helped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   to   acquire   new   skills    through\r\n\r\nCommonwealth fellowships in national development. Our\r\n\r\ncash  contributions and fellowship awards also go  to\r\n\r\nthe    Commonwealth   Institute   and    Commonwealth\r\n\r\nFoundation.  As  part  of the Commonwealth  Technical\r\n\r\nAssistance  and Cooperation. Singapore has  over  the\r\n\r\nyears  received  and  trained  many  nationals   from\r\n\r\nAfrica,  Papua New Guinea. Fiji and Sri  Lanka  among\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Kingston meeting in 1975, the Commonwealth\r\n\r\nHeads of Government set up a body of economic experts\r\n\r\nto  examine ways in which the association can help in\r\n\r\nbridging the gap between the rich and poor countries.\r\n\r\nA separate group of industrial specialists was formed\r\n\r\nwith  10  members. Singapore was represented in  this\r\n\r\nselect group. The findings of these specialists  will\r\n\r\nbe considered by the Commonwealth Heads of Government\r\n\r\nin June this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another level, Commonwealth Ministers meet\r\n\r\nregularly on a variety of issues; monetary,  economic\r\n\r\ndevelopment, trade,  law and so  forth.  At  various\r\n\r\ninternational   forums,   Commonwealth    delegations\r\n\r\nexchange  views,  try  to  coordinate  positions  and\r\n\r\nminimise contentions. Yesterday, the 14th March, was\r\n\r\nthe  first  time  Commonwealth Day was simultaneously\r\n\r\nobserved  by all the 36 member-states. In  Singapore.\r\n\r\nall  schools  observed the occasion on  the  11th  as\r\n\r\nschool  vacation started on 12th March.  Competitions\r\n\r\nand  exhibitions  were organised. My  colleague,  the\r\n\r\nMinister    for   Education.,   issued   a    special\r\n\r\nCommonwealth Day Message. Tonight after this session.\r\n\r\nI  have been invited by the Commonwealth Society to a\r\n\r\nreception.  So  Members can  see  that  we  have  not\r\n\r\nneglected the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Over-worked!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question\r\n\r\nof  recruitment  and training of diplomats,  this  is\r\n\r\nquite a difficult problem for us because recruiting a\r\n\r\ndiplomat is not an\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n               \r\n\r\neasy    matter.   There   are   so   many   stringent\r\n\r\nrequirements. First of all, personality. A diplomat's\r\n\r\nsuccess wherever he may be depends to a large  extent\r\n\r\nupon  the  way he cultivates friendship and  develops\r\n\r\ncontacts.  This  in turn is related directly  to  the\r\n\r\npersonality characteristics of the diplomat  and  his\r\n\r\nspouse. He should possess both social graces as  well\r\n\r\nas  a  friendly,  pleasant and outgoing  personality.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  integrity  and  loyalty.  A  diplomat   is\r\n\r\nentrusted  with the nation's plans and secrets.  This\r\n\r\ngreat confidence which is entrusted in him must never\r\n\r\nbe  violated.  Therefore, he must be a  person  whose\r\n\r\nintegrity  and loyalty is beyond question.  Then,  we\r\n\r\nneed  someone with knowledge of sensitivity. He  must\r\n\r\nbe  able  to  understand strange customs, traditions,\r\n\r\nideology  which  are  fundamental  to  each  overseas\r\n\r\nassignment.  The  officer  must  be  alert   to   the\r\n\r\npsychological  sensitivity  of  foreigners  and  must\r\n\r\navoid  unwittingly insulting or offending them.  This\r\n\r\ncalls  for tact and discretion of the highest  level.\r\n\r\nThen  he must have good judgment because in terms  of\r\n\r\ncrises, when he is under pressure, he must be counted\r\n\r\non  to  think clearly and to make correct  decisions.\r\n\r\nFaulty  judgments can jeopardise the  interest  of  a\r\n\r\nnation.  Therefore, there can be no substitution  for\r\n\r\nclarity of thought and judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The qualities enumerated above are universally\r\n\r\nconsidered to be professionally necessary.  They  are\r\n\r\nexacting  qualities and, therefore, the  standard  of\r\n\r\nselection has to be high. For these reasons, we  have\r\n\r\nnot  been able to select sufficient suitable  persons\r\n\r\nfor  appointment  to the Foreign Service.  Among  the\r\n\r\nsteps  we have taken in our recruitment exercise  are\r\n\r\ntalent  scouting within the civil service and in  the\r\n\r\nuniversities and perhaps maybe amongst  some  of  our\r\n\r\ncolleagues and we hope when their services are called\r\n\r\nupon they will not shrink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Joe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Apart from this, a diplomat also\r\n\r\nhas   to   make  certain  sacrifices,  such  as   the\r\n\r\ndisruption of his children's education by  reason  of\r\n\r\nhis being transferred\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nfrom  one  posting to another; and then the  adequate\r\n\r\njob  opportunities and good living in  Singapore,  in\r\n\r\ncontrast  with  the inconvenient and  unsettled  life\r\n\r\nassociated with the job in the Foreign Service.  Such\r\n\r\nreservations against joining the Foreign Service  are\r\n\r\nexpected  to  be diminished with time as the  Foreign\r\n\r\nService  develops and the challenges  and  honour  of\r\n\r\nrepresenting Singapore overseas are fully realised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the $82,000-question put forward by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson,  I have just mentioned the difficulty  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting  diplomats and we have  been  taking  some\r\n\r\nsteps  to  train  diplomats. We have organised  basic\r\n\r\nadministration courses for Attaches conducted by  the\r\n\r\nCivil Service Staff Development Institute which  take\r\n\r\nabout  10  full days. Then we have basic courses  for\r\n\r\nForeign  Service officers giving them  the  craft  of\r\n\r\ndiplomacy,  political, economic,  consular,  protocol\r\n\r\nfunctions  for diplomats serving abroad.  The  course\r\n\r\nwill  take  eight days and are conducted by lecturers\r\n\r\nat  the University of Singapore. Trainees will attend\r\n\r\ncourses    on    international   law,   international\r\n\r\nrelations, economics, contemporary history. This will\r\n\r\ntake  three  months. And then they  need  to  undergo\r\n\r\nlanguage  training. In 1976, a total of  43  officers\r\n\r\nwere  reimbursed with tuition fees under the  foreign\r\n\r\nlanguage  scheme. Then trainees are given  on-the-job\r\n\r\ntraining  where  they are trained in headquarters  or\r\n\r\nattached  to  the various Ministries or to  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  for briefings. And also overseas attachments.\r\n\r\nThis is a full-time two-month course where an officer\r\n\r\nis  attached to an overseas mission. Or alternatively\r\n\r\nhe   is   sent  to  attend  conferences   to   gather\r\n\r\nexperience.  Apart  from that,  we  also  have  taken\r\n\r\nadvantage of the following overseas courses  extended\r\n\r\nby   various   governments  to  the  Public   Service\r\n\r\nCommission,  The Australian Foreign Service  training\r\n\r\ncourse  duration  is  five months;  the  New  Zealand\r\n\r\nForeign  Service course duration is six  months;  and\r\n\r\nthe  French  Government  scholarship  is  a  two-year\r\n\r\ncourse  comprising a French language course  and  the\r\n\r\ndiplomacy  course at the International  Institute  of\r\n\r\nPublic Administration in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Delta asked\r\n\r\nwhy  we  did  not  fill  the  provision,  giving  the\r\n\r\nimpression that there is no future for diplomats. One\r\n\r\nof  the  main reasons for the reduction  of  the  EOM\r\n\r\nprovision  for  the  Financial  Year  1977   is   the\r\n\r\ninability  to  fill the large number of vacancies  in\r\n\r\nthe Foreign Service. I have explained why we found it\r\n\r\ndifficult  to  fill the vacancies. The  prospects  of\r\n\r\nfilling all of them in 1977 are not very bright.  The\r\n\r\nprovision  for the 1977 EOM is based on the  salaries\r\n\r\nof  the  actual number of officers, including  normal\r\n\r\nincrements and the sum of NWC allowances for 1977. In\r\n\r\nother  words,  there is no provision of salaries  for\r\n\r\nthe  vacant  post  or  the new post  which  has  been\r\n\r\ncreated  for  the  Regional  and  Economic  Division.\r\n\r\nShould  the  need  arise in the course  of  1977, to\r\n\r\nsupplement  the  EOM provisions such amount  required\r\n\r\ncan  be vired from the OOE provisions to augment  the\r\n\r\nEOM provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned about the recruitment of officers.\r\n\r\nInsofar  as  the  Foreign Service is  concerned,  the\r\n\r\nquality  of  manpower  is  far  more  important  than\r\n\r\nquantity.  The  selection of  the  right  person  for\r\n\r\nposting  to  the right place at the right  time  will\r\n\r\nalways  be a matter of crucial importance.  It  will,\r\n\r\ntherefore, fill  the  existing  vacancies  when  the\r\n\r\npersons are found. I am not optimistic, however, that\r\n\r\nall  the vacancies will be filled during this  period\r\n\r\nand in order not to unnecessarily inflate the budget,\r\n\r\nI  have  decided to reduce the EOM provisions.  Until\r\n\r\nsuch time when sufficient officers are recruited, our\r\n\r\noverseas officers will remain not fully staffed.  The\r\n\r\nresult  is that overseas officers are called upon  to\r\n\r\nwork harder and they have responded well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

Govindaswamy, Ivan Baptist and Tan Cheng San).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law prescribes limits to the payment of annual\r\n\r\nwage  supplement.  This  is  desirable  and,  indeed,\r\n\r\nimperative  in  an economy such as Singapore's  where\r\n\r\nour  progress is dominantly dependent on  inducements\r\n\r\nto  prospective investors to invest in Singapore, and\r\n\r\nto ensure that our manufactured goods are competitive\r\n\r\nin overseas markets. The rationale behind the law is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  perfectly  understandable  and  one  with\r\n\r\nwhich  our  trade  union movement will  go  along.  A\r\n\r\nbalance, however, will have to be struck between what\r\n\r\nhas  been paid before and what is to be paid  now  so\r\n\r\nthat the workers will not lose out. But it would seem\r\n\r\nthat  the law is heavily weighted against bargainable\r\n\r\nemployees   in   relation  to   the   non-bargainable\r\n\r\nemployees  particularly those who, because  of  their\r\n\r\npositions,  become non-bargainable. These are  junior\r\n\r\nexecutives   and   others  who  are  categorised   as\r\n\r\nconfidential staff and who, because of  the  type  of\r\n\r\nwork they perform, may be labelled as confidential or\r\n\r\nmanagerial,  in many instances, at the discretion  of\r\n\r\nthe management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting that such employees should not\r\n\r\nbe paid the annual wage supplement or bonus, but when\r\n\r\nthe disparity between what they are paid and what the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworkers receive becomes acutely significant, then one\r\n\r\nwonders why the non-bargainable group should be  paid\r\n\r\nsignificantly  more  than the  bargainable  group  of\r\n\r\nemployees.  I  know of many cases. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nquote  one  instance where, according to my analysis.\r\n\r\nthe   non-bargainable  category  of  executives   and\r\n\r\nconfidential staff constitutes some 14% of the  total\r\n\r\nworkforce  and have received almost 44% of the  total\r\n\r\namount  of  annual  wage supplement  or  bonus  paid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Minister for Labour and this House  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  know  that the Chairman of  this  Company's\r\n\r\nBoard of Directors is a top civil servant. I must say\r\n\r\nthat  not  all the top civil servants really practise\r\n\r\nwhat  they preach. In this company there are not less\r\n\r\nthan  888  employees.  The  company  classified   127\r\n\r\nemployees as \"managerial\" staff. In other words,  the\r\n\r\nratio  of managerial staff in this company is 1:8.  I\r\n\r\nmust  compliment  this top civil servant  who  really\r\n\r\ntrains  managerial  people in this  company  and  who\r\n\r\nreally  pays the company's managers well.  The  total\r\n\r\nannual  wage supplement paid by the company is  about\r\n\r\n$1.4  million  and the managers and the  confidential\r\n\r\nstaff  got  more  than 44%. This I  submit,  Sir,  is\r\n\r\nunjust  to the bargainable employees who fall  within\r\n\r\nthe  ambit  of  the Employment Act, while  the  non-bargainable  employees who are  not  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act enjoy enhanced benefits.  I  suggest,\r\n\r\nSir,  some acceptable limit should be imposed on  the\r\n\r\nquantum payable to such employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other matter that is a cause for concern is that\r\n\r\npertaining to the practice of granting a half-day off\r\n\r\non the eve of important festivals. Here again, I must\r\n\r\nsay that the civil servants do not practise what they\r\n\r\npreach. It is common practice for employers of white-collar  workers to grant a half-day off; and  no  one\r\n\r\nraises  an  eye-brow when this is freely  granted  to\r\n\r\nthem. But I note with some wonderment that when blue-collar  workers request for a half-pay  off  on  such\r\n\r\noccasions  they  face difficulties. I  quite  realise\r\n\r\nthat in circumstances where the work is essential  to\r\n\r\nthe  life  of  the community or when a disruption  of\r\n\r\nwork  will  have  adverse economic or social  effects\r\n\r\nthis will not be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npossible.  I must say that the organised  workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  like the transport workers  and  the  bus\r\n\r\nworkers,  are  responsible workers. We know  that  on\r\n\r\nChinese  New Year Eve we have to have family  reunion\r\n\r\ndinners but we do not go and ask for time-off. We ask\r\n\r\nonly  in  those  areas where their absence  does  not\r\n\r\ndisrupt  production  of work. In  other  words,  non-essential  areas. But where disruption of any  nature\r\n\r\nwill  not arise, it is manifestly unfair not to grant\r\n\r\nthis  facility  to blue-collar workers.  This  year's\r\n\r\nChinese  New Year eve was an instance in which  where\r\n\r\neven  Government officials seemed to be  inclined  to\r\n\r\nthe  view that requests for a half-day off from blue-collar  workers to their employers should be  treated\r\n\r\ndifferently.  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  such  a  view\r\n\r\nbecomes  incomprehensible and untenable in the  light\r\n\r\nof  the  present policy to encourage our  workers  to\r\n\r\ntake to blue-collar work. It is obvious, Sir, that if\r\n\r\nwe  continue to adopt different standards for  white-collar  workers and blue-collar workers, it  will  be\r\n\r\ndifficult to obtain the desired objective.  I  would,\r\n\r\ntherefore, like to see the application of, at  least,\r\n\r\nuniform standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, in last year's\r\n\r\nBudget   session  I  raised  the  question   of   the\r\n\r\npossibility   of  certain  companies   indulging   in\r\n\r\nunjustifiable  and unfair retrenchment exercises.  In\r\n\r\nhis  reply, the Minister of State for Labour  stated,\r\n\r\nand I quote from Hansard, Vol. 35 col. 404:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The managements of firms which intend to retrench\r\n\r\nworkers  have been advised by the Ministry of Labour,\r\n\r\nand  guidelines have been given by the  Ministry  for\r\n\r\nsuch an exercise ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been monitoring closely the\r\n\r\nretrenchment   Situation.

In  a  statement  to\r\n\r\nshareholders, the chairman of this particular company\r\n\r\nspoke in glowing terms, which I would like to quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With the momentum generated by management and the\r\n\r\nimprovement in trading conditions, the company  looks\r\n\r\nforward to the new year with some confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to mention the particular model of\r\n\r\nthe  car.  This particular model which was introduced\r\n\r\nin   October  1976  was  well  received.  The  demand\r\n\r\noutpaces  the  supply.  Then  another  make  of   car\r\n\r\ncontinues  to  achieve higher market  penetration  in\r\n\r\nboth  Singapore  and  Malaysia. Sales  of  commercial\r\n\r\nvehicles  are  improving and  the  Company  has  been\r\n\r\nsuccessful   in  penetrating  the  bus  business   in\r\n\r\nvolume.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is understandable for companies to resort to\r\n\r\na  retrenchment exercise to avoid successive  trading\r\n\r\nlosses   or  adverse  trading  conditions.  But   for\r\n\r\ncompanies to resort to retrenchment exercise  at  the\r\n\r\nexpense  of  workers, I must say, is highly  immoral.\r\n\r\nThis  brings up the question of whether the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour's monitoring system is effective enough to\r\n\r\ncounter  such  abuses and also whether employers  are\r\n\r\npaying  heed  to the Ministry's guidelines.  I  would\r\n\r\ntherefore, urge the Ministry of Labour to  look  into\r\n\r\nsuch abuses more seriously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P.

When a Singaporean wants to marry\r\n\r\na  foreigner  he has to get a permit for his  better-half  from  the Labour Ministry. In these cases  some\r\n\r\napplications have been turned down. Appeals were made\r\n\r\nby  MPs  and  they were also turned down, the  office\r\n\r\nquoting  rules  and  regulations  for  rejecting  the\r\n\r\napplications.  But  miracles seem  to  happen.  These\r\n\r\npermits were granted through some other means. How is\r\n\r\nthis  possible?  Is there some double regulation  for\r\n\r\nthe granting of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese permits? Can the Minister explain this anomaly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, turning to employment, it is observed that ex-convicts find difficulty in getting jobs. Why is this\r\n\r\nso?  If they cannot get a job, what do we expect them\r\n\r\nto  do?  Most probably, they will continue to  commit\r\n\r\ncrime.  We must not look down on ex-convicts  because\r\n\r\nthere is such a thing as turning over a new leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also observed that too many employers complain\r\n\r\nabout  job-hopping. Have we analysed the root problem\r\n\r\nof this? Do the workers job-hop merely for the fun of\r\n\r\nit?  Because  of a few isolated cases of  job-hopping\r\n\r\nwithout  good  reason, we should not condemn  workers\r\n\r\nfor   job-hopping.   Financial   incentives,   family\r\n\r\nproblems,   distance   from   home,   poor    working\r\n\r\nconditions, and unreasonable employers could  be  the\r\n\r\ncause    for    job-hopping.   In   contract    work.\r\n\r\nparticularly,  some  contractors  cheat  the  workers\r\n\r\nwherever  possible. Yet these people  go  unpunished.\r\n\r\nSome    employers    in   the   various    industrial\r\n\r\nestablishments treat workers badly. Yet they also  go\r\n\r\nunpunished.  Blaming workers for job-hopping  is  not\r\n\r\nthe    answer.   Penalising   workers   through   NWC\r\n\r\nrestrictions  may  not be the answer  to  solve  this\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote an example of a contractor who has been\r\n\r\nawarded  the  contract for cleaning services  in  the\r\n\r\nAirport.  This contractor has riot paid some  of  his\r\n\r\nworkers  for some months. However, the workers  still\r\n\r\ncarried  on with their work in the Airport.  Then  to\r\n\r\ntheir  surprise, they found that workers from another\r\n\r\ncontractor have come to take over the job. It appears\r\n\r\nthat  the first contractor has lost his contract.  He\r\n\r\nhas  still not paid his workers and he did  not  even\r\n\r\nhave  the courtesy to inform his workers that he  has\r\n\r\nlost  his  contract. Some contractors never  pay  the\r\n\r\nsalaries in full to their workers. What they do is to\r\n\r\npay  75%  of their salary and withhold the  rest.  Is\r\n\r\nthis  permissible?  What is being  done  about  these\r\n\r\nunreliable  contractors  and  also  contractors   who\r\n\r\nexploit  foreign  labour by not contributing  CPF  or\r\n\r\npaying  the  right  amount  of  contributions?   Many\r\n\r\nworkers  do not report these matters to the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLabour,  simply because some of the contractors  have\r\n\r\nsecret  society connections, and they  are  therefore\r\n\r\nafraid of repercussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we emphasise so much on productivity that we\r\n\r\nhave  forgotten  where productivity lies.  Sometimes,\r\n\r\nthe  wages  paid are such that they do not  encourage\r\n\r\nproductivity. I quote an example. The Airport  junior\r\n\r\nstaff and the daily rated workers have to work in the\r\n\r\nrain  and  sun  under very difficult conditions.  Yet\r\n\r\ntheir  wages  are  far  below  that  of  workers   in\r\n\r\nfactories  who work in air-conditioned comfort.  What\r\n\r\nincentive  is  there  for the productivity  of  these\r\n\r\nworkers? I think most probably the Member for  Changi\r\n\r\nunderstands  this  matter and he will  know  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in the Airport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I crave your\r\n\r\nindulgence.

There are\r\n\r\nreasons  for this. Generally, such work is contracted\r\n\r\nout  to  contractors.  There are  chief  contractors,\r\n\r\ncontractors and sub-contractors. The workers  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  any safeguards over their employment.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot enjoy paid holidays or double pay for working  on\r\n\r\nrest  days. They do not enjoy paid sick leave, annual\r\n\r\nleave,  or maternity leave under the Employment  Act.\r\n\r\nAll  these unreasonable and unjust working conditions\r\n\r\nare found among workers on building sites and also in\r\n\r\nplaces  where  the  contract system  is  done.  These\r\n\r\nworkers do not enjoy all these benefits. The only way\r\n\r\nto do away with this anomaly is to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norganise  the  workers  under  contract  labour   and\r\n\r\nunionise them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as the contractor comes to know that the\r\n\r\nworkers  have  joined the union, he will  immediately\r\n\r\ndissolve his company and sack all of them. This means\r\n\r\nthat  as  soon  as the workers under contract  labour\r\n\r\nunionise so as to protect their interests, they  will\r\n\r\nlose  their jobs. Some private companies also  resort\r\n\r\nto  the  same tactics as the contractors  by  sacking\r\n\r\ntheir   workers  and  hand  over  the  job   to   the\r\n\r\ncontractor.  This happens very often  in  the  recent\r\n\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the Labour Ministry find out from the Registry\r\n\r\nof  Companies  how many HDB worksites  and  buildings\r\n\r\nhave  been  used  by  contractors  to  put  up  their\r\n\r\noffices.  So I hope the Minister realizes the  plight\r\n\r\nof  these workers and take necessary action to  amend\r\n\r\nor   enact  the  relevant  Act  so  that  workers  of\r\n\r\ncontractor  can enjoy all those benefits provided  by\r\n\r\nthe  law. The principal company should be responsible\r\n\r\nin awarding such benefits similar to what is provided\r\n\r\nin  the  Workmen's  Compensation Act.  The  principal\r\n\r\ncompany should also be responsible for the workers to\r\n\r\njoin a trade union for their interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of medical facilities provided\r\n\r\nfor  the  workers, according to the present Act,  any\r\n\r\nsick leave could only be allowed on the production of\r\n\r\na medical certificate issued by the company doctor or\r\n\r\nin  the  absence  of  such doctor,  by  a  Government\r\n\r\ndoctor.   When   the   Singapore  Industrial   Labour\r\n\r\nOrganisation   complained  about  its   members   not\r\n\r\nreceiving  good  medical care because of  restriction\r\n\r\nunder  the  terms  of  their contracts,  the  company\r\n\r\ndoctors  immediately protested. According  to  recent\r\n\r\nnewspaper  reports, some doctors have confirmed  such\r\n\r\nrestrictive   regulations  in  respect   of   medical\r\n\r\ncharges.  In  view  of  the  restriction  on  medical\r\n\r\ncharges,  nobody believes that company doctors  would\r\n\r\nbe  so  generous  as  to give expensive  medicine  to\r\n\r\nemployees  of  a company because they know  that  the\r\n\r\nemployer  will  refuse to pay such expensive  medical\r\n\r\ncosts. Therefore, we can come to only one conclusion,\r\n\r\ni.e, under these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances, employees will not be  able  to  enjoy\r\n\r\nadequate  and fair medical care. Worse still,  if  an\r\n\r\nemployee is not satisfied with the diagnosis  by  the\r\n\r\ncompany doctor, he is not allowed to see a Government\r\n\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers also understand that Government doctors\r\n\r\nare  neutral. From the point of professional  ethics,\r\n\r\nwhen  there  is a difference of opinion  between  two\r\n\r\ndoctors, one  should not challenge the other.  There\r\n\r\nare  a  few  local organisations who neglected  these\r\n\r\nmedical  ethics.  Instead,  they  instigated  certain\r\n\r\ncompanies   not   to  recognise  the   diagnosis   by\r\n\r\nGovernment  doctors. Because of these differences  of\r\n\r\nopinion, the life of the patient is at stake. A widow\r\n\r\nonce told me that if her husband had not paid heed to\r\n\r\nhis employer's threat to sack him if he were to visit\r\n\r\nthe  Government doctor during working hours, he might\r\n\r\nstill be alive today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the seriousness of this matter, I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Labour will pay attention to it and\r\n\r\nproperly amend the Employment Act so that the workers\r\n\r\nwill  be  entitled to sick leave on certification  by\r\n\r\nthe   company   doctor   or  a   Government   doctor.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,  if  there  is  a  difference  in  the\r\n\r\ndiagnosis of these two doctors, then the diagnosis of\r\n\r\nthe Government doctor should be upheld because he  is\r\n\r\nmore  neutral  and there is no conflict  of  personal\r\n\r\ninterest involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the existing law, it is an offence for\r\n\r\na  trade  union to claim for anything  in  excess  of\r\n\r\nfrozen  quantum  but  the law does  not  make  it  an\r\n\r\noffence  for an employer to pay less than the  frozen\r\n\r\nquantum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees are accustomed to expect a certain quantum\r\n\r\nof  Annual Wage Supplement on a fixed date, under the\r\n\r\nterms of Collective Agreement. At the 11th hour, many\r\n\r\ncompanies  do  not  pay  the frozen  quantum  on  the\r\n\r\npretext  that they have no capacity to pay. Would  it\r\n\r\nnot  be  fair  for  such companies to  apply  to  the\r\n\r\nArbitration Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 984</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor variation of Collective Agreement or apply to the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Labour to reduce the quantum  well  in\r\n\r\nadvance  so that the employees will not be  taken  by\r\n\r\nsurprise if they do not receive the quantum of Annual\r\n\r\nWage  Supplement  that they are entitled?  This  will\r\n\r\nalso  not give the workers cause to suspect any  foul\r\n\r\nplay, otherwise it will appear unfair to them.  If  a\r\n\r\ncompany  wants  to continue to pay  the  annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement  more  than the frozen quantum,  it  would\r\n\r\nhave to get the approval of the Minister for Finance.\r\n\r\nIt  is  now  up to the company to decide  whether  to\r\n\r\napply or not. It is an offence for the union to  even\r\n\r\nenquire  whether  the  company  wishes  to  make  the\r\n\r\napplication. Similarly, when approvals are given, the\r\n\r\nunions   are  not  informed.  Consequently,   several\r\n\r\ncompanies make their own announcements when they make\r\n\r\nthe application and when approvals are received. This\r\n\r\ndefinitely is unfair to the unions because they  have\r\n\r\nto  hear  about  the  additional  payments  from  the\r\n\r\nemployers and in many instances after the payment  is\r\n\r\nmade, Such practice makes the union members feel that\r\n\r\nthe  company is the benefactor and more generous  and\r\n\r\nthat  the union is in a helpless position and useless\r\n\r\nto  them. When a company which has paid more than the\r\n\r\nfrozen quantum refuses to apply for approval for  the\r\n\r\ncontinuation  of  the payment of additional  quantum,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister should direct the company to apply  for\r\n\r\napproval  and let the Ministry of Finance  to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether the company has the capacity to pay or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour is very keen in according\r\n\r\nequal  treatment to all the employees. When the trade\r\n\r\nunion  has  got  better  conditions  of  service   or\r\n\r\nremunerations for its members, the Ministry will  see\r\n\r\nto  it  that the non-unionised workers will  also  be\r\n\r\naccorded equal treatment. Once the unionised  workers\r\n\r\nget  certain benefits from the employer, the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Labour would quickly see the employer and urge the\r\n\r\nemployer to accord to the non-unionised workers equal\r\n\r\nbenefit.  On  the  contrary, when a trade  union  has\r\n\r\nconcrete evidence to show that a certain employer has\r\n\r\nbeen  giving non-unionised workers higher annual wage\r\n\r\nsupplement, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Labour officials would  say  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  not  help the unionised workers to  get  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  because they were not given the  power  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  such  an  employer  to  give  such  equal\r\n\r\nbenefits  to  them.  If this is so,  why  should  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Labour  intervene  when   the   union\r\n\r\nnegotiates and comes to an agreement for better terms\r\n\r\nto its members?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the term \"non bargainable\r\n\r\nemployees\" used by the Member for Boon Teck  normally\r\n\r\nrefers  to  managerial  executives  and  confidential\r\n\r\nstaff.  The  Employment Act does  not  cover  persons\r\n\r\nemployed  in  a managerial, executive or confidential\r\n\r\nposition.  The  provisions in the Act  governing  the\r\n\r\npayment  of  annual bonus and annual wage  supplement\r\n\r\nare,  therefore, not applicable to them. Besides  the\r\n\r\nNational  Wages Council has decided, as a  matter  of\r\n\r\nprinciple, that its wage increase guidelines are  not\r\n\r\nintended  to  cover  these  categories  of  employees\r\n\r\nexcept those who are subject to collective agreement.\r\n\r\nThey are excluded because their salary structure  and\r\n\r\npromotion prospects and system of rewards are  worked\r\n\r\nout  competitively and applied individually according\r\n\r\nto performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in certain small establishments due\r\n\r\nto  the  nature  of the business or  profession,  the\r\n\r\nmajority   of   the  staff  are  in  the  managerial,\r\n\r\nexecutive or confidential categories. The common ones\r\n\r\nare  the  consultancy firms where  the  engineers  or\r\n\r\nprofessional   executives  outnumber   the   clerical\r\n\r\nemployees. But this situation is not present  in  the\r\n\r\nindustrial sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the exclusion of the managerial\r\n\r\nand  executive staff from the ambit of the Employment\r\n\r\nAct  and  the  NWC  wage  increase  guidelines  would\r\n\r\nencourage  employers  to upgrade certain  subordinate\r\n\r\nemployees to the non bargainable categories with  the\r\n\r\naim   of   discriminating  against  the   bargainable\r\n\r\nemployees.  Economic  reasons would  be  a  deterrent\r\n\r\nagainst exploitation of the situation, Besides, there\r\n\r\nare  provisions in the Industrial Relations  Act  for\r\n\r\ntrade    unions    to   challenge   the    unilateral\r\n\r\nclassification of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnon  bargainable employees by the employers  and  for\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial  Arbitration Court to  rule  on  such\r\n\r\ndispute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has long been an established practice for\r\n\r\nGovernment where the exigencies of the service permit\r\n\r\nto  allow the employees to take a half-day off on the\r\n\r\neve   of  festivals,  such  as  the  New  Year,  This\r\n\r\narrangement   is   subject  to  the  condition   that\r\n\r\ndepartments  having  business  with  members  of  the\r\n\r\npublic have to keep their normal working hours and no\r\n\r\nadditional   expenditure  should   be   incurred   on\r\n\r\novertime,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-festival time-off with pay is quite prevalent in\r\n\r\nthe  trade and services sectors. It could be regarded\r\n\r\nas an existing fringe benefit in establishments where\r\n\r\nsuch  an  arrangement has been in practice  for  some\r\n\r\nyears.  The  Member for Boon Teck is  well  aware  of\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy that there should be a freeze  on\r\n\r\nthe range and quantum of existing fringe benefits and\r\n\r\nthat  the  bizarre  ones  or  those  which  are   not\r\n\r\nconducive   to   our   economic  growth   should   be\r\n\r\ndiscontinued. Therefore, there is nothing to  prevent\r\n\r\nfirms  from continuing to observe pre-festival  time-off  with pay if such an arrangement is an accustomed\r\n\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has referred to a case of\r\n\r\nretrenchment by a certain company in 1975 and in 1976\r\n\r\nwhile  at  the same time showing profits.  Mr  Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I do not know the particular  company\r\n\r\nconcerned  nor  do  I know the reasons  for  the  two\r\n\r\nretrenchments carried out by this company. But it  is\r\n\r\npossible that the retrenchment could be the result of\r\n\r\nover-staffing   or   better   management   and    the\r\n\r\nintroduction   of  labour-saving  techniques,   hence\r\n\r\nresulting in redundancy. If this is the case, then it\r\n\r\nmakes  economic sense to retrench the redundant staff\r\n\r\nso as to make its products more competitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Singapore has to face intense\r\n\r\ncompetition  for markets abroad. To do so,  it  means\r\n\r\nthat   a   company  has  to  constantly   raise   its\r\n\r\nproductivity  and  this may involve  either  improved\r\n\r\ntechniques  of  production, the introduction  of  new\r\n\r\nmachinery, and sometimes reduction of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 987</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlabour forces as a result. This is probably the  only\r\n\r\nway  for  the  company, or in the wider  context  the\r\n\r\ncountry,  to  survive and prosper in  this  intensely\r\n\r\ncompetitive world. The workers so retrenched  can  be\r\n\r\nredeployed in other productive activities and in  the\r\n\r\ntight  labour  market like Singapore they  will  soon\r\n\r\nfind alternative employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nhas called for an amendment to the Employment Act  on\r\n\r\nthe provisions covering sick leave.

The Employment Act  at  present\r\n\r\nprovides  for  an  employee  to  consult  first   the\r\n\r\ncompany's  medical practitioner. If no  such  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner  has  been appointed, the  employee  can\r\n\r\nconsult  the  Government  medical  officer.  When   a\r\n\r\ncompany  has  appointed  a  duly  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner  or has set up a medical  clinic  within\r\n\r\nthe  factory  premises, it is  only  right  that  any\r\n\r\nemployee  falling  sick  should  first  consult   the\r\n\r\ncompany's  doctor. There are many  reasons  why  this\r\n\r\nshould  be  so.  Firstly, the  company's  doctor  can\r\n\r\nattend to the employee immediately should there be an\r\n\r\nurgent  need  for  medical  attention.  Besides, the\r\n\r\ncompany's  doctor would have the medical  history  of\r\n\r\nthe   employee  and  can  make  proper  and   correct\r\n\r\ndiagnosis.  Secondly, by providing immediate  medical\r\n\r\nservices  productivity  is maintained  by  curtailing\r\n\r\nunforeseen  disruption  of work  due  to  illness  of\r\n\r\nemployees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Paya Lebar\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Labour adopts a flexible  stand\r\n\r\nand   has   advised  companies  to   accept   medical\r\n\r\ncertificates  issued by Government  medical  officers\r\n\r\neven  when companies have their own appointed medical\r\n\r\npractitioner. Furthermore, hon. Members would like to\r\n\r\nknow that it is the prevailing practice in collective\r\n\r\nagreements  to recognise medical certificates  issued\r\n\r\nby  the company or Government medical officers or  in\r\n\r\nthe case of a bona fide emergency by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 988</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nany   registered   medical   practitioner.   In   the\r\n\r\ncircumstances,  it  is  unnecessary  to   amend   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act relating to sick leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has raised the issue of job-hopping and cautioned against condemning workers who\r\n\r\nchange  jobs for valid reasons, like adverse  working\r\n\r\nconditions, distance from work, etc. The latter point\r\n\r\nis well taken. However, of equal consideration is the\r\n\r\nneed  for  our  workers to imbibe higher  skills  and\r\n\r\ncompetence and thus increase productivity. It is only\r\n\r\nthrough  increased  productivity that  Singapore  can\r\n\r\ncompete  effectively in the international market.  If\r\n\r\njob-hopping  especially among the younger  generation\r\n\r\naffects overall productivity, then this habit has  to\r\n\r\nbe  stopped. Most cases of frivolous job-hopping  are\r\n\r\ndue  to lack of dedication and personal pride in  job\r\n\r\naccomplished.  This is compounded by  the  impatience\r\n\r\nfor higher monetary rewards and rapid promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already informed the House earlier during the\r\n\r\ndebate  on the President's Address that to discourage\r\n\r\njob-hopping  for frivolous reasons, the NWC  will  be\r\n\r\nasked  to  consider whether such employees should  be\r\n\r\ndeprived    of   the   full   NWC   wage    increase.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding  this, all employers should  exercise\r\n\r\ngreater  initiative to inculcate and  motivate  their\r\n\r\nwork  force  towards  greater harmony  and  increased\r\n\r\noutput.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members for Anson and Paya Lebar have\r\n\r\nraised  the  subject of unscrupulous contractors  and\r\n\r\npoor  working conditions in the building construction\r\n\r\nindustry. We are all aware of the tight labour market\r\n\r\nin  this  sector.  That being  so, it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nfeasible  for  a  contractor to  unduly  exploit  his\r\n\r\nworkers  without  risk  of  losing  them  to  another\r\n\r\ncontractor. It is true that some workers due  to  the\r\n\r\ncasual  nature  of  their jobs may  not  be  enjoying\r\n\r\nbenefits  like  annual leave,  rest  day.  CPF, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  is  sometimes done  with  the  mutual\r\n\r\nconsent  of both parties. The Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nAct, for   instance,  lays  down   explicitly   the\r\n\r\nliabilities of the employer and employee. Workers can\r\n\r\nalways lodge a complaint to the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 989</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCPF  Board  in cases of non-CPF payments  where  such\r\n\r\npayment is due.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the examples cited of some contractors\r\n\r\nwithholding salaries, the Employment Act provides for\r\n\r\nthe  payment  of salaries before the  expiry  of  the\r\n\r\nseventh  day after the last day of the salary period.\r\n\r\nFailure to do so is an offence under this Act. Again.\r\n\r\nworkers can seek redress through the Labour Ministry.\r\n\r\nCases of non-adherence to paid holidays, annual leave\r\n\r\nand  paid  sick  leave can also be  referred  to  the\r\n\r\nLabour Ministry for appropriate action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has referred to job\r\n\r\nopportunities   for  ex-convicts.   Sir,   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments and statutory boards have in recent years\r\n\r\nadopted  a  more liberal and enlightened policy  with\r\n\r\nregard  to the employment of ex-convicts in order  to\r\n\r\nassist them in integrating into society. In order  to\r\n\r\nenhance  the  employment prospects  of  prisoners  on\r\n\r\ntheir  release, the Government has set up a statutory\r\n\r\nboard,  the  Singapore Corporation of  Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nEnterprises, which  provides  specifically  for  the\r\n\r\nindustrial and vocational training of prisoners.  The\r\n\r\nobjective  of such a training programme is to  instil\r\n\r\nwork  discipline  in  the prisoners  as  well  as  to\r\n\r\npromote  their vocational skill. Prisoners are  being\r\n\r\ntrained  in  a  wide  variety  of  trades  for  their\r\n\r\neventual  employment in both the public  and  private\r\n\r\nsectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry's Employment Service also renders\r\n\r\nemployment   assistance  to  every  job  seeker   who\r\n\r\nregisters  with  the Service, irrespective  of  their\r\n\r\nbackground.    Introduction   of    registrants    to\r\n\r\nprospective   employers  for  employment   is   based\r\n\r\nstrictly  on their work suitability. In other  words,\r\n\r\nan  ex-convict seeking employment assistance from the\r\n\r\nService   is   given  the  same  treatment   in   job\r\n\r\nopportunities as the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has also mentioned that there\r\n\r\nwere some marriage applications between citizens  and\r\n\r\nwork  permit holders which were turned down, and that\r\n\r\nalthough  appeals  made by Members of  Parliament  on\r\n\r\ntheir   behalf   were  not  successful, subsequently\r\n\r\napprovals for their\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 990</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmarriage  were  granted. I wish to  assure  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson that there are no double  standards\r\n\r\nin  the  consideration of applications  for  marriage\r\n\r\nbetween  citizens and work permit holders. The  cases\r\n\r\nof   subsequent   approvals  are  those   where   the\r\n\r\napplicants  later meet with our policy  requirements,\r\n\r\nlike  the requirement of having to work for at  least\r\n\r\nfive  years, or being skilled after having been trade\r\n\r\ntested by the Industrial Training Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered most of the points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to have two points clarified by the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour. First, the company which I mentioned just now\r\n\r\nis  a  manufacturing company. It  is  not  a  service\r\n\r\ncompany  as the Minister has stated. I must say  that\r\n\r\nit is quite prevalent in a number of companies to try\r\n\r\nto  exclude  as many employees as possible  from  the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Act   and   pay   higher   annual   wage\r\n\r\nsupplements.  In  the  case of the  company  which  I\r\n\r\nmentioned,  how can we convince the workers  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot  go  beyond the annual wage supplement  limit?\r\n\r\nFor  every eight workers in this company, one  worker\r\n\r\ngets  four  months, whereas those  workers  who  come\r\n\r\nwithin  the  ambit  of  the Employment  Act  get  two\r\n\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to find out from the Minister\r\n\r\nis:  will he consider amending the Employment Act  or\r\n\r\nother  legislation to make sure that the annual  wage\r\n\r\nsupplement is applicable to everyone, irrespective of\r\n\r\nwhether   they  are  in  the  bargainable   or   non-bargainable category. We are not certainly  objecting\r\n\r\nto  a  few top managerial personnel who deserve  more\r\n\r\nthan what the Employment Act permits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification is the question of\r\n\r\nhalf-day  off  for the workers, What I am  saying  is\r\n\r\nthis. If the Government which is the biggest employer\r\n\r\nsets the example of giving half day off on the eve of\r\n\r\nthe  four  festivals and also on New Year's Eve,  how\r\n\r\ncan  we encourage more and more workers to go to  the\r\n\r\nmanufacturing sector? I do not think that this is  an\r\n\r\narea where it can be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 991</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconsidered  bizarre. In the past,  the  employer  has\r\n\r\nbeen giving these benefits but because of the NWC  we\r\n\r\ntrade  unionists are prepared to accept the  freezing\r\n\r\nof  all fringe benefits and the employer conveniently\r\n\r\nalso tries to take away the half-day off benefit from\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nsaid  just  now, it does not make economic sense  for\r\n\r\nthe  company to upgrade bargainable employees to  the\r\n\r\ncategory  of non-bargainable employees and  pay  them\r\n\r\nhigher  annual wage supplement unless there are  good\r\n\r\nreasons  for doing so. In any case, there  are  these\r\n\r\nprovisions  in the Industrial Relations Act  for  the\r\n\r\nunions   to   challenge  the  company's   action   in\r\n\r\nunilaterally  reclassifying its  employees  from  the\r\n\r\ncategory of bargainable to the non-bargainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the half-day off for New Year\r\n\r\nfestivals, I have said that where it is an accustomed\r\n\r\nfringe  benefit then the workers should  continue  to\r\n\r\nenjoy the benefit. I think there are a good number of\r\n\r\nmanufacturing companies offering their employees more\r\n\r\nthan  just half a day off. In any case, I shall refer\r\n\r\nthe  point raised by the Member for Boon Teck to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Finance for his  consideration  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether the half-day off for civil servants should be\r\n\r\nabolished completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Phey Yew Kok:</b> Sir, I would definitely take up the\r\n\r\ncase  with  the  Ministry of  Labour  regarding  this\r\n\r\ncompany  and, if possible, with the NWC to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat there is no abuse. I thank the Minister for  his\r\n\r\nreply and I beg leave to withdraw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr Tan\r\n\r\nCheng San.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head N be\r\n\r\nreduced by $10 in respect of subhead AAA 1010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 992</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng San</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, as I have\r\n\r\nalready  touched upon this  item earlier,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nwish to speak on this amendment now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho See Beng, amendment (3)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Khe Bong):</b> Sir, I beg\r\n\r\nto move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*That the sum to be allocated for Head N be reduced\r\n\r\nby $10 in respect of subhead ACA 1101. (* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs.\r\n\r\nTeong Eng Siong, P. Govindaswamy, Ho Kah Leong and Ch'ng Jit Koon).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the matter I would like to raise before this\r\n\r\nHouse,  which  comes  under  the  portfolio  of   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour, concerns the case of a  marriage\r\n\r\nbetween  a  Singaporean and a Malaysian. This  couple\r\n\r\napplies  to  the  Commissioner  for  Employment   for\r\n\r\napproval  to  marry  in 1 973.  The  application  was\r\n\r\napproved  on the condition that they should  sign  an\r\n\r\nundertaking to undergo sterilisation after having two\r\n\r\nchildren.  This  couple  signed  the  undertaking  to\r\n\r\nobtain  the  Commissioner's approval, and  they  were\r\n\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trouble begins after the arrival of their second\r\n\r\nchild,   as   they  are  now  required   to   undergo\r\n\r\nsterilisation. The woman was willing but the man  was\r\n\r\nnot.  He  argued that it would suffice  if  his  wife\r\n\r\nalone  was  sterilised. He said  that  even  if  they\r\n\r\ncontinued  to  cohabit as man and wife, they  cannot\r\n\r\nproduce  any  more  children.  But  the  Commissioner\r\n\r\ninsisted  that  both the husband and  the  wife  must\r\n\r\nundergo  sterilisation, and warned the  husband  that\r\n\r\nhis  wife  would  be expelled from  Singapore  if  he\r\n\r\nfailed  to  comply. The man did not  go  despite  the\r\n\r\nwarning. This resulted in the wife being sent back to\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The woman now lives in Malaysia while  the\r\n\r\ntwo  children  live with their father  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThus  this  once  happy  family  is  now  broken   up\r\n\r\nvirtually  by  the injustice of a man-made  decision.\r\n\r\nWhy  must the Commissioner insist on both the husband\r\n\r\nand  wife  to undergo sterilisation? So long  as  the\r\n\r\nwife is sterilised and medically proved incapable  of\r\n\r\ngiving  birth  to  any  more children, is  this  not\r\n\r\nenough?  What  is  the  necessity  to  sterilise  the\r\n\r\nhusband also? To\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 993</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nadd  insult  to  injury. I was told that  this  woman\r\n\r\nconcerned   was   sent  back  to  Malaysia   by   the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Department  on the  instruction  of  the\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Employment. Since then she has  been\r\n\r\nprohibited from entering Singapore to visit  her  two\r\n\r\nchildren  and  her  husband because  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment refused to endorse her passport  when  she\r\n\r\napplied  for  the  usual two-week temporary  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I think this is wrong and unjust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously urge the Labour Minister to put a stop\r\n\r\nto this kind of restriction, like requiring people to\r\n\r\nundergo   sterilisation   before   approving    their\r\n\r\nmarriage.  The Commissioner's duty is  to  accept  or\r\n\r\nreject  according to the merits of the case.  If  the\r\n\r\napplication  merits consideration, then  he  approves\r\n\r\nit,  otherwise  he  rejects it.  Trading  a  marriage\r\n\r\napproval  for sterilisation should not be allowed  to\r\n\r\nbe practised in future. If we believe in achieving  a\r\n\r\nmore just and equal society, moral duty requires  the\r\n\r\nLabour  Minister to act and restore the happiness  of\r\n\r\nthis family concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, under this\r\n\r\namendment,  I  want  to raise two  matters,  Firstly,\r\n\r\naccording to complaints, it takes a very long time to\r\n\r\nget  work permits, sometimes stretching to more  than\r\n\r\none   month,  This  is  very  inconvenient  to  those\r\n\r\nfactories which are in urgent need for workers.  Some\r\n\r\ngarment  factories which have large  orders  have  to\r\n\r\nrecruit many female workers, but it is very difficult\r\n\r\nto  recruit  them locally. Therefore,  they  have  to\r\n\r\nrecruit from abroad. They approached the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  for  work permits, but it takes a  very  long\r\n\r\ntime.  This is very inconvenient for these  factories\r\n\r\nas  it retards production. Therefore, I suggest  that\r\n\r\nthe Minister concerned should ease the restriction on\r\n\r\nissue of work permits to facilitate manufacturers  to\r\n\r\nfulfil their orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter is a request to ease the\r\n\r\nrestriction  or  to  liberalise  the  issue  of  work\r\n\r\npermits   to   drivers,  barbers  and  general   shop\r\n\r\nassistants, I have often received complaints from the\r\n\r\npublic  concerning  the difficulty  in  getting  work\r\n\r\npermits for these people. The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 994</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmajority  of  their applications have been  rejected,\r\n\r\ncausing  much  inconvenience  to  many  people.   For\r\n\r\nexample, the  Secretary of the Citizens Consultative\r\n\r\nCommittee  in  my  constituency is  the  owner  of  a\r\n\r\nbookshop.  He  wanted to employ a  driver  from  West\r\n\r\nMalaysia  at a monthly salary of $280. He applied  to\r\n\r\nthe authority in charge for a work permit, but it was\r\n\r\nrejected.  I  also appealed to the authority  on  his\r\n\r\nbehalf,  giving my reason that it was very difficult,\r\n\r\nin  fact impossible, to get drivers locally.  But  it\r\n\r\nwas  also  rejected.  There are  many  other  similar\r\n\r\ncases. Therefore, I hope the Minister concerned  will\r\n\r\nliberalise  the  conditions for  the  issue  of  work\r\n\r\npermits. This problem has existed for many years.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past,  restriction on work permits  for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  was  meant  to reserve jobs  for  our  local\r\n\r\npeople.  At  present, our employment  situation  has\r\n\r\nimproved, and  also  there is a  shortage  of  local\r\n\r\ndrivers, barbers, grocers and coffee shop assistants.\r\n\r\nSince  this is the case it is time that the  Minister\r\n\r\nconcerned  reappraised the situation and  review  the\r\n\r\npolicy  of  work  permits.  If  these  over-stringent\r\n\r\nmeasures    were   continued, it   would    greatly\r\n\r\ninconvenience   the   small   businessmen   adversely\r\n\r\naffecting  their  business.  Therefore.  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinister concerned will take immediate steps to  ease\r\n\r\nthe   restrictions  on  work  permits  to  solve  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, work permits are no doubt\r\n\r\nsupposed to be issued only to legitimate cases. But I\r\n\r\nfeel   that  common  sense  should  prevail  in  some\r\n\r\ndeserving  cases.  We have a bad labour  shortage  in\r\n\r\ncertain  occupations, construction workers being  one\r\n\r\nof  them.  We have no alternative whatsoever  but  to\r\n\r\nemploy foreigners. Therefore, I suggest that the Work\r\n\r\nPermits  Office  should be more liberal  in  granting\r\n\r\nwork permits for these workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, there is a shortage of workers in\r\n\r\ndomestic labour such as cooks, servants, etc. Let  me\r\n\r\ndeal  with the question of servants. Quite often work\r\n\r\npermits  are not issued to those who want to work  as\r\n\r\ndomestic  servants. But let me put the  problem  this\r\n\r\nway. If we do not get domestic servants, then our own\r\n\r\nwomen who are highly educated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 995</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand employed have no choice but to resign and stay at\r\n\r\nhome  to  look  after  their  children.  Servants  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are  in great demand. They have  become  a\r\n\r\nvery  expensive and precious category  of  labour.  A\r\n\r\nnumber of highly educated women are unable to work in\r\n\r\nthe  civil service, because they are unable to employ\r\n\r\ndomestic servants. Their resignation is a great  loss\r\n\r\nto the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will use his good offices to\r\n\r\nrectify  the problem and deal with it in an  amicable\r\n\r\nway.

The Member  also\r\n\r\nadded   that   the  wife's  agreement   to   go   for\r\n\r\nsterilisation should suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member will recall that with effect from July,\r\n\r\n1973, prior approval is necessary if the work permit\r\n\r\nholder wants to marry a Singapore citizen. Such prior\r\n\r\napproval  is  given if the work permit  holder  is  a\r\n\r\nskilled  worker.  If  the work permit  holder  is  an\r\n\r\nunskilled worker, approval is given if he has  worked\r\n\r\nfor at least five years on work permit. In both cases\r\n\r\nno  sterilisation  bond is required.  A  work  permit\r\n\r\nholder who contravenes the marriage policy will  have\r\n\r\nhis  work  permit cancelled. The citizen  party  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  subjected to disincentives. He or she  will\r\n\r\nnot be eligible to apply for HDB flats nor will their\r\n\r\nchildren   enjoy  free  education  or  their   family\r\n\r\nsubsidised medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offer of the sterilisation bond is made in\r\n\r\ncertain circumstances, like where the couple does not\r\n\r\nqualify for marriage approval but the female party is\r\n\r\nin the family way. It is a humane way out for couples\r\n\r\nin  such  a situation. The concept of a sterilisation\r\n\r\nbond is in keeping with the family planning ideal of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 996</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na   two-child   family.   The   acceptance   of   the\r\n\r\nsterilisation bond is strictly voluntary. The  couple\r\n\r\nis  given medical counselling on sterilisation  after\r\n\r\nwhich it is up to the couple to accept or reject  the\r\n\r\nbond.  On  signing the bond the couple  will  undergo\r\n\r\nsexual  sterilisation only after  the  birth  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  child. It is only fair that both  parties  be\r\n\r\nrequested to undergo sterilisation. This is  in  line\r\n\r\nwith our objective of a two-child family. If only one\r\n\r\nparty  is  required to be sterilised.  I  would  have\r\n\r\nthought that the husband rather than the wife  should\r\n\r\nbe  the  one.  I  must  stress  the  point  that  the\r\n\r\nsterilisation bond is undertaken voluntarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not unreasonable in such circumstances where\r\n\r\ncouples have been granted early marriage approval for\r\n\r\nthe couple concerned to honour their undertaking. The\r\n\r\nundertaking  can,  of  course, be  withdrawn  by  the\r\n\r\ncouples  but then they must be prepared to  face  the\r\n\r\nconsequence of disincentives being applied on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon.

Let me\r\n\r\nassure him that the Work Permits Office does not take\r\n\r\na   month  or  more  to  process  and  decide  on  an\r\n\r\nindividual work permit application. The time taken is\r\n\r\nusually  about a week or so from the date of  receipt\r\n\r\nof a work permit application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an approved application, he must\r\n\r\nremember  that  the  non-resident applicant  will  be\r\n\r\nasked  by  letter  to undergo a medical  examination,\r\n\r\nincluding X-ray and blood test at the medical  centre\r\n\r\nin  the Work Permits Office, and at the same time the\r\n\r\napplicant  is informed that temporary permission  for\r\n\r\none  month  is granted to him to start work.  So  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang will appreciate that given  the\r\n\r\nthorough nature of the medical examination, it  will\r\n\r\ntake  about  two weeks for the result of the  medical\r\n\r\nexamination to be conveyed to the Work Permits Office\r\n\r\nby  the  medical authority. On the date of the expiry\r\n\r\nof  the  one month temporary permission, he  will  be\r\n\r\nissued  a  work  permit  if  he  has  been  certified\r\n\r\nmedically fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some cases which require\r\n\r\nverification or clarification of certain  information\r\n\r\nwhich  either  has not been given  or  has  not  been\r\n\r\nclearly  stated  by  applicants in  the  work  permit\r\n\r\napplication  form. Because of this they are  required\r\n\r\nto  appear  for  an interview. From experience, more\r\n\r\noften  than  not, they do not turn up  punctually  or\r\n\r\nsometimes  they do not respond at all. For this  type\r\n\r\nof  cases it would therefore take a much longer  time\r\n\r\nto  process.  The  present system of processing  work\r\n\r\npermit applications is satisfactory. Nevertheless, we\r\n\r\nare  constantly on the look-out to cut  out  any  red\r\n\r\ntape found unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his second point, I can see the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang is very persistent indeed. This is the\r\n\r\nthird  consecutive year that he has  brought  up  the\r\n\r\nsubject  of giving work permits to certain  types  of\r\n\r\napplicants. I do not think I can give a better  reply\r\n\r\nthan that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 998</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven by my Minister on the last two occasions and  I\r\n\r\nwould  invite him to read the reply given as recorded\r\n\r\nin the Hansard of the last two Budget sittings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Singapore's continued policy of rapid\r\n\r\nindustrialisation it is of vital importance that  the\r\n\r\nmanpower requirements of the industries should  first\r\n\r\nbe  met. In line with this policy we have to continue\r\n\r\nto  accord priority in applications for work  permits\r\n\r\nfrom non-citizens seeking employment in factories and\r\n\r\nother   industrial  undertakings.  So  long  as   our\r\n\r\neconomic  objectives and manpower  strategies  remain\r\n\r\nunchanged, non-citizens wishing to pursue  soft  jobs\r\n\r\nand relatively unproductive jobs like shop assistants\r\n\r\ncould not be given priority at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that this year he has chosen to add drivers\r\n\r\nto  the list of such occupations as barbers and  shop\r\n\r\nassistants  which have been brought up in  the  past.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the post of drivers they can be filled\r\n\r\nby  Singaporeans. So the employers will probably have\r\n\r\nto  pay a bit more. Last month alone. 47 applications\r\n\r\nwere approved. In fact, there are about 3,500 drivers\r\n\r\non  work  permits at this moment. So each application\r\n\r\nis considered on its own merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of barbers, we have not been unduly\r\n\r\nrestrictive  in granting work permits to non-citizens\r\n\r\nengaged  in  this  particular  occupation.  This   is\r\n\r\nbecause  the  Ministry is aware that few Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  interested in taking up such employment. For the\r\n\r\npast year, 45 out of 85 male applicants to be barbers\r\n\r\nas  against  133 out of 282 female applicants  to  be\r\n\r\nbarbers were approved. The majority of those rejected\r\n\r\nwere found to be job-hopping, while a minority failed\r\n\r\nto   pass   the  skill  evaluation  test  as  barbers\r\n\r\nconducted  by the Adult Education Board.  So  in  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, the Ministry will not relax the policy\r\n\r\npertaining to barbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Anson brought up the question of\r\n\r\ncertain  types  of jobs which are very  difficult  to\r\n\r\nfill  by citizens because they are not available,  We\r\n\r\nare  aware  that some professionally qualified  women\r\n\r\nhave  been  unable to take up employment  or  gainful\r\n\r\nemployment and had to give up jobs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 999</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  difficulty  in  obtaining  domestic\r\n\r\nservants.  The  Ministry has,  in  fact,  been  quite\r\n\r\nliberal  in  the  issue of work permits  to  domestic\r\n\r\nservants. As at the end of February 1977, there  were\r\n\r\n3,732   non-citizens  on  work  permits  working   as\r\n\r\ndomestic servants and last year. 1,702 work  permits\r\n\r\nwere   issued  to  non-citizens  to  work   in   such\r\n\r\nemployment.  Householders who intend to  employ  non-citizens  as domestic servants have little difficulty\r\n\r\nin  obtaining  work permits if both the  husband  and\r\n\r\nwife are in gainful employment or if the husband  can\r\n\r\nsatisfy the Commissioner for Employment that his wife\r\n\r\nwould  take up employment within a reasonable  period\r\n\r\nof  time  upon being granted approval to employ  non-citizen domestic servant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the employment of cooks who are non-citizens,\r\n\r\ntheir applications are favourably considered if  they\r\n\r\npossess  relevant experience, while applications  for\r\n\r\nwork permits from young and inexperienced workers are\r\n\r\nrejected. As at the end of last month, there were 867\r\n\r\nnon-citizens  on work permits working as  cooks, and\r\n\r\nlast year, there were 371 work permits issued to non-citizens to work in such employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do not\r\n\r\nbelieve  the  Minister of State is talking  from  his\r\n\r\nheart  because I know he is a very religious  man.  I\r\n\r\nthink  it  is  not  difficult for me  to  refute  his\r\n\r\nargument.   In   the  first  place,  he   said   that\r\n\r\nsterilisation  is  required of  this  couple  not  by\r\n\r\npressure or force. That I quite understand. But there\r\n\r\nis  a  subtle pressure behind that. If a couple  just\r\n\r\nmarries without the approval of the Commissioner  for\r\n\r\nEmployment the consequence is obvious, the woman will\r\n\r\nbe  sent back to Malaysia. I am not quarrelling about\r\n\r\nthe objective which is to reduce our rapid population\r\n\r\ngrowth and that is why we have to bring in all  kinds\r\n\r\nof  measures to achieve this objective. But what I am\r\n\r\nquarrelling about is that the Commissioner should not\r\n\r\nbring  in this condition to induce a couple to  agree\r\n\r\nto sterilisation which will later on bring about this\r\n\r\ntragedy and trauma.

But\r\n\r\nin future I say that this exercise should be removed.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you will create more cases  like  what  I\r\n\r\nhave referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to supplement what the Minister of\r\n\r\nState for Labour has said regarding marriages between\r\n\r\ncitizens and non-resident work permit holders and  at\r\n\r\nthe same time indirectly answer the point made by the\r\n\r\nMember for Khe Bong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when a citizen marries a non-resident work\r\n\r\npermit    holder   without   prior   approval,    the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy is to cancel the work  permit  of\r\n\r\nthe  holder and at the same time ask him  or  her  to\r\n\r\nleave  the  State, as is what happened  in  the  case\r\n\r\ncited by the Member for Khe Bong. Several MPs at that\r\n\r\ntime  appealed to me on behalf of those  affected  on\r\n\r\ncompassionate  or  humanitarian grounds  because,  by\r\n\r\nasking the work permit holder to leave the State,  it\r\n\r\nmeans the break-up of the family and worse still,  if\r\n\r\nthe  couple concerned has already had children or are\r\n\r\nexpecting  a  child  on  the  way.  The  anxiety  and\r\n\r\nhardship  suffered  are even greater  in  the  latter\r\n\r\ncase. It was in response to these appeals by some MPs\r\n\r\nand   also   numerous  appeals  from  those   couples\r\n\r\nconcerned   that  a  decision  was  made   to   offer\r\n\r\nsterilisation as the humane way out. This  in  a  way\r\n\r\nwill  meet  the  national  interest  of  keeping  the\r\n\r\npopulation increase under control so as not to  over-stretch  our  social, medical and education  services\r\n\r\nwhile   at  the  same  time  the  marriage   can   be\r\n\r\nregularised and the family unit can be kept intact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasise again that acceptance of\r\n\r\nsterilisation is strictly voluntary and the operation\r\n\r\nis  only  carried out after the birth of  the  second\r\n\r\nchild.  Sterilisation  as a way  out  of  the  couple\r\n\r\ninvolved  is only offered after repeated  appeals  by\r\n\r\nthe  parties concerned and with great reluctance.  It\r\n\r\nwould have been better if the work permit holder  can\r\n\r\nwait until he or she has worked for five years before\r\n\r\nentering  into matrimony or if he or she can  acquire\r\n\r\nthe necessary skills to qualify for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1001</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermanent  residence and thereby approval  for  early\r\n\r\nmarriages without having to undergo sterilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I fail to see how the offer of\r\n\r\nsterilisation  which will only be carried  out  after\r\n\r\nthe  birth  of the second child can be inhumane  when\r\n\r\nour  own citizens are being asked to stop at two.  It\r\n\r\nwould  appear  that a kind and humane act  to  assist\r\n\r\ncouples,  who,  either  through  folly  or  force  of\r\n\r\ncircumstances, have to get married early is not being\r\n\r\nappreciated. If the Member for Khe Bong is reflecting\r\n\r\nthe  general  feelings of the great majority  of  the\r\n\r\npeople concerned, the Members of this House included,\r\n\r\nand  not just the selfish interest of the husband  he\r\n\r\nis  championing,  then  I am prepared  to  reconsider\r\n\r\nwhether   the  offer  of  sterilisation   should   be\r\n\r\nwithdrawn,  in which case, I must point out  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  mean loss of job to the work permit holder  and\r\n\r\nthe separation of husband and wife and children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Member for Khe Bong, on behalf of the\r\n\r\ncouple  that he is championing, has asked.  \"Why  not\r\n\r\njust  sterilise  the woman instead of requiring  both\r\n\r\nparties  to  undergo  sterilisation  operation.\"  The\r\n\r\nanswer,  I  think,  is quite obvious.  To  be  really\r\n\r\neffective   in   controlling   population   increase,\r\n\r\nespecially when both parties are young and in view of\r\n\r\nthe  high  divorce rate, there is nothing to  prevent\r\n\r\nthe divorcee to marry again and raise another family.\r\n\r\nI  am  surprised that the Member for Khe Bong  should\r\n\r\nadvocate  sterilisation for the woman only.  I  would\r\n\r\nhave  imagined that it should be the man  for,  quite\r\n\r\napart  from  a simpler and easier operation,  in  our\r\n\r\nAsian  society  it is invariably the  man  who  keeps\r\n\r\nmistresses   and  maintains  more  than  one   family\r\n\r\nestablishment. In the specific case that  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Khe Bong has mentioned. I do not see why the man\r\n\r\nshould refuse to go for sterilisation if he genuinely\r\n\r\nloves  his  wife and his two children and  wants  his\r\n\r\nwife to join him and to look after the two children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\njust said - (In English) Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1002</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> According to the Standing Orders, if a\r\n\r\nMember  commences to speak in one language, he should\r\n\r\ncontinue to speak in that language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I have said just now that the Minister has been\r\n\r\n\"fathoming  a  gentleman's thought by  a  petty-man's\r\n\r\nmeasure.\"  Why  should he suspect  that  the  husband\r\n\r\nwould  keep mistresses?

The  situation  has\r\n\r\nchanged   and  our  employment  rate  now  is   high.\r\n\r\nTherefore, restrictions should be eased in  order  to\r\n\r\nallow  foreign  workers to work  here  in  commercial\r\n\r\nenterprises. This is my first point. The second point\r\n\r\nis  this. He just said that if we pay a higher salary\r\n\r\nto  our  local  citizens, then we would  be  able  to\r\n\r\nrecruit   them   to   fill   those   vacancies.   But\r\n\r\nGovernment's labour policy is to restrain from paying\r\n\r\nhigher wages in order to keep this State so as to  be\r\n\r\nin a competitive position to attract more investments\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad.  So a higher salary is incompatible  to\r\n\r\nour policy. Could the Minister of State explain?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I think he\r\n\r\nhas  missed my point about priority. If we have steel\r\n\r\nfactories  and  productive  establishments  requiring\r\n\r\nmanpower, and we have to go outside the  country  to\r\n\r\nget  the  workers, we must have these  places  filled\r\n\r\nfirst,   But  we  cannot  allow  people  from   other\r\n\r\ncountries  to come in and take up unproductive  jobs,\r\n\r\nwhen   there  are  so  many  vacancies  in  factories\r\n\r\nrequiring  to  be filled. Therefore, soft  jobs  and\r\n\r\nunproductive types of jobs cannot get priority. We do\r\n\r\nnot issue work permits for such kind of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said that we had to pay higher wages to local\r\n\r\npeople,  I  am  just stating a fact that  if  we  pay\r\n\r\nforeign workers less, and we just get hold of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers to come into Singapore, then what is going to\r\n\r\nhappen to our workers? We still need to have jobs for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1004</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nour people. Therefore, they must be paid. And as long\r\n\r\nas there are workers available, it is just a question\r\n\r\nof  having  to pay a bit more. There is no particular\r\n\r\nreason  why  we should bring in foreign workers  just\r\n\r\nfor that particular reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I seek\r\n\r\nclarification on a point? The Minister of  State  has\r\n\r\nmentioned  that work permit holders who  have  worked\r\n\r\nfor  five  years  need  not  undertake  the  bond  of\r\n\r\nsterilisation,  Now, at the moment, as  I  understand\r\n\r\nit, there is rigidity in the calculation of the five-year  period, i.e, the work permit holder  must  have\r\n\r\nserved  five  years  in  one  work-place.  Would  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State consider approving a work  permit\r\n\r\nholder who has worked for five years, irrespective of\r\n\r\nwhether or not he or she has worked in more than  one\r\n\r\nwork-place?  I  am  not encouraging job-hopping, but\r\n\r\nmerely to refer him to the plight of such work permit\r\n\r\nholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI think the Member for Serangoon Gardens did not have\r\n\r\nhis  premise right. When we say \"five years\",  we  do\r\n\r\nnot  say that a work permit holder must work for five\r\n\r\nyears  in one establishment. In other words, he  can\r\n\r\nhave  more  than  one employer. But  when  this  job-hopping question arose, there is a minimum period  of two  years  - at the beginning it was three  years  - during  which a work permit holder must work for  one\r\n\r\nemployer  before  he can leave. Therefore,  logically\r\n\r\none  person  cannot  be working  for  more  than  two\r\n\r\nemployers, or at the most three employers,  within  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of five years. As long as he can work  within\r\n\r\nthis period for two or three employers, well, he  has\r\n\r\ndone  his five years. We do not say that he must work\r\n\r\nfor five years with one employer. That is not the way\r\n\r\nthe period is calculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, just on a\r\n\r\npoint  of  clarification. Does the Minister of  State\r\n\r\nnot  realise that even with an increased  quantum  of\r\n\r\nwages for certain jobs, Singaporeans still shun  away\r\n\r\nfrom these jobs?

We do not say that we do  not\r\n\r\nissue  work permits at all. We do give work  permits,\r\n\r\nbut then each case would have to be considered on its\r\n\r\nown  merits.  We do not give a blanket  approval;  if\r\n\r\nsomebody wants to employ a driver, we give him a work\r\n\r\npermit.  No.  We have to consider whether  he  really\r\n\r\nneeds  a  driver and that it is absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nWe  do  give work permits. It is not that we  do  not\r\n\r\ngive them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, is it the policy not to give\r\n\r\nwork   permits   for  shop  assistants?

Such  manpower  is  required\r\n\r\nelsewhere.  If we were to issue a work  permit  to  a\r\n\r\nshop  assistant  so that he could bring  a  katty  of\r\n\r\nsugar  up  the  stairs to a buyer in a Housing  Board\r\n\r\nflat, my goodness, we will have to issue thousands of\r\n\r\nwork permits for shop assistants.
