The\r\n\r\ncrisis  we face is in part the result of forces that we  have\r\n\r\nno  control over.  These forces were responsible for our past\r\n\r\nsuccess.  They are responsible for our present recession; and\r\n\r\nif managed correctly, they will bring us future prosperity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first force is the force of the free market. In\r\n\r\nhistorical  terms,  the  force  of  the  free  market  is   a\r\n\r\nrelatively  new force.  When kings and queens controlled  all\r\n\r\nthe  factors  of production, there was no free market.   Only\r\n\r\nwhen  individuals  had  the right  to  private  ownership  of\r\n\r\nwealth, no matter how little or how much the wealth was,  did\r\n\r\nthe free market emerge as a force.  Industrialisation and the\r\n\r\ndivision of labour greatly amplified its power.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last century has shown us that the free market is\r\n\r\nthe   most  efficient  way  of  organising  the  factors   of\r\n\r\nproduction and producing wealth.  The collapse of the  Soviet\r\n\r\nUnion  is  proof of the inefficiency of centrally  controlled\r\n\r\neconomies.  The recent rapid prosperity of China is proof  of\r\n\r\nthe  effectiveness  of free market principles  in  generating\r\n\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When people of a common culture are divided by an\r\n\r\naccident  of  history,  and one half follows  a  free  market\r\n\r\neconomy  and  the other half a centrally controlled  economy,\r\n\r\nthe  free  market economy has always performed better.   West\r\n\r\nGermany was more prosperous than East Germany and South Korea\r\n\r\nis more prosperous than North Korea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore by embracing the free market system and by\r\n\r\nhaving one of the most open economies in the world has become\r\n\r\nan  affluent nation.  However, the free market system is also\r\n\r\nresponsible for our current recession.  We can react in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  ways.   The  first approach is to try and ringfence  our\r\n\r\neconomy and preserve the status quo.  Our economy will remain\r\n\r\npreserved,  frozen  in  time, but the  world  will  move  on.\r\n\r\nTwenty years from now, foreigners will find us quaint.   Just\r\n\r\nas we often remark when we are in less developed countries  - this  is how Singapore used to be in the 60s - they will  say\r\n\r\nthis is how their country used to be in the 90s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or we take the second approach and look at the recession\r\n\r\nas  an opportunity to allow the free market to reorganise our\r\n\r\neconomy  so that we will be more efficient and will  enter  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  growth in the 21st century.  We must  not  expect\r\n\r\nthat  when we come out of this recession, things will be like\r\n\r\nthey  used  to  be in the mid-90s.  Our economy will  change.\r\n\r\nLike the mature economies of the world, there will be a shift\r\n\r\nfrom a manufacturing-based economy to a more service-oriented\r\n\r\neconomy.   Like  the  mature  economies,  our  dependence  on\r\n\r\nconstruction must decrease.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the 1980s, I lived in the United\r\n\r\nStates  for  five  years in the State of  Michigan,  about  a\r\n\r\nminute's drive from the World Headquarters of General  Motors\r\n\r\nand  about  15 minutes' drive from the World Headquarters  of\r\n\r\nFord  Motors.  The output of these two companies  is  greater\r\n\r\nthan  the  GDP  of  Singapore.  The 1980s were  a  period  of\r\n\r\nanguish  for  many Americans.  The Japanese economy  appeared\r\n\r\nstrong  and many contemplated a future where Japan  would  be\r\n\r\nthe premier country of the world.  A Japanese corporation had\r\n\r\npurchased  that  icon  of New York - the Rockefeller  Center.\r\n\r\nMany   thought  the  American  auto  industry  would  perish.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  protecting  the auto industry,  the  US  allowed\r\n\r\nmarket forces to restructure the industry.  The auto industry\r\n\r\nwas  forced to make better cars more efficiently and  by  the\r\n\r\n1990s, the American auto industry was again the strongest  in\r\n\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is the Japanese auto industry that is in\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Nissan required a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nforeigner  to  restructure  and save  the  company.   Japan's\r\n\r\nreluctance  to allow restructuring of its economy  after  its\r\n\r\nbubble  economy  burst has hindered its  recovery.   We  must\r\n\r\navoid the mistakes that Japan has made.  To recover from this\r\n\r\nrecession, we must further deregulate and allow market forces\r\n\r\nto make us more efficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor that we have no control over is\r\n\r\nglobalisation.  The search for profits has made globalisation\r\n\r\na  powerful  force.  It was the desire of Europeans  to  make\r\n\r\nhuge  profits from the spice trade that drove them to explore\r\n\r\nthe  world,  discover America and circumnavigate  the  world.\r\n\r\nSince  then, the world has become inter-linked and we  cannot\r\n\r\nescape globalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the fate of the African living in his village\r\n\r\nin  the  17th  century.  European taste for sugar  fuelled  a\r\n\r\ntriangular  trade whereby trinkets from Europe were  sold  in\r\n\r\nAfrica  for African slaves who were then transported  to  the\r\n\r\nCaribbean to be worked to death to grow sugar, which would be\r\n\r\nsold  in  Europe for huge profits.  Whether globalisation  is\r\n\r\nmorally  good or bad is for philosophers to decide, but  like\r\n\r\nthe   African   in  the  17th  century,  we   cannot   escape\r\n\r\nglobalisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is new, however, is the degree to which the\r\n\r\npolitical and economic fates of countries are becoming inter-linked   and   the  speed  at  which  globalisation   affects\r\n\r\ncountries.   Just  imagine, Osama sitting in  his  office  in\r\n\r\nAfghanistan reviewing the videos of Yishun MRT and the  World\r\n\r\nTrade Center in New York.  Because he chose to strike in  New\r\n\r\nYork,  we  were spared death and destruction.   On  September\r\n\r\n11th,  I  was  watching CNN.  The first  plane  had  hit  the\r\n\r\ntowers.  The instant I saw the second plane hit the building,\r\n\r\nI  knew it was a terrorist attack.  So did millions of others\r\n\r\nacross the world who viewed CNN.  This is the speed at  which\r\n\r\ninformation moves across the globe today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Enron collapsed, dragging Arthur Andersen into the\r\n\r\ncontroversy,  within  days, our honest Singapore  accountants\r\n\r\nworking under the Arthur Andersen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\numbrella had to consider merging with other firms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation brought the electronics industry to\r\n\r\nSingapore  because  it was efficient to locate  the  industry\r\n\r\nhere.   Globalisation is taking many of  these  factories  to\r\n\r\nChina  and  elsewhere  because it is  more  efficient  to  be\r\n\r\nlocated there.  We cannot fight globalisation.  What  we  can\r\n\r\ndo  is to find a new niche in the global market where we  are\r\n\r\nefficient and where we have an edge in competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third force is the progress in the application of\r\n\r\nscience.   Discoveries in science by themselves may  have  no\r\n\r\nimpact.   But  when  they are applied, they  can  change  the\r\n\r\ncourse of history.  The Chinese discovered gunpowder but  the\r\n\r\napplication  of gunpowder to cannons by the Ottomans  brought\r\n\r\nthe  collapse  of Constantinople and changed  world  history.\r\n\r\nAlthough the transistor was invented in the United States, it\r\n\r\nwas  Sony  and  other Japanese companies that  were  able  to\r\n\r\nexploit   its   applications  and  have  dominated   consumer\r\n\r\nelectronics ever since.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two decades have seen a revolution in applied\r\n\r\nscience  due  to  the mass introduction of computers  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace  and  in  the home.  We must  be  thankful  to  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board for seeing the potential  in  the\r\n\r\ncomputer  industry  and  bringing the  computer  industry  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But as the computer industry plateaus, we need to\r\n\r\nlook  for  a  new niche where advances in the application  of\r\n\r\nscience will fuel growth.  The life sciences is an area  that\r\n\r\nSingapore should consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Government cannot control the three forces\r\n\r\nI  described,  the  Government must play an  active  role  to\r\n\r\ncomplement  and  manage  these  forces  for  the  benefit  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I  believe  there  are  three  areas  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment has a major role.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first area is with regard to the civil service and\r\n\r\nthe statutory boards.  Our civil servants and statutory board\r\n\r\nemployees  are men and women of integrity working  diligently\r\n\r\nin the service of the nation.  But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  institutions are shielded from the forces of the  free\r\n\r\nmarket.   Yet,  they  too must restructure  and  become  more\r\n\r\nefficient or they may gradually become what Bertrand  Russell\r\n\r\ncalled  \"a  collection of officials, different for  different\r\n\r\npurposes, drawing comfortable incomes\", happy \"so long as the\r\n\r\nstatus quo is preserved.\"  It is Parliament's duty, those  on\r\n\r\nthe  Frontbench and those on the Backbench, who  must  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the civil service and statutory boards remain efficient\r\n\r\nand give the people the maximum at the minimum cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where the Government must act is to\r\n\r\nreduce  the  real  difficulties faced by our  citizens  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of the recession and restructuring.  We must  do  our\r\n\r\nbest to help people through this period.  However, we must be\r\n\r\ncareful  not to create a welfare state and avoid  creating  a\r\n\r\ndependency  culture  in  our citizens.   We  should  consider\r\n\r\nAbraham   Lincoln's   advice:  \"In  all   that   people   can\r\n\r\nindividually do as well for themselves, government ought  not\r\n\r\nto interfere.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area where the Government should act is to see\r\n\r\nhow we can utilise the economics of QWERTY, spelt Capital  Q,\r\n\r\nW, E, R, T, Y, to help us.  If you look at your keyboard, the\r\n\r\nkeys at the upper left corner are Q, W, E, R, T, Y.  When the\r\n\r\ntypewriter  was first invented, the machine would  often  jam\r\n\r\nwhen  the  operator  typed too fast.   So  the  keyboard  was\r\n\r\ndesigned  to be as inefficient as possible.  Today  keyboards\r\n\r\ndo  not  jam, but we continue to use the same format for  the\r\n\r\nkeyboard,  even  though it is inefficient.   Economists  like\r\n\r\nPaul  David  call this, the law of positive  returns  or  the\r\n\r\neconomics of QWERTY after the keyboard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see examples of QWERTY all around. The IT\r\n\r\nindustry began in the Silicon Valley through the foresight of\r\n\r\nStanford University.  Today, all those interested in  the  IT\r\n\r\nindustry  still  continue to converge to the Silicon  Valley,\r\n\r\neven  though  it is one of the most expensive places  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited States.  Likewise, the entertainment industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngravitates  to Hollywood.  Even Chinese films like  Crouching\r\n\r\nTiger,  Hidden  Dragon and Indian films like Lagaan  look  to\r\n\r\nHollywood for approval at the Oscars as this translates  into\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars in the global film market.  Patients from\r\n\r\naround  the  world travel to a small town in  the  middle  of\r\n\r\nwheat  fields  in Minnesota to see the doctors  of  the  Mayo\r\n\r\nClinic.   These  are examples of QWERTY where an  established\r\n\r\npractice gives a place a competitive advantage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a month ago, I was introduced to a former Indian\r\n\r\nMinister  who  is  now a top lawyer.  He  came  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause an Indian company had a dispute with an Indian  State\r\n\r\ngovernment.  The arbitration was being conducted in Singapore\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  becoming  an established  practice  in  many\r\n\r\ncontracts  in  India to choose Singapore as  a  location  for\r\n\r\narbitration for disputes.  I was greatly encouraged by this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a brand name. If we can create a pattern\r\n\r\nwhere people within seven hours flying time come to Singapore\r\n\r\nfor  services in education, health, insurance, banking,  law,\r\n\r\nresearch,   entertainment,  the  arts,  shopping  and   other\r\n\r\nservices,  these patterns will self-perpetuate and get  fully\r\n\r\nestablished.   Then, even if we are a high cost  centre,  the\r\n\r\neconomics of QWERTY will work in our favour because  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  competitive  edge as established  patterns  tend  to\r\n\r\npersist.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are at the crossroads. The people\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  are pragmatic.  They know there  are  no  easy\r\n\r\nsolutions to difficult problems.  They do not pine for a lost\r\n\r\npast  that  will  not come back.  We, Singaporeans,  are  the\r\n\r\nchildren of tough and hardy immigrants.  Survival is  in  our\r\n\r\ngenes.   If we, people and Parliament, see the future not  as\r\n\r\none  full  of  problems  but as one  full  of  opportunities,\r\n\r\nopportunities for us to seize for our benefit,  we  can  make\r\n\r\nSingapore one of the greatest cities of the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President in his Address highlighted that as we\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  economy  we must maintain  and  strengthen  our\r\n\r\nsocial   cohesion.   Our  income  distribution   is   already\r\n\r\nstretched  out.   At  the  lower end of  our  society,  those\r\n\r\nwithout skills have difficulty raising their incomes or  even\r\n\r\nfinding jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the tasks of the Economic Review Committee is to\r\n\r\nlook  at how to lower business costs.  I think we pay greater\r\n\r\nattention  to  business  costs  because  businessmen  are   a\r\n\r\npowerful group and they power the economy.  I would urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to go further and see whether the overall costs of\r\n\r\ngoods  and  services can be relooked in Singapore.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge the Government to set up a committee to see  how\r\n\r\ncost of living in Singapore can be reduced further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I meet and interact with many residents in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  In my meetings with my constituents, it is  clear\r\n\r\nthat they are concerned with managing their lives on a day-to-day basis.  For many low income families, the daily challenge\r\n\r\nis  not only about the cost of living, but actually the  cost\r\n\r\nof  survival  in  Singapore.  Many are struggling  to  upkeep\r\n\r\nthemselves and their families.  I am confident that there are\r\n\r\nmany  areas in the provision of Government goods and services\r\n\r\nwhere we can further lower our charges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many areas of expenditure where we can\r\n\r\nundertake a detailed audit of what is the real cost and  what\r\n\r\nis  being charged by the various Government departments.  For\r\n\r\nexample,  I  was  pleasantly surprised when the  Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies  launched a new fees structure for registration  of\r\n\r\nnew  companies  from a minimum of $1,200  to  $300  recently.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for a business registration, it has come down from\r\n\r\n$55  per  year to $105 for three years.  I am sure there  are\r\n\r\nmany  other Government departments where there can be greater\r\n\r\ntransparency  on  what is the real cost  and  what  is  being\r\n\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, many statutory bodies must become more\r\n\r\ntransparent on what they charge and what is their true  cost.\r\n\r\nCan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  key  goods  and service  providers,  like  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health, Ministry of Home Affairs,  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nTrade  and  Industry, including the Ministry of  Information,\r\n\r\nCommunications and the Arts, become more transparent on their\r\n\r\ncosts  and  charges so that we can better understand  whether\r\n\r\nthe  Government  departments are recovering cost  or  whether\r\n\r\nthey  are  profiteering marginally or grossly?  This  becomes\r\n\r\neven  more necessary when the goods or services are  provided\r\n\r\nby  a monopoly.  In fact, Sir, I take on and support the call\r\n\r\nby   the  Minister  of  State  who  spoke  earlier  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  provide  services  and  goods  for  maximum\r\n\r\nbenefit  at  minimum  cost.  But  somehow  that  is  not  the\r\n\r\nimpression among many members of the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that many statutory boards and Government\r\n\r\nautonomous  bodies can adopt such accounting  disclosures  so\r\n\r\nthat the true cost and revenue picture is well understood  by\r\n\r\nthe public.  It will certainly help to restrain some of these\r\n\r\norganisations and moderate what they charge the public.  I am\r\n\r\nconvinced  that some departments charge what the  public  can\r\n\r\npay  rather  than what is cost recovery or even a  reasonable\r\n\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently, IRAS sounded out getting charitable\r\n\r\norganisations  to  disclose  their  income  and   expenditure\r\n\r\nstatement of charitable organisations.  It will also  require\r\n\r\ndisclosure  about the top three salaries of their  employees.\r\n\r\nI  am  very  sure that it is a positive move as  many  donors\r\n\r\nwould like to know how their donations are being used.  If we\r\n\r\ncan  start  setting  benchmarks on how public  donations  are\r\n\r\nbeing used, I am sure that the Government can set even higher\r\n\r\nstandards on the cost and revenue for each service and  goods\r\n\r\nit provides to the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many who are keen to know how much does\r\n\r\nTraffic Police charge for a police report as against the true\r\n\r\ncost of providing such a service.  Some want to know how much\r\n\r\nis  the cost of medicine to our hospitals as against what the\r\n\r\nparticular hospital charges the public.  I am confident  that\r\n\r\nsuch public\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscrutiny  about  our Government and quasi-Government  bodies'\r\n\r\nincome and expenditure will encourage them to be sensitive as\r\n\r\nto  how they can charge the public.  I am concerned as  I  am\r\n\r\nconvinced that there are several Government departments  that\r\n\r\nmay  be profiteering in the provision of some public services\r\n\r\nas against working on a cost recovery basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would similarly like to urge the NTUC, as the key\r\n\r\nprovider  of  many  services  to  the  public,  to  similarly\r\n\r\ndisclose  to the public where it is possible on what  is  the\r\n\r\ncost  of their services and goods they provide to the  public\r\n\r\nand  their  union members.  NTUC FairPrice, for example,  can\r\n\r\ndisclose to the public on how much they subsidise the  public\r\n\r\nby  disclosing  the purchasing and operating  costs  and  the\r\n\r\nselling  price.  Perhaps, such public disclosure would  allow\r\n\r\nthe  public to better appreciate the subsidy or profit  being\r\n\r\nmade by our Government department or NTUC in the provision of\r\n\r\ngoods and services.  I am confident that this is also an area\r\n\r\nwhere  CASE can play a useful role in looking into the  areas\r\n\r\nhighlighted  and  work towards reducing the prices  of  these\r\n\r\ngoods and services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my hope is that the Government will not only lower\r\n\r\ncosts  for  businesses but also for all  Singaporeans.   This\r\n\r\nwill   certainly   go   a  long  way  in   helping   ordinary\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to my second topic on relations with\r\n\r\nour  neighbours.   Sir, the President has  spoken  succinctly\r\n\r\nwhen he stated that our own region has fundamentally altered.\r\n\r\nOur two immediate neighbours are facing different challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is still on the course of finding stability in\r\n\r\nmany  areas.  We have seen the change of three Presidents  in\r\n\r\nthree years and the emergence of hitherto hidden but powerful\r\n\r\nforces.  Their foreign and economic policies will be strongly\r\n\r\ndictated by a myriad of political parties and leaders and the\r\n\r\nneed  to  soothe an increasingly stronger Muslim  electorate.\r\n\r\nCompounding the problem is the emergence of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmedia  as  a  new  power in Indonesia.  The  media  is  still\r\n\r\ngroping  on  the  markers between absolute  free  speech  and\r\n\r\nresponsible  journalism.  Important issues are commented  and\r\n\r\ndebated according to the political flavour of the day and the\r\n\r\npolitical affiliations of the media.  Fortunately,  our  ties\r\n\r\nare deep and our friendship network is extensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy that we have helped and continue to help\r\n\r\nIndonesia recover economically.  The participation of GIC  in\r\n\r\nthe  purchase of assets by IBRA, the government-to-government\r\n\r\nloan  assistance package, and recently the idea of  including\r\n\r\nBintan as an export corridor to the USA under the proposed US-Singapore FTA are laudable.  The actions will help show  that\r\n\r\nSingapore is indeed a friend in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must continue to remain engaged in a big way in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.   It is a big and very large neighbour.   Although\r\n\r\nsome  Singaporeans  have turned negative about  investing  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia,  we  must  never take our sights  from  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSir,  regional autonomy offers tremendous business and  other\r\n\r\nopportunities  to Singapore businessmen.  I  have  spoken  to\r\n\r\nmany Indonesians and many have highlighted of new investments\r\n\r\nfrom  Europe, Japan and China into the provinces.  I  am  not\r\n\r\nhearing much of substantial private Singapore investments  in\r\n\r\nthe  provinces.   I do hope that the Ministry  of  Trade  and\r\n\r\nIndustry  will  study  ways  to  help  Singapore  businessmen\r\n\r\nexplore  and invest in Indonesia.  My fear is that when  real\r\n\r\neconomic recovery returns to Indonesia, Singaporeans  may  be\r\n\r\ntoo  late to join the bandwagon.  Let us not ignore  our  own\r\n\r\nbackyard  where we have a distinct advantage and  concentrate\r\n\r\non faraway markets where the competition may be greater.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Malaysia, it is the same old story. The\r\n\r\nseason  for  Singapore bashing used to be spread out  over  a\r\n\r\nlonger period of time.  Recently, the time gap appears to  be\r\n\r\nnarrowing.  The several by-elections there could be a factor.\r\n\r\nWell,  the bad news is that analysts are predicting an  early\r\n\r\ngeneral  election  next  year.  The  media  in  Malaysia  has\r\n\r\ndutifully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndone  its  part in portraying Singapore as the bad  boy  down\r\n\r\nsouth.   Much as we ignore the Malaysian media, we must  also\r\n\r\nunderstand that there is a whole new generation of Malaysians\r\n\r\nwho  get a regular dosage of anti-Singapore articles and news\r\n\r\nreports.   Many  have  come to believe  that  many  of  these\r\n\r\narticles and reports are true.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest issue on the land reclamation is a case\r\n\r\nin  point.  What started out as a comment by someone has  now\r\n\r\nsnowballed  as  a serious issue for them.  Interestingly,  no\r\n\r\nreport  has  been  disclosed by the state  of  Johor  or  the\r\n\r\nFederal  government on what exactly is the damage done.   The\r\n\r\nnewspaper  reports  faithfully the comments  by  politicians,\r\n\r\nbusinessmen, academics, bureaucrats and even fishermen on the\r\n\r\neffects of reclamation in Singapore.  What is clear from  the\r\n\r\npress reports is that there is as yet no comprehensive report\r\n\r\non the matter.  The various reports are still being waited by\r\n\r\nthe central government.  Sir, their own government has stated\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  waiting for the reports  to  come  from  the\r\n\r\nvarious authorities.  It may become embarrassing if later  it\r\n\r\ntranspires  that  (a)  the  reclamation  does  not   infringe\r\n\r\nMalaysian  territory (which we already  know)  and  (b)  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  substantial damage to  Malaysia  in  any  way.\r\n\r\nHaving  taken a stance that the reclamation is damaging  even\r\n\r\nbefore  the official reports have come in, clearly shows  the\r\n\r\nmentality  of our Malaysian neighbours - \"Shoot  first  -  we\r\n\r\nwill   find  a  reason  later\".   Fortunately,  neither   our\r\n\r\nGovernment  nor  Singaporeans are  rattled  by  this  present\r\n\r\nrhetoric or past rhetoric.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is puzzling to me is what are the intellects in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  thinking?   Are they wondering  why  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\ngovernment has not done a proper study on the matter earlier?\r\n\r\nWere  their government leaders, politicians, bureaucrats  and\r\n\r\ndiplomats so inept and inefficient that they were unaware  of\r\n\r\nthese  reclamation works?  Mind you, these reclamation  works\r\n\r\nare   well  publicised  in  advance.   In  some  cases,   the\r\n\r\nreclamation project has been completed some years ago, eg, at\r\n\r\nTuas.  What then is the latest agenda of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaysians?  To tell us what we should do and not  do  within\r\n\r\nour  territory?   To  rally their ground for  their  domestic\r\n\r\npolitics?   I really do not know and it may not be worth  our\r\n\r\ntime pondering over it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more puzzling is the new style of diplomacy that\r\n\r\nis  emerging  in  Malaysia.  Whenever there  is  a  bilateral\r\n\r\nissue,  the  position  there is to  use  the  media.   It  is\r\n\r\nelementary  diplomatic  convention  that  relations   between\r\n\r\nstates are conducted through diplomatic channels.  There  are\r\n\r\nproper  and  a range of diplomatic tools to raise matters  of\r\n\r\nconcern  between nations.  While one can forgive  small  time\r\n\r\npoliticians, bureaucrats, journalists and businessmen for not\r\n\r\nunderstanding  the art and use of diplomacy,  it  puzzles  me\r\n\r\nthat  the lack of understanding reaches the upper echelon  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysian leadership.  Perhaps, we can offer  them  some\r\n\r\nscholarships  to undertake academic programmes  in  diplomacy\r\n\r\nand international law at some renowned universities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To compound the matter, the Malaysian press has been\r\n\r\nunhelpful in publishing the truth when explanations are given\r\n\r\non  why  the reclamation will not impact or affect  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  it gets no coverage at all.  I recall the  article\r\n\r\nput  out  by  the  Straits Times on 30th  March  which  reads\r\n\r\n\"Reclamation will not hit shipping lanes\".  It has yet to  be\r\n\r\nreprinted  or published in Malaysia.  In fact,  to  show  the\r\n\r\nattitude  of  the Malaysian press, let me just highlight  one\r\n\r\ncase.   The  New  Straits Times just last  week  deliberately\r\n\r\nomitted  a  crucial paragraph that refuted  the  \"underclass\"\r\n\r\nclaim  in  an article about Malays in Singapore.  Well,  that\r\n\r\ncertainly  helps us to know where the Malaysian media  stands\r\n\r\non matters concerning Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in fact, if you want a joke, I picked up one last\r\n\r\nweek.   Malaysia's Berita Harian ran a comment by an  unnamed\r\n\r\nretired  navy rear admiral that our reclamation had paralysed\r\n\r\na  Malaysian  navy centre in the Johor Straits.  The  article\r\n\r\nstated that the\r\n\r\nnarrow   gap   between   the  two   countries   would   cause\r\n\r\nsedimentation  over the next few decades.  This  would  allow\r\n\r\nSingapore's amphibious military vehicles\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  cross  into  Malaysia with ease.  When I first  read  the\r\n\r\narticle, I thought, \"What a brilliant planner we had  in  the\r\n\r\nSAF who was able to think decades ahead\" because they alleged\r\n\r\nthat  in  a few decades we will be able to cross the  straits\r\n\r\nthrough  this  process of sedimentation.  Then, I  reflected,\r\n\r\n\"But  are  they not making it easier for Malaysian amphibious\r\n\r\nvehicles to come to Singapore with ease?\", in which case, our\r\n\r\nreclamation will end up helping the Malaysian Armed Forces to\r\n\r\nfix Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this is a game of reverse psychology or even a\r\n\r\ncase  of  poor logic or poor argument.  I do not  know.   But\r\n\r\nwhat  one  can  think for sure is that this \"tak  ada  logic\"\r\n\r\nbarrage  from  across the Causeway will  continue.   What  is\r\n\r\nclear is that there are many voices emanating from across the\r\n\r\nCauseway.   By  the time it reaches us, it becomes  noise,  a\r\n\r\nnoise  we  have  gotten  used to  just  like  aircraft  noise\r\n\r\ngenerated from time to time over Singapore.  They are a pain,\r\n\r\nbut  we have got used to it.  Our destiny is here and we have\r\n\r\nto  do  business  here.  Let us continue to be  friendly  but\r\n\r\nfirm, respect each other and not denigrate each other, let us\r\n\r\ndiscuss but not be talked to or talked down.  Let us work for\r\n\r\nour mutual benefit and not for our mutual detriment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Government has been doing right in treating our\r\n\r\nMalaysian neighbour fairly but firmly.  We demand respect  as\r\n\r\na  sovereign  nation and we give them respect as a  sovereign\r\n\r\nnation.   We  encourage investments and tourism in  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWe  have  many  relatives and friends on both  sides  of  the\r\n\r\nborder.  We wish them well, for their prosperity augurs  well\r\n\r\nfor regional prosperity, as does ours for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a small nation. We have been\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in finding a place under the sun for our  people.\r\n\r\nWe  must  work as a team and look beyond these problems.   We\r\n\r\nshould  leapfrog  and  establish our economic  and  political\r\n\r\nlinks everywhere.  But we must remind ourselves that our home\r\n\r\nbase is here and we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearn  to live in this tough neighbourhood.  We have done  so\r\n\r\nas  a nation for the past 37 years.  I am confident that with\r\n\r\na  sound Government, united people and a strong SAF,  we  can\r\n\r\nmeet these challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support again the Motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  rise in support of the Motion moved by Mrs Lim  Hwee\r\n\r\nHua  in thanking the President for his Address at the Opening\r\n\r\nof this Tenth Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address focuses on our need to be\r\n\r\npragmatic  in the light of a dramatically changed  world  and\r\n\r\nthe   challenges   ahead  of  us.   We  are   indeed   facing\r\n\r\nunprecedented economic competition from all fronts, as we now\r\n\r\nemerge from last year's recession.  This is placing us in  an\r\n\r\nincreasingly  tight spot as our neighbours and  many  others,\r\n\r\nparticularly China, eye for the same economic pie.   We  must\r\n\r\nsharpen  our  pencils  to find new avenues  to  preserve  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  while also holding our social  cohesion,  or\r\n\r\nrisk   becoming  irrelevant  in  this  increasingly   harsher\r\n\r\nglobalised world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, as competition spurs on us, we must always\r\n\r\nbear in our subconscious that it is not a zero-sum game.   As\r\n\r\ncountries  in the region and beyond grow their economies  and\r\n\r\nraise   their  standard  of  living,  there  will   be   more\r\n\r\nopportunities created.  Some degree of interdependence on one\r\n\r\nanother  will create collaborative opportunities for  win-win\r\n\r\nsituations rather than being at loggerheads with each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our context, Sir, whether we collaborate or compete,\r\n\r\nat  the  core  of it is ensuring that our goods and  services\r\n\r\nprovide the best value to our customers at home and the  rest\r\n\r\nof  the  world.  We cannot, therefore, afford to rest on  our\r\n\r\nlaurels.   We must continue to strengthen our infrastructure,\r\n\r\ncontinually  upgrade the knowledge and skills of our  people,\r\n\r\nand take a critical review of Government policies to keep  us\r\n\r\neconomically competitive.  I am glad, Sir, that we  have  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review  Committee  and the  Remaking  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nCommittee in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace,  in  the light of many significant events  which  have\r\n\r\noccurred  in the recent past, to deliberate on the future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our people are our key assets, and it takes people to\r\n\r\nbring  about  the  difference  we  are  seeking  in  remaking\r\n\r\nSingapore,  I  would like, Mr Speaker, Sir,  to  address  two\r\n\r\npeople-related issues in our continuing effort to unleash the\r\n\r\nbest out of our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Sir, is the need to educate our people that the\r\n\r\nreal  challenges  before  us are  not  getting  out  of  this\r\n\r\nrecession per se, but to remake and re-engineer the Singapore\r\n\r\neconomy,  so that we remain competitive as a nation  and  are\r\n\r\nable to secure good growth in the next decade and beyond.  To\r\n\r\nface  the  uncertainty and the China challenge,  we  need  to\r\n\r\ncreate an environment in which individuals and firms are more\r\n\r\nwilling  to take risks and succeed on the strength  of  their\r\n\r\ncapabilities   and   efforts,  rather  than   dependence   on\r\n\r\nGovernment  subsidies and direction.  We must find  ways  and\r\n\r\nmeans  to  encourage individuals and our  SMEs  to  look  for\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  this  area  of  perpetual  motion  and  to\r\n\r\nexperiment  with  new  approaches in return  for,  hopefully,\r\n\r\nhigher rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know much of this is already being promoted by various\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies to evolve an enterprise-eco system.   In\r\n\r\naddition  to these agencies, Sir, I suggest that the  various\r\n\r\nchambers of commerce and industry, and even self-help groups,\r\n\r\nbe  also used as vehicles to help create greater awareness of\r\n\r\nthis  direction  we  need to take, not only  because  of  the\r\n\r\nchanging nature of employment contracts between employers and\r\n\r\nemployees   but   also  the  need  to   quickly   evolve   an\r\n\r\nentrepreneurial  culture so that a wider base  of  successful\r\n\r\nhome-grown, smart and innovative companies could  be  created\r\n\r\nto  help  propel  our  economy in the  longer  term.   It  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable that this will not be easy and will take  many\r\n\r\nyears  to  evolve,  but we must start somewhere,  and  sooner\r\n\r\nrather than later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The China threat has been quite often linked to this\r\n\r\nsubject.  Allow me, Sir, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshare  my  own  experience in doing  business  in  China.   I\r\n\r\nstarted  my  manufacturing operation in the  Singapore-Suzhou\r\n\r\nIndustrial Park, or now better known as SIP in short, in 1996\r\n\r\nas  a result of Mr Chan Soo Sen's strong persuasion then when\r\n\r\nhe  was  CEO  of SIP.  Since then, he and Mr David  Lim  have\r\n\r\nsubsequently  come  and  gone, and I  am  stuck  there.   The\r\n\r\n\"Suzhou  GRC\" has disappeared.  Sales of my company's product\r\n\r\nwere  initially  slow, but have more than quadrupled  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  two  years.  I studied the order pattern of my  Chinese\r\n\r\ncustomers  and discovered that much of these increased  sales\r\n\r\nare from four companies which did not even exist when I began\r\n\r\nin  1996.   The  owners are young professional  managers  who\r\n\r\nchose  to leave the comfort of their jobs in search of bigger\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Each of them is a qualified engineer and  has\r\n\r\nsmartly  used  consultants to draw up viable plans  and  used\r\n\r\ntheir  consultants' network to obtain capital  infusion  into\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  companies.  There  must  be  thousands  of\r\n\r\nsimilar  successful ventures out there which are quietly  but\r\n\r\nsurely contributing to China's GDP.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has done plenty to prepare us for\r\n\r\nthe  innovation and entrepreneurial age, but we  need  to  do\r\n\r\nmore  to  get  the  spirit  of  innovation,  enterprise   and\r\n\r\ntolerance  for risk-taking to sink into our people  and  help\r\n\r\nthis  to  take  off.   I  see this as an  opportune  time  to\r\n\r\nencourage  and  assist  many  mid-level  executives  who  are\r\n\r\ndisplaced  as  a result of the recession and, more  recently,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  banking  and  service sectors,  to  take  up  this\r\n\r\nchallenge.  Job matching programmes by CDCs and job  listings\r\n\r\nin  MOM's  Employment Town websites have  limitations.   Many\r\n\r\nexecutives still need help and have expressed frustration  in\r\n\r\nnot  being  able to find jobs.  As a further alternative,  we\r\n\r\nshould  reach  out  to this group as well as  promising  SMEs\r\n\r\nthrough the various Government assistance schemes, and assist\r\n\r\nthe   deserving  ones  to  become  entrepreneurs.    Wherever\r\n\r\napplicable, we should connect such individuals and firms with\r\n\r\ncredible  consultants who could help them package  meaningful\r\n\r\nbusiness plans and lead them to appropriate sources of funds.\r\n\r\nSuccessful entrepreneurs should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  more  regularly profiled in the media to spur  others  to\r\n\r\nfollow suit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now turn to my next subject matter\r\n\r\nwhich  concerns the importance of maintaining  strong  social\r\n\r\ncohesion and enhancing the spirit of caring and sharing.   We\r\n\r\nsurvived  in the initial years of independence and  prospered\r\n\r\nthrough the later decades because of the existence of such  a\r\n\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our younger generation today is growing up in\r\n\r\nthe  face  of  a  different set of challenges.   We  are  now\r\n\r\nfeeling  the pressures of living in a fundamentally uncertain\r\n\r\nworld.   We  have  to  make our living in this  unprecedented\r\n\r\nrapidly   changing  environment  that  may   even   be   more\r\n\r\nunpredictable than at any time since our independence in  the\r\n\r\n60s.   The  September 11th incident in the US and the  recent\r\n\r\narrest of the Jemaah Islamiyah radicalists are examples which\r\n\r\ncome  to mind, which have dramatically affected the lives  of\r\n\r\npeople  the  world over.  These are realities which  we  must\r\n\r\nface, whether we like it or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we struggle to get ourselves out of recession and re-engineer our economy, it is also essential that we continue\r\n\r\nwith  the  need  to  strengthen  our  racial  tolerance   and\r\n\r\nreligious  harmony in the light of the incidents I  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier.   The Government has shown sensitivity  to  this  as\r\n\r\nevidenced  by the timely call by the Prime Minister  for  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  Inter-Racial Confidence  Circles  or  IRCCs  to\r\n\r\nfoster  inter-racial and inter-religious  rapport  among  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   communities   by  having   them   interact   more\r\n\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the IRCCs, individuals, families and our\r\n\r\ngrassroots  organisations can also play an  active  role  and\r\n\r\nshould  not wait for Government initiatives to be  in  place.\r\n\r\nThey can organise activities to bring neighbours together  to\r\n\r\nget  to know each other better and to create mutual care  and\r\n\r\nshare  groups.  With many people still facing hardship  as  a\r\n\r\nresult  of  the recession, they can, for instance, work  with\r\n\r\nthe  CDCs  to  seek  out  people in difficulty  within  their\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  also  link  up  with  schools  to  extend  help  to  the\r\n\r\nunfortunate families and children.  Such acts will go a  long\r\n\r\nway in fostering harmony and in enlivening the spirit of care\r\n\r\nand  share,  and  will  readily  pave  the  way  for  greater\r\n\r\ntolerance for one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was recently invited to a temple function\r\n\r\nattended by more than 6,000 people.  In response to the  call\r\n\r\nfor   greater   understanding  of   our   diverse   religious\r\n\r\nbackgrounds,   the  temple  invited,  among  others,   mosque\r\n\r\ncommittee members from 12 different mosques in the east  and,\r\n\r\nbeyond  that,  also extended donations to  several  of  them.\r\n\r\nSuch  acts,  I  believe,  will go a  long  way  in  fostering\r\n\r\nunderstanding   among  our  multi-ethnic   communities.    In\r\n\r\ninteracting  with some of the mosque committee members  after\r\n\r\nthe  event,  several of them are already thinking  about  how\r\n\r\nthey could reciprocate in similar fashion to their non-Muslim\r\n\r\ncounterparts.   These are developments that we must  continue\r\n\r\nto  encourage  and nurture in our endeavour  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\nunderstanding between the various ethnic groups in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI call upon the Acting Minister for Community Development and\r\n\r\nSports  and the Minister in charge of Muslim Affairs  to  get\r\n\r\nhis Ministry to build upon and encourage such initiatives  as\r\n\r\nwe move forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the majority in the Muslim community are\r\n\r\naware  that the process of integration takes time and  effort\r\n\r\nto  build.   Behind the challenges, as a result of issues  on\r\n\r\nIslam  coming  to the fore, is this positive development  and\r\n\r\nearnestness among our various ethnic groups to want  to  know\r\n\r\nand  learn about each other's racial, religious and  cultural\r\n\r\npractices  better.  Being in a multi-racial society  requires\r\n\r\nevery  member of society to exhibit rationality and  adopt  a\r\n\r\ngive-and-take  attitude  in order to  foster  stronger  bonds\r\n\r\nbetween us.  While I am glad that the majority of Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  are rational and understand the bigger picture  of\r\n\r\nwhat  it  entails  in  living in a multi-racial  society,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also try to win over the radical few in the community\r\n\r\nto   understand  this  so  that  we  could  collectively,  as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nregardless of race and religious backgrounds, focus  on  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  issues of jobs and addressing our  competitiveness\r\n\r\nwhich  afflict  our  communities.  Again, the  MCDS,  through\r\n\r\nMUIS, MENDAKI and various community organisations could  help\r\n\r\nin propagating this message.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has been frank in\r\n\r\npresenting   us   with  a  potentially  more  difficult   and\r\n\r\nchallenging scenario ahead of us.  I believe Singaporeans are\r\n\r\na  pragmatic  lot and we have proven to be a  people  with  a\r\n\r\ncollective  will  to  succeed, and in doing  so,  have  shown\r\n\r\ncompassion  and  care  for  each other.   This  is  glaringly\r\n\r\ndemonstrated  when we sing Majulah Singapura collectively  at\r\n\r\nthe  National Stadium when we celebrate National Day  and  in\r\n\r\nthe recent General Elections when it comes to deciding who is\r\n\r\nbest to lead us for the future.  Although the future holds no\r\n\r\nguarantee of success, we Singaporeans are spurred on  by  the\r\n\r\nwords  \"Count  on  me,  Singapore\"  and  the  knowledge  that\r\n\r\ntogether we can achieve, and make Singapore the best home for\r\n\r\nour future generation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Motion of Thanks to the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President stressed on the need to\r\n\r\nmaintain and strengthen our social cohesion.  I see  this  as\r\n\r\nthe most pressing issue facing us today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to highlight four insidious divides\r\n\r\nthat threaten us from within.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the nationality divide, as Singapore\r\n\r\npursues  its  policy  of attracting international  talent  to\r\n\r\nsharpen  its  competitive edge in the global economy.   While\r\n\r\nthis  is  a  sound policy, some Singaporeans are increasingly\r\n\r\nconcerned that they would be treated as second class citizens\r\n\r\nin  their  own country.  Many continue to harbour  misgivings\r\n\r\nthat  employers are hiring foreigners for jobs that they  can\r\n\r\ndo just as well themselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is the age divide, as older Singaporeans\r\n\r\nfind   themselves  left  behind  by  the  new   economy   and\r\n\r\nincreasingly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndisconnected from the aspirations of the younger  generation.\r\n\r\nMany  older  workers  complain of age discrimination  in  the\r\n\r\nworkplace and in the job market.  And this is despite all the\r\n\r\nincentives  and  persuasion  by  the  Manpower  Ministry  for\r\n\r\nemployers to hire older workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the gender divide. Despite making up 54% of the\r\n\r\nworkforce today, women earn only about 78% of what their male\r\n\r\ncounterparts  earn.   There  are  still  pockets  of   sexual\r\n\r\ndiscrimination, such as unequal benefits for  equal  work  at\r\n\r\nthe  civil service.  While there have been advances for women\r\n\r\nin  some  areas,  they have not kept pace  with  the  massive\r\n\r\ninflux  of  women into the labour market.  As a  consequence,\r\n\r\nwomen run a much higher risk of being poorer than men.   They\r\n\r\nare also more vulnerable to retrenchments.  Census 2000 found\r\n\r\nthat  women  in  their late 30s and 40s had relatively  large\r\n\r\nincreases  in  unemployment  rate  compared  to  their   male\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  The women's unemployment rate rose from  about\r\n\r\n4%  in 1999 to above 6% in 2000.  The increase for their male\r\n\r\ncounterparts was lower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the ethnic divide. While all ethnic groups\r\n\r\nhave  enjoyed good income growth over the years,  the  Malays\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  lag behind the other races.  Still,  they  have\r\n\r\nmade tangible progress - more Malays are better-educated  and\r\n\r\nbetter-skilled  today, and more are taking  on  professional,\r\n\r\nmanagerial and executive jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since the September 11th terrorist attacks,\r\n\r\nthere  has been some concern among the Malay-Muslim community\r\n\r\nif  employers may now treat them differently because of their\r\n\r\nincreasing religiosity.  Their concern may well be unfounded,\r\n\r\nbut  still,  they persist.  We need to address these  divides\r\n\r\nand these genuine concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meritocracy is one of our founding principles, so is the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  equality of treatment and  non-discrimination.\r\n\r\nWe  must  make  it clear that discrimination based  on  race,\r\n\r\nreligion, gender, age or national origin is not tolerated  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  We must give each individual and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neach  group  the  confidence and hope that  they  have  equal\r\n\r\nopportunities to realise their aspirations, even  if  unequal\r\n\r\noutcomes are the result.  We cannot guarantee success, but we\r\n\r\nmust guarantee equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The progress may be uneven, each person or group\r\n\r\nsometimes  gaining,  sometimes  losing,  sometimes  climbing,\r\n\r\nsometimes  stumbling,  but always  treated  fairly  and  with\r\n\r\nrespect.   And above all, always given a fair hearing.   When\r\n\r\nthis  process  is  working, even those  who  have  the  least\r\n\r\nsuccess in realising their objectives will conclude that  the\r\n\r\nsystem itself is fair, just and legitimate.  In this respect,\r\n\r\nwe  need to examine if our social structures and institutions\r\n\r\nare adequate to ensure that our Constitutional principles  of\r\n\r\nnon-discrimination and equality are protected and promoted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a woman is discriminated at the workplace because she\r\n\r\nis  pregnant, where can she go to seek redress?  If a company\r\n\r\ndiscriminates  at the workplace in terms of  its  recruitment\r\n\r\nand  promotion  by race, nationality or age,  where  can  the\r\n\r\naggrieved  workers  go to seek a fair  hearing?   Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament,  unions  and the Manpower  Ministry  can  and  do\r\n\r\noccasionally take up such complaints.  But they  tend  to  be\r\n\r\npiecemeal,  ad hoc affairs.  And let us face it -  they  lack\r\n\r\nthe time and resources to investigate each case thoroughly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Act does give some protection to those\r\n\r\nwho have been sacked unfairly because of discrimination.  But\r\n\r\nits  effect is rather like a band-aid plastered over a  crack\r\n\r\non  the wall when gaps are opening up from beneath our  feet.\r\n\r\nThe  right  to  equal  treatment and the  principle  of  non-discrimination  are  entrenched  in  our  Constitution.   But\r\n\r\nSingapore  has yet to establish a body with teeth to  enforce\r\n\r\nthese  principles.  It prefers to use \"the persuasion,  moral\r\n\r\nsuasion  and  promotional way'' to nudge employers  down  the\r\n\r\npath.   I question if this is good enough, especially in this\r\n\r\nincreasingly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstressful environment.  If we do not give people a legitimate\r\n\r\navenue to seek redress, the gaps will become political traps.\r\n\r\nInstead of working positively to find solutions, people  will\r\n\r\npoliticize  the  issues and political opportunists,  both  at\r\n\r\nhome  and  abroad, will jump on the bandwagon  gladly.   This\r\n\r\nwill do greater harm to our social cohesion in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time that we considered setting up an agency such\r\n\r\nas the Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC), found in countries\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the United States, Britain, Hongkong and Australia.\r\n\r\nIt  enforces all the laws prohibiting discrimination based on\r\n\r\nrace, religion, gender or national origin in their countries.\r\n\r\nThe   laws   include  the  Equal  Pay  Act,   the   Pregnancy\r\n\r\nDiscrimination  Act,  as well as the Age  Discrimination  Act\r\n\r\nwhich protects individuals who are 40 years or older.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot have such provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recommending a version of the Equal Opportunity\r\n\r\nCommission for Singapore, I am not advocating that the  legal\r\n\r\nwhip be brandished at every opportunity.   Even in the United\r\n\r\nStates,  its EOC has placed increasing emphasis on mediation,\r\n\r\nrather  than  taking employers to court.  In  Australia,  its\r\n\r\nCommissioner for Equal Opportunity investigates and tries  to\r\n\r\nconciliate   complaints.    The   Commissioner   refers   the\r\n\r\ncomplaints  to the Equal Opportunity Tribunal only  when  the\r\n\r\nconciliation  process  has  failed.   The  Equal  Opportunity\r\n\r\nTribunal is an independent statutory body in Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may be concerned whether this mechanism will\r\n\r\nintroduce job rigidities and affect economic growth.   It  is\r\n\r\nan  unnecessary worry.  There is little evidence of  this  in\r\n\r\nthe  countries that have the equal opportunity laws.  Indeed,\r\n\r\none  can  argue  that it strengthens the  job  market  as  it\r\n\r\nensures transparency and meritocracy; the best person for the\r\n\r\njob.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having an EOC alone, I submit, may not be adequate\r\n\r\nfor  the  challenges ahead.  We need more.  We also  need  to\r\n\r\nbuild institutional pillars for specific areas.  If I may,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like to focus on two areas: gender equality and multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women in Singapore have made great strides in Singapore\r\n\r\nover  the years, yet they are still under-represented in  the\r\n\r\nupper  echelons of power in society.  Women have a particular\r\n\r\ninterest  in  ensuring that our social and economic  policies\r\n\r\nare sound. Women are often combining several jobs at one time\r\n\r\n-  as  a  mother, a wife, a caregiver to elderly  parents,  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer in the community, and as a worker.  They know  that\r\n\r\nissues like child care, access to healthcare services and  to\r\n\r\ntraining programmes are closely connected to their ability to\r\n\r\nparticipate on an equal basis in the labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the voices of women are heard at all\r\n\r\nlevels  and that their potential is maximised, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  set  up  a  national  body  to  promote  their   full\r\n\r\nparticipation in the economic, social, cultural and political\r\n\r\nlife of the country.  Why not set up a Women Affairs Ministry\r\n\r\nor  department  for this?  Or at the very least,  a  National\r\n\r\nWomen's Council, on par with the National Youth Council which\r\n\r\nis headed by a Cabinet Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries have entire Ministries or departments to\r\n\r\npromote  the status of women and their full integration  into\r\n\r\nthe national development process. These countries include the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia,  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nSri  Lanka,  Sweden and Fiji.  In Sweden,  its  Minister  for\r\n\r\nGender  Equality  Affairs works with  the  Equal  Opportunity\r\n\r\nOmbudsman  to promote gender equality in working  life.   Not\r\n\r\nsurprisingly,  many of these countries have  produced  strong\r\n\r\nwomen leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it has been said that we are a patriarchal\r\n\r\nsociety  and some of our policies have to reflect this,  such\r\n\r\nas medical benefits for civil servants.  But the last time  I\r\n\r\nchecked the Constitution, Sir, I did not see patriarchy being\r\n\r\nenshrined  as one of its founding principles.  The  principle\r\n\r\nof equality and non-discrimination is.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may turn to multi-racialism. We stand for\r\n\r\nmulti-racialism  and gradual integration  but  presently,  we\r\n\r\nlack national institutions to promote it in a coordinated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  concerted  way.   We have the Maintenance  of  Religious\r\n\r\nHarmony Act, but it is preventive.  It  prevents matters from\r\n\r\nescalating  and  creating  tensions  and  conflicts   between\r\n\r\ndifferent religious groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the Presidential Council for Minority\r\n\r\nRights.   Its role is also preventive.  It is to  review  and\r\n\r\ndraw  attention to any Bill or to any subsidiary  legislation\r\n\r\nthat,  when  put in practice, might discriminate against  any\r\n\r\nracial   or   religious  community.   They  serve   important\r\n\r\nfunctions,  but  neither is set up to promote multi-racialism\r\n\r\npositively and to push the multi-racial agenda forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has recently set up a new National\r\n\r\nSteering Committee on the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles  to\r\n\r\nfoster  confidence between the different races.   This  is  a\r\n\r\npromising  step forward.  But I would argue that it  can  and\r\n\r\nshould  go  further.  We should build on this gradually.   In\r\n\r\ntime, it should be the umbrella body for all the ethnic-based\r\n\r\nself-help groups and be the institution to promote  a  multi-racial  approach  to  solving  problems.    I  hope  we  will\r\n\r\neventually  also  see a Minister in charge of  multi-cultural\r\n\r\naffairs  overseeing this crucial area,  just  as  we  have  a\r\n\r\nMinister  in  charge of Muslim Affairs overseeing  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity's interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is important to institutionalise our founding\r\n\r\nprinciples because they define who we are as a people and  as\r\n\r\na  nation.  Our founding fathers had fought long and hard for\r\n\r\nthese  principles  of equality and multi-racialism.   It  was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  these principles that Singapore  separated  from\r\n\r\nMalaysia and we are today an independent country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these principles strike a deep chord in me. I left\r\n\r\nMalaysia  for  Singapore when I was 16 because  this  country\r\n\r\noffered  me  the opportunity to live my life based  on  these\r\n\r\nprinciples.   I became a Singaporean because I wanted to be a\r\n\r\npart  of a country that upholds these principles.  Its ideals\r\n\r\nhave  become my own.  And I became an MP because  I  want  to\r\n\r\ncontribute  to a country that pursues these precious  ideals.\r\n\r\nI know only too well that they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  be  taken  for granted.  We need to  institutionalise\r\n\r\nthem.  Leaders may come and go, but institutions stay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President called on us to remake\r\n\r\nSingapore  together, so that we will continue to  thrive  and\r\n\r\nprosper  as  a  country.  Sir, the Government also  needs  to\r\n\r\nremake  itself,  to  respond  more  readily  to  the  genuine\r\n\r\nconcerns  of  the people.  I have met too many  Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially   younger   Singaporeans  who   wonder,   somewhat\r\n\r\nsceptically,  whether  the Government really  listens.   They\r\n\r\nsay,  \"Why bother to speak up when the Government has already\r\n\r\nmade up its mind?\"  But to take this attitude is to throw  in\r\n\r\nthe  towel  even  before  the bell  rings.   \"Why?\"  a  young\r\n\r\nSingaporean  might ask, \"Why should I get  involved  in  this\r\n\r\ndifficult process of remaking Singapore?\"  To answer that  it\r\n\r\nis  for this country's survival is only begging the question,\r\n\r\nbecause why is this country's survival so important?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is a big place. When the going gets tough, we\r\n\r\ncan  disperse  and leave for other lands as  our  forefathers\r\n\r\ndid.  I would answer that Singaporean this way - because this\r\n\r\nis  the  very  essence of being a Singaporean!  It  is  about\r\n\r\novercoming   adversity.   It  is  a  personal  and   national\r\n\r\ninvestment  in a future that we hope to create for  ourselves\r\n\r\nand  our children, with a national character we can be  proud\r\n\r\nof  and  can call our own.  But more importantly, it must  be\r\n\r\nbecause   we  want  to  realise  our  hopes  and  ideals   as\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  -  one  united  people,  regardless  of   race,\r\n\r\nlanguage and religion, building a democratic society based on\r\n\r\njustice and equality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise\r\n\r\nto support the motion of thanks to our President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Speech to this House, the President reminded all\r\n\r\nSingaporeans that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the  world has changed.\"  To me, this describes the crux  of\r\n\r\nthe challenge that we face.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, technology has bound all parts of our world more\r\n\r\ntightly  together.   In this sense, it  has  made  our  world\r\n\r\nsmaller.   In  this  smaller  and  more  crowded  world,  all\r\n\r\ncountries  and  peoples vie constantly with one  another  for\r\n\r\nresources,  opportunities and results.  Power  and  influence\r\n\r\nare  also  peddled on a global scale by all kinds of  forces,\r\n\r\nsome  legitimate  and  others not.   In  this  global  stage,\r\n\r\nwinners  win  big.   Losers  also lose  big.   Societies  are\r\n\r\ntherefore  stressed  by  competition,  and  strained  by  the\r\n\r\naccentuated differences in outcomes and increased dislocation\r\n\r\nof people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid such whirling change, people seek relief, solace\r\n\r\nand  expression  in solidarity with others  like  themselves.\r\n\r\nTransnational  and  supranational forces of  race,  religion,\r\n\r\nclass, business and even iconic worship have become stronger.\r\n\r\nWhile  they  may help bring comfort, hope and gain  to  their\r\n\r\nsupporters,  they  can  also affect  and  amplify  underlying\r\n\r\ntensions  and  cracks in society, rendering the governing  of\r\n\r\nnations ever more difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my work as Mayor, as Member of Parliament and\r\n\r\nwith  the  trade union movement, I see these trends  and  its\r\n\r\nforces  being played out in the lives of ordinary people.   I\r\n\r\nthink that it is important for Singapore to put in effort  in\r\n\r\nthree areas in the context of the world that we now face,  so\r\n\r\nthat we can continue to be successful.  And these are helping\r\n\r\nthe   individual   develop  and   deal   with   change,   the\r\n\r\nstrengthening of adjustment infrastructure and the  promotion\r\n\r\nof social cohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for more than 30 years, Singapore has succeeded\r\n\r\nagainst the odds through a combination of right policies  and\r\n\r\ntight organisation.  In that time, we have moved from being a\r\n\r\ncheap  operational  base to a high value-added  location.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve  we  have moved ourselves as far as that formula  can\r\n\r\ntake  us.   From here on, we will have to contend  with  many\r\n\r\nothers  who  have much larger endowments of land,  population\r\n\r\nand market, in an environment that is decidedly much more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncertain  than before.  And in such a setting,  we  must  go\r\n\r\nbeyond picking winning industries to creating an overall more\r\n\r\nconducive and vibrant business environment.  Our hope must be\r\n\r\nthat  the  life  force in such an environment  will  generate\r\n\r\ninnovation,  possibilities  and the  growth  of  winners  and\r\n\r\nwinning  industries, thereby creating more jobs and uplifting\r\n\r\nthe  living  standard of Singaporeans.  But my  concentration\r\n\r\ntoday   is   on  the  individual.   How  is  the   individual\r\n\r\nSingaporean, regardless of age, to be developed  so  that  he\r\n\r\ncan  fit well into such an environment, and thrive amid  such\r\n\r\nchange?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to highlight three factors that I\r\n\r\nbelieve will drive successful outcome.  First, the individual\r\n\r\nmust  have  more understanding of the situation  that  he  is\r\n\r\ngetting into.  Although this seems obvious enough, I think it\r\n\r\ncannot be presumed upon.  For many years now, the message  of\r\n\r\ntraining for employability has been highlighted.  Yet,  there\r\n\r\nremain  large  numbers  of  employees,  including  those   at\r\n\r\nexecutive levels, who had not yet taken action.  Perhaps many\r\n\r\ndid  not get the message.  Maybe others did not believe  that\r\n\r\nthey   would   fall   prey  to  restructuring.    While   the\r\n\r\nretrenchments   during  this  ongoing  recession   may   have\r\n\r\npunctured  such  illusions of security for many,  more  still\r\n\r\nneeds  to  be  done.   And  the earlier  we  get  our  entire\r\n\r\nworkforce  to  understand the situation and its urgency,  the\r\n\r\nearlier we start on the road to adjustment and adaptation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must emphasise the importance of resilience\r\n\r\nand  resourcefulness in individual development.   Traditional\r\n\r\ntraining  has  concentrated on technical  skills.   This  was\r\n\r\npartly  due  to the strong focus on the manufacturing  needs,\r\n\r\nand  partly because technical skills tended to be  easier  to\r\n\r\ngauge  and test.  While competence in technical content  must\r\n\r\nremain  an  important and integral part of training,  support\r\n\r\nfor   training   that  improves  individual  confidence   and\r\n\r\nflexibility   must  be  increased.   In  a   more   uncertain\r\n\r\nenvironment, our people must not only be very good at scaling\r\n\r\nladders,  but  they  must  also be  quick  to  determine  for\r\n\r\nthemselves which are the right ladders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto scale in the battlefield, given the overall mission.  This\r\n\r\nadaptability is critical in maximising our capacity to  seize\r\n\r\nopportunities  and  minimising  the  risk  of  premature   or\r\n\r\npermanent dislocation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must enable more individual-initiated training\r\n\r\nto  take  place.   Looking at the jobs that  the  EDB-induced\r\n\r\ninvestments create, we can say that some two-thirds to  four-fifths of them require skilled manpower, increasingly of very\r\n\r\nspecialised  kinds.  I think that mirrors the changing  skill\r\n\r\nneeds  elsewhere  in  the economy. With  growing  demand  for\r\n\r\nskilled manpower, can we therefore assume that companies will\r\n\r\ndevote more resources to training their workers to meet their\r\n\r\nown needs?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view, this may not necessarily be so. Why?\r\n\r\nBecause  many  companies, especially SMEs, have traditionally\r\n\r\nnot  been able or not willing to send their workers for  much\r\n\r\ntraining,  while  all companies will face rapidly  shortening\r\n\r\nproduct cycles.  The end result might be a tendency to  \"buy\"\r\n\r\nthe  needed  skilled  manpower from the  market  rather  than\r\n\r\ninvest  directly  in training.  And when  that  happens,  and\r\n\r\nwhere  there  is  a shortage of skilled manpower,  a  vicious\r\n\r\ncycle  of  increased  cost, stunted company  development  and\r\n\r\ndislocation  of  obsolete  manpower  will  form.   From   the\r\n\r\nnation's  perspective,  we have  to  see  how  best  to  help\r\n\r\nindividuals    initiate   their   own    skills    upgrading,\r\n\r\ncomplementary to how we help companies train their  manpower,\r\n\r\nas  that  would enhance the employability of workers and,  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time,  help  create a  supply  of  needed  skilled\r\n\r\nmanpower for industries' use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, beyond what the individual must be motivated or\r\n\r\nassisted  to  do,  there  is also the  need  to  enhance  the\r\n\r\ntransition  infrastructure.  Here,  I  am  thinking  of  such\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  industries such  as  counselling  and  job\r\n\r\nplacement.   In  an economy that has seen almost  continuous,\r\n\r\nstrong  and  steady growth over 30 years, where  unemployment\r\n\r\nhas been effectively negative, there is no big need for well-developed   transition  infrastructure  or  expertise.    Put\r\n\r\nsimply, when jobs are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchasing   after  people,  there  is  little  need  for   such\r\n\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road ahead is very different. Intermittent periods\r\n\r\nof  unemployment caused by the restructuring of companies and\r\n\r\nindustries will become more common.  And this will happen not\r\n\r\nonly   during  recessions  but  even  when  the  economy   is\r\n\r\nregistering  good growth.  Old jobs will go,  never  to  come\r\n\r\nback.   Those affected may be young or old, rank-and-file  or\r\n\r\nexecutive.  Not all of them will find new work easily.   Some\r\n\r\nmay  be  at  real risk of becoming permanently dislocated  or\r\n\r\nstructurally unemployed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, experience on the ground has shown that when left\r\n\r\non their own, displaced workers tend to look for, or wait for\r\n\r\na  new  job  that is very similar to the one that  they  have\r\n\r\nlost.   This  is  their  way  of  operating  within  familiar\r\n\r\nterritory,  hoping at the same time that relevant  experience\r\n\r\nwill help fetch a better pay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the economy restructures, the need to change\r\n\r\nlines  of work, to retool for a completely new industry  will\r\n\r\nbecome  part and parcel of the job search process.  The  need\r\n\r\nto  facilitate the crossing of a proportion of the  workforce\r\n\r\nfrom  one  job  to another, from one sector to another,  will\r\n\r\nbecome  a standard feature of our landscape.  This capability\r\n\r\nto  work with displaced employees at the technical, emotional\r\n\r\nand practical levels to bring about acceptance and adaptation\r\n\r\ndoes not happen on its own but must be developed.  And I hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  relevant Ministries can look into this  suggestion\r\n\r\nand  see  how we can add to the further development  of  such\r\n\r\ncapability,  building  on  current  efforts,  such  as  those\r\n\r\nchampioned  by  the  Manpower Ministry and  the  trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement.   This  is a capability, whether performed  by  the\r\n\r\npublic or private sectors, which the country will need on  an\r\n\r\nongoing basis from now on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area of focus that I want to highlight is\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of social cohesion.  Singapore  suffers  from\r\n\r\nsevere inherent constraints of land and population.  We  have\r\n\r\nvery little to play with,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  we enjoy very little margin of error indeed.  Our people\r\n\r\nare  literally  our  only resource.  If our  social  cohesion\r\n\r\nerodes, our country cannot remain strong, regardless  of  our\r\n\r\nsystems  and  technology.  Our unity is  our  own  hope,  and\r\n\r\ndisunity will be our ruin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact must spur us to do all we can to promote\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion.  We must undertake a myriad  of  activities\r\n\r\nregularly  to  nurture  a  sense of common  identity,  common\r\n\r\nspace,  common good and common destiny.  This can  only  come\r\n\r\nabout  through broadening the mutual understanding and mutual\r\n\r\nrespect   among   the   different   communities,   and    the\r\n\r\nstrengthening   of   national   education.    By    different\r\n\r\ncommunities, I refer not only to the obvious ones of race and\r\n\r\nreligion  but  also  the less obvious ones,  such  as  income\r\n\r\nstrata  and educational levels.  We must do our best to  help\r\n\r\ndifferent segments of society reach out to the others, to get\r\n\r\nthe  more  able  to help the less fortunate,  the  strong  to\r\n\r\nuplift  the  weak.  We must carefully consider  the  enhanced\r\n\r\nroles   that   community,  clan,  religious   and   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisations should play.  We must not forget the place  and\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  good corporate citizenship.   We  should\r\n\r\nalso review the components of our social safety net to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they are able to help citizens in a timely manner  amid\r\n\r\nturbulence, and yet continue to motivate a strong work  ethic\r\n\r\nand self-responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, despite our best efforts, there will\r\n\r\nbe  those who will not place national solidarity above  other\r\n\r\nconsiderations.  I urge continuous vigilance  against   those\r\n\r\nwho  seek to undermine the basis for peaceful coexistence  of\r\n\r\nall  in multi-racial Singapore.  We must always bear in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  we are not undertaking this task in isolation.  We  are\r\n\r\ndoing  so  in  the  context of a globalised  world  in  which\r\n\r\nforces  tuck  at  primordial  instincts.   This  is  not   an\r\n\r\nabstract,   academic   exercise  but  one   that   ultimately\r\n\r\ndetermines our viability as a society and nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the world that we have to navigate in\r\n\r\nhas become much more complex and treacherous.  We have to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnimble   to  adapt  to  the  changes  and  swift   to   seize\r\n\r\nopportunities and avoid disaster.  It will be difficult,  but\r\n\r\nwe  will  not be cowed.  Singapore has succeeded despite  the\r\n\r\nodds   through  the  indomitable  spirit  and  grit  of   our\r\n\r\nleadership and our people.  And I am sure that we will  again\r\n\r\nrise to the occasion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI rise in support of the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is at the turning point. Rapid globalisation\r\n\r\nhas  posed  formidable  challenges to  our  country  and  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Globalisation will continue to impact the political,\r\n\r\neconomic  and  social dimensions of Singapore, and  push  for\r\n\r\nchanges  which are inevitable.  Singaporeans must  face  this\r\n\r\nreality that we are living in a globalised world today.   Any\r\n\r\nevent or happening outside Singapore will have almost instant\r\n\r\nrepercussions  on  us,  be  it politically,  economically  or\r\n\r\nsocially.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent financial crisis and terrorist attacks are\r\n\r\nclear examples of how global or regional events have affected\r\n\r\nthe   quality   of  life  of  Singaporeans.   We  experienced\r\n\r\npolitical  brickbats, hollowing out of our economy,  loss  of\r\n\r\njobs,  and  threats  to  our security  and  social  cohesion.\r\n\r\nToday, we live in a connected world.  Singaporeans must learn\r\n\r\nhow to be global citizens and cope with global challenges.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, how can Singapore be a global player?\r\n\r\nHow can Singaporeans be global citizens?  What must we do  to\r\n\r\nmake  a  living  in the global market?  These  are  pertinent\r\n\r\nquestions which all Singaporeans must address.  It is not the\r\n\r\nsole  responsibility of Government.  Every  Singaporean  must\r\n\r\nplay a role to make Singapore a global player.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To successfully position Singapore in the global market,\r\n\r\nwe  need to understand our strengths and weaknesses,  and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same  time the opportunities and threats in  the  global\r\n\r\nmarketplace.  We know our weaknesses.  Singapore has  limited\r\n\r\nnatural  resources.   We  also have a  small  population  and\r\n\r\ntalent base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we do have certain unique competitive strengths. We\r\n\r\nenjoy strong political and social stability.  We have a world-class infrastructure for our people and businesses.  We  have\r\n\r\na   hardworking   and  educated  workforce.   And,   finally,\r\n\r\nSingapore is a beautiful country which receives accolades  of\r\n\r\nadmiration from people all over the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how can we harness our strengths to spearhead\r\n\r\nefforts  to cope with globalisation?  I would like to suggest\r\n\r\na  three-pronged strategy.  We should focus on  three  areas:\r\n\r\nIntegration, Teamwork and Quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Integration</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)  Integrating Government Ministries and Agencies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the Ministry of Information,\r\n\r\nCommunications  and  the Arts' vision  to  make  Singapore  a\r\n\r\nconnected   and   creative  island.   With  the   advent   of\r\n\r\ninformation  technology and modern communication devices,  we\r\n\r\ncan  easily  connect  the  Government,  business  and  people\r\n\r\nsectors   of  Singapore.   We  must  remove  all  territorial\r\n\r\nbarriers among Ministries and Government agencies to  achieve\r\n\r\none integrated Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public sector must take proactive measures to\r\n\r\nintegrate  Government agencies and services to  provide  more\r\n\r\none-stop   service  centres  for  our  people  and   business\r\n\r\ncommunity.   For  example, the housing of various  Government\r\n\r\nagencies  in the Woodlands Civic Centre provides a convenient\r\n\r\none-stop  access  for  residents and businesses.   We  should\r\n\r\ndevelop  more  of  such centres, and also a one-stop  website\r\n\r\nproviding all Government services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eCitizen website is a good example of how Government\r\n\r\nservices and information can be integrated to provide a  one-stop   24-hour  service  centre.   We  should  expedite   the\r\n\r\nintegration  process,  and  similarly  set  up   a   one-stop\r\n\r\neBusiness   website  for  businesses.   The  integration   of\r\n\r\nGovernment  agencies and services will definitely  provide  a\r\n\r\nboost to higher productivity and better quality of services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Integrating our Universities and Research Institutions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country with limited land area. We\r\n\r\nshould consolidate our resources instead of having many small\r\n\r\nset-ups.   We  must  aim  to  be a world-class  learning  and\r\n\r\nresearch   centre.    Instead  of  having   three   or   four\r\n\r\nuniversities  and  several research institutions  engaged  in\r\n\r\nlocal  competition, we should compete with other  world-class\r\n\r\nresearch   institutions  to  attract  top-notch   talent   to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should integrate all our universities and research\r\n\r\ninstitutions  into a mega university.  In global competition,\r\n\r\nsize  does matter.  A mega university will be more attractive\r\n\r\nto  talent.  It will help to spearhead Singapore's innovation\r\n\r\nand  creative  efforts.   We should  build  one  world  class\r\n\r\nuniversity   which  can  provide  first-class  learning   and\r\n\r\nresearch   environment  to  the  world.    The   quality   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's education system does provide niches  for  us  to\r\n\r\nprovide world-class education and research services.  We must\r\n\r\naim  to  be  an innovation centre which produces  recipe  for\r\n\r\nsuccess, new products and services, and best practices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(iii)     Integrating our construction industry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction industry has always been a \"low\r\n\r\nproductivity\" industry.  Despite all efforts by the  Building\r\n\r\nand  Construction Authority (BCA), productivity remains  low.\r\n\r\nWhy  is  construction productivity low in Singapore?  Let  me\r\n\r\nexplain  the phenomenon.  Almost every building in  Singapore\r\n\r\nis  developed  by different teams of developers,  consultants\r\n\r\nand  contractors.   A  building is a  complex  product  which\r\n\r\ncomprises  the  inputs  of  a  few  hundred  trades  such  as\r\n\r\nconcrete,   steel,  bricks,  tiles,  glass,  electrical   and\r\n\r\nmechanical products, and many others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every building project, the developer will specify\r\n\r\ndifferent  design  and  building material  requirements.   As\r\n\r\nsuch, there is always a learning curve for the designers  and\r\n\r\ncontractors  in  every  single project.   This  situation  is\r\n\r\nfurther aggravated by\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  lack  of  standardisation and  modular  coordination  of\r\n\r\nbuilding  components.  Columns, beams, doors, windows,  tiles\r\n\r\nand  fittings  all come in different shapes and  sizes,  thus\r\n\r\nmaking   it   difficult  to  achieve  high  productivity   in\r\n\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage creative design, there is an urgent\r\n\r\nneed to promote more standardisation and modular coordination\r\n\r\nin  the  construction industry.  We must also  integrate  our\r\n\r\ndesign  and  construction  teams through  design  and  build.\r\n\r\nDevelopers must be encouraged to support standardisation  and\r\n\r\ndry   construction  methods  such  as  precast  and  off-site\r\n\r\nfabrication,  without  which construction  productivity  will\r\n\r\nalways be low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another contributing factor to the low construction\r\n\r\nproductivity  is  the  lack of mandate of  the  Building  and\r\n\r\nConstruction  Authority.  BCA does not control the  provision\r\n\r\nof  manpower and administer building regulations, which  come\r\n\r\nunder  MOM.   It does not implement standards  and  codes  of\r\n\r\npractice,   which  is  the  responsibility   of   PSB.    The\r\n\r\nEnvironment  Ministry  regulates  environmental  and   public\r\n\r\nhealth matters on construction sites.  With so many different\r\n\r\nagencies  acting  together with different  agendas,  how  can\r\n\r\nbuilding  projects progress smoothly on  site?   We  need  to\r\n\r\nreview   and   integrate   all  regulations   affecting   the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry and encourage more self-regulation.  We\r\n\r\nalso need to remake BCA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Teamwork</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)  Friends to all countries</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no man is an island. Although\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  an  island, we must work as a  team  with  the\r\n\r\ninternational  community.  As a country, we  should  continue\r\n\r\nour  foreign  policy to be friends with as many countries  as\r\n\r\npossible.  We must be committed to ASEAN and be supportive of\r\n\r\ninternational   organisations,  in  particular   the   United\r\n\r\nNations.   We  must  strengthen our  friendships  with  other\r\n\r\ncountries and forge economic partnerships where possible  for\r\n\r\nmutual  benefit.   The pursuit of Free Trade Agreements  will\r\n\r\nprovide excellent opportunities for businesses to collaborate\r\n\r\nand provide\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproducts and services to growing markets such as China, Korea\r\n\r\nand Indochina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Building a Singapore Team</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back home, we should encourage our people to work\r\n\r\nclosely  as a team to compete globally.  We need to  build  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  Team  and  brand our team.  Both  our  Government-linked  companies and local businesses must work as  partners\r\n\r\nto provide global products and services.  We should work as a\r\n\r\nteam  to  develop  more  world-class  companies.   Thus,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  must  provide  more  support  to  nurture   local\r\n\r\nbusinesses to be global players.  The public sector and  GLCs\r\n\r\nshould  also make concrete efforts to support local SMEs  and\r\n\r\nprovide opportunities for them to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLCs should reduce its local market share and give local\r\n\r\nbusinesses  opportunity to provide their  services  and  gain\r\n\r\nexperience.  We need the inertia from the private  sector  to\r\n\r\ndrive  our  products and services overseas.  We  should  also\r\n\r\nreduce   the   stake  of  Government  in  GLCs  and   provide\r\n\r\nopportunities  for  private  entrepreneurs  to  build   niche\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   In addition, GLCs can support local  businesses\r\n\r\nwhen venturing overseas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii)     Teamwork in Government Ministries and Agencies</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide quality services for both our people and\r\n\r\nbusinesses,  we need teamwork from all Government  Ministries\r\n\r\nand  agencies.  Staff from the public sector must  understand\r\n\r\nthe  macro perspective of policies and procedures.  They must\r\n\r\nexercise more flexibility to safeguard the interests  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  and  business.   Top civil  servants  and  Government\r\n\r\nagencies'  chiefs  must  adopt both horizontal  and  vertical\r\n\r\ncoordination  and  teamwork.  Physical  and  mental  barriers\r\n\r\nacross Ministries and Government agencies must be removed  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate workflows and better delivery of services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, top management in the public sector must\r\n\r\nadopt  a  more hands-on approach in formulating policies  and\r\n\r\nprocedures.  While we do not encourage micro-management,  top\r\n\r\nmanagement\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  constantly  be  in touch with their  ground  staff  and\r\n\r\ncustomers to continually upgrade their operations.  A  hands-on  approach will definitely provide more support and impetus\r\n\r\nin delivery of world-class services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Quality</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)  Developing a quality culture and workforce</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve sustainable competitive advantage, we need to\r\n\r\nfocus  on the quality of our products and services.  We  must\r\n\r\ninculcate  a  quality  culture in  our  workforce,  like  the\r\n\r\nJapanese.   Workers  must understand and  be  convinced  that\r\n\r\nquality will ensure the survival of their companies and jobs.\r\n\r\nAlthough PSB has been spearheading the quality drive  through\r\n\r\nthe  ISO  9000 and Singapore Quality Award schemes, not  many\r\n\r\nlocal firms have achieved world-class quality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, the retail and construction sectors\r\n\r\nsuffer  from the image of poor quality of services.  We  need\r\n\r\nto  address  the issue of quality of services in  our  retail\r\n\r\nindustry.   Efforts by the Government to upgrade  the  retail\r\n\r\nindustry  will  not  succeed if  there  is  no  business  for\r\n\r\nretailers.   The  constant  push by  PSB  to  upgrade  retail\r\n\r\nbusinesses may suffer backlash, resulting in higher  business\r\n\r\ncosts and business failures.  Instead, we should focus on how\r\n\r\nto  bring business to businesses.  This is especially  so  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  where  we  have an oversupply of  retail  outlets.\r\n\r\nWhen  there  is  business, businesses will  be  motivated  to\r\n\r\nfurther improve their operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the construction industry, our open tendering\r\n\r\nsystem   has   severe   setbacks  in  ensuring   quality   of\r\n\r\nconstruction.   The competitive nature and low profit  margin\r\n\r\nin  construction do not provide much room for contractors  to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  quality.   Many developers, including  the  public\r\n\r\nsector,  are  reluctant to pay a premium  for  quality  work.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,   there   is  inadequate   independent   quality\r\n\r\nassessment  and easily accessible information on the  quality\r\n\r\nperformance  of  developers, designers and contractors.   The\r\n\r\nBuilding and Construction Authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshould  develop  a web-based database on the  performance  of\r\n\r\ndevelopers,  designers and contractors.  We must also  review\r\n\r\nthe quality incentives for the construction industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii) Developing a Quality Tourism Hub</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore aspires to be a tourism hub. Each year, we\r\n\r\nattract  about  7  million tourists to  Singapore.   If  each\r\n\r\ntourist spends $200 in our retail outlets, we should  have  a\r\n\r\nbillion-dollar  retail  industry.   Is  this  the   case   in\r\n\r\nSingapore?   We may need to check whether the GST  rebate  by\r\n\r\ntourists  indicates  the  size of tourist  dollars  spent  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   With so many countries competing  for  tourists,\r\n\r\nSingapore must establish our niches to attract tourists  from\r\n\r\nall  countries.  Presently, our tourist attractions, such  as\r\n\r\nSentosa,  Zoo,  Bird Park and Botanic Garden  are  facing  an\r\n\r\nuphill  task  to  attract  tourists.   We  need  new  tourist\r\n\r\nattractions and more aggressive marketing of our attractions.\r\n\r\nWe  have to market Singapore as a world-class city worthwhile\r\n\r\nvisiting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The low crime rate and safe environment, coupled with\r\n\r\nour  beautiful  garden  city, provide  excellent  niches  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  to be a tourist attraction.  We should  capitalise\r\n\r\non  this  to organise or bid for more world leaders meetings,\r\n\r\ninternational  conferences,  trade  exhibitions,  forums  and\r\n\r\ngatherings.   We  can  be the \"World Business  Centre\"  where\r\n\r\npolitical,  economic and social discussions take  place.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  we  should develop Singapore into a food  paradise\r\n\r\nwith  a  wide  range  of international  and  local  cuisines,\r\n\r\nranging from hawker centres to fine dining outlets.  The East\r\n\r\nCoast  Park  can be converted into a \"World Food Paradise  or\r\n\r\nEsplanade\"  where the best food in Singapore  can  be  housed\r\n\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to remake our Singapore Tourism Board\r\n\r\n(STB).   Tourism can be a key driver of our service industry.\r\n\r\nIt provides many jobs which our older workers can do, such as\r\n\r\ntour   guides,  housekeepers,  drivers,  customer   relations\r\n\r\nofficers, chefs, and so on.  We must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmore proactive to attract more tourists.  STB must reach  out\r\n\r\nand  encourage tourists to spend money in Singapore,  instead\r\n\r\nof   using  Singapore  as  a  transit  centre.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nrevitalise the Singapore Tourism Board, Orchard Road, and our\r\n\r\ntourist   attractions.   I  am  sure  Singapore  can   easily\r\n\r\naccommodate 10 to 12 million tourists a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii) Quality of life.</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad to say, Singapore has no quality of life index or\r\n\r\nmeasure  to  monitor our efforts in improving the quality  of\r\n\r\nlife  of  Singaporeans.  Although many  Ministries  have  put\r\n\r\nforward statements of vision and mission, no quality of  life\r\n\r\nmeasures  were  stated to determine whether we have  achieved\r\n\r\nour vision and mission.  Many countries have some measures or\r\n\r\nbenchmarks of quality of life.  To be a world-class city,  we\r\n\r\nneed  to establish our own set of quality of life indicators.\r\n\r\nThis  is to ensure that we utilise our resources properly  to\r\n\r\nimprove the lives of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me cite one example to illustrate the\r\n\r\nimportance  of having quality of life indicators  to  measure\r\n\r\nthe  performance of the public sector.  Every year, we  spend\r\n\r\nbillions  of  dollars  to  develop  and  maintain  parks   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  However, not many Singaporeans visit these parks,\r\n\r\nespecially the national parks.  The lack of accessibility and\r\n\r\nsupporting infrastructure has deterred many from visiting our\r\n\r\nparks.   Not  many activities or programmes are organised  to\r\n\r\nattract Singaporeans to the parks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, inadequate or paid car parking has always\r\n\r\ndeterred people from going to the parks.  Sir, I am surprised\r\n\r\nto  learn  that you need to pay $1 for taking a walk  at  the\r\n\r\nSungei Buloh nature trail.  How many Singaporeans are willing\r\n\r\nto pay $1 per walk?  The \"pay as you use\" principle or policy\r\n\r\nmust be reviewed to facilitate better usage of our parks  and\r\n\r\nnature  reserves.  The Government must invest  in  the  well-being of our people.  The use of parks has proved to be  good\r\n\r\nrelaxation places for many people in other countries.   There\r\n\r\nis  no point spending so much on parks when the utility is so\r\n\r\nlow.   Our  National Parks Board should be more proactive  to\r\n\r\nbring life into our parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a good quality of life, Singaporeans must learn\r\n\r\nhow  to  work hard, stay healthy and enjoy life.  Maybe,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Information, Communications and the Arts  should\r\n\r\nset  up a Department of Enjoyment to help Singaporeans  enjoy\r\n\r\nlife.  To be a world-class city, we need to have a measure of\r\n\r\nour quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am confident that Singaporeans will\r\n\r\nstay  united  and integrated.  We will work  as  a  team  and\r\n\r\nprovide world-class products and services.  Together, we  can\r\n\r\nmake Singapore a world-class city.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  in  support of the motion of thanks for the President's\r\n\r\nAddress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I concur with the President's sentiments that we\r\n\r\nare  standing at the crossroads, and for the next  few  years\r\n\r\nwill  be  confronted  with  the  most  severe  challenges  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's history.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the changed environment we are in, there are\r\n\r\nseveral  critical  stress  points  that  could  become   more\r\n\r\npronounced in the future.  I would like to elaborate on three\r\n\r\nof  these  stress points and the need to provide  relief  for\r\n\r\nthem  so  that  they  do  not manifest themselves  into  more\r\n\r\nserious ailments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first stress point relates to the people-Government\r\n\r\nrelationship.   There  is  a danger of  an  increasing  chasm\r\n\r\nbetween the Government and its people which the President  in\r\n\r\nhis  Address  identifies broadly as the  need  for  political\r\n\r\nrenewal.  It is undeniable that the political leadership  has\r\n\r\nover the last 36-37 years done much good for Singapore.  Most\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have  a  tacit  understanding  that  Government\r\n\r\npolicies  have good intentions.  It is just like the  boy  in\r\n\r\nJack  Neo's show \"I Not Stupid\" who said, \"My mother is  like\r\n\r\nthe Government.  Everything she does is - for our own good.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's past successes have hinged on meritocracy\r\n\r\nand  pragmatism.   Hitherto, economic issues drive  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  rightly  so in view of her limited resources,  smallness\r\n\r\nand  thus vulnerability.  Feedback from constituents suggests\r\n\r\nthat Singaporeans, especially the younger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngeneration,  increasingly want to have a  say  in  Government\r\n\r\npolicies.   While  there  has  been  more  consultation   and\r\n\r\ndialogue with the citizenry over the last few years, there is\r\n\r\nstill  a  feeling that there is some way to go with  the  new\r\n\r\nconsultative approach.  Out-of-bound markers must be  widened\r\n\r\nin  order  to engage Singaporeans, harness their  energy  and\r\n\r\nideas and help them take ownership of the policies that  will\r\n\r\nshape  Singapore's  future, thus increasing  their  sense  of\r\n\r\nrootedness.   I  therefore welcome the President's  call  for\r\n\r\nopening  up more space for Singaporeans to debate on national\r\n\r\npolicies and issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the engagement between the Government and the\r\n\r\npeople  must  go  beyond mere rhetoric.  The Government  must\r\n\r\nshow  that it values and takes its citizens' views seriously.\r\n\r\nIt  must  not be too quick to dismiss or put down  ideas  and\r\n\r\nfeedback  for,  after  all, no one can claim  a  monopoly  on\r\n\r\nknowledge, experience or wisdom.  Wherever possible,  debates\r\n\r\non policies should precede their implementation so that there\r\n\r\nwill  be  maximum buy-in and support when these policies  are\r\n\r\nput into practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government must take a proactive stance and respond\r\n\r\nquickly  to feedback and suggestions.  Feedback should  be  a\r\n\r\ntwo-way, not a one-way street.  Otherwise, the citizens  will\r\n\r\nview the Government feedback mechanism - however elaborate or\r\n\r\nsophisticated  - as a black hole, where under  the  force  of\r\n\r\ngravity,  no light emerges.  As a constituent once  cynically\r\n\r\nremarked  to  me  \"Where is the Government's feedback  to  my\r\n\r\nfeedback?\"    After  public  consultation  and  debate,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should  take  pains to indicate  the  changes  or\r\n\r\nrefinements  made  to its policies arising from  feedback  as\r\n\r\nwell as the reasons for rejecting other proposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must show that it will not hesitate to take concrete\r\n\r\naction  and  change  its  policies,  where  it  benefits  the\r\n\r\nmajority of Singaporeans, even if it involves an about change\r\n\r\nor about face of an existing policy, such as in the Chek Jawa\r\n\r\ncase.   Otherwise, many Singaporeans would continue  to  feel\r\n\r\nthat  dialogue  and  debate are mere  tokenism.   By  way  of\r\n\r\nanecdotal evidence of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  sentiment,  even  the  CEO of  an  established  private\r\n\r\ncompany  in  Singapore who has taken part  in  many  feedback\r\n\r\nsessions  and  sits on the Board of a GLC, told  me  recently\r\n\r\nthat  he himself is still very sceptical about the Government\r\n\r\nlistening  to concerns about the impact of its policies.   So\r\n\r\nthis  is not just the sentiment of the MP for Sembawang GRC's\r\n\r\ndaughter or young friends.  So what more the average  man-in-the-street,  most  of  whom have  chosen  to  be  the  silent\r\n\r\nmajority!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as the President has so rightly pointed\r\n\r\nout,  no  policy  is so cast in stone that it  can  never  be\r\n\r\nchanged.  To ensure that policies remain relevant and enhance\r\n\r\nrather  than  impede stakeholders' welfare,  as  the  MP  for\r\n\r\nSembawang  GRC  has so robustly argued, it  is  important  to\r\n\r\nremind civil servants who are the face of the Government  and\r\n\r\nfacilitators  of  Government policies, that  they  must  show\r\n\r\ncompassion, be less rule-book bound and listen with a  heart,\r\n\r\nnot just with the mind.  In other words, be customer-centric,\r\n\r\nin  form and substance.  Otherwise, they will not live up  to\r\n\r\ntheir title of \"civil servant\" and will be considered neither\r\n\r\ncivil nor servant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is acknowledged that the civil service and statutory\r\n\r\nboards have over the last few years improved tremendously  in\r\n\r\nthe  delivery  of  its  services to the  public.   My  recent\r\n\r\nexperience  as a private sector representative on  the  JTC's\r\n\r\nCustomer Services Panel and URA Concept Plan Review Committee\r\n\r\n2001  have been positive.  In these instances, the Government\r\n\r\norganisations concerned have been responsive to feedback  and\r\n\r\nhave  made  the  effort  to take into  account  some  of  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions  as  well  as  explain  why  others   cannot   be\r\n\r\nimplemented.   However, more can be done, so that  our  civil\r\n\r\nservice would be known not only for its incorruptibility  and\r\n\r\nefficiency but also for being in-tune with the people and the\r\n\r\nneeds of the time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my second point relates to the need for\r\n\r\nus to manage the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimbalances arising from an inevitable widening income  divide\r\n\r\namong  the  have-nots, the haves, and  the  have-lots,  as  a\r\n\r\nresult of the inexorable forces of globalisation and IT.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we promote entrepreneurship and risk-taking, there\r\n\r\nwill be fabulous successes but there will also be spectacular\r\n\r\nlosses.   To  quote  the  New York Times  journalist,  Thomas\r\n\r\nFriedman, there is no longer a First World, a Second World or\r\n\r\na  Third  World.   Only  a Fast World  where  the  forces  of\r\n\r\nglobalisation  are embraced and a Slow World,  where  nations\r\n\r\nand communities who fail to do so are left behind.  Singapore\r\n\r\ncould  become more and more a winner-takes-all society.   The\r\n\r\nrich  are  likely  to  get richer while the  poor  will  have\r\n\r\nincreasing difficulty to play catch-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to venture two proposals\r\n\r\nto  address the needs and concerns arising from this tendency\r\n\r\ntowards   greater  income  disparity.   Firstly,  as   income\r\n\r\ndisparity  becomes  more pronounced  and  as  job  insecurity\r\n\r\nincreases,  our  meritocratic  system  upon  which  much   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  success lies must be peppered with  a  lot  more\r\n\r\ncompassion  in its execution.  While we celebrate the  icons,\r\n\r\nthe  phoenixes, and the heroes of capitalism, we  must  never\r\n\r\nforget  those who are left behind.  A group is only as strong\r\n\r\nas  its  weakest member.  In a 4 x 100 metre  relay,  a  slow\r\n\r\nstart  by one runner, or a poor baton change by another,  can\r\n\r\ncost  the  team  a medal.  We thus need to temper  capitalism\r\n\r\nwith compassion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing financial assistance schemes for the low income\r\n\r\ngroups,  the  handicapped,  the sick  and  at  risk  families\r\n\r\nadministered by grassroots organisations,  the CDCs and  MCDS\r\n\r\nare  to  be applauded.  However, there is a need for constant\r\n\r\nreview of such schemes as regards, say, the qualifying income\r\n\r\nceiling and the quantum of such financial assistance as  well\r\n\r\nas  the  criteria  and conditions under which  assistance  is\r\n\r\ndispensed   in   order   to   ensure   their   adequacy   and\r\n\r\nappropriateness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from some constituents is that the financial\r\n\r\nassistance  rendered  by  the  Government,  while  very  much\r\n\r\nappreciated,  is paltry at times and, in some instances,  not\r\n\r\ncommensurate with the stringent requirements imposed.   I  am\r\n\r\nnot  advocating  increased social  benefits  or  an  enhanced\r\n\r\nwelfare  system  per  se. Far from it,  as  I  wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nsupport the promotion of self-help and the dignity of work, a\r\n\r\npoint  which the Minister of State for Manpower expounded  so\r\n\r\npoetically yesterday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there will always be a group of people where no\r\n\r\namount  of  resolve on their part is enough.  They need  help\r\n\r\ndue to their circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite an example. A resident in my constituency\r\n\r\nis an able-bodied odd job labourer.  He is now unable to work\r\n\r\nas his wife is suffering from terminal liver cancer and he is\r\n\r\nlooking after her and their two sons who are still schooling.\r\n\r\nIt  is  this  class  of  people  that  we  must  continue  to\r\n\r\nacknowledge,  remember and render help appropriately.   As  a\r\n\r\nvolunteer worker recently remarked to me, \"While it is  right\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to promote self-reliance and the dignity\r\n\r\nof  work to avoid the development of a crutch mentality,  our\r\n\r\nmeans  test  must  also  not  be  so  stringent  that  it  is\r\n\r\nconsidered a mean test rather than a means test.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to mitigate the income divide would be to\r\n\r\nensure that ample avenues are given to all to maximise  their\r\n\r\npotential and level up.  Allowing the brightest and the  best\r\n\r\nto excel economically and the worst off to receive assistance\r\n\r\nwill address the top and the lowest echelons of society.  But\r\n\r\nthere is a growing number of those who are just \"getting  by\"\r\n\r\nbased  on  our  current  pragmatic  economic  definition   of\r\n\r\nsuccess.   These  people might be frustrated  by  the  income\r\n\r\nsqueeze and become envious of the successes of the heroes  of\r\n\r\ncapitalism.  Sir, a tangible way to address this issue  would\r\n\r\nbe to provide them with ample avenues to level up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in relation to this, I subscribe to\r\n\r\nthe  President's argument that the key means  to  uplift  the\r\n\r\npopulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  to redouble our emphasis on education and training.  With\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  cope  with the demands  of  the  new  economy,\r\n\r\nconstant restructuring and, therefore, higher obsolescence of\r\n\r\nexisting jobs, opportunities for lifelong learning should  be\r\n\r\ncreated  to cater to diverse groups of people. These  include\r\n\r\nthose  who need to prepare for a new area of employment,  are\r\n\r\nplanning  mid-career moves, are interested to return  to  the\r\n\r\nworkforce, particularly the women, are interested to  upgrade\r\n\r\ntheir   qualifications  or  are  just  purely   looking   for\r\n\r\nintellectual satisfaction.  The courses could be  offered  by\r\n\r\ntertiary   and   recognised  professional   institutions   in\r\n\r\ncooperation  with the industries.  They need not be  confined\r\n\r\nto  new growth industries but also staple old economy sectors\r\n\r\nwhich will continue to need employees, like teaching and even\r\n\r\nin the field of property management.  Such staple old economy\r\n\r\nsectors could hire mid-level middle-aged managers whose  jobs\r\n\r\nhave  been  made  obsolete by restructuring  or  the  changed\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over time, the provision of a wide variety of lifelong\r\n\r\nlearning  opportunities will help maintain a  highly  skilled\r\n\r\nand  knowledgeable labour force which is able to adapt to the\r\n\r\nchanging job market and adjust to economic restructuring  and\r\n\r\ndownturns,  such as what we have just experienced.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  am  pleased  to note  that  the  MOM,  with  the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of MOE, has mounted many schemes to promote  and\r\n\r\nencourage lifelong learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To allow more to benefit from these lifelong learning\r\n\r\nopportunities, subsidised fees could be considered  even  for\r\n\r\nhouswives preparing to return to work and low-income earners.\r\n\r\nMore Singaporeans, and not just the best and brightest, would\r\n\r\nbenefit from such lifelong educational opportunities.   Those\r\n\r\nwho  miss  the boat the first time can at least have  another\r\n\r\nchance  to  reach  their  desired destination,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nimportant since human capital is our most valuable asset.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my third point is the need to manage\r\n\r\nethnic  polarisation in our society.  This has always been  a\r\n\r\nthorny\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nissue  in  domestic politics.  One needs to bear in mind  the\r\n\r\ncontext  of race relations.  The reality, whether we like  it\r\n\r\nor  not, is this: Singapore as a Chinese dominated society in\r\n\r\na  region  comprising ethnic majorities.  There are sometimes\r\n\r\nunspoken  concerns  that centre on where  the  stronger  pull\r\n\r\nlies:   (1)  blood and kin and, increasingly, one's religious\r\n\r\nfaith; or (2) loyalty to one's country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the problems are compounded by the socio-economic distinctions that exist among ethnic groups that\r\n\r\nhave led to the, at one time, controversial formation of self-help  groups  like MENDAKI and SINDA.  These issues  are  not\r\n\r\nconfined to our Malay compatriots, although they have,  quite\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  borne the brunt of the most intense  scrutiny\r\n\r\nbecause of recent events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding all this, I do not forget that we\r\n\r\nhave  done  very  well indeed over the past  few  decades  in\r\n\r\nbuilding  racial harmony among the major ethnic  groups.   We\r\n\r\nneed   only  to  recall  the  major  strides  we  have  made.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, racial tensions are often resolved violently -  in\r\n\r\nIndia, the Balkan republics and in Africa.  We are blessed to\r\n\r\nhave  an enlightened leadership that lived through tumultuous\r\n\r\ntimes  in  our history and appreciates from bitter experience\r\n\r\nhow  racial  fault  lines  can ruin  everything  we  have  so\r\n\r\npainfully built up over the years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have racially integrated schools, racial limits\r\n\r\nin  public  housing  to  prevent the formation  of  enclaves,\r\n\r\nminority   representation  in  politics  through   GRCs   and\r\n\r\ncommunity-level  activities to bind people together,  in  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  our  pledge,  \"regardless  of  race,  language  or\r\n\r\nreligion\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as the President has put it in his Address, \"The\r\n\r\ntask  is  never complete.\"  The issue continues to  haunt  us\r\n\r\nafter  decades and continues to morph into new forms, whether\r\n\r\nit  be  madrasahs, tudung or something else.  If we  are  not\r\n\r\nvigilant, the cracks will widen and undo everything.  We must\r\n\r\nnever allow that to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhappen.   This is more important than ever before not  merely\r\n\r\ndue  to  recent  events  but also due  to  the  international\r\n\r\ntalents  we  are trying to attract who are also from  diverse\r\n\r\nethnic groups and religious persuasions.  Indeed, the concept\r\n\r\nof  a multi-racial, multi-religious society may be foreign to\r\n\r\nour  foreign  talent, some of whom hail from ethnically  more\r\n\r\nhomogeneous  societies.  The issue of social integration  and\r\n\r\ncohesion could take on an added dimension when the number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  talent in Singapore becomes significant.  Hence,  we\r\n\r\nmust never let up on efforts to foster greater cohesion among\r\n\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a nation, we should re-affirm multi-racialism as\r\n\r\na  creed,  as the only way forward.  Efforts continue  to  be\r\n\r\nmade  in  schools with the formation of the IRCCs and Harmony\r\n\r\nCircles at the community level.  I applaud such moves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us not forget the adults, especially those in\r\n\r\ntheir  early  20s and 30s, and the middle income  groups  who\r\n\r\ntend to participate less in grassroots activities.  Adulthood\r\n\r\nand,  sometimes,  affluence, rob us of  our  innocence.   How\r\n\r\noften,  as adults, do we sing the national anthem or say  the\r\n\r\npledge?  Sometimes, we grow sceptical of the civic lessons we\r\n\r\nlearn  in  school and need to relearn them.  I remember  some\r\n\r\nyears  ago, watching on TV a memorial service for the victims\r\n\r\nof  the  SilkAir MI185 crash.  The nation had already grieved\r\n\r\nfor  the victims and their families.  The service was a  grim\r\n\r\nreminder  to  the  rest of us who are not  victims  or  their\r\n\r\nfamily members.  While we will perhaps never fully understand\r\n\r\nthe   depth  of  pain  they  felt,  the  presence  of   other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   was   an   act  of  solidarity   with   fellow\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and fellow human beings.  It showed  that  other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans understand, care and, most of all, share in that\r\n\r\ngrief.   I  picture in my mind similar services the Americans\r\n\r\nheld   in  their  own  country  and  throughout  the   world,\r\n\r\ncommemorating the victims of the World Trade Centre collapse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a binding power to such \"rituals\". One needs\r\n\r\nto  think  only  of the National Day parades that  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears have taken on a rather nationalistic tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile  some  may be sceptical, many others I know,  including\r\n\r\nmiddle  income and successful professionals who have  watched\r\n\r\nthese  parades \"live\", often speak of how proud they felt  to\r\n\r\nbe Singaporeans.  Sir, when we stand side by side, hands held\r\n\r\nhigh with that of our neighbours, the colour of our skin, the\r\n\r\nlanguage  we  speak at home, the type of cars we  drive,  the\r\n\r\nhouses  we  live in, the country clubs we belong to  and  the\r\n\r\nthings  we  do  on Friday or Sunday, do not  seem  to  matter\r\n\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest that we could have much\r\n\r\nmore  of  such national events - to re-enact our history,  to\r\n\r\ncelebrate our shared destiny - to instill this sense  of  our\r\n\r\ncommon  humanity  and,  more importantly,  our  \"Singaporean-ness\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are those who think such activities are\r\n\r\npropaganda,  let them be.  We must think of ways of  bringing\r\n\r\nsuch  events to reach adults in their communities, homes  and\r\n\r\nworkplaces.   Perhaps,  we  need to  form  a  National  Unity\r\n\r\nCommittee to coordinate all efforts to this end.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I echo the words of the President that \"we must\r\n\r\nmove  beyond mere tolerance, in order to enhance appreciation\r\n\r\nand  build  confidence  among  the  different  groups.\"   The\r\n\r\nnational  events  I  propose should,  hopefully,  \"widen  the\r\n\r\ncommon ground that all Singaporeans share\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have dwelt at some length on these three critical\r\n\r\nstress  points, which could become more acute over  the  next\r\n\r\nfew  years  as  Singapore operates in a changed  environment.\r\n\r\nThese  stress  points,  in addition to  others,  need  to  be\r\n\r\nmanaged  so that they do not fester and affect our political,\r\n\r\neconomic  and social health.  A little stress helps  to  keep\r\n\r\nthe adrenaline pumping and thus sharpen our competitive edge,\r\n\r\nbut  too  much stress could pose serious health  hazards  for\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the world today is not the same as before. It has\r\n\r\nbecome  competitive, complicated and even controversial.   We\r\n\r\nneed to adjust and innovate in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress  and  advance.  While we want to narrow  the  divide\r\n\r\nbetween  the poor and the rich, we also want Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nbe  self-reliant and independent.  While we want to  be  more\r\n\r\nopen  and  allow opportunities for dialogue and consultation,\r\n\r\nwe  also  want  to  ensure constructive and  useful  debates.\r\n\r\nWhile   we   want  to  provide  more  space  for   individual\r\n\r\ncommunities  to  grow, we also want to  build  consensus  and\r\n\r\ncommon  grounds.   These are some of the S21  dilemmas  which\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  challenge each generation afresh.  Nonetheless,\r\n\r\nSir, the healthy constitution we have built, in terms of  our\r\n\r\nsocial, economic and political capital, should serve us  well\r\n\r\nin  these  turbulent  times.  I am  sure  with  consultation,\r\n\r\ncooperation  and  commitment, we can overcome  the  obstacles\r\n\r\nahead and advance as a nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore unequivocally support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  rise to support the Motion of Thanks moved by Mrs Lim Hwee\r\n\r\nHua, Member for Marine Parade GRC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past months since the election in November 2001,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  have been informed, persuaded and  warned  many\r\n\r\ntimes  over of the challenges and difficulties that Singapore\r\n\r\nis  facing  and will continue to face in the New Economy  and\r\n\r\nthe  ever-changing political and security  landscape  of  the\r\n\r\nworld.   In his Speech, the President has again reminded  us,\r\n\r\n\"Our  region  has  been  fundamentally altered  and  security\r\n\r\nproblems that arise in the region will inevitably spill  over\r\n\r\nto  Singapore.\"  With this as the backdrop, let  us  remember\r\n\r\nthat  during the election we have given the people some  hope\r\n\r\nfor  jobs,  jobs and jobs, and they have shown their  support\r\n\r\nfor the PAP Government via the ballot boxes.  Similarly, this\r\n\r\nsupport  was earlier translated in their unequivocal  support\r\n\r\nfor  the cost-cutting measures introduced to ensure Singapore\r\n\r\nremains competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the burst of the Internet bubble, gone are the\r\n\r\ndays when everybody wants to be associated with \"e\" something\r\n\r\nbut,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow,  the buzzwords of the day must begin with \"re\":  remake,\r\n\r\nreinvent, review and restructure.  I sincerely hope  that  we\r\n\r\ndo not get carried away by these fanciful words but, instead,\r\n\r\nclearly  understand the reasons and implications of  each  of\r\n\r\nthem to our country and, especially, to the citizens that  we\r\n\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President has outlined the key challenges and how we\r\n\r\ncan  respond to cope with these challenges.  This is so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can continue to strive and prosper if the environment  is\r\n\r\nright.  These challenges are real and we must face them head-on.\r\n\r\nSir, there are clear indicators that there is malaise in  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  I do not claim to be an economic expert but, on the\r\n\r\nground, we can observe more requests for financial assistance\r\n\r\narising  from  bankruptcy, business failures,  retrenchments,\r\n\r\njob  losses and reduction in sales revenue.  It is  well  and\r\n\r\ngood  to  say things like \"remake\" and \"reinvent\"  Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut what does it all mean for the man-in-the-street?  Let  us\r\n\r\nnot  be  detached from the people.  Singaporeans are worried,\r\n\r\nand  their concerns are basic bread-and-kaya issues.   I  can\r\n\r\nassure  you, Sir, that many out there still do not understand\r\n\r\nthe  rationale for such drastic moves that have  resulted  in\r\n\r\nthe  loss of jobs for many Singaporeans.  I believe that  one\r\n\r\nmost important challenge for the Government is to ensure that\r\n\r\nthe  masses  are  with  us, they must understand  that  these\r\n\r\nchanges are necessary and that we have to do it no matter how\r\n\r\npainful it is going to be.  It is just like bursting a pimple\r\n\r\non  our face.  The troublesome pimple becomes a red dot,  but\r\n\r\nthe red dot will soon heal to reveal healthy new skin.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is the recent major development in the\r\n\r\nfinancial  sector that has resulted in the merger of  several\r\n\r\nbanks  and the introduction of new competition for our  local\r\n\r\nbanks.  Many people do not understand the rationale of such a\r\n\r\ndrastic  move and has resulted in the loss of jobs  for  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.   These  retrenched  workers  are  key   family\r\n\r\nmembers  and  many are sole breadwinners with many  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments.  Just this year, Sir, I had a resident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho came to see me during my meet-the-people session.  He was\r\n\r\nworking for a local bank for seven years and he was earning a\r\n\r\ndecent salary, a father of three, in the prime of his life, a\r\n\r\ntypical  Singaporean  with the usual  four  Cs  to  maintain.\r\n\r\nAlmost overnight, he became jobless.  He could not find a job\r\n\r\nfor  several months and his savings are fast depleting.   How\r\n\r\nis he going to feed his wife and three children?  It takes  a\r\n\r\nlot  of courage and humility for someone like him to ask  for\r\n\r\nhelp  but  he was at his wits' end and in despair.  There  is\r\n\r\nonly  so much that we can do to help him.  He is just one  of\r\n\r\nmany  such cases.  I am afraid, Sir, we may be creating  many\r\n\r\ndisgruntled  citizens who will be bitter, cynical  and  anti-establishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the Government and its agencies must, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  take the lead in changing and adapting a  different\r\n\r\nstyle  of governance for the new Singapore.  It must  not  be\r\n\r\nseen  as  always giving directions and taking a paternalistic\r\n\r\nrole but rather, it must be a partner of the people.  We  can\r\n\r\ntell the people to change their mindset but is the Government\r\n\r\nwilling  to  do  the same in its way of doing things?   There\r\n\r\nmust be clear indicators and not just lip service in the  way\r\n\r\nour key institutions run their business.  They are well-known\r\n\r\nfor  their  efficiency and high standards.  It is  time  that\r\n\r\nthey  showed the same high level of compassion and  humanity.\r\n\r\nIf  not,  cynical remarks and views about the Government  not\r\n\r\nbeing sincere will continue to persist and the able will  not\r\n\r\ncome forward to take part in this process of change.  Let  us\r\n\r\nwork  together to change this negative thinking  and  get  as\r\n\r\nmany able and willing citizens to participate in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's willingness to change its mindset will\r\n\r\nbe  a  bold  effort  but nevertheless, a necessary  one.   We\r\n\r\ncannot  afford  to  have our strong and able  simply  sit  by\r\n\r\nsipping   their  expensive  cafe  latte  at  Starbucks,   not\r\n\r\nparticipating,  just  watching.   This  effort  in  our  long\r\n\r\njourney  of  nation-building is essential and  all  concerned\r\n\r\nmembers of our homeland should be part of it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we ponder upon the means and ways to\r\n\r\nmake these changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  adapt, there are several fundamental issues that I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  we  could revisit.  The first is our workers'  welfare.\r\n\r\nOur  workers are constantly grappling with rapid changes  and\r\n\r\nthe  need  to  acquire  new skills and knowledge.   Many  are\r\n\r\nstruggling and some are resisting the change.  How  then  can\r\n\r\nwe  assist them to manage the change?  I have to commend  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Manpower, NTUC and the CDCs for their efforts but\r\n\r\nmore  can be done to make these changes less painful and more\r\n\r\nmeaningful for these workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The burden of change should not just fall on the\r\n\r\nemployees  but employers should also ensure that workers  are\r\n\r\nregularly upgraded and retrained even during the good  times.\r\n\r\nEmployers  should  consciously  make  provisions  for   their\r\n\r\nemployees  to  upgrade  and pick  up  new  skills.   In  this\r\n\r\nrespect,  I  would like to cite the examples of  SingTel  and\r\n\r\nMindef  for  their effort to upgrade their staff through  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme and the  Specialist  Manpower\r\n\r\nProgramme.   If at any time, the staff of these organisations\r\n\r\nwere  to  leave  for one reason or another, they  would  have\r\n\r\nobtained  qualifications or special skills that  would  boost\r\n\r\ntheir employability.  The willingness and experience of these\r\n\r\norganisations should be publicised so that more companies can\r\n\r\npick  up these good corporate practices and be good corporate\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to highlight the importance of\r\n\r\neducation in this process of change.  From the feedback  from\r\n\r\nmy  residents  and grassroots leaders, I have concluded  that\r\n\r\nmany  parents  are  very  concerned  about  their  children's\r\n\r\nfuture.   As  a parent myself, we worry whether our  children\r\n\r\ncan  cope  with  the extremely competitive education  system.\r\n\r\nYes, we parents are more kiasu than our children.  We are  so\r\n\r\nafraid of our children not having enough to the point that we\r\n\r\nappear kiasi.  Some cynics may say otherwise but the majority\r\n\r\ndoes  agree  that  we  do  have a good  education  system  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I believe that we can still fine-tune it to  make\r\n\r\nit  even  better.   The education system should  prepare  the\r\n\r\nfuture  generations for the rapid changes and produce nimble,\r\n\r\ncreative and innovative minds.  We know\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  importance that the Government puts in education by  the\r\n\r\nsheer   size  of  resources  that  have  been  brought   into\r\n\r\neducation.  This cannot be denied.  We cannot afford  not  to\r\n\r\ninvest in our people.  As we move into the knowledge economy,\r\n\r\nwe  need  to  have  more knowledge workers  that  are  multi-disciplined and can handle multi tasks at the same time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we should have a more holistic approach\r\n\r\ntowards  education.  Academic excellence should  not  be  the\r\n\r\nonly  thrust  for education.  A child should be  nurtured  on\r\n\r\nvalues  such as national education, community spirit,  social\r\n\r\nservices,  volunteerism and sports.  These  would  nurture  a\r\n\r\nwell-rounded   individual   with   strong   community   ties.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Sir, our education system should aim  to  develop\r\n\r\ncitizens  who are able to put Singapore and community  before\r\n\r\nself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to the Ministry of Education to\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  bringing the early  childhood  education\r\n\r\ninto the formal education system - put it directly under  the\r\n\r\npurview  of  MOE.  This portion of our education  system  has\r\n\r\nmostly  been left to the community organisations and  to  the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  Is this wise?  As the pressure for economic\r\n\r\nexcellence  continues, we will see more dual  income  earning\r\n\r\nfamilies.   There are several developed countries  that  have\r\n\r\nincorporated  the  pre-school  education  into  the   primary\r\n\r\neducation.  For example, France, where there is a high number\r\n\r\nof  working parents, the system takes in children from  three\r\n\r\nto   five   years  old  in  the  ecole  maternelle   or   the\r\n\r\nkindergarten.  Very often, these pre-schools are part of  the\r\n\r\nprimary  schools.   The  Compulsory Education  Act  that  was\r\n\r\npassed   in   Parliament  is  a  clear  indication   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  commitment to educating our future generations.\r\n\r\nThis augurs well for us.  Let us take this a step further and\r\n\r\nincorporate   the  foundation  years  into   the   mainstream\r\n\r\neducation provided by MOE.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of such a move are plenty and I would\r\n\r\nname a few.  The dual income families need the support of the\r\n\r\nState so that both parents can contribute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  economy.  The Ministry of Education can  ensure  the\r\n\r\nquality  and  standards of the early childhood education  and\r\n\r\nthe   kindergartens.    This  is  to  ensure  that  a  strong\r\n\r\nfoundation  is  in  place  when  they  continue  to   primary\r\n\r\neducation.   The  Ministry  of Education  has  an  impeccable\r\n\r\nrecord, locally and internationally, and I see no reason  why\r\n\r\nwe cannot do the same for early childhood education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to touch on education focused\r\n\r\nfor  the Malay community.  Sir, the Malay community has  made\r\n\r\ntremendous progress in the area of education over the past 10\r\n\r\nyears.  Prime Minister Goh highlighted this last year.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  we have made inroads in many non-traditional fields.\r\n\r\nMore  Malay  professionals are holding key positions  in  the\r\n\r\nprivate and public sectors.  This is possible because of  our\r\n\r\nsystem of meritocracy.  However, there is a need to translate\r\n\r\nthe  culture  of academic excellence seen in the Chinese  and\r\n\r\nIndian  communities into the Malay community.  The  community\r\n\r\nmust  understand  that it should not aim for average  results\r\n\r\nand  mediocrity.   We must aim to achieve high  standards  in\r\n\r\neducation  and attain world-class recognition in whatever  we\r\n\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is a great social leveller. Through\r\n\r\neducation,  the  community  will  be  able  to  stand   tall,\r\n\r\nparticipate and be part of the mainstream.  In this  respect,\r\n\r\nI strongly encourage more involvement of the community at the\r\n\r\nnational  level.   The Malay community should  be  more  pro-active   in   reaching  out  and  bonding  with   the   other\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,   for  example,  by  involving  themselves   in\r\n\r\nassociations  or  clubs, like the Rotary  Club,  Toastmasters\r\n\r\nClub, alumni associations and other secular associations like\r\n\r\nthe  community  clubs.   In doing so,  we  will  create  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for interaction and understanding.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude, Sir, by saying that I do not profess to\r\n\r\nhave all the solutions - far from that, but I hope to be able\r\n\r\nto contribute positively to the democratic process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in his Address, the President\r\n\r\nsaid  that  we  must  build  first-class  infrastructure  and\r\n\r\nprovide  services at competitive price.  The Government  must\r\n\r\ntry to control the cost of doing business in Singapore if  it\r\n\r\nwants  the  businesses to succeed.  It is said that Singapore\r\n\r\nis a country where the business cost is high, such as rental,\r\n\r\nlabour, transport and other Government levies.  In the  past,\r\n\r\nwhen  our neighbouring countries were relatively backward  as\r\n\r\ncompared  to  us, despite our higher business  cost  we  were\r\n\r\nstill able to attract some investments here, because of other\r\n\r\nadvantages  we had.  However, the neighbouring countries  are\r\n\r\nnow  catching up on us and are able to do what we  have  been\r\n\r\ndoing.  They are now attracting foreign investors because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  lower  business  cost, and  have  become  our  serious\r\n\r\ncompetitors.   This  happens not only in  the  new  areas  of\r\n\r\ninvestments,  but in areas which used to be our  strongholds.\r\n\r\nMany  established  companies  have  been  relocated  to   our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries, and this is not confined to the multi-national  companies only. Even our very own small and  medium\r\n\r\nenterprises are relocating there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, we are still able to attract some high-tech\r\n\r\nindustries  to  invest  here,  it  has  brought  about   some\r\n\r\nstructural  unemployment in our labour market.  Although  the\r\n\r\nstrong push for retraining and re-skilling has helped in some\r\n\r\nway  to solve the unemployment problem, there are still  some\r\n\r\nproblems,  particularly  with  the  older  workers  who  have\r\n\r\ndifficulty coping with the new technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore economy is made up of many types of\r\n\r\nenterprises.   Some are very strong and some are  small,  and\r\n\r\nthe  majority  are SMEs.  To them, the profit margin  depends\r\n\r\nvery  much  on the operating cost.  Whether they can  survive\r\n\r\nwill have serious impact on unemployment in future.  All  the\r\n\r\nhigh-tech  farms  in  Sungei Tengah, the  wood  factories  in\r\n\r\nSungei  Kadut  and  the  scores of  department  stores  along\r\n\r\nOrchard Road are sensitive to the cost of business.  There is\r\n\r\nno  necessity for us to force the cost sensitive business  to\r\n\r\nrelocate.   For  certain reasons, we need to retain  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  companies.   In  order to reduce  the  cost  of  their\r\n\r\nbusiness, we must think of ways and means to help  them.   At\r\n\r\nthis juncture, while we are hoping to get out of the woods of\r\n\r\nrecession,   we  should  think  of  ways  to   retain   these\r\n\r\nenterprises  to  save  jobs for our  workers,  otherwise  our\r\n\r\nrecovery will be slower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of sea and air transport, there is over\r\n\r\ncapacity  in the region, and the competition from within  the\r\n\r\nregion  has  intensified, for example, the case of  Evergreen\r\n\r\nShipping Company.  Even if our profit is less by $20  million\r\n\r\nper  year,  we  should  try to keep  the  patronage  of  this\r\n\r\nshipping company.  We have to try to reduce our cost, enhance\r\n\r\nour  quality of service in order to keep Singapore as an  air\r\n\r\nand shipping hub of this region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are some of the complaints about the high\r\n\r\ncost of business operation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rental cost. We often hear complaints from the\r\n\r\nbusinessmen that the rental cost here is very high.   In  our\r\n\r\npublic  tender system, we inevitably pick the highest bid  as\r\n\r\nthe  successful bid.  The fact is this successful tender does\r\n\r\nnot  necessarily reflect the true market value of  rental  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  shows only the mentality of  the  successful\r\n\r\ntenderers.  Some may tender at excessively high price out  of\r\n\r\ndesperation, or they use the premises to engage in  lucrative\r\n\r\nside-line  business, such as the collection of  Toto  or  4-D\r\n\r\nlotteries.   Under  such  circumstances,  if  you  take   the\r\n\r\nsuccessful tender price as a reflection of the market  price,\r\n\r\nthen you are wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport costs. In Singapore, our cars are among the\r\n\r\nmost  expensive ones in the world. The prices of  petrol  and\r\n\r\ndiesel are controlled by the five big oil companies operating\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Their  high profit margins  jacked  up  fuel\r\n\r\nprices  and  added on to our transport cost,  and  hence  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  cost.   The Government has the obligation  to  help\r\n\r\nbring  down  fuel  prices in order  to  reduce  the  cost  of\r\n\r\ntransport to the businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utilities charges. High utility charge is the most\r\n\r\ncommon complaint.  Just a few years ago, the water tariff was\r\n\r\njust  55  cents per cubic metre.  Today, it has  gone  up  to\r\n\r\n$1.10  per cubic metre. With an additional tax of 40%,  water\r\n\r\nnow  costs  $1.55 per cubic metre.  In other words,  for  the\r\n\r\npast  few years, our water price has increased by some  300%.\r\n\r\nThis has aroused the wrath of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate tax. The Finance Minister has reduced\r\n\r\ncorporate  income tax  and shifted some taxation to  indirect\r\n\r\ntaxes.   Some companies have many subsidiary companies,  some\r\n\r\nprofitable and some heavily in the red.  All these companies'\r\n\r\nlosses  or  gains cannot be set off.  Our income  tax  system\r\n\r\ndoes  not allow the main company to offset the losses of  the\r\n\r\nlosing  companies  with  the high profits  of  the  lucrative\r\n\r\ncompanies.  As a result, the effective tax rate of the  group\r\n\r\nis not the stipulated 28% but is effectively some 70% to 80%.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  I hope the Inland Revenue Authority would  review\r\n\r\nthe system to see how the effective tax rate could be reduced\r\n\r\nto help the group of companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from income tax, there are also some other taxes,\r\n\r\nsuch  as property tax, which are a burden to the businessmen.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of a warehouse, whether it is vacant\r\n\r\nor  occupied, the owner has to pay property tax on it.   This\r\n\r\nis another burden on the businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Government regulations are made in such a way that\r\n\r\ncauses  an increase in business cost. For example, in certain\r\n\r\nwork  sites, the rules stipulate that there must be at  least\r\n\r\none resident engineer and a safety officer to look after\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  work.  In order to avoid running into trouble  with  the\r\n\r\nrules and the civil servants behind them, the developers have\r\n\r\nto  employ  more  people.   For  example,  some  workers  are\r\n\r\nemployed just to make sure the mosquitoes do not fly into the\r\n\r\nworksite  and start breeding there. Therefore, we should  not\r\n\r\nhave  so  many of these rules and regulations which  tend  to\r\n\r\nincrease the cost to the businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of the Environment's Addendum, it states\r\n\r\nthat  we  will endeavour to tap all sources of water  supply.\r\n\r\nAt present, although water supply is assured in the two water\r\n\r\nagreements  with  Malaysia,  the  first  agreement  will   be\r\n\r\nexpiring  in 2016.  By then, whether the Malaysian Government\r\n\r\nwill  continue to supply enough water to us at  a  reasonable\r\n\r\nprice  is an uncertainty.  Although there are still  some  14\r\n\r\nyears  from now till 2016, we should take proactive  measures\r\n\r\nto tap new sources of water, and to develop new technology in\r\n\r\nthe  generation of potable water. Otherwise  we  will  be  in\r\n\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking at the possibility of developing\r\n\r\ntechnology  in the production of NEWater and the desalination\r\n\r\ntechnology.   The potential for NEWater is very great.   This\r\n\r\nis  because  the cost of NEWater is cheap and  is  very  much\r\n\r\nlower  than that of desalination.  If there is a demand,  and\r\n\r\nthe  price  is attractive, we should produce this NEWater  as\r\n\r\nmuch as possible.  We could even turn Singapore into a centre\r\n\r\nfor  NEWater  technology  and water recycling  industry.   By\r\n\r\n2016,  we do not depend on Malaysia to supply us with  enough\r\n\r\ndrinking  water, we should have enough water in  meeting  our\r\n\r\nneeds.   Although  the manufacture of NEWater  is  relatively\r\n\r\ncheap,  it  would take some efforts to change the mindset  of\r\n\r\nthe  people into accepting NEWater as an alternative  of  the\r\n\r\ntraditional water from mother nature.  There will be a  limit\r\n\r\nto  the  NEWater production volume because it depends on  the\r\n\r\nvolume of available waste water.  Therefore, we have to  look\r\n\r\nat  the overall picture of the water supply.  We have to make\r\n\r\nuse  of seawater desalination to supplement the water supply.\r\n\r\nSo we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstill  need to develop the technology in desalination and  we\r\n\r\nshould be prepared within the next 10 years to cope with  the\r\n\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make a breakthrough in water technology, we\r\n\r\nshould not depend on the Ministry of the Environment and  the\r\n\r\nPublic  Works  Department  alone.  We  should  allow  private\r\n\r\nenterprises  to take part in this industry, so  that  in  the\r\n\r\nnext  10  years some private enterprises which specialise  in\r\n\r\nthe   NEWater  technology  will  emerge.   They  will   mould\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  be  a  centre for the NEWater  technology  and\r\n\r\nexport their services and products to the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, if we depend upon high-price technology for\r\n\r\nour  water, we have to decide whether we have to  give  up  a\r\n\r\nsingle  water source strategy.  We have to look  at  the  two\r\n\r\ntypes  of  water   - one is potable and the  other  one  non-drinkable.   We may have to prepare for these  two  types  of\r\n\r\nwater.   Maybe  we have to include the piping system  in  our\r\n\r\nbuildings so that the two types of water could be supplied to\r\n\r\nevery   household.    HDB  and  the  Ministry   of   National\r\n\r\nDevelopment may want to take a good look at this issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Address, the President urged the people to be\r\n\r\nmore  inquiring and more creative.  We all agree  with  this.\r\n\r\nThe question is how are we going to encourage young people to\r\n\r\nbe curious, to be more adventurous and more enterprising.  We\r\n\r\nshould  give  them  more space and time.   This  is  a  basic\r\n\r\ncondition.  According to my experience at the university, the\r\n\r\nstandard of thesis submitted by the graduates in the past was\r\n\r\nvery  high.  However, the university adopted the two-semester\r\n\r\nsystem, instead of having one examination in a year, we  have\r\n\r\ntwo examinations now.  So students are too busy preparing for\r\n\r\nthe  examinations, and they do not have much time  for  their\r\n\r\nthesis.  Therefore, the quality of the thesis now is inferior\r\n\r\nto  what it used to be. This explains the fact that the  will\r\n\r\nto  gain knowledge and to be inquisitive is much affected  by\r\n\r\nthe time available in the university.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at what the Ministry of Education had done in\r\n\r\nthe past, there is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  tendency  to phase out the 'O' level examination  and  cut\r\n\r\ncontact  hours  for  classes.   I  think  this  is  a   great\r\n\r\nimprovement, but not everything is perfect.  For example,  by\r\n\r\n2003, to gain admission to the university, in addition to the\r\n\r\ntraditional  'A' level results, the candidates have  also  to\r\n\r\nproduce  their SAT results as well as a special project.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way,  it  will be a great burden on our Junior  College\r\n\r\nstudents.   We  can  either depend on SAT or  our  `A'  level\r\n\r\nexamination  results for university entrance requirement,  or\r\n\r\ndepend  on  the special project.  But now, we are asking  for\r\n\r\nall  these  three requirements together!  As  a  result,  our\r\n\r\nstudents suffer.  Our students are under great pressure.  How\r\n\r\nare they going to have time to be inquisitive and creative?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address also touched on allowing people\r\n\r\nmore  opportunities to develop the hidden potential  of  some\r\n\r\nstudents.   The  secondary school and the JC  will  have  new\r\n\r\ncurriculum to develop the hidden talent of students in  areas\r\n\r\nlike music and art.  However, in an article in Lianhe Zaobao,\r\n\r\nthe writer wrote about a friend's child who was very good  in\r\n\r\nChinese, and had aspired to be a Chinese scholar. However, he\r\n\r\nfailed his English paper in the `O' level examination.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  he  could not fulfil his dream of joining  a  junior\r\n\r\ncollege with the view of going on to study Chinese Literature\r\n\r\nin  the  university.  He  could only gain  admission  to  the\r\n\r\npolytechnic  or even the ITE.  This student was  deprived  of\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity to make use of his proficiency  in  Chinese,\r\n\r\nand Singapore lost one rare talent in Chinese.  No doubt,  we\r\n\r\ncan  import some Chinese scholars from China to replace  this\r\n\r\nlost  gem, but what if their English is even worse than  this\r\n\r\nlocal student?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this example, it would appear that the bureaucratic\r\n\r\nrules  do not give room for each case to be assessed  on  its\r\n\r\nown  merit.   A student who excels in Chinese and aspires  to\r\n\r\nmajor  in  Chinese is denied admission to the junior  college\r\n\r\nsimply  because he fails his English.  Can we not  have  some\r\n\r\ndiscretion  so that the specific student could be  given  the\r\n\r\nopportunity to develop his or her talent and potential to the\r\n\r\nfullest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for Transport and Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr Khaw Boon Wan): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks to the\r\n\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Leaving Comfort Zone</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's call for the remaking of Singapore\r\n\r\nprompted  me  to  talk about why I moved out  of  the  Public\r\n\r\nGallery,  from where I had observed the debate in  Parliament\r\n\r\nfor many years.  I was very comfortable there.  I could serve\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Singaporeans.  So why did I leave the  comfort\r\n\r\nzone?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Leaving Starvation</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I visited my father's hometown in China for\r\n\r\nthe  first  time; a small hilly village somewhere in  Fujian.\r\n\r\nConditions  there  were harsh.  But my relatives  there  were\r\n\r\nproud to observe that it was much better than even, say, five\r\n\r\nyears ago.  So I could imagine how it must have been like  70\r\n\r\nyears ago.  No wonder my father had to leave his hometown and\r\n\r\nrisk his life, sailing into the seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Simple Dream: Stark Choices</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left his hometown because there was not enough food\r\n\r\nto  go  around.  His choices were stark: emigrate or  starve.\r\n\r\nEconomic  mismanagement  and political  chaos  made  economic\r\n\r\nrefugees  of his generation.  Arriving penniless  in  Penang,\r\n\r\nhis expectations were low, aspirations were basic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dream was a simple one: so that his family would not\r\n\r\nhave to starve.  What he valued most were political stability\r\n\r\nand strong economic growth.  Day and night, he toiled so that\r\n\r\nwe  would  have  food on the table, a good  education  and  a\r\n\r\nladder out of poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Dream: Fair Play</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father had more than fulfilled his dream. As a\r\n\r\nresult,  I  was  never  deprived.  I  was  certainly  not  an\r\n\r\neconomic refugee.  So why did I end up here in Singapore?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in school, some of us were deeply attracted\r\n\r\nto  the  value  of  meritocracy  advanced  by  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nleaders.   Our  dream  was to fulfil the  equivalent  of  the\r\n\r\n\"Singapore  Dream\": to achieve our potential,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace, language or religion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After HSC, or the equivalent of the GCE 'A' Level, I\r\n\r\napplied  to  both  governments  for  a  scholarship.   I  was\r\n\r\naccepted by Singapore.  Meritocracy is a powerful idea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Singapore Cause</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has succeeded because we have embraced certain\r\n\r\nvalues:  meritocracy,  fair play, equal opportunities,  clean\r\n\r\ngovernment, racial and religious tolerance.  As a result,  we\r\n\r\nhave acquired certain core strengths.  First, our ability  to\r\n\r\nstay  cohesive over time and across racial, income and union-management  boundaries.  Second, our ability to preserve  our\r\n\r\ncore, yet we can also make changes when the situation demands\r\n\r\nit.   So  while we are not a perfect society, we  acknowledge\r\n\r\nthat;  we  keep improving.  That these have been  fundamental\r\n\r\ntenets of our nation for the last 40 years does not mean that\r\n\r\nthey  are  permanent.  If we do not all chip in  to  actively\r\n\r\npreserve  and advance the Singapore Cause, these core  values\r\n\r\nmay dissipate with the passing of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Singapore Dream was initially a personal one - secure\r\n\r\na  good  life for my family.  But as I got involved in public\r\n\r\npolicies  and shaping the future, my Singapore Dream  evolved\r\n\r\ninto  the  Singapore Cause.  My own experience is that  going\r\n\r\nbeyond  the  personal  to dreaming for  the  community  -  to\r\n\r\nachieve  our  potential as one community  -  that  is  deeply\r\n\r\nfulfilling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Global Dream</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Dream of my generation was to make it good\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  But I think the Singapore Dream of the  young\r\n\r\ngeneration is already quite different.  Their Singapore Dream\r\n\r\nis  probably  to  make it good in New York,  London,  Silicon\r\n\r\nValley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor  Shanghai, and to fly home occasionally for char kway teow\r\n\r\nor roti prata.  The Global Dream is today's reality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Singapore Dream is actually a Global Dream, how\r\n\r\ndo  you  ensure that Singaporeans remain rooted to Singapore?\r\n\r\nWill they call Singapore home and advance the Singapore Cause\r\n\r\nas  their  Singapore  Dream?  Or will they  simply  leave  to\r\n\r\npursue their personal Global Dream?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic dynamism is a key prerequisite to root\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to Singapore.  But it is no longer  sufficient.\r\n\r\nFor  the  able, they can move to and succeed in wherever  the\r\n\r\neconomic  opportunities are.  Even char  kway  teow  or  roti\r\n\r\nprata  is no longer sufficient as glue; you can now get  them\r\n\r\nin   Shanghai,  Sydney  or  London  in  food  courts  run  by\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after all, we have been encouraging the Global\r\n\r\nDream, as it is important for Singapore.  Hence, we push  our\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  venture abroad.  We peg  ourselves  to  global\r\n\r\nstandards.   This is also why we invest so much in education.\r\n\r\nSo many Singaporean students subsequently go on to top US Ivy\r\n\r\nLeague  Universities.  Do you know that in recent years,  our\r\n\r\nvery  own Raffles Junior College has consistently been  among\r\n\r\nthe  largest  single sources of undergraduate  admissions  to\r\n\r\nStanford  University?  I am told that in the  year  2000,  it\r\n\r\neven  beat Palo Alto High School to become the largest single\r\n\r\nsource of admissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without pursuing Global Dream, we cannot succeed as an\r\n\r\neconomy.   But  it is critical for Singaporeans  to  remember\r\n\r\nthat  without a Singapore Cause, there can be no Global Dream\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Involvement: Making A Difference</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a strange way, in meritocratic Singapore, some of our\r\n\r\nable  feel  that  there  is  no  room  for  them  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndifference.  With a competent Government worrying  about  the\r\n\r\nfuture  and  coming out with all the solutions, some  of  the\r\n\r\nable feel left out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in public service, so I was involved and could\r\n\r\nmake a difference in shaping the future.  But must one be  in\r\n\r\npublic service to make a difference?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Singapore society to be robust, we need good\r\n\r\nleaders in all the three sectors: public, private and  people\r\n\r\nsectors.  We have done very well in the last 40 years, with a\r\n\r\nfew  outstanding  leaders, especially in the  public  sector.\r\n\r\nBut in the next phase of our development, we need everyone to\r\n\r\nplay  a  role, and in each of the three sectors.  The  public\r\n\r\nsector  does not need to lead, nor has it the right expertise\r\n\r\nand instincts in all private and people sector issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector, we need to go beyond GLCs and\r\n\r\nMNCs.   Our  SMEs  must play and can play a  bigger  role  in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the public sector, key issues, such as defence, will\r\n\r\nhave to be led by the Government.  But there are others where\r\n\r\nthe  Government can now take a supporting role to  allow  the\r\n\r\npeople  sector  to  take  a lead.  For  example,  the  Nature\r\n\r\nSociety  has taken a lead on nature preservation matters.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve the public sector has benefited from their advice and\r\n\r\nexpertise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be more areas where the Government can\r\n\r\ndevolve to the people sector, to let the community decide for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  But let us not go for quick fixes.  As  a  young\r\n\r\nnation,  shared  vision and mode of participation  will  need\r\n\r\ntime  to  evolve.  We need to move at a pace that  meets  the\r\n\r\nexpectation of the young, while balancing domestic  concerns.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  seek  is not diversity for its own  sake,  but  the\r\n\r\nability  to  integrate such diversity  in  a  meaningful  and\r\n\r\nuseful way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do this very well in our schools. As a student, I\r\n\r\nremember  there  were so many activities I could  get  myself\r\n\r\ninvolved in, beyond the textbooks.  I remember helping to set\r\n\r\nup  the  Red  Cross  Society in my school.   I  ran  remedial\r\n\r\nclasses.   My classmates organised sports training  sessions.\r\n\r\nTogether,   we   initiated  and  took  part  in  inter-school\r\n\r\ncompetitions.  These activities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt  strong bonds amongst the students.  They made us  feel\r\n\r\nproud  of  our  school,  our heritage.   Thirty  years  after\r\n\r\nleaving  school,  we  still meet three, four  times  a  year,\r\n\r\nsharing  old  jokes,  but  also  always  spending  some  time\r\n\r\nthinking  about  what we can do to help  the  school  in  its\r\n\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experiences were in a Penang school. But from my\r\n\r\nchildren  and colleagues, I gather that their experiences  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  schools are similar.  But there is an  unfortunate\r\n\r\nbreak in such active participation in the community, when one\r\n\r\nenters adult life.  We should remedy this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of spontaneous participation, to connect with\r\n\r\none another, should continue into adulthood.  I hope everyone\r\n\r\ncan  come  forward  to make things better in  our  community,\r\n\r\nwhether in VWOs, in NGOs, or whatever.  If you are passionate\r\n\r\nabout  education, come and help in the schools.  If you  care\r\n\r\nabout  helping the elderly sick, come and help in the nursing\r\n\r\nhomes.   Business people and professionals from other  fields\r\n\r\ncan often bring new perspectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many Singaporeans do. I just came across the\r\n\r\nCentre  for  Fathering, not that I need  any  help.   It  was\r\n\r\nstarted  by  three fathers, to promote responsible fatherhood\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Two of them, at the initial stage,  actually\r\n\r\ngave  up their jobs, so that they can push their cause  which\r\n\r\nthey are passionate about whole-heartedly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretary Lim Soo Hoon told me that just last\r\n\r\nweek,  at  a  low  key, no publicity function  to  thank  the\r\n\r\nvolunteers at the Pelangi Home for the destitutes,  Jack  Neo\r\n\r\nturned up to entertain and encourage the volunteers, even  as\r\n\r\nhe was rushing off to catch a flight out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Permanent Secretary Yong Ying-I told me about Helen\r\n\r\nChia,  a  Volunteer Probation Officer who gave generously  of\r\n\r\nher  time helping the delinquents, besides giving tuition  in\r\n\r\nan RC to children who cannot afford private tuition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack Sim is another example. Driven by his commitment\r\n\r\nto good public education\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non restroom manners, he started an Association and went on to\r\n\r\nhost  the  first WTO Conference here.

He even commissioned a Toilet Anthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many more such fine Singaporeans, from all\r\n\r\nwalks  of  life, who come forward to help make our  community\r\n\r\nbetter:  Subaraj Rajathurai, Prof Bernard Tan, Brother Joseph\r\n\r\nMcNally,  Prof Aziz Nather, Henry Tay, just to  name  a  few.\r\n\r\nThey are excellent role models for all, as we contemplate how\r\n\r\nto expand the people sector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my father left his hometown. I left\r\n\r\nmine.  I have left the comfort zone in the Public Gallery  to\r\n\r\nhelp ensure that my children do not ever have to be forced to\r\n\r\nleave their hometown.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we remake Singapore, one top priority must be to\r\n\r\ninvolve  all Singaporeans in the Singapore Cause.  To succeed\r\n\r\nin  this, we must listen to their voices, whether from inside\r\n\r\nSingapore,  or from overseas, from high or low, from  EM1  or\r\n\r\nEM3.   After  all, let us have the humility to admit  at  the\r\n\r\nindividual level we are all bundles of EM1 and EM3.   We  may\r\n\r\nbe strong in one area, but we could be hopeless in many other\r\n\r\nareas.  Take myself as an example.  In economics and economic\r\n\r\nmanagement, I probably qualify for EM1.  In many other areas,\r\n\r\nI  am  at best EM3.  In poetry, I fail, I think.  But whether\r\n\r\none fails or not, one must have hope.  You are a failure only\r\n\r\nif you allow yourself to be condemned as one.  That is why  a\r\n\r\nfew weeks ago when my grassroots leader suggested that at the\r\n\r\nnext  Tanjong  Pagar constituency's National  Day  dinner,  I\r\n\r\nshould  partner with Ms Indranee Rajah to sing a duet and  in\r\n\r\nCantonese, I looked at him and said, \"Me singing?  Some  more\r\n\r\nin  Cantonese?\"  Then I remember lifelong learning.  So I  am\r\n\r\nnow  croaking at EM3 level, but I am putting in  the  effort.\r\n\r\nCome National Day, I am confident I should be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nable to perform at least EM2 to match Indranee's EM1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how do we engage all Singaporeans, especially the\r\n\r\nyounger generation, in the remaking of Singapore? What do  we\r\n\r\nneed  to do?  Change our style?  Change our assumptions about\r\n\r\nthem?  Change our attitudes as adults?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through my work in the Economic Review Committee, I am\r\n\r\nexperimenting  by  working  with  overseas  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nreside  in  the US.  Yes, there was some initial  scepticism,\r\n\r\neven cynicism, among some of the young participants.  But  as\r\n\r\nwe  engage  them more, I sense a strong pool of goodwill  and\r\n\r\nenthusiasm to want to contribute to make a difference.   Many\r\n\r\nare  now  burning  their weekends and their  nights  on  this\r\n\r\nproject, with lots of emails in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media reports on their activities have in turn\r\n\r\nprompted  a  group  of young professionals in  Singapore,  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own  initiative,  to also work  into  the  nights  and\r\n\r\nweekends, so as to be able to contribute to the work  of  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review Committee.  It has been a very heart-warming\r\n\r\nexperience for me.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One key take-away in this experiment is that we should\r\n\r\nnever   assume  that  the  young  would  not  have  much   to\r\n\r\ncontribute.  They may have different values, different points\r\n\r\nof  reference.  They may see the need for \"fun\" together with\r\n\r\nbeing  \"serious\".   But  that does not  mean  that  they  are\r\n\r\nfrivolous.  Their energy and freshness of ideas should find a\r\n\r\nhappy merger with the older folk's wisdom and experience,  to\r\n\r\nevolve and advance the Singapore Cause.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore can make it economically and socially. We\r\n\r\njust  need to dream big and work together for a great future.\r\n\r\nI  continue to see the future of Singapore full of excitement\r\n\r\nand  hope,  and lots of scope for everyone to  play  a  part,\r\n\r\nregardless of race, language or religion.  There is  a  place\r\n\r\nunder the sun for everyone, from all walks of life, to fulfil\r\n\r\ntheir dreams and to make a difference to the lives of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To succeed, we need to engage all Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nespecially  the  younger  generation,  and  transform   their\r\n\r\nSingapore  Dream, so that it is not just a Global Dream,  but\r\n\r\nhas the Singapore Cause deeply embedded in it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  yesterday  afternoon, Mr Seng  Han  Thong  remarked  in\r\n\r\nParliament  that  his residents complained  about  having  no\r\n\r\nlinkway  between the blocks and the market,  and  hence  they\r\n\r\nwere unable to go to the market.  Let me tell him that in  my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  there  is no linkway to  the  market  and  the\r\n\r\nresidents never complain.  They have been going to the market\r\n\r\non  rainy days for many years.  So I wonder whether  this  is\r\n\r\nthe result of the education by the PAP in using the tactic of\r\n\r\nupgrading programmes to win voters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the General Election in 2001 was held\r\n\r\nin  the midst of Singapore's economic slowdown, the September\r\n\r\n11  event  in  the  US  and the turbulence  in  the  regional\r\n\r\npolitics.   The Singapore electorate believed  in  the  PAP's\r\n\r\nability to run the country, expected more good years to come,\r\n\r\nand  hoped to have continued assets value-enhancement  and  a\r\n\r\nbetter  life.   The  PAP  won  an unprecedented  victory  and\r\n\r\nachieved its envisaged political goal.  I want to remind  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government that, in the next five years, its  priorities\r\n\r\nin the governance of Singapore should be:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, how to restore our economic growth and to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the  people in general can enjoy  the  benefits\r\n\r\nderived  from  such  economic growth.  With  changes  in  the\r\n\r\noverall  economic restructuring, there may appear a situation\r\n\r\nin  which  only  the  high income people  will  benefit  from\r\n\r\nSingapore's  economic growth, while the older  and  unskilled\r\n\r\nworkers  remain  in  the  lower  income  bracket.    If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot narrow the widening income gap and economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  does  not  spread throughout the whole  nation,  then\r\n\r\neconomic growth is only a growth in numbers without any  real\r\n\r\nmeaning to the lower income people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when economic growth does not benefit the\r\n\r\nentire  people and its growth rate is not as good as  before,\r\n\r\nhow  do  we  reduce the burden of the people of Singapore  in\r\n\r\ntheir daily lives?  In his Address, the President pointed out\r\n\r\nthat our national wage level was higher than before. I quote,\r\n\r\n\"We  can  no  longer expect to grow by 8 to 10 percent,  year\r\n\r\nafter year, as we did before the Asian Financial Crisis, even\r\n\r\nif  we were to work as hard or harder than before. That phase\r\n\r\nof our economic development is over.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the PAP Government is asking the people not to\r\n\r\nexpect  high economic growth, can the people also expect  the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government to review the charges it has been levying for\r\n\r\nall  the services it provides, and the criteria in which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment says is \"affordable to the people\"?  For  example,\r\n\r\nin  medical  costs,  selling price of  HDB  flats,  utilities\r\n\r\ncharges  and  the university tuition fees.  All these  prices\r\n\r\nare based on the so-called \"affordability\".  Now the economic\r\n\r\nsituation  has  changed.  Should not the PAP Government  have\r\n\r\nthe  moral  obligation to re-define what are the prices  that\r\n\r\nthe ordinary citizens can really afford?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is particularly so with our ageing population.\r\n\r\nThere  will  be  greater  demand  for  medical  services  and\r\n\r\nconvalescent  homes.  The PAP Government  recently  announced\r\n\r\nthe  policy  of  leaving convalescent homes  to  the  private\r\n\r\nsector to operate.   With such privately operated facilities,\r\n\r\nwill the charges be so high that it will eventually become  a\r\n\r\nburden on Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, how is the PAP Government going to enable every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  to make the best use of his or her talents?   As\r\n\r\nwe  all  know,  we  are facing  unemployment  problem.   With\r\n\r\neconomic  restructuring, unemployed workers may not get  back\r\n\r\nthe  same jobs and pay, even after the economy has recovered.\r\n\r\nMany of them are middle-aged.  They need a regular income  to\r\n\r\nmaintain their families.  Apart from a steady job to maintain\r\n\r\nthe  family,  it  is  more important to make  these  employed\r\n\r\npeople feel that what they have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlearned  could  be put to good use and that their  respective\r\n\r\ntalents  could be given their full play, rather  than  merely\r\n\r\ndoing a job and earning a living.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PAP Government is of the view that Singapore is a\r\n\r\nsmall  country with not enough talented people around.  There\r\n\r\nis  therefore a need to attract foreign talents to supplement\r\n\r\nthe  local ones.  I agree with this principle.  The  question\r\n\r\nis:  has the Government done all that it can to identify  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  the  local  talents?   The  PAP  Government  adopted\r\n\r\ncertain  policies  to  save cost  and  to  avoid  wastage  in\r\n\r\neducational  spending.  Have these policies resulted  in  our\r\n\r\ntoday's shortage of talents?  For example, the quota  on  the\r\n\r\nintake  of  medical  students.  In  the  past,  students  who\r\n\r\nstudied  at the polytechnics were not allowed to  go  to  the\r\n\r\nuniversities.    Students   who  were   streamed   into   the\r\n\r\nmonolingual  stream would have no chance to  go  to  a  main-stream  secondary school.  Although these policies have  been\r\n\r\nmodified,  I  believe  the  PAP  Government  is  capable   of\r\n\r\nundertaking  greater  reform to enable Singaporeans  to  have\r\n\r\nmore chances to become talented people, thereby strengthening\r\n\r\ntheir ability to compete with foreign talents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, how do we ensure that the workers are not\r\n\r\ntreated unfairly by employers?  In the high growth and  tight\r\n\r\nlabour market, we regard the workers as kings.  But now, when\r\n\r\nthe  economic  situation has changed, job  opportunities  are\r\n\r\nscarce,  job  seekers are at the mercy of the employers,  and\r\n\r\nhence  it is the turn for employers to become kings.  How  do\r\n\r\nwe  ensure  that  in such a situation, the  workers  are  not\r\n\r\nexploited or treated unfairly by the employers should be  the\r\n\r\nimmediate concern of the Government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the effect of the September 11 event on\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  the  recent  arrest  of  Jemaah  Islamiyah\r\n\r\nterrorists  in  Singapore  make  us  better   appreciate  the\r\n\r\nvulnerability of Singapore and the importance of  our  social\r\n\r\ncohesion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party equally cares for Singapore's\r\n\r\nsecurity and regards as its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nresponsibility   the  protection  of  Singapore's   interest.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  Workers'  Party  supports  the  Government's\r\n\r\nefforts  to  safeguard the peace and security  of  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe   Workers'   Party   also   welcomes   the   Government's\r\n\r\nannouncement to open up more space for Singaporeans  to  take\r\n\r\npart  in  political  discussions  and  acknowledges  that  on\r\n\r\nspecific  policies, those with different views can also  help\r\n\r\nin the policy making, to benefit the majority of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to achieve the aim of uniting the people to work\r\n\r\ntogether   in  remaking  Singapore,  the  Government   should\r\n\r\nexercise more tolerance.  It should transcend party interest,\r\n\r\nand  should not regard Singapore as though it belongs to  the\r\n\r\nPAP  alone.   The  PAP  is the PAP.  But,  Singapore  is  our\r\n\r\nnation.   Whether we agree or disagree with the PAP,  we  are\r\n\r\nall part of the nation.  The rise and fall of a nation is the\r\n\r\nbusiness of every citizen.  It is only when the ruling  party\r\n\r\nand the people in general get out of the shadow of failing to\r\n\r\nseparate the party from the nation, can we truly be a  united\r\n\r\npeople in remaking a new Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise in\r\n\r\nsupport  of the motion thanking the President for his Address\r\n\r\nin Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I sat listening to the President's Address, I\r\n\r\nwondered  how  many  in Singapore watched  the  telecast  and\r\n\r\nlistened  to  the  President's Address.  More  so,  how  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans felt the sense of vulnerability as we faced  the\r\n\r\nmany  security,  social  and economic challenges  before  us.\r\n\r\nMore   importantly,  I  wondered  how  many  had   felt   the\r\n\r\noverwhelming  sense of urgency in facing up to  and  even  to\r\n\r\nbegin in an attempt to tackle these problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaking of Singapore is our roadmap to survival in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  years.   I  am  sure that  in  the  remaking  of\r\n\r\nSingapore, the various committees set up will address many of\r\n\r\nthe  areas  that require shoring up, many of the  areas  that\r\n\r\nrequire revamps and new areas that need to be looked at.   As\r\n\r\nwe course through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuncertain future ahead, I am comforted by the stance taken by\r\n\r\nthe Remaking of Singapore team to leave no stone unturned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we go about remaking, I urge the Government not\r\n\r\nto  take  lightly  the understanding of  the  psyche  of  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean.  As our honourable colleague, Mr Seng Han Thong,\r\n\r\nhas  interestingly pointed out yesterday in his  speech,  the\r\n\r\nuniqueness  of  the  typical Singaporean qualities  or,  more\r\n\r\nspecifically,   the  die-hard  single-minded  deployment   of\r\n\r\noverseas   shopping  and  travel  survival  techniques,   can\r\n\r\nhopefully and plausibly turn around as an ingredient  in  our\r\n\r\nnation's  survival.  It is an example described by  Mr  Seng.\r\n\r\nIt  is  evident that we must try to see what societal effects\r\n\r\npolicies have on our people over a long term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Singaporean that we have so conditioned for the\r\n\r\npast  36 years can be seen as two sides of the same coin.   A\r\n\r\ncannot-lose  Singaporean is seen as kiasu.  It  is  the  same\r\n\r\ndogged,  hardworking, innovative, persistent and going-to-be-more-creative  Singaporean who strives for better  grades  in\r\n\r\nschools, one who wants to secure a better job, one who  works\r\n\r\nhard - mind you, efficiently and productively - he also wants\r\n\r\nto move up in his or her career and to upgrade to a flat with\r\n\r\nanother  one  or  more rooms.  There is  nothing  wrong  with\r\n\r\naspiring for a better tomorrow and to have the better  things\r\n\r\nin life.  After all, we work hard for these things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the other side of the coin? As a competitive\r\n\r\nand  street-savvy  Singaporean took shape over  the  past  30\r\n\r\nyears to help steer our nation to where we are today, we  did\r\n\r\nnot  count on the same Singaporean becoming very much focused\r\n\r\non  the five Cs.  We need to temper and balance ourselves  as\r\n\r\nwe  seek these five Cs.  I think the addition of two other Cs\r\n\r\n-  that  of community and country - can and must be the  only\r\n\r\nway  forward.  If Singaporeans can self-actualise  and  spend\r\n\r\ntime serving the community and being an active citizen, I  am\r\n\r\nsure,   in  time,  we  can  have  a  more  rounded,  gracious\r\n\r\nSingaporean, and discard some of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstereotypes  that we have been associated  with.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat we can ignite that bit of altruism that I know exists in\r\n\r\nthe  heart  of  Singaporeans to serve their community.   Yes,\r\n\r\nevery Singaporean matters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, permit me to use an analogy. I call it the rear-view mirror analogy. Many Singaporeans drive, or at least\r\n\r\nhave  been backseat drivers.  I wonder how many and how often\r\n\r\nthese  drivers look at their rear-view mirrors from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime,  except  when they want to filter lanes,  when  someone\r\n\r\nhonks  at  them, when flashing lights or someone  in  uniform\r\n\r\ngestures for them to pull aside.  If drivers could glance  at\r\n\r\ntheir rear-view mirrors from time to time to notice that they\r\n\r\ncould  let someone pass, filtering aside, letting the quicker\r\n\r\ntraffic  along, we would all have less stress on the  highway\r\n\r\nand, definitely, more smiles and less rude glares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pursuit of the five Cs, in driving for these, if\r\n\r\nwe  show some care and consideration for the community around\r\n\r\nus  and  initiate some sacrifice of time and effort, we  will\r\n\r\nindeed  have a more gracious society and a more balanced  and\r\n\r\nmeaningful  life.  In housing estates, I call on Singaporeans\r\n\r\nto flash the first smile to a resident passing by their flat,\r\n\r\nto  offer  the first handshake to the residents left,  right,\r\n\r\ndownstairs and upstairs of them.  This would be the community\r\n\r\nthat  they can first be active in.  Sir, I have noticed that,\r\n\r\namong  Malay  residents, the rapport  between  them,  between\r\n\r\nunits,  between  blocks, different zones, is very  close  and\r\n\r\nvery  warm.  Perhaps, our Chinese residents could learn  from\r\n\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another \"C\" that can be added to make these 8 Cs is\r\n\r\ncompassion, shown on the Government's part.  I hope  that  in\r\n\r\nthe  remaking  of Singapore, the process and  the  Government\r\n\r\norganisations  can show some compassion to  Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  caught in between policy changes.  We do understand that\r\n\r\nimplementation of changes in policies will affect some people\r\n\r\nnegatively.   Nevertheless, some compassion and consideration\r\n\r\nmust  be shown to these citizens affected and not treat  them\r\n\r\njust  as  a  negligible statistic or collateral  damage.   By\r\n\r\nshowing more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompassion in situations like these, citizens find it  easier\r\n\r\nto  buy  in on the Government's call for Singaporeans  to  be\r\n\r\nactive  citizens or to do a part in community work  and  some\r\n\r\nother  form of social outreach requiring a draw-down on one's\r\n\r\ncapacity for compassion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the beginning of my speech, I\r\n\r\nwondered if many Singaporeans felt the vulnerabilities before\r\n\r\nus and the sense of urgency to face up to and to tackle these\r\n\r\nproblems.   We need to reach down deep into their hearts  for\r\n\r\nthe passion that they have for our country, that we will have\r\n\r\nsome  sense  of hope for the years ahead.  Sir,  we  need  to\r\n\r\ninstill  in Singaporeans the kind of gut-wrenching commitment\r\n\r\nand  conviction that our first-generation leaders had in them\r\n\r\nthat  brought  us from the brink to the kind of Singapore  we\r\n\r\nhave today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we find our foot being stepped on.\r\n\r\nThen  we  are chided for deliberately keeping our  toe  nails\r\n\r\nlong   and   hurt  the  sensitive  souls  of   the   stepper.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must know that this will not change for quite  a\r\n\r\nwhile  yet.   What  can we do?  Keep moving, keep  shuffling,\r\n\r\nkeep focused on our chosen path, and trim our nails from time\r\n\r\nto  time  and keep them sharp at other times.  This situation\r\n\r\nis  not  helped  by  the constantly changing  ground  we  are\r\n\r\nrunning on.  We have little or no control of the direction in\r\n\r\nwhich  the  ground moves or the magnitude of the  shift.   We\r\n\r\nneed  to  be  nimble  as a nation and  to  adapt  and  change\r\n\r\ndirections  quicker  than the next  guy  in  the  same  race.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must know that each obstacle we face must add to\r\n\r\nthe  fire in the belly in all of us to press on.  It  is  the\r\n\r\nfire  in the belly that fuels our determination not to  fail.\r\n\r\nThat  was  true  before, and it has to  be  true  today  and,\r\n\r\nespecially, over the next few years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could hear, as recent as five years ago, the\r\n\r\nlament from the older generation that younger Singaporeans do\r\n\r\nnot  know what it means to be hungry, the uncertainty of  not\r\n\r\nknowing  whether there will be jobs tomorrow,  or  wonder  if\r\n\r\nthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould ever have decent homes or even a decent livelihood,  as\r\n\r\nthe  older generations have had to experience.  Although  the\r\n\r\nidea,  that young Singaporeans needed a crisis so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould learn to appreciate and value what we had, bordered  on\r\n\r\nidiocy,  the Asian crisis in 1998, the economic downturn  and\r\n\r\nthe events of September 11, have presented this generation of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans some very sobering experiences.  I hope that  it\r\n\r\ndoes  not  take too long to ignite this passion and  to  find\r\n\r\nsome common gut-wrenching sense of purpose to perpetuate  the\r\n\r\nkind  of  life we are used to in Singapore.  To  ignite  this\r\n\r\npassion  and commitment to get all of us united to  run  this\r\n\r\nmarathon,  we  better  find a very short  burning  fuse  very\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address has underscored that some fuses\r\n\r\nhad  already  started burning.  The explosive growth  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  market is something the world is watching carefully,\r\n\r\neach  economy assessing where, what and how it can capture  a\r\n\r\nslice  of  it.  A Taiwanese businessman told me not too  long\r\n\r\nago  that the cost of running his business in Taiwan has come\r\n\r\nto  such a state that he could no longer continue and had  to\r\n\r\nmove  his  manufacturing facilities to mainland  China.   But\r\n\r\nthen  again, Sir, he added that if he was doing very well  in\r\n\r\nTaiwan,  the  more  reason he should  move  his  business  to\r\n\r\nmainland China.  We are seeing that happening on our  shores.\r\n\r\nThen,  some  fuses have already been ignited since  September\r\n\r\n11,  and  the  charges are continually being  laid,  and  the\r\n\r\nuncertainty and when the next fuse would be lit is a  spectre\r\n\r\nhanging over us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with so many wild cards on the horizon, I hope that\r\n\r\nthe remaking of Singapore will carry as many Singaporeans  as\r\n\r\npossible  in  its efforts not just to those who can  identify\r\n\r\nwith it on a higher cerebral level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, just as every Singaporean matters,\r\n\r\nSingapore  should matter to every Singaporean.  I think  this\r\n\r\nis the essence of the remaking of Singapore.  At this point I\r\n\r\nwould  like to make a few comments on the speech by the  hon.\r\n\r\nMr Low Thia Khiang.  He mentioned that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntalent  pool in Singapore, our local talent, could have  been\r\n\r\nthe result of our policies.  With this foreign talent that we\r\n\r\nhave  been  talking about these many years, this  supplements\r\n\r\nour  local talent.  And not only that, our local talent  will\r\n\r\nlearn  and  surpass these talents from overseas.   Take,  for\r\n\r\nexample, in banking.  Young men from overseas in the treasury\r\n\r\nrooms,  who are dealing with derivatives, have been  used  to\r\n\r\nand  have  been  dealing  in,  structuring,  producing  these\r\n\r\nderivative products at the age of 23 or 24, and they come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  they work with fairly older Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  27 to 30 and, very soon, the same Singaporeans are  able\r\n\r\nto  produce these products at the snap of a finger.   Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia  Khiang  comments that he supports the PAP  Government's\r\n\r\nefforts  in  pulling our country together.  It is  admirable.\r\n\r\nHowever, I caution that Singaporeans must not be bought in on\r\n\r\ncalls  that  could  be  divisive in  times  like  this.   The\r\n\r\nPresident's Address has stated succinctly what we  will  face\r\n\r\nand the urgent call to remake Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I therefore support the Motion to thank\r\n\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Siew Kim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Siew Kim (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Motion of Thanks to the President, and thank  you\r\n\r\nfor giving me the privilege to participate in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address to Parliament, has given\r\n\r\nus  a  realistic scenario of Singapore's future.  It  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be  smooth  sailing.   I  remember  someone   once\r\n\r\ncharacterised Singapore's challenge as paddling upstream  all\r\n\r\nthe  time.   But, folks, it is not going to get  better.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to leave the safe waters of our rivers and venture into\r\n\r\nthe  open  seas.  There will be strong currents, we  will  be\r\n\r\nbuffetted by waves caused by bigger passing ships over  which\r\n\r\nwe  have  little control.  Inevitably, there will be  storms.\r\n\r\nBut  it is not a totally gloomy voyage.  If one is alert  and\r\n\r\ncareful,   navigate  well,  there  will  still  be  beautiful\r\n\r\nskylines  and shores to admire, and periods of calm  seas  to\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  fruits of our hard work.  Against this  backdrop,\r\n\r\nthe President spoke of the challenges for Singapore, one of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich   is   the  priority  to  strengthen  the   spirit   of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  and risk-taking among Singaporeans  as  the\r\n\r\nbasis for Singapore's future competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe that there are two pillars\r\n\r\nrequired to nurture and enhance these qualities for survival.\r\n\r\nThe  first  is  to  encourage and inculcate  that  spirit  in\r\n\r\nindividuals, especially our young.  We must try to instill in\r\n\r\nour  young  thinking  and questioning  skills,  curiosity  to\r\n\r\nexplore and the knack to take measured risks.  Our young must\r\n\r\nnot fear failures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me recount a story from one of my constituents. The\r\n\r\nboy failed badly in the \"O\" levels and, in order to resit, he\r\n\r\nhad to seek the permission of the principal who said that  he\r\n\r\nwould  allow it if the boy could get 10 signatures  from  his\r\n\r\nformer teachers to support his retake.  He tried but he  only\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  obtain five signatures.  He was chided  by  some\r\n\r\nteachers and told not to bother and waste his time.  He  went\r\n\r\nhome  dejected.  Thank goodness, his principal  relented  and\r\n\r\nthe  boy is now studying, relishing his second chance.  While\r\n\r\nit  is  not  time yet to say that this boy would succeed  the\r\n\r\nsecond time round, the story hits home on the need to give  a\r\n\r\nsecond  chance,  especially when one recognises  failure  and\r\n\r\nstoke that spark of courage to try again.  What the principal\r\n\r\ndid was to etch in the youngster's mind the value of a second\r\n\r\nopportunity  and  making  him  go  round  and  work  for  it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the incident also speaks of the  teachers  who\r\n\r\nturned  their backs on him when he wanted to try again.   But\r\n\r\nthe  fact that he managed to get even five signatures  speaks\r\n\r\nof the graciousness of our society.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young must view failures as opportunity to learn and\r\n\r\nhow  to  do it better the next time.  If we succeed  in  this\r\n\r\ninvestment  in our young right here in our schools,  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  a  generation of more entrepreneurial Singaporeans  who\r\n\r\nare  stout  of heart and are more willing to take  risk,  for\r\n\r\nrisk and entrepreneurship go hand in hand.  In some ways,  we\r\n\r\nhave  been victims of our own success.  Singaporeans who  had\r\n\r\nthe opportunity to be better educated and had grown up in  an\r\n\r\neconomy that was experiencing high\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrowth  are  naturally  more likely to choose  secure  career\r\n\r\npaths.   It  has  often been heard that opportunity  cost  is\r\n\r\nsometimes  too  high  to  do  otherwise.   Risk  aversion  is\r\n\r\nunderstandable.   We  must start in  our  schools.   We  have\r\n\r\nalready  incorporated  many activities and  programmes  which\r\n\r\nwill  encourage  our younger Singaporeans to  think  more  on\r\n\r\ntheir feet, think out of the box, come up with new ideas  and\r\n\r\nexplore   new   frontiers  that  may   well   lead   to   new\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Project work now scores towards qualification\r\n\r\nfor  a  place in the university.  Much has been done in  this\r\n\r\narea.  The curriculum in our educational institutions must be\r\n\r\ncontinuously  adapted to teach thinking and discovery  skills\r\n\r\nthat  will  help  everyone to manage through  the  continuous\r\n\r\nchanges that can be expected in the new economy.  However, it\r\n\r\nwill  still  be  some years before this generation  comes  of\r\n\r\nworking age.  It will still be some time before we have  more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  who  by  exposure and training,  have  a  high\r\n\r\naffinity to take risks and reap the rewards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, we are promoting this spirit of\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship  in our working adults and  to  widen  their\r\n\r\nperspective.  There are now increased opportunities for  many\r\n\r\nto  explore  outside  their  workplace.   For  example,  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans are given the opportunity to take on  short-term\r\n\r\nor  long-term jobs outside Singapore.  This is essential  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  employers must push their employees to do  so  for\r\n\r\nnothing  replaces  the experience and exposure  that  such  a\r\n\r\nworking stint would bring.  Others have the chance to further\r\n\r\ntheir   studies   or   take  short-term  management   courses\r\n\r\nelsewhere.   Such exposure is necessary to give one  a  wider\r\n\r\nperspective  and to learn from others.  The interaction  with\r\n\r\nother  cultures and working styles all add to  enhance  one's\r\n\r\nexperience and knowledge and plug Singapore into the regional\r\n\r\nand  global  economies.  The Government has  encouraged  this\r\n\r\nthrough its many schemes and should continue to do its utmost\r\n\r\nto promote them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second pillar, I believe, is to do the same, ie, to\r\n\r\ninculcate this spirit of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship, an element of risk-taking among  our  large\r\n\r\nlocal corporations and SMEs.  We have to build up world-class\r\n\r\nenterprises that are able to compete globally.  The 1960s and\r\n\r\nbefore,  Singapore was essentially an entreport.  To survive,\r\n\r\nour  people had to depend on hard work and survival instincts\r\n\r\nto  eke  out  a  living.   We provided labour,  exported  the\r\n\r\nnatural  resources  of  our region to  the  wider  world  and\r\n\r\nreceived in turn manufactured goods for onward transshipment.\r\n\r\nTo  survive  and  survive better, we worked at  being  better\r\n\r\norganised, more efficient and more competitive than the  rest\r\n\r\nof  the  region.   Then, the MNCs came and built  some  basic\r\n\r\nmanufacturing   plants.   Our  people   became   increasingly\r\n\r\neducated, and as a consequence, MNCs brought in their  higher\r\n\r\nvalue-added activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, we learnt quickly. We took some\r\n\r\nnecessary risks and went on to build our own companies,  some\r\n\r\nof  which  today  have gained some measure  of  regional  and\r\n\r\ninternational reputation.  For the successful ones, surpluses\r\n\r\nhave   piled   up  but,  more  importantly,  there   was   an\r\n\r\naccumulation of intellectual know-how, technical  skills  and\r\n\r\nmanagerial  competence.  This happened across industries  and\r\n\r\nthe  magnitude of this intellectual property that now  exists\r\n\r\nin Singapore cannot be under-valued.  We have now built up  a\r\n\r\nworkforce  of  Singaporeans who are very different  from  the\r\n\r\n1960s.    We   now  have  the  opportunity  to   export   our\r\n\r\nintellectual software.  In some ways, it is like coming  full\r\n\r\ncircle but, this time, it is not hard labour, but high value-added  labour,  backed  up  by  institutional  knowledge  and\r\n\r\nexpertise  that  we  are  able to provide.   We  have  proven\r\n\r\nexpertise  in  many  areas.    Some  good  examples  are  our\r\n\r\nairport,   our   seaport  and  how  we  have  developed   our\r\n\r\npetrochemical  and  logistics hubs.  We must,  therefore,  be\r\n\r\nfocused  and  concentrate our firepower in these  and  others\r\n\r\nthat we excel in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while we have come a long way, we\r\n\r\ncannot  rest  on our laurels.  We must move and move  boldly.\r\n\r\nWith a limited domestic base, we know we can only do so much.\r\n\r\nGrowth  must  be export-led.  We have to take  our  expertise\r\n\r\noutside\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  proverbial external wing  must  spread  and\r\n\r\nsoar, for as Napoleon had said, \"Ability is of little account\r\n\r\nwithout  opportunity\".   For Singapore,  we  must  go  forth,\r\n\r\ncreate and seek these opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Services were featured prominently in the President's\r\n\r\nSpeech.   I  truly believe that our people, on the coat-tails\r\n\r\nof  the  large Singapore companies and established SMEs,  are\r\n\r\nable  to  venture abroad and bring with them the intellectual\r\n\r\ncapital that is distinctly Singapore.  We have begun to do so\r\n\r\nbut  we  can do much more.  No longer can we make incremental\r\n\r\nmoves.   We have to have that courage to make quantum  leaps.\r\n\r\nLet  us  not  be  held back by the old ways we  have  handled\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  within  our  shores.   Let  us  marshal  the\r\n\r\ncollective  firepower  of light-minded  Singapore  companies,\r\n\r\nconcentrate  their value offerings and venture abroad.   Yes,\r\n\r\nthere  had  been  failures and there  will  be  failures  and\r\n\r\npessimists abound.  There would be more short-term  setbacks.\r\n\r\nThere would be those who would quickly say, \"I told you  so\".\r\n\r\nBut  to  succeed,  we  must take the  longer  term  view  and\r\n\r\nrecognise our competitors likewise would pit against us  with\r\n\r\ntheir own vehemence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switzerland, Finland, Netherlands, countries that have\r\n\r\nsimilar  constraints as Singapore, have companies that  stand\r\n\r\nup  among  the  global 150.  Switzerland has 6,  Nokia  leads\r\n\r\nFinland's charge, Netherlands, through the Royal Dutch/Shell,\r\n\r\nING,  Philips, Unilever and Aegonelay claim to five.  In  our\r\n\r\npart  of the world, Taiwan has one and even the tiny  SAR  of\r\n\r\nHong Kong has two in the form of Hutchinson Whampoa and China\r\n\r\nMobile.   We can likewise do so.  Success will breed success.\r\n\r\nWhen  some  of  our companies succeed, others will  have  the\r\n\r\ncourage to venture likewise.  Let us have the courage to take\r\n\r\nthe  first  steps and help some of our companies  to  succeed\r\n\r\nlong term on a global scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While theorists will argue on a hands-off Hong Kong\r\n\r\napproach  or the MITI-led Japanese extreme, we must recognise\r\n\r\nthat Singapore must fine-tune its own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napproach, one that is appropriate to our circumstance.  Here,\r\n\r\nI  believe that the Government's role has two facets.  One is\r\n\r\nto  push  certain  companies out more  quickly  in  a  bolder\r\n\r\nfashion  than  they would otherwise do.  And two,  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  go  forth  with the collective  capabilities  and\r\n\r\nknowledge base that Singapore has to offer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hon. Members have spoken on the need to merge\r\n\r\nfor critical size.  I strongly second that.  If companies can\r\n\r\ncome  together and combine resources or complement expertise,\r\n\r\nwe would be more formidable.  This was the dimension that was\r\n\r\nmissing in our arsenal of the 1960s.  Now we cannot afford to\r\n\r\nforsake  such  growth  engines.  Take a couple  of  potential\r\n\r\nglobal champions and unleash them, nurture and support  these\r\n\r\nglobal   and   regional  champions  in  their  forays   while\r\n\r\nencouraging them to anchor their knowledge intensive IP-heavy\r\n\r\neconomic  activities  in  Singapore.   They  would   be   the\r\n\r\nmotherships   around  which  the  SMEs   would   sail   with,\r\n\r\nbenefitting  from  the multiplier effects,  further  spawning\r\n\r\nmore  domestic  players  and  providing  employment  for  our\r\n\r\nworkers.   Yes, we will encounter storms.  The flotilla  must\r\n\r\nstay  on  course for among seamen it is aptly  put  that  the\r\n\r\nwinds  and  the  waves are always on the side of  the  ablest\r\n\r\nnavigators.  We must keep faith.  Just as MNCs had  been  the\r\n\r\nemployer of choice for many young Singaporeans, it would come\r\n\r\na  day  when Singapore-grown MNCs will hold the same prestige\r\n\r\nfor  the future young from within and without.  Then  can  we\r\n\r\nattract the best talent, local and foreign, increase our gene\r\n\r\npool, renew and enhance our intellectual capital.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nowhere am I suggesting that we should\r\n\r\nprotect  local  enterprises at all  costs.   They  must  have\r\n\r\nviable product or service offerings.  All I am saying is that\r\n\r\ncompetition   is   out  there  and  not  amongst   ourselves.\r\n\r\nCompetition  is now on a global scale.  This trend  will  not\r\n\r\nlet  up  and  global competition will be the  norm  for  more\r\n\r\nindustries  in time to come.  And if we are to  come  through\r\n\r\nand  succeed, we better lie in our ships to deliver the  most\r\n\r\nferocious broadside.  But\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  about our smaller enterprises?  They may not  yet  have\r\n\r\nthe  capability  to take that leap.  How  can  we  help  them\r\n\r\ncompete  in this new global economy?  We must not  just  give\r\n\r\nthem a fish to survive another day, but rather teach them  to\r\n\r\nfish  so  that  they  will survive  a  lifetime.   For  these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  especially those in niche  markets,  we  need  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  in them, to support their ventures with capital  and\r\n\r\nmanagement  know-how.   And  more  importantly,   leave   the\r\n\r\nscientists  and the entrepreneurs, the people who are  driven\r\n\r\nby  passion  and  vision, to get on  with  their  work.   The\r\n\r\nchallenge  is  perhaps seeking out these companies  with  the\r\n\r\nright   formula  for  future  growth.   Next  is  to   resist\r\n\r\ntemptation to invade these companies and force-fit them  into\r\n\r\nstandard management models.  It is about providing them  with\r\n\r\nthe right impetus to grow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may ask how the support I spoke about earlier for\r\n\r\nthe  larger companies co-exists with this nurture for smaller\r\n\r\nenterprises.  There is no contradiction.  Both are  parts  of\r\n\r\nthe  same vibrant eco-system, supporting the growth  of  each\r\n\r\nother   to   ensure  continued  survival.   As  the   smaller\r\n\r\nenterprises   grow,  they  could  well  be   the   seeds   of\r\n\r\nreinvention.  How else did Nokia, a lumber company, for  most\r\n\r\nof    its    existence   become   synonymous   with    mobile\r\n\r\ntelecommunications today?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, while I advocate bonus\r\n\r\nin seeking opportunities outside Singapore, I also advocate a\r\n\r\nGovernment role in focusing and driving the pace.  Let us not\r\n\r\nget  mired  in  ideological discourse  but  to  implement  an\r\n\r\napproach  that  best  utilises the  growth  engines  that  we\r\n\r\nalready have.  Without intervention, some companies with  the\r\n\r\nright expertise may not have the guts to go beyond our shores\r\n\r\nand  the smaller ones may not have that opportunity to  build\r\n\r\nup its expertise.  It will always be a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndifficult  risk-benefit  equation but  risk  must  be  taken.\r\n\r\nHuman  and  financial  capital are all  we  have.   Both  are\r\n\r\ntemporal  in nature.  We must make the best use of  both  and\r\n\r\nmultiply  them to ensure our continued survival so  that  the\r\n\r\nnext  generation  will  live in a  steadfast  and  prosperous\r\n\r\nSingapore,  just as our forefathers had prepared  the  ground\r\n\r\nfor  us.   The time is now.  We are at a crossroad.  We  must\r\n\r\nact  and  move  boldly and quickly seize  the  opportunities.\r\n\r\nFuture generations of Singaporeans depend on us to make steam\r\n\r\nand navigate well.
