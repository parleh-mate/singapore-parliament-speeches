(SES) suspended  the  trading  of\r\n\r\nshares of Mid-Continent Equipment Ltd on SESDAQ, and whether the\r\n\r\nSES should have approved the `Initial\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic Offer' application by the company, especially considering\r\n\r\nthe large percentage of private placement shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, trading in the shares of Mid-Continent Equipment Group  Ltd\r\n\r\n(\"Mid-Continent\")  on SESDAQ began on 22nd July  1998  following\r\n\r\nits  initial public offer (\"IPO\") of 18 million shares at  $0.15\r\n\r\neach.  SES  suspended trading in the counter on 31st July  1998,\r\n\r\nfollowing a sharp run-up in prices and large volumes during  the\r\n\r\nfirst eight days of trading, and  confirmed on 11th August  1998\r\n\r\nthat the shares in Mid-Continent had been cornered. The SES  has\r\n\r\nreferred the case to the CAD to investigate possible offences of\r\n\r\nmanipulation  under the Securities Industry Act. The  attachment\r\n\r\n(Cols.  985  - 988) that I have circulated to Members  sets  out\r\n\r\nfully the facts of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980904/19980904-HA-0690985.htm\">Attachment - The Trading and Suspension of Mid-Continent Shares on SESDAQ (Cols. 985 - 988)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES approved Mid-Continent's IPO application because\r\n\r\nMid-Continent met the listing requirements for a company  to  be\r\n\r\nadmitted  to  SESDAQ,  according  to  the  existing  rules   and\r\n\r\nprocedures. However, the Mid-Continent case revealed  weaknesses\r\n\r\nin these rules and procedures that need to be put right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Concentration of Placement Shares</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the Mid-Continent IPO was an over-concentration of shares in the hands of a few persons. 90% of\r\n\r\nthe IPO shares were placed privately with only five persons. The\r\n\r\ncompany's  shares  were therefore vulnerable to  being  cornered\r\n\r\nwhen trading started.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not MAS or SES policy to require companies to sell\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of shares in an IPO by open subscription  by  the\r\n\r\npublic,  or  to limit the private placement tranche  to  only  a\r\n\r\nsmall percentage of the IPO shares. The listing rules for SESDAQ\r\n\r\nallow  a company to use private placement for up to 25%  of  its\r\n\r\nIPO  shares, or a higher proportion if the SES agrees that there\r\n\r\nare good reasons for doing so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the SES has been flexible in allowing\r\n\r\ncompanies to sell IPO shares via private placement, particularly\r\n\r\nfor Main\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBoard  listings.  SES has used this discretion more  widely  for\r\n\r\nSESDAQ  listings  since August 1997, in view  of  the  difficult\r\n\r\nmarket conditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-Continent was similarly allowed a large private\r\n\r\nplacement tranche of 90%. The problem was not this large private\r\n\r\nplacement  per  se,  but the small number  of  placees  and  the\r\n\r\nresulting over-concentration of IPO shares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present SES rules are inadequate to prevent such over-concentration. Moreover, neither the company nor the issue\r\n\r\nmanager  is required to inform the SES of the number of  placees\r\n\r\nand  their respective shares of the IPO issue. For several years\r\n\r\nnow,  the  SES  has  left it to the issue manager  to  ensure  a\r\n\r\nsufficient  shareholding spread after an IPO so that trading  in\r\n\r\nthe secondary market would be orderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs to be reviewed. In Hong Kong and the United\r\n\r\nKingdom,  a  company can distribute up to 75% of its IPO  shares\r\n\r\nvia  private placement, but this is subject to a tight limit  on\r\n\r\nthe  value  of  shares placed to each investor. Hong  Kong  also\r\n\r\nrequires  a minimum number of such placees.  MAS has  asked  the\r\n\r\nSES  to  propose  rules  to  prevent over-concentration  of  IPO\r\n\r\nshares,  including  the maximum percentage that  can  be  placed\r\n\r\nprivately and the minimum number of placees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once provisions to prevent over-concentration of IPO shares\r\n\r\nare  put  in  place,  issue  managers will  be  responsible  for\r\n\r\ncomplying  with  them  and  ensuring a  sufficient  shareholding\r\n\r\nspread for orderly trading in the secondary market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will also introduce requirements on standards of\r\n\r\nconduct  for issue managers to bring them in line with the  best\r\n\r\npractice internationally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Responsibility for Approving Listing Applications</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also reviewing the procedures for approving\r\n\r\nlistings.    Presently,  the  SES  is  solely  responsible   for\r\n\r\napproving  applications  by  companies  to  list  on  the  stock\r\n\r\nexchange.  In 1983, after a spate of listings\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  doubtful quality, the Minister for Finance had directed  the\r\n\r\nSecurities  Industry  Council (SIC) to advise  the  SES  on  new\r\n\r\nlisting  applications.  The  final decision  on  listings  still\r\n\r\nrested  with  the SES, but there was close consultation  between\r\n\r\nthe SES and SIC. But this arrangement ceased last year after the\r\n\r\nSIC  decided  that  it no longer needed to  review  SES  listing\r\n\r\ndecisions .\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporate Finance Committee chaired by Mr Lim Yong Wah\r\n\r\nis  studying  the  appropriate roles for  the  SES  and  MAS  in\r\n\r\napproving  listing  applications and  the  issue  of  shares  by\r\n\r\ncompanies.  One  issue is whether the MAS should  be  given  the\r\n\r\npower  to overrule decisions of the SES on listing applications,\r\n\r\nwhere   it  considers  this  necessary  to  protect  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.  Regulators in some other jurisdictions  can  exercise\r\n\r\nsuch  veto  powers within a mandated time period. However,  such\r\n\r\npowers should be used sparingly and only when the regulator  has\r\n\r\nstrong  reasons  to  believe that doing  so  is  in  the  public\r\n\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Approval of Listing Applications under a Disclosure-Based Regime</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS agrees with the proposal by the Corporate Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee   for  a  predominantly  disclosure-based   regulation\r\n\r\nregime. This will give more room for the market, rather than the\r\n\r\nregulator,  to  judge the commercial merits of transactions.  It\r\n\r\nwill  help  to  develop  deeper capital  markets,  with  broader\r\n\r\nparticipation from institutional investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But disclosure-based market discipline is not an automatic\r\n\r\nformula  for sound and orderly financial markets. In established\r\n\r\nmarkets  which  adopt a disclosure-based regulatory  philosophy,\r\n\r\nthe  stock  exchange  or  regulator  does  not  totally  suspend\r\n\r\njudgement  on  the  proposals put to it. The stock  exchange  or\r\n\r\nregulator should not attempt to judge commercial merit,  but  in\r\n\r\nsome  instances it may have non-commercial grounds  to  conclude\r\n\r\nthat  a proposal is not in the public interest. For example,  it\r\n\r\nmay  have  reasonable  cause  to  doubt  the  integrity  of  the\r\n\r\ndirectors or major shareholders of a listing applicant.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIn   such  cases,  it  may  consider  disapproving  the  listing\r\n\r\nproposal. We too need to develop such safeguard mechanisms.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained MAS' position with regard to approving\r\n\r\nlisting applications in order to clarify what a disclosure-based\r\n\r\nregime  means, and not to comment on the specific case  of  Mid-Continent.  MAS will evolve its regulatory style to  allow  more\r\n\r\nfree  play  in  the market. But it will not lower  standards  of\r\n\r\nintegrity,  or  allow our financial markets to be  brought  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute through manipulation and sharp practice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as\r\n\r\nthe Deputy Prime Minister has said that he would not comment  on\r\n\r\nthe case, I would not ask about the case.  May I ask him whether\r\n\r\nhe  could  explain  what  are the rules  and  penalties  against\r\n\r\nmanipulation of shares?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, I believe manipulation of\r\n\r\nshares is a criminal offence and one can go to jail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>HUMANITARIAN AID AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TO INDONESIA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  whether  the  Singapore  Government  will  review  its\r\n\r\nhumanitarian aid and financial assistance to Indonesia  in  view\r\n\r\nof  the unfavourable comments and doubts expressed by Indonesian\r\n\r\nPresident B.J.

We have a vested\r\n\r\ninterest   in  Indonesia's  stability,  growth  and  prosperity.\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is a close neighbour and a major trading partner.  We\r\n\r\nhave  large  investments  in Indonesia. An  Indonesian  collapse\r\n\r\nwould hurt Singapore as well as affect the regional economic and\r\n\r\ninvestment climate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also pointed out that because Singapore\r\n\r\nis  a  small country, our capacity to help Indonesia is limited.\r\n\r\nBut we are committed to helping our neighbours within our means,\r\n\r\nso  that  Indonesia and the region can recover from the  present\r\n\r\ncrisis as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sitting on 1st June 1998, the Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhad  informed  Members that the Singapore  Government  would  be\r\n\r\nproceeding  with humanitarian aid to Indonesia as  well  as  the\r\n\r\nproposed Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee (BTFG) scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 6th July 1998, the Singapore Government\r\n\r\nannounced  that it would provide humanitarian aid  in  rice  and\r\n\r\nmedicine  worth  S$12  million  to  Indonesia.   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nIndonesian  officials  have started  work  on  implementing  the\r\n\r\nassistance.  Minister  for Education  and  Second  Minister  for\r\n\r\nDefence, RAdm (NS) Teo Chee Hean, visited Indonesia from 5th-7th\r\n\r\nAugust 1998 to deliver the first shipment of humanitarian aid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian Minister of Defence and Security/ABRI Commander,\r\n\r\nGen.  Wiranto,  received the humanitarian aid on behalf  of  the\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Government  at a hand-over ceremony  on  6th  August\r\n\r\n1998. In his speech, Gen. Wiranto expressed his appreciation and\r\n\r\ngratitude to Singapore, and described the handing-over  ceremony\r\n\r\nas  a  milestone in strengthening the ties of friendship between\r\n\r\nthe two nations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th August 1998, just before Minister Teo's visit to\r\n\r\nIndonesia, the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) had published an\r\n\r\ninterview  with  President Habibie, covering Indonesia-Singapore\r\n\r\nrelations. It quoted President Habibie as saying that \"a  friend\r\n\r\nin  need  is  a  friend indeed. I don't have that  feeling  from\r\n\r\nSingapore\",  and  that  \"There  are  211  million   people   (in\r\n\r\nIndonesia). Look at that map. All the green (area) is Indonesia.\r\n\r\nAnd that red dot is Singapore. Look at that.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Teo's visit to Indonesia was planned and scheduled\r\n\r\nearlier.  It  was  not  made in response to President  Habibie's\r\n\r\ncomments  to the AWSJ. Minister Teo called on President  Habibie\r\n\r\non 6th August 1998.  President Habibie repeated to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister  Teo  what he had said to the AWSJ. But  he  also  told\r\n\r\nMinister  Teo that he had a vested interest in maintaining  good\r\n\r\nSingapore-Indonesia  relations.  He  thanked  Minister  Teo  for\r\n\r\nSingapore's humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, other Indonesian officials have expressed\r\n\r\ntheir  appreciation.  The Indonesian media  has  also  generally\r\n\r\nreported  favourably on our humanitarian assistance.  Kompas,  a\r\n\r\nmajor  Indonesian daily, on 12th August 1998 referred to  it  as\r\n\r\nevidence \"that our bilateral relations remain in a good state\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  Indonesian officials are  now  working  out  the\r\n\r\ndetails of the second delivery of aid.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the proposed Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee\r\n\r\nScheme,  we  remain prepared to proceed with the scheme,  as  we\r\n\r\nbelieve   it  can  help  to  restore  confidence  in  Indonesia.\r\n\r\nSingapore officials held the first meeting with their Indonesian\r\n\r\ncounterparts  in  April. The Indonesian officials  said  at  the\r\n\r\nmeeting  that they would have to study the proposal  in  greater\r\n\r\ndetail.   In  his recent Jakarta trip, Minister Teo agreed  with\r\n\r\nCoordinating   Minister  for  Economy,  Finance  and   Industry,\r\n\r\nGinandjar  Kartasasmita, that officials from both  sides  should\r\n\r\ncontinue discussions on the BTFG.

The assistance  that  we\r\n\r\ncan  give  through  loans,  grants and  humanitarian  aid  would\r\n\r\nnaturally be limited.  Singapore should focus on areas where our\r\n\r\nhelp can be most effective.  This would principally be in giving\r\n\r\ntechnical  training, helping local companies establish  economic\r\n\r\nactivities   in  these  countries,  and  offering   humanitarian\r\n\r\nassistance  where  the situation requires.   These  are  already\r\n\r\nadequately covered by well-established mechanisms.  There is  no\r\n\r\nneed to start yet another development assistance programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore provides training and transfer of technical\r\n\r\nexpertise  to countries in the region through the Singapore  Co-operation  Programme  (SCP), administered  by  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs.  It comprises of two programmes,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nThird-Country Training Programme and the Technical  Co-operation\r\n\r\nProgramme.   Approximately  S$16.25  million  has  already  been\r\n\r\nallocated to the Singapore Co-operation Programme this  year,  a\r\n\r\nconsiderable  portion  of  which  has  been  channelled  towards\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Vietnam.

In   1997    alone,\r\n\r\napproximately 800 public officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, the\r\n\r\nPhilippines, Thailand and Vietnam benefited from this programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also provides help through the Regionalisation\r\n\r\nAssistance  Schemes  administered by  the  Economic  Development\r\n\r\nBoard  for  local  companies venturing  into  the  region.

The aim is  to  provide\r\n\r\nselective aid in the form of economic incentives - mainly grants\r\n\r\nand  financing  schemes  -  for local enterprises  to  undertake\r\n\r\nmeaningful   and   viable   development   projects   and   other\r\n\r\ninvestments.

With   the\r\n\r\nliberalization, bankrupts are also encouraged to work towards an\r\n\r\nearly  discharge.   The  law  was also  amended  to  enable  the\r\n\r\nOfficial  Assignee to discharge more bankrupts  by  certificate.\r\n\r\nFurther  studies are currently being undertaken to determine  if\r\n\r\nadditional changes are necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also appointed a Corporate Finance\r\n\r\nCommittee  under  the Financial Sector Review  Group,  which  is\r\n\r\ncurrently looking into ways to facilitate the listing of  start-ups  on  the  stock exchange.

As  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of 1997, there was over $7.7 billion worth of  venture\r\n\r\ncapital  funds  managed  in Singapore.  Currently,  these  funds\r\n\r\nenjoy  tax  exemption on the gains from disposal of investments,\r\n\r\nand on certain investment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  To\r\n\r\nfurther encourage the growth of the venture capital industry,  I\r\n\r\nhave  announced in this year's Budget Statement that the current\r\n\r\n10-year limit will be extended, on a case-by-case basis,  by  up\r\n\r\nto a further five years, at a concessionary tax rate of not more\r\n\r\nthan  10%.  This will encourage venture capital funds to take  a\r\n\r\nlonger-term  perspective of their investments  and  to  minimize\r\n\r\npremature divestment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also established a $50 million\r\n\r\nTechnology Development Fund (TDF) which co-invests with  private\r\n\r\nventure  capital  firms  to fund early  stage  ventures.   Other\r\n\r\nsimilar    funds    include   the   $100   million    Technology\r\n\r\nCommercialization  Fund and the $100 million Pharmaceutical  and\r\n\r\nBiotechnology  Growth  Fund.   EDB  Investments   Pte   Ltd,   a\r\n\r\nsubsidiary of the Economic Development Board, also runs  venture\r\n\r\ncapital  funds  that  invest in start-up  companies  at  various\r\n\r\nstages of development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the concern on the avenues open to local enterprises\r\n\r\nto  develop  partnerships with GLCs, I would like to  point  out\r\n\r\nthat  GLCs  have  been forming partnerships with  smaller  local\r\n\r\nenterprises for regional projects.  However, the test is in  the\r\n\r\ndegree of complementarity between the specific needs of the GLCs\r\n\r\nand  the capabilities of the SMEs.  We should not force  a  pace\r\n\r\nbeyond what commercial reality dictates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also been facilitating the development\r\n\r\nof   partnerships   between  the  GLCs  and  smaller   Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies.   An example is through the business interaction  and\r\n\r\nnetworking  made  possible  at  Trade  Development  Board  trade\r\n\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLC/SME partnerships are already beginning to happen on the\r\n\r\nground.

Unemployment is traditionally  high  in\r\n\r\nJune as this is the period that the new local tertiary graduates\r\n\r\njoin  the  ranks  of job seekers.  An estimated  62,100  persons\r\n\r\n(seasonally  unadjusted  figure) were unemployed  in  June  1998\r\n\r\ncompared with 36,500 in March 1998 and 45,500 a year ago.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Service Department of the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  registered about 1,500 to 1,700 new  job  seekers  per\r\n\r\nmonth in recent months.

This variable component now constitutes\r\n\r\n16%  of  total  wages.   In the unionised sector,  the  variable\r\n\r\ncomponent  is  20%.  This provides a cushion  for  companies  to\r\n\r\nreduce wage costs in difficult times.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC recommendation for 1998 is wage restraint. It was\r\n\r\nformulated  in  May, when the forecast for economic  growth  was\r\n\r\n2.5%-4.5%  for  the  year. Since then the regional  outlook  has\r\n\r\ndeteriorated.   We now expect the economy to grow  by  0.5%-1.5%\r\n\r\nfor  this year. The figure is still positive, but this does  not\r\n\r\ntruly reflect current reality.  In a rapidly changing situation,\r\n\r\nquarter-on-quarter  figures  give a  better  indication  of  the\r\n\r\ndirection of the economy, although they are more volatile.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarter-on-quarter basis, seasonally adjusted growth\r\n\r\nwas only +0.3% in the first quarter, and was -1.7% in the second\r\n\r\nquarter.   We  can expect very weak or negative growth  for  the\r\n\r\nrest of the year and next year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These difficult economic conditions are already being\r\n\r\nreflected  in  wage  settlements.  My Ministry's  data  on  wage\r\n\r\nsettlement  achieved  so far showed that  the  weighted  average\r\n\r\nbasic  wage increase up to July this year is only 2.5%, compared\r\n\r\nto   5.9%  last  year.   The  average  increase  agreed  between\r\n\r\nmanagement  and unions has progressively dropped  since  January\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NTUC data paint the same picture. NTUC has reported\r\n\r\nthat  over  the  last two months, 48 companies  employing  4,490\r\n\r\nworkers settled for a wage freeze, out of which one company  had\r\n\r\na  wage cut.  Many more requests for wage freeze are now on  the\r\n\r\nnegotiating table.  NTUC expects that for the year as  a  whole,\r\n\r\nthe average basic wage increase will only be 1.5%-2.5%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, variable payments are likely to be cut.\r\n\r\nNTUC  expects bonuses, including the Annual Wage Supplement,  to\r\n\r\naverage  1.0-1.3 months this year, down from the 2.3  months  on\r\n\r\naverage that were paid out last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, total wages are likely to decrease by 5%-8%\r\n\r\nthis   year,   compared  to  last  year.  This  is  a   valuable\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  cutting business costs, and helping  firms  to\r\n\r\nremain viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flexi-wage scheme is therefore working. Union leaders\r\n\r\nhave been very\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nresponsible,   moderating  the  expectations  of   members   and\r\n\r\nnegotiating  realistic settlements. Many companies  are  already\r\n\r\nexercising  not just wage restraint, but severe wage  restraint.\r\n\r\nThis  is a prudent interpretation of the NWC recommendations  in\r\n\r\nthe present circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is whether flexi-wage adjustments alone\r\n\r\nwill  be  enough. Flexi-wages are effective for making  firm-by-firm  adjustments, when individual companies are in  difficulty.\r\n\r\nBut  if we need to lower wages across-the-board, as part  of  an\r\n\r\noverall   reduction  in  our  business  costs,  then  flexi-wage\r\n\r\nadjustments  may need to be supplemented by a cut in  employers'\r\n\r\nCPF contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has altered the competitive landscape.\r\n\r\nMany  Asian  countries have seen large currency depreciation  of\r\n\r\n25%-75% against the Singapore dollar.  With unemployment rising,\r\n\r\ntheir  wages  have not increased to compensate for  the  reduced\r\n\r\npurchasing power.  This has sharply reduced their labour  costs,\r\n\r\nand made them more cost-competitive compared to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our electronics exports have lost market share in the US.\r\n\r\nOther  Asian countries have lost market share too, but  by  less\r\n\r\nthan  Singapore.  The retrenchments in our electronics  industry\r\n\r\nare  partly  caused  by companies shifting production  to  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  including Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.   This\r\n\r\ngoes  beyond the normal process of industry upgrading. It  is  a\r\n\r\nsign  that we are becoming less competitive.  We must watch this\r\n\r\ncarefully, and not allow our manufacturing sector to be hollowed\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Prime Minister said at the National\r\n\r\nDay  Rally,  our  solution  is not to depreciate  the  Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  to  match that of our competitors. That would erode  the\r\n\r\npurchasing  power  of workers' wages, and reduce  the  value  of\r\n\r\nworkers' CPF savings, through higher inflation.  It is better to\r\n\r\nmaintain  a  stable exchange rate, and tackle the components  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  directly, whether they are wages,  rentals  and\r\n\r\nland  prices,  and  Government  taxes  and  charges.   Indeed  I\r\n\r\nunderstand this has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbeen  the  MAS'  policy - to maintain a stable Singapore  dollar\r\n\r\nexchange  rate,  but  within flexible limits  that  reflect  our\r\n\r\neconomic fundamentals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a trade-weighted basis, the Singapore\r\n\r\ndollar  exchange rate has risen only slightly since  the  crisis\r\n\r\nbegan,  particularly  if we discount the  effect  of  the  large\r\n\r\ndepreciation of the Indonesian rupiah.  The purchasing power  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore dollar has been maintained, as seen in  our  very\r\n\r\nlow consumer price inflation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will reconvene the National Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  to  update  their  recommendations  in  the  light   of\r\n\r\ndevelopments  since May, and issue new wage guidelines  to  help\r\n\r\nthe economy cope with the continuing crisis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry is currently studying\r\n\r\nall   components  of  costs  in  Singapore  to   establish   how\r\n\r\ncompetitive we are in this changed situation, and what  we  must\r\n\r\ndo to strengthen or restore our competitiveness.  This will be a\r\n\r\nmajor  focus  of  the  report of the  Committee  on  Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness, chaired by Mr Lee Yock Suan.  The  report  will\r\n\r\nbe  ready  before  the end of the year.  In an overall  plan  to\r\n\r\nreduce costs, wages will have to bear its share of the reduction\r\n\r\nthrough the flexi-wage adjustments and, if necessary, a CPF cut.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister what are the chances of not having a CPF cut this year?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, in a nutshell, a cut in the\r\n\r\nemployers'  CPF next year is very likely, but we  will  have  to\r\n\r\nwait   for   the  report  from  the  Committee  on   Singapore's\r\n\r\nCompetitiveness to make its full recommendation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  whether the Government is  taking  steps  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  employers do their fair share to see  an  economic\r\n\r\nturnaround  instead of taking the easy way out by cutting  wages\r\n\r\nor cutting employers' CPF contribution.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> As I have explained in my answer, it is\r\n\r\nnot just a question of cutting wages.  Government will also make\r\n\r\na  comprehensive review of all taxes, rates and levies  to  help\r\n\r\nminimise  cost of business in Singapore.  At the same  time,  it\r\n\r\nstands to reason that employers faced with this crisis will also\r\n\r\nbe  examining  their  business  strategy,  re-engineering  their\r\n\r\nbusiness operations, for instance, looking for new product  mix,\r\n\r\nin  order  to survive this crisis.   They will have to look  for\r\n\r\nnew  markets and in their efforts, they will receive  additional\r\n\r\nsupport from Government.

In the case of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who want to invest abroad and to find  new  places\r\n\r\nwhere they can invest, Government will also provide the kind  of\r\n\r\nsupport  to help them reach out to new locations where they  can\r\n\r\ninvest to continue their business.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my question has\r\n\r\npartly  been  asked  by  Mr  Rai.

Then why is there  a  need  to\r\n\r\nreconvene the NWC?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, when the NWC made its recommendation\r\n\r\nthis year, it was through a series of deliberations in April and\r\n\r\nMay.   The  situation  then  was very different.   The  regional\r\n\r\ncrisis has got worse over this period, between May and now.   In\r\n\r\nfact, the regional crisis has not bottomed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nout  yet.  Changes are still taking place almost on a day-by-day\r\n\r\nbasis.   Malaysia has just introduced exchange  control,  as  Mr\r\n\r\nChiam has mentioned.  This is a sign of the seriousness of their\r\n\r\neconomic  problem.  And as the Prime Minister had  said  at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Day  Rally,  when there are economic  difficulties  in\r\n\r\nMalaysia, it will have a serious impact on Singapore.   We  will\r\n\r\nbe  affected  when they have difficulties.  Likewise,  Indonesia\r\n\r\ncontinues to face serious economic difficulties.  A shortage  of\r\n\r\nessential  food  supply  continues to cause  social  unrest  and\r\n\r\ncreate  problems of law and order.  This year and the next  year\r\n\r\nwill therefore be very difficult years for Singapore.  There  is\r\n\r\na  real  likelihood  that  we  will  end  up  with  much  higher\r\n\r\nunemployment than we have experienced since the mid-80s.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing business costs, including wage cost, will help our\r\n\r\ncompanies to weather this crisis.  It will help us to reduce job\r\n\r\nlosses though it may not lead to a quick recovery because we are\r\n\r\nsuffering  largely  from  the impact  of  the  regional  crisis.\r\n\r\nHence,  I think it is necessary at this juncture for us to  take\r\n\r\nanother  look  at  our wage policy.  So by  reconvening  NWC  to\r\n\r\nreview  its recommendations made in May this year will give  the\r\n\r\ntrade unions representing the workers and the employers who  are\r\n\r\ncomponent  parties  of the NWC to re-examine the  whole  changed\r\n\r\nenvironment and come to a new consensus on how we could  improve\r\n\r\nour wage competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, may I ask how soon\r\n\r\nwill  the  NWC  be  reconvened and what is top  on  the  agenda,\r\n\r\nwhether it is a CPF cut or implementing a wage freeze?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will try to get the reconvening of\r\n\r\nNWC  settled as soon as possible.

West Malaysian CPF members are distinguished  from\r\n\r\nother  foreign  CPF  members because  of  the  historical  links\r\n\r\nbetween\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPeninsular Malaysia and Singapore.  Geographic proximity enabled\r\n\r\nmany  West  Malaysian  workers  to  shuttle  frequently  between\r\n\r\nPeninsular  Malaysia  and  Singapore.   West  Malaysians   often\r\n\r\nreturned  to  Singapore to work after a period of  absence  from\r\n\r\nSingapore.   This  was unlike other foreigners, including  those\r\n\r\nfrom East Malaysia, who were fewer in number and seldom returned\r\n\r\nto work after they had left.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Malaysian CPF members, in fact, are given preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment  over  Singapore members.   Apart  from  enjoying  the\r\n\r\nprivilege   of   tax-exemptions  on  their  CPF  savings,   West\r\n\r\nMalaysians  can  withdraw their full CPF savings  from  age  50,\r\n\r\nwithout having to set aside the minimum sum, provided that  they\r\n\r\nhave not worked in Singapore for at least two years prior to the\r\n\r\nwithdrawal request.  Singaporeans can only withdraw their CPF at\r\n\r\nthe  age  of  55,  and after they have set aside the  prevailing\r\n\r\nminimum sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF funds belong to individual account holders and not\r\n\r\nto  governments.  There is no question that the CPF  savings  of\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysians  will  always belong  to  the  West  Malaysians\r\n\r\nthemselves.  Only individual West Malaysians can withdraw  their\r\n\r\nown  CPF  savings  when  they  meet  the  age  criteria.   Their\r\n\r\ncontributions were made in accordance with the prevailing  rules\r\n\r\nand  withdrawal conditions that have been in place  since  1971.\r\n\r\nAll  workers  in Singapore, including those from West  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwere  well  aware  of  these rules upon assuming  employment  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   They  are therefore bound by the  withdrawal  rules\r\n\r\nthat  they  had  accepted  when  they  first  came  to  work  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  From 1st August 1995, all foreigners, including West\r\n\r\nMalaysians,  were not required to contribute to  CPF.   However,\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysians who have savings accumulated before  this  date\r\n\r\nmust continue to be subject to the prevailing withdrawal rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Prime Minister\r\n\r\nDr  Mahathir Mohamad discussed a framework for wider cooperation\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  Malaysia, including changes in CPF withdrawal criteria  for\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysians.   Although they have held further  discussions\r\n\r\nsince  then,  they  have not yet reached  an  agreement  on  the\r\n\r\nframework for wider cooperation.  Once an agreement is  reached,\r\n\r\nthis issue will be resolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Malaysian Minister of Human Resources wrote\r\n\r\nto  me  to  enquire  on  this matter.  I  have  replied  to  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian Minister to explain that the matter should be left  to\r\n\r\nthe  two  Prime Ministers when they resume their discussions  on\r\n\r\nbilateral cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, did the Ministry receive any\r\n\r\nfeedback  from West Malaysian workers that they prefer to  leave\r\n\r\ntheir savings with the CPF?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> While my Ministry did not receive such\r\n\r\ndirect feedback, I understand that there had been calls made  to\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  by  West  Malaysian workers who  have  expressed  the\r\n\r\nsentiment that they prefer very much to leave their savings with\r\n\r\nthe CPF than for it to be repatriated back.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  response would be to  Malaysia's  attempt  to\r\n\r\nbring  this  matter  to  the International  Labour  Organisation\r\n\r\n(ILO).\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a Question for\r\n\r\nWritten Answer on this subject.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Boundaries and Survey Maps Act and the\r\n\r\nLandmarks   Act  were  enacted  long  ago  in  1884   and   1882\r\n\r\nrespectively.   The Bill seeks to repeal both Acts  and  to  re-enact  them  as  a  single new Act.  This new Act  will  contain\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the  two Acts that are still relevant  and  also\r\n\r\nintroduce new provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Act will primarily (1) facilitate the adoption\r\n\r\nof  modern  surveying technology; (2) legalise  survey  maps  in\r\n\r\nelectronic  form  to  reflect  the  computerisation  of   survey\r\n\r\nrecords;  (3) define the powers and duties of the Chief Surveyor\r\n\r\nwho will administer the new Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill empowers the Chief Surveyor to\r\n\r\nestablish  and maintain a coordinated cadastre. Currently,  land\r\n\r\nparcels  are  defined by boundaries represented by bearings  and\r\n\r\ndistances  with  reference  to  boundary  marks.   This  is  old\r\n\r\ntechnology.   The Survey Department has shifted to  the  use  of\r\n\r\nsatellite technology or Global Positioning System.  This  modern\r\n\r\ntechnology  allows boundaries to be demarcated and defined  more\r\n\r\naccurately.   For  the shift, the Chief Surveyor  will  need  to\r\n\r\nestablish  and maintain a legalised set of boundary points  with\r\n\r\nprecise   coordinates   called   coordinated   cadastre.     The\r\n\r\ncoordinates  of  the cadastre will act as reference  points  for\r\n\r\ndefining land parcels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Surveyor will convert existing areas already\r\n\r\nsurveyed to the coordinated cadastre within five years,  ie,  by\r\n\r\nYear  2004.   Section 7 of the new Act provides for the  gazette\r\n\r\ndeclaration of these areas as and when they are converted.   The\r\n\r\nconversion  will only define existing land lots more accurately.\r\n\r\nIt will not affect their land areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survey Department has completed the computerisation of\r\n\r\nsurvey  data.   Maps are now being maintained electronically  in\r\n\r\ngraphic databases in computers.  It is timely to recognise  such\r\n\r\nelectronic maps.  This will pave the way for electronic commerce\r\n\r\nof electronic survey records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 make the Survey Department responsible for\r\n\r\nadministering the new Act and provide for the appointment of the\r\n\r\nChief  Surveyor by the Minister.  Under the new Act,  the  Chief\r\n\r\nSurveyor will:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Conduct cadastral survey of any land parcel;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Establish, protect, maintain, repair, alter or remove\r\n\r\nsurvey control marks on any land parcel;\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Inspect and verify the accuracy of cadastral surveys\r\n\r\nsubmitted by registered surveyors;  and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Assign lot numbers, maintain survey records and make\r\n\r\navailable such records and plans at prescribed fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 45 sections in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act\r\n\r\ncatering  for  the  survey of all lands  in  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\npublication of the maps.  By October 1978, every land parcel was\r\n\r\nsystematically  demarcated, surveyed and their  maps  published.\r\n\r\nThe  Chief  Surveyor  has identified 33 of the  45  sections  as\r\n\r\nredundant.   These  33  redundant  sections  will  therefore  be\r\n\r\nexcluded from the new Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, all 16 sections of the Landmarks Act are\r\n\r\nredundant  and  should  be repealed.    The  Landmarks  Act  was\r\n\r\nenacted  in  1882 to provide for the establishment of  landmarks\r\n\r\nused to define the boundaries of  land lots.  The new Boundaries\r\n\r\nand  Survey  Maps Act has catered for land lots to be demarcated\r\n\r\nby boundary marks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consequential amendment arising from the substitution of\r\n\r\nthe  definition of \"title survey\" to \"cadastral survey\"  in  the\r\n\r\nnew Act will also be made to the Land Surveyors Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

The\r\n\r\npresence  of illegal immigrants will pose a serious  social  and\r\n\r\nsecurity  problem,  and compromise the safety  and  security  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.    We have therefore taken, and will  continue  to\r\n\r\ntake, a tough stand against all immigration offenders - be  they\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants,  their  smugglers,  overstayers,   or   the\r\n\r\nharbourers and employers of such people - especially  given  the\r\n\r\ncurrent regional economic situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since early this year, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) has\r\n\r\nstepped  up  patrols in our waters to deter and  arrest  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.     The   Police  and  Singapore   Immigration   and\r\n\r\nRegistration  (SIR)  have also raided  hideouts  and  haunts  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  flush out immigration offenders.     Joint  raids\r\n\r\nwere also conducted with the Ministry of Manpower in the service\r\n\r\nand  manufacturing sectors, for example, at food courts,  hawker\r\n\r\ncentres  and  factories.    These raids  have  resulted  in  the\r\n\r\narrests of 9,449 illegal immigrants and 5,425 overstayers in the\r\n\r\nfirst  seven  months of 1998 alone, compared  to  7,599  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants and 6,314 overstayers for the whole of 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enforcement measures must be backed up by tough laws\r\n\r\nand  strict  penalties  for those who have  committed  offences.\r\n\r\nMy  Ministry  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  review  of  the\r\n\r\npenalties for the various types of immigration offences.   While\r\n\r\nwe  found  existing  penalties to  be  generally  adequate,  the\r\n\r\npenalties for some offences need to be enhanced to enable us  to\r\n\r\neffectively  deal  with  the illegal  immigrant  problem.    The\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act  has  to be amended to  give  effect  to  these\r\n\r\nenhanced penalties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(i)  Attempted illegal entry and departure</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, attempted illegal entry and departure attract\r\n\r\npenalties which are less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsevere  than  those  for  actual illegal  entry  and  departure.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  penalty for illegal entry is a maximum  six  months'\r\n\r\njail  and  mandatory  caning  of a minimum  three  strokes,  the\r\n\r\npenalty  for the attempted illegal entry offence is imprisonment\r\n\r\nof  between three months and two years and a fine of $4,000, but\r\n\r\nno  caning.    For illegal departure, the penalty is  a  maximum\r\n\r\n$2,000  fine  and  six  months'  jail,  while  the  penalty  for\r\n\r\nattempted  illegal departure is a maximum $2,000 fine and  three\r\n\r\nmonths' jail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to equate the penalties for attempted\r\n\r\nillegal entry or departure to the penalties for illegal entry or\r\n\r\ndeparture  respectively because there is no reason to  treat  an\r\n\r\nunsuccessful  act of illegal entry or departure  more  leniently\r\n\r\nthan  a  successful one.    Clauses 3 and 4(a) of the Bill  will\r\n\r\namend  sections  5  and 6 to make attempted  illegal  entry  and\r\n\r\nattempted  illegal departure punishable with the same  penalties\r\n\r\nas illegal entry and illegal departure.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(ii)  Abetment of illegal entry</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smugglers of illegal immigrants bring the illegal\r\n\r\nimmigration problem to Singapore and therefore have to be  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  severely.    Currently, those  convicted  of  engaging  in\r\n\r\nthe business  of conveying prohibited immigrants into Singapore can\r\n\r\nbe  jailed  between  two and five years and  caned  a  mandatory\r\n\r\nminimum of three strokes.    Although this penalty is adequately\r\n\r\nsevere, in reality, many traffickers, boatmen and runners caught\r\n\r\nsmuggling  illegal  immigrants  escape  punishment  under   this\r\n\r\nsection.    Instead, they are charged with abetment  of  illegal\r\n\r\nentry.   This is because it is, in practice, difficult to obtain\r\n\r\nevidence  showing  that  the traffickers  have  engaged  in  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  of smuggling illegal immigrants.    As abettors,  they\r\n\r\nare  liable  to be jailed between six months and two  years  and\r\n\r\nfined up to $6,000, but do not receive corporal punishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me relate an actual example to illustrate the point I\r\n\r\nam  making.    On  7th May 1998 at 3.30 am, Police  Coast  Guard\r\n\r\nintercepted a fast-moving sampan, fitted with a 200 hp  outboard\r\n\r\nengine, at sea off\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChangi  while it was proceeding from Batam towards Pulau Tekong.\r\n\r\nThere  were  two  boat  operators and three  passengers  in  the\r\n\r\nsampan.   None of them possessed valid travel documents and they\r\n\r\nwere  all  arrested.    The two boat operators were  charged  as\r\n\r\nabettors,  and  sentenced  to seven months'  imprisonment  each.\r\n\r\nThe  three  passengers  were charged  for  attempting  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore illegally, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment\r\n\r\neach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boat operators could not be charged as traffickers\r\n\r\nbecause we did not have adequate proof that they were engaged in\r\n\r\nthe  business  of  conveying illegal  immigrants  to  Singapore.\r\n\r\nUnder  our proposal to equate the penalty for attempted  illegal\r\n\r\nentry  to  the  penalty for illegal entry, caning for  attempted\r\n\r\nillegal entry will become mandatory for the passengers.   But it\r\n\r\nis  absurd  that  the  passengers are caned under  the  proposed\r\n\r\namendments while those who facilitated their illegal entry,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe boat operators, are not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more effective to tackle the problem at source, and\r\n\r\ndeter   the   conveyance  of  illegal  immigrants  to  Singapore\r\n\r\naltogether.  Besides, these so-called \"abettors\" are  as  guilty\r\n\r\nin   bringing  in  illegal  immigrants  as  those  convicted  as\r\n\r\nsmugglers.   Therefore, deterrent penalties have to be  imposed.\r\n\r\nTo  ensure  that  these  smugglers do not  escape  the  corporal\r\n\r\npunishment  meted  out  to  those convicted  of  trafficking  in\r\n\r\nillegal immigrants, we propose that the penalty for abetment  of\r\n\r\nillegal  entry be amended to include mandatory caning.   Clauses\r\n\r\n11(b)  and  (d) of the Bill amend section 57(1) of  the  Act  to\r\n\r\nprovide  that abettors of illegal entry under section 6 will  be\r\n\r\npunished with a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the  cane,\r\n\r\nin  addition to the existing penalty of between six  months  and\r\n\r\ntwo years' jail.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(iii)  Employment of immigration offenders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers of immigration offenders should also be severely\r\n\r\ndealt  with.   This is because if employers do  not  offer  them\r\n\r\njobs,  illegal  immigrants will not  be  attracted  to  come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employers of more than five immigration\r\n\r\noffenders can be sentenced to between six months and two  years'\r\n\r\njail, fined not exceeding $6,000 and caned.  Clause 11(c) of the\r\n\r\nBill  amends  section 57(1B) of the Act to increase the  maximum\r\n\r\nfine  for employers of more than five immigration offenders  who\r\n\r\ncannot  be caned because they are females or more than 50  years\r\n\r\nold from $6,000 to $10,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate bodies which employ immigration offenders are\r\n\r\nfined  between  $50,000 and $100,000 in lieu of  mandatory  jail\r\n\r\nsentences  or caning on conviction.  In addition, an officer  of\r\n\r\nthe company who approves the employment is personally liable  to\r\n\r\nbe   prosecuted   for  the  offence  of  employing   immigration\r\n\r\noffenders.   He is liable, on conviction, to the same  penalties\r\n\r\nfor   employing  immigration  offenders.   Clause  11(f)  amends\r\n\r\nsection  57(2A)  to  increase  the  default  fines  in  lieu  of\r\n\r\nmandatory  jail  or  caning for corporate  bodies  convicted  of\r\n\r\nemploying immigration offenders to between $100,000 and $200,000\r\n\r\nto maintain the deterrent effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rebuttable Presumption for Attempted Illegal Entry</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the proposed introduction of a\r\n\r\npresumption clause for attempted illegal entry under  section  6\r\n\r\nof  the Immigration Act.  Illegal immigrants arriving by sea and\r\n\r\nwho  are  caught in our territorial waters before they disembark\r\n\r\nfrom   their  vessels  are  not  considered  to  have  \"entered\"\r\n\r\nSingapore  within the meaning of the current provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nAct.  Although they can be charged with attempted illegal entry,\r\n\r\nthere  is a problem of proof of intent as the illegal immigrant,\r\n\r\nwhen  caught, usually claims that he has no intention  to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Added to this is the problem created by the right of\r\n\r\ntransit under international law.  These illegal immigrants often\r\n\r\nclaim  that  they are exercising their right of transit  through\r\n\r\nSingapore  waters  as a legal defence.  Short of  a  confession,\r\n\r\nthere is often no way to rebut their claim.  By relying on  such\r\n\r\na defence, the illegal immigrants can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncreate  a  reasonable doubt as to whether they had  intended  to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore  illegally.  Such evidential difficulties  have\r\n\r\nmade  it  difficult for the Police to prove such cases beyond  a\r\n\r\nreasonable   doubt  as  required  by  law  and  to  successfully\r\n\r\nprosecute some of these illegal immigrants in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal more effectively with similar cases, my Ministry\r\n\r\nproposes  to introduce a presumption clause in the Act  so  that\r\n\r\nany  foreigner fitting the profile of an illegal immigrant found\r\n\r\nin  our  port waters will be presumed to be attempting to  enter\r\n\r\nSingapore illegally if -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) he does not carry any valid travel document; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he has no visible means of subsistence, eg. inadequate\r\n\r\nfunds or resources for a person's basic upkeep for a week's stay\r\n\r\nin Singapore; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) he has taken precautions to conceal his identity or\r\n\r\npresence  from our Police or Immigration officers, eg. by  lying\r\n\r\nlow in the boats or by travelling at night without a light.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4(b) of the Bill amends section 6 of the Act to\r\n\r\ninsert  subsections (4) and (5) to provide for this  presumption\r\n\r\nclause.   The presumption will assist the prosecution by putting\r\n\r\nthe  onus  on the accused to satisfy the Court that it  is  more\r\n\r\nprobable than not that he was not attempting to enter Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich is a heavier burden than merely raising a reasonable doubt\r\n\r\nthat he was attempting to enter Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate how the presumption clause will be used\r\n\r\nwith  an  example.  On 24th February this year at  2.30  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  the  Police  Coast Guard (PCG)  detected  a  motorised\r\n\r\nsampan  heading  from Batam towards Singapore.  PCG  intercepted\r\n\r\nthe  sampan at the sea off Changi after a short chase.  It found\r\n\r\n10  passengers  and  two boat operators  in  the  sampan.   They\r\n\r\ncarried  with them small amounts of cash in rupiah and  ringgit,\r\n\r\nand did not possess any valid travel documents.  They also tried\r\n\r\nto lie low to escape detection by PCG.  The boat operators and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  passengers were successfully prosecuted in this case.   But\r\n\r\nthe onus was on the prosecution to adduce the necessary evidence\r\n\r\nto  prove  a  prima facie case to the court that  these  accused\r\n\r\npersons  had attempted to enter Singapore illegally.   This  was\r\n\r\ndespite it being patently clear what the intentions of the  boat\r\n\r\noperators  and their passengers were.  On the other  hand,  once\r\n\r\nthe  presumption clause is inserted in the law,  the  burden  of\r\n\r\nproof would then fall on the accused persons to produce evidence\r\n\r\nto satisfy the Court that it is more probable than not that they\r\n\r\nwere not attempting to enter Singapore illegally.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Identification Card for Foreign Workers</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the amendments which are necessary for\r\n\r\nthe  implementation  of  the proposed  identification  card  for\r\n\r\nforeign  workers.  Currently, a work permit holder is  issued  a\r\n\r\nWork  Permit,  with  the  immigration Disembarkation/Embarkation\r\n\r\npass  incorporated  on the reverse side  to  show  that  he  had\r\n\r\nentered Singapore through legal channels.  In addition, a  Visit\r\n\r\nPass  showing  the  permitted duration of stay  granted  by  the\r\n\r\nController  of  Immigration is endorsed  in  the  passport.   To\r\n\r\nprevent  the  worker from absconding, it is common practice  for\r\n\r\nthe  employers  to  hold on to the worker's  passport  and  work\r\n\r\npermit  card,  leaving the worker with only a photocopy  of  his\r\n\r\nwork permit card.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this practice makes it difficult for enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies to identify whether a foreigner is a legitimate  worker\r\n\r\nor  an  illegal  immigrant.  Photocopies  are  usually  of  poor\r\n\r\nquality, and they can be easily forged.  The current work permit\r\n\r\ncard  also does not capture the fingerprints of the holder, thus\r\n\r\nmaking  it  difficult for enforcement agencies  to  conclusively\r\n\r\nidentify  that  the  person carrying the  work  permit  card  is\r\n\r\nactually  the  person identified in the card.  In  addition,  it\r\n\r\ndoes not have adequate security features to prevent forgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these shortcomings, my Ministry and the Manpower\r\n\r\nMinistry will\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  jointly  implementing a new identification card for  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  which will combine the current work permit  card,  the\r\n\r\nDisembarkation/Embarkation card and the  visit  pass.   It  will\r\n\r\ncontain enhanced security features, including the fingerprint of\r\n\r\nthe  foreign worker, and an expiry date that will coincide  with\r\n\r\nthe  expiry  of the work permit and visit pass.  Not  only  will\r\n\r\nthis  new  identification card reduce the likelihood of forgery,\r\n\r\nfingerprint records will also allow our enforcement agencies  to\r\n\r\nmore   conclusively  identify  the  card-holder.   The  proposed\r\n\r\nidentification  card will be implemented in  phases,  commencing\r\n\r\nfrom the end of this year.  More details will be released in due\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill amends section 55(1) of the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act  to  provide  for  the  Minister  to  make  new\r\n\r\nregulations  pertaining to the recording, storage and  retrieval\r\n\r\nof  the  fingerprints, including thumbprints, for  the  proposed\r\n\r\nidentification card for the foreign workers.  These  regulations\r\n\r\nwould  also  empower  law enforcement agencies  when  conducting\r\n\r\nraids  to  demand  finger and thumb prints from persons  holding\r\n\r\nthese  new identity cards for verification purposes.  Since  the\r\n\r\nvisit  pass for work permit holders would no longer be  endorsed\r\n\r\nin  the passport, clause 11(e) will amend section 57 of the  Act\r\n\r\nto  require an employer or harbourer of an immigration  offender\r\n\r\nto  prove  that he had exercised due diligence by  checking  the\r\n\r\noriginal   pass  (which  will  now  be  incorporated  into   the\r\n\r\nidentification  card for work permit holders)  and  ascertaining\r\n\r\nthat  the holder of the passport is the person named in the pass\r\n\r\nor  permit,  before he could rely on the holder's possession  of\r\n\r\nthe  visit  pass  as a legal defence that he did  not  knowingly\r\n\r\nemploy or harbour an immigration offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Amendment Bill also proposes other amendments to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  enforcement actions of Immigration  and  Police\r\n\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Immigration Act currently only empowers the\r\n\r\nController of Immigration to require those seeking to enter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore and those applying for passes and permits to submit to\r\n\r\nmedical  examinations as a condition for  issuing  the  pass  or\r\n\r\npermit.  However, the Controller of Immigration is not empowered\r\n\r\nto  require  those  who  are already holding  valid  passes  and\r\n\r\npermits to undergo medical examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Health's statistics, since\r\n\r\n1993, more than 2,000 foreigners living and working in Singapore\r\n\r\nhave  been  found  to  be HIV-positive.   Their  illnesses  were\r\n\r\ndetected  when  they fell ill or when they applied  to  purchase\r\n\r\ninsurance  policies or when they applied to renew  their  passes\r\n\r\nand permits.  Currently, only new PR and work permit applicants,\r\n\r\nand work permit holders applying to renew their work permits are\r\n\r\nrequired   to   undergo  the  medical  screening  before   their\r\n\r\napplications  are  approved.  From early next  year,  employment\r\n\r\npass  and  other  long-term immigration  pass  holders  will  be\r\n\r\nrequired to undergo medical examination before these passes  are\r\n\r\nissued to them.  The extension of the medical screening to these\r\n\r\ngroups of foreigners will help to keep out foreigners who are  a\r\n\r\npotential  threat to our public health.  More  details  will  be\r\n\r\nannounced later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will amend section 29 of the Act to\r\n\r\nempower  the  Controller of Immigration to  require  holders  of\r\n\r\nentry  permits and passes to undergo medical examination at  any\r\n\r\ntime,  and  for  the  medical records to  be  disclosed  to  the\r\n\r\nController  of Immigration.  Those holders of entry permits  and\r\n\r\npasses  who  refuse to undergo such medical examination  can  be\r\n\r\nfined  a maximum of $2,000 and imprisoned up to six months,  and\r\n\r\nhave their passes revoked.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is necessary so that the Controller can have\r\n\r\naccess  to  medical  information, which will facilitate  him  in\r\n\r\nidentifying and repatriating foreigners with infectious diseases\r\n\r\nwho   are   in  Singapore.   The  proposed  access  to   medical\r\n\r\ninformation   for  the  Controller  will  not  be  confined   to\r\n\r\ninfectious diseases alone.  It will also apply to other medical\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconditions, such as mental illnesses, insofar as a foreigner may\r\n\r\nbe a danger to society as a result of his medical condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, section 49(1) of the Immigration Act currently\r\n\r\nonly  empowers the Controller of Immigration or any  immigration\r\n\r\nofficer authorised by him to seize vessels or vehicles below  76\r\n\r\ntonnes  used  in  the  commission of  any  immigration  offence.\r\n\r\nClause  9 will repeal and re-enact section 49(1) of the  Act  to\r\n\r\nempower  any  Police officer authorised by a Deputy Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Police  to  perform the same function.   This  is  aimed  at\r\n\r\nenhancing  Police's operational efficiency as the  Police  Coast\r\n\r\nGuard has been tasked to police our territorial waters and  deal\r\n\r\nwith  illegal  immigrants  attempting  to  enter  by  sea.    In\r\n\r\npractice, the decision to seize such a vessel is now handled  by\r\n\r\nthe  Police  and  it  is  necessary for Police  officers  to  be\r\n\r\nsimilarly  empowered to authorise such seizures,  thus  avoiding\r\n\r\nany unnecessary delay in handling such cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also amends section 49(1) to make it clear that\r\n\r\nthe  Court's  power  to forfeit a vessel or  vehicle  under  the\r\n\r\nsection  may be invoked notwithstanding that no person has  been\r\n\r\ncharged.   This  latter  amendment is necessary  as  Police  had\r\n\r\nencountered cases where vessels or vehicles were seized but  the\r\n\r\npassengers and operators evaded arrest and could not be charged.\r\n\r\nOn  3rd  March this year, at 2.30 am, for example,  a  speedboat\r\n\r\ncarrying  suspected  illegal immigrants was  pursued  by  a  PCG\r\n\r\npatrol  craft  in  the Johor Bahru Straits and the  two  vessels\r\n\r\nsubsequently collided.  The five persons on board the  speedboat\r\n\r\nwere  seen  jumping  into the sea and swimming  towards  Tanjong\r\n\r\nMurai  shore, which is next to Lim Chu Kang Road and  the  Murai\r\n\r\nReservoir,  before  they escaped into the darkness.     Although\r\n\r\nthe  speedboat was seized and towed back by PCG, it  had  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated as unclaimed property and could not be forfeited because\r\n\r\nno one was charged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 5 will amend section 8(1) of the Act to\r\n\r\nclarify the law relating to a prohibited immigrant by making  it\r\n\r\nclear  that a foreigner who is a member of any of the prohibited\r\n\r\nclasses specified in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsubsection  (3) is a prohibited immigrant within the meaning  of\r\n\r\nthe  section.     Such prohibited classes include  persons  with\r\n\r\nmental  illness  or  infectious  diseases,  and  those  who  are\r\n\r\nprostitutes,   vagrants  and  beggars.      In   addition,   the\r\n\r\nController  can deem any other foreigner who in the  opinion  of\r\n\r\nthe Controller is a member of any of the prohibited classes,  to\r\n\r\nbe a prohibited immigrant.    Clause 8(b) seeks to amend section\r\n\r\n8(3)   to  explicitly  list  anyone  with  the  Acquired  Immune\r\n\r\nDeficiency  Syndrome or infected with the Human Immunodeficiency\r\n\r\nVirus to be a prohibited immigrant and liable to be denied entry\r\n\r\nor  repatriated.  Clause 8 will amend section 38 to create a new\r\n\r\nsubsection (2) to empower an immigration officer to exercise the\r\n\r\npowers  of  a  Police officer under the Criminal Procedure  Code\r\n\r\n(Cap. 68) in relation to investigating seizable offences.   This\r\n\r\nis  necessary to ensure that the immigration officers are  given\r\n\r\nsufficient investigation powers to carry out their duties  under\r\n\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ensuring that we properly manage the inflow, presence\r\n\r\nand  outflow of a large pool of foreign visitors and workers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  be they legal or illegal, is one of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHome  Affairs' greatest challenges.   In managing  this  foreign\r\n\r\npopulation,  we  need  to  strike a  fine  balance  between  our\r\n\r\neconomic  objectives and ensuring that we do not compromise  the\r\n\r\nsense  of  safety  and  security of  Singaporeans.    Since  the\r\n\r\nImmigration  Act  was  last  amended  in  1995,  our   operating\r\n\r\nenvironment  has changed significantly.   The proposals  that  I\r\n\r\nhave  presented  today  are necessary to  ensure  that  the  Act\r\n\r\nremains relevant to our needs, and will help to make Singapore a\r\n\r\nsafer and more secure home for all Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I welcome this Amendment Bill introduced  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for  Home  Affairs to tighten the control  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin  order to maintain peace and order in Singapore.  However,  I\r\n\r\nwish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  urge  the  Government  to\r\n\r\nseriously  consider  relaxing  the  restrictions  on  bona  fide\r\n\r\ntourists   who   come  to  Singapore  through  legal   channels,\r\n\r\nparticularly the tourists from China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the start of the Asian currency crisis, tourist\r\n\r\narrivals  from our traditional sources such as Japan,  Thailand,\r\n\r\nMalaysia and Indonesia have dropped substantially owing  to  the\r\n\r\ninternal economic difficulties of these countries.  The  tourism\r\n\r\nindustry  has  suffered gravely.  Statistics  announced  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Tourism Board (STB) recently revealed that during  the\r\n\r\nfirst  seven months of this year, tourist arrivals have  dropped\r\n\r\nto  just 3,610,495, a drop of 17.6% as compared to the 4,381,664\r\n\r\nfor the same period last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the China market seems to be showing\r\n\r\nexcellent potential. According to the STB, China is among one of\r\n\r\nSingapore's top 12 sources of inbound tourists.  From  the  11th\r\n\r\nranking  in 1996, it has gone up to the 10th ranking last  year,\r\n\r\nand  in the first seven months of this year, it has risen to the\r\n\r\n9th  ranking, with a total of 163,745 visitors, an  increase  of\r\n\r\n13%  from  the same period last year.  With the national  income\r\n\r\ngrowing all the time, more and more people from China will  have\r\n\r\nthe  means  to go on oversea tours.  Because of the geographical\r\n\r\nand  human  affinities between the two countries, Singapore  has\r\n\r\nbecome  one  of their most popular tour destinations.   On  this\r\n\r\naccount, I believe that given more encouragement, the number  of\r\n\r\ntourists  coming from China to Singapore will increase by  leaps\r\n\r\nand  bounds.  This will help to stimulate the dispirited tourism\r\n\r\nindustry  in Singapore, and can accelerate the recovery  of  the\r\n\r\nservice and retail industries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, since the implementation of\r\n\r\nthe new tourist visa regulations for Chinese visitors in 1996 by\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Immigration Department, tourists from China are no\r\n\r\nlonger entitled to the 48-hour visa-free stay in Singapore.   To\r\n\r\nmake  things worse, the authority requires the travel agents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to furnish a $1,000 security deposit for each\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  tourist coming to Singapore when they apply for  a  96-hour  visa to stay in Singapore.  This has resulted in the  loss\r\n\r\nof  many  potential visitors from China, and moreover gives  the\r\n\r\nmistaken  signal that they are not welcomed in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding is certainly detrimental to the development  of\r\n\r\nlong-term bilateral relations between Singapore and China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the $1,000 security deposit is meant to prevent\r\n\r\nChinese visitors from overstaying or absconding, then it is  not\r\n\r\npractical at all.  For this very small number of black sheep who\r\n\r\nare  prepared  to  flout the law, this $1,000 means  nothing  to\r\n\r\nthem. It does not serve any deterrent effect at all.  Why are we\r\n\r\nknocking out everybody with one sweeping blow just because there\r\n\r\nare a couple of black sheep in the flock?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Immigration Department takes about 14\r\n\r\ndays  to  process a visa application for a visitor  from  China.\r\n\r\nAfter  obtaining the original copy of the visa, the travel agent\r\n\r\nwill first of all fax a copy of this visa to its counterpart  in\r\n\r\nChina,  and then send the original copy over to China by courier\r\n\r\nservice.  The whole process, from the time of submission of  the\r\n\r\napplication  to  the time the original visa is received  by  the\r\n\r\ntravel  agent  in  China, takes about one whole  month.   If  we\r\n\r\ncompare  this  standard  of  service  to  the  high  speed   and\r\n\r\nefficiency of the checkpoint at Changi Airport, there is  indeed\r\n\r\na whole world of difference!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, faced with stiff competition, the travel\r\n\r\nagents  normally  will  have to dig into their  own  pockets  to\r\n\r\nfurnish  upfront  the $1,000 security deposit for  each  of  the\r\n\r\ntourists  from  China when they apply for their visas.   Let  us\r\n\r\nmake  a  simple  calculation.  Singapore receives about  250,000\r\n\r\nvisitors  from  China  each year, or an average  of  20,000  per\r\n\r\nmonth.   So  at $1,000 per visitor, the travel industry  has  to\r\n\r\nactivate  $20  million of their capital each month  as  security\r\n\r\ndeposit  for  their Chinese visitors.  Although the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment has made some administrative adjustment to reduce the\r\n\r\namount of the security deposit by half,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith effect from the 1st of this month, the revised amount still\r\n\r\nstands  at  $10  million.   Now, with an  increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nChinese  tourists visiting Singapore, the huge  amount  of  bank\r\n\r\nguarantees  \"stuck\"  with the security deposits  will  certainly\r\n\r\naffect  the  cash-flow  and business operations  of  the  travel\r\n\r\nindustry.   In  this present time of economic  difficulty,  this\r\n\r\nmeasure  adopted by the Immigration Department is really rubbing\r\n\r\nsalt into the wounds of the travel industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, only government officials from China are\r\n\r\nexempted  from  visa requirement for up to  48  hours'  stay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But the period of 48 hours is apparently too  short.\r\n\r\nWhen  the Chinese government officials come to Singapore,  apart\r\n\r\nfrom official duties, they also hope to take the opportunity  to\r\n\r\nspend  some  time  touring Singapore.  Some of these  government\r\n\r\nofficials  approached  the  local travel  agents  to  assist  in\r\n\r\napplying  for extension of their stay in Singapore.   But  there\r\n\r\nwas nothing the travel agents could do to assist them.  From the\r\n\r\nbusiness point of view, this is a great pity because business is\r\n\r\nbrought right up to their door-step. Yet, they could not benefit\r\n\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since Singapore wants to develop itself\r\n\r\ninto an international metropolis, it should have the magnanimity\r\n\r\nand  openness of an international metropolis.  As such,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  the Ministry of Home Affairs would reconsider this  matter\r\n\r\nand grant visitors from China the facilities of obtaining a visa\r\n\r\non  arrival,  or even to exempt them from the visa  requirement.\r\n\r\nIn  the  meantime, may I suggest that the Immigration Department\r\n\r\nremove  the  requirement for travel agents to furnish  a  $1,000\r\n\r\nsecurity deposit for each visitor from China.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people may say that since Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  are  required  to apply for a Chinese  visa  to  enter\r\n\r\nChina,  then the Singapore Government has to adopt a  reciprocal\r\n\r\narrangement  for all PRC nationals to have a Singapore  visa  to\r\n\r\nenter  Singapore.  In my view, as an open metropolis,  Singapore\r\n\r\ndoes  not  need  to  conduct itself in this  manner.   Moreover,\r\n\r\nunilateral   waiver  of  visa  is  not  without  precedence   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  As we all know,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens need to have an American visa to  enter  the\r\n\r\nUnited States, but US citizens do not require a visa to come  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Since  the  Immigration  Department  can  allow  US\r\n\r\ncitizens  to enter Singapore without a visa, I feel they  should\r\n\r\nalso  accord a similar privilege to PRC nationals.    Otherwise,\r\n\r\nthis  may  create a misunderstanding that Singapore is  adopting\r\n\r\ndouble  standards in dealing with the entries of Chinese and  US\r\n\r\ncitizens to Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nfor giving me this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having heard my friend, Mr Tay, I would just add,\r\n\r\nbefore I come to the Bill proper, another concern.  I have known\r\n\r\nof  a  case, a year ago, where the father, a PR, was working  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and his son wanted to visit him, and he was  required\r\n\r\nto  pay  a surety bond of $5,000.  He could not get the visa  in\r\n\r\nIndia.   So the father had to make the application.  Of  course,\r\n\r\nwhen I took up this matter with the Immigration Department, they\r\n\r\ntried  to console him and me by saying that this was because  we\r\n\r\nhave  such a large flow of people coming here.  I can understand\r\n\r\nthe problem, Sir, but we must be selective.  We must look at the\r\n\r\ngenuine  cases,  like  those people  who  have  family  ties  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   A  visit  of two weeks will  do  whoever  is  being\r\n\r\nvisited some good rather than harm.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the Minister, I must\r\n\r\nsay  that  he  has given all the details and he has  given  this\r\n\r\nHouse  the  reason  why  this Bill is  necessary.   One  of  the\r\n\r\nearliest laws that Singapore had was the Immigration law in  one\r\n\r\nform  or another.  Sir, I will not deal with the Bill clause  by\r\n\r\nclause,  as  the Minister has amply dealt with them.   I  am  in\r\n\r\nsupport  of most of the provisions, especially those which  deal\r\n\r\nwith  higher  punishments.  I think it is high time we  enhanced\r\n\r\nthe penalties because, despite an amendment to the law some time\r\n\r\nago,  there is, as the Minister has pointed out, an increase  in\r\n\r\nboth  illegal  immigrants and overstayers.  Members  may  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nincrease  in  punishment  will deter.   Certainly,  the  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants will have to think twice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which I had spoken earlier in this House is\r\n\r\nthis.   Our  missions  abroad have also to  carry  the  task  of\r\n\r\ninforming  the public there that anybody who flouts the  law  in\r\n\r\nSingapore will be severely dealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area which has been of some concern to lawyers\r\n\r\nwould be the question of presumption.  It is not something  new.\r\n\r\nIt  has  been in our law and I think we should have  it  because\r\n\r\nunless we have this presumption, we are going to have difficulty\r\n\r\nin enforcement.  In any case, I would like to assure the Members\r\n\r\nof  this House and the public at large that the presumption  can\r\n\r\nalways  be  rebutted.  It is for the person who  is  charged  to\r\n\r\ndisprove.  It does not make him guilty straightaway.  So I would\r\n\r\nsay  that it is timely and we should have it, especially in this\r\n\r\nlaw,   as   the  Minister  has  graphically  pointed   out   the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  our Coast Guard and Immigration officers  have  to\r\n\r\nface.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than our Malay community, we are basically\r\n\r\nimmigrant people.  We will have immigrants and we encourage them\r\n\r\nto  come here.  We are encouraging talents to come here, as  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has pointed out in his National Day Rally Speech.\r\n\r\nBut  at the same time, we must keep a check and balance whom  we\r\n\r\nwant  to  welcome  in Singapore.  Although it would  be  out  of\r\n\r\npoint,  I would like to request the Minister to consider getting\r\n\r\nfast  speed boats and things like that so that our coastal areas\r\n\r\ncan be amply guarded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area which I am also concerned, and I think\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  has  pointed out, is people who  pose  danger  to\r\n\r\npublic health.  My concern is on a very small but very important\r\n\r\narea.   We do not want the flesh trade in Singapore to increase.\r\n\r\nThis  happens  in most countries where, because of the  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn, some desperate people are driven to this.  It is  very\r\n\r\nimportant  that we must keep a tight check, not just  on  public\r\n\r\nmorality but also on the question of public health.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd  I  am  glad  that  we have now imposed  a  condition  which\r\n\r\nrequires a compulsory check by a qualified medical practitioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one problem that we would have to consider is this. I\r\n\r\nknow  it  is  a serious problem  how to discourage  people  from\r\n\r\ntravelling with false documents?  In my course of work,  I  have\r\n\r\nhad  to  deal  with this problem twice.  I think the  Government\r\n\r\nmust take precaution because some Singaporean racket is involved\r\n\r\nand  unless  we  know  the source, unless we  get  these  people\r\n\r\nbusted, the poor victims will always be exploited.  I know it is\r\n\r\nvery difficult to ask every visitor to be thumb-printed, but  it\r\n\r\nis  important, for our own national security, that  whenever  an\r\n\r\nimmigration officer feels that there is reason to believe that a\r\n\r\nperson is not of bona fide standing, then we should impose  this\r\n\r\ncondition.   Because there is nothing to stop these people  from\r\n\r\ntravelling with a new passport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these observations, I would like to support the\r\n\r\nBill  and  I  would urge the Minister to consider reviewing  the\r\n\r\nwhole  of  the immigration law so that the national security  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is not put to risk.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the\r\n\r\nBill,  especially on the provision to impose penalties for those\r\n\r\ninvolved  in illegal immigration and entry into Singapore.   The\r\n\r\ndeteriorating  economic and political situation  in  the  region\r\n\r\ncould  turn Singapore into one huge haven for refugees if we  do\r\n\r\nnot  have  stringent  and  punitive measures  to  deter  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigration.  This little country can ill afford to  accommodate\r\n\r\nor  hope what could potentially be a bigger problem than we have\r\n\r\never thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, concerned about something quite different\r\n\r\nabout  amendments  to section 8(b) and would like  to  seek  the\r\n\r\nMinister's clarification on the matter for two reasons:  (1)  on\r\n\r\nthe effects of tourism and visitors; and (2) on justice should a\r\n\r\nvisitor  find  himself in breach of a law after he  has  entered\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Section 8(b) terms a person suffering from AIDS as a\r\n\r\nprotected immigrant.  I would like to draw\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\na   difference   between   a  person  visiting   Singapore   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently an AIDS patient finds himself to have breached  the\r\n\r\nlaw as against a person or AIDS patient who enters Singapore and\r\n\r\nengages   in   activities  that  certainly   bring   danger   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that while we should have thorough and stringent\r\n\r\nmedical  examination as a pre-requisite to allowing  someone  to\r\n\r\nwork  in  Singapore  or  stay  here  for  a  long  period,  such\r\n\r\nprecautions are necessary to ensure that AIDS patients will  not\r\n\r\ncause  health and other problems.  However, I seek clarification\r\n\r\non  the  following.   First, does the clause impose  unnecessary\r\n\r\nbarriers and prohibition of travel of AIDS patients amongst  our\r\n\r\nvisitors  and  tourists?  Secondly, are  we  not  discriminating\r\n\r\nagainst AIDS patients by making travel and access in and out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore difficult for them?  I am not making a moral  judgment\r\n\r\nhere  but I think we can guarantee travellers/visitors free  and\r\n\r\nunobstructive access to travel in Singapore so long as  they  do\r\n\r\nnot cause danger to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking up\r\n\r\non this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me answer Mr Zulkifli's point about HIV\r\n\r\ncarriers.   This  amendment  is not intended  to  stop  any  HIV\r\n\r\ncarrier  from  coming here as a tourist.  If he  is  here  as  a\r\n\r\ntourist, a short-term visitor, he is not subjected to this Bill.\r\n\r\nThis  amendment on medical examination of people who may be  HIV\r\n\r\ncarriers  only  applies to those who work in  Singapore  or  who\r\n\r\napply  to  work in Singapore, and those people who  are  staying\r\n\r\nhere for some time.  So if they are here as short-term visitors,\r\n\r\nthey  are  not  affected.  If they are here on long-term  social\r\n\r\nvisit  pass, then they would be affected.  For example, if  they\r\n\r\nare here on a student pass, even though they may not be workers,\r\n\r\nthey would be subjected to this amendment if they are here for a\r\n\r\nlong  period.  Similarly, for those who are here on professional\r\n\r\nvisit  pass,  they  would also be subjected to  this  particular\r\n\r\nrequirement.  So let me assure the Member that this Bill is  not\r\n\r\nto deter any tourist who may be an HIV carrier.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now talk about another point which Mr Rai\r\n\r\nraised before I talk about the general point about visitors.  On\r\n\r\nspeedboats, yes, indeed, we have to have a lot of speedboats and\r\n\r\nthis  is  what  the Police Coast Guard is doing:  upgrading  its\r\n\r\ncapability and resources and renewing its speedboats  when  they\r\n\r\nbecome  due  for  renewal.  And as a result,  we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nacquire a few more very fast boats.  Recently, I sat in one  and\r\n\r\nfound it very good indeed.  I think it would be adequate for the\r\n\r\npurpose  of patrolling our shores to ensure that those who  come\r\n\r\non  very high speed speedboats will easily be caught by  us  and\r\n\r\nthere would be no way of getting away from it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the more general point about tourists, this amendment is\r\n\r\nnot  intended  to  discourage  tourists.   We  want  to  welcome\r\n\r\ntourists  but at the same time we do not want these tourists  to\r\n\r\nbecome overstayers.  And how do we do that?  It is to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat  those whom we think or believe are likely to be  potential\r\n\r\noverstayers,  we  must  make it difficult  for  them  to  become\r\n\r\noverstayers.  Therefore, for some time now, we have  implemented\r\n\r\nvisa requirements for those who come from India and subsequently\r\n\r\nfor  those  who come from China and now for those who come  from\r\n\r\nBangladesh.  We require them to furnish a bond and apply  for  a\r\n\r\nvisa before they can come here as a visitor.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they come here to work, then of course their agents will\r\n\r\nbring them in and apply for work permits and if their permit  is\r\n\r\napproved,  they will come here to work.  But if they  just  come\r\n\r\nhere and claim to be a tourist and eventually overstay, then  we\r\n\r\nmust find ways to sieve them out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our intention to impose stringent conditions on\r\n\r\ntour companies bringing in tourists.  It is not our intention to\r\n\r\ndry  up  their  business by requiring them to  put  up  security\r\n\r\nbonds.   But while we welcome tourists, while we want to promote\r\n\r\nsuch  tour  companies, we must also bear in mind that we  should\r\n\r\nnot  allow  some  of these people who come here to  overstay  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give Members some data to illustrate what I\r\n\r\nmean  when  we  have to impose visa or security bonds.   Let  me\r\n\r\nstart with 1994.  Otherwise, it will go into history and it will\r\n\r\ntake  a  long  time.  In 1994, among the total number  of  9,846\r\n\r\nimmigration  offenders, 2,686 or about 25% of them were  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants.  7,001 or the majority of them were overstayers.  In\r\n\r\n1994, we imposed visa on Indian tourists and subsequently we saw\r\n\r\na  slight  decline in the number.  No visa was imposed on  those\r\n\r\nwho came from China.  But in 1996, we decided to impose visa  on\r\n\r\nthose  who  came from China.  As a result, we saw the number  of\r\n\r\noverstayers  from  China went down and  the  number  of  illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants from China went up.  Before I go into the details  of\r\n\r\nsuch  overstayers and immigration offenders, I  will  just  give\r\n\r\nMembers the other figures which I was referring to earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, we had 11,732 immigration offenders. 6,587 or\r\n\r\njust  slightly about half or 55% of them were overstayers.   But\r\n\r\nthe number of illegal immigrants had gone up to 5,001.  In 1996,\r\n\r\nwe  had 14,260 immigration offenders.  The number of overstayers\r\n\r\nwas  8,553 and the number of illegal immigrants was 5,700.  Then\r\n\r\nwe  decided  to  impose visa, as I said, on PRC  visitors.   The\r\n\r\nnumber  of illegal immigrants subsequently went up to  7,599  in\r\n\r\n1997, out of a total of 13,913 immigration offenders.  That  was\r\n\r\nall  normal  activity.  In other words, police carried  out  the\r\n\r\nnormal  enforcement,  etc.  But since March  this  year,  police\r\n\r\nstepped  up their enforcement together with the Immigration  and\r\n\r\nthey   patrolled  our  coast  more  strictly  and  they   raided\r\n\r\nworksites,  residences, haunts, etc.  The number of  immigration\r\n\r\noffenders  arrested in the first seven months alone was  already\r\n\r\nmore  than  that for the whole of last year, 14,874.  And  among\r\n\r\nthem, a great majority, 9,449 were illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made up most of these people? I will come to the\r\n\r\ndetails  which I am talking about.  On Indians, after we imposed\r\n\r\nthe  visa in 1994, it took a while to take effect and the number\r\n\r\nof  overstayers  increased somewhat, but not  that  large,  from\r\n\r\n1,342 in 1996 to about 1,452 in 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut  the number of illegal immigrants coming from India has shot\r\n\r\nup  from 387 in 1996 to 909 in 1997.  In the first seven  months\r\n\r\nof  1998, the number of illegal immigrants arrested shot  up  to\r\n\r\n1,700.   So  when they cannot come through the normal way,  they\r\n\r\nwill  come  in  by the illegal way, ie, by smuggling  themselves\r\n\r\ninto Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more startling is the number of illegal\r\n\r\nimmigrants  from PRC ever since we imposed the visa requirement.\r\n\r\nIn  1996,  the  number of overstayers, ie,  those  who  came  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  legally and overstayed was 2007, but  the  number  of\r\n\r\nillegal  immigrants  was only 516.  After we  imposed  the  visa\r\n\r\nrequirement, the number of PRC overstayers arrested  dropped  to\r\n\r\n694, but the number of illegal immigrants of PRC origin arrested\r\n\r\nwent  up  to  1,854.   In other words, the  figure  has  changed\r\n\r\nsignificantly.   If  they come in legally, they  will  overstay.\r\n\r\nWhen we imposed a visa requirement, they will smuggle themselves\r\n\r\nin.   So  if  we do not have a visa requirement, there  will  be\r\n\r\noverstayers.  Now we have, of course, to take enforcement action\r\n\r\nto  look  for them and eventually repatriate them when they  are\r\n\r\narrested.   So I am not in favour of making it more liberal  for\r\n\r\ntour  companies to bring in foreigners, whether from PRC,  India\r\n\r\nor  any  other country, who are likely to overstay in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe must continue with these visa rules to make sure that they do\r\n\r\nnot  overstay.   Then we can take other actions  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\nnumber of illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complete the picture, just in the first seven months of\r\n\r\nthis  year,  the number of PRC illegal immigrants  arrested  was\r\n\r\n1,909  which  is already more than that for the  whole  of  last\r\n\r\nyear,  although the number of overstayers has gone down to  768.\r\n\r\nThe  more liberal we are in our visa rule, the more people  will\r\n\r\ncome  in here and overstay.  It makes our problem very difficult\r\n\r\nbecause  for Chinese, Indians or Bangladeshis, it is  very  easy\r\n\r\nfor  them  to  blend in with the environment and for enforcement\r\n\r\naction, it is very difficult to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlook  for  them  until  we ask them to  produce  their  pass  or\r\n\r\nidentity card.  So we must continue with this very strict policy\r\n\r\nof  making  sure  that  only those who  come  here  are  genuine\r\n\r\ntourists, and they must have the money.  If not, they should not\r\n\r\ncome  here as tourists. For those who want to come to work, they\r\n\r\nmust apply for a permit.  We should not impose visa on the basis\r\n\r\nof  whether  the  country is friendly or not  friendly,  and  we\r\n\r\ncannot compare whether an American citizen is more favoured than\r\n\r\na  PRC  citizen.  We treat all nationalities equally, but  if  a\r\n\r\nparticular nationality has a tendency to overstay, then we  must\r\n\r\nlook  at  the  visa rule and apply the rule.  If Americans  come\r\n\r\nhere and overstay, then we will apply the visa rule on them.   I\r\n\r\nsee  very  little evidence of that now.  So we do  not  need  to\r\n\r\nreciprocate the American visa rule on Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration Department recently made some adjustments to\r\n\r\nthe   bond  requirement  of  tour  companies.   For  those  tour\r\n\r\ncompanies  which bring in tourists from PRC and  they  can  look\r\n\r\nafter them and make sure that they go home, we can be a bit more\r\n\r\nflexible, and that is where adjustments have been made to reduce\r\n\r\nthe  bond  required for such tourists.  But if they cannot  look\r\n\r\nafter  their  tourists who run away, then of course  their  bond\r\n\r\nvalue will go up.  That is what we have done.  I hope that these\r\n\r\ncompanies which bring in such tourists will continue to do their\r\n\r\nwork and make sure that their tourists go home so that they  can\r\n\r\nreduce their financial burden.

The  circumstances  for\r\n\r\nexecutives and professionals are rather different from those  of\r\n\r\nthe  less-educated  workers.

His\r\n\r\naccusation is completely baseless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in this House, West Malaysian CPF\r\n\r\nmembers are distinguished from other foreign CPF members because\r\n\r\nof   the  historical  links  between  Peninsular  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  West  Malaysians  in  fact  are  given  preferential\r\n\r\ntreatment over Singapore members.  They can withdraw their  full\r\n\r\nCPF savings from age 50, without having to set aside the minimum\r\n\r\nsum,  provided  that they have not worked in  Singapore  for  at\r\n\r\nleast 2 years prior to the withdrawal request.  Singaporeans can\r\n\r\nonly  do so at the age of 55, after setting aside the prevailing\r\n\r\nminimum  sum.   All  foreigners working in Singapore,  including\r\n\r\nWest  Malaysians, were well aware of these rules  upon  assuming\r\n\r\nemployment in Singapore since 1971. They are therefore bound  by\r\n\r\nthe withdrawal rules that they had accepted when they first came\r\n\r\nto  work in Singapore.  Changes to the CPF withdrawal conditions\r\n\r\nfor West Malaysians are being discussed between PM Goh Chok Tong\r\n\r\nand  PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad in the context of wider co-operation\r\n\r\nbetween  Singapore and Malaysia.
