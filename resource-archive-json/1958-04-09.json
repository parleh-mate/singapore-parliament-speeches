The  Government of  Singapore  will\r\n\r\ntake over the complete internal self-government of\r\n\r\nthis  island. The Federation of Malaya will  share\r\n\r\nresponsibility in the field of internal  security.\r\n\r\nThe  United  Kingdom Government will  continue  to\r\n\r\ndischarge  her responsibilities in  the  field  of\r\n\r\nexternal   relations   and   defence.   The    new\r\n\r\nConstitution  will  give to  the  people  of  this\r\n\r\nisland  the opportunity they have sought  and  the\r\n\r\nright  they  have  demanded to  manage  their  own\r\n\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore exists because of its trade. Under the\r\n\r\nnew  Constitution the Government of the  State  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  acting with the assent of  the  United\r\n\r\nKingdom   Government,  will  have  the  power   to\r\n\r\ninitiate and conduct matters concerning trade  and\r\n\r\ncultural relations with other countries. There  is\r\n\r\nprovision  in  this field to extend the  scope  of\r\n\r\ndelegated  authority.  It  is  unlikely   that   a\r\n\r\nresponsible  Government interested in the  welfare\r\n\r\nof  the  people and the prosperity of this  island\r\n\r\nwill find this agreement restrictive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, since the Second Session of this Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe   Federation  of  Malaya  has  emerged  as   a\r\n\r\nsovereign  independent state.  The  Government  is\r\n\r\nhappy to record the continued cordial relationship\r\n\r\nwhich  it  enjoys  with  the  Government  of   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government takes the stand that union with\r\n\r\nthe Federation is inevitable,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  will  direct its energies towards creating  a\r\n\r\nclimate and conditions conducive to such a union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to recommend to the\r\n\r\nAssembly  the holding of elections for an enlarged\r\n\r\nAssembly under the new Constitution as soon as  it\r\n\r\nis  practically possible to do so.  The  timetable\r\n\r\nwill  depend  on the preparation and enactment  of\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  constitutional  instruments   and\r\n\r\nlegislation  as  well as any measures  which  this\r\n\r\nAssembly  may decide to adopt in order to  improve\r\n\r\nthe  electoral  procedure. The Government  intends\r\n\r\nthat   the  agreement  with  the  United   Kingdom\r\n\r\nGovernment  on  the  form  of  the  constitutional\r\n\r\ninstruments  should  be  made  by  the   All-Party\r\n\r\ndelegation  which took part in the  Constitutional\r\n\r\ndiscussion last year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government proposes to hold elections for\r\n\r\nDistrict  Councils in the middle of this  year  at\r\n\r\nwhich  some  233,000 persons will be  eligible  to\r\n\r\nvote on a residential franchise. Besides the three\r\n\r\nDistrict Councils there will be a Southern Islands\r\n\r\nLocal Council for the Southern Islands composed of\r\n\r\nan  official Chairman, three nominated members and\r\n\r\nnine   ketua  elected  by  ballot.  The  necessary\r\n\r\nlegislation   will  be  introduced   during   this\r\n\r\nSession. These elected Councils will take over the\r\n\r\nfunctions of the Rural Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of holding civics courses for\r\n\r\nrepresentative groups of people from all parts  of\r\n\r\nSingapore has proved very successful and  will  be\r\n\r\ncontinued   in   order   to   promote   a   better\r\n\r\nunderstanding  among  the  citizens  of  what  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is doing for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue with its determined\r\n\r\nefforts  to  combat  crime,  gangster  and  secret\r\n\r\nsociety activities. Legislation will be introduced\r\n\r\nto  increase the penalties for kidnapping  and  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate  the  work of the Police  in  combating\r\n\r\nthis menace. The increased awareness by the public\r\n\r\nfor  the  need to give all possible assistance  to\r\n\r\nthe  police  is encouraging. The Government  hopes\r\n\r\nthat this will be continued in greater measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue its vigilance in\r\n\r\ncountering Communist infiltration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  subversion and will not hesitate  to\r\n\r\ntake  whatever steps are required to counter  this\r\n\r\nthreat  to  the livelihood and well-being  of  the\r\n\r\ncitizens of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will maintain the established high\r\n\r\nstandards  of efficiency and morale of the  Police\r\n\r\nand of the 1st Battalion of the Singapore Regiment\r\n\r\nwhich is now over 400 strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of the Federation of Malaya has\r\n\r\ndecided  that its broadcasting service  should  be\r\n\r\nrun   separately  from  that  of  Singapore.

In\r\n\r\naddition, the Institute of Health - a joint  project\r\n\r\nshared by the Government, the City Council and the\r\n\r\nUniversity - is  due to be opened this  month.  This\r\n\r\nwill  provide training facilities for medical  and\r\n\r\npara-medical personnel besides Maternity and Child\r\n\r\nWelfare  and School Medical Services. The hospital\r\n\r\nfor the chronic sick is nearing completion and the\r\n\r\nGovernment anticipates that its 400 beds  will  be\r\n\r\nready for use early next year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has planned to build ten Outpatient clinics, construction on the first three\r\n\r\nof which will commence this year.
