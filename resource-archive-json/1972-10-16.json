These changes will come\r\n\r\ninto  effect  from  3.00  p.m. today,  i.e.  16th\r\n\r\nOctober, 1972.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised taxes are on non-essential spending.\r\n\r\nTaxes  on  luxuries, in accordance  with  the  tax\r\n\r\nprinciples  contained in the  President's  Address\r\n\r\nand  Addendum, must gradually go up. They  do  not\r\n\r\nand  will not affect essential items, and so  will\r\n\r\nnot add to the cost of living of ordinary workers.\r\n\r\nThey  have been prompted as much by the  need  for\r\n\r\nmore  revenue  as  by the need to achieve  certain\r\n\r\nnecessary   or  desirable  economic   and   social\r\n\r\nobjectives.  A  cut  in  the  use  of   cars   and\r\n\r\nconsumption  of  petroleum  will  reduce   traffic\r\n\r\ncongestion and pollution. A drop in consumption of\r\n\r\nliquors,  tobacco and cigarettes will promote  the\r\n\r\nnation's  health. The lower consumption  of  these\r\n\r\nnearly  all imported goods will also save  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are expected to yield some $38.25\r\n\r\nmillion in additional revenue. This small sum will\r\n\r\nbe  useful, however, to meet part of the  expected\r\n\r\nadditional  Government  expenditure  in  the  near\r\n\r\nfuture.   Part  will  go  into  directly   related\r\n\r\nexpenditure  on roads and flyovers; part  will  go\r\n\r\ninto  the increased disbursements on salaries  and\r\n\r\nthe  13th  annual payment. The Government proposes\r\n\r\nto  pay a further annual payment in December  this\r\n\r\nyear, although only eight months will have elapsed\r\n\r\nsince  the last such payment. In future  the  13th\r\n\r\nannual payment will be made in December, when they\r\n\r\nwill   be   most  welcome,  because  of   seasonal\r\n\r\nrequirements.   In   addition,   the    Government\r\n\r\nanticipates  by  next  June,  in  accordance  with\r\n\r\nNational  Wages  Council guidelines,  to  increase\r\n\r\nwages  and salaries of civil servants. There  will\r\n\r\nalso  be  revisions of salaries of civil  servants\r\n\r\nwho  have stagnated for a very long time on  their\r\n\r\npresent salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison of the previous and new rates is\r\n\r\nshown  in the Table (See Appendix, cols. 85-8.) which I have asked the  Clerk\r\n\r\nto distribute to Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Copies  of the Table handed in to the  Clerk  and\r\n\r\ndistributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional particulars of the taxes are as\r\n\r\nfollows: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Liquors</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The customs duties have not been revised for\r\n\r\nbrandy  and  whisky since 1955  and  for  liqueurs\r\n\r\nsince  1947. They were last revised for  wines  in\r\n\r\n1964 and for beer and stout in 1968. With the rise\r\n\r\nof  per  capita  income, the  consumption  of  all\r\n\r\nliquors  has  increased.  It  is  hoped  that  the\r\n\r\nincreased  duties  may have the  desirable  social\r\n\r\neffect of reducing the consumption of liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Cigarettes and Tobacco</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government's anti-smoking campaign and the\r\n\r\nrevision  of  customs duties in  early  1970  have\r\n\r\nslightly retarded the growth of smoking among  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  The  previous  average  increase   of\r\n\r\nbetween  7 per cent and 10 per cent in the  annual\r\n\r\nconsumption  of cigarettes has been  cut  down  to\r\n\r\nabout  3 per cent during the last two years. These\r\n\r\nfigures  show  that  Government's  policy  against\r\n\r\nsmoking  has had some success. Duties on  imported\r\n\r\ncigarettes  and  leaf tobacco have been  increased\r\n\r\nfurther and may reinforce other measures like  the\r\n\r\nban  on cigarette advertisements. Without increase\r\n\r\nin  duty,  the  rise  in  spending  power  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation  might  lead to increased  consumption,\r\n\r\nespecially by young people taking to the habit for\r\n\r\nthe  first time. The increase in customs  duty  of\r\n\r\ncigarettes  will be beneficial either way:  if  it\r\n\r\ncuts  down  smoking, the health of the  population\r\n\r\nwill  benefit; if it does not, the Government will\r\n\r\nobtain  some compensating revenue which will  help\r\n\r\nto  meet  the  increased burdens  of  health  care\r\n\r\ncaused  by  tobacco-induced  diseases,  especially\r\n\r\nlung  cancer  and chest diseases.  The  Government\r\n\r\nwould  not  be unhappy to see revenue fall.  Young\r\n\r\npeople  should not start smoking. It is  a  dirty,\r\n\r\ndangerous and expensive habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Import  Duty  and Additional Registration  Fee  on Private Cars</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various studies of the pattern of long-term\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the Republic have shown that action\r\n\r\nhas to be taken to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\navoid   the  Republic  being  swamped   by   motor\r\n\r\nvehicles.  Private cars serve a useful purpose  in\r\n\r\ntransporting the people. But they have also  often\r\n\r\nbecome  items of conspicuous consumption.  Despite\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  effort  in  improving  existing\r\n\r\nroads  and constructing new ones, the increase  in\r\n\r\nthe number of vehicles has aggravated the problems\r\n\r\nof  traffic  congestion  and  air  pollution.  The\r\n\r\nnumber of cars has been increasing at the rate  of\r\n\r\n8-10  per  cent per annum. We are unable to  build\r\n\r\nroads  and flyovers at 8-10 per cent to match  the\r\n\r\nrate  of  increase of cars. We shall have to  take\r\n\r\nfurther  action  to discourage greater  and  often\r\n\r\nunnecessary ownership of cars, especially  amongst\r\n\r\nthe  ever  more common two- or three-car families.\r\n\r\nThe  alternative is chaos and congestion.  Traffic\r\n\r\nwill be paralysed, affecting our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to reduce the buying of cars, we are\r\n\r\nadopting a two-pronged policy. First, taxes on the\r\n\r\npurchase  of  all types o new cars will  increase.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Road Tax on medium and bigger cars  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to go up. The import duty has  therefore\r\n\r\nbeen  increased fiom 30 per cent to 45  per  cent.\r\n\r\nThe  Additional  Registration Fee  has  been  made\r\n\r\nuniform  at  the rate of 25 per cent for  imported\r\n\r\nCommonwealth,  non-Commonwealth cars  and  locally\r\n\r\nassembled  cars.  This  harmonisation  means  that\r\n\r\nBritish  imported cars will have to pay  the  same\r\n\r\nrates  as  other cars. As popular  brands  of  the\r\n\r\nsmaller  British  cars like  the  Austin,  Morris,\r\n\r\nVauxhall,   Escort  and  Cortina   are   assembled\r\n\r\nlocally, only British luxury cars like the Jaguar,\r\n\r\nRover  and  Rolls Royce will be affected  by  this\r\n\r\nabolition   of  special  preferential  rates   for\r\n\r\nimported British cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be no change in the import duty and\r\n\r\nadditional  registration  fee  for  omnibuses  and\r\n\r\ngoods vehicles. So public transport which we  want\r\n\r\nto  make  popular will not be burdened with  extra\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Road Tax on Private Cars</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1966, the basis of road tax on motor\r\n\r\nvehicles was changed from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  horse power to the cylinder capacity  of  the\r\n\r\nengine.   The   road   tax  is   being   increased\r\n\r\nprogressively  on  private cars above  1,000  c.c.\r\n\r\nOwners  of  medium  size cars  will  have  to  pay\r\n\r\nbetween  $22 and $40 more per annum. For  example,\r\n\r\nthe  Austin A40 and the Hillman Minx will pay  $24\r\n\r\nand  $30  respectively more per annum. Larger  and\r\n\r\nexpensive   cars  will  have  road  tax  increases\r\n\r\nranging   from  $200  to  $1,200.   The   largest\r\n\r\nincreases  will be for Rolls Royce, Mercedes  600,\r\n\r\nChevrolet Impala, Bentley, and similar cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These revised rates should encourage more people\r\n\r\nto  use  public transport, whether buses or taxis.\r\n\r\nIt  is  in  the interest of all in Singapore  that\r\n\r\nmost  people  should use such public transport  to\r\n\r\ntravel  to  their places of work, particularly  in\r\n\r\nthe  central city area. The Government intends  to\r\n\r\nimprove  public transport by better,  cleaner  and\r\n\r\nmore  regular buses, and with conductors, bus  and\r\n\r\ntaxi drivers being more courteous and considerate.\r\n\r\nFor  the  long-term, there is a feasibility  study\r\n\r\nfor a Mass Rapid Transit System.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Petrol</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to encourage economy in the use of\r\n\r\ncars   the   duty  on  petrol  has  been  slightly\r\n\r\nincreased from $1.30 to $1.35 per gallon, although\r\n\r\nthe  rates given in the table are indicated in the\r\n\r\nmetric  system  as $2.80 to $2.97  per  decalitre.\r\n\r\nAgain,  the  increase in the duty will not  affect\r\n\r\npublic  transport, as all buses and taxis  run  on\r\n\r\ndiesel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non  the  question of revised tax on private  motor\r\n\r\nvehicles, I am just wondering whether it would not\r\n\r\nbe  more logical, instead of increasing the tax on\r\n\r\nall  categories  of  vehicles except  those  under\r\n\r\n1,000 c.c., to impose the increase on those people\r\n\r\nwho own more than one car. Surely the intention is\r\n\r\nto  discourage  people having too many  cars.  For\r\n\r\ncars  up  to  2,000  c.c., I  think  it  is  quite\r\n\r\nreasonable for the rates to remain the same.

It\r\n\r\nis  also a golden opportunity for me to say a  few\r\n\r\nwords in support of the speech of the President.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know very well that our island Republic\r\n\r\nwith more than two million mouths to feed has done\r\n\r\nextremely  well  in the past few  years.  We  have\r\n\r\nsolved  most  of our social and economic  problems\r\n\r\nwhich   only  a  few  years  ago  appeared  almost\r\n\r\nunsolvable to a lot of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople both inside and outside Singapore. In fact,\r\n\r\nwe  have  done  much more than  just  solving  the\r\n\r\nproblems. We have created the spirit to succeed in\r\n\r\novercoming  problems,  the  spirit  to   sacrifice\r\n\r\nindividual  rights  for  the  well-being   o   our\r\n\r\ncountry.  We  may  proudly call this  spirit  \"the\r\n\r\nSpirit of Singapore\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our successes, Singapore is now\r\n\r\nsometimes  classified  as  a  \"developed  nation\",\r\n\r\nthough  we  are still in a developing  stage.  All\r\n\r\nthese  are  the  fruits of the  hard  work  of  an\r\n\r\nhonest, imaginative and intelligent leadership, to\r\n\r\nwhich  I  am  proud to associate myself  now.  But\r\n\r\nproud though we all are, these are not all we have\r\n\r\nin  mind. We want to do more, much more,  for  our\r\n\r\npeople,  for  our beloved country, no  matter  how\r\n\r\nsmall is its size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that all Members in this House\r\n\r\nwill  fully  agree with me that in this electronic\r\n\r\nage  sheer  size means nothing. It is the  quality\r\n\r\nthat  counts it is the quality of the people  that\r\n\r\ndecides  the destiny of a country. If all we  have\r\n\r\nwere  big  pieces of waste land with  millions  of\r\n\r\nilliterate  and  poor  quality  people,  not  even\r\n\r\nsupermen could lead them to prosperity. But we are\r\n\r\nfortunate  to  have  hardworking  and  intelligent\r\n\r\npeople living on this island at the cross-roads of\r\n\r\nthe world. We have inherited the best cultures  of\r\n\r\nboth  the  East and the West, but we have  yet  to\r\n\r\nmelt  them down completely, drain out the  harmful\r\n\r\nand  the useless, and to mould the rest into a new\r\n\r\nprogressive  culture which  we  may  call  it  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  culture.  This  is  a  difficult  task.\r\n\r\nBecause  it  is  not  easy, it is  therefore  more\r\n\r\nchallenging and interesting to excel ourselves  to\r\n\r\ntry and achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we can create a unique Singapore culture\r\n\r\nwhich  would  be  the envy of the world,  we  must\r\n\r\nfirst  of  all  further raise the quality  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  Although we are successful,  economically\r\n\r\nand  socially,  there  is  still  ample  room  for\r\n\r\nimprovement.  We  are  a metropolitan  state  with\r\n\r\nvirtually  no  countryside,  not  to  mention  any\r\n\r\nhinterland.  We  are relying on the  patronage  of\r\n\r\nother\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountries  for  our living. We must  therefore  be\r\n\r\nable  to do better than their own people. We  have\r\n\r\nalready had some success in this respect but there\r\n\r\nis  a  lot more that we should do, or we will soon\r\n\r\nbe  caught  up  by  them.  If  this  happens,  our\r\n\r\nimportance  as the brain services centre  of  this\r\n\r\nregion  will  be lost. In order to  maintain  this\r\n\r\nlead,  we  must not allow ourselves to indulge  in\r\n\r\nthe usual bad social habits of big cities, such as\r\n\r\nbeing   individualistic,   selfish,   extravagant,\r\n\r\nhedonistic, indifferent, impatient and  physically\r\n\r\nweak.  These are some of the destructive  elements\r\n\r\nthat   would  ruin  any  people,  no  matter   how\r\n\r\nsuccessful  they  are  now.  We  should,  wherever\r\n\r\npossible,  encourage our people to lead  a  simple\r\n\r\nbut meaningful life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President said in his speech\r\n\r\nthat \"We can become a centre for excellence in all\r\n\r\nfields  important  to  our economic  and  cultural\r\n\r\nlife\".  To  make our city state worthy of  such  a\r\n\r\ndescription, all our people, both old  and  young,\r\n\r\nwhether  educated  in  Chinese,  Malay,  Tamil  or\r\n\r\nEnglish, are required to work harder, to be better\r\n\r\ndisciplined,  to know better of any skill,  be  it\r\n\r\ntechnical   or   managerial   know-how,   be    it\r\n\r\nprofessional  skill  or  languages.  Touching   on\r\n\r\nlanguages,  we  have four official languages.  Any\r\n\r\none  of them may be used in this House. Though  it\r\n\r\nis  always easier for a person to express  himself\r\n\r\nin  his  mother  tongue, there are many  occasions\r\n\r\nwhen it would be more convenient and economical to\r\n\r\nuse  a  common language to speak to our countrymen\r\n\r\nof other ethnic groups. In this competitive world,\r\n\r\ntime  means money. If all our people know  two  or\r\n\r\nmore languages, one of which is common to all,  no\r\n\r\none  can dispute that a better understanding among\r\n\r\nour   people  can  be  fostered  more  easily  and\r\n\r\nwhatever  business to be discussed can be resolved\r\n\r\nfaster. Our progress would then be faster too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has now become the\r\n\r\nmost important business centre in this part of the\r\n\r\nworld.  English, being the accepted  international\r\n\r\nbusiness\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlanguage,  has  become a necessary  lingual  skill\r\n\r\nwhich  any  Singaporean, who does not wish  to  be\r\n\r\nleft  behind, must know. I call it a lingual skill\r\n\r\nbecause  we  need  it to make a living.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nforeign tongue to all of us, except a few.  It  is\r\n\r\nmore  a tool than a language to us. Though  it  is\r\n\r\nnot   possible  to  learn  a  language  thoroughly\r\n\r\nwithout  learning  its content,  it  is,  however,\r\n\r\npossible  to know the content but not  to  imitate\r\n\r\nand  practise it. To be able to do this,  we  must\r\n\r\nall  be  exposed  sufficiently  long  to  our  own\r\n\r\ntraditions  and cultures when we were  young.  The\r\n\r\nknowledge so acquired would then be the foundation\r\n\r\nof  our  education  which would guide  us  through\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if all our people are to be bi-lingual or even multi-lingual, our school teachers\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  work harder. Those who  are  mono-lingual   should  start  now  to   learn   another\r\n\r\nlanguage. Learning is never too late. The  learned\r\n\r\nteacher, Confucius, once said that among any three\r\n\r\nmen  there  must be one worthy to be his  teacher.\r\n\r\nThough his saying does not specify the teaching of\r\n\r\na language, it is equally applicable to any one of\r\n\r\nour school teachers. I am pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nSingapore Chinese Middle School Teachers' Union is\r\n\r\nvery  interested  and  concerned  in  raising  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of the teaching of English as  a  second\r\n\r\nlanguage  in  Chinese schools. I hope  that  their\r\n\r\nmembers will set an example by learning English if\r\n\r\nthey are still mono-lingual. This will serve as an\r\n\r\neffective encouragement to their students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank you and\r\n\r\nMembers  of  this  House for  the  opportunity  to\r\n\r\naddress you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  this First Session  of  the  Third\r\n\r\nParliament,  as the President has pointed  out  in\r\n\r\nhis  speech,  is convened under a situation  quite\r\n\r\ndifferent  from  that of the previous  Parliament,\r\n\r\nespecially when compared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  the  political situation in 1963. It  goes  to\r\n\r\nshow  all the more the distinctive quality of  our\r\n\r\npeople,   the  perseverance  and  the  unrelenting\r\n\r\nspirit of the Government leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent PAP victory in all the 65\r\n\r\nconstituencies   proved   that    the    political\r\n\r\nconsciousness   of   our  people   has   generally\r\n\r\nincreased and they have given, most appropriately,\r\n\r\ntheir  verdict  on  the  false  pretences  of  the\r\n\r\nopposition  parties. The myth  of  the  opposition\r\n\r\nparties  -that  the  people must  have  opposition\r\n\r\nparties   so   that   their   interests   can   be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded, and that it is only with the presence\r\n\r\nof  opposition parties in Parliament can there  be\r\n\r\ndemocracy -has been exposed. The fact is  that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  the people who wanted opposition parties,\r\n\r\nbut ambitious foreign elements who wanted to plant\r\n\r\ntheir  agents  in  our Parliament by  infiltrating\r\n\r\ninto our political infra-structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional amendments-to prevent\r\n\r\nSingapore  from being swallowed up by others,  and\r\n\r\nthe  investigation into the financial  sources  of\r\n\r\nthe  various  political  parties  to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  will not be bought over by others,  are\r\n\r\nthe  basic  rights of our people.  The  opposition\r\n\r\nparties  are  fearful of these two  Constitutional\r\n\r\namendments.  This is quite natural. As  a  Chinese\r\n\r\nsaying  goes,  \"If  one does not  commit  anything\r\n\r\nagainst  his conscience during the day,  one  need\r\n\r\nnot  be alarmed by the knocks at one's door in the\r\n\r\nnight.\" If the opposition parties have nothing  to\r\n\r\nhide,  then  these  two Constitutional  amendments\r\n\r\nwill provide them with an excellent opportunity to\r\n\r\nexonerate themselves. They should therefore  fully\r\n\r\nsupport these amendments; why are they in  such  a\r\n\r\nscurry instead in opposing them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the first time, however, that,\r\n\r\nforeign  elements have tried to set  foot  on  the\r\n\r\npolitical   activities  in   Singapore,   and   it\r\n\r\ncertainly  will  not  be the last.  These  foreign\r\n\r\nmanipulators  of our opposition parties  will  not\r\n\r\nrest  at this. They have in the past attempted  to\r\n\r\nsway  the thinking of our people through the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia.  When  we  had to take certain  pre-emptive\r\n\r\nmeasures against\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsome newspapers in the interest of our people  and\r\n\r\nour  sovereignty, a handful of individuals in  the\r\n\r\nInternational  Press  Institute  expressed   their\r\n\r\nextreme  dislike  and  dissatisfaction.  This   is\r\n\r\nparticularly the case with one gentleman who  came\r\n\r\nfrom a country which claimed to be \"a full-fledged\r\n\r\nWestern  democratic prototype\". He  expressed  his\r\n\r\nprofound  shock  and disgust, and  promptly  burst\r\n\r\nforth  with nonsensical utterances. But, in  point\r\n\r\nof  fact,  his own country had already a precedent\r\n\r\nin  taking even stricter and more severe  measures\r\n\r\nagainst the press. Recently, this government  even\r\n\r\nproclaimed  martial  law. The  first  volley  was,\r\n\r\nironically,  aimed at the press.  Newspapers  were\r\n\r\nclosed  down, and many journalists were  arrested.\r\n\r\nAccording    to   information,   this   particular\r\n\r\ngentleman  himself  has been imprisoned.  The  so-called  freedom of the press which he  so  proudly\r\n\r\ncherished has proved to be unworkable. He  himself\r\n\r\nhas  dismantled  the  facade  of  democracy,  when\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  speech has fallen  through.  But  the\r\n\r\ncurious  thing  is  that the  International  Press\r\n\r\nInstitute  has not uttered the slightest complaint\r\n\r\nor disgust, yet only not so long ago they launched\r\n\r\nan  all-out attack against Singapore. There  is  a\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  which goes: \"If  one  is  on  the\r\n\r\npayroll,  it  is  his  duty to  obviate  disasters\r\n\r\nbefalling his master.\" If this is not manipulation\r\n\r\nby others, what is'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our country is situated at the\r\n\r\ncentre    of    Southeast    Asia-a    militarily,\r\n\r\neconomically,   politically   and   geographically\r\n\r\nstrategic  location.  Whatever  we  do  will  have\r\n\r\nwidespread effect on the rest of the region.  That\r\n\r\nforeigners  are  interested  in  our  country   is\r\n\r\ntherefore  quite  simple  and  natural.  \"Befriend\r\n\r\ndistant  countries, subjugate nearer  ones\"  is  a\r\n\r\nmost   important  strategy  in  the   relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  countries. This historical saying  should\r\n\r\nprovide  a  lesson  for us. We must  be  vigilant.\r\n\r\nWhilst  we  have no intention to harm  others,  we\r\n\r\nmust   nevertheless  possess  the  capability   to\r\n\r\nprotect ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are more than adequate in dealing with\r\n\r\nthese opposition fragments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut  the  greatest challenge that faces  us  comes\r\n\r\nfrom  the Communist party and its agents. From  my\r\n\r\nlong   years   of  experience,  I  respect   their\r\n\r\norganisational  ability. The relationship  between\r\n\r\nChina  and  the  United States, similarly  between\r\n\r\nChina  and  Japan,  have developed  very  rapidly.\r\n\r\nEspecially  in  the case with Japan,  China  would\r\n\r\nrather  establish diplomatic relations with  Japan\r\n\r\nfirst,   setting   aside  other   minor   problems\r\n\r\ntemporarily.  This is an indicator that  it  is  a\r\n\r\nmatter  of time before China will establish direct\r\n\r\nrelations  with countries in Southeast  Asia.  The\r\n\r\ntable  tennis  teams from Singapore and  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  two  independent countries,  visited\r\n\r\nPeking recently. Undoubtedly this is an unofficial\r\n\r\nrecognition  on  the  part of China.  The  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis,  however, are still shouting  that  they\r\n\r\nare  striving  to  establish a  Malaya  (including\r\n\r\nSingapore). A reality which even China has decided\r\n\r\nto  accept  but  the  Barisan Sosialis  are  still\r\n\r\nreluctant  to acknowledge. Their policy  will  not\r\n\r\nthen be accepted by the people of Singapore. It is\r\n\r\nmerely  a  matter of time, therefore,  before  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis will have to revise their  policy\r\n\r\n-   between  now  and  the  time  China   formally\r\n\r\nrecognises Singapore and Malaysia. Or perhaps they\r\n\r\nmay  even  form  a  new political party,  transfer\r\n\r\ntheir  ground  support, adopt a  new  strategy  of\r\n\r\nfirst  recognising our independence  and  then  to\r\n\r\nexploit chauvinistic sentiments, hoping to capture\r\n\r\npolitical  power. We must guard ourselves  against\r\n\r\nthis  move.  Our  people are of  course  not  that\r\n\r\nnaive,   because  we  know  that  if  we  have   a\r\n\r\ngovernment which sets out to work mainly  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese, then our neighbouring countries will  not\r\n\r\ntolerate us that easily. Remember, what we want is\r\n\r\nto  set our own destiny, and, most important, that\r\n\r\nwe  will  be  able to continue to  survive  as  an\r\n\r\nindependent nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service has been accepted by everyone.\r\n\r\nThis  is  the  most  important aspect  which  will\r\n\r\nensure  that our country will continue to maintain\r\n\r\nits stability and economic growth. It should\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  be  overlooked that the military is the  most\r\n\r\nimportant  criterion in a country's survival.  The\r\n\r\nopposition  parties advocate disarming  ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis  is  a  fatal thing to do. Instead  of  being\r\n\r\ndependent  on  others, we should rather  be  self-reliant. The second World War has taught us a very\r\n\r\ngood  lesson. At that time, if Britain  wanted  to\r\n\r\ndefend  the  Malay Peninsula, it was within  their\r\n\r\nmeans to do so. But if that was to be so, it would\r\n\r\nmean   that   they  had  to  reduce  the   defence\r\n\r\ncapability of their Motherland. What was  the  use\r\n\r\nof  winning the battles in the Malay Peninsula and\r\n\r\nhad  London  been  occupied by  the  Germans?  And\r\n\r\nhence, both Malaya and Singapore were abandoned. I\r\n\r\nhave  read  some history of the war in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThere  was  one  author who,  after  examining  in\r\n\r\ndetail  the  war  documents of  both  Britain  and\r\n\r\nJapan,  discovered that before the  war,  military\r\n\r\ncolleges   in  both  countries  had  carried   out\r\n\r\nintensive  studies  of  the  various  attack   and\r\n\r\ndefence   strategies  in  regard  to   the   Malay\r\n\r\nPeninsula.  What is surprising is that both  sides\r\n\r\nhad come to almost identical conclusions. The only\r\n\r\ndifference  was that Britain merely shelved  their\r\n\r\nbattle  plans  for  record purposes,  while  Japan\r\n\r\nimplemented theirs. The result was another British\r\n\r\nmilitary disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered that some of our own military\r\n\r\nofficers  have  not even read the war  history  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  let  alone the war  history  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  In  the  Addendum to  the  President's\r\n\r\nspeech on the Ministry of Defence, mention is made\r\n\r\nof  raising the efficiency of our armed forces  in\r\n\r\nall  elements. Recently, when another batch of our\r\n\r\nArmed Forces scholars were sent abroad on military\r\n\r\nscholarships, it was announced that a new  subject\r\n\r\nhad been introduced in their course of study, i.e.\r\n\r\nthe  study of the history of wars. This is a  move\r\n\r\nin the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the foundation of nation-building.\r\n\r\nIf  the educational standard of our people is low,\r\n\r\nall  these are mere empty talks. In the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears,  the Ministry of Education has continuously\r\n\r\nreviewed and revised its\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neducation  policies,  putting  more  emphasis   on\r\n\r\nscience  and technological education, in order  to\r\n\r\nlay  a sound foundation for nation-building.  But,\r\n\r\nperhaps  owing  to  the changes taking  place  too\r\n\r\nquickly,  there  has  been, quite  understandably,\r\n\r\nsome     unavoidable    dislocation     in     the\r\n\r\nadministration.  The Member for  Bukit  Batok  has\r\n\r\nsaid before that he is an administrator and not  a\r\n\r\npolitician.  I  believe that after  December  this\r\n\r\nyear  when  he  has  assumed  the  office  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister of State for Education, all these will be\r\n\r\nchanged,  and  there  will  be  no  administrative\r\n\r\nsluggishness in the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my working experience in the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Labour, I have discovered an anomaly.\r\n\r\nThere   are  many  graduates  of  vocational   and\r\n\r\ntechnical   schools  who  have  been  trained   in\r\n\r\nsubjects like metal work, woodwork, welding, etc.,\r\n\r\nbut  have  not been taken in by the factories  and\r\n\r\nnot  even  absorbed as apprentices. Instead,  they\r\n\r\nhave  become  car park attendants or office  boys.\r\n\r\nThese  jobs  are  completely irrelevant  to  their\r\n\r\ntraining. This is a waste of their training and  a\r\n\r\nloss  of  our  trained personnel. The Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour   will  study  methods  in  which  we   can\r\n\r\nstrengthen the training in this respect,  so  that\r\n\r\nyoung  workers, who intend to join the  industrial\r\n\r\nproduction  forces, will get the sort of  training\r\n\r\nof  a  better standard and so achieve  a  greater\r\n\r\nlevel of efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial development in our country has been\r\n\r\nvery  rapid.  The  number of industrial  accidents\r\n\r\nalso  increases in direct proportion to the number\r\n\r\nof  workers. Although the Government has tried its\r\n\r\nbest to promote industrial safety and hygiene, the\r\n\r\nsuccess  of this depends largely on the  full  co-operation between management and labour.  In  some\r\n\r\nof  the  factories I visited, I found that  safety\r\n\r\nprecautions  are  not  up  to  the  standard.  The\r\n\r\nfacilities for personal hygiene are far from being\r\n\r\nacceptable; in fact, some are even makeshift. Some\r\n\r\nfactories  do  not  even have  modern  sanitation.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, they have been allowed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarry on production. From now on, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  will  enforce  stricter  compliance   with\r\n\r\nLabour laws and measures, especially against those\r\n\r\nwho do not take seriously the Labour legislations.\r\n\r\nWe  shall  not allow our workers to work under  an\r\n\r\nadverse  working  environment.  If  need  be,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will  adopt more stringent  measures  in\r\n\r\ndealing  with  those who violate our Labour  laws.\r\n\r\nSome foreign industrialists have come to invest in\r\n\r\nSingapore in the posture of saviours of Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  they  treat  our local workers  in  the  same\r\n\r\nmanner  as  they would treat workers in their  own\r\n\r\ncountries.  This  attitude must  be  rectified  as\r\n\r\nearly  as  possible, for otherwise, we would  find\r\n\r\nourselves  difficult  to maintain  the  industrial\r\n\r\nharmony so vital to our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1959, we have achieved outstanding progress\r\n\r\nin  many fields, such as education, social health,\r\n\r\nand   housing   construction.   Our   neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries,  of course, have their own views  about\r\n\r\nour   achievements.  Our  success   has   somewhat\r\n\r\nconspicuously     reflected      the      relative\r\n\r\nineffectiveness of others. This is not our  fault.\r\n\r\nWe  cannot sit back and do nothing just to  please\r\n\r\nother  people.  Our  efforts  are  aimed  at   the\r\n\r\ninterest  of our people. Campaigns such as  health\r\n\r\nand  family  planning have been  held.  Some  hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  may not be in total agreement with  these\r\n\r\ncampaigns: but all these measures are necessary to\r\n\r\nensure  that Singapore will have a better  future.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, while on the one hand,  we\r\n\r\nhave  provided solutions to our problems, we  have\r\n\r\nnot realised that some of the solutions themselves\r\n\r\nhave  brought  about  new  difficulties  and   new\r\n\r\nproblems.  For  example, in the  field  of  public\r\n\r\nhousing  many countries around us, even  those  of\r\n\r\nthe  more  advanced countries in the  world,  have\r\n\r\nexpressed their admiration for our success in this\r\n\r\nrespect. Of course, we do not simply demolish  the\r\n\r\nold  buildings, resettle residents in new  housing\r\n\r\nestates   and   just   stop   there   with   self-satisfaction.  We are aware of some  inconvenience\r\n\r\ncaused but we have good\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreasons  in  doing so. We have done  all  this  in\r\n\r\norder to re-vitalise the older part of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we have solved the problem of housing,\r\n\r\nthis  solution has nevertheless brought along with\r\n\r\nit  other social problems, some of which have  not\r\n\r\napparently  been  considered. For example,  social\r\n\r\namenities  appear to he lacking  in  some  housing\r\n\r\nestates.  Although  there are  community  centres,\r\n\r\nshops,  clinics and other establishments, we  have\r\n\r\noverlooked some other needs. The younger  people's\r\n\r\nneeds  are  catered for by community centres,  and\r\n\r\nthose  who  are  in  the age  group  for  national\r\n\r\nservice  join  the  Armed  Forces.  But  we   have\r\n\r\nunconsciously overlooked the interests of some  of\r\n\r\nthe  middle-aged  people, who are already  parents\r\n\r\nand  who are the mainstay of our country. Some  of\r\n\r\nthem having no other places to spend their leisure\r\n\r\nhours, find their way to the bars. I had lived  in\r\n\r\na  Housing  Board flat and I have discovered  that\r\n\r\nfor many years, I searched in vain for a neighbour\r\n\r\nfor  a  game  of chess. We have neglected,  so  to\r\n\r\nspeak, the social needs of people in the age group\r\n\r\nof  30-50 years. Whilst we concentrate on moulding\r\n\r\nour  younger population, we should not at the same\r\n\r\ntime  ignore  the  interests of the  head  of  the\r\n\r\nhousehold.  Remember,  he  has  a  vote.  He   can\r\n\r\ninfluence the thinking of his whole family. He  is\r\n\r\nalready  socially established.  Whether  he  be  a\r\n\r\nteacher, taxi driver, ordinary factory worker,  or\r\n\r\nhawker, he has an established status. His thinking\r\n\r\nis  more stable. Unfortunately, and unconsciously,\r\n\r\nwe  have  not  been  able to provide  recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities for this middle-aged group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the open spaces of Housing Board\r\n\r\nestates,  plants and shrubs have been  planted  to\r\n\r\nenhance the environment. These shrubs and trees no\r\n\r\ndoubt add colour to and break the monotony of  the\r\n\r\nopen  spaces, but the children who live  in  these\r\n\r\nestates do not make sufficient use of these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities. In fact, it is argued, would  it  then\r\n\r\nbe  better for them to live in China town, because\r\n\r\nthey  could  then  play in the  shaded  alleys?  A\r\n\r\nfamily  of seven or eight would, in any  case,  be\r\n\r\ntoo  congested in their confined home environment.\r\n\r\nBut  when these families shift to their new  homes\r\n\r\nin  the estates, their new neighbours arc complete\r\n\r\nstrangers.  One  would  find  his  neighbours  are\r\n\r\nHokien, Cantonese, Teochew, or Hainanese who  come\r\n\r\nfrom  the various corners of Singapore. There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  a certain feeling of isolation  and  a\r\n\r\nbarrier among them. So each one of' them adopts  a\r\n\r\nsecluded attitude by keeping to his own family and\r\n\r\ncares   not   for  others.  There  is  no   social\r\n\r\nintermixing  among  the  neighbours.  The  parents\r\n\r\nwould  prefer  their children to  remain  at  home\r\n\r\nduring the day as it is too hot outside, or it  is\r\n\r\ntoo   dark   in   the  night.  [Interruption]   My\r\n\r\ncolleague,  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for   Communications,   may   have   an\r\n\r\nextraordinary experience of exposure to  the  moon\r\n\r\nor  gallivanting  at night. He  may  be  quite  an\r\n\r\nexpert   on  this.  His  experience  may  not   be\r\n\r\nbeneficial to the House. I think he should await a\r\n\r\nmore appropriate occasion for its disclosure!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of all this is that children in\r\n\r\nHousing   Board  flats  have  not   much   of   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  stretch  their  muscles,   quite\r\n\r\ncontrary   to  the  intention  of  the  Board   in\r\n\r\nproviding such recreational amenities. This is  by\r\n\r\nno  means  a criticism against the Government.  In\r\n\r\npointing  out all this, I am merely attempting  to\r\n\r\nshow  an example that sometimes satisfactory plans\r\n\r\nor  solutions to a problem very often  neglect  to\r\n\r\ncater  for the ramifications which may be  brought\r\n\r\nabout by the very solution or plan. Over the years\r\n\r\nour  experience tells us that once  a  problem  is\r\n\r\nsolved, it does not necessarily mean that that  is\r\n\r\nthe end. New problems keep cropping up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we move forward and progress, we must at\r\n\r\nall times maintain our vigil and understanding  of\r\n\r\nour  own position in relation to, the degree  and\r\n\r\nlevel of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our neighbouring countries. As  the\r\n\r\nChinese  saying  goes, \"Know yourself,  know  your\r\n\r\nenemy,  and in a hundred battles you will  have  a\r\n\r\nhundred  victories.\" Some people  only  understand\r\n\r\nthemselves but do not understand others.  So  half\r\n\r\nthe battle is lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is this: Our success can be provocative\r\n\r\nto  others.  This is what I mean by  the  residual\r\n\r\nproblems arising out of the solution to the  major\r\n\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  on  behalf of  the  people  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, I thank the President for delivering\r\n\r\nhis  Address  on  the 12th of this  month.  It  is\r\n\r\ndoubtless  that  the  policies  outlined  in   the\r\n\r\nAddress  signify a new era in the history  of  our\r\n\r\nnation  building.  It has set out  many  important\r\n\r\ntasks for us to perform so that in future we  will\r\n\r\nstrive for a more just, more reasonable and richer\r\n\r\nsociety.  The  President also pointed  to  certain\r\n\r\nunhealthy  trends  existing in Western  countries.\r\n\r\nFor example, a section of the population would  be\r\n\r\nenjoying the fruits of the hard labour of  others.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, their attitude is not to  do  any\r\n\r\nwork  hut  to reap the benefits of the  labour  of\r\n\r\ntheir  fellowmen.  Such  wrong  mentalities   have\r\n\r\nbrought great harm to these countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if there are people in Singapore\r\n\r\nwho  harbour this thinking, we should correct them\r\n\r\nby  criticising their faults. Otherwise they  will\r\n\r\nbe  a  hindrance  to our task of nation  building.\r\n\r\nHowever,  we  are  glad that the majority  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  have the good quality to work  hard.  They\r\n\r\nrealise  that  they  must  work  hard  to  improve\r\n\r\nthemselves. They do not believe in luck.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeen able to solve most of our problems because of\r\n\r\nthese  excellent qualities. We have  overcome  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties in our programme of construction  and\r\n\r\nnation  building, and we have been able  to  steer\r\n\r\nour  nation from rough and troubled waters to calm\r\n\r\nseas. We have progressed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall round and our economy is booming. All this  is\r\n\r\ndue  to  the  hard  work and the spirit  of  self-reliance  of  our  people.  In  order  to  further\r\n\r\nadvance  the work of nation building and  to  reap\r\n\r\nmore  fruits of our labour, we should  set  higher\r\n\r\nideals  and  urge  our youths  to  he  more  self-reliant,   so  that  they  can  make   a   greater\r\n\r\ncontribution to the task of nation building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President also touched on\r\n\r\nthe  possibility of spreading prosperity from  the\r\n\r\nurban   to  the  rural  areas.  As  a  Member   of\r\n\r\nParliament  representing a rural  area,  I  firmly\r\n\r\nsupport  this  wise policy. I feel that  with  the\r\n\r\nadoption  of this policy, the people in the  rural\r\n\r\nareas,  like  the people in the urban areas,  will\r\n\r\nenjoy  the fruits of prosperity engendered by  the\r\n\r\nbuoyant  economy. It cannot be denied  that  since\r\n\r\nthe  PAP came to power, we have spent millions  of\r\n\r\ndollars  in construction work, and on the  various\r\n\r\nprojects  to provide better roads, drains,  street\r\n\r\nlamps, and electricity for the rural people. Their\r\n\r\nliving  conditions  have thus  improved.  However,\r\n\r\nthis  does not mean that all the problems  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas have been solved. As a matter of fact,\r\n\r\nmany  M.P.s,  including myself, who represent  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas,  still  feel  that  there  are  many\r\n\r\nproblems  yet  to  be  solved.  For  example,  the\r\n\r\nproblem of better roads, street lights, and  water\r\n\r\nsupply  still  exists in many areas.  In  view  of\r\n\r\nthis.  I  would like to suggest that for our  next\r\n\r\nBudget,  more  funds should be allocated  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  rural areas, so  that  the  rural\r\n\r\npeople  can  enjoy  a  higher standard  of  living\r\n\r\narising  from  our developing economy.  Since  our\r\n\r\neconomy  is booming, it is not difficult  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to allocate more funds for  the  rural\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to bring up another matter, i.e, the\r\n\r\nprice  of  pigs in the rural areas. We, the  rural\r\n\r\nM.P.s,   have   met  members  of   the   Livestock\r\n\r\nAssociation, and have discussed this problem  with\r\n\r\nthem.  We  then adopted certain measures to  solve\r\n\r\nsome of the problems\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the livestock farmers. At one time, the farmers\r\n\r\nwere  allowed to slaughter their pigs on  Mondays.\r\n\r\nHowever, this practice has now been stopped by the\r\n\r\nPrimary Production Department, thus causing a drop\r\n\r\nin  the  price of pigs. I would like to appeal  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister concerned to look into this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Addendum to the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech on the Ministry of Defence,  it\r\n\r\nwas  mentioned that \"the urgency over our  defence\r\n\r\nbuild-up has lessened as we now have some  defence\r\n\r\ncapability.\" This is indeed gratifying because  it\r\n\r\nshows  that we now have a firm foundation  in  our\r\n\r\ntask of nation building and defence build-up. This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  we can review our policy on  national\r\n\r\nservice. The aim of this review is to economise on\r\n\r\nthe  use  of our manpower. I refer to two aspects.\r\n\r\nThe  first is that we should enforce stricter para\r\n\r\nmilitary training in our secondary schools.  Under\r\n\r\nthis arrangement, the training could be done after\r\n\r\nschool    hours   or   during   school   holidays.\r\n\r\nInstructors should be drawn from the regular armed\r\n\r\nforces. If we can do this, we can then shorten the\r\n\r\ntime  for national service. At the present moment,\r\n\r\nphysical  education teachers also give instruction\r\n\r\nin  military training. It is not possible  to  get\r\n\r\ngood results if we use physical education teachers\r\n\r\nfor this purpose. The second point relates to part-time  national service. We should relax our policy\r\n\r\nin  this regard to exempt those who are physically\r\n\r\nweak  or  those who have to solve their  financial\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  and this will also help  to  reduce\r\n\r\nthe shortage of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to touch on the quality of our\r\n\r\npeople.  We know that we have to raise the quality\r\n\r\nof  our  people. We would like to see our citizens\r\n\r\nachieve  a higher level of education so that  they\r\n\r\nhave  the  ability  to earn a  better  living  for\r\n\r\nthemselves.  This  is a fundamental  problem.  But\r\n\r\nwhat  do  we understand by \"good quality\"  of  our\r\n\r\npeople? We have to study this in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom  my  point  of view, I think  \"good  quality\"\r\n\r\nshould  include the following: diligence, honesty,\r\n\r\nknowledge,   sense   of   responsibility,   social\r\n\r\ndiscipline, a sense of fair play, helpfulness, and\r\n\r\na willingness to help others. In addition, we must\r\n\r\nnot  forget  that we must be well-behaved  and  be\r\n\r\npolite and courteous when dealing with people.  In\r\n\r\nthis  connection, I think the Government is  aware\r\n\r\nthat  some people keep long hair and grow a beard.\r\n\r\nThey  put  on  such fantastic attire  that  it  is\r\n\r\ndifficult to distinguish whether they are  men  or\r\n\r\nwomen.  The Government should, through the process\r\n\r\nof  education and other measures, put  a  stop  to\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the President's Address to Parliament, mention\r\n\r\nis  made  of the necessity of keeping our families\r\n\r\nsmall  so  that the next generation will  be  well\r\n\r\nlooked after. Our apprenticeship schemes will meet\r\n\r\nthe  needs of our industries. There is also a need\r\n\r\nto  promote cultural activities and to build  more\r\n\r\nparks  and recreation grounds, so that our  people\r\n\r\nwill  enjoy a more pleasant and richer  life.  Our\r\n\r\nworkers are encouraged to raise their productivity\r\n\r\nso  that  their wages can go up in stages  and  so\r\n\r\nachieve  a  higher standard of living. Undoubtedly\r\n\r\nall  these  measures are correct and constructive.\r\n\r\nFor  the benefit of our future and for the benefit\r\n\r\nof  the  people,  we must support all  these  wise\r\n\r\npolicies  with all our strength. All in  all,  the\r\n\r\nPresident's  Address ushers in a more constructive\r\n\r\nera.  In the next five years, we are going to have\r\n\r\na  greater  number of satellite towns,  with  more\r\n\r\nmodern  industrial and business centres, a greater\r\n\r\nnumber   of  more  sophisticated  and  progressive\r\n\r\nindustries, a better communications system, and  a\r\n\r\ncleaner and greener environment. All these deserve\r\n\r\nthe  utmost  consideration by our  people  because\r\n\r\nthey  are worthy causes. Irrespective of  race  or\r\n\r\nreligion, we should unite and march forward in our\r\n\r\ncommon aim to build a more prosperous and a better\r\n\r\nSingapore  so  that our people can have  a  better\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I draw the attention of hon.\r\n\r\nMembers to Standing Order 47 (6), which states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No Member shall impute improper motives to any\r\n\r\nother Member.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not referring to you, Mr Teong.
