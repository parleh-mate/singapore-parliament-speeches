Ramaswamy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on\r\n\r\nFriday  I  was saying that the Barisan Sosialis  were\r\n\r\nfirst  asking  for full and complete  merger  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of Penang and Malacca. But now, when they  are\r\n\r\ntold\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  complete merger on that basis will  not  enable\r\n\r\nall  Singapore  citizens to become Federal  citizens,\r\n\r\nthey  do  not mention any more of Penang and  Malacca\r\n\r\nbut  ask  for  automatic conversion of all  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens into Federal citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister has already said that it is\r\n\r\nunreasonable for us to put up such demands.  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to show an example to the Barisan Sosialis  how\r\n\r\nit is unreasonable. Suppose two brothers came from  a\r\n\r\nCommonwealth country to Malaya in 1955.  One  brother\r\n\r\nsettled  in  Singapore. The other brother settled  in\r\n\r\nJohore  Bahru.  In  1957, Singapore citizenship  laws\r\n\r\ncame  into  being. In 1957 the brother in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwho  had  already lived in Singapore for  two  years,\r\n\r\nbecame a Singapore citizen. Now, on the Barisan  type\r\n\r\nof  merger, he would become a Federal citizen on  the\r\n\r\nattainment  of merger. But the brother  who  came  to\r\n\r\nJohore Bahru at the same time as his counterpart came\r\n\r\nto  Singapore, and who had lived the same  number  of\r\n\r\nyears  would not be able to become a Federal citizen.\r\n\r\nBut  the  brother in Singapore would become a Federal\r\n\r\ncitizen. Is this reasonable or unreasonable? Let  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis say it. Is it not  unreasonable  to\r\n\r\ngrant  citizenship to one man and refuse  it  to  the\r\n\r\nother when both have the same qualifications?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it was alleged by the Members for\r\n\r\nQueenstown and Changi that after merger on the  terms\r\n\r\nset  out in the White Paper, Singapore citizens  will\r\n\r\nbecome  second-class  citizens.  In  what  way   will\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens become second-class citizens?  It\r\n\r\nis  no  use one speaker after another repeating  this\r\n\r\nfalsehood  without showing how the Singapore  citizen\r\n\r\nwill become a second-class citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason the Barisan Sosialis have put\r\n\r\nforward  is  that Singapore citizens cannot  vote  or\r\n\r\nstand  for election to the Federal Parliament in  the\r\n\r\nFederation.  Federal  citizens also  cannot  vote  or\r\n\r\nstand  for  election  to  the Federal  Parliament  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Why then is one citizen inferior  to  the\r\n\r\nother?  If they say the Singapore citizen is  second-class,  it can also be said that the Federal  citizen\r\n\r\nis also second-class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the Minister for Culture has dealt with\r\n\r\nthis point, but even after the Minister's speech, the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  keep  on repeating  the  unfounded\r\n\r\nallegation  that Singapore citizens are second-class,\r\n\r\nso  that they hope that if this is repeated again and\r\n\r\nagain  by all their 13 Members and published  in  the\r\n\r\nPress,  people  who  read  it  can  be  misled   into\r\n\r\nbelieving what they say is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said citizenship was a\r\n\r\nfundamental right of the people. Who says it is  not?\r\n\r\nHe  says after the merger proposed in the White Paper\r\n\r\nthis  right will be taken away. How will it be  taken\r\n\r\naway?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also said on 21st\r\n\r\nNovember  (Straits Times, 22nd November), \"It  means,\r\n\r\nin  the first place, that if a Singapore citizen goes\r\n\r\nto  the Federation after the P.A.P. phoney merger, he\r\n\r\nwill  become disenfranchised and will not be  allowed\r\n\r\nto  vote or to stand for election in the Federation.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a deliberate falsehood. Even now, if a Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen goes to the Federation, he will not lose  his\r\n\r\nSingapore citizenship. Is it anywhere stated that  he\r\n\r\nwill lose his Singapore citizenship right, if he goes\r\n\r\nto  the Federation after merger? All these deliberate\r\n\r\nfalsehoods  are  uttered to mislead  the  people  and\r\n\r\nmobilise agitation for merger. It is true that  if  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen goes to the Federation, he will not\r\n\r\nbe  allowed  to  vote or stand for  election  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  but  he  will never lose  his  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship    rights.    He    will    not    become\r\n\r\ndisenfranchised.  If  a Singapore  citizen  wants  to\r\n\r\nbecome a Federal citizen, that is a different matter.\r\n\r\nIn  the  same  way,  if a Federal  citizen  comes  to\r\n\r\nSingapore and wants to become a Singapore citizen, he\r\n\r\nhas to apply for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis' main object is nothing but to\r\n\r\noppose  merger.  That is why they  allege  all  these\r\n\r\nfalsehoods,  so  that  they can  get  the  people  to\r\n\r\nbelieve that the people are losing their rights.  You\r\n\r\nwill  see, Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I am going  to\r\n\r\nstate,  how  insincere, vicious and mischievous  they\r\n\r\nare in their utterances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi on Friday said that by the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposals, Singapore citizens,  if  they\r\n\r\nwant to stand for election, have to have a knowledge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  English  or  Malay, after merger,  or  else  they\r\n\r\ncannot  stand for election. This is true only to  the\r\n\r\nextent  of  Federal  Parliament  elections.  But  the\r\n\r\nMember  went on to say that now, knowledge of Chinese\r\n\r\nis  sufficient,  but after the P.A.P. merger, people\r\n\r\nwho  know  only Chinese cannot stand for election  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federal Parliament. He said so, Sir. It  is  not\r\n\r\nreported in the Straits Times, but it might have been\r\n\r\nreported  in  the  Chinese Press. What  is  the  real\r\n\r\nintention of this allegation? The intention is to say\r\n\r\nthat  the  P.A.P. is taking away the  right  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese-educated to stand for election. Now, let  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis tell us, according to the  complete\r\n\r\nmerger  they are asking for, can a man who  does  not\r\n\r\nknow English or Malay stand for Federal election?  At\r\n\r\nleast, with autonomy in Singapore's domestic affairs,\r\n\r\naccording to the White Paper proposals, there will be\r\n\r\na  multilingual Singapore Legislature.  If  it  is  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger,  there will not be  a  multilingual\r\n\r\nSingapore   Legislature.  They  will  have   only   a\r\n\r\nbilingual  Legislative  Assembly  or  Council  as  in\r\n\r\nPenang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown on 20th November, talked\r\n\r\nabout  what  citizenship  means  and  what  are   the\r\n\r\nbenefits  the citizen will get, besides the right  to\r\n\r\nvote.  It  is  also true that only citizens  can  get\r\n\r\npermanent employment in Government; only citizens can\r\n\r\nbe  given  land for resettlement; only  citizens  can\r\n\r\napply  for Housing and Development Board flats;  only\r\n\r\ncitizens  can  get  legal aid and public  assistance;\r\n\r\nonly  citizens are given passports; and only citizens\r\n\r\ncannot  be banished. He also said that only  children\r\n\r\nof citizens are given preference to others in schools\r\n\r\nand  in  getting scholarships. Thus, he  was  telling\r\n\r\nthis House of the importance of citizenship. Then  he\r\n\r\nwent  on  to say, \"If merger is to have any  meaning,\r\n\r\nthen Singapore citizens must become Federal citizens.\r\n\r\nOnly   then   will   Singapore  citizens   have   the\r\n\r\nopportunity of sharing all these benefits.\"  He  then\r\n\r\nsuggested that if a Singapore citizen does not become\r\n\r\na  Federal citizen, he will lose all his rights.  How\r\n\r\nwill  a Singapore citizen Jose all his rights  if  he\r\n\r\ndoes not become a Federal citizen? He never said how.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Singapore citizens be refused employment in\r\n\r\nthe  Government service? Will they be refused  public\r\n\r\nassistance and legal aid'? Will they not get  Housing\r\n\r\nand  Development flats? He did not quote  one  single\r\n\r\ninstance of how Singapore citizens will lose  any  of\r\n\r\nthese  rights if they do not become Federal  citizens\r\n\r\nafter  merger. He calls the proposals  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper a betrayal, treachery, sell-out, phoney merger,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  Even  the Member for Anson - though  he\r\n\r\nsupports  the  amendment  for various  reasons - admits\r\n\r\nthat the proposals are the best in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe  even complimented, Sir. The only thing he said is\r\n\r\nthat it is not a merger. But the Barisan Sosialis say\r\n\r\nthat all this is a sell-out and they call for general\r\n\r\nelections.  They ask us to resign. I  would  like  to\r\n\r\ntell  the Members of the Barisan Sosialis once  again\r\n\r\nthat they were elected to this Assembly on the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nticket  and that they had pledged to resign  if  they\r\n\r\nwere  ever expelled. Let them honour their word. They\r\n\r\ncannot  just say that they represent the  public  and\r\n\r\nthat the people are with them. If they really want to\r\n\r\nknow whether the public are with them in their demand\r\n\r\nfor  a  complete  merger with  autonomy  in  domestic\r\n\r\naffairs,  such as education, social welfare,  labour,\r\n\r\ntrade, and so on, they should resign their seats  and\r\n\r\nprove their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember the Member for Changi said the other\r\n\r\nday - though  it was not reported in the Straits  Times - that  they  were elected not because  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders  but because of the socialists in the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis who were then in the P.A.P. Except  for  the\r\n\r\nMembers   for  Thomson,  Havelock,  Toa   Payoh   and\r\n\r\nMoulmein,  none  of  the  present  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\nAssemblymen were ever heard of before 1959.  At  that\r\n\r\ntime,  the present important non-Assemblymen  leaders\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis were in prison. I stress that\r\n\r\nthey  were elected on the record of the P.A.P. under\r\n\r\nthe  present  leadership and not on any other  thing.\r\n\r\nThose who do not honour their word stabbed us in  the\r\n\r\nback  at the time of a crucial by-election and helped\r\n\r\nan  opponent to win his election.

What\r\n\r\nis  the  purpose of asking these questions when  they\r\n\r\nknow full well that the people will be better off and\r\n\r\nthey  will have nothing to complain about in a merger\r\n\r\nas  proposed in the White Paper than in a  merger  as\r\n\r\nproposed  by the Barisan Sosialis'? Their purpose  is\r\n\r\nto  create  an impression in the minds of the  people\r\n\r\nthat   they   will  suffer  under  the  White   Paper\r\n\r\nproposals.  When the Minister for Culture was  saying\r\n\r\nthe  same  thing, the Member for Havelock  asked  the\r\n\r\nMinister  to  answer them as though the answers  will\r\n\r\nshow the people that they will suffer. T shall answer\r\n\r\nthe  questions,  Sir. Let them see in  what  way  the\r\n\r\npeople  will  suffer  because  of  the  merger.   The\r\n\r\nquestions  are in the Straits Times of 22nd  November\r\n\r\nin a speech made by the Member for Queenstown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 1 reads: \"What would the civil\r\n\r\nservants  gain  with  merger'? Would  they  get  more\r\n\r\nopportunities for promotion in a wider service  under\r\n\r\nthe  same terms existing or under better terms? Would\r\n\r\npromotion  be  accelerated?\"  If  there  is  complete\r\n\r\nmerger -   as   proposed  by  the  Barisan   Sosialis -recruitment into the civil service will be in the  4:\r\n\r\n1  ratio as in the Federation. But according  to  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper proposals, Singapore citizens will  have\r\n\r\nequal  rights and opportunities for recruitment.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Anson came to their rescue and  tried  to\r\n\r\ntell  us  that this will not affect us as this  ratio\r\n\r\nrelates  only to the Federal service and not  to  the\r\n\r\nState  service. The Deputy Prime Minister has cleared\r\n\r\nthis  point by pointing out the departments that will\r\n\r\nbe left in the State service after merger. Except for\r\n\r\nthe  Land Office, no other big department will be  in\r\n\r\nthe  State service. Therefore, in a complete  merger,\r\n\r\nthe majority of the civil servants will be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 2 and 3 read: \"Would bus companies be\r\n\r\nallowed  to  operate  freely on  new  routes  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation? Would they be treated equally as  others?\r\n\r\nWould  contractors  get  the same  opportunities  for\r\n\r\nbusiness in the Federation as in Singapore?\" The same\r\n\r\nargument as for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service will apply to these  questions\r\n\r\nalso.  Bus companies in Singapore will have  their\r\n\r\npresent  rights  in Singapore in the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nproposals.  But  in a complete  merger,  the  same\r\n\r\npractice  in the Federation will have to apply  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  bus companies also. Which will  benefit\r\n\r\nthem  more - complete merger or merger with autonomy\r\n\r\nin domestic affairs? Contractors who are Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  will  have preference over  the  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  in  getting jobs in  Singapore.  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens will get preference in the Federation. In\r\n\r\na complete merger, certain type of contracts, even\r\n\r\nin Singapore, will have to be given to Malays. Let\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan  Sosialis remember that  there  is  a\r\n\r\npolicy in the Federation by which certain types of\r\n\r\ncontracts  are to he given only to the  indigenous\r\n\r\npeople of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 4 reads: \"Would Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nbe  able to apply for jobs in the Federation after\r\n\r\nmerger?   Would  they  be  discriminated   against\r\n\r\nbecause  they are not Federal citizens?\" Even  now\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens are able to apply for  jobs  in\r\n\r\nboth  territories. Federal citizens are also  able\r\n\r\nto  apply for jobs in both territories. Preference\r\n\r\nmay   be  given  to  Singapore  citizens  in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government and to Federal  citizens  in\r\n\r\nthe Federal Government. After merger, arrangements\r\n\r\nwill  be made to all Federal nationals to be given\r\n\r\npreference in both territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 5 reads: \"Would the products of\r\n\r\nSingapore  schools and universities he allowed  to\r\n\r\napply  for jobs in the Federation?\" Here  at  the\r\n\r\npresent moment, there is no denial of this  right.\r\n\r\nI do not know why the Member for Queenstown thinks\r\n\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 6 and 7 ask whether all Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens would accept the security risk of  moving\r\n\r\nabout  freely  in the Federation. Except  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  will try to undermine the  democratic\r\n\r\nGovernment in the Federation, all people  will  be\r\n\r\nallowed to move about freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 8 reads: \"Would students from\r\n\r\nSingapore  schools  and  universities - particularly\r\n\r\nNanyang  University - have  the  right  to   travel\r\n\r\nfreely in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Federation?\"  If there is to  be  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger without autonomy in domestic affairs, there\r\n\r\nmay   not  be  Nanyang  University  and  no  such\r\n\r\nquestion would then arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions 9, 10, 11 and 12 - all the same reply,\r\n\r\nSir.   When  there  is  autonomy  in  labour  with\r\n\r\ndifferent  labour  laws  in  the  Federation   and\r\n\r\nSingapore, it is only natural that there  will  be\r\n\r\nseparate  bodies of trade unions. But if there  is\r\n\r\nto  be a complete merger, are the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nprepared to accept the same labour laws as in  the\r\n\r\nFederation?  Let them say clearly that  they  will\r\n\r\naccept  the  Federation's  education  policy,  the\r\n\r\nRahman  Talib Report on Education, and so on.  The\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis also know, of course, that  non-Federal  citizens  cannot  hold  office   in   any\r\n\r\nterritory in the Federation. Non-Federal  citizens\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  made leaders as in Singapore  after\r\n\r\nmerger, if it is going to be a complete merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About businessmen, they ask, \"Will they have\r\n\r\nequal  opportunities?\" Even  now  businessmen  are\r\n\r\nenjoying   equal  opportunities.   There   is   no\r\n\r\ninequality   in  the  rights  of  businessmen   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the  Federation.  What  make   the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  think  that  there  will  be  a\r\n\r\ndifference after merger? I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, these questions\r\n\r\nare  put  only to confuse the people and leave  an\r\n\r\nimpression that the people will lose their  rights\r\n\r\nafter merger, thus getting them to oppose merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi has been repeating the\r\n\r\nsame  thing - unequal rights. Where are the  unequal\r\n\r\nrights?  In what way are the citizens of  the  two\r\n\r\nterritories  unequal?  Let  them  point  out   one\r\n\r\ninstance. And without any substantiation, all this\r\n\r\npropaganda will only mean that they are opposed to\r\n\r\nmerger. And they are putting up these unreasonable\r\n\r\ndemands and obstacles only to sabotage merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before ending my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, let\r\n\r\nme  deal with certain points raised by the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson who unfortunately is not in this Chamber\r\n\r\nat the moment. On the question of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nequal   treatment  for  all  the  four   streams   of\r\n\r\neducation,  he  admitted that  there  was  a  radical\r\n\r\ndivergence in the Federation education policy, and if\r\n\r\nthe  people  of Singapore did not wish to  perpetuate\r\n\r\nthis  difference, a Federal Act could easily  provide\r\n\r\nfor   the  maintenance  and  administration  of   the\r\n\r\nexisting  education  policy in Singapore.  What  does\r\n\r\nthis  mean?  This  means that he  wants  a  different\r\n\r\neducation  policy for Singapore. Instead of  mingling\r\n\r\nwords   and  misleading  the  people,  can   he   not\r\n\r\nacknowledge  that this is what the  P.A.P. wants  by\r\n\r\nretaining  autonomy  in education?  He  said  that  a\r\n\r\nFederal  Act  could easily be passed. Of  course,  he\r\n\r\nknows - he is a renowned lawyer - as well as we do,  that\r\n\r\nto  do this, there should be a majority of Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  to agree to any enactment of any  Act  or\r\n\r\nlaw. Suppose after merger we do not get a majority to\r\n\r\nagree  to  pass  this Act. What will happen?  Is  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson prepared to forget  about  it?  He\r\n\r\npersonally may. Will the people of Singapore agree to\r\n\r\nthis?  That  is why we ask for autonomy in  education\r\n\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for labour also, the Member for Anson said,\r\n\r\n\"Even  if  Singapore had full labour legislation  and\r\n\r\npolicies,  there was nothing to prevent  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment authorising the State Government  here  to\r\n\r\nexercise  responsibility in this  field.\"  What  does\r\n\r\nthis  also  mean?  Does  this not  mean  autonomy  in\r\n\r\nlabour?  He says, \"Let us have complete merger\",  and\r\n\r\nthen says, \"Let the State Government be authorised to\r\n\r\nexercise  responsibility in this field.\" Why  has  he\r\n\r\ngot  to  mislead  the people in this way  instead  of\r\n\r\naccepting autonomy on labour, education, and  so  on?\r\n\r\nHe  might as well say, \"Let us have complete  merger,\r\n\r\nand   then   pass  Acts  in  the  Federal  Parliament\r\n\r\nproviding   the  Singapore  Government  to   exercise\r\n\r\nresponsibility  in internal security  as  well.\"  Why\r\n\r\nstop at that? Pass Acts in the Federal Parliament  to\r\n\r\ntransfer full responsibility for defence and external\r\n\r\naffairs of the whole of the Federation of Malaya  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  to the Singapore Legislature so  that  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  can change the foreign  policy  of\r\n\r\nMalaya to suit them. Then the Member for Anson and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis  friends  in the Barisan Sosialis will  be  very,\r\n\r\nvery happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the Member for Anson wanted to know for a\r\n\r\nfact  the  number  of  Communists  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nwhether  there are really so many Communists in  this\r\n\r\nState. I would like to remind him of his days in  the\r\n\r\nyear  1956  when he was Chief Minister of  Singapore,\r\n\r\nand  when  there  were the Hock  Lee  riots,  and  he\r\n\r\nintroduced   the  Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance  to  replace the Emergency Regulations.  If\r\n\r\nthere  were no Communists in this State, why  did  he\r\n\r\nintroduce   the   Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance? Has he forgotten the Hock Lee riots? Who\r\n\r\ninstigated those riots? Who were behind them? Are the\r\n\r\nvery  same people not living amongst us, or have they\r\n\r\ndisappeared? This is one instance, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another instance. After the Tanjong Pagar and\r\n\r\nCairnhill  by-elections in 1957, the  present  Member\r\n\r\nfor Anson said that he had retired from politics. And\r\n\r\nat the end of 1957 the Workers' Party was formed with\r\n\r\nMr  Chang Yuen Thong as Vice-Chairman. The  Workers'\r\n\r\nParty  won  three  out  of four  seats  in  the  City\r\n\r\ncouncil, and with an overwhelming majority. Then,  as\r\n\r\nwe  were  told by the Prime Minister in  one  of  his\r\n\r\ntalks over Radio Singapore, Chang Yuen Thong resigned\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Workers' Party and the City Council.  When\r\n\r\nChang Yuen Thong resigned, there was a by-election in\r\n\r\nKallang.  The Workers' Party candidate who contested.\r\n\r\nthe Kallang by-election got only 300 odd votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

In my speech, therefore, as\r\n\r\nfar as I can, I am avoiding reference to the legal\r\n\r\ntechnicalities of the Federation Constitution, or\r\n\r\nmaking quotations from it. I will also try to refrain\r\n\r\nfrom delving into the details of the White Paper at\r\n\r\nthis stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there has been so much confusion on this\r\n\r\nsubject  of merger, I think it is important  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  discuss the issue dispassionately and without\r\n\r\npersonal   rancour   or  bitterness.   Electioneering\r\n\r\ntechniques or mass meeting techniques will  not  help\r\n\r\nus  to clarify the issue. There have been doubts  and\r\n\r\nconfusion on this issue. Sir, the confusion has  been\r\n\r\npartly due to the introduction of personalities  into\r\n\r\nthis  subject and the petty squabbles during the past\r\n\r\nfew months. All along we have remained silent because\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  want  to  be  involved  in  these  petty\r\n\r\nsquabbles. The doubts have been due mainly to the way\r\n\r\nthe  Government brought forward its so-called  merger\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, that the Government\r\n\r\nrejected  merger talks with the Federation when  they\r\n\r\nwere  requested to do so in one of the  16  Hong  Lim\r\n\r\nResolutions. As far as I can see, it was  only  after\r\n\r\nthe   Hong   Lim  by-election  that  the   Government\r\n\r\ncommenced constitutional talks with the Federation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are broadly three types of views on\r\n\r\nmerger.  Firstly,  there are those  who  support  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  complete merger. Secondly,  there  are\r\n\r\nthose  who  accept  the proposal  of  the  Government\r\n\r\nfor - for want of a better name - I will call a tiga suku\r\n\r\nmerger.  In the third group are those who are opposed\r\n\r\nto  any  form of association with the Federation.  We\r\n\r\ncan now ignore this third\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngroup,  because, for obvious reasons, nobody in  this\r\n\r\nthird  group dares to come out openly to say that  he\r\n\r\nis opposed to merger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been many interpretations of what\r\n\r\nis  complete merger. What is complete merger?  If  we\r\n\r\nhave  complete merger, if Singapore accepts  complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  we  would he like the State of  Johore.  All\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens could become Federal citizens.  We\r\n\r\ncould  vote about 21 candidates, as the Minister  for\r\n\r\nHealth  and Law has calculated - and this we  will  not\r\n\r\nargue  or  dispute  at  the  moment - to  the  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament. This figure of 21 can be worked out later\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is  correct or not.  Now,  if  there  is\r\n\r\ncomplete merger, we would have, at the same  time,  a\r\n\r\nSingapore  State Government, like the present  Johore\r\n\r\nState  Government,  with  a  Chief  Minister  and  an\r\n\r\nExecutive Council. What are the powers of the present\r\n\r\nState  Government  in Johore? They have  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nover the following subjects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Muslim law;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Land matters;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Agriculture and forestry;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Local Government;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Other services of a local character like fire-brigade, burial grounds and markets;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) State public works and water supply;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Machinery of the State Government and a few other minor and unimportant subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  other words, if we have complete merger, the\r\n\r\nSingapore    State   Government    would    have\r\n\r\njurisdiction   in   land   matters   and   local\r\n\r\ngovernment. The other subject matters are of not\r\n\r\nmuch importance.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johore State Government has also\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction over matters\r\n\r\nlike social welfare, parks, hawkers,\r\n\r\npublic health, drainage and a few other\r\n\r\nminor subjects. By concurrent jurisdiction, we\r\n\r\nmean that the State Government\r\n\r\nhas jurisdiction, at the pleasure, more\r\n\r\nor less, of the Federation Government.\r\n\r\nIn short, under complete merger, all\r\n\r\nSingapore citizens would become Federal\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ncitizens,  electing about 21 representatives  to\r\n\r\nthe Federal Parliament, and also representatives\r\n\r\nto  a  Singapore State Assembly, which will form\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  State  Government.  The  Federal\r\n\r\nParliament  would  have  much  power   and   the\r\n\r\nSingapore State Assembly would have very  little\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been arguments on all sides\r\n\r\nabout  what  is complete merger. I  say  to  all\r\n\r\nMembers  who do not understand what is  complete\r\n\r\nmerger,  that the best thing is either to  cross\r\n\r\nthe  Causeway and stay in Johore Bahru for a few\r\n\r\ndays, or ask Federal citizens what it is like to\r\n\r\nlive  as a Federal citizen in Johore Bahru - what\r\n\r\nare his rights, duties, and obligations, and how\r\n\r\ndoes the Johore State Government work?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the P.A.P. proposed merger.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what we say a tiga suku merger.  These\r\n\r\nare  constitutional proposals put forward by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government in White Paper No. Cmd.  33\r\n\r\nof  1961. Under this scheme, there would be  two\r\n\r\ndistinct    types   of   citizenship,    Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship  and Singapore citizenship.  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens who come and live in Singapore  do  not\r\n\r\nenjoy  the  rights and privileges nor share  the\r\n\r\nobligations  of  Singapore citizens.  Similarly,\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  who  go  and  live  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  would  not  enjoy  the  rights   and\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  Federal citizens nor  share  the\r\n\r\nobligations of Federal citizens. The  two  types\r\n\r\nof citizenship are quite distinct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal citizens voting in the Federation in\r\n\r\ntheir  capacity as Federal nationals,  that  is,\r\n\r\naccording to the State Advocate-General's latest\r\n\r\nexplanation,     could    send     about     100\r\n\r\nrepresentatives    to   the   Central    Federal\r\n\r\nParliament.   Singapore   citizens   voting   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   in   their  capacity   as   Federal\r\n\r\nnationals, could send 15 representatives to this\r\n\r\nsame  Central  Federal Parliament. The  majority\r\n\r\nParty  in this Central Federal Parliament  could\r\n\r\nform the Central Government. If Federal citizens\r\n\r\ncome and live and work in Singapore, they cannot\r\n\r\nstand  as candidates; neither can they vote  for\r\n\r\ncandidates to this Federal Parliament.  Nor  can\r\n\r\nthey  exercise the right to vote for  candidates\r\n\r\nin the Singapore State\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nAssembly.  In other words, Federal citizens  who\r\n\r\ncome  and live in Singapore would have no  right\r\n\r\nto  vote in Singapore. If Singapore citizens  go\r\n\r\nand live in the Federation, they cannot vote for\r\n\r\nany candidate nor stand for Federal election. In\r\n\r\nother  words, Singapore citizens have  only  the\r\n\r\nright  to vote in Singapore and Federal citizens\r\n\r\nhave only the right to vote in the Federation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the P.A.P. proposals, Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwould  not  become Federal citizens.  They  can\r\n\r\nonly  vote  in  Singapore for 15 seats  in  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament.  The Singapore  Government\r\n\r\nwould  still be elected by Singapore  citizens.\r\n\r\nThis Singapore Government, as envisaged in  the\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper, would have more powers  than  the\r\n\r\nJohore  State Government, which comes  under  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger.  The additional  jurisdiction\r\n\r\nwhich  would be given to Singapore in the State\r\n\r\nList,   that  is,  exclusively  for   Singapore\r\n\r\njurisdiction, are labour and welfare, education\r\n\r\nand   health.  And  the  additional  concurrent\r\n\r\njurisdiction  would be - I will only  relate  the\r\n\r\nmore important ones, Mr Speaker, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Banking and loans and borrowing by the\r\n\r\nState;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Imports and exports, production of goods and\r\n\r\ninsurance;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Industry and regulation of industrial\r\n\r\nundertakings;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Shipping;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Newspapers, publications, publishers,\r\n\r\nprinting and printing presses;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Administration and day-today programmes of\r\n\r\nRadio  Singapore and television; the policy  on\r\n\r\nbroadcasting and television would be controlled\r\n\r\nby the Federal Government;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) Censorship, theatres and cinemas;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) A few other minor unimportant subjects.\r\n\r\n                            \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a tiga suku merger, the Singapore\r\n\r\nState  Government  would thus  have  some  more\r\n\r\npowers compared to the Johore State Government.\r\n\r\nI am bringing Johore as a comparison because it\r\n\r\nis  nearest  to  Singapore. The  P.A.P.  Government's  contention  is that,  under  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, the Singapore State Government\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nwould  have  more  powers than any  other  State\r\n\r\nGovernments in the Federation, like Johore. This\r\n\r\nI  do  not think we can deny. Therefore, as  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.   Government   contends,   in   exchange,\r\n\r\nSingapore should accept 15 seats instead  of  21\r\n\r\nseats in the Federal Parliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government further does not agree\r\n\r\nthat all Singapore citizens can be qualified  to\r\n\r\nbecome   Federal  citizens  under  the   present\r\n\r\nFederation   citizenship  laws  and,  therefore,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be two types of citizenship,  one\r\n\r\nvoting  in  Singapore  and  one  voting  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  and  both voting  for  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament in their respective territories.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not regard the P.A.P. Government's\r\n\r\nformula  as a genuine merger. It is like joining\r\n\r\na  club  as an associate member. This  club  has\r\n\r\nordinary members like Johore, and it would  like\r\n\r\nto  recruit associate members, as what is  being\r\n\r\nproposed in the White Paper, like Singapore.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  my Party prefers that Singapore  should\r\n\r\njoin  as  an  ordinary  member  and  not  as  an\r\n\r\nassociate member.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government has repeatedly said\r\n\r\nthat  it  does not want Singapore  to  join  the\r\n\r\nFederation as an ordinary member. It is prepared\r\n\r\nto  admit  the  Borneo territories  as  ordinary\r\n\r\nmembers. But it would admit Singapore only as  a\r\n\r\npartner, which I will call an associate  member.\r\n\r\nThere  would  thus be a distinction between  the\r\n\r\nadmission of Singapore and the admission of  the\r\n\r\nthree Borneo States. According to the plan which\r\n\r\nhas  been  announced, sovereignty over Singapore\r\n\r\nwould  be  transferred from the British  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation. In other words, instead of,  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  British being the sovereign  power\r\n\r\nover Singapore, sovereignty would be transferred\r\n\r\nto  the  Federation Parliament. Under the  White\r\n\r\nPaper, citizens of Singapore and citizens of the\r\n\r\nFederation would be called Federation nationals.\r\n\r\nI think it will be confusing if we start arguing\r\n\r\nover  the  meanings of \"national\"  and  \"citizenship\".  It  is best to dispense with and  forget\r\n\r\nabout  the words \"Federal nationals\".  The  word\r\n\r\n\"citizenship\"   and  the  word  \"national\"   are\r\n\r\ninterchangeable, and the important thing to find\r\n\r\nin   each  of  these  phrases  is  what  rights,\r\n\r\nprivileges  and, obligations are  attached?  To\r\n\r\nshow how\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nconfusing  it would be Sir, a citizen of  Johore\r\n\r\nis  called  a  Johore national. He is  a  Johore\r\n\r\nnational;  he  is a Federal citizen;  under  the\r\n\r\nproposed  set-up he would be a Federal  national\r\n\r\nand  he  is also a Commonwealth citizen.  Johore\r\n\r\nnational, Federal citizen, Commonwealth citizen,\r\n\r\nFederal national. He would have four status. But\r\n\r\nthe  other three status do not mean much  except\r\n\r\nthe  status  of  being  a Federal  citizen.  The\r\n\r\nrights, privileges and duties, as I have stated,\r\n\r\nof  a  Johore national derive from the fact that\r\n\r\nhe  is a Federal citizen and not so much because\r\n\r\nhe  is a Johore national, a Federal National, or\r\n\r\na Commonwealth citizen.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore citizens are concerned,\r\n\r\nthe  only  benefit, as I can see  from  being  a\r\n\r\nFederal  national, is that instead of a  British\r\n\r\npassport,  one  gets a Federation  passport.  In\r\n\r\nother  words,  there would be no actual  benefit\r\n\r\nfrom  this  new  concept of a Federal  national.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it  is best for argument's  sake  to\r\n\r\nleave out this concept of Federal national.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have the pros and cons of a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  vis-a-vis  a  tiga-suku  merger.  In   a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger,  we would be like  the  present\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens living, say,  in  Johore.  The\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  in  a  complete  merger,\r\n\r\nwould   be   like  the  present   Johore   State\r\n\r\nGovernment  with very limited powers.  We  would\r\n\r\nvote  21  representatives into the  Federal  Parliament. If we move and live in any State of the\r\n\r\nFederation, we would also have the right to vote\r\n\r\nand   to  stand  for  election  to  the  Federal, Parliament or for any State Parliament.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This movement of citizens to the other\r\n\r\nterritory  is  only  put  up  for  the  sake  of\r\n\r\nexplanation, because we would not expect a great\r\n\r\nwave of emigration of people from Singapore into\r\n\r\nthe Federation or from the Federation into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the \"tiga-suku\" merger. What\r\n\r\nare the pros and cons in the \"tiga-suku\" merger?\r\n\r\nIn  the \"tiga-suku\" merger, the Singapore  State\r\n\r\nGovernment would have slightly more powers  than\r\n\r\nthe present Johore State Government. I have just\r\n\r\nenumerated    those   powers   and    additional\r\n\r\njurisdiction. But there will be two\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\ndistinct  types of citizenship. Federal citizens\r\n\r\ncan  only  vote in the Federation and  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  can  only vote in Singapore.  Both  of\r\n\r\nthem  vote  for representatives to a common  and\r\n\r\ncentral   Federal   Parliament.   Only   Federal\r\n\r\ncitizens  can  enjoy  the  benefits  of  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship  in the territory of the Federation.\r\n\r\nif  they  come  to  Singapore, they  lose  their\r\n\r\nrights.  Only Singapore citizens can  enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefits  of Singapore citizenship in Singapore.\r\n\r\nIf  they  go to the Federation, they  will  also\r\n\r\nsimilarly lose their rights. Singapore citizens,\r\n\r\nvoting  in  Singapore in the \"tiga-suku\"  merger\r\n\r\nwill  send  15  representatives to  the  Central\r\n\r\nParliament.  These are the pros and  cons  of  a\r\n\r\ngenuine merger and the \"tiga-suku\" merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party, the United People's Party,\r\n\r\nstands  for complete and genuine merger  because\r\n\r\nthe  long-term  advantages of a complete  merger\r\n\r\nfar  outweigh any additional autonomy or  short-term  advantages granted to the Singapore  State\r\n\r\nGovernment  under a \"tiga-suku\"  merger.  May  I\r\n\r\nrepeat,  Sir,  the  long-term  advantages  of  a\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger  far  outweigh  any  additional\r\n\r\nautonomy or short-term advantages granted to the\r\n\r\nSingapore State Government under a \"tiga\r\n\r\nsuku\" merger?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This additional autonomy of the State\r\n\r\nGovernment  is more academic than real.  I  will\r\n\r\nexplain  the reasons later. Thus, the  paramount\r\n\r\nissue  on  the  question of merger  is  that  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship. We want a genuine merger because we\r\n\r\nwant  to  see a united Malaya. We want a genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  because  it is only in a  united  Malaya\r\n\r\nthat  we  can  create the basic  conditions  for\r\n\r\nprogress  and  prosperity and  to  effect  basic\r\n\r\nsocial and political changes for the benefit  of\r\n\r\nall the races living in Malaya. In the years  of\r\n\r\ncolonial  history, the British had  adopted  the\r\n\r\npolicy of divide and rule. We have condemned the\r\n\r\npolicy but the constitutional set-up proposed in\r\n\r\nthe  White Paper could not defeat such a policy.\r\n\r\nOn  the contrary, it will consolidate the policy\r\n\r\nof  divide and rule because, instead of a common\r\n\r\ncitizenship for all the peoples of Malaya, there\r\n\r\nwill be two types of citizenship.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such a constitutional arrangement as\r\n\r\nenvisaged  in the White Paper would  not  create\r\n\r\nthe  conditions for promoting undivided  loyalty\r\n\r\nto the Malayan nation. No nation can be built on\r\n\r\ntwo  types  of  citizenship.  Instead,  it  will\r\n\r\ncreate much frustration and unhappiness.  It  is\r\n\r\nonly in a common citizenship that the people  of\r\n\r\na  country  can  share a common  aspiration  and\r\n\r\nfoster  a common Malayan patriotism. The absence\r\n\r\nof   a   common  citizenship  in  the   proposed\r\n\r\nconstitutional set-up frustrates  our  hopes  of\r\n\r\nbuilding a united Malaya. And if these hopes are\r\n\r\nfrustrated, then events may force the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  seek  their own  salvation  until\r\n\r\ngenuine  reunification  is  achieved.   It   is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  my  Party's  contention   that   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  should  negotiate  for  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger  with provisions  for  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens to become Federal citizens.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall take the case of Johore as an\r\n\r\nexample.  All  Johore  State  nationals   became\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens by operation of law on Merdeka\r\n\r\nDay.  Likewise, Singapore citizens should become\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens. We will then enjoy  the  same\r\n\r\nrights  and  shoulder  the same  obligations  as\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens  living  in  other  parts   of\r\n\r\nMalaya.  A  common  citizenship  is  thereby   a\r\n\r\nnecessary condition, if it is our earnest desire\r\n\r\nto  build  up  a  common bond and  an  undivided\r\n\r\nloyalty  towards Malaya. Sir, it is not  correct\r\n\r\nto  say  that  if there is complete merger  only\r\n\r\n284,000  out  of the 624,000 Singapore  citizens\r\n\r\ncould be qualified to become Federal citizens -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Automatic.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Pardon?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> - for the reason that only\r\n\r\n284,000 were born in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the place of birth is a yardstick,\r\n\r\nthen  those Singapore citizens who were born  on\r\n\r\nFederation  soil itself, like the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  who has just interjected, and  most  of\r\n\r\nwhom are entitled to become Federal citizens  or\r\n\r\nhad  obtained Federal citizenship papers, should\r\n\r\nhave  no  trouble  in being given  back  Federal\r\n\r\ncitizenship. Then there are the rest of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nSingapore citizens, who were not born either  in\r\n\r\nSingapore or in the Federation and who had  come\r\n\r\nmainly from China and India. I say that if these\r\n\r\npeople  from China and India had been  domiciled\r\n\r\nin  the  Federation  of  Malaya  instead  of  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,   they  would  today  be   possessing\r\n\r\nFederal   citizenship   instead   of   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The  requisite  number  of  year's\r\n\r\nresidence  is  almost the same, and  there  have\r\n\r\nbeen   no   extra   practical  difficulties   in\r\n\r\nobtaining   a   Federal  citizenship   than   in\r\n\r\nobtaining  a  Singapore citizenship.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nall  categories of citizens in Singapore  should\r\n\r\nbecome  Federal citizens, i.e.,  those  born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  those  born in the  Federation,  and\r\n\r\nthose born outside Singapore and the Federation.\r\n\r\nI  cannot  see  any valid grounds why  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  should not become Federal citizens  in\r\n\r\nthe  same  manner as the Johore State nationals,\r\n\r\nwho   are   the  equivalent  of  our   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to repeat here the articles\r\n\r\nin the Federal Constitution which bestow certain\r\n\r\nrights  on  only Federal citizens,  nor  will  I\r\n\r\nenumerate other rights reserved for citizens not\r\n\r\nstipulated  in  the  written  Constitution.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it can always be argued, on  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,   that   Federal  citizens  cannot   enjoy\r\n\r\nprivileges  and rights of Singapore citizens  if\r\n\r\nthey  come  and  live  in  Singapore.  And   the\r\n\r\nargument   holds  good.  But  the   rights   and\r\n\r\nprivileges  of  citizenship  are  not  the  main\r\n\r\ncriterion,  in  my  contention,  for  a   common\r\n\r\ncitizenship   for   both   Singapore   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation. Of course, these rights are no doubt\r\n\r\nof  the utmost importance. My main contention is\r\n\r\nthat  it is only in a common citizenship that  a\r\n\r\nMalayan  nation can be built and can be  united.\r\n\r\nNationalism cannot be built on weak foundations.\r\n\r\nNationalism  cannot be built  on  two  types  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  The concept of a Federal  national\r\n\r\nwould not bind the people of the two territories\r\n\r\ntogether, just\r\n\r\nas the concept of a Commonwealth citizen does\r\n\r\nnot bind the people of, say, Malaya and, for\r\n\r\ninstance, Australia together. How can we achieve\r\n\r\nour cherished desire? Where is the basis to\r\n\r\nbuild\r\n\r\na single united Malayan nation on a\r\n\r\nfoundation that is divided? I say it\r\n\r\nis only in a common citizenship,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhere    all   share   equal   rights,   common\r\n\r\nobligations  and  destiny,  and  sink  or  swim\r\n\r\ntogether, that we can build the massive base of\r\n\r\na  single,  united, political  identity  which\r\n\r\nshould  be the subject of our devotion  and  of\r\n\r\nour undivided loyalty. Sir, my view is that the\r\n\r\nconstitutional  set-up proposed  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  is  as far as the Federation  Government\r\n\r\nwould  concede  to  the  Singapore  Government.\r\n\r\nAfter  the Hong Lim by-election, the Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment has apparently been convinced by the\r\n\r\nSingapore Government that it is in\r\n\r\nthe  former's  interest to  do  something  about\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  the Federation Government  does\r\n\r\nnot  want  a  genuine merger. I  ask,  does  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government want a genuine merger?  If\r\n\r\nit  does, the Singapore Government must  consult\r\n\r\nOpposition  Parties  at a roundtable  conference\r\n\r\nand  tell  us its difficulties. We  can  plan  a\r\n\r\ncommon  programme to negotiate  for  a  complete\r\n\r\nmerger. But the Singapore Government has refused\r\n\r\nto   do  so.  It  has  bypassed  all  Opposition\r\n\r\nParties. It has agreed with the Federation on  a\r\n\r\nconstitutional set-up which is not  merger,  but\r\n\r\nwhich   they  present  to  us  as  merger.   The\r\n\r\nSingapore Government, in my view, should ask and\r\n\r\nnegotiate for a genuine merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is presented to us, Sir, in the White\r\n\r\nPaper is not merger. I remember the Minister for\r\n\r\nLabour  in  a speech at Nanyang University  said\r\n\r\n(Straits  Times, 1st September, 1961)  that  the\r\n\r\nproposed\r\n\r\nconstitutional  set-up is only  a  step  towards\r\n\r\nreunification and towards merger,  but  not  the\r\n\r\nfinal step. That would, in my opinion, be honest\r\n\r\nadmission, that the proposed set-up could  be  a\r\n\r\nhalf-way  house and not a genuine  merger.  This\r\n\r\ntiga  suku  merger  gives,  of  course,  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government a special status,  special\r\n\r\nin  the  sense that we would be like an  adopted\r\n\r\nchild - adopted   by  the  Federation   from   the\r\n\r\nBritish.   Under   the  proposed   set-up,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  State  Government  can  only   govern\r\n\r\nSingapore  under the sufferance of  the  Central\r\n\r\nFederal Government. Although it has more powers - as compared to, say, the Johore State\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nGovernment - the powers and relationship of such a\r\n\r\nSingapore   State  Government  can   be   almost\r\n\r\nequivalent to the powers and relationship of the\r\n\r\nformer City Council in relation to the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment.  There  is,  of  course,  a  certain\r\n\r\ndegree of autonomy, but in the last analysis, it\r\n\r\nis  the  Federal Parliament that shall have  the\r\n\r\nfinal and the decisive say.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall explain in the following few\r\n\r\nminutes   the  relationship  between  a  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  a State Government.  There  are\r\n\r\nthree  types of jurisdiction in the relationship\r\n\r\nbetween   a  Federal  Government  and  a   State\r\n\r\nGovernment   as   contained   in   the   Federal\r\n\r\nConstitution.  First, there is  a  Federal  List\r\n\r\nwhich  contains  all  those subject  matters  or\r\n\r\npowers   which  are  exclusively  under  Federal\r\n\r\njurisdiction. A State Government has  absolutely\r\n\r\nnothing  to  do  with  those  powers  under  the\r\n\r\nFederal List. Second, there is a concurrent List\r\n\r\nwhich  contains subject matters  which  a  State\r\n\r\nGovernment  can administer at the  pleasure  and\r\n\r\nwith   the   general  agreement  of  a   Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Third, there is a State  List  which\r\n\r\ncontains subject matters and powers which remain\r\n\r\nwithin the jurisdiction of a State Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are thus three Lists: a Federal\r\n\r\nList,  a  concurrent List, and a State List.  In\r\n\r\nthe proposed constitutional\r\n\r\nset-up  for  Singapore,  there  would  be   more\r\n\r\nsubject matters included in the concurrent  List\r\n\r\nand  in  the  State List than are given  to  the\r\n\r\nother  States  of the Federation.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nnecessity for me to discuss the powers under the\r\n\r\nFederal  List, because it would have nothing  to\r\n\r\ndo  with the State Government, nor would I spend\r\n\r\ntime  on  the  concurrent  List  because  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided   constitutionally   that   the   final\r\n\r\nlegislative  and  executive  jurisdiction  rests\r\n\r\nwith  the Central Government. Now how about  the\r\n\r\nsubject  matters  in  the  State  List?  Sir,  a\r\n\r\nCentral Government which ii not friendly with  a\r\n\r\nState  Government can restrain or hinder a State\r\n\r\nGovernment in one or two ways from carrying  out\r\n\r\nits  jurisdiction  either under  the  concurrent\r\n\r\nList or under the State List. It\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  do  so  either through the  constitutional\r\n\r\nway,  that  is,  through the  Articles  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitution,    or    through    the    extra-constitutional   way  or   through   both   the\r\n\r\nconstitutional way in conjuction with the extra-constitutional way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in the constitutional way, there are\r\n\r\nmany  Articles  in the Federation  Constitution\r\n\r\nwhich  provide  the  Central  Government   with\r\n\r\npowers  to  make inroads into or to  check  the\r\n\r\nauthority of the State Government. I shall  not\r\n\r\nenumerate these powers because it might lead to\r\n\r\nconfusion here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the extra-constitutional methods, that is,\r\n\r\nmethods which are not necessarily contained  in\r\n\r\nthe  written  Constitution, the most  effective\r\n\r\nway  the Central Government can act against the\r\n\r\nState  Government  is the Central  Government's\r\n\r\ncontrol over financial policy. We have seen how\r\n\r\nthis  is  being  done  in Federal  States  like\r\n\r\nAmerica, Australia and Canada. Needless to say,\r\n\r\nthere   are,   in  addition,  a  multitude   of\r\n\r\npressures  and sanctions which the Central  Gov\r\n\r\nernment  can  enforce  against  a  recalcitrant\r\n\r\nState Government.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be said that the con\r\n\r\nstitutional  proposals outlined  in  the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  giving  the  Singapore State  Government\r\n\r\nsome  measure  of local autonomy are  not  just\r\n\r\nplain  humbug.  The complete  negation  of  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of such autonomy cannot be conducive\r\n\r\nto  an objective appraisal and a discussion  of\r\n\r\nthe merits and demerits of a genuine merger and\r\n\r\nthe  proposed constitutional set-up. But I  say\r\n\r\nthat  such  autonomy as envisaged in the  White\r\n\r\nPaper  can only be effective and valid so  long\r\n\r\nas  the Federation Government concurs or agrees\r\n\r\nor  does  not raise serious objections  to  the\r\n\r\ngeneral   policies  of  the   Singapore   State\r\n\r\nGovernment. As I have said, it is possible  for\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government to revert  back  to\r\n\r\nitself  those subject matters in the concurrent\r\n\r\nList.  On those subject matters in the  special\r\n\r\nState  List for Singapore, which include labour\r\n\r\nand  education, constitutional intervention  by\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government - that is, intervention\r\n\r\nthrough the Articles of the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFederation   Constitution - and/or  constitutional\r\n\r\nsanctions  or pressures exerted by  the  Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment  can  bring a recalcitrant  Singapore\r\n\r\nState  Government to its knees or bring it  into\r\n\r\ndisrepute. There is no doubt, Sir, in  my  mind,\r\n\r\nthat  the  final power and authority  will  rest\r\n\r\nwith the Federal Government. As sovereignty  and\r\n\r\nultimate authority over Singapore now rest  with\r\n\r\nthe  British,  sovereignty will  rest  with  the\r\n\r\nFederal  Parliament. Sir, the Federal Parliament\r\n\r\nwill be the source and fountain of political and\r\n\r\nlegislative power. No doubt, the final authority\r\n\r\ncould  thus  rest  with the  Federal  Government\r\n\r\nwhich controls the Federal Parliament whether it\r\n\r\nbe  a  complete merger or whether it be  a  tiga\r\n\r\nsuku merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it must be stressed that we are not\r\n\r\nobjecting  to the principle of a strong  Central\r\n\r\nFederal  Government.  In  fact,  only  a  strong\r\n\r\nCentral  Federal Government can bring prosperity\r\n\r\nand  stability to a country. But what we  object\r\n\r\nto is the constitutional arrangement whereby the\r\n\r\nmain  purpose of reunification which is to build\r\n\r\na united Malaya would be defeated. In a complete\r\n\r\nmerger, Sir, there would be no autonomy on educa\r\n\r\ntion and labour and various other subjects,  but\r\n\r\nthere  would be a common citizenship.  Singapore\r\n\r\nState  would be like Johore State. In a complete\r\n\r\nmerger, the Singapore State Government will have\r\n\r\nless  powers than under a tiga suku merger,  but\r\n\r\nin  my  view,  the difference in autonomy  of  a\r\n\r\nSingapore State Government in a complete  merger\r\n\r\nand  in  a  tiga  suku merger is, for  practical\r\n\r\npurposes, not of substantial importance. On  the\r\n\r\nother   hand,   the  advantages  of   a   common\r\n\r\ncitizenship will not only provide the foundation\r\n\r\nfor  fostering patriotism and the building of  a\r\n\r\nunited  Malayan nation but also on the principle\r\n\r\nof  one man one vote the people of Singapore, as\r\n\r\ncitizens of a united Federation of Malaya,  can,\r\n\r\nthrough the constitutional machinery, play their\r\n\r\npart  in shaping the course of political  events\r\n\r\nfor the progress of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government has made a\r\n\r\n\"bargain\".  In  exchange for 15 seats  and  some\r\n\r\nmeasure  of autonomy in certain subject matters - for example, education and labour - it is prepared\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconcede   the  basic  principle  of  a   common\r\n\r\ncitizenship for the two territories. I say that\r\n\r\nthe  people  are  not  in  favour  of  such   a\r\n\r\nconstitutional arrangement. The people  want  a\r\n\r\ngenuine merger and a common citizenship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party is in full support of the feelings\r\n\r\nexpressed  in the motion moved by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Labour, because merger evokes a  patriotic\r\n\r\nsentiment and kindles the torch of nationalism.\r\n\r\nNo  true  patriot of Malaya can help but  share\r\n\r\nthose feelings with the Minister for Labour. It\r\n\r\nis   our  basic  policy  to  subscribe  to  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  a united Malaya.  The  amendment\r\n\r\nmoved by the Member for Queenstown brings  into\r\n\r\nprominence the paramount issue in merger, which\r\n\r\nis the citizenship question.

The   whole\r\n\r\nobjection  to the P.A.P. type of merger  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  the  prosperity of  Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nlivelihood  of  the  people  will  be  adversely\r\n\r\naffected (in fact, the Member for Queenstown has\r\n\r\nadmitted  in his speech that nobody in Singapore\r\n\r\nwill be adversely affected), but because in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. type of merger, the interests of  a  few\r\n\r\npolitically  ambitious  individuals - the   real\r\n\r\nmasters  for  whom the Member for Queenstown  is\r\n\r\nworking,  will be unable to stand as  candidates\r\n\r\nand  be elected in the Federation. The interests\r\n\r\nof  a few politically ambitious individuals  are\r\n\r\nthe  real  reason  why they  are  afraid  of  en\r\n\r\ntrusting internal security in the hands  of  the\r\n\r\nnew  Federation  legislature in which  Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  represented. For  unlike  the  genuine\r\n\r\ndemocrats    and   nationalists,    these    few\r\n\r\nindividuals,  in  keeping with Communist  theory\r\n\r\nand  practice,  indulge in open legal  political\r\n\r\nactivities and also\r\n\r\nunderground illegal activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis leaders know that even now\r\n\r\nthe  Internal Security Council has the necessary\r\n\r\npowers  to  deal  with these few individuals  if\r\n\r\nthey go beyond the limit. In entrusting internal\r\n\r\nsecurity, a power which has never been wholly in\r\n\r\nthe  hands of the Singapore Government,  to  the\r\n\r\nelected  Federation Government, there is neither\r\n\r\ngain  nor loss to the Singapore people. However,\r\n\r\nto  the  Communists, there is a great difference\r\n\r\nas  explained by the Prime Minister in his radio\r\n\r\ntalks: \"To be imprisoned by the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists is to be a martyr,  in  the\r\n\r\ncompany  of  Mr Nehru, Dr Nkrumah,  Dr  Banda\r\n\r\nand  many other anti-colonial nationalists.  But\r\n\r\nto  be  locked up by Mr Nehru, Dr Nkrumah,  or\r\n\r\nCol.   Nasser  or  the  Tunku  is  an   entirely\r\n\r\ndifferent   matter,\"  and  hence,  the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis' agitation over internal security being\r\n\r\ntransferred  from  the hands of  the  tripartite\r\n\r\nInternal   Security  Council  to   the   elected\r\n\r\nFederation  Government, in which Singapore  will\r\n\r\nhave a part.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, or its\r\n\r\nreal  masters, know more than anyone  else  that\r\n\r\ntheir   proposal  for  merger,  with   automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of citizenship\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nrights  (a  right which is not even enjoyed  by\r\n\r\nPenang  or  Malacca) will not be acceptable  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation Government. But then,  one  may\r\n\r\nask,  why  did they put forward a  proposal  of\r\n\r\ncapturing  the  Federation Government,  knowing\r\n\r\nvery  well  that  it will be turned  down?  The\r\n\r\nanswer  is  that they do not want a  merger  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage when there is a government  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  which views unfavourably  Communist\r\n\r\nand  pro-Communist activities. What the Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis really want is complete internal self-government,  even  though it  means  prolonging\r\n\r\ncolonial  rule since the British will still  be\r\n\r\nin  charge  of defence and foreign  affairs.  A\r\n\r\ncontradiction  which can only be  explained  by\r\n\r\nthe  fact that they are only fighting for their\r\n\r\nsectional interests.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reunification of Singapore with the Federation\r\n\r\nis     inevitable    because    geographically,\r\n\r\nculturally and economically, Singapore is  part\r\n\r\nof  the Federation. Reunification has been  the\r\n\r\nslogan  of  all genuine nationalists and  anti-colonialists  since  1946.  For   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to go against the aspiration  of  the\r\n\r\npeople will be utter folly. Yet, deep in  their\r\n\r\nhearts,  they  do  not want a merger  with  the\r\n\r\nCentral Government in charge of security. As  a\r\n\r\nway  out  of this dilemma, they seek to confuse\r\n\r\nthe  people with a merger proposal that is  not\r\n\r\nacceptable  to  the Federation,  so  that  they\r\n\r\ncould  fight  for complete internal self-government  without  being accused by the  people  of\r\n\r\nprolonging  colonial rule. It was, to  use  the\r\n\r\nwords  of  the Member for Queenstown, \"a  sell-out\", a traitorous move by the Barisan Sosialis\r\n\r\nto   sell  the  independence  and  freedom   of\r\n\r\nSingapore to the British colonial rulers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi accused the P.A.P. of\r\n\r\nwanting to remain in power and therefore  seeks\r\n\r\nthe  Tunku's  help.  He said  that  the  people\r\n\r\nwanted  the  Government to return the  mandate.\r\n\r\nThe  P.A.P. refused to do so. So they  quickly\r\n\r\nbrought  about the merger issue and  threatened\r\n\r\nthe  people  with  imaginary  consequences   if\r\n\r\nmerger  does  not take place. The move  by  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. according\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  the  Member  for Changi, was an  attempt  to\r\n\r\nenable  the  \"ruling class\"  to  continue  their\r\n\r\ncontrol over the people and stay in power for  a\r\n\r\nfurther period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as with all phoney socialists\r\n\r\nand  anti-colonialists, they always  speak  with\r\n\r\ntheir  tongues in their cheeks. Far  from  being\r\n\r\neager to remain in office, we were the first  to\r\n\r\nsuggest  returning  the mandate  to  the  people\r\n\r\nafter the Hong Lim by-election. But who were the\r\n\r\npeople  who  resisted most  strenuously  at  our\r\n\r\nParty  conference? None other than  the  13  ex-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen  and  Parliamentary Secretaries  who\r\n\r\nare  now in the Barisan Sosialis. They were  the\r\n\r\npeople  who  stood  up one after  the  other  to\r\n\r\noppose the suggestion of holding a referendum on\r\n\r\nwhether  the P.A.P. should continue  in  office.\r\n\r\nThey  were  scared of the prospect of having  to\r\n\r\nreturn  the mandate to the people for fear  that\r\n\r\nthey  would  not be re-elected.  This  fear  was\r\n\r\nsubtly  and  effectively exploited  by  the  Com\r\n\r\nmunists. Overnight, we found them, one after the\r\n\r\nother, standing up for the pro-Communist line of\r\n\r\n\"internal  self-government without the  I.S.C.\",\r\n\r\nand  finally  culminating in their  betrayal  of\r\n\r\ntheir  comrades  and  Party.  Ever  since  their\r\n\r\nfailure to capture the Party and the Government,\r\n\r\nthey now demand we should return the mandate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us remind the Member for Changi and all\r\n\r\nthe  other Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen that the\r\n\r\nvery people who should return the mandate to the\r\n\r\npeople  are  the ex-P.A.P. Assemblymen  who  had\r\n\r\ndefected to the Barisan Sosialis. They were  the\r\n\r\ncandidates who stood on the P.A.P. platform  and\r\n\r\nwere  elected on P.A.P. policies, one  of  which\r\n\r\nwas   independence  through  merger  which   was\r\n\r\nendorsed by the people years ago. They signed  a\r\n\r\npledge in April 1959 in which they categorically\r\n\r\npledged  to support the policy of merger between\r\n\r\nthe  Federation and Singapore as set out in  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Central Executive Committee's  statement\r\n\r\npublished  in  the 4th Anniversary  Souvenir  in\r\n\r\n1958.  They  also  pledged to resign  from  this\r\n\r\nAssembly if they were to\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe expelled from the Party.

The  ex-P.A.P.  Assemblymen  have  been\r\n\r\ntrapped  into  stabbing their own  comrades  and\r\n\r\nindulging in shameful betrayal of the Party.

I remember on the  eve  of\r\n\r\nthe  second purge by the Lim Yew Hock Government\r\n\r\nin  1957,  the Member for Havelock, as the  then\r\n\r\nSecretary of the Tanjong Pagar Branch,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngathered the Branch Committee and vowed solemnly\r\n\r\nbefore  the P.A.P. symbol that all should  stand\r\n\r\nsolidly  together  and face  the  coming  storm.\r\n\r\nBrave words indeed! However, when the storm  and\r\n\r\nthe  rain did come, the Member for Havelock  and\r\n\r\nsome  of  his  friends found themselves  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation, leaving those of us who have not the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to thump our chest and express  our\r\n\r\ncourage  and  comradeship to re-gather  and  re-organise the abandoned flock to put them in this\r\n\r\nAssembly.  Mr Speaker, Sir, for any merger  pro\r\n\r\nposed  to succeed, it must be based on realistic\r\n\r\nprinciples  and must be practical.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nfair  and  just both to the people of  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the people of the Federation. It is  futile\r\n\r\nto   fight   for  the  exclusive  interests   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  yet  expect  the  Federation  to\r\n\r\naccept  such  a plan, which is what the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis amendment seeks to do. It is no use pre\r\n\r\ntending that the Barisan Sosialis' proposals are\r\n\r\npractical   or  acceptable  to  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore or the Federation. The Tunku has  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  is not prepared to agree to  automatic\r\n\r\nconversion of citizenship because of the liberal\r\n\r\ncitizenship laws in Singapore in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, the Barisan Sosialis have demonstrated\r\n\r\ntheir  insincerity  in their  stand  on  merger.\r\n\r\nFirst, they suggest the entry of Singapore as  a\r\n\r\nconstituent State of the Federation like  Penang\r\n\r\nor Malacca. Since then, however, this demand for\r\n\r\nmerger  on  the basis of Penang or  Malacca  has\r\n\r\nbeen  dropped  and  even in the  7\ufffd  hours  long\r\n\r\nspeech  of  the  Member for Queenstown  in  this\r\n\r\nAssembly,  not a single reference  was  made  to\r\n\r\nthis  original stunt of theirs. They  must  have\r\n\r\nrealised  after the radio forum,  in  which  the\r\n\r\nMember   for  Queenstown  participated  in   his\r\n\r\ncapacity as Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis  on\r\n\r\n22nd  September,  1961, that  for  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nenter the Federation on the same basis as Penang\r\n\r\nand Malacca would mean the disenfranchisement of\r\n\r\nabout 340,000 present Singapore citizens. And to\r\n\r\nextricate themselves from their predicament, the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown spent nearly 7\ufffd hours  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly  to  prove  that  the  Federation\r\n\r\nParliament  has the power under  Article  22  to\r\n\r\ngrant automatic citizenship rights\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto  Singapore  citizens - a  fact  which  no  one\r\n\r\ndisputes.

Is it fair  and  just\r\n\r\nthen to our brothers in Penang and Malacca  who\r\n\r\ndid not enjoy such rights?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, being only interested in\r\n\r\nadvancing  the  sectional interests  of  a  few\r\n\r\nambitious politicians to stand for election  in\r\n\r\nKelantan  and Trengganu, is prepared  to  wreck\r\n\r\nthe merger proposals. Are the vast majority  of\r\n\r\nordinary people who have no political ambitions\r\n\r\nof   standing  for  election  in  Trengganu  or\r\n\r\nKelantan willing to allow their interests to be\r\n\r\nsacrificed in this way?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown accused the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nof  selling out the interests of the people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   because  we  did  not   press   for\r\n\r\nautomatic citizenship rights. But what are  the\r\n\r\ninterests that we have been accused of  selling\r\n\r\nout?   In   our  merger  proposals,  will   any\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen  lose his  citizenship?  The\r\n\r\nanswer is \"No\". The White Paper setting out the\r\n\r\nheads  of  agreement for a merger  between  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of  Malaya  and  Singapore   states\r\n\r\ncategorically that \"all Singapore citizens will\r\n\r\nkeep their citizenship\" and \"Singapore citizens\r\n\r\nwill  continue to enjoy their state rights  and\r\n\r\nprivileges within Singapore.\" Yet, we have  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Changi deliberately saying in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that Singapore citizens will lose  their\r\n\r\ncitizenship   on   merger  under   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nproposals.  Whom  is  he going  to  bluff?  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, if a man has decided to close his\r\n\r\nmind to all reason and logic, then you can  sit\r\n\r\nand  talk till the cow comes home and you  will\r\n\r\nnot  be able to make him move from the position\r\n\r\nthat  he  has taken.

In addition, every  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen  on merger will gain Federal nationality\r\n\r\nand  will  be  able, for the first time  in  150\r\n\r\nyears   of   colonial  domination,  to   proudly\r\n\r\nproclaim   to  be  national  of  an  independent\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya or Malaysia.  Perhaps  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  would feel prouder  still  if\r\n\r\nthey  would  remain  as British  subjects  in  a\r\n\r\ncomplete internal self-government?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any merger proposal, the object must be the\r\n\r\nfurtherance  and protection of the interests  of\r\n\r\nthe   broad  masses  of  the  people,  not   the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  a  few ambitious politicians  who\r\n\r\nwant  to  stand for election in Ipoh or Kuantan.\r\n\r\nThis is what precisely the P.A.P. type of merger\r\n\r\nproposals  seek to achieve. No  one  can  be  so\r\n\r\nblind as to ignore the fact that as a result  of\r\n\r\n16   years  of  separation  engineered  by   the\r\n\r\ncolonial  rulers, differences of  interests  and\r\n\r\nattitudes  exist today. Such differences  cannot\r\n\r\nbe  wiped out overnight without causing consider\r\n\r\nable  unhappiness to the people. And instead  of\r\n\r\nbringing  about merger in a happy  and  peaceful\r\n\r\nmanner,  there  may be chaos and  violence.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P., being realists and taking cognizance  of\r\n\r\nthe   objective  political  conditions  existing\r\n\r\ntoday, has decided to reserve for itself reserve\r\n\r\npowers  in Labour and Education and other social\r\n\r\nservices  with a view to achieving merger  in  a\r\n\r\npeaceful way.

There will  be  restric\r\n\r\ntions  to  the  granting  of  certain  types  of\r\n\r\nbusiness  and contracts to non-Malays.  Many  of\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen will not  even\r\n\r\nbe   sitting  in  this  House  and  those  whose\r\n\r\npolitical  ambitions lead them to  betray  their\r\n\r\ncolleagues  and the P.A.P. by defecting  to  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  will  find  their  hopes   of\r\n\r\nstanding  for  election  vanish  into  thin  air\r\n\r\nbecause the Barisan Sosialis type of merger will\r\n\r\nmean  the  immediate application of English  and\r\n\r\nMalay  as  the official languages for the  State\r\n\r\nAssembly as well as the Federal Parliament.

It\r\n\r\nwas  a  path  that every man, however desperate,\r\n\r\nmust avoid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me make clear\r\n\r\nto  this House that no one disagrees with him in\r\n\r\nprinciple, that the education system in both the\r\n\r\nFederation  and Singapore must be  the  same  to\r\n\r\nmake for one national identity and loyalty.  The\r\n\r\ndifference  between the P.A.P. and  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  on this educational issue  is  one  of\r\n\r\ntime,  of  when to merge the present differences\r\n\r\ninto  one.  First, let me explain what immediate\r\n\r\nacceptance  of  the Federation education  policy\r\n\r\nmeans vis-a-vis Chinese education. This is vital\r\n\r\nand  one which the Barisan Sosialis leaders seek\r\n\r\nto  gloss  over in their public statements.  The\r\n\r\nmost  unhappy feature and one which evokes  most\r\n\r\nheat  and  agitation  by  the  Chinese  in   the\r\n\r\nFederation  in  respect  of  the  Rahman   Talib\r\n\r\nEducation   Report   is  that   of   medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction  and examination. The  Rahman  Talib\r\n\r\nReport  provides that the medium of  instruction\r\n\r\nin  Chinese Primary Schools shall be in Chinese.\r\n\r\nAs  for the Chinese Secondary Schools, the  main\r\n\r\nmedium  of  instruction shall  be  in  Malay  or\r\n\r\nEnglish  with  Chinese language  and  literature\r\n\r\nreduced  to  one-third of curriculum  time.  How\r\n\r\never,  the  examination's for the  Lower  School\r\n\r\nCertificate    and    the   Federation    School\r\n\r\nCertificate,   the  two  officially   recognised\r\n\r\ncertificates for jobs in Government and teaching\r\n\r\nservice,  and  for  further  studies,  shall  be\r\n\r\nconducted  in Malay or English. It is true  that\r\n\r\nChinese\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncould   still   be  used  as  the   medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction  in Chinese Secondary Schools,  but\r\n\r\nsuch  schools would become independent schools,\r\n\r\ni.e., receive no government aid. All of us will\r\n\r\nremember, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there  was  an\r\n\r\nimmediate  reaction  from the  Chinese  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation   and  charges  of  elimination   of\r\n\r\nChinese   culture  and  education  were   made.\r\n\r\nChinese  education became the central issue  in\r\n\r\npolitical agitation against the Federation  Gov\r\n\r\nernment by communal parties such as the  P.P.P.\r\n\r\nand  even  in  the Sosialist Front  and  Rahman\r\n\r\nTalib  Report led to a split between the  Malay\r\n\r\nand   the  Chinese  wings  and  the  threatened\r\n\r\nresignation of its President, Ahmad  Boestaman.\r\n\r\nIn   Singapore,   scathing   attacks - no   doubt\r\n\r\nheartily supported by the Barisan Sosialis - were\r\n\r\nmade  by  Nanyang University students in  their\r\n\r\npublication.  These  were the  results  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation  where the Chinese do not  form  the\r\n\r\nmajority of the population. If the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis type of proposal is  accepted\r\n\r\nand,  overnight,  the Chinese  school  students\r\n\r\nfind themselves having to learn in Chinese  but\r\n\r\nbe  examined in English or Malay or  be  taught\r\n\r\nand   examined  in  Malay  or  English  in  the\r\n\r\nsecondary   schools,  the  position   will   be\r\n\r\ncatastrophic   in   Singapore   where   it   is\r\n\r\nessentially very much a Chinese city.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> They go on strike like\r\n\r\ntoday!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Far from achieving\r\n\r\nnational unity, the Barisan Sosialis  type  of\r\n\r\nmerger proposal will\r\n\r\ninvite  mass  agitation and rallies  and  lead\r\n\r\neventually   to   violence   and   chaos   and\r\n\r\nsuppression. It would be indeed, in the  words\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Queenstown, \"a path leading\r\n\r\nto national disunity and to war\". As it is now\r\n\r\nwith  equal  treatment  in  Singapore  to  all\r\n\r\nstreams  of  education  with  the  medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction  in the respective mother  tongues\r\n\r\nin  primary and secondary schools and also  in\r\n\r\nNanyang  University and full grant-in-aids  to\r\n\r\nschools, some students in Chinese schools,  no\r\n\r\ndoubt,  forming part of the present  political\r\n\r\nstruggle  promoted by the M.C.P. through  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, the unions\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand   rural  organisations,  are   already\r\n\r\nagitating against secondary school examinations,\r\n\r\nmind  you, in their own mother tongue.  On  this\r\n\r\nagitation, it is also of interest to  note  that\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis' official organ gave  full\r\n\r\ncoverage  and  support to it. Does  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis seriously suggest that it is willing to\r\n\r\naccept  the present Federation education  policy\r\n\r\nimmediately? Perhaps the answer is already found\r\n\r\nin  their conspicuous silence on this subject in\r\n\r\ntheir open statements and public rallies. May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest to the Barisan Sosialis that if they are\r\n\r\ngenuine   and  sincerely  believe  in  accepting\r\n\r\nimmediately  the  Federation  education  policy,\r\n\r\nthey  should  first put their  proposal  to  the\r\n\r\npeople and seek their support? For us, while  we\r\n\r\nbelieve in the principle of one common education\r\n\r\npolicy for the whole of Malaya, nevertheless, we\r\n\r\nare of the opinion that this, being an emotional\r\n\r\nissue, should come about more gradually,  if  we\r\n\r\nare  to team from the Federation experience,  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  path  to  merger  will  not  lead  to\r\n\r\ndisunity and war.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that if merger is\r\n\r\nto  be achieved in a peaceful manner with no one\r\n\r\nlosing  any  of  its existing rights,  then  the\r\n\r\namendment  moved  by the Member  for  Queenstown\r\n\r\nwill not achieve it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot seek merger by taking up fixed\r\n\r\npositions. Problems of merger must be approached\r\n\r\non   the   basis   of  \"seeking  concord   while\r\n\r\nmaintaining  differences\", a  slogan  which  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and their real  masters  have\r\n\r\ndropped,  perhaps  a bit too quickly  when  they\r\n\r\nfind  that this slogan no longer works to  their\r\n\r\nadvantage. Mr Speaker, Sir, in the latter  half\r\n\r\nof  1960  the M.C.P. was pursuing the policy  of\r\n\r\n\"struggle and unite\" vis-a-vis the P.A.P.  Later\r\n\r\nwhen  they  discovered that the P.A.P. was  not\r\n\r\nstooging  for them, the slogan of  the  day  \"to\r\n\r\nseek concord while maintaining differences\"  was\r\n\r\nmouthed  by  every front organisation  at  their\r\n\r\nmeetings.  But  when  they discovered  that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. was   not  prepared  to  accept   their\r\n\r\nobjective of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfighting for full internal self-government but,\r\n\r\ninstead,  was pursuing its avowed objective  of\r\n\r\nindependence through merger, which everyone  of\r\n\r\nthe 13 Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen was pledged\r\n\r\nto  fight for and on which they were elected by\r\n\r\nthe  people, the slogan was dropped. Since then\r\n\r\nthey  have  resorted  to unproved  slogan  like\r\n\r\n\"sellout\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi said that just because\r\n\r\nthey, the Barisan Sosialis, fought\r\n\r\nfor  self-government and not merger, therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. ruling class accused them  of  pro-British. The Member for Changi then went on  to\r\n\r\nexplain why the Barisan Sosialis demanded self-government   instead   of   merger    and    be\r\n\r\nindependent.  He  explained  that  the  British\r\n\r\nGovernment came from abroad and not elected  by\r\n\r\nthe   local  people.  Similarly,  the   Malayan\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  came  from  outside  and  not\r\n\r\nelected by the Singapore people. As such, under\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. merger  proposal,  Singapore  will\r\n\r\nstill remain as a self-governing State with its\r\n\r\ndefence, internal security, and foreign affairs\r\n\r\ntransferred  from the British  colonialists  to\r\n\r\nthe Right-wing Government of Malaya.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, can anyone still doubt that\r\n\r\nthe Member for Changi and the Barisan Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthe so-called genuine anti-colonialists, prefer\r\n\r\nthe  British  colonialists to  the  independent\r\n\r\nMalayan  Government? Since the British colonial\r\n\r\nGovernment came from outside and not elected by\r\n\r\nthe  local  people, and the Malayan  Government\r\n\r\nalso  came from outside and not elected by  the\r\n\r\nlocal  people, why not continue to be  a  self-government under the British colonialists?  Why\r\n\r\ntransfer   the  power  over  defence,  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  foreign affairs to  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists? Are not the British  colonialists\r\n\r\njust  as good, if not more efficient? Why fight\r\n\r\nfor  a  merger although it means that Singapore\r\n\r\nwill  be  an  integral part of the  independent\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya? Why give up the status of\r\n\r\nBritish  subjects,  and  therefore  under   the\r\n\r\nprotection  of the mighty imperial  power,  for\r\n\r\nnationals  of the new Federation of  Malaya  or\r\n\r\nMalaysia?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell the Member for Changi and the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis leaders that  the  P.A.P.,  as\r\n\r\ntrue  Malayan nationalists, would rather entrust\r\n\r\nour   defence,  internal  security  and  foreign\r\n\r\naffairs  to  the independent Malayan  Government\r\n\r\nelected by the Singapore and Malayan people, who\r\n\r\nare  our own brothers and sisters and who  share\r\n\r\nwith us the same common aspiration, than to  the\r\n\r\nBritish colonialists who are not elected by  the\r\n\r\nlocal people and responsible only to the British\r\n\r\npeople.  We  would  rather carry  a  Malayan  or\r\n\r\nMalaysian passport than a British passport.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Changi is still confused by\r\n\r\nhis own dialectics and cannot see any difference\r\n\r\nbetween  the  British colonialists  and  Malayan\r\n\r\nnationalists, then I pity the students under his\r\n\r\ntutelage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. regard Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  Federation of Malaya as one people  in\r\n\r\none   territorial  unit.  The  people   of   the\r\n\r\nFederation are our brothers and sisters  in  the\r\n\r\nsame   family  coming  together  after  a   long\r\n\r\nseparation  by  the colonial rulers.  No  doubt,\r\n\r\nafter  16  years  of separation, certain  differ\r\n\r\nences of views may have developed, but we regard\r\n\r\nthese differences, to use the phrase of Chairman\r\n\r\nMao  as  \"the  internal  contradictions  of  the\r\n\r\npeople\"  which  can be resolved  in  a  friendly\r\n\r\nmanner. The leaders of the Barisan Sosialis, who\r\n\r\nare  supposed to be ardent followers of Chairman\r\n\r\nMao, appear to have applied the analysis in  the\r\n\r\nwrong   direction.  Instead  of  regarding   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government and  the  people  as  our\r\n\r\nbrothers  and  our peoples, they  have  regarded\r\n\r\nthem  as foreigners and enemies; and the British\r\n\r\nas  their  friends to whom they are prepared  to\r\n\r\nentrust  defence  and foreign relations  of  the\r\n\r\nState.  The  Barisan Sosialis, in  accusing  the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government  of  being  a  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment  policing interests for  the  British\r\n\r\nand  attempting  to  subjugate  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  have  declared  their  intention  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen the forces in the Federation in their\r\n\r\nstruggle against the Federation Government  and,\r\n\r\nconsequently,   demanded  a   general   election\r\n\r\nimmediately   so  that  they  can  capture   the\r\n\r\nFederation.

This is the language\r\n\r\nof  war.  The differences between Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe   Federation,  according  to   the   Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  analysis, are not to  be  regarded  as\r\n\r\nonly  the internal contradictions of the people,\r\n\r\nbut antagonistic contradictions between enemies.\r\n\r\nIn short, Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the\r\n\r\nmotion is not a genuine desire to seek merger by\r\n\r\nthe  Barisan Sosialis, but a camouflage to wreck\r\n\r\nmerger.   The  Barisan  Sosialis  today   stands\r\n\r\ncondemned as the enemy of reunification  of  the\r\n\r\ntwo  peoples,  the enemy of Malayan nationalism.\r\n\r\nThey  have  become instead the  allies  of  anti\r\n\r\nnational  elements. They would  rather  carry  a\r\n\r\nBritish  passport  than  the  passport   of   an\r\n\r\nindependent Federation.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>4.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the Member for Hong Lim has  said\r\n\r\nthat  there has been a lot of confusion. I agree\r\n\r\nwith  him. I could not agree with him more.  But\r\n\r\nthe  trouble  is  that he confuses  us  more  by\r\n\r\nsaying that he supports both the motion and  the\r\n\r\namendment.  In fact, I am not very sure  whether\r\n\r\nhe  is not a little confused himself because the\r\n\r\nmotion\r\n\r\nreads:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'. . .this House affirms and declares that the\r\n\r\nfirst  objective of all true patriots of  Malaya\r\n\r\nis to achieve the reunification of these\r\n\r\ntwo territories in a merger-'\r\n\r\n<br><br>I repeat \"in a merger\" -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.'.\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  does  not say a phoney merger or  a  genuine\r\n\r\nmerger  or a confederation merger. It just  says\r\n\r\n\"in  a merger\" - a merger as the world understands\r\n\r\nas  dictionaries  or political  books  give  its\r\n\r\nmeaning. But here we have been sitting  - I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  the seventh day - and debating  on  what\r\n\r\nsort  of  merger: phoney merger, genuine merger,\r\n\r\ncomplete  merger or three-quarters  merger.  All\r\n\r\nthat the motion asks us to answer is, \"Do you or\r\n\r\ndo  you  not want merger?\" If we want a  merger,\r\n\r\nthen  let us sit down and discuss the motion  on\r\n\r\nthe White Paper. If we do not want merger, it is\r\n\r\nnonsense to ask what kind\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  merger.  What  is the use of  talking  about\r\n\r\ndetails  of  merger when we do not want  merger?\r\n\r\nThis  motion just seeks to ask us, \"Do you  want\r\n\r\nit  or not? If you want it, we will proceed.  If\r\n\r\nnot, we will not proceed.\" What happens? We have\r\n\r\nsat down for seven days and, as you put it. Sir,\r\n\r\nconfusion  mounts on confusion until  I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether it has confused the Member for Hong\r\n\r\nLim  so  much  that  he is supporting  both  the\r\n\r\nmotion and the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Straits Times of 24th November,\r\n\r\npage  12, on the speech of the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\nin  regard  to  the  amendment  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  to  the  motion of  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour,  there  were very big headlines  in  the\r\n\r\nhalf-inch  letters - you  seldom  get   such   big\r\n\r\nheadlines - that that amendment gives two meanings\r\n\r\nto the word \"merger\". My question is, \"Does it?\"\r\n\r\nThe  answer  is \"No.\". The Member for  Anson  is\r\n\r\nreported  also to have said that  he  could  not\r\n\r\nhave  agreed more with the Member for  Cairnhill\r\n\r\nin  that  merger could only mean merger - this  is\r\n\r\nfrom   the   same  newspaper - with  the  complete\r\n\r\nreunification  of the two territories,  and  the\r\n\r\ncitizens  completely identified as  citizens  of\r\n\r\nthe  Federation. He continued, however,  to  say\r\n\r\nthat   that   was  what  the  Barisan   Sosialis\r\n\r\namendment is seeking to clarify. Sir, if  merger\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the citizens of the two territories\r\n\r\nare  completely  identified as citizens  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  it  would also mean that  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  would  enjoy all  the  rights  of  the\r\n\r\nFederal  citizens.  It is not  just  these  two - automatic   citizenship  and  the  entrance   of\r\n\r\nSingapore into the Federation - but all the rights\r\n\r\nof the Federal citizens. May I ask, Sir, whether\r\n\r\nthe  entrance of Singapore as the twelfth  State\r\n\r\nand  the automatic citizenship for Singapore are\r\n\r\nthe  only  two  conditions  that  constitute   a\r\n\r\ngenuine   merger?  No.  There  are  many   other\r\n\r\nconditions  and  rights that  comprise - what  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis call - a genuine  merger.  These\r\n\r\ntwo  conditions on their own do not in  any  way\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  genuine  merger  or  a   complete\r\n\r\nmerger. Then why should we mention these two and\r\n\r\nleave out all the others,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nespecially when on the motion no one has  tried\r\n\r\nto  specify any type of merger? And rightly so,\r\n\r\nwhy should they?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the motion is defeated, what will be\r\n\r\nthe  effect of it? The motion asks, \"Do you want\r\n\r\na  merger?\" If the motion is defeated,  then  we\r\n\r\nshow that we do not want a merger. I think, Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  nonsense  then to go on to  discuss  the\r\n\r\nmotion  on  the White Paper. If this House  does\r\n\r\nnot  want  that sort of merger at all,  we  must\r\n\r\nfirst  indicate whether we want or do  not  want\r\n\r\nmerger.  It  may  be  argued,  Sir,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nunderstood.  It  has been said  several  times - outside this Chamber, inside and everywhere - that\r\n\r\nall  Parties want merger, that everyone realises\r\n\r\nthat  the separation between the territories  is\r\n\r\nartificial  and  that  we  all  agree  that  the\r\n\r\nreunification   of   the  two   territories   is\r\n\r\ninevitable.  It  may be said  it  is  taken  for\r\n\r\ngranted.  This  is exactly what  the  motion  is\r\n\r\nseeking to confirm and to place on record. As  I\r\n\r\nread  it,  it just says, \"Do you want merger  or\r\n\r\nnot?\" It has naturally not specified whether  it\r\n\r\nis  the  P.A.P. phoney merger  or  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   genuine   merger   or   the    S.P.A.\r\n\r\nconfederation type of merger, but just merger as\r\n\r\neveryone  in the world understands it.  Had  the\r\n\r\nmotion  made an attempt at limiting the  meaning\r\n\r\nof  the word by saying this merger or the P.A.P.\r\n\r\ntype of merger or even the merger which is under\r\n\r\ndiscussion,  then  probably  the  amendment   is\r\n\r\njustified;  we do not want that type of  merger.\r\n\r\nBut  then the motion has not specified what type\r\n\r\nof  merger. So we take it that the word \"merger\"\r\n\r\nmeans  what  the  world  understands  the   word\r\n\r\n\"merger\" to mean.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been here, Sir, I think, seven days,\r\n\r\nnot listening to whether we want merger or not,\r\n\r\nand  if  we want merger why, and if we  do  not\r\n\r\nwant merger, why do we not want it, but hearing\r\n\r\naccusations and condemnations to and fro,  from\r\n\r\nP.A.P. to  ex-P.A.P. and back again.  We  have\r\n\r\nbeard  very  strong words used - as a  matter  of\r\n\r\nfact, I believe to many of us, the strongest we\r\n\r\nhave  heard  in  our lives.  We  have  heard  a\r\n\r\nprotest  in  the  form of a  marathon  7\ufffd-hour\r\n\r\nspeech  and  we are presented with  a  proposed\r\n\r\namendment. We have been debating it  for  about\r\n\r\nseven days. And all because\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  were  asked, \"Do you want a merger or  not?\"\r\n\r\nEverybody says, \"We want a merger.\" But we spent\r\n\r\nseven days arguing.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think for the record\r\n\r\nthis is the sixth day.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I beg your pardon, Sir.\r\n\r\nYou  see, even I am confused! Honestly, Sir,  is\r\n\r\nthe amendment necessary? Does it make the motion\r\n\r\nany  more acceptable? Many people think yes, but\r\n\r\nI  say  no,  Sir.  On the contrary,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nbecause  we  do  not  want  genuine  merger   or\r\n\r\nautomatic  citizenship. But if the amendment  is\r\n\r\naccepted - in other words, the motion becomes a Ba\r\n\r\nrisan  Sosialis type of merger,  because,  as  I\r\n\r\npointed  out  just  now, a genuine  merger  will\r\n\r\nconsist of more than two rights, and to put just\r\n\r\nthe two rights that the Barisan Sosialis wish to\r\n\r\nemphasise would make it a Barisan Sosialis  type\r\n\r\nof   merger - then  it  would  probably  be   less\r\n\r\nacceptable  than just the word \"merger\"  as  the\r\n\r\nworld understands it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, merger means that\r\n\r\nall  rights enjoyed by Federal citizens will  be\r\n\r\nconferred on the present Singapore citizens  who\r\n\r\nwill  be Federal citizens. There are many rights\r\n\r\nenjoyed  by the Federal citizens. If we  are  to\r\n\r\ncatalogue all those rights, I am afraid that the\r\n\r\namendment is going to be a bigger document  than\r\n\r\nthe White Paper itself, because I am sure we too\r\n\r\nhave  our  own  ideas  of  how  the  people   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  should  benefit  by  a  merger,   and\r\n\r\nprobably  all the other Parties here have  their\r\n\r\nown  ideas too besides the Barisan Sosialis. The\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis must remember that probably the\r\n\r\nFederation  too  has  its own  idea  of  what  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger is and what the  benefits  of  a\r\n\r\ngenuine  merger should be like. If an  amendment\r\n\r\nis  necessary to define the type of  merger,  it\r\n\r\nshould include all the demands and all the terms\r\n\r\nthat  all  the Parties here want, and it  should\r\n\r\nalso  contain the interpretation and demands  of\r\n\r\neverybody. Can you imagine the chaos, Sir, if we\r\n\r\nall  start  putting  in amendments  on  what  we\r\n\r\nparticularly want to stress?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Sir, the only question\r\n\r\nbefore the House in the motion is, do we  or  do\r\n\r\nwe not agree -\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...that the first objective of all true\r\n\r\npatriots  of  Malaya is to achieve  the  reunifi\r\n\r\ncation of these two territories in a merger of\r\n\r\nSingapore with the Federation of Malaya.'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>If  we do, let us vote for the motion. If we  do\r\n\r\nnot,  then  let us vote against it.  Or  is  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis saying that this House affirms\r\n\r\nand  declares  that the first objective  of  all\r\n\r\ntrue  patriots  of  Malaya  is  to  achieve  the\r\n\r\nreunification  of  these two  territories  in  a\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  type of merger?  Because,  in\r\n\r\neffect,  that is what it is going to be if  that\r\n\r\namendment is\r\n\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been quite a lot of legal\r\n\r\nbrains  talking on this amendment and the  whole\r\n\r\nquestion  of merger from the legal aspect.  Some\r\n\r\nphilosophers  have offered philosophies  of  the\r\n\r\ndifferent types and theories of merger. Sir, may\r\n\r\nI  take it from a psychological angle? In moving\r\n\r\nthe  motion,  I  presume that the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour hopes that the House will support him. In\r\n\r\nasking for a genuine merger, I take it that  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Queenstown hopes that the Federation\r\n\r\nwill grant it. And yet what do they do, Sir? The\r\n\r\nMinister,  in hoping that we all - including  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis - will   support   him   starts\r\n\r\nattacking the Barisan Sosialis, saying all sorts\r\n\r\nof  things about them, hoping that by that means\r\n\r\nhe is going to get them to support him. I do not\r\n\r\nunderstand the psychology of that, Sir. And then\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Queenstown, in trying to get the\r\n\r\nTunku  to  agree to a genuine merger,  says  all\r\n\r\nsorts  of  things about him and his  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  Member  for  Nee Soon  no  doubt  tries  to\r\n\r\nexplain that in a democratic government  we  are\r\n\r\nallowed to criticise, that he is not criticising\r\n\r\nthe  man but only what he and his Government are\r\n\r\ndoing. That is all very well, Sir, but I do  not\r\n\r\nsee   the  need  to  threaten.  The  Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown wants to get merger from the Tunku by\r\n\r\ntelling  him  that  after a genuine  merger  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis will unite with the  Socialist\r\n\r\nparties  in  the  Federation  to  overthrow  the\r\n\r\nTunku's  Government. I do not see the  logic  or\r\n\r\nthe  psychology of that, Sir. You want  a  thing\r\n\r\nfrom  a person and yet you say to him, \"Give  it\r\n\r\nto  me so that I can do harm.\" If the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown  is  going to ask  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nLabour  to  go for a drive with him so  that  he\r\n\r\nwill rob him,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nI am sure he will not disclose it and say, \"Look\r\n\r\nhere, Ahmad, come for a drive with me so that  I\r\n\r\ncan rob you when we reach a solitary place.\"  If\r\n\r\nhe  says that. I maintain that he is not serious\r\n\r\nin  wanting the Minister to go with  him  for  a\r\n\r\ndrive. Probably he does not want the Minister to\r\n\r\ngo  and that is why he says that. The threat  is\r\n\r\nput  there  to  deter the Minister  from  going.\r\n\r\nProbably it is because the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nis   meeting  his  girl  friend  down  there  or\r\n\r\nprobably even meeting someone whom he should not\r\n\r\nmeet.  I do not know. But the main idea is  that\r\n\r\nby  saying that, the intention is not to get the\r\n\r\nMinister  to come along.

All  those\r\n\r\nwho are taking this examination are doing so  of\r\n\r\ntheir  own  free will and because their  parents\r\n\r\nwish  them to do so. And it is the duty  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, in a democratic country, to see that\r\n\r\nno  student is denied the right to sit for  such\r\n\r\nan  examination if he so wishes it  and  if  his\r\n\r\nparents desire it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant that despite the intimi\r\n\r\ndation  and picketing, about 1,900 students,  or\r\n\r\nmore  than 60 per cent of the students, sat  for\r\n\r\nthe examination. The so-called boycott organised\r\n\r\nby Communist elements has not succeeded, but the\r\n\r\nfact  that they have now been reduced  to  using\r\n\r\nschool children as pawns and expendable material\r\n\r\nin  their  anti-merger campaign is  significant.\r\n\r\nFor   Chinese  schools,  Chinese  education  and\r\n\r\nculture  have  often been their rallying  points\r\n\r\nfor  mustering innocent people to man  Communist\r\n\r\nbarricades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has reason to believe that these\r\n\r\nCommunist cadres, in their desperation, will now\r\n\r\nincite  those innocent and misinformed  students\r\n\r\ninto resorting to more reckless and rougher\r\n\r\ntactics.  The boycott was only incidentally,  to\r\n\r\nprevent  students  from taking the  examination.\r\n\r\nThe real objective of the picketing was to force\r\n\r\na  clash  between  the  police  and  the  school\r\n\r\nchildren  in the hope that some school  children\r\n\r\nwould  get  hurt, and in this way the Communists\r\n\r\ncan  use  such incidents to mount public feeling\r\n\r\nagainst  the Government. It is typical of  these\r\n\r\nCommunist  leaders  that, in  order  to  achieve\r\n\r\ntheir  ends,  they are ready to do  this  safely\r\n\r\nbehind  the  skirts  of school  children.  These\r\n\r\ngreat  revolutionaries, not daring to  challenge\r\n\r\nthe  Government directly, are willing to  gamble\r\n\r\nwith the safety of children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government refused to fall into the\r\n\r\nCommunist  trap.

Squads  of  students  are  being\r\n\r\norganised  and may visit the homes  of  students\r\n\r\nwho  are  taking the examination  to  intimidate\r\n\r\nthem  into abandoning the examinations.

Further  evid\r\n\r\nence  that  the Barisan Sosialis and their  pro-Communist  mentors are behind this manoeuvre  to\r\n\r\nbring about violent clashes between students and\r\n\r\npolice  can be seen from the role that Mr  Fong\r\n\r\nSwee  Suan,  who is closely connected  with  the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  as  its  Central   Executive\r\n\r\nCommittee  member, is playing in this  dangerous\r\n\r\ngame,  dangerous  not  for  Mr  Fong  and   his\r\n\r\nfriends,  but for the school children they  have\r\n\r\nduped  and  intimidated into doing  foolish  and\r\n\r\ndangerous things.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the posters and banners supporting the\r\n\r\nboycott  and picketing are prominently displayed\r\n\r\non the buses of the Tay Koh Yat Bus, Company and\r\n\r\nthe  Paya Lebar Bus Company, the workers of whom\r\n\r\nare  controlled by Mr Fong Swee  Suan  and  his\r\n\r\nfriends,  like  Mr  Chen  Saye  Jame   in   the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Bus  Workers'  Union.

For the past five months\r\n\r\nSingapore  has  endured a period of  trials  and\r\n\r\ntribulations  and a rash of strikes  because  in\r\n\r\nJune    1961,    certain    Communist-controlled\r\n\r\npolitical  forces decided that  the  forthcoming\r\n\r\nconstitutional  talks  for independence  through\r\n\r\nmerger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment  were to be frustrated at  any  cost.\r\n\r\nControversy over the 4: 2 system for the Chinese\r\n\r\nSecondary School system was first raised by some\r\n\r\nmembers of the Chinese School Teachers' Union in\r\n\r\ntheir  letter  to the Minister dated  9th  June,\r\n\r\n1961.  At  the  height of the  controversy  some\r\n\r\nindividuals of the Nanyang University  Students'\r\n\r\nUnion  tried  to involve students by  announcing\r\n\r\ntheir  intention  to convene a  meeting  of  all\r\n\r\nmonitors  of  Chinese secondary schools  at  the\r\n\r\nHokkien  Association on 9th August,  1961.  This\r\n\r\nmove  was  checked  when principals  refused  to\r\n\r\nallow  their  students to  attend  the  meeting,\r\n\r\nwhich was accordingly called off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th October, 1961, the 4:2 system\r\n\r\ncontroversy  was  amicably  resolved  with   the\r\n\r\nChinese  Schools Committee-Teacher  Association,\r\n\r\nan  organisation regarded by Chinese educational\r\n\r\nbodies  themselves  as the highest  organisation\r\n\r\nfor Chinese education in Singapore. The Minister\r\n\r\nagreed  to  their  request to  allow  those  who\r\n\r\nfailed  the  Government Secondary IV examination\r\n\r\nbut passed the internal school examination to be\r\n\r\npromoted  to  upper secondary classes.  Then  on\r\n\r\n15th   October,  1961,  the  Nanyang  University\r\n\r\nStudents'  Union issued a Press statement  which\r\n\r\nstated  that  whilst they accepted in  principle\r\n\r\nthe   settlement  reached  with  the  Committee-Teacher  Association,  they  however  considered\r\n\r\nthat  the requirement that only those who passed\r\n\r\nthe Government Secondary IV examination can take\r\n\r\nthe  Government  Upper Secondary II  examination\r\n\r\nwas  \"unreasonable\" and should be withdrawn. The\r\n\r\nfirst shot in a new controversy was fired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an attempt to whip up agitation and draw\r\n\r\nattention to themselves, these student agitators\r\n\r\nheld meetings in schools and resorted to acts of\r\n\r\nhooliganism. They destroyed tables and chairs in\r\n\r\nsome schools; cut cables of the public address\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\nsystem  in  order  to  prevent  Principals  from\r\n\r\nspeaking  to students. They went from  house  to\r\n\r\nhouse  to  intimidate parents and  students  who\r\n\r\nintended  to take the examination,  and  in  one\r\n\r\ncase  in  the. Chinese High School, they carried\r\n\r\naway  the  gate  of the school.  They  also  dis\r\n\r\ntributed  leaflets falsely giving the impression\r\n\r\nthat  the Government was out to destroy  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 15th November, 1961, a delegation of 19\r\n\r\nstudents  (ten  boys and nine girls)  from  five\r\n\r\nschools,  namely, Yock Eng, Chinese High,  Chung\r\n\r\nCheng, Chung Hwa Girls and the Nan Chiau, Girls'\r\n\r\nHigh called at the Ministry of Education at  Kay\r\n\r\nSiang Road at 2.30 p.m. to see the Minister. The\r\n\r\nMinister was then in Kuala Lumpur attending  the\r\n\r\nColombo Plan Ministerial Conference. The student\r\n\r\ndelegation, however, returned to the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation the following day, 16th November,  and\r\n\r\nwhilst  the number of students was reduced  from\r\n\r\n19   to   14,  the  school  representation   was\r\n\r\nincreased  from  5  to  7,  which  now  included\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from Sin Min High School and Seh\r\n\r\nChuan  High  School. This time, my Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  decided  to see  them.  He  patiently\r\n\r\nexplained and answered their representations  as\r\n\r\nfollows.  Firstly, there could be no  change  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry's  decision that  only  those  who\r\n\r\npassed  the  Government Secondary IV examination\r\n\r\ncan  take  the  Government  Upper  Secondary  II\r\n\r\nexamination. This is normal educational practice\r\n\r\nanywhere in the world: that a person should pass\r\n\r\nthe  lower examination before proceeding to  the\r\n\r\nhigher  examination. Secondly, that the detailed\r\n\r\nsyllabuses of the Upper Secondary course will be\r\n\r\navailable  before  the end  of  the  month.  The\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary stressed that the  langu\r\n\r\nage  medium of instruction would remain Chinese.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is no intention or possibility of\r\n\r\nusing conversion to the 4: 2 system to eliminate\r\n\r\nChinese    education.   Fourthly,    when    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  asked  the  delegation\r\n\r\nwhether  they were going to boycott  the  Govern\r\n\r\nment examination, they all replied that they had\r\n\r\nno such intention.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although all Chinese secondary schools\r\n\r\nhad closed for the vacation after completion  of\r\n\r\nthe   year-end  school  examinations   on   20th\r\n\r\nNovember, 1961, it was reported that 121  chairs\r\n\r\nand  34  desks  were  found  to  be  maliciously\r\n\r\ndamaged in the Dunman Government Chinese  Middle\r\n\r\nSchool, obviously with a view to preventing  the\r\n\r\nschool from being used for holding examinations.\r\n\r\nOn  the same day, it was reported that pamphlets\r\n\r\nwere  being  distributed  in  the  River  Valley\r\n\r\nGovernment Chinese Middle School. The  same  day\r\n\r\nthe Chinese Schools Teachers Union also released\r\n\r\nto  the Chinese Press the full contents of their\r\n\r\nletter  addressed  to  the Minister  dated  13th\r\n\r\nNovember  1961, stating that the requirement  to\r\n\r\nrestrict candidates taking the Government  Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary II Examination to those who have first\r\n\r\npassed  the  Government Secondary IV Examination\r\n\r\nas \"unreasonable\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st November, 1961, both the Sin Chew Jit\r\n\r\nPoh and the Nanyang Siang Pau gave publicity to\r\n\r\nthe  text  of  a circular issued by  individual\r\n\r\nschool supervisors and/or principals of the  27\r\n\r\nChinese secondary schools explaining to parents\r\n\r\nthe  importance of the Government  Secondary  N\r\n\r\nexamination,   as  the  certificate   will   be\r\n\r\nequivalent  to  the  present Government  Senior\r\n\r\nMiddle  III Certificate for purpose of  seeking\r\n\r\nemployment  in  the Government or  joining  the\r\n\r\nTeachers' Training College or Polytechnic.

I  can\r\n\r\nfully understand his position in seeking to make\r\n\r\nknown  to  the  people  of  Singapore  what   he\r\n\r\nbelieves  to be attempts to subvert  our  school\r\n\r\nyouth  to  improper political activities.  I  am\r\n\r\nwith  him  in  his  appeal that the  educational\r\n\r\nauthorities  should  have  the  support  of  the\r\n\r\nparents, and the\r\n\r\ninformation he has given as to the way they  can\r\n\r\ngive  that support. I can but regret for myself,\r\n\r\nSir, that it should\r\n\r\nhave  been found necessary that, instead of just\r\n\r\nmaking that statement as a statement of fact  of\r\n\r\ninformation and of appeal, he should have sought\r\n\r\nto associate it - I mean, if he wants to\r\n\r\nattack  them, I have no brief for them - not  only\r\n\r\nwith  an  attack upon his former  comrades,  but\r\n\r\nalso  with  the  merger  debate.  We  have   had\r\n\r\nconfusion enough on this issue. Instead of being\r\n\r\nable  to  debate the White Paper alone, we  have\r\n\r\nhad  this  irrelevant merger motion brought  in,\r\n\r\nand now we have this further confusion added.  I\r\n\r\ncannot but regret that there is - you will forgive\r\n\r\nme  if I say so, but I say quite honestly,  Sir,\r\n\r\none\r\n\r\ngets  the impression that he is seeking to  make\r\n\r\ncapital  out  of  what is not  only  an  unhappy\r\n\r\nposition,  but  also for purposes  of  a  debate\r\n\r\nwhich quite obviously is not\r\n\r\ngoing too well for the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add one or two points, Sir. The\r\n\r\nMinister had seen fit to mention the name  of  a\r\n\r\nperson  I  know  well - Tommy Koh Thong  Bee - in  a\r\n\r\ncontext which suggests that he is a Communist\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  pro-Communist. I say to you, Sir, that I am\r\n\r\nprepared to pledge my life that that man is  no\r\n\r\nCommunist; he is no pro-Communist, and he is no\r\n\r\nrunning dog of the Communist. He is one of  the\r\n\r\nfinest human beings I have ever met, and I have\r\n\r\ncomplete faith in his genuine dedication to the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  processes as we  understand  it.  I\r\n\r\nhave had occasion, Sir, to watch that man daily\r\n\r\nfor  months, and I do say it is unfair, because\r\n\r\nhe  may have been seen somewhere near a school,\r\n\r\nto  use  his name publicly in this Assembly  in\r\n\r\norder to make suggestions of that character.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only another small matter.

In this statement,  it  is  seen\r\n\r\nclearly that the meeting between the\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstudents'   delegation  and  myself   has   been\r\n\r\ndistorted. The former Parliamentary Secretary to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Education  and  I  have  been\r\n\r\nseeing  each other here almost :very day  during\r\n\r\nthe  period  of  this sitting.  If  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  really want to find out the truth  and\r\n\r\nthe  details  regarding this question  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, they can come forward or, a friendly\r\n\r\nbasis  and  ask  us what it is all  about.  They\r\n\r\nshould  not  have  published a  statement  which\r\n\r\ndistorted the facts in their party organ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual truth is this. I heard the former\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation say that this\r\n\r\nquestion  of the 4:2 and 3:3 systems  should  be\r\n\r\nbrought up before the Prime. Minister and  other\r\n\r\nMembers  for consultation. If there was anything\r\n\r\nwrong  with  this  4:2  system  he  should  have\r\n\r\nbrought  up this question earlier and  tried  to\r\n\r\nfind  a way out. But unfortunately this question\r\n\r\nwas  only brought up after the 13 Members of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis had left, the P.A.P.  We  know\r\n\r\nthat  teachers'  organisations  and  educational\r\n\r\nbodies  have given their valuable views on  this\r\n\r\nsystem and we have sincerely considered them. We\r\n\r\nhave  met representatives off teachers  and  the\r\n\r\nBoard  of  Directors and we have accepted  their\r\n\r\nproposals  and  suggestions.  In  one  of  their\r\n\r\nproposals they stated that they were afraid that\r\n\r\nthe  4:2  system  would reduce  the  period  for\r\n\r\nmiddle  school students from six to four  years.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the Ministry of Education's ruling\r\n\r\nWas  that  students  who failed  the  Middle  IV\r\n\r\nexamination  would  not be  promoted.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason, the educational bodies were afraid  that\r\n\r\nthe  period for middle school students would  be\r\n\r\nreduced  from  six to four years.  In  order  to\r\n\r\navoid  any  misunderstanding, we accepted  their\r\n\r\nviews,  that  is, all students  who  pass  their\r\n\r\nschool examinations internally would be promoted\r\n\r\ntogether  with those who pass the Government  ex\r\n\r\naminations.   That  was  a  special   concession\r\n\r\nbecause, in English schools, if a student should\r\n\r\nfail the School Certificate Examination he would\r\n\r\nnot  dream  of  sitting for  the  Higher  School\r\n\r\nCertificate Examination, and even those who pass\r\n\r\nthe School Certificate Examination\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust have at least three Credits before they can\r\n\r\nsit  for  the H.S.C. Examination. In the Chinese\r\n\r\nschools  those who fait the public  examinations\r\n\r\nbut  pass  the  school  examinations  could   be\r\n\r\npromoted to higher classes. In this case, we are\r\n\r\nmaking  a  very special concession by  accepting\r\n\r\nthe  opinion  of  the  educational  bodies.  The\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  of  Chinese  school   teachers,\r\n\r\ndirectors,  and  committee  teachers  have   put\r\n\r\nforward  a  suggestion that those  students  who\r\n\r\nhave  failed the Middle IV examination can  only\r\n\r\nsit for the Upper Secondary II examination after\r\n\r\na supplementary examination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if we accept the proposal of the, students,\r\n\r\nthat would mean that if we fail the Malay Std. I\r\n\r\nexamination we can even sit for the  Malay  Std.\r\n\r\nII  examination. That would also mean that  even\r\n\r\nif we fail the School Certificate examination we\r\n\r\ncan   sit  for  the  Higher  School  Certificate\r\n\r\nexamination. This would cause great confusion in\r\n\r\nthe   education  system.  Therefore,   in   this\r\n\r\nrespect, when the student representatives met me\r\n\r\n(I  spent almost an hour with them), I explained\r\n\r\nto  them patiently, and I believe I never showed\r\n\r\nanger  before  the  students.  After  the   talk\r\n\r\nlasting for about an hour, I opened the door and\r\n\r\nlet them out one by one. Was that not courteous?\r\n\r\nI  do  not know what courtesy means if that  was\r\n\r\nnot so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the questions they brought up, I explained\r\n\r\nto  them  that,  firstly,  the  cancellation  of\r\n\r\ncertain restrictions, that is to say, that those\r\n\r\nwho  have  failed the Secondary  IV  examination\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to sit for the Upper Secondary\r\n\r\nII  examination, is unreasonable. If we accepted\r\n\r\nthis,  it  would mean that examinations  do  not\r\n\r\nexist  in  the education system. Secondly,  they\r\n\r\nasked  me  whether it was the intention  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  use  English  as  a  medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction in place of Chinese. I assured  them\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government had no such intention.  We\r\n\r\nwill  never use English instead of Chinese as  a\r\n\r\nmedium   of  instruction  in  Chinese   schools.\r\n\r\nRegarding  the  curriculum  and  syllabus,  they\r\n\r\nasked me when the Government is going to publish\r\n\r\ndetails of the syllabus. I told them it would be\r\n\r\ndone soon. When I refused to accede to their\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndemands,  one of the representatives accused  me\r\n\r\nof  having  an  intention to  eliminate  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. I told them that I myself came from a\r\n\r\nChinese school and that some of my children  are\r\n\r\nin   Chinese  schools,  and  that  it  would  be\r\n\r\nnonsense  for  me to say that  I  am  trying  to\r\n\r\neliminate   Chinese  education.  I   told   them\r\n\r\ncarefully and courteously, \"Is there any country\r\n\r\nin South-East Asia in which Chinese education is\r\n\r\nso  well  developed and so free to take its  own\r\n\r\ncourse?\"  And I also told them that  if  at  all\r\n\r\nChinese   education  should  be  eliminated   in\r\n\r\nfuture, it would be they who would do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a statement published in the organ of the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis,  the  meeting  between   the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives and me was distorted. This organ\r\n\r\nof  the  Barisan Sosialis should have  clarified\r\n\r\nthe   whole,   situation  before  publishing   a\r\n\r\nstatement. In the statement, it is said that\r\n\r\nthe Parliamentary Secretary rejected the claims,\r\n\r\nand turned his face against the reasonable talks\r\n\r\nabout this claim.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, when the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary was quoting,  he  should\r\n\r\npoint  out that the statement was given  by  the\r\n\r\nstudents,  so as not to give a false  impression\r\n\r\nto the people. This was not what was said by the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Member for Upper Serangoon has  reason\r\n\r\nto doubt the statement published in the paper. I\r\n\r\nam also very happy to know that the organ of the\r\n\r\nBarisan   Sosialis  has  made   a   mistake   in\r\n\r\npublishing this statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was talking of the statement published in the\r\n\r\norgan  of  the Barisan Sosialis. May I  continue\r\n\r\nquoting?  \"What we are against is that  the  4:2\r\n\r\nsystem  should not be used to sieve out  Chinese\r\n\r\nstudents,  and we say that this is a  stumbling-block  to the development of Chinese education.\"\r\n\r\nThis  statement continues to say that if,  after\r\n\r\nreformation,  English is used  as  a  medium  of\r\n\r\ninstruction in Chinese schools, then it will  be\r\n\r\na   clear   step  taken  to  eliminate   Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. You will see, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that\r\n\r\nduring\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  meeting  I told them clearly  and  assured\r\n\r\nthem that there would be no such thing as using\r\n\r\nEnglish  as a medium of instruction in  Chinese\r\n\r\nschools. But they said so in their statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is another point. A report in the\r\n\r\norgan  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  says  that  a\r\n\r\nreporter  of the organ interviewed the students\r\n\r\nand  he noted that there were many slogans  and\r\n\r\nbills posted in the schools and canteens. These\r\n\r\nposters  urged the Government to  withdraw  the\r\n\r\nrestriction. This means that the organ  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis has sent a reporter to  visit\r\n\r\nthe  schools and the people. The last paragraph\r\n\r\nof  this  statement says that there  were  some\r\n\r\nslogans  saying, \"We must steadfastly safeguard\r\n\r\nthe  students  of Chinese schools  and  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. Students! Students! We must not be\r\n\r\nafraid of storm and rain! The Chinese students\r\n\r\nwant  to  speak  their  minds.  There  will  be\r\n\r\nflowers blooming in Chinese education.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to waste any more time on this\r\n\r\nstatement,  Mr Speaker, Sir. The Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  has  said that these  students  have\r\n\r\nsome   connection  with  the  Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nbecause of this Press report. We feel that  any\r\n\r\nresponsible paper should not publish at  random\r\n\r\na  statement  of students without  making  sure\r\n\r\nabout it or consulting the Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education.  Therefore,  the  situation  it\r\n\r\npresent  is very sad to many of us, because  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, students in Chinese schools can  sit\r\n\r\nfor  public  examinations using  Chinese  as  a\r\n\r\nlanguage to answer questions. We know that this\r\n\r\ndoes not exist in the Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noted that irresponsible politicians\r\n\r\nare  now trying to exploit students and agitate\r\n\r\nthem  to boycott the examinations. They  accuse\r\n\r\nus of not allowing students who have failed the\r\n\r\nSecondary  IV examination to sit for the  Upper\r\n\r\nSecondary  H  examination. We  have  said  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  no  country in the world  that  will\r\n\r\nallow  such a thing to happen, i.e.,  to  allow\r\n\r\nthose who have failed in a lower examination to\r\n\r\nsit  for  a  higher examination.  Any  rational\r\n\r\npeople will not dream of such a thing. I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to find out what are the views of Members\r\n\r\nof the Barisan Sosialis on this matter. They\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncannot  make use of this as an excuse to agitate\r\n\r\nstudents to boycott the examination. They cannot\r\n\r\nmake  use of this as an excuse to say that  this\r\n\r\nis a move of the Government to eliminate Chinese\r\n\r\neducation. It would be ridiculous if  they  said\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the student representatives met me, they\r\n\r\nsaid that they represented all the Senior Middle\r\n\r\nII,  III and Secondary IV students in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI  told them that that might not be so. I  asked\r\n\r\nthem,   \"Are  you  sure  all  the  students   in\r\n\r\nSecondary   IV   classes   will   boycott    the\r\n\r\nexamination?\"  They said that  there  were  some\r\n\r\n1,900  students who were not afraid of them  and\r\n\r\nthey  went to sit for their examinations  today.\r\n\r\nThat means to say that these representatives did\r\n\r\nnot  tell  the  truth when they said  that  they\r\n\r\nrepresented  all the students in  Singapore.  It\r\n\r\nhas been proved that the agitators are only some\r\n\r\nof  the  students  who have  been  exploited  by\r\n\r\npoliticians  whose aim is to create trouble  and\r\n\r\nchaos,  so  that  the  people  in  general  will\r\n\r\nbelieve  that this Government has the  intention\r\n\r\nto destroy Chinese education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the statement given by the\r\n\r\nstudents'  representatives. It is a  very  funny\r\n\r\nstatement - the  so-called Secondary  IV  Students\r\n\r\nConference Pro-tem Committee. Somebody will come\r\n\r\nto  the meeting and then another will second it.\r\n\r\nLet us read a few paragraphs of the statement:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All these students in Chinese Secondary\r\n\r\nIV classes are young people who are loyal to\r\n\r\nChinese education. In order to safeguard\r\n\r\nChinese education, in order to see that Chinese\r\n\r\neducation is not destroyed, we come forward\r\n\r\nfirmly to defeat all those who are trying to do\r\n\r\nharm to Chinese education. Our parents\r\n\r\nhave,  by  difficult means sent  us  to  Chinese\r\n\r\nSchools  to receive education. Our teachers  are\r\n\r\ntrying their best to educate us. So in order\r\n\r\nnot to disappoint the goodwill and well wishes\r\n\r\nof the parents and teachers, we swear that we\r\n\r\nwant to be fighters of our education.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Then  there  is  the slogan \"Long live  national\r\n\r\neducation!

We  see some Members in  this  House\r\n\r\nsuch  as the Member for Hong Lim and the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Anson, do not know the full story about the\r\n\r\nsituation. I only came to know about it when the\r\n\r\nstudents sent me their statement. So I  came  to\r\n\r\nknow  that  there must be something wrong  about\r\n\r\nthis matter, and I felt that it was correct  for\r\n\r\nme  to  publish such an item of news. Therefore,\r\n\r\nin our paper, we published the\r\n\r\nstatement issued by the students which was\r\n\r\nsuppressed by the Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Education said just now that the boycott  of\r\n\r\nthe examination by students came as a result  of\r\n\r\nagitation by the Barisan Sosialis. I would  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  them this. In the time of the  Lim  Yew\r\n\r\nHock  Government,  there were also  boycotts  of\r\n\r\npublic  examinations,  and  at  that  time   the\r\n\r\npresent Prime Minister was the legal adviser  to\r\n\r\nthe students' organisation. Does that mean that,\r\n\r\nas legal adviser, the Prime Minister was at that\r\n\r\ntime sympathetic to the action of the students?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes.

I was not  the\r\n\r\nlegal adviser to the students union in 1953.  As\r\n\r\nI have\r\n\r\nexplained in my radio broadcast, I came to  know\r\n\r\nthem  in 1954, through the famous King George  V\r\n\r\nPark  incident.

Therefore, we considered\r\n\r\ncarefully  what attitude we must  adopt  towards\r\n\r\nthis  matter. We felt that before  we  knew  the\r\n\r\nwhole  truth, it would be better for us  not  to\r\n\r\nmake any decision just yet. In the course of dis\r\n\r\ncussion, some Committee members asked whether we\r\n\r\nshould  issue a statement on the reformation  of\r\n\r\nChinese  secondary education. When we considered\r\n\r\nit, we felt it was not proper for us to issue  a\r\n\r\nstatement.  We  felt that if we should  issue  a\r\n\r\nstatement asking the students to sit for or  not\r\n\r\nto  sit  for the examination, then we  would  be\r\n\r\ngiving the Government a chance to accuse  us  of\r\n\r\ndoing things behind the scenes. We know that  we\r\n\r\nare  now  in  such  a  situation  that  whatever\r\n\r\nhappens,  whether  it be some unrest  or  strike\r\n\r\nthat takes place, we may be accused of being the\r\n\r\nagitators. I personally believe that if some  of\r\n\r\nthe  leaders  in  the  City Council  strike  had\r\n\r\nhappened  to  be  leaders  and  members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis, we would have been accused  of\r\n\r\ncreating  social  unrest and be  again  detained\r\n\r\nunder   the  Preservation  of  Public   Security\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, on the question of students and\r\n\r\neducation, we decided to be very careful  before\r\n\r\nissuing any statement -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> On a point of information,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b> resumed his seat.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis wants to find  out  the  whole\r\n\r\ntruth, how is it that their Party organ did  not\r\n\r\nfind  out the news regarding the principals  and\r\n\r\nthe teachers themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  have  never  published  any  editorial\r\n\r\nregarding the matter of\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  students in our Party organ.

The Minister was not very  truthful\r\n\r\nabout it. As far as I know, the P.A.P. actually\r\n\r\ndid  not want to implement the 4:2 system. What\r\n\r\nit   wanted  to  implement  was  the  four-year\r\n\r\nsystem,  to  reduce  the  number  of  years  of\r\n\r\nChinese secondary education by two years, i.e.,\r\n\r\nfrom that of six years to four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Chinese pamphlet issued by the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Culture,  wherein  is  the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech  of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for  1960.\r\n\r\n[Indicating] It was delivered in this  House  on\r\n\r\nthe 20th of July, 1960. There was one section in\r\n\r\nthe  speech  on education. It is at page  22  of\r\n\r\nthis  pamphlet.  It states that,  based  on  the\r\n\r\nprinciple of equal treatment, the Government has\r\n\r\ntaken  steps to unify all the education  systems\r\n\r\nof  the  different languages. Primary  education\r\n\r\nhas  a  six-year system. In the  final  year  of\r\n\r\nprimary education, students will have to sit for\r\n\r\na school - leaving examination. This public examin\r\n\r\nation will be held for the first time this year.\r\n\r\nThe  number of years of secondary education will\r\n\r\nalso be unified into that of a four-year system.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, let me repeat this. Secondary\r\n\r\neducation will have a unified four-year  system.\r\n\r\nIt has not been stated that it is going to be  a\r\n\r\n4:  2  system. In this statement, it  is  stated\r\n\r\nthat  it  is the objective of the Government  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  common  examination  in  all  the  four\r\n\r\nstreams of education.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, will you please refer to\r\n\r\nVol. 13 of our Hansard -\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b> rose -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> On a point of order.

The P.A.P. Government is implementing\r\n\r\nthe  reformation introduced by the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment in respect of Chinese education.  Why\r\n\r\nis  it  that  it is only this year that  Chinese\r\n\r\neducation    circles   have   expressed    their\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction? It is because  from  next  year\r\n\r\nonwards, Chinese secondary schools will not have\r\n\r\nSenior  III  and Senior II like the old  scheme.\r\n\r\nThere   will   be  no  more  of  such   classes.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  many  students  will  be  facing   a\r\n\r\nsituation where they will have no more chance of\r\n\r\nstudying in Senior II and III. Chinese education\r\n\r\ncircles   have  also  expressed  dissatisfaction\r\n\r\nabout this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one occasion, I pointed this out to the\r\n\r\nPrime   Minister   when   I   was   still    his\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary. I asked  him  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   wanted   to  change   the   Chinese\r\n\r\nsecondary education system,\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  why  the Government had not consulted  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretaries before such an action\r\n\r\nwas  taken.  The Parliamentary Secretaries  met\r\n\r\nand  wrote  a letter addressed to the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\nEducation. I later received a very long letter\r\n\r\nfrom the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nlabelled  \"Confidential\".  It  accused  me   of\r\n\r\nraising this point in my letter and also blamed\r\n\r\nme for writing such a letter.

I feel we must  look\r\n\r\nclearly  at the situation today. The  debate  on\r\n\r\nthis matter today is incidental. As a matter  of\r\n\r\ncourtesy,  at 5.30 p.m. today, the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  had to inform the representatives  of\r\n\r\nthe people in this House as to what is happening\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  He will then inform  the  people\r\n\r\nabout  the situation through the newspapers  and\r\n\r\nthe  radio. He has done so in this House  purely\r\n\r\nas  a  matter of courtesy. The Barisan  Sosialis\r\n\r\nsaid  that  this was unreasonable and that  they\r\n\r\nwanted a debate on this. So we accepted at  once\r\n\r\nthe motion for this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better put the\r\n\r\nrecord  straight. The motion for the adjournment\r\n\r\nwas  suggested  from the Chair as  a  procedural\r\n\r\ndevice  in  order  that all  opinions  could  be\r\n\r\nexpressed on this statement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  we  must therefore thank you  for  such  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion because, by having a free  debate  on\r\n\r\nthis matter, all those inside this House and the\r\n\r\npeople   outside   will  see  clearly   in   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers that the 13 Members of the Barisan So\r\n\r\nsialis  have  said  nothing  on  this  important\r\n\r\nmatter.   They  have  only  uttered  some   Live\r\n\r\nsentences  about this matter. I have  calculated\r\n\r\nthat  carefully. Actually they  can  speak  very\r\n\r\nwell  if they have speeches written out for them\r\n\r\nby people behind\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe scenes. They can then go on talking for some\r\n\r\nseven  hours. We really admire the  energy  they\r\n\r\nhave  spent  on their speeches. Their  tone  was\r\n\r\ndifferent.  But all of a sudden,  without  their\r\n\r\nbackseat drivers, they cannot make a clear stand\r\n\r\non this important matter. We can now clearly see\r\n\r\nthat  it was the Editor-in-chief of their  Party\r\n\r\norgan - he  was not the Editor-in-chief  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. organ  but only one of the  editors - who\r\n\r\nwas  quite eloquent. But what has he said?  Has\r\n\r\nhe  touched on the main question of the  boycott\r\n\r\nof the examination? What is the attitude of the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  towards the  boycott  of  the\r\n\r\nexamination? Do they want some 3,000 students to\r\n\r\nlose their chances in education? Or do they want\r\n\r\nto  take  advantage of the situation  to  create\r\n\r\ntrouble  and confusion? I feel that tonight  we\r\n\r\nmust hear the ex-Parliamentary Secretary to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education, because, in my view, his\r\n\r\nattitude  towards this matter is very important.\r\n\r\nWhen we came into power, I told my Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation  that he was educated in  English  and\r\n\r\nthat, therefore, his Parliamentary Secretary had\r\n\r\nto be one who was educated in Chinese or, if pos\r\n\r\nsible, one who had been a Chinese teacher  or  a\r\n\r\nChinese school principal. In this way, he  would\r\n\r\nhave  somebody  who knew Chinese education  full\r\n\r\nwell  to  assist  him.  So  questions  regarding\r\n\r\nChinese education must be referred to the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Upper Serangoon. His opinion must be valued\r\n\r\nbecause  he  is an expert. What is  the  result?\r\n\r\nRegarding the 4:2 system and the 3:3 system,  we\r\n\r\nhad   a   meeting   one  day  of   Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries.   That  was  not   a   confidential\r\n\r\nmeeting.  We had a very open meeting. We  had  a\r\n\r\nvery open talk about matters - [Interruption].  I\r\n\r\nam  sorry - ex-Parliamentary Secretaries. My  ex-Parliamentary  Secretary asked me,  when  I  was\r\n\r\nChairman   of   the  Parliamentary  Secretaries'\r\n\r\nmeeting,  \"Why  has the 3:3  system  got  to  be\r\n\r\nchanged  to  the 4:2 system without letting  the\r\n\r\npeople  know beforehand of its contents and  its\r\n\r\naim?\"  Therefore, I entrusted this Question  to\r\n\r\nmy  Education  Minister and his ex-Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary  for them to explain to the Parliamentary  Secretaries what it was all about. It  was\r\n\r\nvery simple. There was no problem\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat  all. This was a decision made years ago.  He\r\n\r\nnever  said  anything about Lim Yew Hock.  I  am\r\n\r\njust  repeating what he said. I do not  remember\r\n\r\nwhether he said anything about the Lim Yew  Hock\r\n\r\nGovernment. He said there was nothing wrong with\r\n\r\nit.  The  contents were not changed. The  system\r\n\r\nwas  only  aimed  at giving the Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nequal  status so that they would have four years\r\n\r\nof  secondary education and two years  of  post-secondary  education, which is the same  as  the\r\n\r\nSchool   Certificate  and  the   Higher   School\r\n\r\nCertificate  examinations  in  English  schools.\r\n\r\nThey  are  all  the  same.  Therefore,  my   ex-Parliamentary   Secretary   said,    \"I    never\r\n\r\ncriticised  the contents of the  system.  All  I\r\n\r\nwant to know is why were we not consulted before\r\n\r\nthis matter was brought up?\" So when I heard him\r\n\r\nsay that the P.A.P. had two failings - one of them\r\n\r\nwas about the handling of the matter - then I knew\r\n\r\nhe  was not a sincere man. He is denying what he\r\n\r\nhad  said. Then he added that he was criticising\r\n\r\nthe Government for having taken a wrong stand on\r\n\r\neducation.  It  is very strange.  When  has  the\r\n\r\nstand  of  the Government become wrong?  Was  it\r\n\r\nafter  the  Hong  Lim or Anson  by-election?  In\r\n\r\nfact, this matter took place before these two by-elections. It is very strange that before he was\r\n\r\nexpelled from the Party, he said nothing to  the\r\n\r\neffect  that our education policy was  basically\r\n\r\nwrong. It is only today that in his eloquence he\r\n\r\nsays  all of a sudden that we are wrong  in  our\r\n\r\nstand  on education. Wrong in our stand? How  is\r\n\r\nit  that  at that meeting he did not review  our\r\n\r\nstand? How is it that he said nothing about  our\r\n\r\neducation policy?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that today we should spend some time on\r\n\r\nthe question of the 3 : 3 and 4: 2 systems. Just\r\n\r\nnow  my  ex-Parliamentary Secretary said that  I\r\n\r\nhad   close  association  with  Chinese   school\r\n\r\nstudents in the past. This question is  not  one\r\n\r\nof  education,  but of students.  They  are  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  questions.  When  the  4:2  and   3:3\r\n\r\nsystems  became a delicate problem, the teachers\r\n\r\nheld  a  meeting  at  the  Happy  World  Stadium\r\n\r\nsometime in August this year - I think it  was  on\r\n\r\n29th  August.  At  that time I showed  them  the\r\n\r\nstand of the Government on Chinese education and\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nChinese  education policy, that  the  policy  on\r\n\r\nChinese education must be decided by the Chinese\r\n\r\nschools themselves. It was not to be decided  by\r\n\r\nus.  It  was  our responsibility to  give  equal\r\n\r\ntreatment  to  the  four streams  of  education.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we brought up this question  for  the\r\n\r\ndecision  of the Chinese schools themselves.  We\r\n\r\nmust  see clearly that although this 4:2  system\r\n\r\nhas been brought up by the Government itself, he\r\n\r\nfinal decision still lies with the principals of\r\n\r\nChinese secondary schools. They can only come to\r\n\r\na  decision after consultation among themselves.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  it is not so easy for them  to  give\r\n\r\ntrouble.  Many  of the teachers  and  principals\r\n\r\nsupport  the 4:2 system which they have  decided\r\n\r\nto  adopt. We have not decided whether we should\r\n\r\nadopt  the  4:2  system. We are  only  making  a\r\n\r\nproposal. That is the first problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second problem is the boycotting of the\r\n\r\nexaminations.  If  today the Government  is  not\r\n\r\ncareful in handling this question rationally and\r\n\r\ntry to solve the conflict between the people  by\r\n\r\nway  of  persuasion,  then  there  may  be  some\r\n\r\ntrouble.  If  we  were just  like  the  colonial\r\n\r\ngovernment which resorted very easily to  police\r\n\r\nand  other  actions, then there could very  well\r\n\r\nhave  been trouble. And if there should  be  any\r\n\r\ntrouble,  then  there would be casualties  among\r\n\r\nthe  students. Then we would be accused of being\r\n\r\nmerciless and relentless. So we decided to  have\r\n\r\nthis  matter determined by the students and  the\r\n\r\nparents themselves. We do not force the students\r\n\r\nto  sit for this public examination. We only say\r\n\r\nthat  this is a step taken to help the  students\r\n\r\nto  have a good future. If they do not like  it,\r\n\r\nwell, they can leave it. We cannot use force  to\r\n\r\ndeal  with  questions  such  as  education   and\r\n\r\nlanguage. Therefore, the students' boycott today - I will not say it is actually a boycott, because\r\n\r\nsome students took the examinations and some  of\r\n\r\nthem  might  be unwell and therefore  failed  to\r\n\r\nturn up because of this - so it does not mean that\r\n\r\nthese  students too are boycotting examinations.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our  responsibility to let them  have  a\r\n\r\nchance  to decide whether they want to  sit  for\r\n\r\nthe   examinations  or  not.  But  it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility    of   the   Barisan    Sosialis - [Interruption].\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Even long before this boycott  of  the\r\n\r\nexaminations  took place, as stated  by  my  ex-Parliamentary Secretary, I am only accusing  the\r\n\r\nback-seat  drivers of the Barisan  Sosialis  for\r\n\r\nhaving  some connection, and therefore I welcome\r\n\r\nthe  suggestion  of  the  Member  for  Anson  to\r\n\r\nestablish a Commission of Inquiry first, to look\r\n\r\ninto  the  trouble as a result of the change  of\r\n\r\nthe  3:3 system to 4:2; and second, to find  out\r\n\r\nwho  is  responsible for this trouble. I do  not\r\n\r\nsay  that  all  the students are boycotting  the\r\n\r\nexamination, because there are some 60 per  cent\r\n\r\nof the students who sat for the examinations. It\r\n\r\nis also the duty of the Commission of Inquiry to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  question whether the  back-seat\r\n\r\ndrivers of the Barisan Sosialis have anything to\r\n\r\ndo  with  boycotting  the examinations.  If  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper Serangoon, who is at  present\r\n\r\nthe  Editor-in-chief of the Party organ  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, feels that his  statement  on\r\n\r\nthis matter   [Interruption].\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

So I\r\n\r\nmust  admit that it was only with his help that\r\n\r\nI   have  learnt  Mandarin  and  made  progress\r\n\r\nthereon. But unfortunately I am unable to  help\r\n\r\nhim  in his political thinking. He is still  at\r\n\r\nthe  stage of young students who are liable  to\r\n\r\nmake  many  mistakes. Because of  the  language\r\n\r\ndifficulty, I could not explain to him  why  it\r\n\r\nwould  be  bad  for  him  to  go  over  to  the\r\n\r\nOpposition.

What\r\n\r\nis  his attitude and stand on the 4:2 system and\r\n\r\nthe  3:3  system and what is his  stand  on  the\r\n\r\nboycott of the examination?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin</b> rose -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Sheng Nam Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Sheng Nam Chin:</b> It is more my asking you\r\n\r\nfor  advice whether it is a point of order.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Serangoon  Gardens  would  like  to\r\n\r\nspeak, and would the Prime Minister give way  to\r\n\r\nhim since he has provoked him into speaking?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order. The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister has, in fact, invited the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Serangoon Gardens to speak. I  take  it  he\r\n\r\nwill give him an opportunity.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Of course, I\r\n\r\nwill. I think this is some kind of contradiction-an internal contradiction among themselves. The\r\n\r\nviews  openly  expressed by their  leaders  have\r\n\r\noriginally been decided by the backseat drivers.\r\n\r\nTheir 'articles have been written by their back-seat  drivers. They have now come here  to  play\r\n\r\nsome spook show. Today it is a free debate. They\r\n\r\ncan   freely  express  their  stand  and   their\r\n\r\nattitude, if they have any stand or attitude  at\r\n\r\nall.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There are only five minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Two minutes\r\n\r\nwill  be enough for me. There are two questions.\r\n\r\nWhat is their stand on the boycott of the common\r\n\r\nexamination,  and  whether  they   support   the\r\n\r\nstudents' boycott? The second question is,  what\r\n\r\n:, their stand on the changing of the 3:3 system\r\n\r\nto  the 4:2 system? Of course, this question can\r\n\r\nbe   put   to  the  Commission  of  Inquiry   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate.  I feel that the Member  for  Anson\r\n\r\nhas  great experience in regard to the  exercise\r\n\r\nof  democratic rights. I think the investigation\r\n\r\nby  the  Commission of Inquiry will give the  13\r\n\r\nAssemblymen a chance to come forward  and  state\r\n\r\ntheir  attitude, and disclose how they made  use\r\n\r\nof  the  students to further their own  ends  to\r\n\r\ndestroy our merger.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I want to make it quite\r\n\r\nclear  that  in this particular case the  debate\r\n\r\nwill end at 8.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> One minute democracy!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, according to our Standing Orders, we do not\r\n\r\nprovide that the motion cannot be debated  until\r\n\r\nwe reach 3.00 a.m. or 4.00 a.m., because we have\r\n\r\nthe  right to set aside the Standing Orders. But\r\n\r\nI  feel  that  they are rather excited.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nthey  have something to tell me. That is  why  I\r\n\r\nwant  to  give  them a chance to speak  on  this\r\n\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.58 p.m.\r\n\r\n                           \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Keng Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Keng Seng (Serangoon Gardens)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not expect\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister to give me only two minutes\r\n\r\nto  speak. I will reply to certain allegations\r\n\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education talked about what I  had\r\n\r\nasked  him  a  few days ago in the C.P.A.  Room\r\n\r\nabout the matters raised today. I have received\r\n\r\nfive  letters from the students, who have  also\r\n\r\nsent  this letter to every Assemblyman. I think\r\n\r\nevery Assemblyman and every political Party has\r\n\r\nreceived  this letter. I will ask  him  how  he\r\n\r\ndeals  with  this matter. But I did not  expect\r\n\r\nthat  he  would keep this matter in  his  heart\r\n\r\nwithout disclosing his intention as to what  he\r\n\r\nwanted to do with it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is this. I have left the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  about four  months.  For  two\r\n\r\nyears,  when I was with the Government,  there\r\n\r\nhad  never been any incident. But today,  when\r\n\r\nanything happens, the Government pushes  every\r\n\r\nresponsibility and blame on my shoulder.  This\r\n\r\nis  not reasonable. Perhaps in case there  may\r\n\r\nbe  further occurrences or incidents, then the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  push  everything  on  to  my\r\n\r\nshoulders. It is not reasonable on the part of\r\n\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that we must remember that\r\n\r\nwhen  this incident occurred recently  at  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretaries' meeting,  we  know\r\n\r\nthat  the  opinion expressed at  this  meeting\r\n\r\nwould not be -\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The present motion for\r\n\r\nadjournment  lapses.
