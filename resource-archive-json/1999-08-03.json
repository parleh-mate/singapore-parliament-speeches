Since then, Mr Akbar Khan's cash offer has closed  with\r\n\r\n359  investors out of more than 172,000 accepting.   Three  more\r\n\r\nprivate  sector  offers  have  been  announced,  but  none  have\r\n\r\nobtained  regulatory  approvals and been formally  made.

Tungku\r\n\r\nAbdullah's  Bintang Melewar Sdn Bhd is offering  Clob  investors\r\n\r\nthree  options, including units in a closed-end investment fund,\r\n\r\nfund management services for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1823</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlarger investors, and custodial services for non-accepting investors.  And the third private sector offer is for\r\n\r\nClob investors to swap their securities for an equal proportion\r\n\r\nof shares in Telekom Malaysia and United Engineers of Malaysia\r\n\r\n(\"UEM\").  The two companies have said that they will purchase\r\n\r\nthe Clob securities at a discount to market prices, and sell\r\n\r\nshares in Telekom Malaysia and UEM at a premium to market\r\n\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any offeror intending to offer Clob investors shares or\r\n\r\nunits  in  investment funds for their Clob Malaysian  securities\r\n\r\nwill  need  to  issue  a  full  prospectus  in  Singapore.  This\r\n\r\nprospectus must be approved and registered with the Registry  of\r\n\r\nCompanies  and  Businesses (\"RCB\").  The RCB verifies  that  the\r\n\r\nprospectuses comply with the disclosure requirements set out  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's Companies Act, and will register the documents if it\r\n\r\nis  in  the public interest to do so.  In evaluating the  public\r\n\r\ninterest,  the  Registrar will take into  account  all  relevant\r\n\r\nfactors   and   considerations.    The   Securities   Investors'\r\n\r\nAssociation of Singapore (\"SIAS\") has urged the Registrar not to\r\n\r\nregister  prospectuses of offers until a comprehensive  solution\r\n\r\nis  in  place for all Clob investors.  The Registrar has  stated\r\n\r\nthat  it will take into account the views of the SIAS, which  is\r\n\r\nthe  only  body  representing investors,   together  with  other\r\n\r\ninformation and views that it may receive regarding the offers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) has stated that it\r\n\r\nwill  not  stand in the way of private sector offers.   However,\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  clear  and reasonable arrangements  for  non-accepting investors to trade their shares on the KLSE.  When the\r\n\r\noffers  are formally made, investors should study the  terms  of\r\n\r\neach  offer  carefully before making a decision.  The  agreement\r\n\r\nbetween  CDP and SCANS contains arrangements for Clob  investors\r\n\r\nto  transfer  their securities to individual  account  with  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian   Central  Depository,  and  thereafter  trade   these\r\n\r\nsecurities on the KLSE.  SCANS continues to be in breach of this\r\n\r\nagreement,   but  investors  should  not  feel  pressured   into\r\n\r\naccepting  any  offers  if  they  are  not  satisfied  with  the\r\n\r\nofferors' terms.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1824</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES is continuing to explore all means of\r\n\r\nresolving the problem. It has been taking advice from lawyers on\r\n\r\nthe legal position.  The SIAS has also announced that it too is\r\n\r\nconsulting lawyers, as the legal position of the Clob investors\r\n\r\nis different from that of the SES.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the SES has submitted a proposal of its own to\r\n\r\nthe  KLSE, suggesting a staggered release of the Clob securities\r\n\r\nover  12 months, without prejudice to its rights under the  CDP-SCANS  Agreement.  The proposed mechanism will result in a daily\r\n\r\nrelease  of Clob securities with the value of a mere  0.015%  of\r\n\r\nKLSE's  total market capitalisation.  This effect on KLSE  stock\r\n\r\nprices  should  be  negligible. This is a  fair  solution  which\r\n\r\ndirectly addresses Malaysian concerns that any solution  to  the\r\n\r\nClob  issue  must  not disrupt the KL market, and  enables  Clob\r\n\r\ninvestors to exercise their rights under Malaysian law to  trade\r\n\r\ntheir   securities.   The  two  exchanges   are   currently   in\r\n\r\ncommunication  on  the proposal.

And if it is not done by the end of the year,  would\r\n\r\nit  lead  to  some legal process being introduced to enable  the\r\n\r\nClob investors to get their shares transfered?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is whether the SES will assist in\r\n\r\nspecial  cases  where there are rights issues or warrants  which\r\n\r\nhave  a  timeframe  expiry, for example, rights  issues  may  be\r\n\r\ncalled  within a certain timeframe or warrants may expire within\r\n\r\nthis year, and whether the SES can approach the KLSE for special\r\n\r\nconsiderations to allow the Singapore owners to either  exercise\r\n\r\ntheir conversion rights for such issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the timeframe, it\r\n\r\nis  not  the  case  that the end-of-the-year  is  the  deadline,\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1825</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe agreement was settled last year (signed in\r\n\r\nSeptember 1998) and was meant to be implemented as soon as\r\n\r\npossible. There is no specific timeframe.  The end-of-the-year\r\n\r\nis not a deadline for the agreement between CDP and SCANS.\r\n\r\nThere have been some statements by one of the offerors, I\r\n\r\nbelieve, that at the end of the year, if this matter is not\r\n\r\nsettled, the shares may be confiscated.  But the SES is taking\r\n\r\nadvice on that, and its advice so far is that even if the shares\r\n\r\nare transferred to the Minister of Finance in Malaysia, the\r\n\r\ntitles still belong to the shareholders and they still have a\r\n\r\nclaim on those shares.  So they are not expropriated.  But we\r\n\r\nare clarifying this position because it is an important point on\r\n\r\nwhich I am sure Clob shareholders would want reassurance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the legal process, as I said in my statement, SES is\r\n\r\ntaking  legal advice and the shareholders' association  is  also\r\n\r\ntaking legal advice.  I do not think we should rule anything out\r\n\r\nbut neither are we seeing that as the only solution.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to when the whole package can be solved, as Members have\r\n\r\nbeen  reading  in  the newspapers recently, the  Malaysians  are\r\n\r\ngearing  up for elections and I think their minds are likely  to\r\n\r\nbe on other weightier matters for the time being.  So it will be\r\n\r\nsome time before the matter would be solved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On special cases like rights issues and warrants, I have to\r\n\r\nask  the Stock Exchange to look into the matter but we will have\r\n\r\nto study the specific cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  said  that to make Clob  legal,  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nauthorities would have to go to Parliament, in other  words,  to\r\n\r\npass a resolution to make Clob illegal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Clob is not illegal.\r\n\r\nEven today, it is not illegal.  Clob is an offshore market.   It\r\n\r\noperates  outside Malaysia, just like people trade in  Malaysian\r\n\r\nshares  in  London or Hong Kong.  It does not require  Malaysian\r\n\r\nlaw to make it legal.

Indeed, it complied with all the rules and\r\n\r\nregulations of the KL Stock Exchange all the many years it was\r\n\r\nin existence.  In September last year, the KL Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nchanged its rules and Clob reassessed its position and decided\r\n\r\nthat it was no longer viable for it to operate under the new\r\n\r\nrules.

If  you  read  my  previous\r\n\r\nstatement in May 1999, I explained that after the matter reached\r\n\r\nan  impasse  at  the  working level,  the  two  Prime  Ministers\r\n\r\ndiscussed  it  in Hanoi when they met during the  ASEAN  Summit.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting, Dr Mahathir came out and told the press  that\r\n\r\nClob  would  be  part of the package of issues to be  negotiated\r\n\r\nbetween the two governments, including water, railway land, CPF,\r\n\r\nand   so   on,   and  he  mentioned  specifically  Clob.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, the Malaysian Government subsequently changed its\r\n\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 17th May this year, Prime Minister Mahathir made a\r\n\r\ndifferent  statement and he said, \"No.  Clob is not one  of  the\r\n\r\nissues.    Clob  is  a  separate  matter.\"   But  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  said, in our negotiations with the  Malaysians,\r\n\r\nthat while this is something we can negotiate separately, by the\r\n\r\ntime  the main negotiations are settled, Clob should not  remain\r\n\r\noutstanding.  So the two can proceed on parallel paths but  they\r\n\r\nmust reach a conclusion at the same time.  But both packages may\r\n\r\ntake  some  time  to  resolve because,  in  the  nature  of  our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  Malaysia, these are not easy problems.   So  we\r\n\r\nwill have to wait and see what happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1827</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister say that he would not expect any form of\r\n\r\nsolution until after the Malaysian general elections?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> I did not quite say that.

In my reply,  I  explained  the\r\n\r\ncomposition   of   SSTD,  that  is,  the  Singapore   consortium\r\n\r\nparticipating  in the SIP project. I also provided  the  amounts\r\n\r\nits  shareholders  had  invested.  I pointed  out  that  as  the\r\n\r\nshareholders include publicly listed companies and MNCs, the SIP\r\n\r\nproject had to be viable.  Any losses sustained would have to be\r\n\r\nmade  public  and  available for scrutiny by  the  international\r\n\r\ninvestment community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also explained the problems faced by the SIP as a result\r\n\r\nof  aggressive  promotion by the Suzhou Government  of  a  rival\r\n\r\nindustrial park next door, the Suzhou New District (SND).\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1998, both sides have carried out\r\n\r\nextensive consultations to resolve the problems. They thoroughly\r\n\r\nevaluated  the progress of the SIP and the experience gained  so\r\n\r\nfar, and sought to work out jointly the best way to advance  the\r\n\r\nproject,   given   the  circumstances.   The  discussions   were\r\n\r\nsuccessful, and resulted in a memorandum of understanding  (MOU)\r\n\r\nsigned  by  the  two sides in Singapore on 28th June  1999,  and\r\n\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially the Singapore side suggested that SND, that is,\r\n\r\nthe  rival, suspended its marketing for five years, so that full\r\n\r\nattention  could be given to accelerate SIP's development.   The\r\n\r\nChinese  side  explained why they could  not  suspend  SND,  but\r\n\r\nexpressed their commitment to SIP's priority status by  offering\r\n\r\nto  coordinate  the marketing of the two parks.   The  Singapore\r\n\r\nside  accepted  the  Chinese explanation of  their  constraints.\r\n\r\nHence, the need for a fundamental review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOU is a comprehensive package redefining the\r\n\r\nobjectives and structure of the project, and resolving many long\r\n\r\noutstanding problems.  Its main points include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Refocusing the SIP project on completing the first 8\r\n\r\nsq km by 1st January 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Transferring majority ownership and management control\r\n\r\nof  CSSD,  the joint venture company from Singapore to China  on\r\n\r\n1st January 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Suzhou Government and the joint venture company to\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  look  after  the  interests  of  SIP  tenants  and\r\n\r\ninvestors.  They guarantee that the changes to the project  will\r\n\r\nnot affect their commitments to these tenants and investors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The Suzhou Government will respect SIP's priority\r\n\r\nstatus  by  recommending  all  suitable  projects  to  the  SIP,\r\n\r\nencouraging  investors  to  choose  SIP,  and  taking   concrete\r\n\r\nmeasures to pre-empt disorderly competition between SIP and SND.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The Suzhou Government will encourage\r\n\r\npopulation from Suzhou old city to move to SIP so as to\r\n\r\naccelerate SIP's development and growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Both sides will accelerate the adaptation of\r\n\r\nSingapore's  experience.   Beyond  1st  January  2001,  software\r\n\r\ntransfer  will  continue  through attachments  and  training  of\r\n\r\nChinese officials in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) Both sides have also settled all the outstanding\r\n\r\ncommercial  issues, to enable the project to go forward  with  a\r\n\r\nclean slate and the best chance of success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h) Both sides will jointly assist CSSD to enhance its\r\n\r\nfinancial performance and to enable CSSD's early listing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures will put the SIP project on a workable track\r\n\r\nand  improve  the  joint venture company's financial  viability.\r\n\r\nThe  Chinese side have assured us that they will do their utmost\r\n\r\nover the next 18 months to implement the agreements and make the\r\n\r\n8 sq km area a success.  The Singapore side remains committed to\r\n\r\nthe  project  and  will  do all it can  to  achieve  a  positive\r\n\r\noutcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shareholders in the Singapore consortium have fully\r\n\r\nendorsed  the MOU.  They include American, Japanese,  Dutch  and\r\n\r\nKorean  corporations. The consortium has slightly increased  its\r\n\r\ninvestments  in the joint venture companies since  January  last\r\n\r\nyear.   I have circulated an updated list of investments  (Cols.\r\n\r\n1867-1870)  by  consortium members and  other  Government-linked\r\n\r\ncompanies in the SIP project.  Members should have it  on  their\r\n\r\nseats.   The total amount invested by statutory boards and  GLCs\r\n\r\nin  the project so far is US$147 million.  In addition, as  part\r\n\r\nof  the package deal in the MOU, Temasek has agreed to guarantee\r\n\r\na loan of up to US$65 million to the project, for a fixed period\r\n\r\nup  to  31st December 2003, in return for a commercial fee  from\r\n\r\nthe   members   of  the  Singapore  consortium.

But  shareholders   in   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nconsortium   decided  to  invest  in  CSSD  based  strictly   on\r\n\r\ncommercial considerations.

There could not be any  certainty  of\r\n\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a combination of reasons, it has proved more difficult\r\n\r\nfor  SIP  to  become  profitable than the  Singapore  consortium\r\n\r\ninitially expected.  However, with the package of solutions  now\r\n\r\nagreed  upon  by both parties, and the assurances given  by  the\r\n\r\nChinese,  the SIP project has a reasonable opportunity  to  turn\r\n\r\naround  and  become profitable in the medium term, provided  the\r\n\r\nexternal investment climate does not deteriorate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

But there was\r\n\r\na reason. We were aware of it but there was a reason why we\r\n\r\nstarted on a different area, and that is because we were not\r\n\r\njust building an industrial estate, but building a township\r\n\r\ncomplete with schools, houses, infrastructure, industrial park,\r\n\r\nutilities, everything.  Therefore the idea was to look for a\r\n\r\nfresh piece of ground and start in order to have a clean slate.\r\n\r\nWe believed that the Suzhou authorities would give clear\r\n\r\npriority to the SIP project over SND and indeed this was so for\r\n\r\nthe first few years of the project.  But as time went on, the\r\n\r\ncompetition and rivalry became a problem and finally came to a\r\n\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members know, I think in November 1997, one of the Vice\r\n\r\nMayors of Suzhou went to Germany to promote SND, the rival,  and\r\n\r\ntold  the German investors that they should come to SND  because\r\n\r\nJiang  Zemin did not support SIP, to the amazement of Chancellor\r\n\r\nHelmut  Kohl's  special representative, who  was  in  charge  of\r\n\r\nencouraging  German  businessmen to go to  China  together  with\r\n\r\nSingapore.   And that is  what brought the matter to a head.  We\r\n\r\nhave  been  discussing it over these last 20 months and  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen finally settled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should quote to the Member what one very senior Chinese\r\n\r\nofficial told us.  He said that if he had been aware of SND,  he\r\n\r\nwould not have advised us to go to Suzhou.

From my not very up-to-date knowledge, I believe  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  also  having some difficulties, not  because  of  the\r\n\r\nChinese  partners but because investments into  China  generally\r\n\r\nare  down  this year and therefore they are finding it difficult\r\n\r\nto get tenants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But certainly, from the lessons from SIP, we would have to\r\n\r\ndo  a  full post mortem and derive the full benefits from  them.\r\n\r\nAnd  it is not just us who will do the post mortem but I am sure\r\n\r\nHarvard Business School will take a very close interest  and  so\r\n\r\nwill the Europeans, Insead, and the others.

At the same time, we have gone round\r\n\r\nand explained to the tenants and reassured them what the\r\n\r\nagreement consists of and what the arrangements are which we are\r\n\r\nmaking over the next two years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a transition period of two years to the 1st of\r\n\r\nJanuary  2001 before the shareholding structure changes  and  by\r\n\r\nthat time, Suzhou Industrial Park will be nearly seven years  in\r\n\r\nexistence.

Executives,  regardless  of  seniority,  are  not\r\n\r\ncovered by the Employment Act.  It is assumed and our law  takes\r\n\r\nthe  position that executives should be able to look after their\r\n\r\nown   interests,  as  they  are  usually  better  educated,  and\r\n\r\nprofessionals  who can negotiate their terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment.   They  can  negotiate  and  enter  into  employment\r\n\r\ncontracts  by themselves, and do not need to rely on  collective\r\n\r\nbargaining by unions on their behalf.  To include them under the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act will create unnecessary rigidity and hinder  the\r\n\r\nfree operation of the labour market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nevertheless, executives who need help to resolve\r\n\r\nemployment disputes with their employers can seek the assistance\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Ministry  of  Manpower, which  provides  conciliation\r\n\r\nservice.  If their disputes cannot be resolved amicably  through\r\n\r\nconciliation, they need to file a suit under the common  law  to\r\n\r\nseek remedy, because employers are not legally obliged to accept\r\n\r\nthe Ministry's advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more employees becoming executives, and more jobs\r\n\r\nbeing  classified  as  executive jobs, the assumption  that  all\r\n\r\nexecutives are sufficiently well-informed and experienced not to\r\n\r\nneed any protection from the Employment Act may be questionable.\r\n\r\nIndeed,   during  the  past  two  years,  for  example,  several\r\n\r\nexecutives  have sought the help of my Ministry, the unions  and\r\n\r\nMPs  at  their meet-the-people sessions.  We may need to  extend\r\n\r\npart  of  the  provisions in the Employment Act  to  executives.\r\n\r\nHowever, we should do so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly to the extent necessary.  The Government will\r\n\r\nstudy this carefully.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, current labour laws do not prevent executives from\r\n\r\nforming or being represented by their unions.  However, they may\r\n\r\nnot be represented by trade unions whose membership consists  of\r\n\r\nrank-and-file  employees.  Over the years, NTUC has  argued  for\r\n\r\nboth  executives and rank-and-file employees to  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\njoin  the  same  union  as it is better  for  team-work.   Thus,\r\n\r\nfrontline supervisors who were promoted from the ranks have been\r\n\r\nallowed  to  join  rank-and-file  unions  under  the  Tripartite\r\n\r\nGuidelines   on   Eligibility  to  Join  Rank-and-File   Unions,\r\n\r\nintroduced in 1992.  In addition, some employers have, on  their\r\n\r\nown  accord,  allowed  their executives  to  join  rank-and-file\r\n\r\nunions, but this is a voluntary arrangement.   Junior and middle\r\n\r\nlevel executives can join rank-and-file unions as general branch\r\n\r\nmembers,  but  only  to  enjoy the social  benefits  the  unions\r\n\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade unions have played a crucial role in maintaining\r\n\r\nindustrial  harmony,  and cooperating  with  employers  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to promote economic development and workers' welfare.\r\n\r\nThe  growing  proportion of new entrants to  the  labour  market\r\n\r\njoining  executive  ranks, rather than the  rank-and-file  posts\r\n\r\ntraditionally  represented by trade unions,  means  a  potential\r\n\r\nshrinkage  of the unions' support base.  This would  have  major\r\n\r\nimplications for the NTUC and for the strength of our tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should review the Industrial Relations Act, especially\r\n\r\nsection  16(3), to see how it can be amended to  suit  the  very\r\n\r\ndifferent  circumstances that prevail today. We should  consider\r\n\r\nallowing the same union to represent both rank-and-file  workers\r\n\r\nand  junior  and middle level executives, instead of having  the\r\n\r\ntwo  groups  in  separate  unions.  We may, as  the  Member  has\r\n\r\nsuggested,  allow rank-and-file unions to represent  junior  and\r\n\r\nmiddle  level  executives in some employment  matters,  such  as\r\n\r\nretrenchment,   dismissal  and  grievances,  although   not   in\r\n\r\ncollective bargaining.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tEmployers' organisations have expressed to my\r\n\r\nMinistry their concerns over the possible difficulties that such\r\n\r\na change may cause.  They are concerned with the potential for a\r\n\r\n\"conflict of interest\" when executives become members of rank-and-file unions.  Employers are also concerned with the impact\r\n\r\non management's control, disciplinary and grievance procedures\r\n\r\nand lawful termination of contracts of employment of executives.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the Industrial Relations Act, we will take into\r\n\r\naccount not only the desirability of widening the membership\r\n\r\nbase for trade unions, but also employers' legitimate concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has called for a tripartite meeting with\r\n\r\nthe  NTUC  and  SNEF to discuss this issue.

Part  of  the\r\n\r\nreason  is that they operate in many countries and it may weaken\r\n\r\ntheir  position.  That is why they refuse to set  up  unions  in\r\n\r\nsome  of these countries.

Please ask your\r\n\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, can the Minister comment on some of\r\n\r\nthese concerns that employers have, especially the MNCs?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, employers have many\r\n\r\nconcerns over unionisation of their executives.  We have to bear\r\n\r\nin  mind that employers, especially the MNCs, operate throughout\r\n\r\nthe  world,  and  they may have very different  experience  with\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  elsewhere.   In some countries,  they  have  very\r\n\r\nunpleasant  and unhappy experience with trade unions,  and  this\r\n\r\nhas in some way affected their mindset.  So, some MNCs operating\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  see efforts to represent their  executives  as  a\r\n\r\nfailure on the part of management to look after the needs of the\r\n\r\nexecutives in their employ.  Very often, when the union seeks to\r\n\r\nrepresent  even their rank-and-file employees, the  head  office\r\n\r\nwill  question  the local management by saying, \"Have  you  done\r\n\r\nsomething wrong to cause the workers to be unhappy?\"  These  are\r\n\r\nsome  of  the  examples  that have  been  given  to  us  in  our\r\n\r\ndiscussions with employers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are also concerned that unionisation of their\r\n\r\nexecutives would give rise to rigidities, because it is  natural\r\n\r\nfor  unions, once they start to organise the executives, to want\r\n\r\nto  seek standardisation of rewards and benefits.  And many MNCs\r\n\r\noperating  in  Singapore, like MNCs elsewhere,  take  a  totally\r\n\r\ndifferent  approach  in  the  remuneration  package  for   their\r\n\r\nexecutives.   There  are  a lot more individual  components  and\r\n\r\nthere are different reward schemes for executives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other employers have given us feedback that they are\r\n\r\nconcerned with union representation of their executives  because\r\n\r\nthey fear that it would give rise to more workplace disputes and\r\n\r\ncould  also  affect  labour-management relations  at  management\r\n\r\nlevel.   As  I  said, a number of such feedback arose  from  the\r\n\r\nemployers or the MNCs' prior experience or contacts with unions,\r\n\r\nsometimes  in their home countries and sometimes from  operating\r\n\r\nin other countries.  Let me hasten to add that I do not entirely\r\n\r\nagree with all the feedback and their responses.  I think the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade union movement in Singapore is very different\r\n\r\nfrom the trade union movement in many other countries.  The\r\n\r\ntrade unions in Singapore take a non-adversarial and non-confrontational approach.  In fact, they have played a key role\r\n\r\nin helping employers to survive the recent economic downturn\r\n\r\nthat we have just experienced.  So we need to persuade such\r\n\r\nemployers to change their mindset and attitude.  But we must\r\n\r\nalso bear in mind that where they have genuine concerns, we\r\n\r\nshould be prepared to address these concerns and not force our\r\n\r\nway upon them.

Permit me to address his supplementary\r\n\r\nquestion, although it does seem to be a little far from the main\r\n\r\nQuestion that was answered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have to take a bit of time, with your indulgence,\r\n\r\nSir.  The lecturer, who was the subject of this court case,  was\r\n\r\ndismissed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\non  6th May 1997, less than four weeks  before  his\r\n\r\ncontract  was  due  to expire on 31st May  1997.   The  contract\r\n\r\nprovided  for a gross monthly salary of $3,700 and  a  bonus  or\r\n\r\ngratuity equivalent to at least one month's last drawn salary at\r\n\r\nthe  end of the contract.  The school said that the lecturer was\r\n\r\ndismissed  because  of  his  poor  performance.   The   lecturer\r\n\r\nappealed  to  me  alleging  that his dismissal  was  unjust  and\r\n\r\nwithout  valid  ground,  and here  is  the  answer  to  Mr  J.B.\r\n\r\nJeyaretnam  too.   In fact, the avenue for  such  an  appeal  is\r\n\r\nprovided  for  under  the  Employment  Act.   Pursuant  to   the\r\n\r\nEmployment Act, I therefore asked the Commissioner for Labour to\r\n\r\nconduct  an  inquiry  into  the  circumstances  leading  to  his\r\n\r\ndismissal.   This  was done by an officer  of  the  Ministry  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the inquiry, the employer had refused to\r\n\r\ncooperate.   They  maintained  that  the  Commissioner  had   no\r\n\r\njurisdiction to deal with the case as the lecturer's  employment\r\n\r\ncontract with the school contained a clause for arbitration over\r\n\r\nany  dispute  relating to his employment,  and  that  since  the\r\n\r\nlecturer  earned more than $1,600, the Employment  Act  did  not\r\n\r\napply.   Sir,  this  is  incorrect.  The  lecturer  was  clearly\r\n\r\ncovered by the Employment Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school participated in the inquiry only after much\r\n\r\npersuasion,  even  then,  very reluctantly.   The  investigating\r\n\r\nofficer  extended four invitations to the school to present  its\r\n\r\ncase to the Ministry.  The school only responded once by sending\r\n\r\nits  executive director on one occasion.  The executive director\r\n\r\ngave  a  statement  to the investigating officer  and  left  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  hurriedly,  claiming that she had  to  attend  another\r\n\r\nappointment   elsewhere.   The  school  was  given   more   than\r\n\r\nsufficient  opportunities to state its  case  but,  for  reasons\r\n\r\nknown only to the school, it chose to avoid participating in the\r\n\r\ninquiry.   Sir,  in  one of the letters to the  school,  it  was\r\n\r\nstated  very clearly that the Ministry would proceed to evaluate\r\n\r\nthe   case   based   on   whatever  facts   gathered   so   far,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding that the school's interests might  prejudicially\r\n\r\nbe affected by the Minister's decision.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the facts and evidence he was able to\r\n\r\ngather, the investigating officer reported that the dismissal\r\n\r\nwas wrongful and recommended that the lecturer should be\r\n\r\ncompensated.  The officer's report noted that the school did not\r\n\r\nconduct any investigation or inquiry to establish that the\r\n\r\nlecturer performed poorly as a lecturer.  In short, he had no\r\n\r\nopportunity to defend himself.  The complaints of the school\r\n\r\nagainst the lecturer had, in fact, occurred early in his\r\n\r\nemployment.  The lecturer had explained, and the school appeared\r\n\r\nto have accepted his explanation and did not pursue the matter.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, surprising that just before his term of\r\n\r\nemployment was to end, he was suddenly sacked.  After\r\n\r\nconsidering the report, I concluded that the school had sacked\r\n\r\nthe lecturer without just cause or excuse.  The school was\r\n\r\naccordingly ordered by me to pay a sum of $6,800 to the\r\n\r\nlecturer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school challenged the order in the High Court.\r\n\r\nInitially,  it  argued that the Ministry had no jurisdiction  to\r\n\r\nconduct  the  inquiry.  Later, it shifted  its  stand  and  kept\r\n\r\nchanging its grounds for challenging the order.  They failed  on\r\n\r\nalmost  all the new grounds they raised.  But the Court accepted\r\n\r\ntheir  arguments  that the Ministry's inquiry failed  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith the rules of natural justice.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> I do not know whether\r\n\r\nthis  matter has gone on appeal.

The court accepted their\r\n\r\nargument  that the Ministry's inquiry failed to comply with  the\r\n\r\nrule  of  natural  justice  as  the  school  was  not  given  an\r\n\r\nopportunity to be heard.  On this basis, the court gave judgment\r\n\r\nin  favour  of the school.  The Ministry did give evidence  that\r\n\r\nthe  school was given every opportunity to be heard.  The school\r\n\r\npresented evidence to the opposite effect.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the court also criticised the Ministry for\r\n\r\nlack  of  procedures  in  dealing  with  complaints  under   the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act.   Sir,  I  would  like  to  assure  the  House,\r\n\r\nemployers, unions and workers that under the existing procedures\r\n\r\nto  inquire into a dismissal, adequate steps are taken to ensure\r\n\r\nthat all parties involved are given sufficient opportunities  to\r\n\r\npresent  their case and to respond to arguments put  forward  by\r\n\r\none  party  against the other.  This process is evident  in  the\r\n\r\ncase  in question.  The school was invited repeatedly to provide\r\n\r\nits  side  of  the story.  The school was given a  copy  of  the\r\n\r\nlecturer's  complaint letter to the Ministry and was invited  to\r\n\r\nattend  the investigation on four occasions.  It was the  school\r\n\r\nwhich chose not to attend the inquiry proceedings, except on one\r\n\r\noccasion, and even so, reluctantly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will not be appealing the court's ruling. We\r\n\r\nwere  advised  by  the Attorney-General not  to  appeal  as  the\r\n\r\njudge's decision was based on his findings of fact. Appeals must\r\n\r\nbe  on points of law and not findings of fact unless the factual\r\n\r\nfindings are manifestly against the weight of evidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The court had focused on the inquiry procedure adopted in\r\n\r\ndealing  with the dismissal appeal.  My Ministry has,  in  fact,\r\n\r\ncommenced  such  a  review  to refine and  tighten  the  inquiry\r\n\r\nprocedure  in  view of the court's ruling and observations.   We\r\n\r\nwill  spare no effort to rectify any shortcomings.  We will also\r\n\r\ntake  steps to minimise the opportunities for persons to present\r\n\r\nto  a third party a distorted picture of what we did or did  not\r\n\r\ndo, when carrying out our statutory responsibilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, however, like to assure the House that the\r\n\r\nexisting  dispute settlement system administered by my  Ministry\r\n\r\nis  effective  and  efficient  in  resolving  conflicts  between\r\n\r\nemployers  and workers in an amicable manner.  We  have  enjoyed\r\n\r\nthree  decades  of  industrial harmony with no major  industrial\r\n\r\nconflict.  The existing dispute settlement system has served  us\r\n\r\nwell for 30 years.  In 1998, my Ministry had\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelped to settle the employment claims and disputes\r\n\r\ninvolving some 12,000 non-unionised workers and amicably\r\n\r\nresolved 291 cases of industrial disputes brought up by trade\r\n\r\nunions and employers.  For the first half of this year, claims\r\n\r\nby about 6,200 non-unionised workers and 120 unionised dispute\r\n\r\ncases were handled by the Ministry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry fully subscribes to the rules of natural\r\n\r\njustice.   Indeed,  as  an  arbiter of employment  disputes,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  has  a duty and responsibility to evaluate  each  case\r\n\r\nthoroughly  and  objectively, and to uphold  the  principles  of\r\n\r\nimpartiality  and fairness in dealing with employment  disputes.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to assure the House that our employment  dispute\r\n\r\nsettlement  mechanism is sound, as judged  by  the  overwhelming\r\n\r\nnumber of resolved case.  Notwithstanding that, my Ministry will\r\n\r\nnot spare any effort to improve on the existing system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CONSTRUCTION SECTOR</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Measures to reduce accidents)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower\r\n\r\nwhat  further  safety  measures are being considered  to  reduce\r\n\r\naccidents  in the construction sector, in view of the  increased\r\n\r\nnumber of accidents recently.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first half of\r\n\r\nthis  year  (January to June 1999), a total of 753 accidents  in\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites were reported to my Ministry.   This  is  an\r\n\r\nincrease  of  19 cases or 2.6% when compared to the same  period\r\n\r\nlast  year.   In  terms  of  fatalities,  28  workers  died   in\r\n\r\nconstruction worksite accidents for the first half of this year.\r\n\r\nThis  is  11  (or 28%) less than the 39 workers who  lost  their\r\n\r\nlives  over the same period last year.  Although the  number  of\r\n\r\nfatalities  has been reduced, the number of fatal  accidents  is\r\n\r\nstill high and should be further  reduced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years, the Ministry has taken a number of\r\n\r\nmeasures   to   help  improve  the  safety  situation   in   the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  Some of the more  significant  measures\r\n\r\ninclude Safety\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourses for Project Managers, the requirement for\r\n\r\nSafety Provisions in Contract Documents and the stepping up of\r\n\r\nenforcement action.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, officers from the Department of Industrial\r\n\r\nSafety conducted a total of 179 special enforcement exercises on\r\n\r\nconstruction   worksites  in  addition  to  the  4,581   routine\r\n\r\ninspections.  The inspections led to 344 contractors being fined\r\n\r\nfrom $500 to $42,000 each and 54 occupiers were issued with Stop\r\n\r\nWork Orders for grossly unsafe work sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry is aware that safety issues confronting\r\n\r\ncontractors  must be addressed by the whole of the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.   Hence,  there is a need to  adopt  a  total  systems\r\n\r\napproach  involving contractors, construction professionals  and\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to improve the safety situation in the  construction\r\n\r\nindustry.  The Construction 21 (C21) study which my Ministry and\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of National Development have undertaken  with  key\r\n\r\npartners  of  the construction industry will recommend  measures\r\n\r\naimed  at  addressing both the upstream and downstream processes\r\n\r\nto achieve higher safety at construction sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the C21 study, my Ministry feels that more\r\n\r\nmust  be  done  by the contractors as employers to  improve  the\r\n\r\nsituation.   Investigations  into  accidents  that  occurred  at\r\n\r\nworksites revealed that most of these accidents could have  been\r\n\r\nprevented if only the contractors had provided the basic  safety\r\n\r\nmeasures, such as barricading open sides, covering all  openings\r\n\r\nto  prevent workers from falling as well as objects from falling\r\n\r\ninto  these  open  areas  and  also improving  on  housekeeping.\r\n\r\nContractors must know that they have the ultimate responsibility\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that there is a safe work place  for their  workers.\r\n\r\nAs  a  further  deterrent, my Ministry is now considering  three\r\n\r\nadditional  measures.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Deterrent sentence for contractors</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Factories Act, a person who contravenes any\r\n\r\nprovision  of  the Act that could lead to bodily injury  of  any\r\n\r\nperson will face a maximum penalty of $10,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor a jail term of six months, or both.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nwill not hesitate to press for deterrent sentence (including\r\n\r\njail sentence) for individuals who are found to have blatantly\r\n\r\ndisregarded safety rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Compulsory safety re-training of all worksite personnel</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a worksite is issued with a Stop Work Order, the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will make it a condition to have all the personnel  of\r\n\r\nthe  worksite  undergo  appropriate safety  refresher  training,\r\n\r\nbefore  allowing  work at the worksite to resume.   This  is  to\r\n\r\nimpress on the managers, supervisors and workers that unless the\r\n\r\nworksite is managed safely, work cannot resume.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Bar contractors from further employing Work Permit holders</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, contractors who employ foreign workers are obliged\r\n\r\nto provide a safe and healthy work environment.  If a contractor\r\n\r\nhas a bad safety record, it is an indication that the contractor\r\n\r\nis  not  able to meet this obligation.  Such contractors  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  allowed  to  engage more foreign  workers.   Hence,  my\r\n\r\nMinistry  will consider barring the contractor from   employment\r\n\r\nof  more  work permit holders, i.e. no new work permits will  be\r\n\r\nissued  and   renewal  of  existing work  permits  will  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take such firm action in order to further bring\r\n\r\ndown the accident rate in the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

He himself\r\n\r\nhad been diagnosed with low-grade\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlymphoma in November 1992.  To have one person in\r\n\r\nthe family stricken with cancer was bad enough.  To have both\r\n\r\nhusband and wife suffering from it was indeed a cruel blow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But President Ong and his wife took the news calmly and\r\n\r\nstoically.  As President Ong told me several times, life must go\r\n\r\non.   Both  he and his wife decided to live as normal  lives  as\r\n\r\nthey could.  They shut out their ailments from their minds,  and\r\n\r\nimmersed themselves in their work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prognosis for Mrs Ong's cancer was poor. But she\r\n\r\nfought on, with the support of her husband and family.  She  was\r\n\r\none  courageous lady.  Over the past two and a half  years,  she\r\n\r\nwent  in and out of hospitals, both in Singapore and the  United\r\n\r\nStates.   She  underwent  repeated major surgery,  and  received\r\n\r\nchemotherapy  and radiation treatment.  But she took  everything\r\n\r\nin  her stride, and kept to her normal heavy schedule of her own\r\n\r\narchitect's  work and her duties as the First  Lady.   When  her\r\n\r\nfriends fell ill, she would visit and comfort them.  She kept to\r\n\r\nherself  her  own  condition, and the pain she suffered  as  the\r\n\r\ndisease progressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was brave until the end. Her last public\r\n\r\nengagement  was the President's Charity Ball on  9th  July.   My\r\n\r\nwife  and  I  called  on her and the President  in  hospital  on\r\n\r\nSunday,  18th July.  We knew that her illness was  in  its  last\r\n\r\nstages.   She  was in obvious discomfort.  Yet she  received  us\r\n\r\nwith her ready smile, and chatted in good spirit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong chaired the boards of Nanyang Girls' High and\r\n\r\nNanyang  Primary  School.  When we talked about  Nanyang  Girls'\r\n\r\nHigh  School,  her  eyes  lit up immediately.   The  new  school\r\n\r\nbuildings  at Linden Drive had just been completed.   She  spoke\r\n\r\nwith  pride  about  the  new campus, and was  delighted  when  I\r\n\r\ncommented on its beautiful facade and distinctive features.   We\r\n\r\nhad such a lively conversation that for a moment, we forgot that\r\n\r\nshe  was  not well.  She even talked about her next project,  to\r\n\r\nredevelop the Nanyang Primary School.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was the architect for the new campus of\r\n\r\nNanyang Girls' High School, as well as several other projects\r\n\r\nfor the school.  I was glad to read in the Zaobao that Mrs Ong\r\n\r\nhad donated her architectural fees from these projects to the\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Ong was also deeply involved in charitable work. She\r\n\r\nsupported many fund raising projects for various charities  each\r\n\r\nyear.   She  was  also  patron of several civic  and  charitable\r\n\r\norganisations,  including  the  Children's  Charities  and  Girl\r\n\r\nGuides Association.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of us knew Mrs Ong Teng Cheong long before she became\r\n\r\nthe  First Lady.  She was an unfailingly gracious hostess and  a\r\n\r\nfriend.   My  wife and I, and many of us here, have enjoyed  her\r\n\r\nhospitality at her home.  We will all miss her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, President Ong Teng Cheong was a member of\r\n\r\nthis  House  from 1972 till 1993 when he resigned to  stand  for\r\n\r\nelection  as President.  We all know him well.  He  has  lost  a\r\n\r\ndear  wife.  Our hearts go to him and his family in their moment\r\n\r\nof  grief.  We offer them our sincere condolences.  Even  though\r\n\r\nthe  untimely  passing of Mrs Ong has left a big  void  for  the\r\n\r\nfamily,  we  hope that they will draw some comfort and  strength\r\n\r\nfrom our sympathy and support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the people, the Government and this House, I\r\n\r\nextend our heartfelt condolences to the President and his family\r\n\r\non their bereavement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the House observe a two-minute silence as a\r\n\r\nmark  of  our respect for the late First Lady after others  have\r\n\r\nspoken and the motion is passed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I propose to adjourn the sitting at\r\n\r\napproximately  2.30  pm  to allow hon.

And in doing so, I speak on behalf of the NTUC,  all\r\n\r\nunion members and workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many unionists got to know Mrs Ong when Mr Ong Teng Cheong\r\n\r\nwas  the  Secretary-General of the  NTUC.   Our  unionists  were\r\n\r\nencouraged by the quiet support she gave to the labour  movement\r\n\r\nand  were  touched  by  her  warmth and  hospitality.   It  came\r\n\r\nnaturally  to  her as she herself had a difficult  life  in  her\r\n\r\nyounger  days.  The empathy she felt for the lower  income  came\r\n\r\nnaturally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She provided a good role model for all workers. Everyone\r\n\r\nknows  she was hardworking and diligent, and strove to excel  in\r\n\r\nher  work.   She had also been a good role model for all  female\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  -  a good mother, a good housekeeper, a successful\r\n\r\ncareer woman who still found time to support her husband in  his\r\n\r\npublic  service.  We also know that she had a soft spot for  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantaged through the support she gave to many charities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all share the family's loss.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock)</b>\r\n\r\n<b></b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing\r\n\r\nin the name of the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I have known the President and Mrs Ong for more\r\n\r\nthan  20  years.  We feel that Mrs Ong was a strong, courageous,\r\n\r\ngracious,  optimistic,  frank  and  sincere  lady.   She  was  a\r\n\r\ncompassionate person (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). She would go all out\r\n\r\nand  put  in her wholehearted efforts to do whatever she thought\r\n\r\nshe  ought  to  do  for  the nation  and  society,  without  any\r\n\r\nconsideration  for her personal gains or losses.   Whenever  she\r\n\r\nhad  any  view  and  feeling on  any  issue,  except  for  major\r\n\r\nnational  issues, she would unreservedly express her opinion  on\r\n\r\nthe matter in a straight-forward manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with her illness, she steadfastly discharged her\r\n\r\nduties as the First Lady without any hesitation.  The First Lady\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nherself was enthusiastically involved in charity and\r\n\r\nattached great importance to educational and cultural work.  She\r\n\r\ntook the initiative and actively participated in many cultural,\r\n\r\neducational and charitable activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With more than two decades of association with her, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  have  many  fond memories  of  her.   Many  of  our\r\n\r\nconversations  with her are deeply embedded  in  our  minds.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to mention just two recent events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first event was two years ago, at an informal lunch\r\n\r\nwith  President  Ong, my wife asked Mrs Ong about  her  illness.\r\n\r\nShe  just  briefly mentioned about the condition of her  health,\r\n\r\nand then pinched my wife's hand and said in one simple sentence,\r\n\r\n\"Just like this\" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) to end this part of the\r\n\r\nconversation.  However, when touched on the subject  of  raising\r\n\r\nfunds  for  the  construction of the new  premises  for  Nanyang\r\n\r\nGirls'  High  School, she was full of zeal and  enthusiasm.   My\r\n\r\nwife  and  I  once  again appreciated the very  style  in  which\r\n\r\nPresident Ong and Mrs Ong conducted themselves in life, and that\r\n\r\nis, to suffer in silence their own pain but to devote themselves\r\n\r\nenthusiastically to the cause of public interest.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second event was in July last year when I went with the\r\n\r\ndelegation  to accompany President Ong and Mrs Ong to Liverpool.\r\n\r\nAt  the  convocation ceremony of the Liverpool University,  when\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong  was conferred the honorary doctorate  degree,  I\r\n\r\nnoticed  that  Mrs  Ong  appeared to be  full  of  thoughts  and\r\n\r\nfeelings.   Subsequently,   she shared with me some memories  of\r\n\r\nthe  days  she spent looking after her husband and  children  in\r\n\r\nLiverpool.   From  the conversation, I felt her  deep  love  and\r\n\r\ndevotion to President Ong and the children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The First Lady has departed. She has lived through a full\r\n\r\nlife  with little or no regret.  For the nation, for the family,\r\n\r\nfor  society, she has made many great contributions.   Her  love\r\n\r\nremains with us.  I believe if, at all, she has any anxiety, it\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwould be  the impact of her departure on her\r\n\r\nhusband, President Ong, because over the past three decades, she\r\n\r\nhad been a pillar of great strength supporting President Ong.  I\r\n\r\nwould urge President Ong to restrain his grief and take care of\r\n\r\nhis health (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). With the support of his\r\n\r\nfriends  from various  quarters, I hope that President Ong would  be  \r\n\r\nable  to overcome the impact of this bereavement.  I also hope that \r\n\r\nafter the  death of their beloved mother, Tze Guan and Tze Boon  \r\n\r\nwould be  even more resolute in the development of their careers,  \r\n\r\nand spend  more time with their father so as to console the soul  of\r\n\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nsupport the motion moved by our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like him, I share the President's grief for the loss of his\r\n\r\nwife.  The President told me a moving tale of his wife when  she\r\n\r\nattended the Charity Ball function.  He said she sat through the\r\n\r\nnight  function with no signs of any problem.   It  was  a  long\r\n\r\nnight  and she patiently and courageously went about her  duties\r\n\r\nas  the  First  Lady.  But beneath the strong composure,  was  a\r\n\r\nwoman  in  severe and excruciating pain.  It was only  when  she\r\n\r\nreached  home  that she collapsed in pain.   She  must  be  very\r\n\r\nstrong to have gone through this and I am sure she must have put\r\n\r\nup  such  a strong front in the course of her duty as the  First\r\n\r\nLady.   She had always stood by the President.  She carried  her\r\n\r\nduty as the First Lady with the courage very few can match.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, my condolence to our President and his\r\n\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, the First Lady, Madam Ling Siew May, passed  away\r\n\r\non  30th July 1999.  The business community felt a great loss in\r\n\r\nthe  passing away of the First Lady.  On behalf of the  business\r\n\r\ncommunity,  I  would  like to convey our  deepest  sympathy  and\r\n\r\ncondolence to President Ong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read the life story of Mrs Ong, I was greatly\r\n\r\ntouched.  Mrs Ong was an\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexemplary model of an Asian woman cultivated under\r\n\r\ntraditional Asian culture and values.  Her contribution to\r\n\r\nfamily, business, society and the nation was the pride of\r\n\r\nwomenfolk in Singapore, and the pride of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore.  Allow me to raise the following five points to\r\n\r\nillustrate the greatness of the First Lady:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, she was very hardworking and dedicated. She went\r\n\r\nthrough severe hardship in her younger days.  After spending  an\r\n\r\nunhappy  childhood  in  an orphanage, she travelled  across  the\r\n\r\nocean  to Singapore at the tender age of 11 to study.   All  the\r\n\r\nproblems  in  coping with a very different language  and  living\r\n\r\nenvironment did not overwhelm her.  Instead, it inspired her  to\r\n\r\ncultivate  in  herself  a  fighting spirit.   She  overcame  the\r\n\r\ndifficulties  in learning English and the other   subjects,  and\r\n\r\nsuccessfully  completed her secondary and high  school  studies.\r\n\r\nEventually  she went overseas to study in Australia  and  became\r\n\r\nthe   first   Asian  girl  to  graduate  from  the  Faculty   of\r\n\r\nArchitecture in the University.  At a time when the society  was\r\n\r\nstill  very  conservative, as a female  and  a  Chinese-educated\r\n\r\nstudent, she overcame many difficulties and went on courageously\r\n\r\nto  achieve academic success.  This spirit of enduring  hardship\r\n\r\nand self-reliance is worthy of our emulation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, she was a good wife and a good mother, diligent\r\n\r\nand  thrifty.   In the family, she was a good wife  and  a  good\r\n\r\nmother, devoting herself body and soul to look after her husband\r\n\r\nand  her  children  and creating a warm  home  for  them.   This\r\n\r\nenabled the President to concentrate on his work without  having\r\n\r\nto  worry  about  things at home.  The two  sons  could   devote\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  their  studies  to  become  useful  citizens  of\r\n\r\nsociety.  The First Lady must be given due credit for the  great\r\n\r\nsuccess  achieved  by  the President and  the  two  sons  today.\r\n\r\nDuring   President  Ong's  term  of  office  as   Minister   and\r\n\r\nsubsequently as the President, Mrs Ong was always at  his  side,\r\n\r\nsilently  giving him all the support.   Her cordial  smile,  her\r\n\r\ngracious  and elegant demeanour, her simple outfit  gave  people\r\n\r\nthe feeling of being very approachable and respectable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, she was devoted to her duty and enthusiastic in\r\n\r\nher work.  The First Lady was the most reliable partner of her\r\n\r\nhusband's career. When her husband was holding the ministerial\r\n\r\nposition, she took over the bulk of workload in their\r\n\r\narchitectural firm.  After her husband was elevated to the high\r\n\r\noffice of Presidency, her official duties became even more busy\r\n\r\nand heavy.  Yet, she did not drop her responsibility in the\r\n\r\narchitectural work.  She divided her time and energy on both her\r\n\r\npublic and private career, attending to each and every aspect of\r\n\r\nlife with great success.  Her spirit of love for work and\r\n\r\ndevotion to duties is something that is worthy of our admiration\r\n\r\nand praise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, her passion for her alma mater and society. The\r\n\r\nFirst  Lady's love for her alma mater is well known to everyone.\r\n\r\nShe  had  made the reconstruction of Nanyang Girls' High  School\r\n\r\nher  lifelong  aspiration.  Besides her  passion  for  her  alma\r\n\r\nmater,   she was also deeply concerned with education,  charity,\r\n\r\nwelfare  of women and children, as well as the latest  situation\r\n\r\nand  development  of culture and the arts in  Singapore,  giving\r\n\r\nthem  her wholehearted support. The female nature of love, kind-heartedness,  patience  and concern for  others  was  manifestly\r\n\r\nrevealed in the person of the First Lady.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, her courage and unyielding fight against her\r\n\r\nillness.   Two and a half years ago, she was diagnosed  to  have\r\n\r\nsuffered  from cancer, but she exercised tremendous perseverance\r\n\r\nto  battle  against her illness. She showed  no  sign  of  being\r\n\r\ndispirited or depressed.  She carried on discharging her  duties\r\n\r\nas  the  First  Lady, greeting the people with her usual  smile,\r\n\r\nreceiving  foreign dignitaries, and even went on overseas  trips\r\n\r\nwith the President.   From her smile, we could see a strong  and\r\n\r\ncourageous  woman  who  loved life and  work  and  was  full  of\r\n\r\nfighting spirit, battling against her illness.  She had not been\r\n\r\noverwhelmed  by  her disease but continued to  live,  and  lived\r\n\r\nbravely.   These  noble  qualities had  shaped  a  superlatively\r\n\r\nunique image of the First Lady.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the First Lady devoted her whole life to\r\n\r\nher family,  society and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe nation.  She worked steadfastly and silently all\r\n\r\nthe way  until the end of her life.   She was the epitome of the\r\n\r\nvirtues of Asian women.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical body is finite, but the spirit lives on\r\n\r\neternally.   The love that the First Lady has left  behind  will\r\n\r\nstay  forever.   Her  smile, demeanour, integrity,  noble  moral\r\n\r\ncharacter  and  poise will always remain in  the  minds  of  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the business community, I\r\n\r\nfully  support  the  motion standing in the name  of  the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs  (Mr  Zainul Abidin Rasheed)  (In  Malay):   Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I did not know the First Lady, Mrs Ong, well,  but\r\n\r\nwell enough to say that Mrs Ong was a mother, a professional, an\r\n\r\nentrepreneur  and a First Lady who was determined, strong-willed\r\n\r\nand  full  of benevolence.  When I was Editor of Berita  Harian,\r\n\r\nand  covering the former Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew's visit\r\n\r\nto  China  in  1980,  President Ong and  Mrs  Ong  were  in  the\r\n\r\ndelegation.   I  saw  Mrs Ong then as someone  who  was  gentle,\r\n\r\ngracious and caring.  Mrs Ong was very concerned about our needs\r\n\r\nand  welfare, especially for the reporters who were covering the\r\n\r\nvisit.   Singapore  has  lost  a First  Lady  who  was  full  of\r\n\r\ndedication  and one with the true spirit of being a Singaporean.\r\n\r\nMay her soul rest in peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion moved by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise, on behalf of the\r\n\r\nParty and the other Member and myself in this House, to say that\r\n\r\nwe support whatever has been said by the Prime Minister.

She was very\r\n\r\ngracious, a woman without airs and easily approachable.  I read\r\n\r\nin the papers that she carried out her duties very bravely and\r\n\r\ncourageously.  No one would know, by looking at her calm and\r\n\r\ndignified surface, that she was internally in great pain and\r\n\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nI read also in the papers that President Ong knew the First Lady\r\n\r\nwhen  he  was  in school and they courted and carried  on  their\r\n\r\ncourtship into the university days and I believe when they  came\r\n\r\nback  to Singapore, they worked together.  They were very  close\r\n\r\nand I believe that they must have been a very loving couple and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it must have been a great loss to the  President  on\r\n\r\nthe untimely death of his beloved wife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I extend my deep sympathy and condolences to the President\r\n\r\nand his family.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

Those of\r\n\r\nus  who  know her personally, know her for her kind  and  gentle\r\n\r\nways  in  which she carried herself. She had won admiration  and\r\n\r\nrespect for her simple and humble personality.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had the privilege of attending a number of\r\n\r\nreceptions  and dinners hosted by the President  and  the  First\r\n\r\nLady.   At these occasions, she was always an excellent  hostess\r\n\r\nwho  went  out of her way to show her concern and care  for  the\r\n\r\nguests, in fact, every guest. She would be deeply missed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have also come to know her as a brave and\r\n\r\ncourageous person who had carried out her duties as First  Lady,\r\n\r\ndespite her illness.  Her smile, an infectious smile, often gave\r\n\r\naway  little  clue of her physical condition and often  made  us\r\n\r\nbelieve that she was feeling better.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past weekend, at several of my\r\n\r\nconstituency functions, many grassroots leaders, residents and\r\n\r\neven children had expressed words of sympathy and sorrow at her\r\n\r\nsudden demise. One resident who was emotional said that she felt\r\n\r\nas if she had lost a member of her family.  Such are the\r\n\r\nfeelings of Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Indian Singaporeans and Indian organisations have also\r\n\r\nexpressed  their  grief and sorrow at the passing  of  Mrs  Ong.\r\n\r\nThey  share  the  sorrow of President Ong, his  family  and  the\r\n\r\nnation.   The  Hindu  Endowments Board  plans  to  hold  special\r\n\r\nprayers in memory of Mrs Ong at its four temples tonight.   Many\r\n\r\nHindu devotees are expected to join in in the prayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans from all walks of life, different races and\r\n\r\nreligions feel the loss with great sorrow.  It is this emotional\r\n\r\nbind that bonds us as one people.  Mrs Ong will be deeply missed\r\n\r\nand fondly remembered by us all.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony</b>\r\n\r\n<b>Tan Keng Yam):</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join in this\r\n\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family and I have known Siew May for over 20 years since\r\n\r\nI  entered politics in 1979.  We always found her to be kind and\r\n\r\ngracious  and considerate in the concern for others.   Siew  May\r\n\r\nwas a brave woman.  My wife and I last saw her on 20th July when\r\n\r\nshe was in hospital having a blood transfusion.  She was sitting\r\n\r\non a couch holding a pillow, speaking to her grandson. She spoke\r\n\r\nanimatedly about family matters and preparations for the opening\r\n\r\nof the Nanyang Girls' High School.  She was at that time in pain\r\n\r\nbut  she  showed no signs of it and conducted herself cheerfully\r\n\r\nand as graciously as ever.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the work for education, particularly for the Nanyang\r\n\r\nGirls'  High School, for charity, in the way she carried herself\r\n\r\nand  lived  her  life, Siew May was a model for  many  women  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Her passing away is a sad loss, not  only  for  the\r\n\r\nPresident and his family, but for the whole nation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t Sir, I support the motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin  Saniff)  (In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir,  every  living\r\n\r\nthing  has  to pass away.  But that has many ways and, according\r\n\r\nto  a  Malay  idiom,  when a tiger dies, it  leaves  behind  its\r\n\r\nstripes  but for us human beings, we will leave behind our  good\r\n\r\nname  and respect. Khairil Anwar, a poet, said that one's legacy\r\n\r\nremains  even  after it has passed away.  I  believe  all  these\r\n\r\nidioms  can  make  ourselves understand about Mrs  Ong  who  has\r\n\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Deputy Prime Minister, Dr Tony Tan, my family and\r\n\r\nI  have  known  her  since  I  was appointed  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Minister for Communications and Culture.  I was\r\n\r\nthe  Parliamentary Secretary to President Ong who  was  at  that\r\n\r\ntime  the  Minister for both the Ministries, and what  has  been\r\n\r\nsaid in this House by my colleagues is true.  For my wife and I,\r\n\r\nwhenever we had special meetings with her at Istana or at  other\r\n\r\nplaces,  we always talked about the future, our children,  their\r\n\r\nexperiences in National Service and what we have done for  them.\r\n\r\nPresident Ong and the First Lady have given us strength when  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  perform  our duties during a period of  certainty  and\r\n\r\nuncertainty.  Her departure has left an impact on the  people  - the  students, the workers, as has been said by Mr Lim Boon Heng\r\n\r\nand including those who are unable to come close to her but have\r\n\r\nseen her from far away - who have found her departure as a loss.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what I feel about her contribution to the prosperity\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  Just like the Malay idiom that says that when  a\r\n\r\ntiger  dies, it will leave behind its stripes but when  a  human\r\n\r\nbeing dies he will leave behind his honour and respect.  That is\r\n\r\nthe actual meaning of death and whether we die at the age of 30,\r\n\r\n40  or 50 years old, is secondary.  The important thing is  that\r\n\r\nwe have made our life meaningful in many ways, like contributing\r\n\r\nto  our  society.   My family and I feel this loss  and  we  are\r\n\r\ngrateful  that we have got friends who are older whom  we  treat\r\n\r\nlike our sisters and brothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\tI fully express my condolences to President Ong and\r\n\r\nhis family, as stated by the Prime Minister just now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I wholeheartedly\r\n\r\nsupport the Prime Minister's motion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, like the speakers before me, our hearts do go out to\r\n\r\nPresident  Ong  and  his  family  during  this  time  of   their\r\n\r\nbereavement.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, I think this\r\n\r\nmotion  finds resonance all across Singapore because we can  see\r\n\r\nhow  many  Singaporeans from all walks of  life,  regardless  of\r\n\r\nrace,  gender, age  -   how they have actually flocked to attend\r\n\r\nthe wake because they respected and cared for the First Lady.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, I would like to support\r\n\r\nthe  motion by the Prime Minister and on behalf of my fellow GPC\r\n\r\nChairmen and the Members extend our deepest condolences  to  the\r\n\r\nPresident  and his family on the untimely demise  of  the  First\r\n\r\nLady.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much truth in the statement that behind every\r\n\r\nsuccessful man is a supportive woman. The President's  long  and\r\n\r\nillustrious  career  spans the private and  public  sectors,  in\r\n\r\npolitical  office,  culminating in the present  high  office  of\r\n\r\nPresident.   Throughout the past 36 years, the  First  Lady  had\r\n\r\nbeen most supportive of her husband.  She continued to lead  the\r\n\r\narchitectural business of the family when her husband  became  a\r\n\r\nMinister in the Government.  As a loving mother, she brought  up\r\n\r\nthe family of two sons, not to mention looking after her husband\r\n\r\nwhen  he  himself fell sick.  As First Lady, she had done  much,\r\n\r\nmore  than  a fair share of charity work, and lent her  personal\r\n\r\nsupport  to  a  host  of social services.  It  would  have  been\r\n\r\ndifficult enough to juggle these three jobs when one is healthy.\r\n\r\nIt  would be too much to expect the First Lady to continue doing\r\n\r\nthem  when she herself was stricken with cancer two and  a  half\r\n\r\nyears ago.  To the amazement of all Singaporeans, the First Lady\r\n\r\ntook  her  illness  in her stride. She worked  tirelessly  until\r\n\r\nalmost to the end.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHer  positive attitude to life, living  it  to  the\r\n\r\nfull,  and  making  a  full  contribution  to  her  family   and\r\n\r\nSingapore,  despite daunting odds, deserves our full  admiration\r\n\r\nand our thanks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will all miss her as she had touched our lives in one\r\n\r\nway  or another. We will all have warm memories of the good that\r\n\r\nshe has done for Singapore directly and through her husband.  My\r\n\r\nown  wish  is that with time, the President will come  to  terms\r\n\r\nwith  the  loss of his loved one in the comfort that  the  First\r\n\r\nLady  in  her time, had made contributions to Singapore that  he\r\n\r\nwould  be very proud of and we will all remember.

MOM together with MOF  is\r\n\r\nstudying this, to see if there is any justification for allowing\r\n\r\ntax efficient pension schemes as the Member has suggested.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1999/19990803/19990803-HA-0701867.htm\">LIST - SSTD SHAREHOLDERS (Cols. 1867-1870)</a><br>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
