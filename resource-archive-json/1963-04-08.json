I  agree  with  the  Member  that   a\r\n\r\nsimilarly useful role can be played by a Commission\r\n\r\nof  Inquiry  in respect of Communist activities  in\r\n\r\nthe trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, at the moment, another Commission\r\n\r\npending  at  the request of the Singapore  National\r\n\r\nUnion  of  Journalists.

The question is to find  when  a  High\r\n\r\nCourt  Judge  will be free to undertake  what  will\r\n\r\nundoubtedly become a long, protracted and sometimes\r\n\r\nperhaps  acrimonious proceedings. The  Member  will\r\n\r\nremember  that the former Chief Justice retired  in\r\n\r\nJanuary  this  year and we are at  the  moment  one\r\n\r\nPuisne Judge short.

The Prime Minister,  in\r\n\r\nindicating that he accepts the suggestion  for  the\r\n\r\nappointment of this Commission, left it limited  to\r\n\r\nthe question of Communist subversion. I ask whether\r\n\r\nthe  Prime Minister did that by accident or whether\r\n\r\nit  is  intended in the spirit of the  question  to\r\n\r\nappoint  a Commission to inquire into all political\r\n\r\nactivities and all political infiltration of  trade\r\n\r\nunions,  whether  registered political  Parties  or\r\n\r\nnot - the \"not\", of course, being the Communists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\ndistinction  between Communist operators  and  non-Communist  infiltrators  does  not  lie  in   their\r\n\r\nbelonging   to  a  registered  or  an  unregistered\r\n\r\nsociety.

That is in the  nature\r\n\r\nof  things  in Singapore. I take it that the  point\r\n\r\nthe Member for Anson wanted to make was - have I,  in\r\n\r\nframing  this  reply, taken into consideration  his\r\n\r\nother point, to investigate the activities of  non-Communist  political leaders in the  trade  unions.\r\n\r\nBut   hypothesi,   if   they  are   non-Communists,\r\n\r\ntherefore it cannot he for subversive ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is\r\n\r\n\"setting  up a Commission of Inquiry with  specific\r\n\r\nreference to infiltration\", and the aim is to  free\r\n\r\nthe  working-class movement from  its  thraldom  to\r\n\r\npolitical Parties. That would be the aim of such  a\r\n\r\nCommission. My enquiry is: does the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\naccept  the position that the trade union  movement\r\n\r\nshould be free from slavery to any political Party,\r\n\r\nand  that  a  Commission would  help  immensely  in\r\n\r\nclarifying the position and in probably paving  the\r\n\r\nway for legislation for their protection?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that opens\r\n\r\nup  an  entirely  new aspect  of  the  case.  As  I\r\n\r\nunderstand it, the Member for Anson is now thinking\r\n\r\nin  terms  of  legislation to free the trade  union\r\n\r\nmovement  from thraldom - is it thraldom? I have  not\r\n\r\ngot  the  Oxford  Dictionary with me  here,  but  I\r\n\r\nassume,  by  that, that the Member for Anson  means\r\n\r\nthat  one is held enthralled by the other. If  that\r\n\r\nis   so  and  if  the  purpose  is  then  to   make\r\n\r\nrecommendations for legislation so  that  no  trade\r\n\r\nunion  can  either subscribe to, belong to  or  pay\r\n\r\nsubscriptions  to  a political Party,  I  am  quite\r\n\r\nhappy  to consider that. But infiltration  by  non-Communists  into  trade  unions  and  trade   union\r\n\r\ncommittees    is   just   like   some   businessmen\r\n\r\ninfiltrating    into   direct   directorships    of\r\n\r\ncompanies. It goes on regularly. The same man,  for\r\n\r\ninstance, turns up in 20 different companies-Fraser\r\n\r\n& Neave, Malayan Breweries, Red Lion, etc. By sheer\r\n\r\npersistence  and great skill in the  management  of\r\n\r\ncommittees, the same person appears over  and  over\r\n\r\nagain  in the directorship lists of many companies,\r\n\r\nthereby   no  doubt  invoking  a  great   deal   of\r\n\r\nconfidence amongst the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npublic   and   the   consumers   of   the   various\r\n\r\ncommodities.  So  too  with  trade  unionists.  One\r\n\r\nbecomes an adviser, a general affairs officer,  and\r\n\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the objection to these persons is not that\r\n\r\nthey work in trade unions but that they should work\r\n\r\nfor  the  purposes of the Communist Party in  trade\r\n\r\nunions.  [Interruption] No, Mr Speaker,  Sir.  Any\r\n\r\nother  political beliefs by all means. I sympathise\r\n\r\nwith  the  Member for Anson. Twice he has lost  his\r\n\r\nParty  whilst  he is still in this Chamber.  I  can\r\n\r\nquite  sympathise with his point of view  that  one\r\n\r\nshould  not work for any political Party at all.  I\r\n\r\nthink  there is reason and logic behind that  point\r\n\r\nof  view  after one has had the bitter  experiences\r\n\r\nthat  he  has  had. Twice the painful  business  of\r\n\r\nbringing  a political Party to fruition; both  came\r\n\r\ninto  life;  one assumed power and one looked  like\r\n\r\ncoming to power and ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

This\r\n\r\nfollows  precedents  in the  United  Kingdom  where\r\n\r\nsubordinate  Courts  do  not  enjoy  the  extensive\r\n\r\npowers of the High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the High Court which has general\r\n\r\nsuperintendence  over the proceedings  of  inferior\r\n\r\nCourts  not  only  to prevent them  from  exceeding\r\n\r\ntheir jurisdiction or otherwise acting contrary  to\r\n\r\nthe   law,   but  also  to  prevent  persons   from\r\n\r\ninterfering  with  the course of  justice  in  such\r\n\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of the Superior Court to punish for\r\n\r\ncontempt  has  been under critical  examination  in\r\n\r\nEngland, and it was considered that such wide power\r\n\r\nshould not be given to the subordinate Courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I agree with the Member for Anson that\r\n\r\nour circumstances are different and I would welcome\r\n\r\nconcrete proposals from members of the Bar and  the\r\n\r\nBar Committee itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons guilty of malicious distortion of court\r\n\r\nproceedings through radio, rediffusion,  television\r\n\r\nand  press  reporting can be dealt with  adequately\r\n\r\nunder  the  present  laws for  contempt  under  the\r\n\r\nexisting provisions of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>APPLICABILITY OF PRINCIPLE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>OF \"OMBUDSMAN\" TO</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth and Law whether he would consider the report\r\n\r\nof   Sir  John  Whyatt  on  \"The  Citizen  and  the\r\n\r\nAdministration\"   and   the   legislation   arising\r\n\r\ntherefrom  in  New Zealand in the  context  of  the\r\n\r\npossibility  of the applicability of the  principle\r\n\r\nof \"Ombudsman\" to Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the report of Sir\r\n\r\nJohn Whyatt on \"The Citizen and the Administration\"\r\n\r\nand   the  legislation  arising  therefrom  in  New\r\n\r\nZealand  have  been carefully considered,  but  the\r\n\r\nview  of the Government is that it is premature  to\r\n\r\napply the principle of \"Ombudsman\" in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already in existence in Singapore\r\n\r\ndepartments  that  cover  to  a  great  extent  the\r\n\r\npowers, sphere of operations, rights and duties  of\r\n\r\nan  Ombudsman.

One  of  these\r\n\r\ndifficulties is the right of the Ombudsman to  look\r\n\r\ninto  secret  files of Ministers as well  as  State\r\n\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile   the  Whyatt  Report  recommends  that   the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Commissioner should have security  of\r\n\r\ntenure  in  the same way as the Auditor General  in\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, in New Zealand he holds office  only\r\n\r\nfor  the duration of Parliament.

The newspapers somehow or other  come\r\n\r\nunder great pressure not to print our publications.\r\n\r\nIt  looks as if our only venue of free speech  left\r\n\r\nis  the  Legislative Assembly. For things  said  in\r\n\r\nthis  Assembly,  the papers will  probably  give  a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount  of space. This  will  allow  other\r\n\r\npeople  to  read what we have said. But surely  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   need   not  fear  this   because   the\r\n\r\nnewspapers  are devoting two-thirds of their  space\r\n\r\nto  the  P.A.P.;  only one-third of  the  space  is\r\n\r\nreserved   for  all  the  Opposition  Members   put\r\n\r\ntogether.  So  the  Government need  not  fear  our\r\n\r\nspeaking  our minds in the Legislative Assembly.  I\r\n\r\nwould  ask the Government not to make a mockery  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy  and guillotine the debate  in  order  to\r\n\r\nsuppress   still   further  whatever   freedom   of\r\n\r\nexpression there is left in this Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is some\r\n\r\nvalidity in the suggestion that the session  should\r\n\r\nbe   permitted  to  continue  for  as  long  as  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  complete the  work  on  the  matters\r\n\r\nlegitimately on the Order Paper. It was  originally\r\n\r\nsuggested by the Government - and it seemed  a  fair\r\n\r\nsuggestion - that  there should be midnight  sittings\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday, Saturday, and Monday to Thursday inclusive.\r\n\r\nI  do not quite know why there has been a change of\r\n\r\nviews because, on the original plan as indicated by\r\n\r\nthe  Leader  of  the  House, there  was  reasonable\r\n\r\nprobability  of the completion of the  work  before\r\n\r\nthe House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Leader of the Barisan asked a rhetorical\r\n\r\nquestion,  whether the work of the Assembly  should\r\n\r\nstop  because the Prime Minister has  to  attend  a\r\n\r\nconference elsewhere. It is a legitimate  question,\r\n\r\nand  probably it is a legitimate answer that in  so\r\n\r\nsmall a House where the Prime Minister needs to go,\r\n\r\nperhaps with some other Ministerial colleagues, for\r\n\r\na  major conference, it is necessary to adjourn the\r\n\r\nHouse during the period of that conference. But  is\r\n\r\nit  necessary  to adjourn it for  as  long  as  two\r\n\r\nmonths?  I  can understand, Sir, the  need  for  an\r\n\r\nadjournment when they are away if, in fact,  it  is\r\n\r\ngoing to be more than one Minister who is going  to\r\n\r\nbe    away,   perhaps   with   some   parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretaries involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plea that I would like to make here, to a\r\n\r\nsense    of    responsibility   to   constitutional\r\n\r\nprocedure,  is that the Government majority  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  used to foreclose discussions  on  matters\r\n\r\nlegitimately before the House where there has  been\r\n\r\nno  suggestion at all of any abuse of time  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the Opposition, any seeking unnecessarily\r\n\r\nto  lengthen the proceedings. So I should  like  to\r\n\r\nsee  some suggestion made whereby we could  perhaps\r\n\r\nreconvene at an earlier date until the business  on\r\n\r\nthe Order Paper is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I made the\r\n\r\nposition of the Government quite clear when I spoke\r\n\r\non  Friday  afternoon.  We  were  prepared  to  sit\r\n\r\nFriday,   Saturday,  Monday,   and   Tuesday   till\r\n\r\nmidnight,  an  extra  four  hours  everyday  or  an\r\n\r\nequivalent of an extra thee full-day sittings.  But\r\n\r\nI  think  Members of the Opposition  must  realise,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the Members of the Barisan  Sosialis,\r\n\r\nthat they are not the whole world and if some other\r\n\r\nsections  of the Opposition do not desire  sittings\r\n\r\non Saturdays, there is no reason why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should force its way  through  and\r\n\r\nhave  a  sitting on a Saturday. Hence the  Saturday\r\n\r\nsitting  went by the board. We were quite  prepared\r\n\r\nand  ready  to  go  on  from half-past  two  to  12\r\n\r\nmidnight.  Today, as the Leader  o  the  House  has\r\n\r\nstated, we are quite prepared to sit till midnight;\r\n\r\nso also tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday morning, as the Member for Queenstown\r\n\r\nknows, the Minister for Finance, I and a few  other\r\n\r\ncolleagues  plus all the important  officials,  the\r\n\r\nState Advocate-General in particular, will have  to\r\n\r\nbe  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  I do  not  think  there  is\r\n\r\nanything  on the Order Paper - I say this with  great\r\n\r\nrespect to the Member for Queenstown - which is more\r\n\r\nimportant  than  what we are going  to  discuss  in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur.  If I had thought  it  otherwise,  I\r\n\r\nwould have stayed here and postponed the meeting in\r\n\r\nKuala  Lumpur. I would share his concern if I  were\r\n\r\nhim. I would be deeply grieved to see the Communist\r\n\r\nunited   front  somewhat  inert  because  all   the\r\n\r\ntransistors  have been pulled out. The loudspeakers\r\n\r\nare  there; the network of wires is there, but  the\r\n\r\nthing  that  gives out the sound  is  missing;  and\r\n\r\nuntil  the  underground  decides  to  put  in   new\r\n\r\ntransistors,  the  set  is  inert.  I   share   his\r\n\r\nbreavement but I cannot, in any seriousness,  admit\r\n\r\nhis  purely formulastic motion of condemnation,  of\r\n\r\nno   confidence  in  the  Government,  because  the\r\n\r\nPeople's  Action  Party has pro-colonial  policies.\r\n\r\nAre we to stay here and listen to old recordings of\r\n\r\nthings  said and done with? And worse, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  am quite convinced that if we were to  sit\r\n\r\ntill  midnight  today and tomorrow, we  would  more\r\n\r\nthan  likely  finish  the business,  for  the  very\r\n\r\nsimple  reason as was illustrated, I think vividly,\r\n\r\njust  now. Without the transistors, there  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle sound coming out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the Member for Anson to gather the\r\n\r\nOpposition   together  and  vote  for  a   midnight\r\n\r\nsitting.   The   Government  has  no   overwhelming\r\n\r\nmajority  to  force its way through. In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can be defeated. We can have  a  general\r\n\r\nelection  all  on a motion for the adjournment.  We\r\n\r\nare  quite prepared for that. There is no  bullying\r\n\r\npossible. We are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompletely at the mercy of the Opposition and we do\r\n\r\njust  as  the  Opposition  pleases,  provided,   of\r\n\r\ncourse, it is in the interests of the country. I do\r\n\r\nnot think it is in the interests of the country for\r\n\r\nmy  colleagues  and I to leave uncompleted  matters\r\n\r\nwhich  concern the future of Singapore in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nHowever grave the problems of the detainees,  their\r\n\r\nfood,  their reading material and their  recreation\r\n\r\nmay  be  to  the  Member for Queenstown,  I  cannot\r\n\r\nconcede  that that is a more important subject  for\r\n\r\nus  to  concentrate on and to bend our energies  to\r\n\r\nthan  to  the  future  welfare  and  well-being  of\r\n\r\nSingapore in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the decision is in the hands of the\r\n\r\nOpposition. They can sit tonight till midnight  and\r\n\r\ntomorrow  till midnight. We will adjourn  till  the\r\n\r\n7th  of  June  formally. But  the  moment  we  have\r\n\r\nfinished these negotiations, and they are intricate\r\n\r\nnegotiations,  Sir - in fact, in the middle  of  this\r\n\r\nsitting I will have to be excused for a few minutes\r\n\r\nfrom  this  Chamber in order that I can go  through\r\n\r\ncertain  Defence estimates - defence of Malaysia.  We\r\n\r\nmust   properly  appraise  ourselves  of  our  fair\r\n\r\ncontribution. Is there to be a power vacuum in this\r\n\r\nregion?  If there is not, who is to take the  place\r\n\r\nof  the  British forces who will no longer  play  a\r\n\r\npart  in  internal security? Are we to  raise  four\r\n\r\nbattalions and at what cost? Who is to pay for  the\r\n\r\nfour  battalions? Who will buy arms for  them?  All\r\n\r\nthese   are   matters   of   great   cogency    and\r\n\r\nimportance - not  of  academic  importance.   Members\r\n\r\nopposite may talk of revolution in academic  terms,\r\n\r\nbut  the people who manipulate, the people who  are\r\n\r\nnow    rendered    inert,    are    not    academic\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries. They are capable of  mounting  the\r\n\r\nbarricades. So we want to be quite sure that  there\r\n\r\nare the right number of men in the right number  of\r\n\r\nplaces with the right quantity of equipment to meet\r\n\r\nthese  people when the time comes. Without  wishing\r\n\r\nto  offend the House, I say I do not think we  have\r\n\r\nany  serious business on. We reconvene  this  House\r\n\r\nfor  one  simple  reason - but  not  because  of  the\r\n\r\npressure   of  public  opinion.  The  public   were\r\n\r\nrelieved that for once there was peace and quiet in\r\n\r\nSingapore  for  a  good solid  seven  months  while\r\n\r\nconstruction and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress forged ahead. People wanted to see the end\r\n\r\nof  all  this  acrimony, these  long-winded  futile\r\n\r\ndebates.  We reconvened because the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara  had  to  go on Haj, and we  must  have  the\r\n\r\nAssembly  in  readiness for  the  moment  when  the\r\n\r\ntreaty is ready, because that is the moment when we\r\n\r\nwill  have  to  adopt  formally  all  the  amending\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Constitution before I can  attach\r\n\r\nmy  signature to it in London. It is as  simple  as\r\n\r\nthat.  The  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech  is  a\r\n\r\nbroad  outline of what really can only  be  another\r\n\r\nfour  and  a half months of Singapore as  we  know.\r\n\r\nAfter  that, it will be Singapore against  a  wider\r\n\r\nperspective, a larger horizon, where the  sound  of\r\n\r\nsmall  crackers in a confined room will be lost  in\r\n\r\nthe infinity of the spaces of Malaysia - and I do not\r\n\r\nadvise  firing  crackers  unnecessarily  at   wrong\r\n\r\npeople  in Malaya. That is the reason why  we  have\r\n\r\nreconvened. There is nothing of urgency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, who is the first to press\r\n\r\nfor  the  rights  and liberty of  men,  freedom  of\r\n\r\nspeech,  never  wrote to the Leader  of  the  House\r\n\r\nasking  for an emergency sitting over the  arrests.\r\n\r\nThere was no excitement and ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of elucidation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Prime Minister permit a\r\n\r\npoint of explanation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Surely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Because the Member for Anson, it\r\n\r\nseems  unlike  the  distinguished  lawyers  on  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  Bench, was conscious  that  you  cannot\r\n\r\ncall   an  emergency  sitting  before  the   Negara\r\n\r\nconvenes the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought so too, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, over a Press conference, and I thought perhaps\r\n\r\nat  least  he could register a point and  call  for\r\n\r\none. The Member for Hong Lim made a bit of noise in\r\n\r\nthe  Press  about  reconvening. He  never  formally\r\n\r\nwrote  to  the Leader of the House for an emergency\r\n\r\nsession. What would he say if there was one? A very\r\n\r\ndifficult moment for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould he side with the Barisan and end up like  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  in the gutter? Can he distinguish  himself\r\n\r\nso finely apart from the Barisan that when one part\r\n\r\nof  the  wheel crashes into the gutter,  the  other\r\n\r\npart  still  goes  on  to the straight  highway  of\r\n\r\nsuccess?  These are things only possible for  trick\r\n\r\ncyclists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody was really excited.\r\n\r\nWe  reconvened  this sitting for no special  reason\r\n\r\nthan that we must have the Assembly in readiness to\r\n\r\nadopt  the constitutional provisions which  are  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment  being  drafted and  which  cannot  be\r\n\r\nfinalised  until  the financial  arrangements  have\r\n\r\nbeen tied up. In between this session, I shall have\r\n\r\nto  sit  down  with certain military gentlemen  who\r\n\r\nknow  more about these matters than I do, and  find\r\n\r\nout  what  would be a fair share of the defence  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  in  Malaysia. This  is  very  important,\r\n\r\nbecause upon that turns the question of whether our\r\n\r\nannual   surpluses,  which  we  have   deliberately\r\n\r\ncontrived every year of over $100 million, shall go\r\n\r\ninto Toa Payoh and build 50,000 units; build houses\r\n\r\nfor  50,000 people at Outram Prison, reclaim 20,000\r\n\r\nacres  of  land from Bedok to Nicoll's Highway.  Or\r\n\r\nare   we   to  sink  it  buying  guns,  submarines,\r\n\r\nhelicopters, waiting for a war with neighbours with\r\n\r\nwhom  we  want to be friends? These are  important\r\n\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry to appear harsh to the Member for\r\n\r\nQueenstown.  I do not think he has anything  really\r\n\r\nworth  saying or the papers would have printed  it.\r\n\r\nIf  he had some startling analysis of the political\r\n\r\nfuture  of  Singapore, surely he would have  caught\r\n\r\nthe attention of some newspaper editor or a foreign\r\n\r\njournalist. In fact, I know several. I know one who\r\n\r\nasked  for an interview with him and he refused  to\r\n\r\ngive  an  interview. He is shy of  reporters  these\r\n\r\ndays,  Mr Speaker. He has found out that  charging\r\n\r\nhead-tong  like a rugger forward into a brick  wall\r\n\r\ncan be a very painful business. I tell him that the\r\n\r\nbest  thing  he can do in the circumstances  is  to\r\n\r\nsubmit  with good grace. Malaysia is coming.  There\r\n\r\nis  just four and a half months to go.

I can assure the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Queenstown,  having slugged it  out  blow  for\r\n\r\nblow, word for word, through all these months  with\r\n\r\nhis mentors over the radio, on the public platform,\r\n\r\nthat we will offer him now ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

The Member for Anson was there. If  only  we\r\n\r\nhad  both the sound and the vision! I remember  one\r\n\r\nfamous  occasion.  Though that was  the  time  when\r\n\r\nreally  the  moment for decision  was  coming.  The\r\n\r\nbattle  was won, fought or lost - fought and won  or\r\n\r\nlost  there.  The  Member for  Queenstown  dithered\r\n\r\nwhether  he  was  to appear or  not  to  appear.  3\r\n\r\no'clock  came.  We  were waiting  for  him  at  the\r\n\r\nstudio. His mentors were not certain. To be or  not\r\n\r\nto  be! Suddenly he appeared - at quarter-past three.\r\n\r\nAnd   he   belched,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir!  Oh,   the\r\n\r\nexcitement  of it! I offered him a carminative.  He\r\n\r\nwas so angry that I should think that he, a doctor,\r\n\r\ndid  not carry a carminative with him, and said  he\r\n\r\nhad it in his pocket. I thought, if people want  to\r\n\r\ngo  to  battle, they must be prepared for all this,\r\n\r\nand  they  must  know when the bells  have  already\r\n\r\nrung.  The  referee  has said the  round  is  over.\r\n\r\nMalaysia  is  coming.

I  hope they will not  find  me  too\r\n\r\ntroublesome. But I do offer this advice.  There  is\r\n\r\nonly  four  and  a  half months to  go,  so  please\r\n\r\ncontain  themselves.

Members, from the  Southern\r\n\r\nIslands  and  Kampong Kembangan, were  in  fact  an\r\n\r\nindictment against our society. For a poor  man  to\r\n\r\nrisk  $700  to  $1,000  of his hard-earned  savings\r\n\r\nbuying  a  house which he knows may well be  pulled\r\n\r\ndown  - and  often he is asked to go into occupation\r\n\r\nin  the  middle of the night - he must be in a fairly\r\n\r\ndesperate   position.   The   problem   has    been\r\n\r\nconsiderably alleviated in the urban areas, in  the\r\n\r\ncity areas, as a result of massive building of low-cost  housing by the Housing and Development Board.\r\n\r\nBut there is no obvious solution to the problem  in\r\n\r\nthe rural areas. This Bill seeks summary powers for\r\n\r\nthe rural areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malays in particular have not taken to\r\n\r\nflat dwelling, except when they have moved together\r\n\r\nen  bloc either as part of the Regiment, or as part\r\n\r\nof  the  Police  Force, or as part of  the  Customs\r\n\r\nUnit.  But in the city where they have so  adjusted\r\n\r\nthemselves, the problem can be alleviated. However,\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas, they have shown  a  definite\r\n\r\npreference for a house with a piece\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof land attached to it, which means a piece of land\r\n\r\non which chickens and ducks and birds and so on can\r\n\r\nbe  kept.  I  am sorry to say that the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board has not as yet developed or found\r\n\r\na plan which will allow maximum utilisation of land\r\n\r\nfor such purposes. The lands which the Malays would\r\n\r\nlike  to have for settlement are too near the  city\r\n\r\nfor us to gazette as settlement areas. They are too\r\n\r\nvaluable for just the ordinary kampong house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands we have available they consider are too\r\n\r\nfar  from  the  city. It is really  a  sociological\r\n\r\nproblem the answer to which must be found in either\r\n\r\ndeveloping   a  kind  of  house  which   would   be\r\n\r\neconomical or multi-storey houses with a  piece  of\r\n\r\nland nearby - which has been done in other countries;\r\n\r\nthey  live in flats and they all have little  plots\r\n\r\nof  land on which they keep their chickens or  grow\r\n\r\ntheir vegetables - or we must reconcile ourselves  to\r\n\r\nthis constant repetition of illegal structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Kampong Kembangan on Friday\r\n\r\nevening  drew my attention to three or four  houses\r\n\r\nin  particular in his constituency, and I have  had\r\n\r\ninvestigations made into these houses. In the first\r\n\r\nplace,  Mr Speaker, Sir, before any building  plan\r\n\r\ncan  be  passed, the owner of the land must signify\r\n\r\nhis  consent  that he allows this  building  to  be\r\n\r\nerected  or to have been erected on his land.  Part\r\n\r\nof  that land in Kampong Kembangan belongs  to  the\r\n\r\nAlsagoff  Estate.  One  of  it  is  known  as   the\r\n\r\nPerseverance  Estate and the beneficiaries  are  at\r\n\r\nthis  moment  in the process of litigation  in  the\r\n\r\nHigh  Court and nobody can give any consent to  any\r\n\r\nbuilding.  The three families that I  was  referred\r\n\r\nto,  I  am  sorry to say, knowingly undertook  that\r\n\r\nrisk  when they built. When they put wood and  zinc\r\n\r\ntogether,  they  knew that the  beneficiaries  were\r\n\r\nsquabbling  at the High Court over the  Estate  and\r\n\r\nthey  run the risk of having it smacked down. I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know what the exact position is at the moment - whether  the house is still standing or has already\r\n\r\nbeen  demolished - but I give this assurance  to  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan, that I will look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninto the matter and treat it with as much\r\n\r\nconsideration as I can because of the loss that\r\n\r\nthey have incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives me no pleasure in moving this Bill, but I think Members will agree that it is a necessary one. We must, however, try and find a solution to this, and I hope that Members opposite whose constituents always express their preference for the Malay-type of kampong\r\n\r\nhouse  would  help  us  in finding  this  solution.\r\n\r\nHaving  gone  into  the matter at  some  length  on\r\n\r\nseveral  occasions with my Parliamentary Secretary,\r\n\r\nI  do  not see any sizable piece of land acceptable\r\n\r\nto  the Malays as sufficiently near the city to  be\r\n\r\ngazetted  as a Malay settlement. There  are  little\r\n\r\nbits and pieces in Sembawang; a little bit more  in\r\n\r\nKaki  Bukit  near  Kampong Kembangan;  then  it  is\r\n\r\nexhausted. Then they have to go really out into the\r\n\r\nulu. Then there is the problem of children going to\r\n\r\nschool; the problem of roads, light, water  and  so\r\n\r\non.  Alternatively, if they will give this  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai project, where we are putting up some 500 odd\r\n\r\nunits meant primarily for the people in the area, a\r\n\r\nreal try and if they will take to flat dwelling, we\r\n\r\ncan  arrange  to give them bits of land  for  their\r\n\r\nchickens and fowls and other animals nearby. That I\r\n\r\nthink  is the only possible solution to what  is  a\r\n\r\nvery difficult situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. -[The Prime Minister]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.51 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 inclusive ordered to stand part of\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, I have an\r\n\r\namendment to propose - that sub-clause (4)  of clause\r\n\r\n3 be deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, to leave out lines 16 to 18 inclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 3 deals with the offence of having put\r\n\r\nup  a building and then selling it to some innocent\r\n\r\nvictim.

Work\r\n\r\non  this has already begun to enable the new  Power\r\n\r\nStation to be in operation by December 1964. Recent\r\n\r\nindustrial  developments round the Labrador  Nature\r\n\r\nReserve  has resulted in isolation of this reserve,\r\n\r\nand  we  are led to the conclusion that  this  land\r\n\r\nwould better serve the needs of Singapore as a site\r\n\r\nfor  future  industrial expansion  rather  than  to\r\n\r\ncontinue as a Nature Reserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nature Reserves Board has also been consulted\r\n\r\nregarding  this proposal. The Board  has  also  put\r\n\r\nforward the view that it is quite possible that the\r\n\r\neffluence  of  noxious gases from the  Maruzen  Oil\r\n\r\nRefinery  will  seriously  disturb  the  biological\r\n\r\nbalance  in  the reserve. The Board is prepared  to\r\n\r\nrelease  the whole of this area and have asked  for\r\n\r\nanother  area in exchange. My Ministry  is  looking\r\n\r\nfor  suitable sites in conjunction with the  Nature\r\n\r\nReserves Board, and as soon as agreement is reached\r\n\r\nby  all  concerned,  a further resolution  will  be\r\n\r\nmoved in this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electricity consumption has shown increased trends\r\n\r\nand  it  is expected that demand will exceed supply\r\n\r\nin  the  first  quarter of 1965.

Instead  of three  separate  posts  of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Directors  of  Gardens,  Keeper  of  the\r\n\r\nHerbarium and Botanists, there are now three  posts\r\n\r\nof Botanists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved - (for text of resolution, see footnote at\r\n\r\ncols. 165-6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SPEECH</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, for the fourth\r\n\r\nsuccessive  year, it is my privilege  to  move  the\r\n\r\nformal vote of thanks to His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan \r\n\r\nNegara  for his speech to this  Assembly*. The  years  since June 1959 have been eventful  and\r\n\r\nfateful. There were moments in 1961 when the lesser\r\n\r\nspirits amongst us in this Chamber thought that the\r\n\r\nbattle  was  lost,  that all that  we  stood  for - a\r\n\r\ndemocratic,  non-Communist, socialist society - would\r\n\r\nbe  swept  under  the relentless onslaught  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists.

But there were many others,  in  this\r\n\r\nChamber  and outside, who never doubted the outcome\r\n\r\nof  the  struggle  and who stood firm  to  see  the\r\n\r\ncountry  through to peace, security and  prosperity\r\n\r\nin Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are less than five months to go before\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  The  moments  of  doubts  are  gone  and\r\n\r\nanxiety  has vanished as people bend their energies\r\n\r\nto  planning and construction for the stable  years\r\n\r\nahead.  I  do  not  say that we have  put  all  our\r\n\r\ntroubles  behind us. Indeed, it would be disastrous\r\n\r\nto  ignore  the  underground  organisation  of  the\r\n\r\nCommunists,  the  constant battle  for  hearts  and\r\n\r\nminds, the relentless process of attrition as  wits\r\n\r\nand  strategy are matched and encounters fought and\r\n\r\nwon or lost temporarily, while the long-term battle\r\n\r\ngoes on - a battle that can be decisively won only by\r\n\r\na  better  life for the people in a more  just  and\r\n\r\nequal society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think it is fair to say that even the most\r\n\r\noptimistic  of  Members on the other  side  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse - or perhaps I should say on the other side  of\r\n\r\nthe   nation - know  that  there  is   no   hope   of\r\n\r\nestablishing  a  Communist  Malaysia  in  the  next\r\n\r\ndecade. Their dreams can only come true if and when\r\n\r\na  Communist Indonesia were to emerge, and  if  and\r\n\r\nwhen  a  Communist Indonesia becomes a success.  We\r\n\r\nhope  that  will  never  happen.  Anyway,  for  the\r\n\r\npresent,  we  must gird ourselves for the  constant\r\n\r\npressure  and pin-pricks that they will exert  over\r\n\r\nany  issue that would excite any group of men  that\r\n\r\nthey could get together to bolster their cause.  If\r\n\r\nthey  cannot get the people at large excited,  they\r\n\r\ntry  to  get  the families of detainees excited  by\r\n\r\nsquatting  outside my office. If  they  cannot  get\r\n\r\nparents and students to stage boycotts, strikes and\r\n\r\nprotests,  they  try to get young men  involved  in\r\n\r\npolitical rallies like the one they held on  Sunday\r\n\r\n24th  last  month. We were interested to  know  who\r\n\r\nattended  that rally. But what was interesting  was\r\n\r\nthat the Chairman of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  and a number  of  his  committee\r\n\r\nmembers  were surprised at the organised attendance\r\n\r\nof  young  school boys, who, unknown to  them,  had\r\n\r\nbeen  separately organised to attend by people  who\r\n\r\nultimately  control  the  people  who  control  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis.  We must never  make  the  grave\r\n\r\nerror of the last Government in believing that  the\r\n\r\nneutralization  of  a  few united  front  activists\r\n\r\ncould  mean  the end of the Communist  capacity  to\r\n\r\norganise  and  agitate  when  the  time  comes  for\r\n\r\nelections.  This has been a temporary  setback  for\r\n\r\nthem  in  what  is  a grim long-term  struggle  for\r\n\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add this note of caution for them.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty between now and the 4\ufffd months before\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to  ensure  that  nothing  is   done   in\r\n\r\nSingapore  contrary to the verdict  of  the  people\r\n\r\ngiven  on  1st September last year. Had  they  been\r\n\r\nwise  and accepted that verdict, they might perhaps\r\n\r\nhave  not  precipitated the  decision  taken  at  a\r\n\r\nmeeting in Kuala Lumpur on 1st February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a friend recently - a personal, and not a\r\n\r\npolitical  friend - Mr  James  Puthucheary - in  Kuala\r\n\r\nLumpur.  It was for old times' sake. He is  one  of\r\n\r\ntheir  bright minds. He would not mind  my  telling\r\n\r\nthis  to  Members on the other side of  the  House,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Member for Thomson, that the  most\r\n\r\nstupid  thing they had done was to keep on fighting\r\n\r\nagainst  Malaysia after the people had  decided  in\r\n\r\nthe referendum that Singapore was for Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

He said that  whatever\r\n\r\nthe  rights  and  wrongs of the  referendum - and  he\r\n\r\nfound  many things wrong with it - once the  decision\r\n\r\nhad  been  taken, that should be  the  end  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter. I think it was a pity that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhe  did  not express this wisdom more cogently  and\r\n\r\neffectively  to  the other leading members  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis earlier, particularly during  the\r\n\r\nperiod just before the Brunei revolt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between now and 31st August, we have one paramount\r\n\r\nresponsibility,  that  is,  to  ensure   that   the\r\n\r\nsituation  does  not  deteriorate,  either  in  the\r\n\r\nefficacy  of  the  organs of the State  or  in  the\r\n\r\noverall calm and stability of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, we will forge ahead with our\r\n\r\nconstruction.  We have some massive  schemes.  They\r\n\r\nshould  be  all well on their way before  the  31st\r\n\r\nAugust. Members already know from the speech of the\r\n\r\nYang  di-Pertuan Negara that Outram Road Gaol  will\r\n\r\nbe  demolished  soon. In fact, I am  informed  that\r\n\r\ndemolition operations have already begun on part of\r\n\r\nthe old gaol. A new modern gaol is being planned in\r\n\r\nBedok  and Changi. The whole site of 36 acres  will\r\n\r\nbe  ready  for building by the end of the year.  On\r\n\r\nthis  hill  of  some 36 acres of  hard  land,  some\r\n\r\nbeautiful  buildings  for  50,000  people  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another massive project that has been started by\r\n\r\nthe  Land  Office  working  with  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board is to re-claim 20,000  acres  of\r\n\r\nland  stretching  from Bedok  right  up  to  Nicoll\r\n\r\nHighway, extending half a mile out to sea along the\r\n\r\nshore-line. Land is valuable in our little  island.\r\n\r\nAn  increasing  population makes it  necessary  not\r\n\r\nonly  that  we build upwards but also that  we  re-claim  all  available land at present partly  under\r\n\r\nwater  from  prawn ponds to building lots.  In  the\r\n\r\nfirst phase of this project, some 50 acres will  be\r\n\r\nready  in  three  months' time near  the  Fisheries\r\n\r\nschool at Bedok 8\ufffd m.s. This is the beginning  and\r\n\r\nwill   be   an  open  park  for  the  time   being.\r\n\r\nEventually,  20,000 acres, nearly three  times  the\r\n\r\nsize  of  Kreta  Ayer  constituency,  will  be  re-claimed,  partly  to  be used by  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board for building and partly for  sale\r\n\r\nto  private  builders - to pay for the  cost  of  the\r\n\r\nreclamation of the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this increase in building, of course, means an\r\n\r\naccelerated   demand  for  public  utilities - water,\r\n\r\nelectricity and gas. It is not only the increase in\r\n\r\npopulation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  the  increase  in  consumption  of  water  and\r\n\r\nelectricity per head of population because of  more\r\n\r\nhomes  and  also  because of  more  standpipes  and\r\n\r\nelectricity supplies to the kampongs and the  rural\r\n\r\nareas. It becomes urgently necessary for us to plan\r\n\r\nahead  for new sources of water and power to ensure\r\n\r\nthat supply always exceeds demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me give a brief illustration of the rate\r\n\r\nof  increase. The Housing and Development Board was\r\n\r\nbuilding at the rate of 12,300 units per annum last\r\n\r\nyear,  and  15,000 units per annum  this  year.  In\r\n\r\nother words, one unit, every 45 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, private developers, reflecting the\r\n\r\ngeneral  prosperity over the last  two  years,  are\r\n\r\nbuilding multi-storied flats all over the City. The\r\n\r\nPlanning  Department under my charge  have  had  to\r\n\r\nmake  some adjustments on density control  to  take\r\n\r\ninto account the realities of urban development  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. An estimated 6,000 units per  annum  are\r\n\r\nbeing put up at present by private developers.  All\r\n\r\nthis means an enormous increase of over 21,000 more\r\n\r\nhomes  per annum all making demands on the  pub-lie\r\n\r\nutilities, water, electricity and gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been fortunate in avoiding water\r\n\r\nrationing   so  far,  in  spite  of  the  prolonged\r\n\r\ndrought,  and  in  spite of  the  large  number  of\r\n\r\nstandpipes that have been installed. There  are  at\r\n\r\nthe moment 2,400 public standpipes, all giving free\r\n\r\nwater.  One-third of these were put up in the  last\r\n\r\ntwo years - 600 of them. The standpipes alone account\r\n\r\nfor more than 12 per cent of the average user of 72\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons a day. I am sorry,  Sir,  that  in\r\n\r\nsome  places, through lack of education and a sense\r\n\r\nof civic responsibility, taps have been left to run\r\n\r\nthroughout the whole night, at a time of  prolonged\r\n\r\ndrought. I would like to urge all householders  who\r\n\r\nlive  near  standpipes to take upon themselves  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility to help the community  to  see  that\r\n\r\nstandpipes  are  not running to  waste  during  the\r\n\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we have avoided water rationing was\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the  ample stocks of  water  built  up\r\n\r\nbefore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  drought,  about  70  per  cent  of  our  total\r\n\r\ncapacity.  Another reason was the increased  output\r\n\r\nin  Tebrau  after  extensions at the  Tebrau  works\r\n\r\ncompleted  in  the middle of last year,  increasing\r\n\r\nthe  daily output from Tebrau from 30 to 45 million\r\n\r\ngallons  per  day. However, I must warn  the  House\r\n\r\nthat  if there is no break in the dry spell in  the\r\n\r\nnext week, we may have to introduce ration' ing  in\r\n\r\norder  to  conserve stocks in preparation  for  the\r\n\r\nnormal  dry  weather expected  in  June,  July  and\r\n\r\nAugust,  as our stocks have gone down from  70  per\r\n\r\ncent  to  54 per cent in the impounding reservoirs,\r\n\r\nthe  16  per cent having been used to make  up  the\r\n\r\ndaily shortage from Tebrau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members will already have known that we are\r\n\r\nplanning  an extension pipeline to take water  from\r\n\r\nScudai  River at a cost of $16 million. This scheme\r\n\r\nwill  be completed in the course of 1964. The first\r\n\r\nphase  has  already  started, and  when  operations\r\n\r\ncommence  towards the end of this year, 15  million\r\n\r\ngallons  a  day can be added to our water supplies.\r\n\r\nIn  the  course of next year, when the whole  works\r\n\r\nare  completed,  a  total of 30 million  additional\r\n\r\ngallons per day can be extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may know that last year we invited a firm\r\n\r\nof  water consultants approved by the World Bank to\r\n\r\nadvise  us.  The  World Bank will only  give  loans\r\n\r\nafter advice of water consultants approved by them.\r\n\r\nA fee of nearly half-a-million dollars was paid for\r\n\r\na  thorough  survey of our water needs.  They  have\r\n\r\nmade  certain recommendations thereon, one of which\r\n\r\nwas that we should proceed with the Scudai project,\r\n\r\nwhilst  work  commences on the  main  Johore  River\r\n\r\nproject.  Johore River - first phase to be  completed\r\n\r\nby  the  end  of 1967 - will bring an additional  30\r\n\r\nmillion  gallons  per day and,  when  completed  in\r\n\r\n1976,  will bring 60 million gallons per day.  This\r\n\r\nscheme is expected to cost a total of $70 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A World Bank loan for the Scudai River, Johore\r\n\r\nRiver and the Jurong Reservoir for industrial water\r\n\r\nis being negotiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, I would like to quote the figures of\r\n\r\ndaily  consumption  of water  in  1959  as  against\r\n\r\n1963: 1959,  64  million gallons per day;  1963,  73\r\n\r\nmillion gallons per day - an increase of some 15  per\r\n\r\ncent  in the short space of 3\ufffd years. Members  will\r\n\r\nrealise, therefore, the urgent necessity of getting\r\n\r\non  with  the  waterworks  to  ensure  that  supply\r\n\r\nremains greater than demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, too, with electricity. Plans have been\r\n\r\ncompleted  and orders placed for a 22,500  kilowatt\r\n\r\nadditional generating plant to be installed at  St.\r\n\r\nJames' Power Station comprising two 11,250 kilowatt\r\n\r\ngas  turbines meant primarily to increase operation\r\n\r\nover  the  peak  load  periods  and  scheduled  for\r\n\r\nproduction  in December this year. This  will  take\r\n\r\ncare  of  the interim increase in demand while  the\r\n\r\nsecond  power  station  at  Pasir  Panjang -   Power\r\n\r\nStation \"B\" of 60,000 kilowatts - is being installed\r\n\r\nto be ready by the first half of 1965.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all in all, we can look back with some\r\n\r\nsatisfaction on the progress that has been made  in\r\n\r\nthe past year. Despite all the obstacles placed  by\r\n\r\nCommunist   united-front  organisations   on   land\r\n\r\nclearance  and squatter resettlement, we have  been\r\n\r\nable to resettle on fair terms several thousands of\r\n\r\nsquatters.  Now  all the major projects  are  under\r\n\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of this year the earthworks for Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  would be completed and 50 acres of  building\r\n\r\nsite  will be available. The excess earth from  Toa\r\n\r\nPayoh  will  be  transported to  Kallang  Basin  to\r\n\r\nreclaim another 50 acres for industrial sites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to give Members some perspective of these\r\n\r\nfigures, may I mention that on the 50 acres of land\r\n\r\nat  Toa Payoh, an estimated 100,000 persons can  be\r\n\r\nresettled and the Toa Payoh scheme, when completed,\r\n\r\nwill  be able to house 350,000 people in a properly\r\n\r\nlaid out satellite town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also know that recently when\r\n\r\noperations  to clear the roads started, the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Toa  Payoh  aided and abetted,  or  perhaps  I\r\n\r\nshould say, he, aiding and abetting some Communist-front operators in Toa Payoh, tried to sabotage the\r\n\r\nmachines that were used in the operations. I  think\r\n\r\nthe Member\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Toa  Payoh  realises now the  gravity  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  If people are determined to  embark  on\r\n\r\nunlawful activities, then they must be prepared  to\r\n\r\ntake  the consequences and it is no use complaining\r\n\r\nabout  bad diets and bad rations. All these  things\r\n\r\nshould  have been carefully considered  before  one\r\n\r\nmounts    an    anti-the-people,    anti-the-nation\r\n\r\ncampaign.  Once  the battle has been  joined,  then\r\n\r\nthey   must   expect  it  to  go  to  its   logical\r\n\r\nconclusion. One cannot, Sir, run with the hare  and\r\n\r\nhunt with the hounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the demolition of the Outram Road Prison has\r\n\r\nalready begun and will be completed by the  end  of\r\n\r\nthis  year. This is a take-off for the main project\r\n\r\nof  urban  redevelopment which will begin with  the\r\n\r\nhelp  of a team of United Nations experts who  have\r\n\r\nbeen invited to Singapore to advise on central city\r\n\r\nredevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, all this would be impossible if\r\n\r\nthe  economic prosperity to pay for all  this  were\r\n\r\nnot  there.

You will notice, Sic,\r\n\r\nthat  in the speech of the Prime Minister, he talks\r\n\r\nof  nothing  but the number of standpipes  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  housing units - with a full list  of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of  housing units, the number of standpipes\r\n\r\nand  even the number of post offices with which the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. leaders  hope  to  impress  the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore with their ability, efficiency  and  good\r\n\r\nwork  as a government.

There is no mention of how  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  intends to help the people get  rid  of\r\n\r\nexploitation and oppression.

There is  no  mention  of  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  a  truly equal and just  society -  a\r\n\r\nsocialist society which the Prime Minister  boasted\r\n\r\nso  much  about  in the first year of  office.

But what has happened to  the\r\n\r\nCommon  Market?  Nothing, not a word  is  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout the Common Market. And, in fact, how many  of\r\n\r\nthe  unemployed masses have found employment, as  a\r\n\r\nresult of P.A.P. work after assuming power? Would the\r\n\r\nGovernment  tell us the actual number of unemployed\r\n\r\nin the State of Singapore and the actual number who\r\n\r\nhave  got jobs following development projects? They\r\n\r\nmay  have millions and millions of dollars  in  the\r\n\r\nkitty,  but  how does that help the  poor  and  the\r\n\r\nunemployed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is this frequent boasting of \"P.A.P.\r\n\r\ndynamic  effort\" which says that they  have  broken\r\n\r\nthe  back of the housing shortage. True, there  are\r\n\r\nmore  housing flats today than in 1959. Well,  what\r\n\r\nis  there  to  boast about? Is  that  not  part  or\r\n\r\nGovernment's duties and responsibilities? But  more\r\n\r\nto  the  point is this: how many housing units  are\r\n\r\nthere  that are mere \"standing monuments\"?  In  the\r\n\r\nwords     of     the    Prime    Minister - \"standing\r\n\r\nmonuments\" - due  to  the  inefficiency   of   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nplanning  or  rather  due to  the  lack  of  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nplanning.  Anyone can build any number  of  housing\r\n\r\nflats  as  long  as  he has money  to  do  so.  Any\r\n\r\ncontractor, any Housing Estate can do that;  we  do\r\n\r\nnot need a Government to do that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

That  is  a  very\r\n\r\nimportant  question.  Are we to  build  houses  and\r\n\r\nflats  just  for  the sake of building  houses  and\r\n\r\nfiats - a  matter of art for art's sake? Do we  build\r\n\r\nhouses  and  flats  without  consideration  as   to\r\n\r\nwhether  or  not the people can afford to  stay  in\r\n\r\nthem?  What  has  happened to the  P.A.P. election\r\n\r\npledge  to build low-cost housing for the  poor  in\r\n\r\nSingapore? Does the P.A.P. Government not know that\r\n\r\nthe  majority of the people in Singapore  are  poor\r\n\r\nand  cannot  afford  high-cost  housing?  Yes,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. has  built  a  number of  low-cost  housing\r\n\r\nunits.  But  that is not enough, far  from  enough!\r\n\r\nThere are too\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfew  of  these low-cost housing flats. Most of  the\r\n\r\nhousing  units built are beyond the  reach  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary worker and many people just cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  stay  in the Housing Board flats built  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, and especially so when these flats  are\r\n\r\nbuilt  far  away from the centres of  communication\r\n\r\nand  far  away from schooling facilities for  their\r\n\r\nchildren  and  from  their places  of  work.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult, though thousands of flats have been  built,\r\n\r\nthousands  also  are unoccupied, in  spite  of  all\r\n\r\ntypes  of  offers and inducements by the Government\r\n\r\nto  get  the people to live in them. To all intents\r\n\r\nand  purposes, these empty housing units  are  mere\r\n\r\n\"white  elephants\". Many of these flats go abegging\r\n\r\nand no one wants to stay in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should this be so when there are slums all\r\n\r\nover  Singapore  and when people have  to  live  in\r\n\r\ninsanitary  attap huts and in the kampongs?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the people want to live in attap huts  and\r\n\r\nkampongs?  The  Prime Minister in the  U.N.E.S.C.O.\r\n\r\nOpening in Singapore a couple of months back  said,\r\n\r\n\"Yes\".  He said the Malays prefer to live in wooden\r\n\r\nhouses   on  stilts.  He  said  this  is   due   to\r\n\r\npsychological   reasons:  that   the   Malays   are\r\n\r\nsatisfied  with kampong life and that  they  cannot\r\n\r\nadjust themselves to living in Housing Board flats.\r\n\r\nThese  are the reasons given by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, in a country that is undeveloped and\r\n\r\nin  a  country where all the people are  poor!  For\r\n\r\nexample, does the Prime Minister know that many, in\r\n\r\nfact,  almost all the kampong folks, cannot  afford\r\n\r\nto  live in the Housing Board flats, and that  they\r\n\r\nlive  in  kampongs  because economically  they  are\r\n\r\nbound    to   the   kampongs   and   not    because\r\n\r\npsychologically they like to stay in kampongs? Give\r\n\r\nthem the money, give them the wherewithal, and  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister will see that the kampong folks  are\r\n\r\nready to live in the most beautiful and the best of\r\n\r\nhouses; that they will be able to adjust themselves\r\n\r\nas well as anyone can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Their shameless scare  propaganda\r\n\r\nduring  the  last  week of the referendum  campaign\r\n\r\ndepended  greatly  on  the radio  and  Rediffusion,\r\n\r\nassisted by the Press and police vans to carry  the\r\n\r\nthreats  and  intimidation of  the  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nabout  the los3 of citizenship, if the people  cast\r\n\r\nblank  votes,  into  the homes  of  the  people  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  That is why the rural areas  which  are\r\n\r\nnot  so  well  served with radios  and  Rediffusion\r\n\r\nreturned  a higher percentage of blank votes.  This\r\n\r\nhas been admitted as much by the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the P.A.P. wants to build hundreds and\r\n\r\nhundreds  of  community centres in the rural  areas\r\n\r\nand  install in them radio and television sets, all\r\n\r\nwith the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhope   of   soaking   the  audience   with   P.A.P.\r\n\r\npropaganda,  because television is  a  novelty  and\r\n\r\nmany  people will go to community centres to  watch\r\n\r\ntelevision  out  of curiosity.  The  P.A.P. is  so\r\n\r\nanxious for everyone to come under the influence of\r\n\r\nits  propaganda that the Permanent Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Culture had to write letters to coffee-shop  owners - under  instructions  from  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters  no  doubt - to  request  them  to  install\r\n\r\ntelevision sets in their premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times, on 29th March, 1963, reported\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore  Government  had  launched   a\r\n\r\ncampaign  to  get  T.V. sets  installed  in  bars,\r\n\r\nrestaurants  and coffee-shops. Letters,  signed  by\r\n\r\nMr W. S. Woon, Permanent Secretary to the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Culture,  had  gone out  to  owners  of  those\r\n\r\nestablishments.

To the P.A.P., of course, T.V. is going to  be\r\n\r\ntheir  life-line. Not being able to get  a  sizable\r\n\r\naudience  in mass rallies, the P.A.P. hopes  to  be\r\n\r\nable to reach tens of thousands in their homes. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. hopes to compel the people, willy-nilly, to\r\n\r\nlisten to speeches and party propaganda from P.A.P.\r\n\r\nMinisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the P.A.P. not misuse public money for its own\r\n\r\nparty propaganda. The P.A.P. has pledged to husband\r\n\r\nall  available resources to help raise  the  living\r\n\r\nstandards  of  the people and not to  fritter  away\r\n\r\nmoney   for  the  promotion  of  private  sectional\r\n\r\ninterests and of their colonial masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, sir, let me refer once again to the\r\n\r\nboast  of the P.A.P. about the increase in  revenue\r\n\r\nand   accounts.  May  I  refer  you,  Sir,  to  the\r\n\r\nFinancial Statement for the year 1959? On page\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n44,  in  the  last column, you will  see  that  the\r\n\r\nsurplus funds, market value on 31st December,  1959\r\n\r\namounted  to $93,524,577.46. We will just  call  it\r\n\r\n$93  million. Let us turn to page 48  of  the  same\r\n\r\nFinancial Statement for the year 1959. We see  that\r\n\r\nthe  net  value  in  Dollars  of  Development  Fund\r\n\r\nInvestments  is  equal  to $46,124,666.90.  Let  us\r\n\r\nbriefly  call it $46 million. $93 million plus  $46\r\n\r\nmillion equal $139 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now may I refer you to the 1960 Financial\r\n\r\nStatement,  and draw your attention to  the  figure\r\n\r\nthat  is printed in page 45? Against Surplus Funds,\r\n\r\non    31st   December,   1960,   the   figure    is\r\n\r\n$164,004,002.18.  Let us call it $164  million.  If\r\n\r\nyou   turn   to  page  49,  the  Development   Fund\r\n\r\nInvestments  on  31st December,  1960  amounted  to\r\n\r\n$85,148,387.36. Let us call it $85 million.  If  we\r\n\r\nadd  $164 million to $85 million, we get the figure\r\n\r\nof  $249 million. We see, Sir, therefore, that from\r\n\r\n1959  to  1960 the amount that was invested  abroad\r\n\r\nhas  increased from $139 million to $249  million - a\r\n\r\ndifference of $110 million. Let me now refer to the\r\n\r\nFinancial Statement for the year 1961. On page 210,\r\n\r\nin  the  last column, you get the Surplus Funds  on\r\n\r\n31st December, 1961. The figure is $199,119,196.29.\r\n\r\nYou see, Sir, these investments have - I do not think\r\n\r\nI need run through all of them - all been invested in\r\n\r\nAberdeen   Corporation,  Australia,  British   Gas,\r\n\r\nHuddersfield  Hull,  etc, which  are  all  foreign\r\n\r\nfirms.  The  next figure to which I would  like  to\r\n\r\ndraw your attention is on page 215, which tells  us\r\n\r\nof   the   particulars  of  the  Development   Fund\r\n\r\nInvestments on 31st December, 1961. The  figure  is\r\n\r\n$117,019,572.83. If we were to add the $199 million\r\n\r\nof  the  Surplus Funds to the $117 million  of  the\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund Investments, we get the figure  of\r\n\r\n$316 million. Sir, all this money has been invested\r\n\r\nnot in Singapore, but in some foreign lands to help\r\n\r\nother people and not the people of Singapore.  That\r\n\r\nmoney  has been used to help the colonial interests\r\n\r\nand not the people of Singapore. From 1959 to 1961.\r\n\r\nwe   see  that  the  amount  invested  abroad   has\r\n\r\nincreased from $139 million to $249 million to $316\r\n\r\nmillion. Every year it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  been  increasing, and yet the P.A.P.  wants  to\r\n\r\nboast that there is so much and so much and so much\r\n\r\nin the kitty. As I have already asked, Sir, what is\r\n\r\nthe  point of having so much in the kitty  and  not\r\n\r\nmaking  use  of  the money for the welfare  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore?  There  are  millions   and\r\n\r\nmillions  of  dollars, as we know,  in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates  and elsewhere, but what good is that  money\r\n\r\nto us? I wish the Minister for Finance will explain\r\n\r\nall  this  to us. We are very dense in  matters  of\r\n\r\nfinance,  but  probably the Minister will  care  to\r\n\r\nenlighten the people of Singapore as to why so much\r\n\r\nof our money has been invested abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the hospital services. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask, what provisions have the  Government\r\n\r\nmade  for the increasing number of patients who  go\r\n\r\nto  hospital  for treatment? There are  reports  of\r\n\r\nshortages  of all sorts of medicines and  materials\r\n\r\nfor  the use of patients. Why should, I ask,  there\r\n\r\nbe  shortages? Is it because we do not have  enough\r\n\r\nmoney  to  look  after  the  sick?  I  have   just\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\ninvested abroad. When the Government claims to have\r\n\r\nmillions of dollars in the kitty, and when millions\r\n\r\nof  dollars  has to be spent on advertisements  for\r\n\r\nthe  promotion of Malaysia and T.V., why should the\r\n\r\nhospitals   run  short  of  medicines   and   other\r\n\r\nmaterials needed to look after the sick? And why do\r\n\r\noutpatients   in  the  Government   Polyclinic   in\r\n\r\nQueenstown  have  to  pay  50  cents  per  patient?\r\n\r\nPatients  get free treatment in other  clinics  Why\r\n\r\nshould   it  be  different  in  the  case  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment Polyclinic in Queenstown? Is it a change\r\n\r\nof policy, or is it pure discrimination?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding education, the Government can never\r\n\r\nagain claim that there is equal treatment for  four\r\n\r\nstreams  of education in Singapore. We do not  know\r\n\r\nhow  much  connection  there is  between  the  mass\r\n\r\narrests on 2nd February and the `Torch Campaign' to\r\n\r\nencourage parents and schoolchildren to pay serious\r\n\r\nattention  to the study of their mother tongue  and\r\n\r\nlanguage. But the P.A.P. education policy has  been\r\n\r\nshown  to  be  discriminatory.  For  instance,  the\r\n\r\nquestion of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNantah   University   has  until   today   remained\r\n\r\nunsettled.  The  number  of  students  joining  the\r\n\r\nMalay, Chinese and primary school classes for  1963\r\n\r\nhas  dropped  very steeply in comparison  with  the\r\n\r\nnumber of students attending primary classes in the\r\n\r\nEnglish stream. If we compare the number of primary\r\n\r\nstudents for the various streams in 1963 with  that\r\n\r\nof  previous  years, there is a shocking  contrast.\r\n\r\nThis  alone is enough to show how successful  PA.P.\r\n\r\npolicy  has  been  in  its  discrimination  against\r\n\r\nMalay, Chinese and Tamil education. Indeed, Sir, so\r\n\r\nscared  is  the  P.A.P. of the people  knowing  the\r\n\r\nactual  situation that the Permanent  Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister for Education has to clam up and  not\r\n\r\nanswer  enquiries  in several letters  from  me.  I\r\n\r\nenquired for the figures of primary students in the\r\n\r\nvarious  streams of education for 1963, as well  as\r\n\r\nfor the previous years, in my capacity as Member of\r\n\r\nthe  Legislative Assembly for Queenstown, but there\r\n\r\nwas not even a letter of acknowledgement to all  my\r\n\r\nletters.  Let the Government take serious  note  of\r\n\r\nthis discourtesy on the part of civil servants, and\r\n\r\ntake   appropriate  disciplinary   action   against\r\n\r\nwhoever is responsible. [Laughter] The Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  laughs,  but  let the  P.A.P. remember  its\r\n\r\nelection pledge to run a courteous civil service in\r\n\r\n1959.  What has happened? Are civil servants to  be\r\n\r\ndiscourteous   to  the  people  by  not   answering\r\n\r\nenquiries from the public and from Members  of  the\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to touch at length on many of\r\n\r\nthe other subjects. I shall lease most of the other\r\n\r\nsubjects  to my other colleagues. They are subjects\r\n\r\nlike  the pro-colonial policies of the P.A.P. which\r\n\r\nwill  be the subject of another motion standing  in\r\n\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Legislative Assembly have had an\r\n\r\nenforced  long  vacation and, but for  the  popular\r\n\r\npressure - in  spite of what the Prime  Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid - for the recall of the Legislative  Assembly,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. would have given us a longer  enforced\r\n\r\nvacation.  An  air of uncertainty is ever  present,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  more so today than yesterday,  because\r\n\r\nrepression\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  come,  and  there may be more  repressions  to\r\n\r\ncome. The P.A.P. says that there will not be an air\r\n\r\nof  excitement and uncertainty, but on the contrary\r\n\r\nI say that the air is full of uncertainty, and that\r\n\r\nthis   uncertainty   increases   with   the   daily\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the international situation.  It  is\r\n\r\nso  uncertain,  in fact, that millions  of  dollars\r\n\r\nhave  gone  to  Hongkong  already.  This  has  been\r\n\r\nreported in Newsweek and in the Straits' Times. How\r\n\r\ncan such uncertainty give rise to any confidence in\r\n\r\nthe  people, as is mentioned in the Yang di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara's speech? In column 4 of Hansard dated  27th\r\n\r\nMarch,  1963, it says, \"All is calm and  tranquil.\"\r\n\r\nObviously then, Sir, there was no justification for\r\n\r\nthe  recent  mass arrests. That the P.A.P. had  to\r\n\r\nresort  to  arrests clearly shows  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\ncannot  compete with the Barisan Sosialis  for  the\r\n\r\nsupport of the people. The P.A.P. has failed in the\r\n\r\nopen argument, and has not, as is alleged in column\r\n\r\n5, won the open argument. If there was seven months\r\n\r\nof peace and tranquility, as is mentioned in column\r\n\r\n5,  and yet there were arrests two months ago, then\r\n\r\nit clearly exposes the deceit and Fascist nature of\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  The sham referendum on 1st  September,\r\n\r\n1962,  merely exposed the deceit of the P.A.P. yet\r\n\r\nfurther.  The  colonialists and their PAP, stooges\r\n\r\nhave  made  use  of the false result  of  the  sham\r\n\r\nreferendum  to  deceive the world  about  the  true\r\n\r\nsituation  in  Singapore.  And  similarly  has  the\r\n\r\nInternal  Security Council made use of  this  false\r\n\r\nresult  as  an  excuse and pretext  for  repressive\r\n\r\naction against uncompromising anti-colonialists and\r\n\r\nanti-imperialists,   and  against   all   prominent\r\n\r\nleaders who oppose Malaysia and the P.A.P. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  talks of the verdict of the  people.  But\r\n\r\nlet us see how the verdict was obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Sir, the referendum was carried\r\n\r\nout merely as a facade of democracy and of allowing\r\n\r\nthe  people  a  choice of alternatives  offered  to\r\n\r\nthem.  But  you will remember also. Sir,  that  the\r\n\r\npeople  were not allowed to say no, and  they  must\r\n\r\nchoose  one  of the three alternatives. And  voting\r\n\r\nbeing compulsory, the people\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhad no way out, no means of abstention. Tearing  up\r\n\r\nof  the  paper  would have meant imprisonment,  and\r\n\r\nputting in a blank paper would also have meant  the\r\n\r\nblank  paper  being considered as a  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  Of  course, all this was  because  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.'s  intention was to coerce the  people  into\r\n\r\nchoosing the P.A.P. proposals and never to  give  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  those  people who  opposed  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nmerger proposals. You will remember also, Sir, that\r\n\r\nwe  in  the Opposition had called on the people  to\r\n\r\ncast  blank  votes in protest, and as the  campaign\r\n\r\nproceeded,   it  became  obvious  from   the   huge\r\n\r\nattendances   at   Opposition  parties   referendum\r\n\r\nrallies and the empty attendances at the Government\r\n\r\nParty  rallies that the vast majority of the people\r\n\r\nwould  cast  blank  votes in  protest  against  the\r\n\r\nundemocratic  and  dishonest referendum.  Then  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Government, knowing that they would fail and\r\n\r\nwould  morally lose at least, came out with  a  new\r\n\r\ngimmick.  They  stated that blank votes  would  not\r\n\r\nnecessarily mean Government votes, but  could  mean\r\n\r\nthe  loss of citizenship for more than half of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore. Big headlines, Sir,  screamed\r\n\r\n\"Blank  votes mean loss of citizenship\". The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister made a speech in Fullerton Square  and  it\r\n\r\nwas  broadcast and re-broadcast over  Radio  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nand  Rediffusion  four  or  five  times.  Moreover,\r\n\r\nrumours  were started by the P.A.P. that  the  vote\r\n\r\nwas not secret because of the number on the back of\r\n\r\nthe  ballot paper, and discovery of those who  cast\r\n\r\nblank  votes would mean loss of citizenship rights,\r\n\r\nlike loss of jobs, 1icences, passports, housing and\r\n\r\nschooling  facilities, welfare aid and  other  such\r\n\r\nlike dire consequences. Finally, to cap it all,  on\r\n\r\nPolling Day voters were directed by supervisors  of\r\n\r\npolling  stations  specifically  to  put  a   cross\r\n\r\nagainst  one of the three alternatives. The  voters\r\n\r\nwere  told that they must cast votes with  a  cross\r\n\r\nand not cast blank votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, Sir, the result of the\r\n\r\nreferendum was a foregone conclusion. Nevertheless,\r\n\r\ndespite all this, 25 per cent came out courageously\r\n\r\nin  the  face of Government intimidation  and  cast\r\n\r\nblank  votes. Later many who had been coerced  into\r\n\r\nputting in votes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  Alternative  A came to tell us  of  the  split\r\n\r\nvoting in families. Parents had to vote Alternative\r\n\r\nA  and sons and daughters voted blank. Husbands had\r\n\r\nvoted  A  and  wives had voted blank. This  was  to\r\n\r\ninsure  against the Government really carrying  out\r\n\r\nits   threats.  Thus,  if  one  was   deprived   of\r\n\r\ncitizenship rights as a result of casting  a  blank\r\n\r\nvote, the other member of the family would be  able\r\n\r\nto  say that he or she had voted for A and so would\r\n\r\nstill  be able to claim facilities that could  only\r\n\r\nbe  claimed by citizens. The result of 70 per  cent\r\n\r\nfor Alternative A, therefore, did not truly reflect\r\n\r\nthe will of the people of Singapore. They voted for\r\n\r\nA  not  because  they wanted A,  but  because  they\r\n\r\nfeared  B. And thus the P.A.P. Government  achieved\r\n\r\nits  purpose through the undemocratic and dishonest\r\n\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Two  referendum\r\n\r\nsurveys  were  carried  out - one  was  in  Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar.  We  had  referred to that earlier.  In  the\r\n\r\nreferendum  survey of Tanjong Pagar,  one  straight\r\n\r\nquestion  was posed to the people. They were  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  they would accept or reject the Government\r\n\r\nWhite  Paper merger proposals. All they were  asked\r\n\r\nto  do  was  to say yes or no. And the result  came\r\n\r\nback,  90 per cent no, 6 per cent yes, and a 2  per\r\n\r\ncent  here and a 2 per cent there. That was in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of  Tanjong  Pagar, the constituency  of  the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  himself. But I do not  think  this\r\n\r\nHouse  has  a  record of the results of  the  other\r\n\r\nsurvey  referendum  that was  carried  out  in  the\r\n\r\nconstituency of Kreta Ayer, the constituency of the\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister.  In that referendum  survey  the\r\n\r\nquestions posed were exactly as those posed by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment on Referendum Day. That is to say, three\r\n\r\nquestions were posed to them - A, B and C.  And  this\r\n\r\nis  the  result  of  that survey carried  out  just\r\n\r\nbefore the referendum in 1962. Those who voted  for\r\n\r\nAlternative A, that is, the White Paper  proposals,\r\n\r\n106  votes,  and  it works out to  1.26  per  cent.\r\n\r\nAlternative B, 93 votes, 1.10 per cent. Alternative\r\n\r\nC, 16 votes, and it works out to 0.19 per cent. The\r\n\r\nblanks 8,186 votes, and that works out to 97.13 per\r\n\r\ncent.  Spoilt votes, 27, and it works out to  0.32\r\n\r\nper  cent.  The  total number of votes  was  8,428.

The\r\n\r\nmajority  opinion  of the people in  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nnever   been   truly  ascertained   in   the   sham\r\n\r\nreferendum, and we urge the Government to ascertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonestly  the  views of the people of Singapore  on\r\n\r\ntheir constitutional future in accordance with  the\r\n\r\nUnited Nations Resolutions 1514 and 1541.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of the various efforts of the\r\n\r\ncolonial power to form pro-Malaysia parties in  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  and now  even  a  pro-Malaysia\r\n\r\nGrand  Alliance, it is clear that the  majority  of\r\n\r\nthe  people  do not want Malaysia. In Sarawak,  the\r\n\r\nSarawak  United  People's Party  is  still  solidly\r\n\r\nagainst  Malaysia in spite of the arrests  and  the\r\n\r\nattempts  to  brand the Party as a  Communist-front\r\n\r\norganisation.   In   Brunei,   the   intensity   of\r\n\r\nopposition to Malaysia has already resulted in open\r\n\r\nrevolt and guerilla warfare. Only in Sabah can they\r\n\r\nclaim  some support for Malaysia, and this is  more\r\n\r\napparent  than real. The people in Sabah have  been\r\n\r\nintimidated  by communal fears into  voicing  their\r\n\r\nsupport  for  Malaysia following  the  Philippines'\r\n\r\nclaim to Sabah and the uprising in Brunei. Even  in\r\n\r\nthe Federation itself, Sir, there is today a united\r\n\r\nopposition  to  Malaysia, comprising all  political\r\n\r\nParties in the Opposition. I mention all this  only\r\n\r\nin  passing to show that, in truth and in fact, the\r\n\r\nmajority of the people oppose Malaysia not only  in\r\n\r\nthe  Borneo territories, but also in Malaya itself.\r\n\r\nThe  powers-that-be can easily ascertain the  views\r\n\r\nof  the  people. The Borneo territories have  asked\r\n\r\nfor  a plebiscite, and neutral bodies, like Malayan\r\n\r\nstudent   bodies  in  the  United   Kingdom,   have\r\n\r\nsimilarly  asked  for a plebiscite,  to  truthfully\r\n\r\nascertain the views of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In column six of the Hansard of 27th March, 1963,\r\n\r\nSir,  it says that the Afro-Asian nations have  now\r\n\r\nunderstood what Malaysia is all about. I can assure\r\n\r\nyou,  Sir, since my recent trip to London,  all  or\r\n\r\nmost of the Afro-Asian nations know the true nature\r\n\r\nof  Malaysia.  Previously colonial and  P.A.P. and\r\n\r\nFederation  propaganda has been telling  the  world\r\n\r\nthat  there is very little opposition to  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthat  the  majority of the people are for Malaysia.\r\n\r\nWhen  I  showed them pictures of rallies  that  had\r\n\r\nsupported  us, they were simply shocked.

It\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The 3rd Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference\r\n\r\nmeeting  in Tanganyika Town of Moshi from  February\r\n\r\n4th  to  11th, 1963, fervently greets the delegates\r\n\r\nof  fighting North Kalimantan people and  expresses\r\n\r\nfull  support  for the just struggle of  the  North\r\n\r\nKalimantan  people  against  the  neo-colonialists.\r\n\r\nThis  Conference appeals to Afro-Asian  governments\r\n\r\nand peoples in general to render their full support\r\n\r\nto  the  struggle of the people of North Kalimantan\r\n\r\nagainst   any   federation  which  is   now   being\r\n\r\nintensively  imposed  by the  imperialists  in  co-operation  with their agents and to  recognise  the\r\n\r\nnewly proclaimed full independence of the people of\r\n\r\nNorth Kalimantan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more paragraph, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We appeal to and urge all freedom-loving peoples\r\n\r\nof  the  world to take definite measures to  oppose\r\n\r\nthe  reactionary actions of the British  Government\r\n\r\nin  sending  armed troops to fight and repress  the\r\n\r\nstruggle  for  full independence of the  people  of\r\n\r\nNorth Kalimantan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, is one of the resolutions in Moshi,\r\n\r\nwhere the P.A.P. tried, so unsuccessfully, to gate-crash into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

Malaysia is  a  British\r\n\r\nplot  to  prolong colonial domination in South-East\r\n\r\nAsia. Malaysia is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  the  political aspect of the British Military\r\n\r\nFar  East Unified Command, which covers exactly the\r\n\r\nsame five territories. It is, in fact, an extension\r\n\r\nof  the  working  room of SEATO,  and  consequently\r\n\r\nMalaysia is opposed by Indonesia and the other Afro-Asian  nations.  The only way to  restore  friendly\r\n\r\nrelations with Indonesia, and also the Philippines,\r\n\r\nand  to  maintain peace and security in  South-East\r\n\r\nAsia is to scrap Malaysia, abandon Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we know that this is not within the\r\n\r\npower  of the P.A.P.

The  Borneo territories  are  separated\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaya by 300 miles of sea. The eastern  part\r\n\r\nof  Sabah  is  more than 1,000 miles  from  Malaya.\r\n\r\nApart  from  British colonial rule, therefore,  the\r\n\r\nBorneo  territories  have  little  in  common  with\r\n\r\nMalaya.  Their  natural links-if we  must  talk  of\r\n\r\nlinks-are  more  with Indonesia.  And  as  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore, our demand, ever since  1948,\r\n\r\nwhen  Britain separated us from the rest of Malaya,\r\n\r\nhas  been for re-unification. But unfortunately the\r\n\r\npresent  White Paper merger proposals and  Malaysia\r\n\r\ndo  not give us a brotherly reunion. They are meant\r\n\r\nto  accentuate differences, and may even create new\r\n\r\nones,  amongst us and amongst the various  communal\r\n\r\ncomponents of our country. They are meant to  delay\r\n\r\nstill  further the re-unification of Singapore  and\r\n\r\nthe Federation into a genuine Malayan nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already colonial repression has taken place as a\r\n\r\nresult  of the Malaysian Plan.

I do not have to\r\n\r\nrepeat  again the arguments which completely expose\r\n\r\nthe  false propaganda claim of \"prosperity  through\r\n\r\nMalaysia\", \"Independence through Malaysia\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kee Hui, Chairman of the Sarawak United People's Party, and one-time member of the Malaysia Solidarity Consultative Committee, and a one-time active supporter of Malaysia, today calls the slogan of \"Independence through Malaysia\" a myth.

They will then\r\n\r\nsee  through  the falsity of P.A.P. propaganda  and\r\n\r\ncurse the P.A.P. for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as a result of party interests having been\r\n\r\ninvolved,  the P.A.P. leaders already realise  that\r\n\r\nthey  have  sold Singapore to the Federation  lock,\r\n\r\nstock and barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall Federation financial control will limit\r\n\r\nand  restrict Singapore's development, both of  new\r\n\r\nenterprises and of expanding recurrent expenditures\r\n\r\nof  the Government. The Prime Minister has admitted\r\n\r\nas  much.  There is no promise of a Common  Market,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is already a call for extra burdens  by\r\n\r\nthe powers that be in the Federation. This call can\r\n\r\nonly  mean  ultimate  extra burdens  also  for  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore. As more and more expenditure\r\n\r\nis used on the armed forces, this extra burden will\r\n\r\nbecome  more  and  more  extra.

This is  not\r\n\r\ntrue-completely not true. A great issue divides the\r\n\r\npeople. There is no greater issue that divides  the\r\n\r\npeople  today than the issue of Malaysia.

I would suggest that the Ministers\r\n\r\ngive  the  Member for Queenstown an opportunity  of\r\n\r\nsaying what he wishes to say without interruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Thank you, Sir,I was saying,\r\n\r\nwith  such a division of the people, national unity\r\n\r\nis  not  possible. Moreover, the sense  of  oneness\r\n\r\ndisappears  when barriers are erected  between  the\r\n\r\nvarious territories to limit freedom of travel  and\r\n\r\nto   prevent  so-called  Malaysian  citizens   from\r\n\r\nparticipating fully in the political  life  of  the\r\n\r\nnation  as a whole. Instead, there is today  mutual\r\n\r\nsuspicion,  mutual  fear and  even  hatred.  Should\r\n\r\nBritain  so unwisely still impose Malaysia  on  the\r\n\r\npeople against their will it can only last so  long\r\n\r\nas  there are British bayonets and jets around. But\r\n\r\nthis  will mean a heavy price in blood and material\r\n\r\nfor all concerned. I ask the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Ministers,  \"Is  this  necessary:  is  this\r\n\r\nwise?\".  The failure of the Federation  of  Central\r\n\r\nAfrica clearly shows us that without the support of\r\n\r\nthe   majority  of  the  people,  Malaysia   cannot\r\n\r\nsucceed: it must fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is great talk of Communism in the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's  speech. It is a talk which  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nhas  always been interested in. I think I might  as\r\n\r\nwell  leave this subject to the motion for the mass\r\n\r\narrests  when  the  question of Communism  will  be\r\n\r\nfully  discussed. But I say, with all  the  ominous\r\n\r\ndanger signals before us, let the P.A.P. not  drift\r\n\r\nstill  further  away from the straight  and  narrow\r\n\r\npath   of  service  to  the  people.  The  national\r\n\r\ninterests of the people must come before Party  and\r\n\r\npersonal   interests  and  before  foreign   vested\r\n\r\ninterests. The people of Singapore have  no  vested\r\n\r\ninterests  in Malaysia. It is the British  Imperial\r\n\r\nChief-of-Stall  and the Forces he  represents  that\r\n\r\nhave  vested  interests in Malaysia.  General  Hull\r\n\r\npublicly stated that Britain is 500 per cent behind\r\n\r\nMalaysia.  This alone shows whose vested  interests\r\n\r\nare involved in Malaysia - definitely not the vested\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore.  The  vested\r\n\r\ninterests  of the people of Singapore  lie  in  the\r\n\r\nreunification,  as I have said, of  the  Federation\r\n\r\nand   Singapore   into   a  genuinely   democratic,\r\n\r\nindependent Malaya, free of foreign troops and free\r\n\r\nof  foreign control. All of us in Malaya, that  is,\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  and the Federation, irrespective  of\r\n\r\nrace,  colour or creed, are members of one  family.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before finally committing the  fate  and\r\n\r\ndestiny  of  1.7  million people  to  the  British-sponsored  Malaysian  Plan, let  the  P.A.P. first\r\n\r\npause  and  genuinely  and honestly  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nviews of the people on their constitutional future.\r\n\r\nBetter  still, let the House demand that the United\r\n\r\nKingdom  Government abandon the Malaysian Plan  and\r\n\r\nproposed transfer of sovereignty over Singapore  to\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  as  part of  that  Plan.  Let  all\r\n\r\npolitical     detainees    be     forthwith     and\r\n\r\nunconditionally released and let this  be  followed\r\n\r\nby   general   elections   fairly   conducted   and\r\n\r\nsupervised not by the P.A.P. ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

If  the\r\n\r\nlast  door to constitutional struggle is closed  to\r\n\r\nthe  people,  then there can remain but  one  final\r\n\r\nanswer.

Member wishing to speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dato Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, we Members of this\r\n\r\nAssembly, over the past six months, have not had  a\r\n\r\nchance  to  debate  like  players  playing   in   a\r\n\r\nbadminton or a golf game. Similarly, it is with  my\r\n\r\ncase,  because of lack of practice it  is  possible\r\n\r\nthat  I  am  a  bit  rusty today.  However,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion,  to quote from the speech of the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara, the most important thing which  we\r\n\r\nare  faced  with at the present moment is  not  the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  how many houses and how  many  stand-pipes have been put up or roads built, but the most\r\n\r\nvital  thing is the problem of Malaysia. If it  was\r\n\r\nimportant last year, it is even more important this\r\n\r\nyear  because  at the latest, by the  31st  August,\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will  be  formed. However  much,  however\r\n\r\nbitter, the opposition by political Parties in this\r\n\r\ncountry, particularly from the Barisan Sosialis and\r\n\r\nits   colleagues  in  the  united  front  Communist\r\n\r\norganisations.  I am confident that  Malaysia  will\r\n\r\npositively be formed. At the same time,  a  feeling\r\n\r\nof  regret has emerged, not only from my Party  but\r\n\r\nfrom  all  the  people of Singapore, after  hearing\r\n\r\nspeeches  from  the Government over  the  past  few\r\n\r\nmonths   which   have   created   a   feeling    of\r\n\r\nprovincialism towards Singapore. Such  speeches.  I\r\n\r\nthink,   should  not  have  been  uttered  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  because if we are really keen  to  see\r\n\r\nMalaysia come into being at\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  moment,  we should avoid such  sentiments  of\r\n\r\nprovincialism because it Will create  an  unhealthy\r\n\r\natmosphere  and  may  lead to a  chaotic  state  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. I do not know the reasons why the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has uttered such a note, but I am sure  he\r\n\r\nmust  have reasonable grounds for doing so.  On  my\r\n\r\npart, however, I feel that questions of eggs, ducks\r\n\r\nand  poultry  and  so  on do not  affect  Singapore\r\n\r\nalone, because in the future Malaysia, what happens\r\n\r\nin Singapore will be the responsibility of not only\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore  Government  but  also  the  future\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Government. If the people  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nface  hardships, or the people of Brunei  or  North\r\n\r\nBorneo  face  similar hardships, that problem  will\r\n\r\nnot only be borne by the respective Governments but\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  the  common responsibility  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Government.  And we  should  assist  every\r\n\r\ncitizen  in  that particular territory to  overcome\r\n\r\nhis difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the speeches made by the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  which  I have read in the newspapers,  to\r\n\r\nthe effect that because the stand of the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  is correct, therefore  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndispute between the Government of Singapore and the\r\n\r\nRepublic of Indonesia, bring no good at all  except\r\n\r\nto  widen the gap between the position of Singapore\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis  the Federation Government. I go  to  the\r\n\r\nFederation frequently and I mix not only with their\r\n\r\nleaders but also with the people of the Federation.\r\n\r\nThe  people there doubt the stand of the Government\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. I would like to advise the Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment,   when  making  speeches  relating   to\r\n\r\nMalaysia or to any aspect of the administration  of\r\n\r\nthe Singapore Government not to make speeches which\r\n\r\nwill  lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction not only\r\n\r\nfrom  the  people of Singapore but  also  from  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  the  territories  which  will  comprise\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech I was pleased to hear that the financial position of the Government today is healthy to the extent that it has a surplus of millions of dollars, which is all for the good of the State. Therefore, I wish to appeal to the Government, just as I had made a similar appeal last year, to\r\n\r\nreconsider\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  question of the arbitrary cuts in C.O.L.A. of\r\n\r\nGovernment servants which was carried out in  1959.\r\n\r\nAlthough   the  Government  has  made   a   partial\r\n\r\nrestoration in the allowances, in my opinion, there\r\n\r\nshould be a full restoration. If the P.A.P. and its\r\n\r\nleaders, especially the Parliamentary Secretary  to\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Culture who is also the leader  of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  unions, are brave enough to  fight  for\r\n\r\nincreased wages and better conditions of  work  for\r\n\r\nworkers,   then   it  follows  that   it   is   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of the Government to look after  its\r\n\r\nown  public  servants.  I appeal  because,  in  the\r\n\r\nspeech of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nmention  is made of the financial position  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  of  Singapore which  is  in  a  healthy\r\n\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, concerning education, I wish\r\n\r\nto  draw  the  attention of the Government  to  the\r\n\r\nsubject of textbooks. Each year at the beginning of\r\n\r\nthe  school  session parents are  unhappy  because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  they  find it difficult to buy  textbooks\r\n\r\nfor  their children; but the most important is  the\r\n\r\nchange of the textbooks. If a pupil this year is in\r\n\r\nForm 3, the books which he uses this year cannot be\r\n\r\nused the following year in the same form. New books\r\n\r\nwill  be used. This not only applies to one  school\r\n\r\nbut to all schools throughout Singapore. Therefore,\r\n\r\nit  means that every year textbooks are changed. If\r\n\r\nin Form 3 a white-cover book is used, for instance,\r\n\r\nnext  year  Form  3 will use a book  with  a  black\r\n\r\ncover.  This  is cause for concern to parents  from\r\n\r\nthe  financial point of view, especially those with\r\n\r\na large number of dependants to support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker, concerns housing.\r\n\r\nAlthough Government has erected thousands of houses\r\n\r\nand  such houses are beautiful, there exists a more\r\n\r\nimportant   and  urgent  problem  which  Government\r\n\r\nshould  give  attention to and that  is  the  lands\r\n\r\nbelonging  to landowners in Singapore for  building\r\n\r\nhouses for sale. The position in Singapore is  that\r\n\r\nlandowners  prefer  to build multi-storeyed  flats,\r\n\r\nand  they will make huge profits out of such flats,\r\n\r\nso  that the result is that the squatters will have\r\n\r\nto be evicted and these squatters face difficulties\r\n\r\nand they have no place to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nput  up  their  grievance.  This  has  happened  in\r\n\r\nKampong  Amber where a landowner is about to  build\r\n\r\nflats  and  the squatters there have to be  evicted\r\n\r\nand  they have no alternative accommodation. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government  will have them all  assistance  by\r\n\r\nwhatever  means. If I might be permitted to  put  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion  to the Government, I suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment set up a Re-housing Board just  as  they\r\n\r\nhave  set up a Rent Conciliation Board, where  such\r\n\r\nmatters  can  be  thrashed out and that  board  can\r\n\r\nbecome the third party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important matter, Mr Speaker. Just now I\r\n\r\nwas dwelling on general matters and not on specific\r\n\r\nmatters. Now I would like to deal with the position\r\n\r\nof   the  Malays  in  Singapore  and  I  hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will give serious consideration  to  my\r\n\r\nspeech.    Mr   Speaker,   Singapore   has    been\r\n\r\nadministered according to the Constitution which we\r\n\r\napproved  in  1958  where there is  enunciated  the\r\n\r\nspecial   position  of  the  Malays  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it is contained in the Preamble  that  it\r\n\r\nshall  be  the responsibility of the Government  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to care for the interests of the  Malays\r\n\r\nin   all  spheres  and  to  assist  them  in  their\r\n\r\nlanguage,  economy  and culture - Mr  Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nfour  years have elapsed since the P.A.P. came  to\r\n\r\npower in Singapore - but in my opinion, what has been\r\n\r\nenshrined  in the Preamble of the Constitution  has\r\n\r\nnot  been  fully implemented by the Government  and\r\n\r\nhas been the cause of dissatisfaction to the Malays\r\n\r\nin Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to debate the subject one point at a\r\n\r\ntime.  First,  on the subject of Malay settlements.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the settlement at Jalan Eunos, there\r\n\r\nare other areas which have been gazetted, including\r\n\r\nKaki  Bukit, Sembawang, Pasir Panjang, Ayer Gemuroh\r\n\r\nand Jurong. In these areas which have been gazetted\r\n\r\nas  Malay settlements, only one area, that  is  the\r\n\r\nKaki  Bukit  area,  has been  fully  developed  and\r\n\r\nbuilding lots allocated to Malays. However, in  the\r\n\r\ncase  of Pasir Panjang, Ayer Gemuroh and Sembawang,\r\n\r\nnothing  has  been done and I know that  many  have\r\n\r\nsubmitted their applications, but it is unfortunate\r\n\r\nthat Government have made no attempt to develop the\r\n\r\nland and allocate building\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlots  to applicants on the waiting list. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister has said that the Malays prefer to live in\r\n\r\nhouses  with compounds where they can rear poultry.\r\n\r\nHe  has further stated that in areas which are near\r\n\r\nthe  City area, land cannot be made available,  but\r\n\r\nland can be made available in the rural areas.  But\r\n\r\nI  know  the areas I have mentioned, such  as  Ayer\r\n\r\nGemuroh, Pasir Panjang and Sembawang. Although they\r\n\r\nare  a  great  distance from the city,  many  Malay\r\n\r\napplicants  have  submitted their applications  but\r\n\r\nGovernment  has no immediate programme to  allocate\r\n\r\nbuilding  sites.  Also on the subject  of  housing,\r\n\r\nthis  has  been touched upon by the Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nwho says that the Malays have no liking to live  in\r\n\r\nfiats  and  they  prefer to live in  kampongs.  The\r\n\r\nMalays  like  to live in flats in Singapore  if  we\r\n\r\nobserve the housing estates built in Queenstown and\r\n\r\nMountbatten  Road.  I  see  that  many  Malays  are\r\n\r\noccupying these flats. They are military and police\r\n\r\npersonnel; so that, to me, I think the Malays  have\r\n\r\nno  objection to living in flats. But there is  one\r\n\r\nmajor obstacle. The Malays are of Islamic faith. If\r\n\r\nthey  live  in fiats, they have to mix freely  with\r\n\r\nnon-Muslims  like  Chinese  or  Indians.   If   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  can give an assurance that out  of  ten\r\n\r\nblocks  of  fiats,  one or two  can  be  set  aside\r\n\r\nspecially for the Malays, I am confident  that  the\r\n\r\nMalays  will live in them; the idea being that  the\r\n\r\noccupants of a complete block of flats will  be  of\r\n\r\nMuslim religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point concerning special rights is\r\n\r\neducation. I congratulate the Government on  having\r\n\r\nbuilt  two Malay secondary schools, one at Aljunied\r\n\r\nRoad  and the other at Mountbatten Road.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nlong-term  programme  of  which  the  Parliamentary\r\n\r\nSecretary to the Prime Minister is aware. But these\r\n\r\nsecondary schools pose a big problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the problem of textbooks. Parents are not\r\n\r\nonly  unable to afford textbooks, but there is also\r\n\r\nthe  problem  of  making available  to  them  Malay\r\n\r\ntextbooks.   This   difficulty   is   also    being\r\n\r\nexperienced  by schools in the Federation.  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  with the formation  of  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nwill co-operate with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Education Ministry, Federation of  Malaya,  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  standard  of  textbooks  used  in  Malay\r\n\r\nsecondary  schools will be of the same standard  as\r\n\r\nthat used in the Federation of Malaya.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point concerns language. Here also it\r\n\r\nis  a  matter  of regret. One of my colleagues  has\r\n\r\nalready  raised  this  problem.  That  is  to  say,\r\n\r\nalthough the Government have declared publicly that\r\n\r\nMalay  has become the national language and one  of\r\n\r\nthe official languages in Singapore, the Government\r\n\r\nhave  not  taken positive steps whereby  Malay  can\r\n\r\nultimately  be  the national and the sole  official\r\n\r\nlanguage.  For  instance,  in  the  Federation   of\r\n\r\nMalaya, annual monthly language campaigns are being\r\n\r\nconducted  for  the  purpose  of  promoting   Malay\r\n\r\nespecially to non-Malays, but here in Singapore  no\r\n\r\nsuch campaigns have been planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth point concerns assistance to Sekolah\r\n\r\nRakyat.  This  has been in force from the  previous\r\n\r\nGovernment,  which  had rendered  help  to  Sekolah\r\n\r\nRakyat  (people's  schools). The  rules  then  were\r\n\r\nslightly relaxed. The requirements insisted upon by\r\n\r\nthe  Education Ministry now are rather  rigid.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  the  provision of  sanitary  and  health\r\n\r\nconditions.  The  school building must  conform  to\r\n\r\ncertain  standards. There have  been  many  grouses\r\n\r\nfrom  the  management  of  these  schools  because,\r\n\r\nbefore  Government could give assistance  to  them,\r\n\r\nstrict  conditions were imposed to the extent  that\r\n\r\nthe  money given to such schools could not be  used\r\n\r\nfor  the purpose of defraying the salaries  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.  When  the accounts of  the  schools  are\r\n\r\nsubmitted to the Education Ministry, it is required\r\n\r\nthat  the  auditors must be qualified auditors.  We\r\n\r\nknow  that  qualified auditors charge a minimum  of\r\n\r\n$100 for fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point concerning the special privileges of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  is  aid  in the  economic  field.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  everyone who reads the Utusan Melayu  and\r\n\r\nthe  Straits Times during the past week  must  have\r\n\r\nnoticed  that there has been heated debate  between\r\n\r\nthe  Utusan Melayu and the Straits Times as to  how\r\n\r\nto  help the economy of Malays in the Federation as\r\n\r\nwell  as  in Singapore. Even more so the Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore because it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  enshrined in the Constitution of Singapore that\r\n\r\nthe  Government  should  help  the  Malays  in  the\r\n\r\neconomic   field.   For  four  years   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment have assumed office, but the question of\r\n\r\naid  to  the Malays in the economic field  has  not\r\n\r\nbeen  given  proper  attention,  except  that  free\r\n\r\neducation has been given to the Malays from primary\r\n\r\nto university level, and of course the distribution\r\n\r\nof  goats to the people in the Southern Islands.  I\r\n\r\nhear  that on one island only male goats have  been\r\n\r\ndistributed.  There is not a single  she-goat.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   the   question  of  Malay   economy   is\r\n\r\nimportant. My suggestion is not aimed at  producing\r\n\r\nmore  Malay directors of this or that company,  but\r\n\r\nwith  a view to assisting, to uplifting the economy\r\n\r\nof   the  Malays.  The  Government  can  raise  the\r\n\r\neconomic status of the Malays and one way of  doing\r\n\r\nthis  is for the Government, if possible, to  train\r\n\r\nMalays  in factories which are being built  on  the\r\n\r\nJurong Industrial site. I hope the Government  will\r\n\r\nuse  their  good  offices to persuade  the  factory\r\n\r\ndirectors to take in more Malays so that  they  can\r\n\r\nbe   trained   to   hold   top   posts   in   these\r\n\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way by which Government can help the\r\n\r\nMalays is to build small factories where Government\r\n\r\ncan  provide capital on a 50-50 basis. Let  us  not\r\n\r\nthink  that the Malays in Singapore cannot  provide\r\n\r\nthe  capital needed. On the whole, the earnings  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in  Singapore are favourable  compared\r\n\r\nwith  those of the Malays in the Federation, if  we\r\n\r\nobserve  ten  houses  occupied  by  Malays  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation,  we  see  that only  two  have  radios,\r\n\r\nwhereas in Singapore, out of ten houses occupied by\r\n\r\nMalays, ten of them have radios: and now television\r\n\r\ntoo, so that the income of the Malays in Singapore,\r\n\r\nin  fact,  is more than that of the income  of  the\r\n\r\nMalays  in  the  Federation. If the Government  can\r\n\r\nbuild  small-scale factories where Government  will\r\n\r\nprovide  the capital on a 50-50 basis, I  think  we\r\n\r\ncan   encourage   the  Malays  to  participate   in\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another method whereby we can promote Malay\r\n\r\neconomy  is - I  refer  this  to  the  Minister   for\r\n\r\nFinance - to   set  up  investment  firms.   In   the\r\n\r\nFederation  this  has  been done  and  it  has  the\r\n\r\nsupport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  Government.  The  directors  comprise  two\r\n\r\nGovernment   servants  and  two  or  three   others\r\n\r\nnominated by the Government from among the  Malays.\r\n\r\nIn  Singapore  the Malays cannot use such  benefits\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are not citizens of the Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya. If the Government can set up such firms,  I\r\n\r\nthink  this will certainly go a long way to  assist\r\n\r\nthe  Malays  in Singapore. Certainly the Government\r\n\r\nwill  tell  us - will tell me because I put  up  this\r\n\r\nproposal - that the P.A.P. is a socialist Government\r\n\r\nand  according  to the principle of  socialism,  it\r\n\r\ncannot  engage itself in a capitalist  system.  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, I think it is true. But if I may speak  on\r\n\r\nfacts,  the  P.A.P. claims itself to be  socialist.\r\n\r\nBut the policies that have been implemented are not\r\n\r\nsocialist;  they  are a mixture  of  socialism  and\r\n\r\ncapitalism.   The   P.A.P. is  fraternising   with\r\n\r\ncapitalists  from abroad in order to persuade  them\r\n\r\nto  invest  their capital here. From the  long-term\r\n\r\npoint   of   view,  the  efforts  that  have   been\r\n\r\nundertaken by the P.A.P. Government to promote  and\r\n\r\nto  raise  the standard of living of the Malays  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, especially in respect of education,  are\r\n\r\ngood  but  we can see the fruits, say, in the  next\r\n\r\n10, 15 or 30 years. At this crucial moment, what do\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. Government intend to do to promote  the\r\n\r\nMalays  economically? Let the Government not  think\r\n\r\nthat  because  they  claim  they  are  a  Socialist\r\n\r\nGovernment,   they  cannot  engage  in   capitalist\r\n\r\nactivities.  If the Government are not  willing  to\r\n\r\ngive  serious consideration to this problem,  I  am\r\n\r\nafraid    there   will   arise   a    feeling    of\r\n\r\ndissatisfaction  among  the  Malays  in  Singapore,\r\n\r\nwhich  will in turn create problems which we cannot\r\n\r\novercome.    I   would   like   to    advise    the\r\n\r\nGovernment - after they have been in power  for  four\r\n\r\nyears,  because  I know that the  P.A.P. are  also\r\n\r\nawaiting  the  formation of Malaysia - to  adopt  the\r\n\r\nsuggestions I have put forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning my own constituency, Geylang Serai,\r\n\r\noriginally  there  were  many  objections  to   the\r\n\r\nGeylang Serai Project because the inhabitants  were\r\n\r\nnot  aware  of  the true object of the  Government.\r\n\r\nHowever, those people who supported the Project did\r\n\r\nso on certain conditions. One of the conditions is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  the hawkers who have been plying their  trade\r\n\r\nwill  now  be assured of a pitch after the  Geylang\r\n\r\nSerai   Project  materialises.  Secondly,   evicted\r\n\r\nfamilies   from   Geylang  Serai  must   be   given\r\n\r\naccommodation in the flats to be built.  This  also\r\n\r\nhas  been  promised by the Government. Thirdly - and\r\n\r\nthis  is most important - when evicted persons have\r\n\r\nbeen  allocated  flats or shophouses,  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will give an opportunity of ranting  the\r\n\r\nunallocated flats or shophouses to the Malays. As I\r\n\r\nexplained  earlier, the area has been predominantly\r\n\r\na  Malay area for decades, and, therefore,  I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  unallocated stalls or flats will be  allocated\r\n\r\nto Malays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, if you, Mr Speaker, have been\r\n\r\nfollowing  the position of the Malays in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom   the   point   of  view  of   the   Singapore\r\n\r\nConstitution,  I regret to say that the  Government\r\n\r\nhave not carried out their responsibilities towards\r\n\r\nthe  Malays in Singapore as is required of them  in\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Constitution. However,  on  my  own\r\n\r\npart,  I  wish  to  say that, on  the  question  of\r\n\r\neducation,   I  congratulate  the  Government   for\r\n\r\ncarrying  out  their responsibilities  towards  the\r\n\r\nMalays as they have promised - the only one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, \"That the proceedings on item 10 on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper  be  exempted from the  provisions  of\r\n\r\nStanding  Order No. 1 until 12 midnight.\"-[Dr  Toh Chin Chye]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is my intention to suspend at half-past eight for one hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>YANG DI-PERTUAN NEGARA'S</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SPEECH</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Debate on the Address)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.22 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we\r\n\r\nhave  come to the grand finale of the P.A.P. drama.\r\n\r\nAs we approach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnearer to the closing scenes, we cannot help\r\n\r\nfeeling  touched to see the last days of this  once\r\n\r\ngreat  Party drawing closer, for it is apparent  to\r\n\r\nus  that no miracle can save this P.A.P.

There was not the bounce and the note of absolute confidence that were in the speech in the First Session of the Assembly, with 43 seats on the Government side. The tone and the language have changed with each\r\n\r\nsubsequent  Session. During the  beginning  of  the\r\n\r\nSecond Session, the number of Government seats  was\r\n\r\nreduced  to  40;  at  the beginning  of  the  Third\r\n\r\nSession,  13 Members defected from the P.A.P.;  and\r\n\r\nin  this final Session, the P.A.P. Government  with\r\n\r\nonly  25  Members, having lost their  mandate,  are\r\n\r\nliving from day to day on the charity of the S.P.A.-Alliance which it despises. The last policy  speech\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. Government was empty, lifeless,  but\r\n\r\nfull  of  veiled  threats. It was  couched  in  the\r\n\r\nlanguage and the tone of a Government that has been\r\n\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. are finished. The flock might now know\r\n\r\nwhere  the  future lies, but not the  shepherd.  We\r\n\r\nmust   give  the  shepherd  some  credit  for   his\r\n\r\npolitical  knowledge and his grasp  of  the  ground\r\n\r\nposition,  however  superficial  it  may  be.   The\r\n\r\nshepherd knows that the P.A.P. ship is heading  for\r\n\r\nthe rocks. Once the ship is piloted along the wrong\r\n\r\ncourse,  it  will eventually hit the rocks  and  no\r\n\r\namount of whitewashing of the ship can save it from\r\n\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ground position is this. Being\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the  assessment  of  the   ground\r\n\r\nposition  for  the  City Council  and  the  general\r\n\r\nelections, I think I can speak\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwith some authority on the situation. There is  now\r\n\r\nnot  one single constituency in Singapore that  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. can claim as a safe seat - not even one,  Sir.\r\n\r\nNot  even  Sembawang can be claimed as a safe  seat\r\n\r\ndespite  its being nurtured for nearly  four  years\r\n\r\nwith  the  greatest investment  per  voter  in  the\r\n\r\nprovision of water, light, street-lights, telephone\r\n\r\nbooths, rural roads and various other amenities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days of the P.A.P. are therefore numbered. One\r\n\r\nthing with the P.A.P. leadership is that they  talk\r\n\r\nof  democracy  but never practise  it.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  is incapable of tolerating a democratic\r\n\r\nOpposition and of gracefully withdrawing  from  the\r\n\r\nscene  when  their time is up. The irony  that  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  Opposition can survive in Singapore  is\r\n\r\nbecause   there   are   three  Governments   making\r\n\r\ndecisions  upon our future, namely,  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment,   the   British  Government   and   the\r\n\r\nFederation  Government. Whatever we might  disagree\r\n\r\nwith   the   policies  of  the  present  Federation\r\n\r\nGovernment, we must say that it is more capable  of\r\n\r\ntolerating  a  democratic  Opposition.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership  is different. It comprises of  men  who\r\n\r\nrefuse   to   understand  the   true   meaning   of\r\n\r\ncompetition  for  political leadership  within  the\r\n\r\ndemocratic  framework. Never  have  we  seen  in  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic  system  the vast array  of  weapons  of\r\n\r\noppression, suppression and victimisation being  so\r\n\r\nfully developed and deployed to crush all political\r\n\r\nopposition. The Lim Yew Hock Government looks  like\r\n\r\na  dwarf in this respect. Therefore, in this three-power control over Singapore, the mockery of it  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Singapore Government is the most vicious.\r\n\r\nPersonal  feelings  are mixed with  differences  of\r\n\r\nParty  policies;  political treachery  is  combined\r\n\r\nwith  ruthlessness: arrogance is blended  with  the\r\n\r\ncapacity to twist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with this background that we should read\r\n\r\ninto  the deeper meaning of the Government's policy\r\n\r\nspeech. It painted to us a gloomy picture of  black\r\n\r\nclouds  hanging  over the horizon. The  self-styled\r\n\r\n\"saviour   of  democracy\"  was  in  the   forefront\r\n\r\nfighting to save us from the \"enemies of democracy\"\r\n\r\nlike Saint George fighting the Dragon in order to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsave  England. Sir, it was this same Saint  George,\r\n\r\nas  late as March 1961, before he was canonised, in\r\n\r\nhis  own  self-confession, who told us he regularly\r\n\r\nheld  meetings  with the Dragon.  Although  I  have\r\n\r\nknown Saint George before he was canonised, it  was\r\n\r\nthe  first time I heard of the Dragon. The  picture\r\n\r\nof  darkness  and  gloom  outlined  in  the  policy\r\n\r\nspeech,  is in our opinion, meant to condition  the\r\n\r\nminds  of the people, and lay the spade-work for  a\r\n\r\nsecond mass swoop before the general elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming months will be interesting as we watch\r\n\r\nevents   unfolding  themselves  with  even  greater\r\n\r\nspeed.  If  in  the by-election of  Sembawang,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. by a stroke of good fortune happen to  win,\r\n\r\nthen  we  can  expect  general  elections  for  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   State   Assembly,   under    the    new\r\n\r\nConstitution  within the Malaysian Plan  framework,\r\n\r\nto  come  soon after, but if the P.A.P. lose  this\r\n\r\nseat in the by-election, then we can expect to  see\r\n\r\nmore  P.A.P. mischief and more magic  shows  being\r\n\r\ndirected  and performed, and the general  elections\r\n\r\nindefinitely  postponed, until  the  S.P.A-Alliance\r\n\r\nconsiders it-ripe enough, in its own interests,  to\r\n\r\nwithdraw  its  support, topple the  Government  and\r\n\r\nforce the elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is therefore time for us to draw a balance-sheet of the P.A.P. Never has a Government lost\r\n\r\npopular support within such a short space of  time.\r\n\r\nLong  before the defeat of the P.A.P. in  the  Hong\r\n\r\nLim  and Anson by-elections, they had already  lost\r\n\r\nthe  masses. The results of rolling of the two  by-elections were only manifestations of the  shifting\r\n\r\nof  ground which happened long before the  two  by-elections.   The  P.A.P.  Government  lost   public\r\n\r\nconfidence  very  rapid1y  after  they  formed  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The  masses voted the  P.A.P. on  the\r\n\r\nrecord of the City Council work. It turned out that\r\n\r\nthe  Lee  Kuan Yew government was not much  better,\r\n\r\nafter  all,  than the Lim Yew Hock Government.  The\r\n\r\nmasses  soon  lost  their confidence.  They  became\r\n\r\ndisillusioned.  Political parties are  like  banks.\r\n\r\nOnce  a  bank  publicly cheats  its  customers,  no\r\n\r\namount of publicity or inducements will be able  to\r\n\r\nrestore  public confidence for customers  to  place\r\n\r\ndeposits  with  it.  Despite the  Prime  Minister's\r\n\r\nvisits to the rural constituencies,   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndespite   the   fanfare,    despite    the\r\n\r\nentertainment and the publicity, all  these  things\r\n\r\nwill  not  be able to revive the PA.P.  The  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleaders   may  be  able  to  deceive  the   British\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  that it commands popular  support.\r\n\r\nThe British representatives are not in contact with\r\n\r\nthe  ordinary men who make up the sum total of  the\r\n\r\nelectorate.  The British might be easily  persuaded\r\n\r\nto  believe  that once the Member for Hong  Lim  is\r\n\r\ndetained, though ridiculous it would seem to be  as\r\n\r\nhe  has  also  been a former member  of  that  most\r\n\r\nexclusive club, the Internal Security Council,  the\r\n\r\nground  is open for contest only between the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister and the Member for Cairnhill, and in  this\r\n\r\ncontest the P.A.P. thinks, but with which I beg  to\r\n\r\ndiffer from them, that it will win.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the elections to come, people will vote\r\n\r\nfor  any other Party, or even Independents, but not\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P.  The  ability to twist  and  turn  both\r\n\r\ninside  and  outside this Chamber is no  substitute\r\n\r\nfor  consistency  in politics. In this  connection,\r\n\r\nSir,  it  must be remembered that once the  British\r\n\r\nsupported the Progressives. The Progressives  lost.\r\n\r\nIt  later  switched its support to the  S.P.A.  The\r\n\r\nS.P.A. lost. Now it is betting on the P.A.P. and,\r\n\r\nfrom  the  nature  of things, he whom  the  British\r\n\r\nsupports  will  lose. I must say that  the  British\r\n\r\nhave great powers of auto-suggestion. They read the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times.  They listened to sweet-honey  talk\r\n\r\nbetween   cocktails.  Unfortunately,  unlike   King\r\n\r\nMidas,  whatever the British touched did  not  turn\r\n\r\ninto  gold,  but  instead relics for  the  national\r\n\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, let us take a lesson from\r\n\r\nthe failings of the P.A.P. Government. It tries  to\r\n\r\nbe  too  smart.  I has no consistent  policies.  It\r\n\r\nplays  all sides. Having worked with the Communists\r\n\r\nuntil  and  during  the Hong  Lim  by-election,  it\r\n\r\nplayed   them  out.  Then  leading  the  Federation\r\n\r\nleaders  up  the garden path, it tries to  sour  up\r\n\r\nthings at the last minute, trying to challenge  who\r\n\r\nshould   be  the  rent  collector  in  the   future\r\n\r\nSingapore Government and making a big issue out  of\r\n\r\nit, I would say for electioneering purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the P.A.P. Government is now fighting against\r\n\r\nthe  Federation  Government is  the  right  of  who\r\n\r\nshould  be  the rent collector. The P.A.P. is  now\r\n\r\nhaving  false dreams after its visits to the  rural\r\n\r\nconstituencies that it can continue to be the  next\r\n\r\nGovernment,   and   having   surrendered   to   the\r\n\r\nFederation the meat earlier, namely, the  right  to\r\n\r\nregulate  and decide our own financial and economic\r\n\r\npolicies,  it now wants to fight for the bones - to\r\n\r\nbe  a  rent collector, in other words. For it seems\r\n\r\nto  them  now that unless this is being  done,  its\r\n\r\npresent Minister for Finance would lose his post if\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. really can have a second go. The P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  now getting famous,  Sir,  for  its\r\n\r\ndouble  talk  and its double face. There  are  many\r\n\r\nexamples  of this double face policies, and  double\r\n\r\ntalk  is  a dangerous game which is sure  of  being\r\n\r\ncaught in the end. I would not be surprised if  the\r\n\r\nBritish  lion  one day got played out  too.  Double\r\n\r\ntalk, zigzagging, is a characteristic of the P.A.P.\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the example of Malayan and Indonesian\r\n\r\nrelations.  What is the open and unequivocal  stand\r\n\r\nof  the  Prime Minister of Singapore on this issue?\r\n\r\nIndonesia's  verbal opposition to Malaysia  is  one\r\n\r\nthing. But suppose Indonesia's confrontation policy\r\n\r\nbecomes  hot, and suppose it decides to  resort  to\r\n\r\nmilitary   force,  would  the  Prime  Minister   of\r\n\r\nSingapore  still sit on the fence as  he  is  doing\r\n\r\nnow,  or would he openly come forward to rally  the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore against any militant action  by\r\n\r\nIndonesia?  What  happens to  our  so-called  great\r\n\r\npatriot?  Why  is he so equivocal and non-committal\r\n\r\nand   double-faced?  I  say  I   have   contributed\r\n\r\nsubstantially  to  the  establishment  of  friendly\r\n\r\nrelations between Singapore and Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in our Party programme, Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  to  maintain friendly relations with all  our\r\n\r\nneighbours. But I say that in the event we are ever\r\n\r\nthreatened with military action from Indonesia,  it\r\n\r\nis  a  different  matter  altogether,  and  we,  as\r\n\r\nCitizens of this country, no matter whether we  are\r\n\r\nMalays  or Chinese, Indians or Eurasians,  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  stand up and defend it.  We  must  be\r\n\r\nprepared  to state unequivocally our stand  despite\r\n\r\nour\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopposition  to the terms and conditions of  merger.\r\n\r\nNothing. Sir, can save the P.A.P. now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talk of the Prime Minister just now of his\r\n\r\ngigantic  projects - the  Outram  Gaol  scheme,   the\r\n\r\nJohore  River  scheme, the Bedok  land  reclamation\r\n\r\nscheme, this scheme, that scheme, brought in during\r\n\r\nthis final phase of the P.A.P. reign, are meant  to\r\n\r\ndeceive the people for electioneering purposes. The\r\n\r\nlease  of life of the P.A.P. Government is so short\r\n\r\nnow  that  it can talk big, can talk of huge  giant\r\n\r\nprojects    without   having   to    assume    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of implementing them or to  complete\r\n\r\nthem. None of this talk can deceive the people  and\r\n\r\nhelp  to  resuscitate the P.A.P. There is  not  one\r\n\r\nsingle  section   of the population  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwhich  now supports the P.A.P. Let us ask ourselves\r\n\r\nwhich   section  of  the  population  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nsupports  the  P.A.P., whether they be  workers  or\r\n\r\nfarmers,  trishaw-riders or hawkers, civil servants\r\n\r\nor shop-keepers, rich or poor. No single section of\r\n\r\nthe population has any more trust in the P.A.P. The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. might  have  isolated support  from  a  few\r\n\r\nindividuals  in each section, from those  who  have\r\n\r\nobtained   personal  benefits   from   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment,  but the P.A.P. now has  lost  all  its\r\n\r\nbase.  Not  one section of the people is its  base.\r\n\r\nNot  one single constituency among the 51 is a safe\r\n\r\nseat for the P.A.P. It is, therefore, easy, Sir, to\r\n\r\nunderstand the reasons for the recent mass arrests\r\n\r\nand  maybe possible future mass arrests before  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  elections  are  to  come.  But  all  these\r\n\r\nactions  would only bring the P.A.P. further  down\r\n\r\nthe drain. The P.A.P. can have sweet dreams and can\r\n\r\nforce  the people to go to the polis, but it cannot\r\n\r\nforce  the  people to vote for it in spite  of  its\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres  and  Work  Brigade,  radio  and\r\n\r\ntelevision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, despite its much publicised massive\r\n\r\nconstruction,  it has little chance  of  staging  a\r\n\r\ncome-back. It genuinely believes that if the ground\r\n\r\ncan  be  cleared - and that the P.A.P. thinks is  its\r\n\r\nlast hope - for a fight only between two contestants,\r\n\r\nthe  Prime  Minister and the Member for  Cairnhill,\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will therefore win first,  because  it\r\n\r\nwill try to pose itself as being a socialist Party\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagain.

The  air  of  hypocrisy   was\r\n\r\napparent. There was, of course, the usual  din - the\r\n\r\nceremonial highlights, the guard of honour, the 21-gun  salute,  and above all, Sir, the usual  annual\r\n\r\nmarch  of  the P.A.P. legislators. As in  the  case\r\n\r\nlast year, they all marched in their whites, led by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister who incidentally was also in his\r\n\r\nwhite  uniform.  Nonetheless,  Sir,  there  was   a\r\n\r\ndifference. There was a bitter taste. The hypocrisy\r\n\r\nof   the  whole  show  was  evident.  There  is  no\r\n\r\ndemocracy in Singapore. The so-called parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  is merely in form and not in  substance.\r\n\r\nDemocracy   in  Singapore  is  a  farce   that   is\r\n\r\nprostituted by the P.A.P. Government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let there be no illusions about this. It is\r\n\r\nno  use pretending that this traditional debate  on\r\n\r\nGovernment policy is a reflection of any democratic\r\n\r\nsystem   in  Singapore.  After  a  long  spell   of\r\n\r\nprorogation the P.A.P. finally decided to call  for\r\n\r\na Session for its own ulterior motives, among which\r\n\r\nis  to  show the people in Singapore and also those\r\n\r\noutside Singapore that there is still democracy  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, and that there is still such a thing  as\r\n\r\nthe constitutional method of open argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recent events have proved that parliamentary\r\n\r\ndemocracy  in  Singapore  is  as  good   as   dead.\r\n\r\nParliamentary   democracy,  as   such,   has   been\r\n\r\nthoroughly  discredited and exposed by  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nwhich  claims  to safeguard the whole  system.  The\r\n\r\nblatant  abuse  of the system by  the  P.A.P.,  the\r\n\r\ndenial  of  democratic liberties  and  rights,  the\r\n\r\ncomplete control of the Press, the radio,  and  now\r\n\r\nT.V.; the shameless rigging of the referendum,  the\r\n\r\narbitrary arrests, the banning of publications, and\r\n\r\neven  the  P.A.P.'s  conduct in this  Chamber,  all\r\n\r\nexpose the hypocrisy of the P.A.P. who claim to  be\r\n\r\ndefenders of democracy. Parliamentary democracy has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  a  mockery of by the P.A.P. Suppression\r\n\r\nand  reprisals  by  a  vindictive  and  dictatorial\r\n\r\nP.A.P. clique, whose deceit and dishonesty surpass\r\n\r\nthat  of  all  previous governments, including  the\r\n\r\ncolonial government, is the order of the day. While\r\n\r\nwe have this debate, Sir, let us also bear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  mind  that  all this is farce  because  of  the\r\n\r\nbackground and because of what goes on outside this\r\n\r\nHouse. This Assembly sitting is just a pretence  of\r\n\r\ndemocracy in an otherwise complete police State: we\r\n\r\nare   perhaps  just  one  step  behind  a  complete\r\n\r\ndictatorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the emasculated P.A.P. report delivered by\r\n\r\nthe  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara  is  tantamount  to  a\r\n\r\nplaintive appeal for approval of the P.A.P.'s  past\r\n\r\nand  present  failures. This  is  hardly  a  policy\r\n\r\nspeech.  The speech contains an introduction  which\r\n\r\nsays  nothing,  and a conclusion which  is  equally\r\n\r\neloquent  in  saying nothing. In between,  Sir,  we\r\n\r\nhave   an   impoverished   review   of   Government\r\n\r\nactivities which are terribly inadequate even as  a\r\n\r\nrecord  of P.A.P.'s \"achievements\" in the past  one\r\n\r\nand a half years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is suggested that the Barisan Sosialis has\r\n\r\nlost the open argument this time.

Forms of constitutional  struggle\r\n\r\nthat   are   common  in  countries  which  practise\r\n\r\nparliamentary   democracy  are   not   allowed   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   Even  this  Assembly  was   given   an\r\n\r\nunprecedented long recess thereby ensuring complete\r\n\r\nerasure of any form of opposition. The Sembawang by-election  has not been held. Sir, all these  things\r\n\r\nare  done because the P.A.P. know that it  is  they\r\n\r\nwho  have lost the open argument. The magnitude  of\r\n\r\nthe repressive measures adopted by the P.A.P. is  a\r\n\r\nclear  indication of the strength of the opposition\r\n\r\nthe  Government  faces, it is the Government  which\r\n\r\nhas  lost  the  open argument, and hence  finds  it\r\n\r\nnecessary  to resort to taking repressive measures.\r\n\r\nThe  Barisan, however, Sir, is very confident  that\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding   any  repressive   acts   of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, it shall eventually crush the P.A.P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. is no longer a political force. It\r\n\r\ndoes not represent the Right, nor does it represent\r\n\r\nthe  Left.  It is an opportunist force. Today,  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is  still  surviving  because,  and   only\r\n\r\nbecause,  it has the use of the State machinery  in\r\n\r\nits hands. It is a force only in the sense that  it\r\n\r\nhas  the  use  of State organs. It has  the  radio,\r\n\r\nT.V., the police, the Work Brigade, and it has  the\r\n\r\nPress completely subjugated. It survives because of\r\n\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introductory portion of the speech with\r\n\r\nits  \"quiet note of confidence\" is fallacious.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  Government  has  no confidence  in  itself;\r\n\r\nneither  does  it  have the confidence  of  anybody\r\n\r\nother than colonial and reactionary forces. Sir,  I\r\n\r\nunderstand that even these reactionary and colonial\r\n\r\nforces distrust the P.A.P., for they are aware that\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. will stab them in the back one of these\r\n\r\ndays.  Only  53 days before the formal  opening  of\r\n\r\nthis  Session  of  the  Legislative  Assembly,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   arrested  133   of   their   political\r\n\r\nopponents and banned 10 publications which had been\r\n\r\ncritical of Government policies. This arbitrary and\r\n\r\nundemocratic action was that of desperate  men  who\r\n\r\nwere  not  confident of their future in a fair  and\r\n\r\nopen fight. These actions were the direct result of\r\n\r\nthe   lack  of  confidence  on  the  part  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment to continue the so-called open  argument\r\n\r\neven  though  they  have the Press  under  complete\r\n\r\ncontrol. The P.A.P. resorted to arbitrary detention\r\n\r\nof  political opponents because they did  not  have\r\n\r\nthe confidence of winning the constitutional fight.\r\n\r\nSir, it was because of this lack of confidence that\r\n\r\nthe   P.A.P. continues  to  take  all   forms   of\r\n\r\nundemocratic   actions   and   to   impose   severe\r\n\r\nlimitations  on  the  Opposition.  The  people  are\r\n\r\ndenied  civil liberties, publications  are  banned,\r\n\r\nmeetings  are  restricted,  meetings  of  Left-wing\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  are  banned,  the  S.A.T.U. is  not\r\n\r\nregistered,  the  S.A.T.U. annual  conference  was\r\n\r\nbanned,  the  referendum was  legally  rigged.  All\r\n\r\nthese  were  done, Sir, not because the P.A.P. was\r\n\r\nconfident,  but because these measures  were  their\r\n\r\nonly means to hold on to power. Perhaps, Sir, after\r\n\r\nthe mass arrests they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  trying  to feel confident and this  desire  to\r\n\r\nfeel  confident could have crept into the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's speech. Perhaps  they  feel  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  a short breathing spell for them.  This,\r\n\r\nSir,  we can assure them is a mere illusion and  no\r\n\r\namount  of  wishful thinking on  the  part  of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. is going to change realities. The P.A.P. is\r\n\r\ndoomed to die sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction also refers to storms and\r\n\r\ntempests.  This  sounds more like  a  leaf  from  a\r\n\r\nMickey  Spillane  thriller.  There  is  a  definite\r\n\r\nattempt  on  their  part  to  give  the  impression\r\n\r\namongst  the public that Singapore had  been  faced\r\n\r\nwith  some  impending catastrophe  which  they  had\r\n\r\naverted by their recent actions. There was no  such\r\n\r\nsituation.  This bogey is presented to  the  public\r\n\r\nmerely   to   justify  their  recent   undemocratic\r\n\r\nactions, to hide the evil machinations and  further\r\n\r\nrepressive measures which they have in mind  for  a\r\n\r\nfuture  date.  The storm, if any,  was  only  in  a\r\n\r\nteacup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is\r\n\r\nsolely aimed at over-emphasising routine activities\r\n\r\nof  the  P.A.P.  Government in the past  year.  The\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  certain  obligations  to  perform  by\r\n\r\nvirtue  of  the fact that they are the  Government.\r\n\r\nThe  routine opening of schools, community centres,\r\n\r\netc., are about the minimum obligations that can be\r\n\r\nexpected  from a government whose members are  paid\r\n\r\nout of public pockets in the expectation that these\r\n\r\nobligations will be fulfilled so as to  ensure  the\r\n\r\ncontinuity of the normal livelihood of our  people.\r\n\r\nThe P.A.P. seek to play up these routine duties  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government which they themselves described  in\r\n\r\nthe  previous policy speech on the 31st of  August,\r\n\r\n1961,  as  mundane matters; obviously, Sir,  in  an\r\n\r\nattempt  to  win public sympathy. This  is  exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  the  previous Government under the leadership\r\n\r\nof  the Member for Cairnhill did in its last stages\r\n\r\njust before the elections in 1959. Sir, it will not\r\n\r\nbe  out  of  place to remind the P.A.P. that  this\r\n\r\nstunt did not deceive the people in 1959, and there\r\n\r\nis  no  doubt  the P.A.P. also cannot deceive  them\r\n\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the substance of the speech even as a review\r\n\r\nof  Government  activities is inadequate.  Further,\r\n\r\nthe speech does not even outline the basic features\r\n\r\nof  Government's general policy. Under  every  head\r\n\r\nthe  activities of the past year are recounted  and\r\n\r\nany  future plans vaguely left behind. Future plans\r\n\r\nare  completely vague and are in the form  of  very\r\n\r\ngeneralised  statements. Column 5 of  the  Hansard,\r\n\r\nfor  example, Sir. We are told that there are funds\r\n\r\nto  see  us through all the major projects for  the\r\n\r\nimmediate  years ahead. Sir, what are  these  major\r\n\r\nprojects?  When we seek to look for them,  we  find\r\n\r\nthat  we  are given the oft-repeated Toa Payoh  new\r\n\r\ntown,  the  rebuilding of the  old  city,  and  the\r\n\r\nJurong  industrial base. Three projects  which  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have  been talking about for a  very,  very\r\n\r\nlong time. Column 6 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Most significant and gratifying of all has been\r\n\r\nthe  quiet  and steady expansion of new  factories.\r\n\r\nEvery  other  week  sees the opening  of  some  new\r\n\r\nindustrial  enterprise. Every month  sees  a  major\r\n\r\nproject  take shape in the Jurong Industrial  Site.\r\n\r\nThe future augurs well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This again, Sir, is a vague and generalised\r\n\r\nstatement which does not specify Government  plans.\r\n\r\nWe  are  not even told how many workers  have  been\r\n\r\nemployed as a result of these ventures. We are  not\r\n\r\ntold  to  what extent the unemployment problem  has\r\n\r\nbeen  relieved  us a result of these so-called  new\r\n\r\nindustries.  Sir, the omission is  because  of  the\r\n\r\nfact  that new employment as a result of  this  has\r\n\r\nbeen   almost  negligible.  Column  9  is   another\r\n\r\nexample, Sir, of vague generalised statements  from\r\n\r\na bankrupt Government which has no definite policy.\r\n\r\nI quote, Sir, from the second paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The whole task of rebuilding our city is one of\r\n\r\nmonumental  proportions. It will  need  finance  of\r\n\r\nmore  than  a  thousand million  dollars  and  will\r\n\r\nengage  our energies over several decades.  But  at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of it, we shall have built a new city  of\r\n\r\nbeauty and distinction, worthy of the industry  and\r\n\r\nenterprise of our people, and in keeping  with  our\r\n\r\nposition   as   the   financial,   industrial   and\r\n\r\ncommercial centre of South East Asia.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  \"the  whole  task   of\r\n\r\nrebuilding  our city is of monumental proportions.\"\r\n\r\nYou will note\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  there is absolutely nothing said except  what\r\n\r\neverybody knows. We know that the rebuilding of our\r\n\r\ncity  is of monumental proportions. We do not  have\r\n\r\nto  have  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech,\r\n\r\nwhich   is  supposed  to  be  the  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, which is supposed to contain  definite\r\n\r\nGovernment proposals and programmes for the future,\r\n\r\ntelling  us  this,  instead of explaining  how  the\r\n\r\npolicy of the Government is directed to tackle  the\r\n\r\nproblem and how do the Government propose to  raise\r\n\r\nmore than $1,000 million. Besides this much-talked-about  Outram site, which other site have  they  in\r\n\r\nmind?  The  Government do not even  say  when  they\r\n\r\npropose  to begin this Outram scheme and when  they\r\n\r\nexpect to complete it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are only two paragraphs devoted to the\r\n\r\nsubject  of  labour  in the policy  speech  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  which professes to be  pro-labour.  One\r\n\r\nrefers  to the Industrial Arbitration Court -  just\r\n\r\none  sentence.  And the other, Mr Deputy  Speaker,\r\n\r\nrefers to the Labour Research Unit - two sentences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How many sentences do you want?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> Sir, the Labour Research Unit is a\r\n\r\nP.A.P. outfit,  financed by  the  Government.  All\r\n\r\nthose  who are attached to this unit are well known\r\n\r\nfor  their  P.A.P. affiliations. Public  funds  are\r\n\r\nused  to further P.A.P. interests. This unit  helps\r\n\r\nP.A.P. trade unions, provides materials, etc.  Even\r\n\r\nactual  negotiations are done by some of  them  for\r\n\r\nthe  P.A.P. unions. When the arrests were  carried\r\n\r\nout,  some  of  these men who are attached  to  the\r\n\r\nResearch  Unit  and who are paid by Government,  on\r\n\r\nbehalf  of  the  P.A.P., approached the  non-P.A.P.\r\n\r\nunions  and  offered to negotiate for them  because\r\n\r\ntheir leaders were in detention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is significant to note that a Government\r\n\r\nwhich  professes  to  be  pro-labour  has  made  no\r\n\r\nmention of its labour policies in its speech.  Sir,\r\n\r\nit  is  also significant to note differences  among\r\n\r\nthe references to labour in 1960, 1961 and 1963. In\r\n\r\n1960,  Sir, there was the assurance that the  Trade\r\n\r\nUnion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill,  which passed through this Assembly and which\r\n\r\nwas  prevented  in  an  unprecedented  manner  from\r\n\r\nhaving  the  assent of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara,\r\n\r\nwill be re-introduced. In 1961, Sir, there was  no-mention  of this Bill at all in the policy  speech.\r\n\r\nAnd again, this year, there is no reference to this\r\n\r\nBill.  It  is now three years since the  time  this\r\n\r\nassurance was given in 1960. The unification of the\r\n\r\ntrade union movement was an election pledge of  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. Up to now, the Government have not kept  its\r\n\r\npledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1960, the Government talked about a Labour\r\n\r\nAdvisory  Committee.  We  hear  nothing  about   it\r\n\r\nanymore.  In  1960,  the  Government  promised  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Bill  which would  revise  the  Clerks,\r\n\r\nLabour  and  Shop Assistants Employment  Ordinances\r\n\r\nand  include  protection for  other  categories  of\r\n\r\nworkers not covered by existing labour legislation.\r\n\r\nI  quote  the exact words from the Hansard,  Volume\r\n\r\n13, No. 1, column 14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An Employment Bill will be introduced which will\r\n\r\nrepeal  the  three  Ordinances  dealing  with   the\r\n\r\nconditions   of   labourers,   clerks   and    shop\r\n\r\nassistants.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was on 20th July, 1960.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961, Sir, they also said that they would\r\n\r\nintroduce this Employment Ordinance. This is Volume\r\n\r\n15, column 23, dated 31st October, 1961:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A new Employment Ordinance which will consolidate\r\n\r\nthe  existing  Ordinances pertaining to  labourers,\r\n\r\nclerks  and  shop assistants will he introduced  in\r\n\r\nthe coming year.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>That was 1961. 1963 finds no such reference at  all\r\n\r\nin the policy speech. The Government again have not\r\n\r\nkept  their  election pledges, and  in  the  speech\r\n\r\nbefore the House we find no reference at all to the\r\n\r\nrevision   of  the  existing  outdated   Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinances,  and  also  to  the  need  for   proper\r\n\r\nlegislation to protect large groups of workers  who\r\n\r\nare  not  given  safeguards under  existing  labour\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. have broken every pledge they made\r\n\r\nto  the  workers on whose votes they  were  elected\r\n\r\ninto  office. It is hypocritical for the P.A.P. to\r\n\r\nprofess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be pro-labour. Sir, we find all over  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. report  a  complete  absence  of  specific\r\n\r\nGovernment policies and programmes for the  future,\r\n\r\nexcept very vague generalised statements, with  one\r\n\r\nor two projects repeated over and over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We realise that the more urgent and immediate\r\n\r\nproblems  facing our people are those  of  housing,\r\n\r\nschools,  hospitals, etc. Sir, to be able  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe increasing needs of our people, the Government,\r\n\r\nin  the  first  place, must have a  sound  economic\r\n\r\npolicy.  Since 1959, when the P.A.P. took  office,\r\n\r\nour  economic ills, far from improving,  have  only\r\n\r\nworsened.  Notwithstanding the number of industries\r\n\r\nthat  have  been given pioneer status, the  present\r\n\r\nunemployment  figure is no doubt  higher  than  the\r\n\r\n1959   figure.  We  are  certain  that  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment cannot solve the basic economic problems\r\n\r\nif they continue to work within the framework of  a\r\n\r\ncolonial  economy. Singapore's economy is dependent\r\n\r\non its entrepot status, and this is insufficient to\r\n\r\nmeet,  as  has been proved, the increasing  demands\r\n\r\nfor employment opportunities. Apparently, everybody\r\n\r\nis  agreed  on  the  need for industrialisation  to\r\n\r\nreduce unemployment and to increase prosperity. Yet\r\n\r\nit  is strange that the P.A.P. have made no mention\r\n\r\nof    their    approach   to   the    problem    of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation in the speech  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. Since 1959, the P.A.P. have not, in\r\n\r\nfact,   outlined   their   basic   policy   towards\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, apart from following up  on  the\r\n\r\nprevious   Government's  policies  of   encouraging\r\n\r\nprivate investment. This is clear evidence that the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. have deviated from their election  pledges.\r\n\r\nIn  1959, the P.A.P. said that \"we should not  face\r\n\r\nour economic problems in an era of freedom with the\r\n\r\nmental attitude appropriate to colonial servitude.\"\r\n\r\nHowever,  today they are still openly depending  on\r\n\r\nthe   entrepot  economy  of  Singapore,  and  their\r\n\r\nbleating  about foreign capital for  investment  is\r\n\r\nstill   an   attitude   appropriate   to   colonial\r\n\r\nservitude. Everyone - the capitalists included - knows\r\n\r\nthat  the P.A.P.'s economic policy in practice  has\r\n\r\nbeen a failure. Their industrialisation projects so\r\n\r\nfar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncarried  out have been of little significance.  The\r\n\r\ntendency  of the P.A.P. has been to blame  militant\r\n\r\ntrade  unionism  for  the  insufficient  inflow  of\r\n\r\nforeign  capital  to  meet  our  requirements   for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. We have time and  again  pointed\r\n\r\nout  the  fallacy  of blaming labour  for  economic\r\n\r\nstagnation.  If  industrialisation  has  not  taken\r\n\r\nplace  at  the  rate required, then the  Government\r\n\r\nmust  admit  their own failures instead of  looking\r\n\r\nfor  a scapegoat. Sir, the availability of capital,\r\n\r\nmarkets,  etc, are  far more important  conditions\r\n\r\nthat  are necessary as pre-requisites to facilitate\r\n\r\nindustrialisation. The P.A.P., apart  from  blaming\r\n\r\nmilitant labour - particularly the Left-wing trade\r\n\r\nunions - for   the   P.A.P.'s   failure   to   effect\r\n\r\nindustrialisation on a scale necessary,  have  done\r\n\r\nnothing positive in terms of acquiring capital  and\r\n\r\nexpanding   markets.  In  1959,  they  said   \"they\r\n\r\nprofoundly disagreed that the survival of Singapore\r\n\r\ndepends    on    foreign   capital   and    foreign\r\n\r\ncapitalists\", but today the emphasis  is  still  on\r\n\r\nforeign capital and foreign capitalists. Today, the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.  have  done  nothing  to  remedy  the  lack  of\r\n\r\nsufficient  capital  for  industrialisation,  other\r\n\r\nthan depending on a few foreign capitalists to open\r\n\r\nindustries, whose impact is insignificant. Contrary\r\n\r\nto   P.A.P. pledges  in  1959,  the  Government's\r\n\r\noverseas investments have more than doubled.  Vague\r\n\r\nsuggestions have also been made that Malaysia  will\r\n\r\nmean economic prosperity for Singapore. Today,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government,  or the  Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya, have not explained  how  this\r\n\r\neconomic prosperity is to be brought about. It  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,   implied   that   Malaysia   will    mean\r\n\r\nindustrialisation, expanded markets, etc. I  notice\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for  Finance has  left  the  Chamber\r\n\r\nobviously, he has no answer to these things, it has\r\n\r\nbeen  suggested  that Malaysia will  mean  economic\r\n\r\nprosperity,  expanded markets,  greater  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities,  etc.  One would  have  expected  to\r\n\r\nfind,  in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,\r\n\r\nsome clear indication as to the future of Singapore\r\n\r\nin  the  context  of Malaysian economic  situation,\r\n\r\nespecially in view of the fact\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the Governments concerned appear determined to\r\n\r\npush  through this neo-colonial plot regardless  of\r\n\r\nthe   strong  opposition  of  the  people.  To  our\r\n\r\nsurprise,  we find hardly any reference. There  are\r\n\r\nonly  two  insignificant references in the  speech.\r\n\r\nOne  is at column 7. There is only one line. It  is\r\n\r\nso   insignificant  that  I  cannot  even  spot  it\r\n\r\nstraightaway. The last paragraph reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The establishment of Malaysia on 31st August this\r\n\r\nyear  will  give an added impetus to our industrial\r\n\r\ngrowth.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>A meaningless statement which is general and vague.\r\n\r\nAnother  reference is at column 8: \"With  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nour  opportunities will be greater.\" Sir, these are\r\n\r\nthe  only  two references, and you will  note  that\r\n\r\nthese are completely bankrupt statements which mean\r\n\r\nabsolutely  nothing. They are merely high-sounding.\r\n\r\nWhat we would like to know is, how will there be an\r\n\r\nincrease   in   industrial   growth   and   greater\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  the  context  of  Malaysia,   as\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the Government of the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya  and  the  P.A.P.? We  would  like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether there will he an automatic expanded  market\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of Malaysia. We would like  to  know\r\n\r\nwhether   goods   manufactured  in  Singapore,   on\r\n\r\nentering the Federation of Malaya, will he  subject\r\n\r\nto  tax  after Malaysia, as is the practice at  the\r\n\r\nmoment.  We  would like to know whether Federation-manufactured goods will continue to enter Singapore\r\n\r\ntax-free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the eve of the neo-colonial British-sponsored Malaysia which the P.A.P. whole-heartedly\r\n\r\nsupport,   we  still  have  no  answers  to   these\r\n\r\nquestions.  The P.A.P. lie has been  that  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwill mean greater employment opportunities. This is\r\n\r\na  falsehood  propounded by  P.A.P. propagandists.\r\n\r\nBecause of the inequality and discrimination in the\r\n\r\ncitizenship status within Malaysia, which adversely\r\n\r\naffect Singapore citizens, they will not be able to\r\n\r\nhave employment in the Federation of Malaya or  the\r\n\r\nBorneo   territories.  How  then  will   there   be\r\n\r\nincreased employment opportunities?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another lie is that Malaysia will mean a\r\n\r\nmarket   of   10  million  people  for   Singapore-manufactured goods. So far, there has been no clear\r\n\r\nstatement on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis.  As  far  as  we can understand,  even  after\r\n\r\nMalaysia, the present practice will continue,  that\r\n\r\nis,   Singapore-manufactured  goods  entering   the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya will be subject to tax, whilst\r\n\r\nFederation-manufactured  goods  will  continue   to\r\n\r\nenter Singapore tax-free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\non 31st October, 1961, we were told in column 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Without economic co-operation and a common market\r\n\r\nbetween Singapore and the Federation, there can  be\r\n\r\nlittle  hope  of  a  rapid economic  expansion  and\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  that will bring  more  factories\r\n\r\nand more jobs for the thousands of our young people\r\n\r\nleaving our schools and seeking employment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>In  1961, the P.A.P. admitted that without a common\r\n\r\nmarket  between  Singapore and  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nMalaya, there was little hope. Up to date, Sir,  as\r\n\r\nfar as we know, there is no concomitant arrangement\r\n\r\nfor  the  setting up of a common market of  Malaya,\r\n\r\nSingapore and the Borneo territories, in  spite  of\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that they are on the verge of bulldozing\r\n\r\nthrough  Malaysia. Sir, in the absence of this,  it\r\n\r\nis reasonable to expect that conditions will remain\r\n\r\nthe same, in the 31st October, 1961 speech, we were\r\n\r\nalso told in column 12:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on\r\n\r\nwhich   the  original  economic  policies  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment were based must be reviewed.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>It  is now 1\ufffd years since this speech was made.  In\r\n\r\nthe speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara this year,\r\n\r\nwe  still find not even an indication of the  basis\r\n\r\non  which Government's economic policies are to  be\r\n\r\nreviewed and devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, even assuming\r\n\r\nthat  some arrangements will be worked out,  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary for us to bear in mind the state  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy  of the Federation of Malaya as it is  now.\r\n\r\nThe   economy   of  Malaya,  as  it  is   presently\r\n\r\nconstituted, can hardly be relied on.  The  Malayan\r\n\r\neconomy  is almost totally dependent on rubber  and\r\n\r\ntin,  whose  export  markets  fluctuate.  This  has\r\n\r\ncaused  serious  disturbances in the  past  and  no\r\n\r\ndoubt  will  continue to cause  much  more  serious\r\n\r\ndisruption  in  the future. The Government  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya recognise the seriousness  of\r\n\r\ntheir over-dependence on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  two commodities and they are now engaged  in\r\n\r\nattempts to speed up industrialisation, However, in\r\n\r\nthe   field   of  industrialisation,  a   realistic\r\n\r\nappraisal  shows that the rate of progress  in  the\r\n\r\nFederation of Malaya is insufficient even  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  growing  demands  of  the  population  of  the\r\n\r\nFederation   of   Malaya,  let  alone   the   whole\r\n\r\npopulation of the Malaysia region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P., which was elected on a socialist\r\n\r\nplatform as a Left-wing Party, makes no mention  of\r\n\r\nits  economic  policies outside the status  quo  of\r\n\r\ncolonial and free enterprise economic system.

We can better appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  real  strength and weaknesses  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nadministration during the last four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, four years ago, when His Excellency the Yang\r\n\r\ndi-Pertuan  Negara made his first speech  here,  he\r\n\r\nsaid   that  the  prime  task  of  the  new  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  would  be  to build  up  a  climate  of\r\n\r\nconfidence   under   which  trade   expansion   and\r\n\r\nindustrial growth could take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following year, on 29th September, 1960,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance, in his  Budget  speech,\r\n\r\nreferred   to  the  rapid  population   growth   in\r\n\r\nSingapore    and   the   prospect    of    mounting\r\n\r\nunemployment,  and said that the Government  viewed\r\n\r\nthis with grave anxiety and would strain itself  to\r\n\r\nthe  utmost  to avoid this situation of  increasing\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we agree wholeheartedly with the P.A.P. in\r\n\r\nthese  two major objectives. Here at least are  two\r\n\r\nmilestones  by  which  we can  measure  Singapore's\r\n\r\nprogress during the P.A.P. administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when I listened to and read again the\r\n\r\nspeech of His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara\r\n\r\nthis year, I found that there was a strange silence\r\n\r\non  these  two major aims, except a bare  reference\r\n\r\nthat  new  factories would give more  jobs  to  the\r\n\r\npeople. When we examine the situation more closely,\r\n\r\nwe  find the real damaging truth: in spite of their\r\n\r\ngood intentions, the achievements and the hard work\r\n\r\nof  the P.A.P. leaders, they have failed to achieve\r\n\r\nsuccess  in these two major aims which they  stated\r\n\r\nto  be theirs in 1959. They have not only failed to\r\n\r\nbuild up the climate of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence  but  they  have  also  aggravated   the\r\n\r\nproblem of mounting unemployment. In fact, it would\r\n\r\nbe  true to say that the situation has deteriorated\r\n\r\nsince 1959 as regards these two major aims and that\r\n\r\nif it were not for the timely prospect of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe deterioration would have been even worse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice that the Barisan speakers have also\r\n\r\nbeen   crowing  over  the  failure  of  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  solve the problem of  unemployment,\r\n\r\nbut  they  must realise that they have  to  take  a\r\n\r\ngreat  portion of that blame. Basically,  both  the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. and  the  Barisan  have  made   the   same\r\n\r\nfundamental mistake in their policy, and  that  is,\r\n\r\nthey  think  they  can build a  better  society  in\r\n\r\nSingapore    by   fomenting   class   hatred    and\r\n\r\nperpetuating the class struggle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they also take delight in inflicting on the\r\n\r\npeople    of    Singapore    their    confrontation\r\n\r\ntactics - confrontation in the schools, confrontation\r\n\r\nin   factories,  confrontation  in   the   offices,\r\n\r\nconfrontation  in the Singapore Harbour  Board  and\r\n\r\nconfrontation in the Assembly. In an atmosphere  of\r\n\r\nconfrontation  almost  everywhere,  with   students\r\n\r\nbeing roused up against teachers, employees against\r\n\r\nemployers,  one  group  of  trade  unions   against\r\n\r\nanother  group, how can we expect a better  society\r\n\r\nto emerge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us have forgotten the lesson we learnt\r\n\r\nwhen we were young in school: whatever we sow, that\r\n\r\nshall we reap. How can we sow hatred and expect  to\r\n\r\nreap  something good? We must then expect  to  reap\r\n\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that there are able men in both the\r\n\r\nBarisan and the P.A.P., and if they can only  purge\r\n\r\nthemselves  of  this hatred of class against  class\r\n\r\nand  race  against race and person against  person,\r\n\r\nthey will be in a better position to give Singapore\r\n\r\nthat better society that we all aim for, and a more\r\n\r\npeaceful and prosperous Singapore. We can only hope\r\n\r\nthat  in  Malaysia we shall take not  the  road  of\r\n\r\nhatred  but of goodwill and continuing co-operation\r\n\r\nto build something better. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P. has produced a very good show-piece in the Jurong industrial scheme, but unless\r\n\r\nthere is a climate of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconfidence with justice and fair play, not only for\r\n\r\nthe workers, but also for the investors, the scheme\r\n\r\nmay  turn  out  to be just one big white  elephant.\r\n\r\nThat  is  the opinion of many who have a  stake  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's  future.  For why  should  foreign  and\r\n\r\nlocal  investors be asked to put in investments  in\r\n\r\nthe Jurong scheme if the Party in power claims as a\r\n\r\nmatter  of  policy  that in any  dispute  it  would\r\n\r\nalways  be on the side of the have-nots? The people\r\n\r\nwho  are  the  haves will be fools if they  put  in\r\n\r\nmoney  in order to lose their investments. But  why\r\n\r\nshould  it be so? Why should it not be justice  for\r\n\r\nall?  Why  should we not let common sense  prevail\r\n\r\nover  any  personal  hatred  or  class  hatred,  or\r\n\r\nrancour  that may be in our hearts? This deliberate\r\n\r\nencouragement  of one class against  another  class\r\n\r\nmay  win  for one side some votes, but in the  long\r\n\r\nrun it brings mutual destruction to both sides; not\r\n\r\nonly to the haves but also to the have-nots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask both the Barisan and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. who the real have-nots are in Singapore.  To\r\n\r\nme,  Sir, the real have-nots in Singapore  are  the\r\n\r\nunemployed.   Those  in  employment  already   have\r\n\r\nsomething. They have something to live on, to build\r\n\r\non.  The unemployed are the real have-nots, and the\r\n\r\npeople  who  have done the greatest disservice  and\r\n\r\nthe greatest harm to the have-nots in Singapore,  I\r\n\r\nam sorry to say, have been both the Barisan and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P. with their confrontation tactics. The result\r\n\r\nhas  been that we have less and less jobs for  more\r\n\r\nand more have-nots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this situation has been borne out by the\r\n\r\nreport  published in 1960 of the Labour  Department\r\n\r\nunder the P.A.P. administration. In September 1957,\r\n\r\nthere  were  123,000 workmen in  employment.  Three\r\n\r\nyears  later in 1960 there were 7,400 less  workmen\r\n\r\nin  employment. In September 1961, according to the\r\n\r\nDigest  of  Statistics, the  total  number  of  men\r\n\r\nemployed  in  all  industries was still  less  than\r\n\r\n110,000.  So,  since  1957, when  the  P.A.P. took\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the  City  Council,  the  climate   of\r\n\r\nconfidence in Singapore has deteriorated,  and  the\r\n\r\nnumber of jobs available for the have-nots has been\r\n\r\nless and less, so that today there are 13,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nless  jobs  for  the have-nots than  in  1957.  The\r\n\r\nnumber   of  unemployed,  the  real  have-nots   in\r\n\r\nSingapore,  has probably increased from  60,000  in\r\n\r\n1959,  at,  say, an average of 20,000  a  year,  to\r\n\r\nabout 140,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the tragedy that the Barisan and the\r\n\r\nP.A.P.,  who  claim to be the loudest champions  of\r\n\r\nthe  have-nots, have been the ones who have  caused\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  suffering to the real  have-nots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore - the unemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only both the Barisan and the P.A.P.,\r\n\r\nwould  try a new approach to the problem of helping\r\n\r\nthe   have-nots  in  Singapore,  rather  than   the\r\n\r\nconfrontation approach they have been  trying  out,\r\n\r\nvery   likely  there  would  be  this  climate   of\r\n\r\nconfidence coming to Singapore and we would produce\r\n\r\nmore  and  more  jobs  for the  real  have-nots  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not even have to wait for new factories to\r\n\r\nproduce  new jobs. The present enterprises and  the\r\n\r\npresent  factories  are  capable  of  expansion  to\r\n\r\nprovide  the  new  jobs,  provided  there  is   the\r\n\r\nassurance  that  there will  be  justice  for  both\r\n\r\nsides,  both the workers and the employers, in  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the citizens of Singapore and  of  the\r\n\r\ntrue have-nots, the jobless of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the P.A.P. looks forward to\r\n\r\nMalaysia  as  the  hope for  a  better  future  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens, but if we carry into  Malaysia\r\n\r\nthe  old approach of fomenting class hatred and the\r\n\r\nclass struggle, then we shall he carrying into  the\r\n\r\nnew  Malaysia the disease from the old, and instead\r\n\r\nof  producing  more jobs and a better  climate,  we\r\n\r\nwill  simply produce more suffering for  the  have-nots.  In fact in Sabah, North Borneo, the  leaders\r\n\r\nare  scared of the people from Singapore. They say,\r\n\r\n\"You fellows are such trouble makers that we do not\r\n\r\nwant you here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are short of labour and we have plenty\r\n\r\nof  unemployed in Singapore, and yet  they  do  not\r\n\r\nwant  the  unemployed of Singapore because  of  the\r\n\r\npoison  that has been put into their hearts,  minds\r\n\r\nand souls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that I am being idealistic,\r\n\r\nbut  let us look back to the period in 1946 to 1948\r\n\r\nin Malaya. There\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  then a conflict of two principles. There  were\r\n\r\nsome  who said that the Chinese in Malaya  must  be\r\n\r\norganised  to  oppose the Malays,  and  there  were\r\n\r\nothers  who said that the Malays in Malaya must  be\r\n\r\norganised   to   oppose  the  Chinese.   That   was\r\n\r\nconfrontation,  Sir. There were  others  who  said,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  the  Chinese  in  Malaya  must   be\r\n\r\norganised  to co-operate with the Malays  to  build\r\n\r\nsomething  better  for Malaya,  a  new  nation  for\r\n\r\nMalaya,  and  we  are glad to say that  there  were\r\n\r\namong the leaders of the Malays those who said that\r\n\r\nthe Malays must be organised to co-operate with the\r\n\r\nChinese and the other non-Malays to build something\r\n\r\nbetter.  I am glad that those leaders who  believed\r\n\r\nnot  in  confrontation  but co-operation,  with  no\r\n\r\nthought of stabbing their partners in the hack, won\r\n\r\nthe day. Therefore, Malaya today is able to rejoice\r\n\r\nin  having a country where there is racial harmony,\r\n\r\nwhere there is a genuine spirit of co-operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia is only an extension of that spirit of co-operation. To me, that is only something symbolic\r\n\r\nof  what the United Nations should be in the world.\r\n\r\nIt  is  something of which Indonesia  need  not  be\r\n\r\nafraid.  If  in Malaysia we organise to  co-operate\r\n\r\nwith one another, and we are prepared to co-operate\r\n\r\nwith   Indonesia,   with  the   Philippines,   with\r\n\r\nThailand, and with the other nations of the  world,\r\n\r\nwe  are not a danger to the others. We will only he\r\n\r\ntoo  happy to produce the right climate.  We  shall\r\n\r\neventually  see  greater world  peace  and  greater\r\n\r\nworld unity. Sir, this is something altogether  new\r\n\r\nfor my colleagues in the P.A.P. and in the Barisan,\r\n\r\nbut  I do appeal to them, for the sake of Malaysia,\r\n\r\nto try this new approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to more mundane subject and\r\n\r\ncongratulate  the  Minister for Finance  on  having\r\n\r\nbecome  a successful State capitalist. He has  been\r\n\r\nable  to  report a great increase in the  financial\r\n\r\nreserves  of the State - over $200 million.  At  this\r\n\r\npoint, however, we must become conscious of a  duty\r\n\r\nthat has not been completely fulfilled - that a small\r\n\r\nportion  of  that money was accumulated  under  the\r\n\r\nmisapprehension that the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncountry  was facing a serious deficit in  1959.  It\r\n\r\nhas  since  turned out that there was a surplus  in\r\n\r\n1959,  and a bigger surplus in 1960, and there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  a  surplus every year since then, as was  the\r\n\r\ncase  even before 1959. So, naturally, the question\r\n\r\narises, if the P.A.P. Government are good employers\r\n\r\nand  believe in the integrity of honest  employers,\r\n\r\nshould  they  not now fully restore  the  pay  cuts\r\n\r\ndeducted   in   1959?  And  they  have   tremendous\r\n\r\nresources  now.  This  has  now  become  conscience\r\n\r\nmoney.  That amount wrongfully deducted belongs  to\r\n\r\nthe  rightful owners - the civil servants  now  under\r\n\r\nthe  care of the P.A.P. and the refund can be  done\r\n\r\nin  a  way  without  damaging the  economy  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the field of education I am glad that the\r\n\r\nGovernment has been able to build enough schools to\r\n\r\nadmit all the Primary I pupils. I am glad also that\r\n\r\nthe  compulsory six-day week, a very  controversial\r\n\r\nissue,  has  been satisfactorily settled  and  many\r\n\r\nparents  and children have been made happy  thereby\r\n\r\nwithout  the  examination results  being  adversely\r\n\r\naffected. We have heard also that there has been  a\r\n\r\nrapid increase in enrolment in the schools, but the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education has admitted that there  has\r\n\r\nbeen  some sacrifice in regard to quality. In  many\r\n\r\nschools  parents are frustrated because there  have\r\n\r\nbeen  too many failures. I trust the Government  in\r\n\r\nthe  coming  months will carefully look  into  this\r\n\r\naspect  of education to improve on the quality  and\r\n\r\nnot concentrate on quantity alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have before me here a copy of a Singapore\r\n\r\nGovernment  Press statement issued on  21st  March,\r\n\r\n1963. It begins with the following words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As the result of the Prime Minister's visits to\r\n\r\nthe rural constituencies of Singapore.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I repeat, Sir:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"As the result of the Prime Minister's visits to\r\n\r\nthe rural constituencies of Singapore, an extensive\r\n\r\nrural  electrification programme has been  prepared\r\n\r\nso  that  the  wishes of the kampong  dwellers  for\r\n\r\nelectricity in their houses will come true.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this report is accurate and the inference\r\n\r\nis  accurate, the implication then is that  if  the\r\n\r\nrural  dwellers  want to have  any  improvement  in\r\n\r\ntheir kampongs, they must wait until the Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  has  visited  them,  and  if  the   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister does not visit them, they will miss  their\r\n\r\nshare  of the $30 million Development Fund that  is\r\n\r\ngoing  to  be spent in the rural areas. Further - and\r\n\r\nthis   is   a   more  serious  implication - if   the\r\n\r\nconstituents  in  any particular division  are  not\r\n\r\nwilling  to  welcome  the  Prime  Minister  or  are\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Party  in power, then  they  will  be\r\n\r\ndeprived  of  what would have been their  share  of\r\n\r\nthis Development Fund. It is also unfortunate, Sir,\r\n\r\nthat the Prime Minister is making visits in 1963 so\r\n\r\nnear election time. People in Singapore are talking\r\n\r\nabout  it  and  saying that the Prime  Minister  is\r\n\r\ngoing  round  campaigning for the  next  elections,\r\n\r\nusing  his position and using the Development Fund.\r\n\r\nI hope the Prime Minister will give us an assurance\r\n\r\nthat even in the constituencies that he may not  be\r\n\r\nable to visit, if there is a real need and the need\r\n\r\nis  brought  to his notice or the notice  of  other\r\n\r\nMinisters, it will be given the same consideration\r\n\r\nas  requests coming from constituencies  which  the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister has visited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the  Member for  Queenstown  and  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Upper Serangoon is in two  parts.  The\r\n\r\nfirst  part alleges that the Government has  failed\r\n\r\nto  implement its election pledges, and the  second\r\n\r\npart that Government should ascertain the views -of\r\n\r\nthe   people  in  regard  to  their  constitutional\r\n\r\nfuture. I should like to deal with the second  part\r\n\r\nfirst.  There  are people who try to  forget  facts\r\n\r\nthat  prove uncomfortable and unpleasant  to  them.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will not allow them to forget that  the\r\n\r\npeople  of Singapore have already decided on  their\r\n\r\nconstitutional   future,  i.e. merger   with   the\r\n\r\nFederation  of Malaya on the basis of  White  Paper\r\n\r\nCommand  No.  33 of 1961. Over 70 per cent  of  the\r\n\r\npeople  of  Singapore  voted for  merger  with  the\r\n\r\nFederation on the basis of the White Paper. This is\r\n\r\nthe   verdict  of  the  people.  It  is  final  and\r\n\r\nconclusive.  The fact is that the two  Members,  in\r\n\r\nwhose   names  the  amendment  stands,  have   some\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  finding matters on  which  to  join\r\n\r\nissue with us, and perforce they must rake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nup old ones that have already been settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the charge that the Government has\r\n\r\nfailed to implement its election pledges, what does\r\n\r\nit  really mean? Everyone knows full well that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  carried out its  election  pledges\r\n\r\nwherever  it is humanly possible. In many instances\r\n\r\nthese pledges have been overfulfilled and in others\r\n\r\nnew  services, amenities and facilities  have  been\r\n\r\nmade available for the people of Singapore. Let  us\r\n\r\ntake   the   field  of  housing.  The  Member   for\r\n\r\nQueenstown, unless he chooses to go about with  his\r\n\r\neyes  closed,  can see in his very own constituency\r\n\r\nthe   housing   units  that  we  are  building   in\r\n\r\nincreasing  numbers day-by day. In just over  three\r\n\r\nyears, the Housing and Development Board has  built\r\n\r\n21,232  units  against 23,019 units  built  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Improvement Trust in the 32 years of  its\r\n\r\nexistence.  In 1962 alone, a total of 12,230  units\r\n\r\nwere  completed  as against the  target  figure  of\r\n\r\n9,735  units  laid  down in the  State  Development\r\n\r\nPlan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the achievement of public housing\r\n\r\nhas  exceeded  the target figure by almost  25  per\r\n\r\ncent.  We  have  pledged  to  build  more  low-cost\r\n\r\nhousing  for  the  poorer  classes  and,  in   this\r\n\r\nrespect,  with a dynamic and vigorous  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board, the target achieved has exceeded\r\n\r\nall   expectations.  Sir,  the  present  Government\r\n\r\ninherited  from the previous Singapore  Improvement\r\n\r\nTrust  a  waiting  list of 13,000 families  on  the\r\n\r\nhousing   register.  If  we  took   the   rate   of\r\n\r\nconstruction  of  the S.I.T. in post-war  years  of\r\n\r\n1,700  units per year, some of these families would\r\n\r\nhave to wait for five to eight years to get housing\r\n\r\naccommodation.  Now,  due to  the  success  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's housing development programme,  almost\r\n\r\nall the 13,000 families on the waiting list in 1959\r\n\r\nhave  been  housed, in addition to a further  8,000\r\n\r\nfamilies  who  have  newly  registered.  Altogether\r\n\r\nabout  21,000  families of the lower  income  group\r\n\r\nhave obtained low-cost housing from the development\r\n\r\nprogramme of the present Government. Yet the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown was doing his best to belittle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe achievement of the Government in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Priority in allocation of public housing is based\r\n\r\non the points system. The Government is now able to\r\n\r\nrelax   the  qualification  for  registration   and\r\n\r\ngradually bring the benefit of public housing to  a\r\n\r\nwider  range of families in Singapore.  During  the\r\n\r\nS.I.T. period, five persons was the minimum number\r\n\r\nrequired  for public housing, but the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board is now able to reduce this number\r\n\r\nto four persons for Queenstown and to three persons\r\n\r\nfor  the one-room $20 flats. Another relaxation has\r\n\r\nbeen  made on the qualifications to allow  grown-up\r\n\r\nbrothers  and sisters to be included in the  family\r\n\r\nunit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have now reached the stage where any\r\n\r\nfamily, who has the necessary qualifications and is\r\n\r\nnot particular about the choice of locality and the\r\n\r\nheight  of the floors, can obtain accommodation  in\r\n\r\nless than a month after registration. In fact,  one\r\n\r\nof  the  odd results of the rapid rate of building,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  smashed  the backbone  of  the  housing\r\n\r\nproblem, is that people are now becoming choosey as\r\n\r\nto  the locality and height of floors on which they\r\n\r\nwish  to  have accommodation. There have been  many\r\n\r\ncases  where a family has been offered and rejected\r\n\r\naccommodation several times not because they cannot\r\n\r\nafford the rent but because of the locality or  the\r\n\r\nheight of the floor. Compare this with the old days\r\n\r\nof  the  S.I.T. when the building rate  was  1,700\r\n\r\nunits  per  year  and  the  poor  people  were   so\r\n\r\ndesperately  in  need  of accommodation  that  they\r\n\r\ngrasped with eagerness any accommodation offered to\r\n\r\nthem  in  any locality on any floor! Truly we  have\r\n\r\nmoved forward compared with those days. Had it  not\r\n\r\nbeen  for the obstruction and intimidation  of  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  fellow-travellers in the  Rural  Residents\r\n\r\nAssociation  and the Country People's  Association,\r\n\r\nthere  would have been even more houses  built  for\r\n\r\nthe  poorer  people. Thus, by their  very  actions,\r\n\r\nthese so-called champions of the people are slowing\r\n\r\ndown  the progress of providing more law-cost homes\r\n\r\nfor the lower income people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have been pressing ahead with the housing\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  we  have  not  forgotten  the  social\r\n\r\namenities  that  are necessary for  the  people  in\r\n\r\nthese  housing estates. As an illustration, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  Queenstown  which  is  our  largest\r\n\r\nestate.  Our plans are to build a total  of  17,500\r\n\r\nunits  to  house 150,000 people. 11,000 units  have\r\n\r\nbeen   completed,   and  6,000   more   are   under\r\n\r\nconstruction. There are six shopping centres: three\r\n\r\nhave  been  built  and  the  other  three  will  be\r\n\r\ncompleted   this  year.  Two  cinemas   are   under\r\n\r\nconstruction. A large Polyclinic was completed  and\r\n\r\nopened   early  this  year.  In  addition  to   the\r\n\r\ncommunity centre already built, we will be building\r\n\r\nthree more. Of the five markets planned, three have\r\n\r\nbeen   completed.   A  police  station   is   being\r\n\r\nconstructed  and there are plans to  build  a  post\r\n\r\noffice.  Many children's play grounds are scattered\r\n\r\nover the estate and there is a provision for a  13-acre public park. Of course, there are schools  for\r\n\r\nthe  children's  education.  In  addition  to  five\r\n\r\nprimary  schools and three secondary  schools  that\r\n\r\nare  now  functioning, we are going to build  three\r\n\r\nmore primary and four secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have solved the housing problem to such an\r\n\r\nextent that we are now able to devote our attention\r\n\r\nto  the  much bigger problem of the city  area  re-development. We know that, in the city area  alone,\r\n\r\nthere are some half a million people living in very\r\n\r\ncongested,  unhealthy  and  terribly  rickety   old\r\n\r\nhouses. For various reasons, many of them prefer to\r\n\r\nstay  in the city area rather than apply for public\r\n\r\nhousing  on the outskirts of the town. A start  has\r\n\r\nbeen  made  in the Cantonment Road area. Work  will\r\n\r\nstart  later in the Sumbawa Road area.  We  realise\r\n\r\nthis  task is one of tremendous magnitude  but  the\r\n\r\nprospects of a revitalised city worthy of our State\r\n\r\nis  an exciting one. We are pressing ahead with the\r\n\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like now to mention briefly the various\r\n\r\nother  construction projects which  the  Government\r\n\r\nhas  carried out and will continue to carry out for\r\n\r\nthe benefit of the people. Let me take flood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalleviation  works. Singapore is  generally  a  low\r\n\r\nlying country. When heavy rains coincide with  high\r\n\r\ntides, the low lying areas are subject to flooding.\r\n\r\nThe  rapid  increase  in  building  activities  and\r\n\r\nlevelling of hills increase the rate of run-off and\r\n\r\nmake  flood  control quite a difficult problem.  In\r\n\r\nsome  cases, these alleviation works prevent damage\r\n\r\nto  properties  and  farms and, in  others,  reduce\r\n\r\ninconvenience to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the $3 million Ulu Pandan Flood\r\n\r\nAlleviation Scheme is proceeding under full  steam.\r\n\r\nThis   scheme  envisages  the  reversal  of   flow,\r\n\r\ndiverting  water from the area near Queen's  Circus\r\n\r\ntowards the west, instead of towards the east as at\r\n\r\npresent.  The  triple  culvert  near  Tanglin  Halt\r\n\r\nindustrial estate was completed in 1962.  When  the\r\n\r\nwhole scheme is completed, drainage in the Redhill,\r\n\r\nAlexandra  Road and Queenstown area  will  be  very\r\n\r\nmuch  improved  and the danger of floods  occurring\r\n\r\nthere  will be greatly reduced. The last  drain  in\r\n\r\nthe  Radin  Mas area is now almost completed.  This\r\n\r\nwill  benefit the residents in the low-lying  areas\r\n\r\nin Alexandra Road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1962, the concrete drain between Bartley\r\n\r\nand  MacPherson Roads was completed. This  year,  a\r\n\r\nfurther  stretch of drain towards Paya  Lebar  Road\r\n\r\nwill  be  constructed. Drainage  in  the  low-lying\r\n\r\nkampong  between Bartley Road and Paya  Lebar  Road\r\n\r\nwill  be greatly improved. The drainage works  from\r\n\r\nMandai Road to Woodlands Road and the scheme at the\r\n\r\n5th  milestone at Pasir Panjang Road is now  almost\r\n\r\ncompleted.  Work will begin soon on the Chong  Pang\r\n\r\nVillage drain at Sembawang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, the Government will concentrate on the\r\n\r\nconcrete  lining of the important canals,  such  as\r\n\r\nthe Kallang, Geylang, Rochore and Alexandra Canals.\r\n\r\nConcrete  lining  will not only improve  the  water\r\n\r\nflow  but also facilitate cleansing and maintenance\r\n\r\nof these canals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total expenditure on flood alleviation under\r\n\r\nthe Four-Year Plan will amount to $10 million.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in carrying out construction of more houses,\r\n\r\nschools, clinics, roads, shopping centres and flood\r\n\r\nalleviation  schemes,  more and  more  workers  are\r\n\r\nrequired.  Already thousands and thousands  in  the\r\n\r\nrank   of   the  unemployed  are  finding   gainful\r\n\r\nemployment. Yet the Member for Queenstown and other\r\n\r\nOpposition  Members allege that the Government  has\r\n\r\nnot tried to tackle the question of unemployment. I\r\n\r\nam quite sure they are not in their right senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of animal husbandry, agriculture and\r\n\r\nfisheries,  we have provided services and  we  will\r\n\r\nprovide  even more services as we go on.  The  fact\r\n\r\nthat we have a healthy and vigorous export trade in\r\n\r\nchickens and eggs, and to a lesser degree  in  pigs\r\n\r\nbecause  of  restrictions, bear  testimony  to  the\r\n\r\nefforts  of  the Government in providing  more  and\r\n\r\nbetter  services for our people in the rural areas.\r\n\r\nProtection  against ranikhet disease  today  is  no\r\n\r\nlonger  confined  to  the  adult  birds  but   also\r\n\r\nextended   to  day-old  chicks.  Thus,  we   render\r\n\r\ncomprehensive protection against poultry  diseases.\r\n\r\nAt  present,  more than 15,000 day-old chicks  amid\r\n\r\n30,000  adult poultry are vaccinated by  Government\r\n\r\nevery  day.  In 1962 alone, a total of 11\ufffd  million\r\n\r\nchickens  were vaccinated against ranikhet  disease\r\n\r\nas compared with 6.2 million chickens vaccinated in\r\n\r\n1958 and 6.7 million in 1959. We have extended  the\r\n\r\nstud  boar  service to provide good  boars  and  to\r\n\r\nimprove  the  strains  of  pigs  produced  by   our\r\n\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we even have artificial insemination for pigs.\r\n\r\nThus many more farmers can receive the benefits  of\r\n\r\nhaving  good pig strains. Apart from Japan, Russia,\r\n\r\nNorway  and  one  or  two other European  countries\r\n\r\nwhich    have   already   been   using   artificial\r\n\r\ninsemination techniques in the breedings  of  pigs,\r\n\r\nthe introduction of artificial insemination service\r\n\r\nfor pigs on a commercial scale here makes Singapore\r\n\r\nthe  first  tropical country in Asia to adopt  this\r\n\r\nmodern scientific technique in pig breeding  on  an\r\n\r\nextensive  scale,  apart  from  Japan  which  is  a\r\n\r\ntemperate  country. With this service  the  farmers\r\n\r\nnot only are able to obtain good stock, to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduce  good piglings, but also save a great  deal of  \r\n\r\ntime  and  money  by  simply  telephoning  the Artificial\r\n\r\nInsemination Unit which will immediately send  out teams to \r\n\r\ncarry out the services on  their farms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone beyond\r\n\r\nour election  pledges  by building three veterinary extension \r\n\r\ncentres in  the rural areas. Two more are under construction. \r\n\r\nEach of  these centres has a veterinary surgeon, a  team of\r\n\r\nassistants permanently stationed in the areas to serve  the\r\n\r\nfarmers in that particular locality.  We have  brought to the \r\n\r\nfarmers a service for the sale of   veterinary  drugs  at  cost\r\n\r\non   their   very doorsteps.  Farmers realising the  benefit  of \r\n\r\nthe services are now increasing their purchase of drugs for  use  \r\n\r\nunder  the  guidance  of  our  veterinary officers. For example,\r\n\r\nin 1961 sales of such  drugs totalled  $64 000, and by 1962 sales \r\n\r\nhave increased to  $80,000.  We  are continuing  research  in  the\r\n\r\nproduction  of  improved chicks  and  piglings  for distribution \r\n\r\nto farmers. Last year 47,000  day-old chicks of improved straw were \r\n\r\nsold at the specially reduced  price of 20 cents each. At the same \r\n\r\ntime, 425 piglings were also distributed at $1 per katty. These \r\n\r\nimproved breeds of piglings and  chicks  are produced   from \r\n\r\ncarefully  selected  stock   after considerable research work \r\n\r\nand are for the  purpose of upgrading and improving the quality of\r\n\r\nlivestock in Singapore. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is aware of the Government's effort\r\n\r\nto maintain outlets for the produce of our farmers  in the  \r\n\r\nFederation.  The  successful  result  of  our representations to\r\n\r\nthe Federation Government in the matter of restrictions on our chickens\r\n\r\nand eggs  is only  an  example of our efforts in this direction.\r\n\r\nFor  about  two  months, the  Prime  Minister,  the Minister  for \r\n\r\nFinance and I  paid  visits  to  the Federal capital to seek a \r\n\r\nsatisfactory solution  to the  problem of restrictions. Our \r\n\r\nfarmers are aware that  during  the later stage of negotiations,\r\n\r\nthe Singapore  Government had to resort to  restricting the   \r\n\r\nimport  of  vegetables  and  fish  from   the Federation. \r\n\r\nThese   endeavours    have    proved successful. Since the \r\n\r\n15th February  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis  year,  our chickens and  eggs  can  move freely \r\n\r\ninto the Federation without payment of  any licence fee. \r\n\r\nThe free movement of piglings and sows will   continue.  I  have\r\n\r\nbeen  assured  by   the Federation   Minister  for  Agriculture \r\n\r\nand   Co-operatives  that,  after  merger,  there  will \r\n\r\nhe completely free movement for all Singapore-produced pigs,\r\n\r\nbe they pigs for breeding or for slaughter.  I am  glad  to say that \r\n\r\nchicken and egg prices  which were depressed when the Federation\r\n\r\nrestriction came into force have now recovered. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will\r\n\r\nremember that I reported  to  this Assembly sometime ago that the \r\n\r\nGovernment initiated a  scheme  in  the Southern Islands  to  \r\n\r\ndistribute goats  free of charge in order to assist the  Malay \r\n\r\nfishermen  there  to  diversify  their  sources  of income  and\r\n\r\nto improve their livelihood. The  goats which  have been distributed\r\n\r\nhave been successfully reared by the Malay fishermen and a number \r\n\r\nof  kids born  to  these  goats have been  returned  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment for further distribution to other  Malay fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe male goats - the Member  for  Geylang Serai  mentioned  earlier - helped  to  make  this possible. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to increase the\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  animal disease  control, the Government will \r\n\r\nestablish  a veterinary  diagnostic  laboratory  to  carry  \r\n\r\nout investigation of various livestock diseases in  the State, \r\n\r\nso  that control measures can be instituted against  such diseases. \r\n\r\nThese measures will  reduce farmers'  losses from diseases and\r\n\r\nthereby  assist them  directly to obtain better returns  for \r\n\r\ntheir labour. We will introduce a meat inspection service and \r\n\r\nprovide  new slaughter facilities  of  a  high standard so that \r\n\r\nmeat and meat products produced in the  State  can  be  exported\r\n\r\nto  other  countries. Towards this end, plans for the building of \r\n\r\na  new modern  abattoir are being finalised. Once the  new abattoir \r\n\r\nis established, it will not only encourage the  food  processing\r\n\r\nindustries in the  State  but will  also  benefit our farmers\r\n\r\nby  providing  them with a ready market for their products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of agriculture, we are continuing our tractor\r\n\r\nservice to provide our farmers with  cheap service at $20\r\n\r\nper acre. We are helping our farmers to  combat  the many\r\n\r\nagricultural pests encountered in  vegetable  and food production \r\n\r\nby carrying  out the  plant  protection service whereby farmers \r\n\r\ncan ask  the  Government to spray their vegetables  and fruits \r\n\r\nwith insecticides at low cost. We will  also be  making  available \r\n\r\nto the farmers  a  number  of insecticides   and  fungicides   at\r\n\r\nlow   prices. Following  a  series of successful  experiments \r\n\r\non fertilizers, the Government is selling a cheap  and yet \r\n\r\neffective fertilizer mixture to  the  farmers. This   fertilizer \r\n\r\nmixture  has  been   very   well received.  The  farmers  \r\n\r\nare purchasing  increasing quantities.  At present, we are also\r\n\r\nstudying  the possibility  of  supplying  farmers  with  improved\r\n\r\nvegetable seeds as well as fruit planting materials such as rambutan\r\n\r\nbud grafts and flower cuttings  in order to assist them to obtain a\r\n\r\nhigher income.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, we successfully reclaimed\r\n\r\nsome agricultural land, a fish pond and a prawn pond  at Sungei \r\n\r\nPoyang.  The reclaimed land  is  now  under process  of  \r\n\r\ndesalinisation and, when completed  in the  next few months, \r\n\r\nwill be used for resettlement purposes.  The  Government is\r\n\r\ninitiating  a  pilot scheme  in  this area to help organise farmers \r\n\r\nand fishermen  to  form a primary produce  co-operative society  for \r\n\r\nthe purpose of running the  ponds  and fish  ponds and to market the\r\n\r\nproduce of the  farms as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inshore fishing areas of Singapore\r\n\r\nare already fished  to  the limit, and it is now necessary  for our  \r\n\r\nfishermen  to look towards the offshore  areas for extension of\r\n\r\nactivities. The Government has had some  success in encouraging\r\n\r\nsome private companies to  extend  offshore  deep-sea  operations  \r\n\r\nand  to undertake the training of local personnel.  We  are also  \r\n\r\nconsidering the establishment of an  offshore fishery school. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have established a primary production extension service for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  solving   specific problems  and  difficulties \r\n\r\nencountered   by   the farmers  and fishermen. Field officers  bring\r\n\r\nback from  the rural areas the problems faced by farmers and\r\n\r\nfishermen. Technical officers  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill then devise solutions to overcome the specific difficulties. \r\n\r\nThe extension service  will  also  be engaged  in  the  dissemination\r\n\r\nof  scientific  and technical information to the farmers. Towards \r\n\r\nthis end,  films  are being produced on the subjects  of agriculture, \r\n\r\nanimal husbandry  and  fisheries  for showing  to farmers in\r\n\r\nthe villages in the evening, and  thus bring to them the latest \r\n\r\ndevelopments and improvements in farming and fishing techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the establishment of a large number of community centres\r\n\r\nin  the  rural  areas,  primary production  services  are  being\r\n\r\nprovided  through these centres, bringing these services to the \r\n\r\nvery doorsteps  of  the farmers. If I may  say  so,  the extremely\r\n\r\nwide range and comprehensive  nature  of services that we bring to our \r\n\r\nfarmers and fishermen in  the  rural areas is without parallel in \r\n\r\nSouth-East Asia.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, Sir, everyone in Singapore knows\r\n\r\nthat the Government has carried out its election pledges wherever\r\n\r\nit is humanly possible. In many instances, these  pledges  have \r\n\r\nbeen over-fulfilled  and,  in others, new services, amenities and \r\n\r\nfacilities have been  made available for the people in the city\r\n\r\nas well as the rural area.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No Member wishes to speak?\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was expecting the\r\n\r\nOpposition to speak after  we  have spoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nwe have heard a great deal from the  Member for Queenstown, \r\n\r\nthe Member for  Thomson and  also the Member for Hong Lim. I\r\n\r\nfind there was nothing  constructive at all in their speeches  and \r\n\r\nsome of them were actually very destructive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim\r\n\r\nmust be still day-dreaming of  his Ong Eng Guan empire during \r\n\r\nthe City Council days   when  he  mentioned  that  not  one   single\r\n\r\nconstituency is a safe seat for the P.A.P.  Only  a very  arrogant \r\n\r\nman will dare make  such  a  daring statement,  and  I  believe  that \r\n\r\nthis   type   of statement  was made in desperation. If \r\n\r\nthe  Member for  Hong Lim is not careful, he may even lose  \r\n\r\nhis own seat in 1964. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to the Member for Queenstown who seemed to be indulging in fanciful imagination. First of all, not only were his allegations false but some of them were even factually groundless. He mentioned the National Theatre. Sir. He alleged that the Government was paying overtime to rush the\r\n\r\ntheatre  into  completion. He  forgets  the  simple procedure that\r\n\r\nonce a contract is let out, it is up to  the contractor to complete \r\n\r\nthe job when he  has accepted  the  date.  He  alleged  that  a  lot  \r\n\r\nof pressure  was  put on the builders to complete  the theatre. \r\n\r\nI  would remind him to go back  and  read some of the newspapers \r\n\r\nabout the contract that  had been   given  for  the  building  of \r\n\r\nthe  National Theatre,   which  was  built  to  commemorate   \r\n\r\nthe attainment  of  self-government of  Singapore.  The theatre\r\n\r\nwas made possible because of the  generous contributions of the\r\n\r\npeople of Singapore  and  with the  co-operation of the Government.  \r\n\r\nTenders  were called  and  we  gave  a  definite  date  for  \r\n\r\nthe completion  of  the  theatre. As  Chairman  of  the theatre, \r\n\r\nSir, it is my duty to see that the theatre be completed as soon\r\n\r\nas possible so that the people who  have  contributed  the  money \r\n\r\nwould  not   be disappointed.  Singapore is a place of  efficiency. \r\n\r\nWe  want  things done quickly, and I  am  surprised that the Member\r\n\r\nfor Queenstown would like to see  a delay  in  the completion of \r\n\r\nthe National  Theatre. Tenders  were  let  out, as I have  said, \r\n\r\nand  the target  was  the end of May. Not a single  cent  of\r\n\r\novertime   was   paid  to  the  workers   or   the contractors \r\n\r\nwho  have so kindly lived  up  to  the trust  to try to finish\r\n\r\nthe theatre by the  end  of May,  or at the latest in June. \r\n\r\nAfter that, we hope to  have  the  South-East Asia  cultural\r\n\r\nfestival. Already many countries in South-East Asia, and even \r\n\r\nfrom India and Pakistan, have agreed to participate in  this grand\r\n\r\nfestival, which is the first of  its kind in South-East Asia.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Queenstown also mentioned T.V.\r\n\r\nHe  alleged that  the  purpose  of putting up T.V. was to do P.A.P. \r\n\r\npropaganda. It  is surprising that such a wonderful propaganda machine is  \r\n\r\nnot being used by the Member for Queenstown. He has \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  repeatedly invited not only over  the  radio, \r\n\r\nbut  on T.V. We invite him to T.V. and yet he fights shy  of  coming.\r\n\r\nIf  it  is  a  useful  propaganda machine, he should make good use of\r\n\r\nit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to education, Sir, he has alleged that the recent arrests\r\n\r\nhave something to do with the  Torch campaign  which was organised\r\n\r\nby their  supporters. The  Torch  campaign,  as it was  claimed,  \r\n\r\nwas  to encourage  and persuade the people of Singapore  to study\r\n\r\ntheir mother tongue. If it is the purpose  of the  campaign  to \r\n\r\npromote the study of  the  mother tongue.  We are all for it. But, \r\n\r\nSir, as you  know, we  have had experience of such campaigns which, \r\n\r\nin fact,   have  been  engineered  by  the  Communist-inspired  \r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis  for  the  purpose   of political agitation.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that the so-called  Torch campaign was a flop,\r\n\r\nbecause you  can see  that less than three dozen people attended \r\n\r\nthe opening of the campaign. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also\r\n\r\nmentioned discrimination by the Government in  our  education policy.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be perturbed at the  decrease of school children in \r\n\r\nChinese schools. I agree with him,  Sir, that it is a fact that\r\n\r\nthere has been  a decrease in the number of Singapore children  \r\n\r\ngoing to  Chinese  schools. In fact, responsible \r\n\r\nChinese educationists  in  Singapore, and particularly  the Chinese  \r\n\r\nChamber of Commerce, have been  very  much concerned  and  perturbed\r\n\r\nat  this  decrease.  The Chamber  has been receiving memoranda from \r\n\r\nvarious educational  bodies to find out the  actual  reason for\r\n\r\nthis decrease of pupils in Chinese schools. \r\n\r\nI would  like the Member for Queenstown to read \r\n\r\nsome of the memoranda submitted by the Singapore Chinese Teachers Union, \r\n\r\nwhich represent the majority of the Chinese   teachers,  as  well  as \r\n\r\nthe   Singapore Students/Parents   Association,  representing  \r\n\r\nthe majority of the parents of Chinese school children. In  the\r\n\r\nmemoranda submitted to the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce separately,\r\n\r\nthey pointed out that  one of  then  main reasons for the decrease \r\n\r\nof  school children   in   Chinese   schools   was   political\r\n\r\ninterference  and  agitation  in  Chinese  schools, particularly the middle \r\n\r\nschools. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  would go further and say that this agitation was engineered\r\n\r\nby the Barisan Sosialis. All law-abiding Chinese  students would\r\n\r\nlike an atmosphere of  calm without   political  interference  from \r\n\r\npolitical Parties  so  that  they  can concentrate  on  their studies \r\n\r\nand not indulge in examination boycotts and other   activities   which  \r\n\r\nleave   them   nowhere particularly  concerning  their  own   future. \r\n\r\nIf political Parties can leave the students  alone  to concentrate on \r\n\r\ntheir studies, we will have a better future for the future generation \r\n\r\nof this country.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also referred to Nanyang\r\n\r\nUniversity. He said, \"What have you done  to  solve the  issue?\"  The\r\n\r\nMember for Serangoon  Gardens  as well as the Member for Upper Serangoon \r\n\r\nwere members of  the  Nanyang  University Liaison  Committee  of which I\r\n\r\nwas also a member, and they are fully aware of  the  actual  reason why \r\n\r\nthe  talks  came  to  a deadlock. It is no use asking the reason when  \r\n\r\nthey know  what was the reason. We have tried our  best, Sir, \r\n\r\nwith sincerity and a spirit of compromise  to settle  the issue,\r\n\r\nbut an issue can only be settled if  there is good-will and sincerity on both\r\n\r\nsides. The  Minister  for Education has  stressed  in  his recent \r\n\r\nspeech at the Nantah Convocation  that  the Government's offer of financial\r\n\r\naid to Nantah, that is,  the same equal treatment for Nantah \r\n\r\nas we  are giving  to  the  University  of  Singapore,   still stands. \r\n\r\nThe  door  is still  open,  subject  to  a reorganisation of the University \r\n\r\naccording  to  the Nanyang  University Review Committee. We  want \r\n\r\nthe University  to  be  run by people  who  know  about universities.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown also mentioned about the unity of\r\n\r\nthe people. He lashed out  that we  have  split the unity of the people\r\n\r\nbecause  of Malaysia.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, he is  very  fond  of saying  \r\n\r\n\"unity\", \"democracy\", but his  argument  is that  the majority of the people\r\n\r\nshould follow  the minority, then only will you have unity. We held \r\n\r\na referendum  where more than 75 per cent  voted  for the  White  Paper\r\n\r\nand less than 25  per  cent  cast blank votes. And now he is accusing us \r\n\r\nof splitting the unity of the people of Singapore,  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\njust  because the 75 per cent did not toe the  line of  the  25 per cent. \r\n\r\nThat is his argument and  his logic,  which is only understandable to the\r\n\r\nBarisan Sosialis stooges.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the things that we have done in the field of\r\n\r\neducation. I would like to stress that I  find  that the speakers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the Member for Hong Lim and those Members in the Barisan,\r\n\r\nhave never mentioned this time that the P.A.P. have done nothing. \r\n\r\nI remember that on previous occasions they were  always fond of saying, \r\n\r\n\"What have  you  done? The  P.A.P. has  done nothing for  the  people  \r\n\r\nof Singapore.\"  It is significant, Sir, that  in  this Session such \r\n\r\naccusations have ceased. At least they now recognise that we have done\r\n\r\nsome things, if not many things, for the people of Singapore. It is for \r\n\r\nthe  people  of  Singapore,  and  particularly  the Member  for  Queenstown,\r\n\r\nto see for themselves  the houses  that  have sprung up. We are  a \r\n\r\nGovernment that believes in action, and not in empty slogans.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking of democracy, if there is no democracy, the Members opposite\r\n\r\nwill not be able to speak  so freely  in  this House. They have been \r\n\r\nallowed  to hold  protest  meetings, and even  intimidation  in some  cases. \r\n\r\nOur Opposition Members  are  fond  of talking  of democracy. \r\n\r\nDemocracy has not  succeeded well  in South-East Asia because Opposition \r\n\r\nleaders have abused it. They do not realise that it is  the duty  of  a\r\n\r\ngood  Opposition to give  constructive criticisms and not just destructive\r\n\r\ncriticisms.  As we  know, in a real democracy the Opposition should be  \r\n\r\nable to substantiate what they have accused, if they  say that the Government\r\n\r\nhas done this or done that.  They must be in a position to hold power \r\n\r\nto replace  the Government and to carry out what  they have  said, and not \r\n\r\njust make empty and destructive accusations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the past three\r\n\r\nyears  substantial progress  has been made in the field of  education. The \r\n\r\neducation  pyramid  is  fast  taking   shape. Firstly, the defects\r\n\r\nin the primary base have  been put  right. In the past, more than 4,000\r\n\r\npupils who were registered in 1958 for Primary I admissions in 1959 could\r\n\r\nnot  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nbe  admitted  to schools. The picture is,  however, very  different today. \r\n\r\nThere is a place  for  every child   who  registers  for  admission  in \r\n\r\nprimary schools. Only a few hundred (i.e., less than 1\ufffd per cent)  out of \r\n\r\nan annual intake of nearly 60,000  who insist  that they must be admitted \r\n\r\nto a  particular school  will  have to wait for another year  before they can\r\n\r\ngain admission. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent decision to provide six years of free\r\n\r\nprimary  education for children  between  the ages  of 6 and 14, we see the \r\n\r\nwelcome move of  many poor  parents,  especially those  living  in  rural \r\n\r\nareas,  sending their over-age children to  school; whereas  in  the past\r\n\r\nthey probably withheld  their children  from attending school because they \r\n\r\nwould have to pay a monthly fee of $2.50. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the stoppage of automatic promotion in 1959 has resulted in a\r\n\r\ngeneral improvement in the  work of  schools over the past three years. \r\n\r\nThe improved results   of  successful  primary  school   leaving examinations \r\n\r\ntestify to this welcome trend. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, once the primary base of education is firmly established,\r\n\r\nwe have to expand greatly  the secondary sector of our education pyramid. \r\n\r\nOne step taken in the right direction was the institution of post-primary \r\n\r\nclasses in 1960, which are  to  become secondary  vocational classes next \r\n\r\nyear,  when  we expect   workshop  blocks  to  be   completed   and equipment \r\n\r\ninstalled. Another decision also taken in 1960 was to have all secondary\r\n\r\nschools running on a two-session  basis.  As  a  result,  we  have   the \r\n\r\nreasonably  happy  situation  today  in  that   our secondary \r\n\r\nschool enrolment is nearly 90  per  cent higher  than that obtained in 1959, \r\n\r\nall within  the short space of three years.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid expansion in secondary school enrolment would not have\r\n\r\nbeen  possible  without   taking simultaneous  action in the large-scale  \r\n\r\nemployment of  University  graduates from  the  University  of Singapore and \r\n\r\nNanyang University, together with the successful implementation of a crash \r\n\r\nproject scheme of one  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  special in-service professional training  for nearly  300 graduates\r\n\r\nin two-language media by  our Teachers'  Training College during  the  two  \r\n\r\nyears 1960-62. Although  professional  training   of University \r\n\r\ngraduates has been turned over  to  the School  of Education in the \r\n\r\nUniversity of Singapore at  its  request, where a two-year part-time \r\n\r\ncourse is  being conducted in two-language media since the last  academic\r\n\r\nyear, the valuable experience gained by   the   professional  training  \r\n\r\nof   University graduates in the T.T.C. from 1960-62 can always \r\n\r\nbe reinstituted if need be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that more than 5,000 adults, many of whom are our teachers,\r\n\r\nhave  attained  fairly   good standards  in  public examinations in the\r\n\r\nNational Language  conducted  by the Ministry  of  Education during  the\r\n\r\nlast three years is indeed a creditable achievement, which speaks well of \r\n\r\nthe sincerity and earnestness  of our people to learn  and  propagate the \r\n\r\nuse of our National Language. Whilst we  shall in  every possible way \r\n\r\nencourage the study and  use of  our  National Language, we should at \r\n\r\nthe  same time  intensify the teaching and study of a  second language\r\n\r\nin our schools. This is the quickest  way to  break  down  language barriers \r\n\r\nwhich  are  fast tumbling  down in our many new integrated  schools.\r\n\r\nFor this year's Primary School Leaving Examination, the  second language \r\n\r\npaper will count as  one  unit like other subjects such as Mathematics or\r\n\r\nScience. That  is  why  we have decided that classes  for  a second language \r\n\r\nwill be conducted for as few as  15 pupils,  whereas  formerly the minimum \r\n\r\nrequirement was  25 pupils, bearing in mind that a normal class can  have  \r\n\r\nas many as 44 pupils. This new  formula will  mean  employment of more\r\n\r\nteachers for  second language  teaching. For example, more  teachers  of \r\n\r\nChinese language in English medium schools will  be required, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already indicated earlier the valuable part played by\r\n\r\nour  T.T.C. in   successfully implementing the crash project for the\r\n\r\nprofessional training  of University graduates in a two-language media \r\n\r\nduring  the  years 1960-62.  This  year  our T.T.C. will launch two new \r\n\r\ncourses. First, a  two-year in-service \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse for teachers with H.S.C. qualifications. For the first time, \r\n\r\nteachers with H.S.C. qualifications are being recruited on an enhanced\r\n\r\nsalary scale  of $225  per  month.  This is in  keeping  with  their higher \r\n\r\nqualifications  as compared  with  teachers with  School  Certificate \r\n\r\nqualifications  who  are recruited at $152. They will also undergo a shorter \r\n\r\ncourse  of  training, namely two years  instead  of three years previously.\r\n\r\nOn completion they will  be placed on a salary bracket of $295 instead of \r\n\r\n$240 as  hitherto. Secondly, special two-year  upgrading courses \r\n\r\nfor Malay teachers with qualifications  of Sultan Idris Training College\r\n\r\nCertificate and Malay Women   Training   College  Certificate   will \r\n\r\nbe conducted.  It is perhaps timely for me to  express my    highest  \r\n\r\nappreciation   of   the   important contributions made by our Malay\r\n\r\nteachers  in  their dedication  in  the task of nation building,  their \r\n\r\nstrenuous efforts in propagating the study  of  our National  Language, \r\n\r\nand at  the  same  time  their resolve  and  determination to  improve \r\n\r\ntheir  own professional standards. This indeed augurs well for the  future of\r\n\r\nour Malay schools and for the  rapid development  of  our  National\r\n\r\nLanguage  in  other language media schools. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise our Adult Education\r\n\r\nBoard has during  the course  of  the  last  three  years  extended  \r\n\r\nits activities  in  many ways. One prominent  extension was in the field \r\n\r\nof secondary evening classes which have  an  enrolment of about 5,000. The  \r\n\r\nBoard  has initiated   a  number  of  successful  recreational courses  as \r\n\r\nwell, and plans are in  hand  for  the institution  of workers' extension \r\n\r\nclasses  amongst trade  union  members in the near  future.  In  our efforts  \r\n\r\nto   expand  vocational   and   technical education,  we  are fortunate to \r\n\r\nreceive  valuable assistance  from  U.N.E.S.C.O. and  from  friendly \r\n\r\ncountries  like Australia, New Zealand,  Japan  and Canada   in  the \r\n\r\nway  of  provision  of   valuable equipment, technical teachers, training\r\n\r\nspecialists and  training places in specialised fields such  as machining,\r\n\r\nwelding,  arts and crafts,  educational and vocational guidance and \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  organisation  of  practical  examinations   of technical subjects.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention must be made of technical equipment estimated at nearly $2 \r\n\r\nmillion which  the Australian Government has kindly  agreed to  donate  for\r\n\r\nequipping four secondary  technical schools  and  12 secondary vocational \r\n\r\nschools.  In addition, equipment to the value of about  $200,000 has  been\r\n\r\nreceived from the Canadian Government for our  new vocational institute, the \r\n\r\nformer Balestier Junior  Trade  School,  where  craft  training   at present\r\n\r\nbeing   conducted   at   the   Singapore Polytechnic will be centralised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure Members of the House will join me in expressing our deepest\r\n\r\ngratitude to the peoples and governments  of  Australia  and  Canada  for\r\n\r\ntheir generous  contributions of technical assistance  at this important \r\n\r\nstage of our educational development to  keep  pace with the rapid \r\n\r\nindustrialisation  of Singapore.  Yet another interesting development\r\n\r\nin the  field of higher education in Singapore is  the emergence  of  \r\n\r\nthe Ngee Ann College  at  Clemenceau Avenue. This is a private institution\r\n\r\nand will  use Chinese   as   the   chief   language   medium   of\r\n\r\ninstruction.  The first 400 students  have  already been  selected  \r\n\r\nand  it  is  understood  that   the official  opening of Singapore's fifth \r\n\r\ninstitution of  higher  learning  will be  held  sometime  next month.  \r\n\r\nI am sure all of us in this House  and  the people  of  Singapore will \r\n\r\njoin us in  wishing  the sponsors all success in their endeavours. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I briefly refer to the development and construction\r\n\r\nof schools  which,  as indicated  in  the  speech of the  Yang  di-Pertuan\r\n\r\nNegara, is expected to reach $10 million this year. During the last three \r\n\r\nand a half years, a total  of 28  new schools have been completed - 21 primary \r\n\r\nand seven    secondary - with    610    classrooms    and accommodation  for\r\n\r\nmore  than  50,000  pupils.  In addition, there is a total of another 20 \r\n\r\nschools at various  stages of construction - nine primary  and 11  secondary.\r\n\r\nThey should be completed in time for next year's admissions, providing an \r\n\r\nadditional 425 classrooms or accommodation for more than 35,000 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npupils. In other words, by the end of this year, we would have completed\r\n\r\nthe building of 48 new schools with 1,035 classrooms and accommodation for \r\n\r\nno less than  85,000 pupils. It will be noted that  schools are  built \r\n\r\nthroughout the island from  rural  type single-storey   schools  to  \r\n\r\n10-storey   skyscraper schools  in  congested city areas with the  aim \r\n\r\nof serving the needs of our people.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.04 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  Sir, when merger and  Malaysia  come\r\n\r\ninto  being  by August 1963, defence  and  internal\r\n\r\nsecurity will be the responsibility of the  Central\r\n\r\nGovernment and the Singapore Police Force  and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Military Forces will be  transferred  to\r\n\r\nthe   Central  Government.

Other   factors   may   be\r\n\r\nattributed to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A greater degree of co-operation from the\r\n\r\npeople  and  confidence in  the  integrity  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the police which resulted in  better\r\n\r\ninformation    and   more   accurate   intelligence\r\n\r\nconcerning criminal gangsters;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A more intelligent and effective application\r\n\r\nof   the   Criminal   Law  (Temporary   Provisions)\r\n\r\nOrdinance; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) More effective preventive action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, so far as the secret society gangsters\r\n\r\nare  concerned, there has been a marked decline  in\r\n\r\nserious   crimes,  namely  murders,  gang   fights,\r\n\r\nriotings,  assaults, extortions and so  forth.  For\r\n\r\ninstance, in 1962, there were 10 murders as against\r\n\r\n18,  10 and 17 in 1961, 1960 and 1959 respectively.\r\n\r\nWhilst  there  was only one case of kidnapping  for\r\n\r\nransom  in  1962, there were 4, 13 and 4 cases  for\r\n\r\n1961,  1960 and 1959 respectively. The figures  for\r\n\r\nextortions  have also been improving very  steadily\r\n\r\nover  the past two years, as evidenced by the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  there were 415 such cases in 1962 as compared\r\n\r\nwith  467  in  1961  and 730  in  1960,  while  the\r\n\r\nincidence of rioting and assaults by secret society\r\n\r\nmembers has also shown a definite decrease in  that\r\n\r\nthere  were  207 such cases in 1962 as against  211\r\n\r\nfor  1961,  239  for 1960, and 402 for  1959.  With\r\n\r\nregard to crime in general, comparative figures  in\r\n\r\nrespect  of  seizable offences for the  last  three\r\n\r\nyears are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,500 cases in 1959\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,700 cases in 1960\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17,200 cases in 1961\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,700 cases in 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten vigilante corps consisting of members of the\r\n\r\npublic living in the rural areas who are anxious to\r\n\r\nassist  in  the maintenance of law and  order  have\r\n\r\nalready  been formed. The Police Cadet Corps  which\r\n\r\nwas established in schools in 1961 has increased in\r\n\r\nstrength  from  100  to 560, and  will  be  further\r\n\r\nincreased in accordance with planned development to\r\n\r\n620 members for 1963.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is today a significant and heartening\r\n\r\ndevelopment  in the relations of the  Police  Force\r\n\r\nwith  the  people  whom  they  serve,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  a new spirit of service  tempered\r\n\r\nwith  friendliness and approachability, which I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to say has eliminated to a large extent  the\r\n\r\nprevious  feelings  of  distrust  and  fear   which\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public used to have  towards  the\r\n\r\npolice.  Repeated requests have been  made  by  the\r\n\r\nresidents  in Queenstown, including the Member  for\r\n\r\nQueenstown,  over  the last two  years  for  a  new\r\n\r\npolice  station  to  be built somewhere  nearer  to\r\n\r\nQueenstown, a satellite town which will eventually\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncover an area of 600 acres With 17,500 flats\r\n\r\nand  schools,  markets, clinics  and  shops  and  a\r\n\r\npopulation  of 150,000. The nearest police  station\r\n\r\nat  present  is  the Tanjong Pagar  Police  Station\r\n\r\nwhich  is  too  far  away and inconvenient  to  the\r\n\r\npeople.  In  view  of  the  rapid  development   of\r\n\r\nQueenstown   and  the  dense  con   centration   of\r\n\r\npopulation, it was found desirable to site the  new\r\n\r\nstation  here  in order to serve the needs  of  the\r\n\r\ncommunity in the area. The proposal was included in\r\n\r\nthe  Four-Year Development Plan in 1961, and  I  am\r\n\r\nhappy  to  report  that construction  of  this  new\r\n\r\n$400,000  divisional police station  has  commenced\r\n\r\nearly  last  month and is due to  be  completed  in\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year.  The construction  of  the  new\r\n\r\npolice station here will serve to further the  good\r\n\r\nrelation between the police and the people in  that\r\n\r\nthe police personnel who will be working in the new\r\n\r\nstation  will themselves be living in  the  Housing\r\n\r\nand Development flats among the people. Their wives\r\n\r\nand  children will be going to the same markets and\r\n\r\nattending  the  same  schools  as  the  wives   and\r\n\r\nchildren  of  the people living in the  area.  This\r\n\r\nclose  social  contact  will  build  up  a  two-way\r\n\r\ntraffic  of  understanding and  co-operation.  This\r\n\r\nliving  together  of  police  personnel  among  the\r\n\r\npeople  is  a new trend which it is hoped  will  be\r\n\r\ndeveloped  in  other housing estates that  will  be\r\n\r\nbuilt in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raising of the 2nd Battalion of the Singapore\r\n\r\nInfantry Regiment is proceeding apace, and will  be\r\n\r\nup  to full strength by June this year.

Government, and to that end,\r\n\r\nhas    established   a   newly   organised   prison\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  service which would  include  staff\r\n\r\nwith   diplomas   in   social  studies   from   the\r\n\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pulau Senang Settlement Scheme for the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of secret society gangsters,  in  an\r\n\r\natmosphere  of  community living, without  security\r\n\r\nwalls  and  fence, has continued  to  flourish  and\r\n\r\nexpand,  and has received wide acclaim in its  role\r\n\r\nas  the  Government's primary experiment  in  penal\r\n\r\nresearch.  So  far,  375 persons have  successfully\r\n\r\nbeen  rehabilitated at Pulau Senang  and  released.\r\n\r\nThe  follow-up  scheme of a Work  Brigade  Camp  at\r\n\r\nJalan  Damai  for  detainees  released  from  Pulau\r\n\r\nSenang,  as the last lap in their progress  towards\r\n\r\nrehabilitation, has also been very successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the modern dormitory system at Ulu Bedok Reformatory Training Centre for young offenders has, since its introduction in 1961, been acclaimed by penal experts visiting the State as one of the most progressive of its kind in this part of the world. It is in this same humane spirit\r\n\r\nand  progressive outlook towards criminals that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  now  taken  another  bold   stride\r\n\r\nforward to demolish the outmoded Outram Road Prison\r\n\r\nand  to  construct  new  prison  accommodation   in\r\n\r\nChangi. As you know, Sir, the Outram Road Prison is\r\n\r\nover a hundred years old and undoubtedly falls  far\r\n\r\nshort  of the standards expected of modern prisons.\r\n\r\nBecause   of  its  age,  it  is  not  amenable   to\r\n\r\nrenovations.  Demolition of some  of  the  existing\r\n\r\nprison  premises within the Outram Road Prison  has\r\n\r\nalready  started,  while the  Reformative  Training\r\n\r\nCentre  at Pearl's Bank has already been evacuated,\r\n\r\nawaiting demolition at any time. In its place,  new\r\n\r\nup-to-date accommodation will be provided at Changi\r\n\r\nPrison  and  the Medium Security Prison  at  Changi\r\n\r\nCamp  based on the modern dormitory pattern at  Ulu\r\n\r\nBedok.  Extensive structural alterations in  Changi\r\n\r\nhave  already been put in hand, while new buildings\r\n\r\nwhich will provide the necessary extension and  up-to-date  improvement  in  prison  accommodation  in\r\n\r\nChangi  to  replace the outmoded Outram Prison  are\r\n\r\nbeing  carried  out.  When the  new  buildings  are\r\n\r\ncompleted  early  in 1964, the  prison  inmates  at\r\n\r\nOutram   Road   Prison,  including  the   political\r\n\r\ndetainees, will be able to live in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  congenial surroundings, with more  fresh  air\r\n\r\nand sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to improving the prison accommodation,\r\n\r\nthe  prison industries - an essential feature in the\r\n\r\nrehabilitation   process  of   prisoners - are   also\r\n\r\nexpanding. Construction of the new $800,000  prison\r\n\r\nlaundry,  capable  of catering for  all  Government\r\n\r\nrequirements, will be completed next month,  and  a\r\n\r\nfurther  100  prisoners at a  time  will  have  the\r\n\r\nchance to learn a new trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, social welfare problems have been\r\n\r\ndealt  with on a patch-work basis. The approach  of\r\n\r\nthe  present Government is different. We  recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the  basic  problems are unemployment,  over-crowding  and shortage of proper housing,  lack  of\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  healthy recreation,  and  lack  of\r\n\r\neducational opportunities. To tackle these problems\r\n\r\nat  their root, a positive and imaginative approach\r\n\r\nis  necessary. Hence, we have chosen to concentrate\r\n\r\nour  major  exertions on industrialisation,  merger\r\n\r\nand     Malaysia    (which    will     speed     up\r\n\r\nindustrialisation),  on the  rapid  development  of\r\n\r\nhousing,  on the development of community  centres,\r\n\r\nparks and youth camps, improving and increasing the\r\n\r\neducational facilities available to the people. The\r\n\r\nmore people get jobs, have proper houses to stay in\r\n\r\nand places of healthy recreation to go to, and have\r\n\r\nschools for their children to attend, the less will\r\n\r\nbe  the cases needing social welfare help. Positive\r\n\r\nsocial  uplift is always much better than defensive\r\n\r\nsocial  welfare help. Nevertheless, for those  that\r\n\r\nstill  need social welfare assistance. The  present\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  both  improved  and  extended  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  facilities obtainable by the  people.  For\r\n\r\nexample, a new creche has been opened last year  in\r\n\r\nMountbatten area and today working mothers in  that\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  are  able  to  leave   their   young\r\n\r\nchildren in this creche in the morning before  they\r\n\r\ngo  to work and collect them back in the evening on\r\n\r\ntheir  way  home.  Besides this creche,  two  other\r\n\r\ncreches are in the process of construction - one  in\r\n\r\nthe  Bukit  Ho  Swee area, and  the  other  in  the\r\n\r\nRochore area - both densely populated areas. A  third\r\n\r\ncreche is being built on the ground\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfloor of the Housing and Development Board block of\r\n\r\nfiats  in  Cantonment  Road,  Tanjong  Pagar.  When\r\n\r\nready, these three creches will together cater  for\r\n\r\nnearly 500 babies and young children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the other end of our social welfare service,\r\n\r\nfrom the cradle to the grave, we are not neglecting\r\n\r\nthe welfare of the aged. Work has already begun  on\r\n\r\na  large rural settlement for old people at  a  30-acre  site  in Woodlands. When the first phase  has\r\n\r\nbeen completed early next year. The settlement will\r\n\r\nhouse  300  homeless destitutes  and  old  men  and\r\n\r\nwomen.  Apart  from accommodation,  there  will  be\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  vegetable  and  flower  gardening,\r\n\r\nanimal  husbandry,  sheltered workshop  employment,\r\n\r\nrecreation and medical attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also continued to provide\r\n\r\nassistance  to  victims  of civil  calamities.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in the recent Bukit Ban Kee fire,  which\r\n\r\ntook  a  toll of approximately 2,000 fire  victims,\r\n\r\nthe Government stepped in immediately to look after\r\n\r\nthe  welfare  of  those made homeless.  Within  the\r\n\r\nshort  space  of five days, the fire  victims  were\r\n\r\nhoused  in the Housing and Development Board  flats\r\n\r\nat  low rentals and close to their former place  of\r\n\r\nresidence. This is concrete evidence of the success\r\n\r\nof  rapid and extensive social development achieved\r\n\r\nby  the Government and reflects also the efficiency\r\n\r\nof the Social Welfare Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]   </b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>11.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rent subsidies scheme, in most cases at a\r\n\r\nceiling  rate of $35 per month, are being  paid  by\r\n\r\nthe Government for three months. Besides Government\r\n\r\nrelief, a Bukit Ban Kee Fire Relief Fund was set up\r\n\r\nto  appeal for donations for the rehabilitation  of\r\n\r\nthe  fire victims, and lo date. The total collected\r\n\r\nexceeds  $70,000,  the greater part  of  which  has\r\n\r\nalready been distributed in relief payments to  the\r\n\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the present Government came to power in June\r\n\r\n1959,  it  announced that statutory provisions  for\r\n\r\nthe  protection  of  workers, such  as  payment  of\r\n\r\nworkers, such as payment of overtime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwages,  holiday pay, rest day pay,  etc, had  been\r\n\r\nevaded  and  that strong action would be  taken  to\r\n\r\nenforce those provisions. I am glad to say that, as\r\n\r\na  result  of  action taken in  pursuance  of  this\r\n\r\npolicy, widespread evasion of statutory obligations\r\n\r\nis now a thing of the past, and if it exists, it is\r\n\r\nalmost negligible. The Labour Department up to date\r\n\r\nhas  recovered,  through  its  Labour  Inspectorate\r\n\r\nalone,  a sum of almost half a million dollars  and\r\n\r\npaid  it  over  to the workers concerned.  In  most\r\n\r\ncases,  the  employers  paid  willingly  after  the\r\n\r\nofficials of the department had explained the  law.\r\n\r\nFurther,  when employers refused to, or would  not,\r\n\r\nmeet their legal obligations to their workmen,  the\r\n\r\nworkmen, encouraged by the pro-labour policy of the\r\n\r\nGovernment,  and  in  many cases  helped  by  their\r\n\r\nunions, took their claims to the two Labour  Courts\r\n\r\nwhose services are provided free of charge. One  of\r\n\r\nthese   Courts  was  expressly  set  up   by   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  meet  the sudden  increase  in  the\r\n\r\nnumber  of complaints, so that all claims could  be\r\n\r\ndealt  with expeditiously with as little delay  and\r\n\r\ninconvenience  to  the workers as  possible.  As  a\r\n\r\nresult,  from  June  1959 up to  date,  the  Labour\r\n\r\nCourts  recovered  a total sum  of  almost  half  a\r\n\r\nmillion dollars and paid it to the workers who came\r\n\r\nunder  the  Labour Ordinance, the Clerks Employment\r\n\r\nOrdinance  and  the Shop Assistants  Ordinance.  It\r\n\r\nmust  also  be  mentioned  that,  during  the  same\r\n\r\nperiod,  through  the good offices  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nCourts, a  sum of about $50,000 was  recovered  on\r\n\r\nbehalf of domestic servants who did not fall  under\r\n\r\nthe above-mentioned Ordinances but who nevertheless\r\n\r\nsought the aid of the Labour Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the Government's declared\r\n\r\npolicy,  the building of a large centrally-situated\r\n\r\nTrade  Union House took shape during the year.  The\r\n\r\npiling work for the project, which will cost  $4.15\r\n\r\nmillion,  began in August last year after  a  brief\r\n\r\nceremony  at  which  a worker  selected  by  secret\r\n\r\nballot  drove  the  first  pile.  The  building  is\r\n\r\nexpected to be completed by November 1964. It  will\r\n\r\nbe  styled \"The Singapore Conference Hall and Trade\r\n\r\nUnion  House.\" It will have all the facilities  and\r\n\r\namenities which\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuch  an  institution  should  have,  such  as   an\r\n\r\nauditorium   for   international   conferences,   a\r\n\r\ntheatrete,  flexible conference roofs, a  reception\r\n\r\nhall  and  lounge,  offices  for  trade  unions,  a\r\n\r\nresearch  section and library, canteen  facilities,\r\n\r\netc.  The  building,  when completed,  will  be  an\r\n\r\nimpressive  symbol  of the solidarity  of  all  the\r\n\r\ngenuine trade unions in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the split in the trade union movement in\r\n\r\n1961,  anti-national elements stirred up industrial\r\n\r\nunrest  with  a view to sabotaging the Government's\r\n\r\nindustrialisation  programme   and   wrecking   the\r\n\r\neconomy  of  the State. There were 112 strikes  and\r\n\r\nfour  lock-outs  during the year - the  highest  ever\r\n\r\nrecorded since 1956. The significant point to  note\r\n\r\nabout  these stoppages is that 75 per cent of  them\r\n\r\noccurred  during the second half of the year,  that\r\n\r\nis  after  the  split in the trade union  movement.\r\n\r\nFrom   July  onwards,  industrial  stoppages   rose\r\n\r\nsharply and, for the last three months of the year.\r\n\r\nThere  was  an  average of 19  strikes  per  month.\r\n\r\nFurther,  a  motion on this industrial  unrest  was\r\n\r\nintroduced  in  the  Assembly  by  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nCairnhill  and debated by the House.  However,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment that caters for the task of raising  the\r\n\r\nstandard of living of the workers and ensuring that\r\n\r\nthe  people receive a fair share of the  fruits  of\r\n\r\nindustry,   went  about  its  duty  of  maintaining\r\n\r\nindustrial peace with vigour and foresight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of experience of working the\r\n\r\nIndustrial Relations Ordinance, the Government  has\r\n\r\nmade  a  number of amendments to it,  in  order  to\r\n\r\nachieve   greater  clarity  and  remove   anomalies\r\n\r\narising  out  of its application. It  is  provided,\r\n\r\ninter  alia,  that all negotiations  on  industrial\r\n\r\nmatters  shall be in accordance with the provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  Ordinance and penalties are  provided  for\r\n\r\ncontravention thereof. This amendment was necessary\r\n\r\nbecause  certain  unions were holding  negotiations\r\n\r\noutside  the provisions of the Ordinance  and  thus\r\n\r\ndefeating the intention behind the Ordinance. It is\r\n\r\nimperative,  in the interests of industrial  peace,\r\n\r\nthat  the  machinery provided for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nsettling   trade   disputes  should   be   followed\r\n\r\nstrictly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that the labour situation during\r\n\r\nthe  past year has improved considerably. There was\r\n\r\nan appreciable decrease in the number of industrial\r\n\r\nstoppages   and  man-days  lost.  There   were   88\r\n\r\nindustrial  stoppages  with 165,000  man-days  lost\r\n\r\nlast year as against 116 stoppages with 411,000 man-days  lost  in  1961. During the last three  months\r\n\r\nthere  has been a total of only 9 stoppages.  There\r\n\r\nwas  also an appreciable decrease in the number for\r\n\r\ntrade  disputes  referred to  the  Department  last\r\n\r\nyear.  There were, 1,064 trade disputes in 1962  as\r\n\r\nagainst 1,225 in 1961.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to obviate any delay in the quick and\r\n\r\nspeedy  settlement of trade disputes  submitted  to\r\n\r\narbitration and the certification of agreements,  a\r\n\r\nsecond industrial Arbitration Court was set  up  in\r\n\r\nOctober  last year. As a result of this  today  the\r\n\r\nbacklog  of  cases  has been considerably  reduced.\r\n\r\nLast  year  the two Courts arbitrated 31 cases  and\r\n\r\ncertified 264 agreements, compared with nine  cases\r\n\r\nand  121 agreements for the 1960-61 period. At  the\r\n\r\nend of last month there were only 30 cases awaiting\r\n\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concrete manifestation of the Government's pro-labour policy has been the creation of the Labour\r\n\r\nResearch Unit. Trade unionists have complained that\r\n\r\nwhile  employers have excellent research facilities\r\n\r\nand  qualified personnel at their disposal to  help\r\n\r\nthem  with the presentation of their cases  in  the\r\n\r\nArbitration  Court, trade unions  have  been  at  a\r\n\r\ndisadvantage.  Trade unionists with  the  necessary\r\n\r\nexperience and qualifications to help trade  unions\r\n\r\nare  few  in  number, and trade unions  possess  no\r\n\r\nadequate research facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government considered the representation of\r\n\r\ntrade unions made through the National Trades Union\r\n\r\nCongress,  and decided to set up a Labour  Research\r\n\r\nUnit  staffed by qualified economists,  accountants\r\n\r\nand  legal men. Nine trade union leaders have  been\r\n\r\nseconded  from their places of employment to  serve\r\n\r\nas  industrial  officers with the  Labour  Research\r\n\r\nUnit.  The  functions of these industrial  officers\r\n\r\nare to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  trade  unions with the formulation  of  their\r\n\r\nclaims in negotiations with employers and with  the\r\n\r\npresentation  of union cases before the  Industrial\r\n\r\nArbitration   Court.   The  Government   has   also\r\n\r\nrequested the I.L.O. for the services of a research\r\n\r\nspecialist  to set up the research section  of  the\r\n\r\nUnit. Trade unions have majority representation  on\r\n\r\nthe  Governing Board of this Unit. I may also state\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government regards the  Labour  Research\r\n\r\nUnit  as  an independent body, not subject  to  any\r\n\r\nofficial  control,  and which exists  primarily  to\r\n\r\nserve  the  trade  unions. In short,  although  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  pays the piper, it is the trade  unions\r\n\r\nwho call the tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The services of the Labour Research Unit are open\r\n\r\nto  all  trade  unions, whatever their affiliations\r\n\r\nmay  be.  So  far, however, the S.A.T.U. group  of\r\n\r\nunions  have  not cared to call on the services  of\r\n\r\nthis  Unit. I need not labour the reasons for this.\r\n\r\nThe  pro-Communist  leaders of the  S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\ncannot  be  expected to conduct  research  for  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  of  the  workers, and the Labour  Research\r\n\r\nUnit,  from their point of view, is bad because  it\r\n\r\nonly  does research to justify the claims of labour\r\n\r\nand  maintains  no connection with  the  Indonesian\r\n\r\nCommunist Party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most encouraging result of the Government's\r\n\r\npro-labour  policy has been the continuous  defeats\r\n\r\ninflicted  by the workers themselves  on  the  pro-Communist  leadership of the trade union  movement.\r\n\r\nIt   is  open  knowledge  that  before  the  P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment took office, pro-Communists in the trade\r\n\r\nunions  had  contrived  to secure  almost  complete\r\n\r\ncontrol over the non-Communist workers of Singapore\r\n\r\nand  to use them not for the benefit of the workers\r\n\r\nbut for the benefit of the Communist cause. Because\r\n\r\nof   the   undeniable  pro-labour  policy  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, the Communists have failed this time to\r\n\r\nbring  the  majority of workers in Singapore  under\r\n\r\ntheir  hegemony.  For the first time  in  the  last\r\n\r\ndecade  there  exists  in  Singapore  a  vital  and\r\n\r\nexpanding  democratic alternative to the Communist-controlled  trade union movement. I  do  not  think\r\n\r\nthat the pro-Communists at the moment would dare to\r\n\r\ndeny that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  are rapidly losing their hold on the  workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore.  It  is common knowledge  that  ever\r\n\r\nsince  the split in the trade union movement  there\r\n\r\nhas  been a one-way traffic of workers of the  pro-Communist S.A.T.U. group to the non-Communist camp.\r\n\r\nUp  to  the end of January this year, at  least  37\r\n\r\nbranches  involving  more than 3,000  workers  have\r\n\r\nshifted  over from the S.A.T.U. group of unions  to\r\n\r\nthe  democratic  side.

On the other hand,\r\n\r\na decline in the fortunes of the S.A.T.U. group can\r\n\r\nbe seen, apart from these 37, from the fact that at\r\n\r\nthe  time  of  its  formation, the  S.A.T.U. group\r\n\r\nclaimed to have the support of 80 odd trade unions,\r\n\r\nbut  it could manage to get only 14 unions to issue\r\n\r\na  joint  statement  on the  eve  of  the  national\r\n\r\nreferendum calling for blank votes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the Barisan members why the eyes of\r\n\r\nthe  workers of Singapore have been opened and  why\r\n\r\nit  is  that there is a general movement of workers\r\n\r\naway  from  them.  In the first place,  it  is  not\r\n\r\npossible  for  the pro-Communists to fool  all  the\r\n\r\nworkers  all the time. No amount of anti-Government\r\n\r\npropaganda will be able to convince the majority of\r\n\r\nthe  workers  of Singapore that this Government  is\r\n\r\nanti-labour. Our labour record is there for all  to\r\n\r\nsee   and   it  is  general  knowledge  that   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  been responsible  for  introducing\r\n\r\ninto   Singapore   the   most  progressive   labour\r\n\r\nlegislation anywhere in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the workers of Singapore are able to see\r\n\r\nthat  the  S.A.T.U. group of trade unions  has,  in\r\n\r\nfact,   exploited  them  for  pro-Communist   anti-national  purposes. Whenever the S.A.T.U. group  of\r\n\r\ntrade  unions indulged in industrial action,  their\r\n\r\npurpose was not to obtain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  the  workers, but to  convert  every\r\n\r\nindustrial action into a political campaign against\r\n\r\nthe  Government.  As  a  result  of  the  Communist\r\n\r\nhandling of trade disputes, innocent workers  found\r\n\r\nthemselves embroiled not only with the employer but\r\n\r\nalso with the law and the police. It is needless to\r\n\r\nsay that this was precisely the strategy of the pro-communist  S.A.T.U. leaders  to  ensure  that  the\r\n\r\nworkers  did find themselves so embroiled.  On  the\r\n\r\nother  hand,  the  non-Communist  trade  unions  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  have  also initiated industrial  action,\r\n\r\nbut  they  have  always taken care to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nindustrial disputes remained industrial  in  nature\r\n\r\nand   were   not  converted  into  instruments   of\r\n\r\npolitical action. The democratic trade unions  have\r\n\r\nalso  had  greater  recourse  to  the  conciliation\r\n\r\nmachinery  provided by the Labour Ministry  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  processes  of arbitration. One  of  the  major\r\n\r\nreasons  why  workers  in  increasing  numbers  are\r\n\r\nleaving  the  Communist  fold  is  that  they  have\r\n\r\ndiscovered  for  themselves that the  non-Communist\r\n\r\nlabour  movement, simply because of its intelligent\r\n\r\nand  responsible  attitude to trade  disputes,  has\r\n\r\nbeen  able to secure much better benefits  for  the\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the S.A.T.U. group are failing and will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to fail for the good reason that  workers\r\n\r\nare  beginning to realise that the S.A.T.U. leaders\r\n\r\nare not genuine trade unionists but political prize\r\n\r\nfighters  in  the  cause of foreign  anti-Malaysian\r\n\r\nforces.  The  S.A.T.U. group will  inevitably  fail\r\n\r\nbecause the workers of Singapore cannot be expected\r\n\r\nto  trust those who show a greater affinity to  the\r\n\r\nCommunists  of  Indonesia than to  the  progressive\r\n\r\nforces  of Malaysian nationalism. It will not  have\r\n\r\nescaped the attention of Members of this House  and\r\n\r\nof  the  workers of Singapore that  the  S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\ngroup of trade unionists have not cared, so far, to\r\n\r\npublicly  deny their sympathies with the  Communist\r\n\r\nParty  of  Indonesia. I can assure the  workers  of\r\n\r\nSingapore  that they will not get any  such  denial\r\n\r\nfrom  S.A.T.U. for the good reason that the charges\r\n\r\nare true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the stock accusations of the pro-Communist\r\n\r\nS.A.T.U. group  of  trade  unions  is  that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment has failed to support the unification of\r\n\r\nthe  trade  union movement. When the pro-Communists\r\n\r\ntalked   about  unification  of  the  trade   union\r\n\r\nmovement, they mean the control of the movement  by\r\n\r\nthe front agents of the Malayan Communist Party. It\r\n\r\nis  surely  impossible to expect the Government  to\r\n\r\nhelp  the  Communists to gain control of the  trade\r\n\r\nunion movement on the pretext of unification and to\r\n\r\nsurrender the non-Communist majority of the workers\r\n\r\nof  Singapore  to  the tender  mercies  of  foreign\r\n\r\ninspired    anti-national    elements.    In    the\r\n\r\ncircumstances, it is better that there should be  a\r\n\r\nclear  demarcation between pro-Communists and  non-Communists in the trade union movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will continue to encourage the\r\n\r\ngenuine unification of the trade union movement but\r\n\r\non  the  basis of democratic and independent  trade\r\n\r\nunionism. We have no doubt that in the final result\r\n\r\nthe  labour  movement  of  Singapore  will  be   so\r\n\r\nunified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat here the Government's\r\n\r\nassurance  that it has not discriminated  and  will\r\n\r\nnot  discriminate, against those  innocent  workers\r\n\r\nwho  still find themselves within the pro-Communist\r\n\r\norbit so long as they observe the provisions of the\r\n\r\nlaw  and  press their claims within the context  of\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Relations Ordinance. The Government\r\n\r\nalso  repeats its warning to employers not to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  the recent arrests of  pro-Communist\r\n\r\ntrade  union leaders in order to victimise  workers\r\n\r\nwho  have  the misfortune to belong to the S.A.T.U.\r\n\r\ngroup of trade unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government intends to ensure industrial\r\n\r\njustice to all workers irrespective of their  trade\r\n\r\nunion  affiliations. However, we have no  intention\r\n\r\nof  allowing pro-Communist trade union  leaders  to\r\n\r\nmislead the workers into breaking the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  law  and will come down with a heavy  hand  on\r\n\r\nthose leaders if they decide to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nin debating the motion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmoved  by the Prime Minister to express our  thanks\r\n\r\nto  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for the speech which\r\n\r\nhe  delivered  on behalf of the Government  at  the\r\n\r\nopening  of  this Session, I rise  to  speak  after\r\n\r\nhaving followed the speech made by His Excellency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not a single matter in the speech which\r\n\r\ncould   impress   us   in   connection   with   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policies in the  future,  except  for\r\n\r\nmatters which can be considered routine - old  matter\r\n\r\nrepeated; for instance, the construction of houses,\r\n\r\ninstallation of standpipes, street lights,  etc.  I\r\n\r\nthink,  as  I  have said earlier,  that  these  are\r\n\r\nnormal  matters which can be heard over the  radio,\r\n\r\nand quite recently through television, and also can\r\n\r\nbe  read  from pamphlets issued by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nCulture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing this policy speech, I should like to\r\n\r\nstress, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what impresses  me\r\n\r\nis  that we discover that at the end of the  speech\r\n\r\nthere is an appeal to the leaders, particularly to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMembers   of   this   Assembly,   to   share    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility with the Government to  nurture  the\r\n\r\nhealthy democratic system in our State.
