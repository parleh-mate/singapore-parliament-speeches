Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, the transboundary haze creates health problems for our citizens and has wide-spread implications on our economy, tourism and the transportation/aviation industry.&nbsp; The elderly, especially those with asthma or a pre-existing heart or lung disease, may suffer from chest discomfort or breathing problems such as shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing.&nbsp; Prolonged periods of haze also <p align=left>Column: 1452<p>lead to economic losses for Singapore. The losses are from a rise in hospitalisation and treatment costs, losses in tourism, losses in productivity because people take time off from work and losses in recreational opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the period of haze was short this year, any impact on our industries, including tourism, would have been minimal.&nbsp; However, if the haze were prolonged, there would have been adverse impact on economic activities and health, as was seen in the 2006 haze episode.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we thus take a serious view of the haze situation.&nbsp; To minimise the adverse impacts of smoke haze on Singaporeans, an Inter-agency Haze Task Force (HTF) has been established since 1994 to co-ordinate the national action plans to mitigate the impact of haze and put in place measures to inform the public during a smoke haze episode.&nbsp; For example, hourly updates of the three-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) and the relevant health advisory are given when the haze worsens.&nbsp; When the PSI reaches the unhealthy range, which is above&nbsp;100, a dedicated hotline will be set up to answer any queries from the public. When the PSI exceeds 150, the public will be advised to use face masks. When the reading reaches the hazardous range, which is above 200, the HTF will consider stoppage of outdoor activities and closure of schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the 2006 haze episode, Singapore has actively promoted regional and international efforts to address the haze problem.&nbsp; That year, Singapore initiated the Sub-regional Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand to enhance haze collaboration in the southern ASEAN region. &nbsp;The MSC has met&nbsp;10 times since then.&nbsp; One of its objectives is to assist Indonesia in implementing its Plan of Action (PoA) to <p align=left>Column: 1453<p>combat haze.&nbsp; The MSC closely monitors the hotspot situation in the region.&nbsp; The MSC has organised forums that raise awareness among international organisations, non-governmental organisations and the private sector on the need to share expertise and offer resources in addressing land and forest fires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bilateral front, our collaboration in Jambi province has progressed well.&nbsp; Eight action programmes, covering initiatives ranging from haze monitoring and assessment to fire fighting and suppression capabilities as well as capacity building on sustainable land-farming practices, have been completed since 2007.&nbsp; Thus far, we note that the number of hotspots have been low in Jambi Province and, in particular, Muaro-Jambi Regency, relative to other fire-prone provinces and districts in Indonesia.&nbsp; Singapore&rsquo;s initiatives are being implemented in these areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are thus heartened that our efforts over the last few years have contributed towards addressing the haze challenges in Indonesia.&nbsp; We believe it is important to replicate the good experiences gained from the Indonesia-Singapore collaboration in the Jambi province.&nbsp; This could be achieved by continuing to organise forums that can help facilitate exchange of experience and best practices between local governments from the fire-prone provinces as well as with regional NGOs, international organisations and think tanks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 13th October this year, I attended the 6th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, which was held to review the national, sub-regional and regional activities to address land and forest fires in the region.&nbsp; We cautioned environment ministers present that periods of dry conditions may occur, and <p align=left>Column: 1454<p>urged ASEAN member states to remain vigilant and to continuously monitor as well as implement haze prevention activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together with the other environment ministers, Singapore also urged Indonesia to ratify the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution.&nbsp; With Indonesia remaining the only ASEAN country yet to ratify this Agreement, we will continue with our ASEAN neighbours to call on Indonesia to consider doing so expeditiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Malaysia and Singapore were struck by haze on 19th October, I wrote immediately and followed up with a call to Indonesia&rsquo;s State Minister of Environment Professor Gusti Muhammad Hatta to register our concerns on the worsening haze situation.&nbsp; I was assured that Indonesia had sent a team of officers to the areas affected by land and forest fires to coordinate the fire-fighting efforts on the ground.&nbsp; I also reiterated our offer of assistance to augment Indonesia&rsquo;s fire-fighting efforts if needed.&nbsp; On 24th October, the air quality was back in the good range again as the fires subsided in Sumatra.&nbsp; Indonesia has therefore made commendable efforts to prevent the regional haze situation from worsening this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is currently chair of the MSC for two years until 2012. We will use our chairmanship to work more closely with our regional neighbours to put in place more measures to prevent potential land and forest fires.&nbsp; This will avert the need for huge resources required by affected countries to tackle the problems after transboundary haze occurs.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.&nbsp; We are lucky that for this round, haze visited Singapore for a very short period.&nbsp; I have two supplementary questions for the Minister.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1455<p>In view of the constant remark by Indonesian politicians that we should be grateful for the oxygen provided rather than complain about the haze problems, does the Minister think that Indonesia has the political will to solve the haze problem?&nbsp; Question two:&nbsp;&nbsp;despite the various reminders, telephone calls, cautionary notes that Minister gives to his counterpart, does he think that these have been&nbsp;effective?&nbsp; As what we can see &ndash; and if I may describe their attitude by using a Malay proverb&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;<I>bagai mencurah air di daun keladi</I>.&nbsp; Literally translated, it means \"pouring water on&nbsp;yam leaves\" which is to say it is of no use.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> &nbsp; Sir, as to whether or not they have the political will to solve the problem is not something for me to answer.&nbsp; We know for a fact that the Indonesian government has a clear plan of action to cut back the&nbsp;forest fires in&nbsp;35 fire-prone provinces across Indonesia over the next five years.&nbsp; As I have&nbsp;mentioned in my reply, what we want to do in the ASEAN region is to work with Indonesia to help them to implement those programmes.&nbsp; In fact, they have called for assistance across the ASEAN countries in order to implement the plan of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it is being executed&nbsp;on the ground, this is a matter which we have to ask our Indonesian colleagues to clarify.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our relationship with the Indonesian government in relation to our joint project in Jambi has been a good one.&nbsp; We have close collaboration not only with the central authorities but also with the provincial authorities.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my reply, that has helped to reduced the hot spots in the Muaro-Jambi Regency.&nbsp; So it shows that they have a plan of action and there is collaboration with the regional countries. It shows that it can be done and we can solve the problem together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to whether the reminders have been effective, I suppose&nbsp;the answer is <p align=left>Column: 1456<p>that we will continue to remind them that they have an obligation to the rest of the countries in the region to do their part.&nbsp; So I cannot tell the Member&nbsp;anything else, other than the fact that I will continue to remind my colleagues in the region when we meet again in Singapore&nbsp;next year for the 11th&nbsp;MSC Meeting to inform that this is a concern for all of us and that they should do something about it.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)</B>:&nbsp; Thank you, Sir.&nbsp; I have three supplementary questions.&nbsp; One is: has Singapore considered cloud-seeding as a solution to the haze problem and, if it has, would it offer the same expertise to Indonesia?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, during the haze Singaporeans tended to stay indoors,&nbsp;shut their windows and for better ventilation, Singaporeans would switch on fans and air-conditioners.&nbsp; I wonder whether a study has been undertaken to ascertain whether there is a spike in electricity bills during the haze situation?&nbsp; Will the Government consider giving electricity rebates to cope with&nbsp;higher electricity bills when the haze prevails in Singapore?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, what legal rights do average Singaporeans have against transboundary pollution like the&nbsp;haze situation?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The advantage of the MSC Forum is that it is open to the international organisations, the NGOs and the think tanks.&nbsp; This will allow international organisations&nbsp;that have an interest to come into the region and work together with the regional partners.&nbsp; So, I think that is a very good platform for us to share best practices, clarify the matter to the international community so that help can be made available in tackling this problem.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HAZE AND FOREST FIRES--><p align=left>Column: 1457<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:HAZE AND FOREST FIRES:::1463--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr George Yong-Boon Yeo)</B>:&nbsp; As we heard from Minister&nbsp;Yaacob, last month, Singapore was again seriously affected by smoke haze from forest and peatland fires in Sumatra.&nbsp; There was a day when the Pollutant Standards Index hit the \"unhealthy\" range.&nbsp; The haze affected not only people in Singapore and Malaysia.&nbsp; It affected most of&nbsp;the people in Indonesia who lived closest to the fires.&nbsp; The haze is therefore a matter of very serious concern to us, to the Indonesians and to the entire region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 21st October, Minister Yaacob called his Indonesian counterpart, Pak Gusti, to convey Singapore&rsquo;s concerns over the haze and to offer our assistance to combat the forest fires.&nbsp; I spoke to Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa the following morning&nbsp;to reiterate our concerns and our immediate readiness to assist Indonesia.&nbsp; Pak Marty told me that he was also concerned about the situation and assured me that the Indonesian authorities were trying to address the problem.&nbsp; And he stressed the importance of regional cooperation and how it had helped in the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is over for this year, in part helped by the wet weather.&nbsp; When I was in Hanoi for the ASEAN&nbsp;Summit and other related meetings, I thanked Pak Marty for Indonesia's cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that the haze does not respect boundaries, it is imperative that regional countries continue to work closely together on this issue.&nbsp; Singapore and Malaysia have been collaborating with the provincial governments of Jambi and Riau respectively on various fire and haze prevention programmes.&nbsp; The Sub-Regional <p align=left>Column: 1459<p>Ministerial Steering Committee (MSC) on Transboundary Haze Pollution also meets regularly.&nbsp; These efforts have helped to mitigate the haze problem in the last three years.&nbsp; But our experience this year shows that more needs to be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problems faced by the region from the haze led to an ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution.&nbsp; The Indonesian government signed this Agreement in the year 2002 but, unfortunately, has yet to ratify it.&nbsp; It has to be ratified by the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR).&nbsp; Although the executive branch of the Indonesian government considers the Agreement important, some members of the DPR have objected to it on the grounds that Indonesia does not benefit sufficiently from this&nbsp;Agreement.&nbsp; It is hard to understand this argument.&nbsp; To begin with, Indonesians living in Sumatra and Kalimantan who are badly affected by the smoke haze will benefit&nbsp;most from the Agreement.&nbsp; We need Indonesia to take the lead on this issue when it takes over the ASEAN Chairmanship next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The haze is not only a local or regional issue.&nbsp; It has a global dimension as well.&nbsp; The reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important element of ongoing climate change negotiations under the Bali Action Plan called REDD Plus &ndash;

He was responsible for helping to combat the haze.&nbsp; He was telling me how, in one of those years when the haze was quite bad, they got the Russians to help and they leased water bombers from the Russians.&nbsp; And against the advice of the civil aviation authorities, he decided to take a joy ride to watch the water bombing.&nbsp; The facilities on the plane were quite basic.&nbsp; He was telling me that there were no seat belts, just a plastic chair, <p align=left>Column: 1461<p>and you were supposed to grab the pilot&rsquo;s seat while they skimmed the water surface, collected the water, and then bombed the fires.&nbsp; And this worked.&nbsp; When I spoke to Pak Marty on the phone, he said cooperation in the past had helped and we should continue to strengthen cooperation.&nbsp; He said yes, this year is a problem, but in previous years, we had succeeded; so we should continue to work together.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have the plans.&nbsp; It is a big country, there are many players involved.&nbsp; Local authorities experience great difficulties.&nbsp; And it is not as if they themselves want it to happen.&nbsp; The former Governor of Jambi, Pak Zulkifli Nurdin, is a good friend and knows Singapore very well.&nbsp; One year, I called him up and said, \"Look, we are prepared to help Jambi.\"&nbsp; I asked him where he was.&nbsp; He said he was in Jakarta and could not&nbsp;get back to Jambi because the haze was so bad there!&nbsp; And here we are talking about a PSI of 100, but for them, it is PSI of 200 or 300.&nbsp; So our approach should be that the most interested party in solving the haze problem is Indonesia itself, because millions of its own people are affected.&nbsp; And we should continue to encourage the DPR&nbsp;&ndash; the government is very clear about its position, but the DPR has got a life and voice of its own.&nbsp; And maybe here I can pass the buck to Members of this House.

Some of them are Singapore companies.&nbsp; So, we should take a multi-pronged approach.&nbsp; Internationally, where we can help Indonesia overcome this problem, we should act at that level.&nbsp; Regionally, in ASEAN, we should do the same, through the corporate sector, or at the government-to-government and parliament-to-parliament levels.

These investigations showed that he may also have committed fraud at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koh joined Infocomm Development Authority&nbsp;(IDA) in 1997. He was deployed by IDA to Supreme Court, IPOS and then SLA.&nbsp; He left SLA and resigned from IDA earlier this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koh's accomplice in the SLA case, Lim Chai Meng, joined IDA in 2006.&nbsp; SLA was his only posting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At SLA, Lim was the officer who initiated IT procurement and evaluated quotations.&nbsp; Koh was the officer authorised to approve quotations.&nbsp; Koh and Lim are suspected to have conspired with several business entities to win IT contracts from SLA, and then submit false invoices to receive payment for the services and goods being procured, but which the business entities never intended to deliver.&nbsp; The fraudulent activities were conducted between January 2008 and March 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At IPOS, Koh was the officer who initiated procurement and evaluated quotations.&nbsp; He is suspected to have conspired with one business entity to submit lowest quotations for IT maintenance services and goods being procured by IPOS.&nbsp; IPOS would then be billed for the services and goods which were never delivered.&nbsp; The activities took place between December 2005 and March 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The perpetrators took careful steps to get the appearance of compliance and <p align=left>Column: 1465<p>normality.&nbsp; They kept the procurement amounts within approval limits, complied with the internal guidelines such as getting the requisite approvals and putting up the requisite paperwork.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the charges for the suspected fraud at SLA and IPOS have been tendered in court.&nbsp; To date, the amount allegedly defrauded from SLA is about $12.18 million and the amount from IPOS is about $286,000.&nbsp; Of these, about $10 million have been secured pending the completion of the trial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA and IPOS' procurement and finance processes were in accordance with procurement guidelines.&nbsp; Koh and Lim are believed to be have circumvented the checks and balances by colluding with each other and with business entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General did not audit SLA and IPOS during the period when the frauds took place.&nbsp; SLA and IPOS' financial statements and accounts were instead audited by external auditors, in accordance with the Auditor-General's requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, immediately after the frauds were discovered, SLA and IPOS launched their own internal investigations.&nbsp; The Ministry also set up independent Internal Review Panels to identify how the frauds took place and to recommend measures to tighten SLA and IPOS' procurement and finance processes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Panels have given their views and recommendations.&nbsp; Among their conclusions was that certain officers at SLA and IPOS did not exercise sufficient supervision over Koh and Lim and had not carried out their audit responsibilities thoroughly, and that there were weaknesses in the internal audit processes at SLA and IPOS.&nbsp; SLA and IDA have since taken disciplinary action against two officers whose oversight had <p align=left>Column: 1466<p>contributed to the fraud taking place undetected in SLA.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the fraud at IPOS, IDA is currently conducting disciplinary investigations against Koh's supervisors during the period he was deployed at IPOS.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLA and IPOS have since been implementing the recommendations of the Panels and the outcome of their own internal investigations.&nbsp;&nbsp;These include strengthening internal audit, centralising the procurement processes under&nbsp;one department, requiring a different officer to verify the request to call for quotation and reducing the limit for approval of financial transactions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In taking these measures, we need, however, to strike a balance between adding more layers of checks and the resultant reduction in operational efficiency.&nbsp; We must guard against tightening up the system so much that the vast majority of legitimate transactions are hindered on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp; Adding more checks will slow down the work&nbsp; for many officers but may not necessarily increase our ability to detect fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this, I speak as someone who has been involved in investigating and taking follow-up actions in various such frauds in the private sector, including Barings. &nbsp;No system can guarantee to prevent fraud against a skilful&nbsp;operator. Even audits, whether external or internal, are not always guaranteed to pick up fraudulent activities.&nbsp; The real insurance against fraud is to have vigilant people supervising and discharging their responsibilities properly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the system of checks and balances is built on the basis that officers entrusted with the approval authority and supervisory responsibilities discharge these responsibilities diligently and with care.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>They have to&nbsp;ask questions and undertake regular reviews.&nbsp; When they do not do so, there is opportunity for fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1467<p>Sir, let me emphasise that these facts that I have set out are based only on our investigations.&nbsp; They have not yet been proven in court.&nbsp; The answers I can give are also limited for the same reason because the cases are pending in court.&nbsp; I would add that investigations are still ongoing, including investigations into Koh's activities when he was posted to the Supreme Court between 1997 and 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, it was&nbsp;reported in the newspapers&nbsp;that the perpetrators of the fraud were driving opulent and luxurious cars.&nbsp; I find it difficult to understand why no one in the Government agencies had noticed that mid-level executives were driving such cars.&nbsp; Could the Minister clarify whether any measures are being introduced to ensure that regular checks are conducted by either the Chief Executive of the statutory board or other agencies if they detect any suspicious ownership of high-value assets by their staff?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Shanmugam:</B>&nbsp; The Member can be rest assured that if someone drives a Lamborghini to SLA's office, I think it will be picked up.&nbsp; They were careful in that they never drove these cars, from what we understand, to their offices.&nbsp; They took particular care to make sure that nothing in their lifestyle gave anything&nbsp;away.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether he would elaborate on the current practice of internal audits by Ministries on statutory boards and also,&nbsp;in view of this case, whether there would be any increased measures&nbsp;in terms of the regime for internal audit.

First, failure in supervision.&nbsp; Good supervision requires not just knowledge of the Government rules and procedures, but continual vigilance.&nbsp; This vigilance was lacking in those responsible for supervision of the IT Department at SLA and IPOS at the time.&nbsp; Second, there were gaps in internal audit in both agencies.&nbsp; As the Minister for Law has just stated,&nbsp;the Ministry of Law&nbsp;has acted to rectify the shortcomings both in supervision and audit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1471<p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) reviews public sector procurement rules and guidelines on a regular basis.&nbsp; In fact, following the alleged fraud cases at SLA and IPOS, a further review of public sector rules was undertaken.&nbsp; This included a comparison with best practices in the private sector.&nbsp; The review affirmed that the public sector procurement rules, for both quotations and tenders, were fundamentally sound.&nbsp; There are appropriate checks and balances built into the system of procurement based on quotations, and these apply to lower value transactions (in other words, those below $70,000).&nbsp; All public sector agencies follow more stringent processes for larger value procurements, for which tenders have to be called.&nbsp; For example, tenders have to be approved by tender boards comprising three individuals.&nbsp; Tenders account for some 95% of total Government procurement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are nevertheless looking into possible improvements to the system.&nbsp; For example, MOF will encourage agencies to adopt good practices, such as the periodic rotation of officers with procurement responsibilities, whenever feasible. It was, in fact, through a rotation of IDA officers in SLA that irregularities were detected in the recent case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, IDA intends to help agencies, including statutory boards, to strengthen the management and monitoring of IT maintenance services.&nbsp; It will also help them draw up the scope of audit of IT procurement, which is more specialised than other types of procurement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an example of the industry-specific approach that Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef had raised.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even as we seek improvements to the system wherever possible, the safeguards must be workable. We must ensure that procurement can be carried out efficiently, and&nbsp;we do not add layers of bureaucracy to perform more checks <p align=left>Column: 1472<p>and balances.&nbsp; We should do what we practically can to reduce the risk of fraud, but keep Government lean, efficient and responsive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What matters, therefore, is to have a sound and practical set of rules, and to back them up with effective supervision on how they are implemented.&nbsp; This does not mean that a supervisor has to take on the role of approving quotations or transactions personally.&nbsp; But proper and alert supervision will make it less likely that irregularities in budgeting and procurement will pass unnoticed. MOF has reminded all Government agencies of the importance of vigilant supervision of procurement operations to minimise opportunities for fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We nevertheless will not be able to eliminate human lapses in supervision entirely across the public sector.&nbsp; This is why we need a robust system of audit to help detect procurement irregularities as well as deter potential misdoings.&nbsp; Internal audit plays an important role in public agencies, whether undertaken within the organisation or outsourced to commercial auditors.&nbsp; Last year, the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) conducted a review of the governance framework and internal audit practices of statutory boards.&nbsp; Based on its findings, it has established a set of best practices in June this year, which MOF has circulated to all statutory boards.&nbsp;This exercise pre-dated the SLA case coming to light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second level of audit comprises external audits. Statutory boards' financial statements are subject to annual audits by either the Auditor-General or external commercial auditors.&nbsp;These regular annual audits are for the primary purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements and do not focus on&nbsp;internal controls.&nbsp;In addition, therefore, the Auditor-General's Office periodically audits statutory boards in selected areas of internal controls, compliance with <p align=left>Column: 1473<p>regulations and avoidance of waste. Each year, the Auditor-General's Office carries out such audits of all 15 Ministries in Government, all&nbsp;nine Organs of State and around 18 other entities which are mainly statutory boards.&nbsp;The Auditor-General's Office last audited the SLA in FY 2007/08 with the field work being done in 2007. It began its audit of IPOS in December last year, before the recent case of alleged fraud surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General's Office cannot audit all 64 of our statutory boards in all areas of their operations every year, and hence directs resources towards areas of greater significance.&nbsp;In the light of the SLA and IPOS cases, the Auditor-General's Office will re-prioritise the areas being selected for audit in&nbsp;the next audit cycle to give greater attention to IT services procurement and contracts. However, the external audits performed by the Auditor-General's Office serve as an extra layer of check, and are not a substitute for the statutory boards' internal audit responsibilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that soon after the discovery of alleged fraud in SLA, the Government had also performed checks on all transactions involving the two officers suspected of fraud as well as all transactions between public sector agencies and the specific vendors involved in the SLA case.&nbsp; This was indeed how the alleged fraud at IPOS was surfaced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further safeguard, which Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef referred to in her question.&nbsp;We must ensure that channels are open for whistle-blowing, because that too has a role to play in uncovering fraud.&nbsp; Within the Civil Service, there are established channels for officers to provide feedback and report wrongful practices.&nbsp;Officers can report cases of misconduct to their supervisors, the HR <p align=left>Column: 1474<p>department, the Permanent Secretary or the Head of Civil Service.&nbsp; They can also report matters pertaining to conduct and discipline in the Civil Service to the Public Service Commission.&nbsp;Feedback, whether from public officers or external parties, is taken seriously and acted upon.&nbsp;In fact, in response to specific feedback in the past, the Auditor-General has carried out audits of selected financial transactions with the purpose of uncovering irregularities, including fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Public Service has, over the years, established a track record of clean and effective governance.&nbsp;From time to time, however, there have been dishonest public servants, who have found ways to get around the rules for personal gain.&nbsp;The Government takes a very serious view of each such incident. One of the strengths of our system is a robust process of investigation and prosecution, to bring perpetrators of fraud or corruption to justice and deal with them with the full measure of the law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, I am sorry to have taken a bit of time on this&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;there are several elements involved in keeping the integrity of our system of public sector procurement. It takes sound rules and safeguards, operated by upright officers and backed up by conscientious supervision and audit; open channels for possible wrongdoings to be reported; and, finally, the deterrent effect of robust law enforcement.&nbsp;We have a working system, and I assure Members we will keep improving it wherever possible.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I want to thank the Minister for his clarification but I am a little puzzled because the&nbsp;Minister said that there are no gaps in the rules and guidelines.&nbsp; Yet, at the&nbsp;same time, the&nbsp;Minister did say that gaps in the supervision on the part of the supervisors.&nbsp; So, obviously, there is some systemic problem involving supervision of officers for auditing purposes.&nbsp; My second question <p align=left>Column: 1475<p>is: if the Auditor-General cannot audit all the agencies in a particular year, does that also then open the door for such frauds to take place?&nbsp; People know that&nbsp;in a particular year, which statutory boards or agencies are being audited and therefore they do have sometime in order to commit those frauds.&nbsp; My third question is to ask whether this is confined to IPOS and SLA or whether there are other statutory boards involved?&nbsp; Is there a check being done on other statutory boards to see whether there are any other fraudulent attempts on the part of staff in those statutory boards as well.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; <B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B>:&nbsp;First, I do not think they have a systemic problem. As I have explained, the rules and guidelines are in place.&nbsp;They are not out-of-sync with best practices elsewhere, including in our private sector.&nbsp;We will fine-tune and refine them from time to time and, indeed, there are some refinements we are thinking about. But the rules and guidelines are not what explain what happened at SLA and IPOS,&nbsp;and they in fact had practised the&nbsp;rules and guidelines. There was human failure.&nbsp;Human failure, first, in supervision and, second, in audit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There&nbsp;is no reason to believe that these human failures are widespread. But we are alert.&nbsp; MOF has reminded all statutory boards, quite apart from our&nbsp;Ministries, to pay more attention to&nbsp;supervision of procurement.&nbsp;We have provided a detailed checklist of questions that have to be asked on matters of procurement, including procurement of IT and maintenance services.&nbsp;IDA, on its part, is seeing how it can help agencies, including our small statutory boards, to improve the management of IT maintenance services and how we can also strengthen audit of IT maintenance services because this is a more specialised area than procurement in general, or audit in general.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we are seeing how we can improve the system but there is no <p align=left>Column: 1476<p>reason to believe that the problems are systemic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Auditor-General's Office cannot, as Mdm Halimah mentioned, audit all 64 statutory boards in all areas every year.&nbsp;The primary responsibility rests on the statutory board itself.&nbsp; Its internal audit responsibilities are its responsibilities and the board's responsibilities.&nbsp;That of the board and&nbsp;the audit committees'. And it is a requirement for statutory boards to&nbsp;set up&nbsp;audit committees.&nbsp;The Auditor-General's Office&nbsp;provides an important second check. It focuses on selective areas of internal audit in each audit cycle. From time to time it will re-prioritise and, indeed,&nbsp;following the SLA and IPOS' cases, it will be placing more emphasis on IT procurement. But we should try and avoid the temptation to look backwards at the last mistake, at the last mishap, the last occurrence of fraud and focus all our resources on avoiding that.&nbsp;Because it could be something else the next time.&nbsp;So we have got to maintain a balance, keep our priorities and keep people guessing as to what the Auditor-General is going to focus on.&nbsp;The Member&nbsp;had a final question which had to do with other statutory boards.&nbsp;I can assure Mdm Halimah and Members that&nbsp;we have been reminding all our statutory boards of the need for vigilant supervision of procurement operations and, specifically, on IT maintenance operations, the need for vigilant audits of these operations.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p align=\"left\"><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the Minister said that this is a case of human failure or&nbsp;perhaps the supervision problem of the officer concerned.&nbsp; I would like to ask what MOF is doing to deal with the problem of human failure and what are the&nbsp;safeguards to make sure that the supervisors do supervise properly and also, who supervises the supervisors?&nbsp; Second supplementary question, Sir.&nbsp; Does the Minister not agree that as a layman,&nbsp;it will be difficult to understand, despite the internal audit, external audit <p align=left>Column: 1477<p>and whatever stringent rules that MOF lays&nbsp;down on the Civil Service on procurement procedures,&nbsp;and yet this could happen and&nbsp;it is a huge sum of money that is being cheated out of the Government's coffer by the officer and not only in one Ministry, but also in some other agency as well and during such a long period of time?&nbsp; So the question is: what is internal audit, external audit and supervision for?&nbsp; From a layman's point of view, I suppose it should&nbsp;be very stringent and should have&nbsp;prevented all these happenings.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:&nbsp;</B> First, I agree as a general proposition that we should try to minimise the risk of any such occurrence.&nbsp;I think Mr Low will agree with me that there is no system &ndash; private sector or public sector &ndash; which can eliminate it entirely because from time to time there are, unfortunately, lapses in human conduct, and I am not referring to the chaps who allegedly perpetrated fraud but to&nbsp;lapses in supervision. We have got to try and minimise those lapses. But there is only so much you can do through rules and guidelines. For instance, one way of minimising lapses is to have more people involved.&nbsp; For tenders, for instance, for large transactions &ndash; it is a much more robust process.&nbsp;First, robust process of assessing the need&nbsp;for a tender; robust process of assessing the bids that have come in; and the final approval processes are more onerous.&nbsp;Several individuals involved, and&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;several layers of individuals involved. If we do that for every single procurement transaction in the Government, it would really slow things down.&nbsp;It would make Government less efficient and less able to serve the needs of the public.&nbsp;So we have got to make sure the rules and guidelines are sound but focus on backing them up with vigilant supervision.&nbsp;And that is&nbsp;not just an empty pronouncement.&nbsp;We are also providing guidelines on supervision which <p align=left>Column: 1478<p>Ministries and statutory boards should take heed of, and some helpful&nbsp;tips on how to go about supervising procurement operations. Quite specific tips, for instance, on how you search through the data to see if certain companies are appearing too frequently or detect certain trends in the data that should be a red flag.&nbsp;So this is something we are improving but I do not think that we would be able to eliminate all human failure for all time in all agencies.&nbsp;I say that without the slightest suggestion of complacency on our part.&nbsp;We do want to improve and minimise the risk of fraud. I think that answers your question.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Without a printed voting slip, auditing the voting results in the event of a petition to the Election Judge can be problematic.&nbsp; As regards postal voting, there is no guarantee of voting secrecy, as we do not know who marked the ballot paper.&nbsp; It is also difficult to ensure that all ballots&nbsp;will be mailed back to the Elections Department on time to be counted.&nbsp; Missing votes will also cast doubt on the integrity of the process.&nbsp; In the UK where postal voting is permitted, there had been reports of electoral fraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, the paper ballot is still the simplest and most transparent method of <p align=left>Column: 1481<p>voting that can ensure the integrity and secrecy of the voting process.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim (Non-Constituency Member):</B> &nbsp; I wonder whether Deputy Prime Minister Wong could give the House an update on how many eligible voters have registered themselves so far for the coming General Election (GE)?&nbsp; The last round, we had about 1,000-odd voters.&nbsp; So I wonder if he can update us on whether the relaxed criteria has led to a larger number of people registering.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> May I ask when were the 1,000-odd voters made known?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Sylvia Lim</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I was referring to those registered for the previous GE.&nbsp; It was about 1,017.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B>&nbsp; Sir, the previous GE registered only about 550-odd overseas voters and not 1,000-odd.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;</B><B>Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> &nbsp; Sir, can I clarify?&nbsp; I have the data here actually.&nbsp;&nbsp;One thousand and seventeen registered but on Nomination Day only certain constituencies were contested, so that led to 500-over being eligible to vote.&nbsp; That was what I meant.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:&nbsp;</B> Well, from the data I have here, 553 registered to vote before the 2006 GE and this is the data I have but Ms Lim may be right.&nbsp; There may be 1,000-odd that Ms Lim had mentioned.&nbsp; From what I am told now, we have 1,325 Singaporean overseas who are eligible to register to vote have registered.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Viswa Sadasivan (Nominated Member):</B> Could the Minister give his opinion as to whether there is a correlation between the number of people who have registered and the convenience or inconvenience factor in&nbsp;voting?

I understand some of the&nbsp;limitations that the Minister has highlighted. They are reasonable. We need to&nbsp;make sure that we keep election fraud and other such&nbsp;issues&nbsp;at bay. But it is a question&nbsp;of balancing&nbsp;that with continuing to strive to make&nbsp;it easier for our overseas voters to cast their votes. I gather that countries like&nbsp;the United States of America do go out of their way to allow for&nbsp;their voters to cast their votes by mail. I am really wondering whether we would reconsider that because there are quite a few developed countries that do it. &nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, as I have said,&nbsp;postal or mail voting does not guarantee voters' secrecy. So as far as this is concerned, we do not think that that is the path&nbsp;we want to embark&nbsp;on. As to whether we have made it convenient for people to vote or not, and the accessibility of the voting stations, as I think that is the main point: we only set up voting stations overseas where we have a significant number of Singaporeans residing in those countries. We can only provide for that when voting takes place in the Embassy building for good reasons &ndash; safety, security as well as diplomatic&nbsp;immunity that&nbsp;we enjoy. We have 28&nbsp;Missions where we have&nbsp;High Commissions or Embassies in&nbsp;capital cities of large countries, like America or Australia. In some places, we do provide for more than one station, like the US or China, but there is a limit to how far we can stretch and make accessible voting stations in the places where Singaporeans live. So right now, we have nine voting stations. In time, we may increase if there is a significant number residing in those places and if they are eligible to vote. But I think so far, we have tried our best and minimised the inconvenience to them by <p align=left>Column: 1483<p>allowing Singaporeans to register online. When they move to another place or come back to Singapore, all they need to do is to go online&nbsp;and tell the Elections Department that they are in&nbsp;a particular place and the register will be updated again.

It will do so in phases, and will adjust the amounts as economic conditions change. So this is not about US$600 billion being released into the markets all in one shot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fed&rsquo;s latest round of monetary policy easing is not fundamentally different from its actions in 2008 and 2009, when it purchased large amounts of securities although mainly of shorter maturities. Those actions had contributed to stabilising financial conditions in the US and globally, and supported the recovery from the crisis. The Fed hopes that&nbsp;its latest policy measure will lower longer term interest rates and stimulate economic activity&nbsp;&ndash; in particular by making housing more affordable, encouraging corporate investments and raising stock prices and consumer spending. Whether the Fed&rsquo;s measure will be effective remains to be seen. But if the policy does succeed in stimulating a new cycle of growth in the US economy, or&nbsp;at the very least in reducing the risks of a further slowdown in the US economy, it will be positive for Singapore and most other countries in the region. The US remains one of Asia&rsquo;s largest trading partners, and the state of its economy is still a key concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The basic reason why capital flows into Asia have increased, including into Singapore, has to do fundamentally with <p align=left>Column: 1485<p>the very different stages of economic recovery being experienced in different parts of the world economy. Expansionary monetary policies in the industrialised economies, aimed at supporting their still fragile economic recovery and avoiding further escalation in financial market stresses, have led to record low interest rates. In contrast, the Asian and emerging economies generally have rebounded strongly from the crisis and have begun to tighten their macroeconomic policies.&nbsp;The increase in capital flows to the region reflects these underlying divergences, notably the differences in prospects for both growth and inflation between the advanced and emerging economies. Capital has flowed to this part of the world in search of higher returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policymakers in the region are fully aware of the risks posed by the increased capital flows. Much of it has comprised short-term investments rather than longer term, direct investments, and can hence be volatile and easily reversed. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)&nbsp;had taken into account this volatility in global financial markets in its most recent monetary policy move in October, which involved a widening of the band in which the&nbsp;Singapore-dollar exchange rate can fluctuate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The capital inflows are generally being intermediated efficiently through our domestic financial markets and banking system.&nbsp;Nevertheless, we are closely monitoring the impact of capital flows on the economy and especially our asset markets. We are not contemplating introducing capital controls, but will continue to rely on a range of policy tools to ensure that capital flows do not threaten financial stability or cause a property market bubble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With our economic recovery more firmly entrenched, the Government has <p align=left>Column: 1486<p>been withdrawing the expansionary macroeconomic policies implemented during the crisis.&nbsp;As Members know, we have also introduced a series of pre-emptive measures since September&nbsp;last year&nbsp;aimed at promoting a more stable and sustainable property market.&nbsp;These have had some calming effect on the market.&nbsp;The Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional steps, if necessary, to ensure financial stability and sustainable asset markets.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Sir, I thank the Minister for the reassuring reply. While&nbsp;I understand that as an international financial centre, we do experience outflows and inflows. My further question to the Minister is whether in the midst of these in- and outflows, how much is leaked to the local markets and, hence, driving up the asset prices and&nbsp;Singapore dollar? Secondly, whether it is the case where the foreign capital inflows are more short term and \"hot money\" in nature, while the outflows which&nbsp;may come from local sources, are longer term in&nbsp;the investment horizon?&nbsp;Hence, the related question is what will happen if US begins to unwind its quantitative easing?

In fact, some of it goes back to the developed countries' market themselves, including the United States. The main reason&nbsp;for concern&nbsp;on asset markets, which is not just a short-term concern but&nbsp;may be with us for quite a&nbsp;while, is that&nbsp;interest rates are extremely low. And that&nbsp;is a function&nbsp;of easy monetary policies in the US and the <p align=left>Column: 1487<p>developed world.&nbsp;Our three month deposit rates are about&nbsp;0.2%-0.3%, and inter-bank rates are barely higher. So we&nbsp;have extremely low&nbsp;interest rates on deposits in the banking system, and that leads to investors, including households, wanting to search for&nbsp;yield somewhere else. That is the problem&nbsp;we have to address for some time to come. It means&nbsp;we have to&nbsp;be vigilant&nbsp;to the possibility of&nbsp;a property market bubble and take further measures when necessary. The MAS has a good handle on&nbsp;its prudential regulation of our banks, so that we&nbsp;are not really concerned, at least not fundamentally concerned about&nbsp;&ndash; systematic stability in our financial&nbsp;system. We are concerned about property prices rising too quickly&nbsp;and too far. Our three rounds of measures so far have been aimed and injecting some stability into that process. &nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Sylvia Lim--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim:</B> Thank you, Sir.

There are also some food price shocks because of shortages in supply in the region, including in China. Thirdly, Ms Sylvia Lim does have a point in that easy monetary policy in the developed world has a way of leading to flows of liquidity all around the world and, sooner or later, flows of liquidity lead to more purchases of goods and services. Demand is picking up partly because the interest rates are very low, and people are looking for other things to buy, and that tends to force&nbsp;prices up over time.

They stated that the proposed combination of SGX and ASX would bring together complementary businesses and their respective strengths to serve investors better and leverage on economic growth in the Asia Pacific. They noted that although the ASX and SGX would remain separate legal entities and would be locally regulated, the merger would diversify the product and customer bases of both exchanges. For example, the merger would offer investors access to the second largest listing venue in Asia Pacific with over 2,700 listed companies from 20 countries, including more than 900 natural resource companies and the largest number of REITs and exchange-traded funds in the Asia Pacific. SGX and <p align=left>Column: 1489<p>ASX also said that a combined group will enhance its attractiveness as a partner of choice for future exchange industry collaboration, to tap into strong regional growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government cannot judge the commercial merits of the proposed merger. The commercial merits will be decided by the respective shareholders of the two entities. Indeed, the transaction would need to be approved by the requisite majorities of the shareholders of both SGX and ASX.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regulators on both sides would also need to be satisfied that the proposed transaction meets all regulatory requirements in their own jurisdictions. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) objectives as the markets regulator are spelled out in the Securities and Futures Act, as part of its overall mandate of fostering a sound and reputable financial centre. This means that MAS&nbsp;has to be satisfied that the Exchange remains able&nbsp; to maintain efficient and transparent&nbsp; markets,&nbsp;and is able to minimise systemic risks. In Australia, the tradition regulatory objectives, the transaction also needs the approval from the Australian parliament, and would have to pass the scrutiny of the Foreign Investment Review Board.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">        \t      \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B></span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MANAGING INFLATION--><p align=left>Column: 1489<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MANAGING INFLATION:::1492--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>MANAGING INFLATION</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The Government will continue to provide a favourable environment for businesses to thrive and for our economy to grow.&nbsp; At the same time, we also need the businesses and Singaporean workers to play their part in raising productivity, which will help mitigate the inflationary effects of wage increases in a tightening labour market.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

The second thing is to ensure that the markets remain competitive.&nbsp; In other words, we have a competitive market for food products in Singapore as well and that will ensure that we are always given a supply of food which is competitively-priced, not necessarily lowly-priced because it depends on what the global market prices are.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat</B>:&nbsp; Sir, our ERP system helps to ensure smooth-flowing traffic on our roads by managing the demand for driving.&nbsp; As the demand for driving changes over time, the&nbsp;Land Transport Authority (LTA)&nbsp;reviews the ERP rates on a quarterly basis in February, May, August and November as well as for the two major school holidays in June and December.&nbsp; ERP rates are adjusted up or down, when necessary, to maintain traffic speeds within the optimal speed ranges.&nbsp; The optimal speed ranges of 45 kph to 65 kph for expressways and 20 kph&nbsp;to 30 kph for other roads, were determined taking into account the physical capacity of the roads.&nbsp; They are calibrated to allow the optimal number of vehicles on the roads while ensuring that traffic flow does not degenerate into start-stop situations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the recent fourth quarter review where ERP rates were raised for some half hour timeslots, LTA had carried out traffic speed measurements of the relevant roads over a two-week period in October, and from these data, determined that traffic speeds had fallen below the optimal range.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regular reviews of ERP rates provide a self-adjusting mechanism, based on prevailing traffic conditions, to ensure that ERP continues to be effective in <p align=left>Column: 1494<p>maintaining smooth traffic flow on our roads.&nbsp; To answer Ms Irene Ng, traffic speeds on the CTE have been consistently maintained within the optimal range of 45 kph&nbsp;to 65 kph during the ERP operating hours.&nbsp; If we look across nationwide, we have been able to keep at least 95% of our road network within that optimal range during the morning peak hours.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua asked whether we should review the optimal speed range to reflect the higher traffic due to population growth.&nbsp; This is not prudent as the optimal speed ranges are determined based on the physical capacity of the roads.&nbsp; Allowing a lower speed threshold because of population growth will simply lead to poorer service levels on our roads and more widespread congestion, as the physical capacity of the roads remain unchanged.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not, however, rely solely on ERP.&nbsp; We adopt a holistic approach to meet the needs of a rising population and increased economic activities, with ERP being considered only as a last resort.&nbsp; Existing roads are widened or new roads are built wherever possible.&nbsp; However, given our land constraints, relying on public transport which is the more efficient way to cater to our growing transport needs has to be the way forward.&nbsp; And that is why the Government is spending $60 billion to double our rail network in the next 10 to 15 years.&nbsp; We are also putting in more priority measures on the roads to speed up bus travel such as extending bus lanes and the Mandatory Give Way to Buses scheme to more locations.&nbsp; At the same time, we recognise that vehicle population growth has to be managed.&nbsp; Therefore, we have also lowered vehicle population growth rate from 3% to 1.5% per annum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is no silver bullet here to ensure smooth-flowing traffic.&nbsp; Instead, all these measures are necessary to ensure that Singaporeans continue to enjoy a <p align=left>Column: 1495<p>high quality living environment in one of the most densely populated city states in the world.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mr Speaker, Sir, concessionary travel on basic bus and train services are determined and granted by the public transport operators (PTOs).&nbsp; As the costs of such concessions are cross-subsidised by other full-fare paying commuters, the operators would have to take this into consideration when implementing any change to the concessionary schemes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, pre-schoolers who are above the height of 0.9 metre and below the age of seven years&nbsp;enjoy concessionary travel through Child Concession Cards which can be purchased at any TransitLink ticket office.&nbsp; These allow pre-schoolers, regardless of their height, to travel at concessionary rates on public transport. Once they enter primary schools at seven years old, they will continue to enjoy concessionary fares as students.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the height limit, only infants in arms travelled for free on buses previously.&nbsp; Since the introduction of the MRT system, sensors on our MRT fare gates prevent the gates from accidentally closing onto a commuter passing through.&nbsp; This is to ensure the safety of commuters.&nbsp; These sensors have been installed at a height of 0.9 metre and children below 0.9 metre may first pass through the opened gates safely, followed by a fare-paying adult commuter.&nbsp; Therefore, it was decided that children up to 0.9 metre in height who are accompanied by a full-fare paying passenger could be allowed to travel free on the MRT system.&nbsp; To ensure consistency across the different modes of travel, bus operators extended free travel from infants in arms to children up to 0.9 metre in height on buses as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for raising the height limit of 0.9 metre so that more children can enjoy free travel, the cost of such free travel will have to be cross-subsidised by other full-fare paying commuters.&nbsp; Similar to other <p align=left>Column: 1497<p>concessionary schemes, this is something the operators would have to consider carefully.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the Government encourages the public transport operators to extend concessions where they are able to do so.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Mildred Tan (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Mas Selamat thought that Nur Aini was living alone.&nbsp; He believed that Asmom and his wife were living in their house in Johor while Asmom&rsquo;s son (ie, Mas Selamat&rsquo;s nephew), Mahadir, was overseas.&nbsp; Mas Selamat believed that it would be safe for him at Asmom&rsquo;s house as only Nur Aini would be there and that she would render assistance to him.&nbsp; However, Asmom, his wife Aisah, their daughter Nur Aini and son Mahadir were all living in Asmom&rsquo;s home. They have all independently admitted that Mas Selamat had stayed overnight in their home between 29th February and 1st March 2008.&nbsp; Asmom, Aisah and Nur Aini have also admitted that they had harboured Mas Selamat, providing him with shelter, food, money and clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will set out their respective roles in harbouring and aiding Mas Selamat on those two days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Nur Aini</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Nur Aini.&nbsp; Nur Aini&nbsp;had let Mas Selamat into the flat.&nbsp; Her mother, Aisah, had reservations about allowing Mas Selamat into the flat because by that time his escape two days earlier and fugitive status were very public.&nbsp; She knew that it was wrong to help him.&nbsp; Nur Aini, however, persuaded her mother to allow Mas Selamat to enter the flat.&nbsp; She gave him the use of her bedroom, provided him with&nbsp;food and water, and also assisted him by destroying material evidence, namely, the clothing he wore to the flat, which included his WRDC-issued attire.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 1st March 2008, before Mas Selamat left the flat, Nur Aini applied make-up on Mas Selamat, secured a <I>tudung</I> (headscarf) over his head so that he could disguise himself as a woman to evade detection and recapture.&nbsp; She also gave him several items, which included a set of clothes to wear, a baseball cap,<div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols. 1587-1596.<BR></div> <p align=left>Column: 1501<p>water, snack, an illumination stick, air-tight re-sealable plastic bags to pack the items and a backpack which he used to store all these items.&nbsp; At Mas Selamat&rsquo;s request, she also handed to him a map of Singapore that showed part of Malaysia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Asmom</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will turn to Asmon now.&nbsp; Asmom jointly owned the flat with his wife Aisah.&nbsp; He found out about Mas Selamat&rsquo;s presence in the flat when he returned from work in the early hours of 1st March 2008.&nbsp; He knew it was wrong to harbour Mas Selamat, was unhappy about Mas Selamat's presence&nbsp;but eventually decided to allow Mas Selamat to stay in his flat.&nbsp; Before Mas Selamat left the flat on 1st March 2008, Asmom gave him S$100 and RM100 to facilitate his escape from Singapore to Malaysia.&nbsp; He also gave Mas Selamat some traditional medicine which the latter kept in his backpack.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Aisah</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Aisah.&nbsp; Aisah is a joint-owner of the flat with Asmom.&nbsp; She was initially reluctant to allow Mas Selamat to enter the flat on 29th February. But she nevertheless subsequently went along and helped Mas Selamat.&nbsp; She gave him an EZ-link card and a hair-net which he wore as part of his disguise, and some paracetamol.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Mahadir</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Mahadir.&nbsp; Mahadir&nbsp;had returned home to the flat on the night of 29th February.&nbsp; He&nbsp;became aware that his family members were harbouring Mas Selamat in their flat.&nbsp; He did not report the matter to the authorities.&nbsp; However, neither did he render any specific assistance to Mas Selamat, and nor was he in the flat most of the time when Mas Selamat was taking refuge in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1502<p> The independent accounts of Mas Selamat, Asmom, Aisah, Nur Aini and Mahadir of what took place in Asmom&rsquo;s flat and the assistance rendered to Mas Selamat are consistent.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Information still under investigation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to how Mas Selamat made his way to Asmom&rsquo;s flat and how he subsequently made his way to Malaysia, the account given by Mas Selamat is still subject to verification.&nbsp; It would, therefore, not be productive to set it out at this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Offence&nbsp;committed by Asmom and family</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmom, Aisah and Nur Aini had knowingly harboured Mas Selamat, an escaped prisoner of the State, who they knew was the subject of a massive manhunt.&nbsp; Even after Mas Selamat left their flat on the evening of 1st March 2008, they did not reveal information concerning Mas Selamat to the authorities.&nbsp; On the contrary, they deliberately withheld the information when they were interviewed by the authorities on 3rd March 2008.&nbsp; It was only in October 2010, after being confronted with the facts, that Asmom, Aisah, Nur Aini and Mahadir admitted to what had happened.&nbsp; Asmom&rsquo;s and his family&rsquo;s decision to harbour Mas Selamat and provide him with material support that enabled him to escape to Malaysia was very wrong, illegal and had grave security implications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mas Selamat is a hardened and dangerous terrorist who has been involved in various plots by the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) to mount terrorist attacks in Singapore since the 1990s.&nbsp; He is operationally trained and has undergone training not once but twice in Al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.&nbsp; After the Singapore authorities disrupted the Singapore JI network in December 2001 and averted the terrorist plot to conduct simultaneous truck bomb attacks in Singapore, Mas Selamat plotted to mount retaliatory <p align=left>Column: 1503<p>attacks against Singapore.&nbsp; Harbouring Mas Selamat and assisting him to escape from Singapore placed Singapore&rsquo;s and Singaporeans&rsquo; security in serious jeopardy as Mas Selamat would thereby be able to resume his terrorist activities of attacking Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Criminal offence committed</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government had stated in Parliament on 28th February 2008 that anyone who rendered assistance to Mas Selamat would be committing a \"grave offence\".&nbsp; Nur Aini, Asmom and Aisah were arrested and charged on 10th November 2010 under section 130&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Penal Code for their roles in knowingly harbouring Mas Selamat, a prisoner of State. The three pleaded guilty to the charges and were convicted and sentenced on 18th November 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; For their actions, Nur Aini, Asmom and Aisah have been sentenced to 18 months, 12 months and 3 months of imprisonment, respectively. Mahadir, who had a lesser role in the matter, has been served with a stern warning in lieu of prosecution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Singaporeans will be undoubtedly disappointed that Asmom and his family had helped Mas Selamat in his escape.&nbsp; Their actions are, however,&nbsp;not a reflection on the wider Malay-Muslim community who had disapproved of Mas Selamat&rsquo;s actions and participated in the manhunt for him in 2008.&nbsp; We should therefore not allow this episode to affect the trust and goodwill that has been built up over the years between our different communities. Instead, this episode should reinforce how important it is for every Singaporean to unite together and assist the security agencies to overcome the threat of terrorism from a small number of persons in our society.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, I have made it clear that the three individuals committed a criminal offence of harbouring a prisoner of state.&nbsp; The threat Mas Selamat posed was a threat that was posed to Singapore as a whole and for all the communities in Singapore.&nbsp; His actions put all Singaporeans at risk.&nbsp; As such, all Singaporeans across the communities will feel disappointed with the actions of Asmom and his family.&nbsp; Their actions should not be projected on the&nbsp;Malay/Muslim community at large.&nbsp; I had said earlier that&nbsp;many members of the Malay/Muslim community assisted in the hunt for Mas Selamat in 2008.&nbsp; The general response of the Malay/Muslim community showed that they view Mas Selamat in the same way that other communities do.&nbsp; Therefore, we have to look at this harbouring of Mas Selamat by Asmom and his family in context, and we cannot allow the actions of these three persons to affect the state of communal relations, and the trust and goodwill that has been built up over many years between our various communities, especially between Muslim and non-Muslim communities. We will continue to emphasise the importance of good race relations for the security and progress of Singapore.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> I would like to ask the Minister what efforts will be made <p align=left>Column: 1507<p>to extend rehabilitation services to those members of the Asmom family in terms of the Religious Rehabilitation Group's (RRG) efforts in this area as well.&nbsp;</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Shanmugam:</B> Counselling services will be offered to them.&nbsp; And though there is no specific evidence of them being influenced by radical JI ideology, religious counselling will also be offered to them.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Sir, I was actually going to ask whether there will be any monitoring and counselling programmes for the family.&nbsp; I think that was asked by Mdm Halimah.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman):</B> Mr Speaker, it is quite shocking to receive this news that Mas Selamat had actually been assisted by his extended family members, given the fact that all of Singapore were concerned during that period and the massive manhunt that took place.&nbsp; But I would like to first thank&nbsp;the Minister for being open and sharing this news on the case with us and I am sure the Minister will continue to share such pertinent information with Singaporeans.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do have several questions that probably&nbsp;are in the minds of Singaporeans when they read&nbsp;the news tonight and tomorrow, specifically with regard to&nbsp;the family members.&nbsp; Firstly, were&nbsp;Asmom and his family members forthcoming when confronted with the evidence of this abetment of Mas Selamat's&nbsp;escape to Malaysia?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, given the&nbsp;seriousness and graveness of the offence, I just wonder whether the Minister feels that the punishment for the Asmom and his family members was too lenient.&nbsp; I think we have heard the Minister repeatedly mention that Mas Selamat is a prisoner of state.&nbsp;&nbsp;Imprisonments of&nbsp;18 months and 12 <p align=left>Column: 1508<p>months seem a little light, given the seriousness of the offence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, is regarding&nbsp;the daughter of Asmom, Nur Aini.&nbsp; Given her deepest involvement in harbouring Mas Selamat, I wonder if the&nbsp;Minister could give us some&nbsp;background about her and what she did,&nbsp;for us to have a sense as to why a person like her would make a decision to help and abet a prisoner of state and&nbsp;remain silent for the next two years before we got information on her.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Shanmugam:</B> Sir, when they were interviewed in March&nbsp;2008, obviously they were not forthcoming.&nbsp; However, when confronted with the facts in October of this year, they independently verified and confirmed to having harboured Mas Selamat, and this was not only said to the interviewers.&nbsp; They made their statements to the magistrate who took down their statements and so it was independently verified and they were prepared to say those things to a magistrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do not know how to characterise it as whether they were forthcoming or not, but they were prepared to tell the truth when it was clear that the truth was out.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question that Dr Maliki had was whether the sentences were too light, given the seriousness of the offence.&nbsp; We have to&nbsp;remember one fact, which is that the sentences were meted out by the Court. They were based on submissions by both the prosecution and the defence, and the sentences, in our view, reflect the different degrees of involvement of the family in harbouring and aiding Mas Selamat.&nbsp; Nur Aini was obviously the most culpable. She has been given the longest jail sentence.&nbsp; The other two received shorter sentences probably because of their lesser involvement.&nbsp; The Court is likely to have given weight to the fact that the assistance was not premeditated.&nbsp; Rather, the three persons appeared to have acted <p align=left>Column: 1509<p>on misguided instincts of family ties on the spur of the moment.&nbsp; Aisah was reluctant to let Mas Selamat in.&nbsp; She is a housewife who was persuaded by Nur Aini, and it appears that Asmom may also have been initially unhappy about Mas Selamat being in the flat though he allowed Mas Selamat to stay.&nbsp; But having said that, they did commit a serious offence and have thus been given custodial sentences.&nbsp; Mahadir was issued with a stern warning in lieu of prosecution.&nbsp; He had not reported to the authorities that Mas Selamat was in his family's flat.&nbsp; But unlike the others, he also did not render any specific assistance to Mas Selamat and was not in the flat most of the time when Mas Selamat was taking refuge in it.&nbsp; His culpability is less severe than the rest of the family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Maliki also wanted to know,&nbsp;being shocked by Nur Aini's conduct, what did she do and what was her background.&nbsp; At that time that she harboured Mas Selamat, Nur Aini was a trainee teacher.&nbsp; At the time of her arrest this year, she was working as a Malay Language teacher.&nbsp; There is, however, no indication that either she or her parents subscribed to the radical ideology held by Mas Selamat.&nbsp; They had failed to differentiate right from wrong when they decided to help Mas Selamat.&nbsp; They should have known better.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Viswa Sadasivan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, I want to be very clear that we rule nothing out.&nbsp; We can only go on the basis of current evidence and current investigations and that is the best I can say on the basis of current investigations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to what lessons there are based on this episode, I think a number of statements had been made by Deputy Prime Minister Wong.&nbsp; The escape itself was obviously the focus.&nbsp; If I can summarise it,&nbsp;I think it was due to some oversight and complacency setting in at WRDC, and it is a point from which both ISD and the agencies have a lot of take-<p align=left>Column: 1511<p>aways and, as a result, many changes have been made and WRDC itself is a very different institution right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the key take-away from all of this is, each time a lapse occurs, we analyse what happened and we are determined not to repeat it and also do not allow ourselves to be brought down by that.&nbsp; As a result, ISD redoubled its efforts to make sure that they recovered from the fact that Mas Selamat escaped, and that was why through their efforts, we were able to get him back, albeit also with the assistance of the Malaysian authorities.&nbsp; But ISD never doubted that they could get him back and they did so.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Ellen Lee (Sembawang):</B> Without casting aspersions on the Police force which I have got the greatest respect for, the Minister mentioned that Mas Selamat had not been in contact with this family for a number of years or for quite sometime, and the fact that four persons had been able to maintain their cool, when they were interrogated shortly after they had let Mas Selamat out of their house, would have shown that perhaps the interrogation process had been perfunctory or because the manpower was stretched that&nbsp;less than competent officers had been deployed to get in touch with these people.&nbsp;

The Bill will amend the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) Act, or the EEI Act in short. It will <p align=left>Column: 1515<p>put into effect three tax changes announced in previous Budget Statements. It will also make other technical changes to the Act. I will now describe each of the proposed amendments in turn. <p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Enhancement of Investment Allowance</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill extends the maximum period within which companies can qualify their fixed capital expenditure in hire-purchase transactions for Investment Allowance (IA) from five years to eight years.&nbsp;IA incentivises capital investments by companies by providing companies with additional capital allowances, for approved projects, that can be offset against their taxable incomes. Other than with specified exceptions, the legislation currently states that fixed capital expenditure must be incurred within a qualifying period of five years to be considered for IA.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been assessed that it is not uncommon that companies, especially small and medium enterprises, carrying out fixed capital expenditure through hire-purchase transactions can do so over a hire-purchase period of up to eight years.&nbsp;Thus, to better meet the needs of companies, the maximum qualifying period for IA will be revised from five years to eight years for hire-purchase transactions. Clause 4 of the Bill amends Section 68 of the EEI Act to give legislative effect to this enhancement.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><I>Inclusion of energy efficiency projects into IA scheme</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill also expands on the list of the qualifying activities for IA to include energy efficiency projects. As a small, open economy, Singapore is a price taker in the global energy market and will be subject to the upward trend in energy prices. Adopting more energy efficient means of production will help businesses <p align=left>Column: 1516<p>deal with rising energy costs. Energy efficiency is also an important component in our efforts to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions. However, high capital costs and long pay-back periods can discourage energy efficiency investments. This amendment, therefore, aims to encourage more investments in energy efficiency projects by companies in Singapore. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 67 of the EEI Act to give legislative effect to this enhancement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Renewal of IA for aircraft rotables</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA incentive for aircraft rotables was introduced in 2004 to develop the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) sector for the aerospace industry. Aircraft rotables are replacement parts used in the maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircrafts.&nbsp;The incentive expired on 9th September 2009 and it has earlier been announced in Budget 2010 that the incentive will be renewed for another&nbsp;five years effective from 1st April 2010.&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill gives effect to this renewal.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><I>Repealing obsolete incentives</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three incentives &ndash; the Export of Services Incentive, the Overseas Investment Incentive as well as the Research&nbsp;and Development and Intellectual Property Management Hub Incentive &ndash; have expired and will be repealed. These changes are reflected in clauses 2, 6 and 7 of the Bill.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><I>Consequential amendments</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 97(h) of the EEI Act now makes reference to \"qualifying services\" as defined in section 44(a) of the EEI Act which relates to the Export of Services Incentive. With the repeal of the Export of Services Incentive, section 97(h) therefore has to be amended to include in full the \"qualifying services\" presently <p align=left>Column: 1517<p>defined in section 44(a). Clause 5 of the Bill relates to this change.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed changes to the Economic Expansion Incentives Act seek to stimulate more economic activity in Singapore.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order for Second Reading read.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Charities Act was last amended in 2006 and brought into effect on 1st March 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1518<p><p><I>Key aims of amendments</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill before this House today has three objectives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, to facilitate charities and charity board members in their work by providing clarity on their roles and responsibilities and to protect them from personal liability if they have acted honestly and in good faith.&nbsp; We hope this will encourage more good people to come forward and to&nbsp;contribute their time and resources to do good work for society.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, to enhance the accountability and governance in the charity sector.&nbsp; This will include establishing the legislative framework for putting in place accounting standards for charities and Institutes of Public Character (IPCs).&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, and perhaps most important of all, to strengthen charity regulation to better protect donors and to maintain public confidence in the charity sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would now like to draw the attention of the House to the main clauses in the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Protecting governing board members from personal liability</I>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our charity board members are doing beneficial work for society, and many of them are doing so without any remuneration.&nbsp; These board members should enjoy some degree of legal protection if they have acted honestly and responsibly in their charitable work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current Charities Act already provides a layer of protection.&nbsp; Proceedings against a charity or charity board members involving issues related to breaches of trust would require the Commissioner&rsquo;s authorisation.&nbsp; In general, these proceedings will not be authorised if a case can be dealt with using the powers <p align=left>Column: 1519<p>under the Charities Act.&nbsp; This helps avoid the need for the charity and&nbsp;its board members to become embroiled in Court proceedings if there is a better, less expensive and more practical alternative.&nbsp; In addition, the Courts have broad powers to strike out frivolous or vexatious cases, including those made against charities and their board members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide another layer of protection, clause 15 inserts a new section 32A to apply protection currently available under various other Acts to all charity board members under the Charities Act.&nbsp; If the Court finds that a charity board member has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, that he should fairly be excused for negligence, default or a breach of duty, then the&nbsp;Court may relieve him either wholly or partly from his liability on such terms as the Court thinks fit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These existing provisions in the Charities Act, along with the new section 32A, will help provide greater assurance to existing board members, so that they will continue to serve in the charity sector without impediment or reservation.&nbsp; It will also send a positive signal to potential board members and, hopefully, encourage capable and well-meaning individuals to step forth and serve on charity boards.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Clarifying roles and responsibilities of charity board members</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also intend to clarify some of the terms used in the Charities Act.&nbsp; Currently, some of the terms used may not be easily understood by the charity sector.&nbsp; For example, the existing Act defines the term \"charity trustees\" as persons having the general control and management of the administration of a charity.&nbsp; This term includes volunteers serving on the charity board as well as key officers&nbsp;and employees&nbsp;of the charity, which is different from the definition of <p align=left>Column: 1520<p>\"trustees\" used under the Trustees Act.&nbsp; In addition, under the Charities Act, the term \"trusts\" means the provisions that establish and regulate the purpose and administration of a charity.&nbsp; Again, the same term has different meanings under the Trustees Act.&nbsp; To reduce the possibility of confusion, various clauses of the Bill, including clauses 2, 9 to 14 and 23, replace the term \"charity trustees\" with \"governing board members\", and the term \"trusts\" is replaced&nbsp;with \"governing instruments\".&nbsp; The term \"key officers\" is also included where applicable, to clarify the roles and responsibilities of board members and key officers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also want to streamline our administrative requirements to facilitate the charities&rsquo; operations.&nbsp; Currently, most charities have a provision in their governing instruments stating that the Commissioner&rsquo;s approval is required before amendments are made to their governing instruments.&nbsp; In the event that the Commissioner chooses to delegate this power to the Sector Administrator, clause 3 aligns the governing instrument provision with the delegation so as to allow the Sector Administrator to approve these amendments.&nbsp; This allows charities to approach a single agency, which will usually be their Sector Administrator, for their general charity administrative needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Accounting standards and audit requirements</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also be establishing the legislative framework on accounting standards for charities.&nbsp; The Accounting Standards Council (ASC) was established in 2007 under the Accounting Standards Act to issue accounting standards for companies, charities, co-operatives and societies.&nbsp; The ASC has developed the Charities Accounting Standard which is tailored specifically for the charity sector.&nbsp; While the Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (SFRS) remain relevant for some of the bigger charities, the Charities <p align=left>Column: 1521<p>Accounting Standard will simplify the accounting needs of smaller charities.&nbsp; Over the longer term, it will also increase the level of transparency, comparability and accountability in the financial reporting of charities in Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill allows us to put in place the regulatory framework on accounting standards for charities and IPCs, so that we can be ready when the Charities Accounting Standard is launched next year.&nbsp; This clause will also allow us to coordinate the requirements under the Charities Act and the Companies Act.&nbsp; For instance, while charities which are registered as companies will be allowed to choose between the Charities Accounting Standard and the SFRS in future, the penalty for non-compliance with the accounting standards will be similar to that under both the Companies Act and the Charities Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At this juncture, I should also mention that I will be moving a Notice of Amendment shortly after this in the Committee stage.&nbsp; The Amendment will allow us to align our penalty with the Companies Act, specifically for offences relating to non-compliance with accounting standards and which are committed with intent to defraud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here, I would like to assure Members that we have no intention of introducing overly stringent requirements that will unduly inconvenience charities.&nbsp; As a start, only the larger IPCs and charities which are registered as companies will be affected.&nbsp; Today, these IPCs and charities already have to comply with an established accounting standard.&nbsp; In fact, they will be able to enjoy&nbsp;greater flexibility by being able to choose between the Charities Accounting Standard and the SFRS depending on which is more relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1522<p><p><I>Imposing basic requirements on exempt charities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, under clauses 6 and 7, we will require exempt charities to keep their accounting records for at least&nbsp;five years, and to submit their annual reports and statements of accounts to the Commissioner every year.&nbsp; There are currently about 140 exempt charities.&nbsp; These are mainly educational institutions, hospitals or religious bodies established by an Act of Parliament or institutions that have been declared to be exempt charities under a Notification Order.&nbsp; These exempt charities enjoy the same income and property tax exemption as registered charities.&nbsp; The changes mentioned above will bring them in line with the other registered charities and encourage greater transparency and public accountability in the charity sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Protecting donors and the public</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, we will enhance protection to donors and the public, so as to maintain a high level of public confidence in the charity sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;Part VII of the Charities Act on \"Control of Fund-raising for Charitable Institutions\"&nbsp;was not brought into force previously as it was deemed that the phenomenon of commercial fund-raisers and commercial participators was rare.&nbsp; However, over the past few years, the Office of the Commissioner has seen an increase in the number of complaints on the conduct of fund-raising appeals by commercial fund-raisers.&nbsp; Clause 16 will repeal Part VII, which is based on the 1992 UK Charities Act.&nbsp; We will, instead, be incorporating its provisions into our regulations in order to strengthen our existing protection for charities and donors, and to give us more flexibility in updating them as and when necessary, according to the considerations and requirements of the charity sector and the demands of the donating public.&nbsp; These <p align=left>Column: 1523<p>provisions will require the commercial fund-raiser or commercial participator to sign an agreement with a charity before embarking on the fund-raising exercise.&nbsp; The agreement has to spell out arrangements such as the fund-raiser&rsquo;s remuneration and the time period within which collected donations have to be handed over to the charity.&nbsp; The provisions will also, under certain specified conditions, allow donors to cancel their payments to commercial fund-raisers or participators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, clause 19 will empower the Commissioner to require fund-raisers to furnish information required for investigations, which are conducted, for example, in response to public complaints.&nbsp; At the moment, the Commissioner&rsquo;s powers to call for documents and search records under section 9 of the Charities Act can only be exercised on documents or records that relate specifically&nbsp;to a charity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Holding out as registered charity or IPC</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also want to deter the unscrupulous from using the good name of charities and IPCs to gain credibility and support from the public.&nbsp; Clause 21 inserts a new section to penalise institutions which mis-represent themselves as registered charities or IPCs, or persons acting or purporting to act for the institutions, such as their fund-raisers.&nbsp; This will deter them from attempting to mislead the public by pretending to be a charity or IPC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by stating that the charity sector is an integral part of&nbsp;our Government&rsquo;s \"Many Helping Hands\" approach.&nbsp; The charity sector plays&nbsp;a very&nbsp;important role in serving the beneficial interest of the community at large.&nbsp; And the Government is therefore fully committed to promoting the growth of the charity sector and we will do so by adopting a facilitative and balanced <p align=left>Column: 1524<p>regulatory framework, which enhances public confidence without stifling volunteerism and the good work that is already&nbsp;being performed by &nbsp;the charity sector.&nbsp; The amendments we are making to the Act will improve the transparency of the sector and above all, ensure that donors, volunteers and the general public are protected, so that they can continue to donate and to support&nbsp;the charity sector with confidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It will certainly reduce the misinterpretation of definitions within this Bill.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of the 140 charitable bodies that were mentioned by the Minister, I would like to ask, Sir, if many of these organisations are large charities and what is the definition of \"exempt charities\".</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 15 inserts a new section 32A where board members are granted relief from personal liability after the proper investigations have been carried out &ndash;&nbsp;I am sure many will welcome this.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people are invited to sit on the boards of organisations related to the charity sector because of their commitment, track record and capabilities.&nbsp; Board members may not necessarily be involved in the day-to-day operations of the charities which they join. Hence, this is an appropriate change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also in line with the Trustees Act (under the Companies Act) and the Business Trust Act.&nbsp; This Act should send <div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr>*Cols. 1623-1624.<BR></div><p align=left>Column: 1525<p>a message to everyone that even though we implement measures to tighten the regulations but, at the same time, some flexibility with a light touch approach is still required in certain situations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can I suggest that there be a roving panel of financial advisers? Charities can call and ask them&nbsp;for advice if they run into issues, especially financial issues.&nbsp; Maybe these financial advisers can be tapped upon for help before problems arise in areas of finance or accounting.&nbsp; This will build a solid defensive barrier for the welfare bodies and, furthermore, the charity sector in its own may lack sufficient trained personnel to perform such duties professionally.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all, Mr Speaker, I support this Bill.</p></P></span></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.14 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Siong Seng (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to declare my interest as the Chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Foundation.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Given the few high profile charity mismanagement in the last few years, this is indeed a timely reminder of the fallibility of humans and the temptations in the handling of public funds. &nbsp;I realise that there will never be a perfect solution as the system can always be outsmarted.&nbsp; However, having the necessary safeguards in place will go a long way towards restoring the trust and confidence of the public. The survival of charities is dependent on public generosity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is now an increased support in charitable giving.&nbsp; This is clearly shown in the latest annual report by the Commissioner of Charities.&nbsp; Despite the downturn last year, the report revealed an increase in individual donations in the charity sector.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the fund-raising field <p align=left>Column: 1526<p>shapes up to be more competitive, it is inevitable that organisers will seek ways to boost exposure, which include television extravaganzas and mass participation events, so as to capture a slice of the growing pie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the expected increase in the flow of funds to charities, the measures introduced to deliver more teeth to the Charities Act will send a strong signal that systemic weakness will not be condoned while lifting corporate governance in this sector.&nbsp;Greater transparency will also go a long way towards assuring the public that donations, both in cash and kind, are properly accounted for.&nbsp; However, I would like to recommend two areas that could further improve the internal financial controls of charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take as an example financial supervision for Board of Directors of Charities.&nbsp; The current Code of Governance for Charities states that the positions of Treasurer and Audit/Finance Committee Chairmen on the Board of Directors should preferably possess recognised accounting qualifications and appropriate practical experience.&nbsp; As a Best Practice Guideline, the Code of Governance is not for legal compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charities are encouraged to adopt the guidelines.&nbsp; As such, not all charities may adopt this guideline.&nbsp; Such guidelines are probably even more crucial for large charities.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, the Charities Act or the Code of Governance could be more explicit to ensure that more charities, especially the larger ones, adopt these guidelines.&nbsp;Given their knowledge, experience and skills, accounting and finance professionals can assist the Board to oversee the financial management and internal control systems of the charity unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion is on the financial management in large charities and IPCs.&nbsp;Should there be a requirement under the <p align=left>Column: 1527<p>Charities Act, or a guideline under the Code of Governance, that a Financial Director or Manager has to be a qualified Certified Public Accountant (CPA), or someone with similar recognised academic and professional qualifications, to be employed by large-sized charities? This will ensure that a suitably qualified professional can formulate and implement the necessary financial and accounting policies as well as establish internal control systems for the charity unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large-sized charity unit could also be encouraged to set up an internal audit department to regularly review the policies and internal control systems.&nbsp; Small charities, however,&nbsp;may find this difficult due to&nbsp;their limited resources and maybe some form of assistance could be offered to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newly introduced measures in this Bill, coupled with the current enhanced tax deduction incentives for donations, will contribute towards the Government's vision of developing Singapore&nbsp;as a philanthropy hub.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef and Mr Teo&nbsp;for their support of the Bill and, perhaps even more important, for their very astute observations on the necessity for greater professionalism and greater supervision, and oversight of the charity sector.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have 2,000&nbsp;registered charities in Singapore, and the number is growing.&nbsp; And these 2,000 charities&nbsp;are also a very heterogeneous&nbsp;group&nbsp;&ndash; there are some very&nbsp;large and very capable charities, and also some very small charities.&nbsp;So I am sure that the two Members would appreciate that in our legislative and regulatory framework, we have to take into account this very diverse landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1528<p>Mr Teo suggested making it&nbsp;compulsory for the positions of the Treasurer and, I believe, the Audit and Finance&nbsp;Chairmen on the Board of Directors to preferably possess recognised accounting qualifications and appropriate practical experience.&nbsp; I think this is ideal in an ideal world.&nbsp; He also suggested requiring the larger-sized charities to employ a Financial Director or Manager who is a qualified Certified Public Accountant (CPA), or has&nbsp;similar&nbsp;professional academic qualifications. I agree that these are&nbsp;important considerations and it would indeed be helpful if we had people like these available in order to help&nbsp;exercise appropriate control over the&nbsp;financial matters of charities, particularly the larger ones and those which have been granted IPC (Institution of a Public Character)&nbsp;status, which allows them to issue tax-deductible receipts for&nbsp;donations made to them.&nbsp; The accounts of such charities and IPCs are currently&nbsp;already&nbsp;required by current Statutes to be audited externally by a public accountant.&nbsp;In addition, the IPCs are also required to post their financial statements online.&nbsp;And this provides some level of assurance in the financial management and the transparency of the charities and IPCs concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charities will also have to ensure that they have suitably qualified board members, particularly those who are holding&nbsp;key appointments,&nbsp;as Mr Teo has suggested,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Treasurers and&nbsp;Chairmen of Finance and Audit Committees.&nbsp; Whilst the Code of Governance is not mandatory, across the board for everyone, the system is one in which charities and IPCs will have to explain if they are unable to comply with the&nbsp;Code of Governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This creates a situation where certainly the larger charities and those with larger income streams&nbsp;will find it almost impossible to justify why they do not have qualified staff or qualified board members serving in the management of the committees.&nbsp; On the other hand, we <p align=left>Column: 1529<p>also have to make room for smaller charities or start-up charities, for whom access to such highly qualified and, if I may add, sometimes expensive management staff will not be available to them.&nbsp; So for the smaller charities, where smaller amounts of money have been raised and, in a sense, there is a lower level of risks, we will&nbsp;allow them to deviate sometimes from the Code of Governance but to explain and to be transparent about these deviations.&nbsp; So this provides for a more flexible regulatory framework, a more risk-based and more stratified regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately what we are trying to do is to create a situation which there is more self-regulation.&nbsp; And as&nbsp;a regulator, we have to be very mindful not to overload the charities with such onerous demands that the cost of compliance becomes very high.&nbsp; The cost of compliance for a large charity, if you spread out the cost of getting professionals, may be a tiny fraction&nbsp;&ndash; a small percentage of their overall revenues.&nbsp; But in a small charity, this will become a not-insignificant proportion of their expenditures.&nbsp; And I am sure Members of this House and, indeed, members of the public who donate to charities will not want to see a significant proportion of their donations expended on administrative costs.&nbsp; So I need to persuade Members that we cannot have one-size-fits-all, and we need instead to have the flexibility to regulate different size charities with different risk profiles in an appropriate manner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We acknowledge also the fact that even small charities should have access to professional manpower, and that is why we have launched the programme in which the smaller charities can outsource and seek shared services from professionals.&nbsp; In&nbsp;this&nbsp;way,&nbsp;we will ensure first that there are independent outsiders who are managing and auditing and <p align=left>Column: 1530<p>overseeing the accounts.&nbsp; Secondly, by having shared services you reduce the unit cost of having such qualified people.&nbsp; In that way, we are trying to create a win-win situation where you can have greater confidence in the veracity and integrity of the accounts of even a small charity without unnecessarily inflating the cost of compliance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate our commitment to promoting the growth of the charity sector.&nbsp; We will do so by adopting a facilitative and balanced and flexible regulatory framework, which will enhance public confidence without stifling the spirit of volunteerism, charity and philanthropy, which is really the lifeblood of this&nbsp;sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill seeks to amend the Civil Defence Act&nbsp;(CDA) in three main areas.&nbsp; They are, first, to update the functions of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to include the additional responsibility of handling Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Explosive (CBRE) threats; second, to provide a legal framework for SCDF to extend humanitarian assistance and disaster relief overseas; and third, to update the provisions relating to the discipline and administration of the Force.&nbsp; I will go through each in turn.</p><p><br> <I>Updating of functions</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the CDA was enacted in 1986 to provide for the raising, maintenance and discipline of a civil defence force and for the exercise of the functions and powers of the force during national emergencies.&nbsp; This is the first time the Act is being substantially amended.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1532<p><p><I>Evolving security landscape and SCDF&rsquo;s new CBRE roles</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCDF started off primarily providing fire-fighting, rescue and emergency ambulance services in the 1980s.&nbsp; The security landscape has since evolved significantly.&nbsp; The rapid growth of the petro-chemical industry on Jurong Island and the heightened post-911 security climate has raised new challenges in the form of unconventional CBRE threats and industrial accidents. Hence, from providing fire fighting and emergency ambulance services, SCDF&rsquo;s responsibilities have expanded to include managing emergency disasters such as industrial accidents, CBRE threats as well as preparing the population for such emergencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SCDF has been appointed the Incident Manager to mitigate the consequences of a CBRE incident. To better perform this role, since 2004, the SCDF has been beefing up its \"dirty bomb\" response capabilities.&nbsp; SCDF first responders to a dirty bomb incident have been equipped with radiation detectors to check for and identify on-site radiation contamination.&nbsp; Besides conducting rescue and evacuation, the SCDF Special Rescue Battalion is also equipped to perform radiological decontamination of victims.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address SCDF&rsquo;s enlarged role, clause 2(a) amends section 2 to expand the definition of \"civil defence emergency\" to include a \"hazardous materials\" incident.&nbsp; A definition of hazardous materials is also included and the Minister may add to the hazardous materials list any dangerous article or substance he considers necessary by <I>Gazette.</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Deletion of obsolete force functions</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, even as SCDF&rsquo;s core responsibilities have grown, there are functions previously undertaken by SCDF in a National Emergency scenario that SCDF <p align=left>Column: 1533<p>no longer undertakes.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These functions include assisting public authorities such as the Building Control Authority, Public Utilities Board, Land&nbsp;Transport Authority and MCYS in the clearance of streets, roads and other public places; the disposal of dangerous structures and materials; the repair of essential utilities and Government buildings and the control of writing and distribution of freshwater and other essential supplies.&nbsp; We intend therefore to delete these functions from section 4 of the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Legal framework for overseas deployment</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now deal with the provisions for overseas deployment of SCDF.&nbsp; Clause 22 introduces a new Part XIIIA on \"Service Outside Singapore\" under section 105A to 105D of the Act to facilitate the sending of SCDF officers overseas in response to Civil Defence emergency when such request is made by UN agency or by government or a territory outside Singapore.&nbsp; This can also be in connection with any agreement or arrangement with another country.&nbsp; This amendment is timely, Sir,&nbsp;as SCDF has increasingly been involved in extending humanitarian assistance and disaster relief&nbsp;overseas in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is new about these provisions is that&nbsp;they will specify that SCDF officers deployed overseas remain subject to the Civil Defence Act.&nbsp; So, for instance, an offence allegedly committed by a Force member during overseas service would be treated as if it was committed locally,&nbsp;even if it&nbsp;does not constitute an offence under the laws of the territory where the offence took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are adapted from the Police Force Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since its Operation Lionheart contingent was formed in 1990, SCDF has responded to 11 overseas missions.&nbsp; Indeed, in January 2008, SCDF was <p align=left>Column: 1534<p>internationally recognised for its operational capability in complex search and rescue operations and it became the first in Asia and the&nbsp;seventh in the world to be endorsed as&nbsp;a Heavy Urban Search and Rescue team by the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group&nbsp;(INSARAG).&nbsp; We also&nbsp;ratified the ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response (AADMER) in December 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Discipline and administration of the Force</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, lastly, let me now turn to the final cluster of amendments relating to matters of discipline and administration.&nbsp; The changes are essentially administrative in nature and will enable the SCDF to better manage its members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Timebar for disciplinary actions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, clause 9 amends&nbsp;section 19 to lengthen the time-bar for trial&nbsp;of Full-Time National Serviceman (NSFs), Operationally Ready National Serviceman (ORNSmen) and SCDF auxiliary members by a disciplinary officer for a service&nbsp;offence, except for desertion and absence without leave, from the current six months to&nbsp;three years.&nbsp; This will allow SCDF to deal&nbsp;more effectively with service offences, which&nbsp;are discovered after six months. &nbsp;This amendment will align SCDF's&nbsp;practice to that of the SAF's.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Absence without leave</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, to also align with the SAF Act, clause 12 amends section 48 to provide that a person charged for being Absent Without Leave&nbsp;can raise in defence,&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;his absence was a result of circumstances over which he had no control.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Fines and compensation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;general allowances of&nbsp;our National Servicemen have increased, clause 14 amends&nbsp;section 75 to increase the <p align=left>Column: 1535<p>maximum fine&nbsp;quanta&nbsp;for servicemen from $100 to $300 and for officers from $300 to $1,000.&nbsp; In addition, the maximum compensation liable by an errant Force member to another member who has suffered bodily injury, damage or any loss will be similarly increased from $100 to $300.&nbsp; Further, the detention period in default of fines has been increased to 30 days from 20 days,&nbsp;if the fine exceeds $100 but not more than $300 under clause 17.&nbsp; These amounts are derived from similar provisions under the SAF Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 15 amends section 81(1) to allow civilian officers in the legal profession to be appointed as&nbsp;the reviewing authority for disciplinary cases.&nbsp; This will allow a public legal officer who is not an officer of the Force to serve as&nbsp;a reviewing authority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Service offences</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also proposes a few amendments to service offences.&nbsp; For example, the irrecoverable loss of service property would be classified as a service offence.&nbsp; Examples of such service property would include equipment such as walkie-talkies or laptops, issued to officers as part of the daily duties.&nbsp; In addition, falsification of service documents will be expanded to include documents in the form of electronic records.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>New ranks, appointment and definition of members</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also created the new ranks of \"Senior Assistant Commissioner\" and \"Senior Warrant Officer\" for senior officers and servicemen respectively.&nbsp; In addition,&nbsp;a \"Provost Officer\" now must be specifically appointed by the Commissioner as there may be other officers serving in SCDF's provost unit in&nbsp;administrative positions.&nbsp; In addition, the definition of \"members\" under the Act will be expanded to include auxiliary members,&nbsp;in <p align=left>Column: 1536<p>addition to serving officers and&nbsp;servicemen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Issuance of identity cards</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the issuance of identity cards will also be restricted only to Full-Time National Servicemen, as regular officers already have public service and warrant cards to identify themselves during operations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary, Sir, let me say that SCDF is committed to staying ahead of new security threats,&nbsp;building new capabilities in emergency and disaster response and training and upgrading its members so that Singapore remains&nbsp;safe and secure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

A very good example would be the Exercise North Star, with counter-terrorism measures incorporated.&nbsp; SCDF has always been a major player and will continue to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;coming together under crisis situations allows members to understand coordination as well as field and ground issues well.&nbsp; Will there be more such multi-agency, multi-disciplinary exercises planned?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the deployment of SCDF officers overseas, Sir, I have had the opportunity and privilege of working side by side with many of them in many different settings and countries around the world and I have to say that I am impressed by the level of professionalism, attitude and teamwork as well as camaraderie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pertaining to the amendment to section 4(k), ie, to provide and maintain&nbsp;an adaptive emergency ambulance service, can I ask the Minister the following questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there future plans to expand the SCDF fleet of ambulances? Secondly, will the&nbsp;Advanced Specialist Paramedic Training Course, which has been stopped temporarily, be continued in the near future?&nbsp; This is indeed an important component in the training and specialisation of our paramedics and is&nbsp;a step in the right direction, especially in a climate of increasing expectations of their performance on the ground.&nbsp; It is also something that provides a career path and a vision to aspire to for the passionate paramedic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that Sir, I support the Civil Defence (Amendment) Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir,&nbsp; I thank&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef for speaking in support of the Bill.&nbsp; She <p align=left>Column: 1538<p>asked if there would be more exercises in future, in the same&nbsp;vein, as Exercise NorthStar.&nbsp; Sir, the answer is \"yes\",&nbsp;as these exercises, as she has said, have proven very useful.&nbsp; SCDF&nbsp;started Exercise NorthStar in 1997 to validate the contingency plans of participating agencies and to ensure sound integrated response amongst all these agencies in the event of&nbsp;a civil emergency.&nbsp; To date, we have conducted&nbsp;seven&nbsp;Exercise NorthStars, each with a different focus but with the same purpose&nbsp;of validating operational readiness and preparedness on the part of key agencies.&nbsp; Indeed, SCDF is now preparing for Exercise NorthStar VIII, which is&nbsp;to be conducted&nbsp;next year.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef also asked if there are plans to expand SCDF's&nbsp;fleet of emergency ambulances.&nbsp; Sir, the SCDF currently has a fleet of 40 emergency ambulances of which 36 are operational during the day and 30 at night after 9 pm.&nbsp; In June last year, SCDF engaged two private service providers to supplement its current fleet of emergency ambulances with an additional five ambulances per operator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These private ambulances are stationed at SCDF's&nbsp;fire stations during peak periods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, together, all these ambulances handled about 116,000 emergency cases last year, up from 105,000 in 2007.&nbsp; On average, about 70% of these are medical cases and 30% are&nbsp;trauma cases.&nbsp; Handling about 10% of the cases, the assessment of the private emergency ambulances is that they have done well.&nbsp; Indeed, this has enabled the SCDF to concentrate on its core functions, such as fire-fighting and rescue as well as strengthening its emergency preparedness and counter-terrorism roles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, I thank Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef&nbsp; for her endorsement of how SCDF officers rose to the challenge in meeting the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks.&nbsp; She is absolutely correct when<p align=left>Column: 1539<p> she says that preparedness and knowledge of personal protection can never be underestimated.&nbsp; And these principles underscore the amendments to enable the SCDF to discharge its Chemical, Biological Radiological and Explosive (CBRE) responsibilities.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the performance of the private emergency ambulances in conjunction with the overall need to expand emergency ambulance services in Singapore&nbsp;in light&nbsp;of Singapore's ageing population before deciding whether to add to their fleet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef also asked about the Advanced Paramedics Specialist Training Course (APSC).&nbsp; Sir, the APSC was introduced in 2006.&nbsp; They equip paramedics with advanced life-support skills and knowledge.&nbsp; It has modules&nbsp;on advanced medical and trauma protocols, such as advanced airway management and interpreting electro-cardiogram rhythms.&nbsp; SCDF is currently&nbsp;conducting a&nbsp;review of the effectiveness and relevance of the APSC for&nbsp;its paramedics in their daily work and I will take on board&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Fatimah's feedback because I believe that she was one of the course instructors.&nbsp; I understand that the review is scheduled to be completed in the next&nbsp;work year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the review, SCDF has decided to temporarily stop conducting the course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, I would assure&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef that SCDF's paramedics continue to be rigorously trained and further equipped to handle all medical and trauma emergencies encountered in their daily work through the current Paramedics Specialist Course.&nbsp; In addition, SCDF conducts regular audits and assessments to ensure that both SCDF and the private operators paramedics are&nbsp;<I>au fait</I> with operating procedures and protocols&nbsp;in handling such emergencies.&nbsp; SCDF has given me the assurance that it would not hesitate to mandate additional training or even <p align=left>Column: 1540<p>remove any paramedic who has been found wanting from his duties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash; [Assoc.

I will highlight the key amendments.</p><p><br><I>Foreign developers &ndash; Introduction of a new extension charge framework</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first group of key amendments relates to foreign developers who are given approval under the RPA to acquire or retain land for residential development.&nbsp;They are required to complete their residential development within a stipulated Project Completion Period, which is currently&nbsp;five years.&nbsp;They are then required to sell off all units in the residential development within&nbsp;two years from the issue of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP).&nbsp;This is to prevent them from hoarding or speculating in residential land. If they fail to meet the stipulated timelines, we may forfeit their Banker&rsquo;s Guarantee, which is pegged at 10% of the land price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the amendments, the Controller of residential property will be empowered to levy an extension charge for any extension of time beyond the project completion period.&nbsp;The extension charge framework is essentially the same as the extension premium scheme that applies to the sale of sites under the Government Land Sales programme today.&nbsp;The key advantage of the extension charge framework is to make the cost of delay apparent to the developers and encourage them to complete the developments in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will apply the same penalty regime and extension charge framework to Singapore entities which are given approval to convert to foreign entities and to retain their residential land for development and sale as well as to <p align=left>Column: 1542<p>foreign entities that have been granted approval to change the use of their land to residential use on the basis that they will develop the land and sell the units.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Purchase of individual restricted properties for owner occupation&nbsp;&ndash; Fine-tuning the penalty provisions</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second group of amendments relates to&nbsp;the penalties for offences relating to foreign ownership of individual restricted properties will be enhanced.&nbsp;Today, permanent residents can apply to purchase restricted properties. To prevent speculation in such properties, approved purchasers are allowed to purchase only one property, which cannot be sold within the initial period, currently&nbsp;three years. Approved purchasers are also required to use the property for their own occupation and are not allowed to rent the property out. Owners who breach these conditions are subject to criminal penalties under the RPA, which have not been updated since 1973.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These penalties will be revised to ensure that they continue to be an effective deterrent. Foreign owners who illegally dispose of their property during the non-disposal period are currently liable, upon conviction, to a maximum fine of $5,000.&nbsp;This is far below the amount of profit they might have gained from speculating in the property. We will raise the fine to a maximum of $200,000.&nbsp;As an additional safeguard, the Controller of residential property will be empowered to lodge a caveat on restricted properties purchased pursuant to an approval granted under the RPA. The approval to purchase is granted to selected foreigners on condition that there is no early disposal of the property and a caveat will prevent such unauthorised disposal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other offences where sanctions have to be made commensurate with the severity of the offence. For example, if&nbsp;foreign owner who rents out <p align=left>Column: 1543<p>his residential property without approval will now face a financial penalty of up to&nbsp;three times the rental income earned over the period of breach, or $10,000, whichever is higher.&nbsp;We will remove the current criminal sanction, as that may not be appropriate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, the revised penalties will allow us to take a more calibrated and effective approach in the enforcement of the RPA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Requiring ex-Singapore citizens and ex-Permanent Residents to dispose of their restricted properties</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final group of key amendments deals with the disposal of restricted properties belonging to ex-Singapore citizens and ex-Permanent Residents (PRs), and to foreign persons beneficially entitled to restricted properties through inheritance.&nbsp;Our policy is that only foreigners who are PRs and who have been given specific approval under the RPA can own restricted properties. Foreign beneficiaries who inherit such properties and Singapore citizens and PRs who renounce or lose their citizenship or permanent residency, must dispose of their interests in the properties in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the executors or administrators have&nbsp;10 years to dispose of the foreign beneficiaries&rsquo; interest in a restricted property if the beneficiaries do not qualify for approval under the RPA.&nbsp;As the estate administration process has been simplified with the abolishment of estate duty in 2008, we will shorten the disposal period to five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now also require individuals who renounce or lose their Singapore ctizenship or permanent residency to dispose of their restricted properties. The amendment will address the current anomaly in our laws whereby an ex-Singaporean or ex-PR can continue to hold on to their restricted properties.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1544<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.50 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus on three issues in the Residential Property (Amendment) Bill.&nbsp;<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;individuals who give up their Singaporean citizenship or PR status,&nbsp;Sir, I understand that it is fair that&nbsp;ex-Singaporeans&nbsp;should be treated just like foreigners and they&nbsp;will no longer be entitled to property ownership&nbsp;in a land-scarce country like Singapore. This is in line with the Government&rsquo;s intention to continually emphasise that the status of a Singaporean citizenship is a matter of honour and pride and comes with many privileges. We must constantly show that Singaporeans come first, especially on matters pertaining to&nbsp;property and housing.&nbsp;I would like to raise some suggestions for consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, in recent years, more and more Singaporeans are venturing to live and work abroad in major cities in the world, such as Shanghai and London. Many local firms also have partnerships and overseas offices in these major cities. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, during his US trip in April 2010, called upon overseas Singaporeans to return to help in the country&rsquo;s next phase of development. Just as Singapore seeks out foreign talents to take root in Singapore, overseas Singaporeans are also being courted by these overseas&rsquo; local authorities to sink their roots in these countries. The proposed measure will force Singaporeans, especially those on the brink of giving up their citizenship to rethink their decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interim two years, what other softer approach are we considering to convince them to stay? Would the <p align=left>Column: 1545<p>Government be prepared to carry out an exit interview to find out the reasons why Singaporeans are leaving the country and take the opportunity clarify these people&rsquo;s misgivings. Managing the&nbsp;exit of Singaporeans is no different from managing attrition in a company. We need to take stock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on inheritance, the reduction from 10 years to&nbsp;five years serves as a stern deterrence. The question is: how do we leverage this stern measure to woo ex-Singaporeans to return? The very fact that they are named as beneficiaries signals the desire of their benefactors to keep the ties with them with Singapore. Would the Ministry consider the five-year period as a general rule, but grant flexibility on a case-by-case basis when there is strong evidence that we can win over the ex-Singaporeans to return?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the other significant change is the tightening of rules for foreign property developers. Currently, the RPA mandates that foreign housing developers must complete residential developments within&nbsp;five years. They must also sell all units within&nbsp;two years from the time the project receives its Temporary Occupation Permit. With this Bill, the Ministry of Law is now proposing that developers who fail to complete and sell their developments within the stipulated period will be subject to a new extension charge framework where they will pay for the extension of time beyond the original completion framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to commend the Ministry for introducing such a measure as this will deter foreign property developers from hoarding some units for speculation. Singapore&rsquo;s property market underwent several speculative bubbles and the Government&rsquo;s latest cooling measures are meant to prevent overheating in the property market.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1546<p> Sir, I would like to seek a clarification at this point. Will this new measure also apply to local property developers? If the intention of this new measure is to address the issue of speculative bubbles in the property market, this new measure should equally apply to both foreign&nbsp;and local property developers because the latter is also capable of playing the property market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair --><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>4.54 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Hri Kumar Nair :</B> I rise in support of the Bill.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Property is a sensitive, sometimes emotional, subject among Singaporeans, primarily because of how much it costs, how it can create enormous wealth and how ownership is tied to social mobility and personal success.&nbsp;This has been brought into sharp focus by the current buoyant market, where billionaires are made in months, simply by flipping properties.&nbsp;Some say it makes a mockery of hard work but there it is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land in Singapore is also scarce resource and, therefore, a prime target for speculation and investment both by Singaporeans and foreigners. The RPA has, therefore, served an important role in imposing restrictions against foreigners and permanent residents from owning land and other property in Singapore.&nbsp; They will have to demonstrate that they have or will contribute substantially to our country before they can enjoy some of the privileges Singaporeans have.&nbsp;I say \"some\" because even if they receive approval to buy a restricted property, that approval comes with conditions on selling or against renting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill seeks to enhance those restrictions and ensure that any privileges <p align=left>Column: 1547<p>given are less likely to be abused. In that regard, I support it. I do have a few points of clarification for the Minister which I shall come to later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would first&nbsp;like to start by asking whether we are doing enough to protect ourselves from foreigners who seek to profit at our expense. The RPA protects essentially landed properties, while the HDB Act protects public flats. Everything in between is fair game. But we should be equally concerned with that segment of the market as that will define social mobility for a good proportion of the middle class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not advocating the same protection for this segment.&nbsp;We should not interfere too much in the private market.&nbsp;But there is merit in discouraging speculation in this segment of the property market by foreigners.&nbsp;As I have said previously in this House, I have no issues with genuine investors or home owners.&nbsp;They are important to the growth of the market.&nbsp;It is the \"flippers\" that concern me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the majority of private property purchasers are by Singaporeans and PRs, and \"flippers\"&nbsp;may represent a small class.&nbsp;But that is not the point. Property prices can be driven by&nbsp;sentiment and the activities of a few at the fringes can have an impact.&nbsp;Even if foreigners do not significantly affect prices, how do we benefit from foreigners who flip properties for their own gain?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, ask the Government to consider imposing some form of a tax, like&nbsp;the capital gains tax, on foreigners who sell their properties within a short time after purchase.&nbsp;We also need to address option flipping.&nbsp;Buying and selling options is a pure speculative activity.&nbsp;It adds absolutely no value, other than to artificially drive up prices. I, therefore, suggest that we make options purchased <p align=left>Column: 1548<p>by foreigners non-transferable, or impose a tax on profits gained on the sale of options.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have indicated, the measures should not be targeted at genuine investors or home owners; so those who buy with those intentions should not&nbsp;have&nbsp;any concern.&nbsp;But there should be no sympathy for foreigners who protest that they cannot make a quick profit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Bill, I support the enactment of the new section 3(a), which obliges those who have lost or given up their citizenship or permanent residency to dispose of their restricted property in Singapore.&nbsp;There is no reason why they should not be treated like any other foreign person and it is good that this loop hole is closed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have, however,&nbsp;two issues for the Minister to clarify. First, where an owner of restricted property passes away, bequeathing it to a non-citizen, the Bill requires the legal personal representative to dispose of the property within&nbsp;five years from the death of the deceased person.&nbsp;This is shortened from the current 10 years. Nonetheless, I believe&nbsp;five years is still a tad too generous.&nbsp;He should sell expeditiously.&nbsp;Our probate procedures have been greatly simplified.&nbsp;There is also no longer any estate duty to pay.&nbsp;If he requires more time on account of any complications here or in any foreign probate proceedings, he can apply to the Controller giving good reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Bill introduces a new section 4(a), which allows the Court to make a confiscation order where a defendant is convicted of an offence under section 4(6).&nbsp;Now, section 4(6) offence is one where a foreign person has improperly acquired an interest in a development and fails to comply with a Controller&rsquo;s notice to sell it off.&nbsp;However, a notice to sell can only be issued after the person is convicted under section <p align=left>Column: 1549<p>4(3).&nbsp; That deals with the offence of improperly acquiring the interest in the first place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the circumstances, the confiscation order will not apply to a person who has improperly acquired an interest, but complies with a notice to sell.&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether such a person would be entitled to keep any profit he makes, or any other benefit he receives, although he has violated the RPA.&nbsp;If so, what is the rationale for this and should the confiscation provisions not apply generally to give the Courts the power to seize any benefits enjoyed on account of any breach&nbsp;of the RPA? The offender could benefit significantly as there may be a lengthy period between the time he improperly acquires the interest and when the notice to sell lapses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Mr Deputy Speaker, on this Bill specifically, I have two queries.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, can <p align=left>Column: 1550<p>the Minister comment on the expected effects of this Bill on the property market?&nbsp;&nbsp; To help us better understand the potential implications of this Bill on property prices, may I ask the Minister for some details of ownership patterns:&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the proportion of restricted residential property that is owned by foreigners?&nbsp;&nbsp; What proportion of these is owner-occupied?&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is the average length of ownership &ndash; that is, are foreign owners likely to hold on to purchases for an extended period of time as long-term investments or are they are more likely to be flippers?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, if one intent of this Bill is to stabilise property prices, will the Minister consider extending regulation of foreign ownership to other private properties like condominiums and high-rise private apartments?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary aim of residential property should be&nbsp;to promote home ownership.&nbsp; We believe that an increase in homeownership among citizens will contribute to the growth of engaged stakeholders.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While HDB has been very successful in growing the proportion of homeowners among Singaporeans, we also note that as our society matures, more Singaporeans aspire to own private properties.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given that private properties &ndash; both landed and high-rise &ndash; are valued commodities in land-scarce Singapore, will the Minister consider restricting foreign ownership of condominiums and high-rise apartments, especially those purchased purely for investment and not residential needs?&nbsp;&nbsp; This may place the coveted ownership of private property within the reach of many more Singaporeans.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Shanmugam:</B> Sir, I thank the Members for their support of the Bill and for speaking up.&nbsp; The points&nbsp;range from <p align=left>Column: 1551<p>persuading Singaporeans not to give up their citizenship to flippers of condominiums to whether the aims of this Bill are to prevent the overheating of the market and to what we can do about condominiums and foreign ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act deals with restricted properties which by definition are landed properties.&nbsp; The aims of the Bill are very narrow and most of these topics are neither within the purview of my Ministry nor within this Bill, but I will try and deal with some of them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo&nbsp;asked if the Government would be prepared to engage Singaporeans on the brink of giving up their citizenship to persuade them not to do so.&nbsp; As I said, this question raises questions which are well outside the ambit and purposes of this Bill but, I think, as the Home Affairs Minister, I can say this to her that when a Singaporean seeks to renounce his or her citizenship either at ICA or at our overseas missions, the Government will engage the citizen and try and find out that person's reason for wanting to do so.&nbsp; We also take the opportunity to advise the citizen to take some time to reconsider their decision.&nbsp; But, at the end of the day, we have to recognise that a person's decision to renounce his or her citizenship&nbsp;is usually not taken lightly and the Government will respect that decision however much we would like the person to remain our citizen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back to the Bill, what we are doing is to establish clear principles on when the right to hold a restricted property ceases amongst others for individuals who lose or give up their Singapore citizenship. The amendments were not designed as measures to discourage Singaporeans from giving up their citizenship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member has also asked if we can exercise flexibility in applying the compulsory disposal rule for foreign <p align=left>Column: 1552<p>beneficiaries of inherited properties and for ex-Singapore citizens.&nbsp; If the MP is asking whether we can selectively waive the disposal requirement for these two groups of foreigners, the short answer is no.&nbsp; There is no reason for us to treat them specially and differently from other foreigners.&nbsp; If, however, they meet the criteria to be granted approval to own restricted properties in their own right, they will be allowed to keep the properties.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar commented that the five-year timeframe for foreign beneficiaries to dispose of their interests in restricted property is too&nbsp;generous.&nbsp; Our view is that a reduction from 10 years to&nbsp;five years is reasonable given that&nbsp;Court procedures may be involved.&nbsp; Having said that, we will monitor the situation to see if further adjustments to the timeframe are needed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho has asked if the extension charge framework will be extended to local property developers.&nbsp; The restricted property extension framework is only imposed on foreign developers who are granted approval to acquire private land to develop residential units for sale.&nbsp; This framework is aligned with the extension premium scheme already in place under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme.&nbsp; The GLS extension premium scheme is imposed on all developers, both local and foreign who develop State land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar has asked if we should not give the Courts the power to seize the benefits enjoyed by a foreign person who has, without approval, acquired all the units in the development, thereby acquiring an interest in the restricted property.&nbsp; It may be difficult for the Courts to quantify the benefits that a foreign person has enjoyed when he does this. Hence, this has not been provided for in the Bill but we will certainly consider the Member's suggestion as we go forward to see whether&nbsp;it can be refined further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1553<p> When the foreign person subsequently fails to comply with the notice to divest, we have empowered the courts to seize the units which the Controller has specified to be divested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assoc. Prof. Straughan has asked about the impact of the Bill on the property market and I think Mdm Ho complimented us&nbsp;on trying to make sure that the property market does not get overheated.&nbsp; I do not think I will accept that particular compliment.&nbsp; As I said, this Bill does not have such grand aims.&nbsp; We have to understand the Bill does not change&nbsp;the conditions under which foreigners can buy restricted properties.&nbsp; It simply enhances the penalty provisions of the Restricted Property Act (RPA) so that the penalties remain enough of&nbsp;a deterrent&nbsp;against potential abusers of the RPA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, restricted properties comprising mainly landed residential properties form only 6% of the total housing stock in Singapore and only 3.6% of that 6% of the restricted properties are owned by foreigners.&nbsp; We have been very strict.&nbsp; So, only 6% of the properties&nbsp;can be termed landed residential properties.&nbsp; And if you take that figure of 6%, foreign ownership does not exceed 3.6%;&nbsp;so it is&nbsp;very small.&nbsp; As such, it would be surprising if the amendments to the RPA should&nbsp;have a significant impact on the property market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc.&nbsp;Prof. Straughan also has asked about the length of ownership of restricted properties.&nbsp; Under the RPA, foreigners who are given approval to purchase restricted properties can buy only one restricted&nbsp;property and this must be for owner-occupation.&nbsp; Further, they are not allowed to sell the property within the first three years to deter purchase for speculative purposes.&nbsp; After the three years, the approved purchasers can continue to hold on to their property for <p align=left>Column: 1554<p>as long as they need it for their ownership and occupation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Hri Kumar is suggesting that the Government consider measures such as capital gains tax and a tax on sale of options to curb speculative activity by foreigners in non-landed private properties.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Straughan has raised a related suggestion that is similar to the RPA, ie, we restrict foreign ownership of non-landed private property such as condominiums and other high-rise apartments in order to stabilise property prices.&nbsp; I have said the aim of the RPA is to ensure ownership of landed properties by foreigners is carefully controlled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issues relating to private property prices, speculation and properties are well outside the purview of this Bill.&nbsp; They are really best addressed to the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF).&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, controlling the purchase of non-landed properties by foreigners is also outside the purview of this Bill.&nbsp; Members may, however, know that several Ministers had previously pointed out that it is quite a bad idea to try and restrict foreigners from owning non-landed properties in Singapore. There are many possible consequences and most of them are bad for Singapore.&nbsp; If demand drops signficantly, all existing homeowners, many of them Singaporeans, will suffer serious asset devaluation.&nbsp; And our position as an international, vibrant, attractive city as a magnet for capital and talent will also suffer.&nbsp; That will have negative consequences for the economy.&nbsp; We should be mindful, therefore, that if you make a move like preventing foreign ownership of condominiums, we will have to deal with such trade-offs.&nbsp; Are we prepared for those trade-offs?&nbsp; Indeed, any debate on this topic must also take into account what will happen if such controls are imposed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, coming back to restricted properties, the Government has <p align=left>Column: 1555<p>been very careful about non-Singaporeans owning landed properties in Singapore and the conditions under which they can own such properties.&nbsp; That is why the figure today of foreign ownership of landed properties in Singapore is less than 4%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reassure Members that we will continue to keep that approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.&nbsp;&ndash;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this Bill will enable my Ministry to establish the new employment dispute resolution mechanism for PMEs.&nbsp; That mechanism comprises two components, namely adjudication and tripartite mediation. &nbsp; We will allow&nbsp;PMEs to have their salary claims adjudicated at the Labour Court.&nbsp; However, to facilitate early and amicable resolution of employment disputes, a new tripartite mediation process will also be introduced to help PMEs resolve common employment disputes including salary claims.&nbsp; This will help to minimise the need to resort to adjudicate or civil litigation actions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Tripartite mediation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will first explain the amendments relating to the introduction of the tripartite mediation process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mediation provides greater flexibility for the settlement of employment disputes.&nbsp; Over the years, we have built up an effective system of resolving employment disputes in the unionised sector under our existing tripartite framework.&nbsp; Disputes have been amicably resolved with positive outcomes and paved the way for closer labour management relations in workplaces.&nbsp; The tripartite mediation process is a new concept.&nbsp; It leverages on the expertise and experience of our tripartite partners to help&nbsp;employers and employees resolve employment disputes and foster workplace harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1557<p> Currently, PMEs in the unionised sector can seek conciliation to resolve their employment disputes if they are eligible for full or limited representation through their trade unions.&nbsp; A new Part IVA in the Industrial Relations Act will be introduced to provide an avenue for PMEs in the non-unionised sector to seek remedy for their disputes through the new tripartite mediation process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Eligibility</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 30F of the new Part IVA spells out the eligibility criteria for tripartite mediation.&nbsp; As a first step, we will allow PMEs, who earn up to $4,500 a month and have joined any registered trade union as individual members without any form of representation rights, to have access to tripartite&nbsp;mediation.&nbsp; The salary cap of $4,500 will potentially cover about half or about 500,000 of the Professionals, Managers, Executives (PMEs) in the workforce.&nbsp; This includes both those PMEs who are already individual union members and those who may join trade unions as individual&nbsp;members in future.&nbsp; Union membership is&nbsp;integral to the design of the tripartite mediation process which leverages on the expertise of tripartite partners in resolving industrial and employment related disputes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For PMEs who are not union members, my Ministry will continue to offer advice and assistance as well as voluntary mediation services through the existing Executive Mediation Unit if disputing parties consent to participate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Scope</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scope of tripartite mediation, as specified in section 30G, will cover disputes arising from salary arrears, breach of individual employment contracts and payment of retrenchment benefits <p align=left>Column: 1558<p>which are the most common issues faced by PMEs.&nbsp; We should encourage employees to surface their disputes as early as possible when the facts of the case are still clear so as to have higher chances of successful mediation.&nbsp; Therefore, the dispute must be lodged within a year from occurrence of the material fact that gives rise to the dispute.&nbsp; For disputes arising out of termination of contract of employment, the case must be lodged within six months from the date of termination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address employers' concerns of potential conflict of interests, section 30G provides employers with the right to object to the eligibility of certain categories of employees such as those in senior management positions, those involved in hiring, firing, promotions, dismissals and disciplinary duties, those with access to confidential information such as payroll and budgeting information, those who represent employers' interests in union-management matters and those whose access to tripartite mediation may give rise to a conflict of interest.&nbsp; This is similar to the provision for employers' objections under limited representation in Part&nbsp;IV of the Industrial Relations Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commissioner of Labour will consider the employer's objection and decide whether it will stand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Procedure</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under section 30H, PMEs who wish to make use of the tripartite mediation mechanism should lodge the case with the Ministry of Manpower through the registered trade union of which he is an individual member or any federation that his union may be affiliated to.&nbsp; The Commissioner will then arrange for a tripartite mediation session to be conducted by a conciliation officer.&nbsp; The Commissioner would also assign tripartite mediation advisors (TMAs) to assist the employee and his employer respectively in <p align=left>Column: 1559<p>the mediation. The TMAs will be appointed by the Minister for Manpower with nominations from our tripartite partners, namely the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF) or National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).&nbsp; These advisors should have a track record and be experienced in managing and resolving employment disputes, and be knowledgeable in employment practices and norms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conciliation officer may allow other persons to assist the TMAs at the request of the&nbsp;requesting parties.&nbsp; Such persons may include the employee's union officials, or a representative of an employer or a business&nbsp;organisation which the&nbsp;employer is a member of.&nbsp; However, practising lawyers will not be allowed to participate in the mediation process in line with the current provisions for conciliation in the Industrial Relations Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Attendence</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful mediation requires the commitment from both parties to resolve the dispute on mutually agreeable terms.&nbsp; It is important for both employer and employee to attend the tripartite mediation as it provides an opportunity for them to explore options and to arrive at an amicable settlement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill, therefore, provides for measures&nbsp;that can be taken if either party to the dispute fails to attend any mediation process.&nbsp; Non-attendance without reasonable excuse by the employee may result in the tripartite mediation proceedings.&nbsp; An employer who fails to attend repeatedly can be ordered by the Minister to attend tripartite mediation.&nbsp; If he again fails to do so, he may be fined up to $5,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effective mediation will reduce the likelihood of disputes&nbsp;being referred for litigation.&nbsp; It also encourages the adoption of good employment practices to avoid <p align=left>Column: 1560<p>disputes in future.&nbsp; If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, the employee concerned may pursue their claim through the civil courts.&nbsp; If the dispute involves a salary claim, the claim may be adjudicated by my Ministry through the Labour Court following amendments to the Employment Act.&nbsp; Salary being the most fundamental employment right for employees requires a low-cost and an expeditious settlement through adjudication.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Adjudication of salary claims</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, the Employment Act allows junior managers and executives with basic monthly salary of $2,500 and below to have access to the Labour Court for adjudication on salary claims.&nbsp; Clause 6(a) raises this salary ceiling to give Professional, Managers and Executives with basic monthly salary of up to $4,500 access to the Labour Court for salary claims.&nbsp; This is open to PMEs in&nbsp;all companies regardless of whether they are unionised or otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clause 6(b) introduces a cap of $20,000 on the amount which the Commissioner can award for each lodged claim.&nbsp; Imposing a cap encourages employees to surface their salary claims as early as possible before salary arrears accumulate to large amounts.&nbsp; Based on our records, all past disputes involving PMEs were below the $20,000 limit.&nbsp; Those who wish to claim for an amount higher than $20,000 or to pursue non-salary claims can continue to do so through the civil courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Bill also makes a technical amendment to the Employment Act to clarify that the adjudication process in the Labour Court shall not involve any trade unions unless the company involved is already unionised and its employee is a union member with full representation and collective bargaining rights.&nbsp; This is already the current practice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1561<p><p><I>Enhancing penalties under the Industrial Relations Act</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move to the other changes in the Bill.&nbsp; Penalties under the Industrial Relations Act have remained unchanged since 1966.&nbsp; Clause 5 of the Bill seeks to align the IRA penalties with those that commensurate offences in the Employment Act.&nbsp; For other offences, the maximum fines will also be updated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To provide greater flexibility to impose appropriate penalties in lieu of prosecution, section 88 has been inserted to allow the Commissioner to compound any offence with a composition fine not exceeding $1,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this new mechanism involving adjudication and tripartite mediation ensures that our employment laws and practices continue to remain relevant to the changing workforce profile and needs.&nbsp; If the Bill is passed in Parliament, we intend for it to take effect on 1st February 2011. The new mechanism would help the growing population of Professionals, Managers and Executives resolve employment disputes amicably.&nbsp; Effective implementation of this new mechanism will foster workplace harmony for the benefit of all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In formulating the mechanism, we have engaged the tripartite partners to design a system that is workable and fair to all parties.&nbsp; As part of the consultation process, we have also sought feedback from the public.&nbsp; This new mechanism gives our tripartite partners an important instituional role in helping to resolve employment disputes pertaining to Professionals, Managers and Executives.&nbsp; As we move forward, we will work closely with the tripartite partners to ensure smooth implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg to move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1562<p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I>&nbsp; Question proposed.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.26 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of this Bill.&nbsp; The amendments address a current deficit in our law and seek to provide Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs) who have employment disputes with their employers with access to adjudication and tripartite mediation.&nbsp; Extended access to adjudication for PMEs who earn less than $4,500 is a welcome move as this is something already provided for in many countries.&nbsp; For example, in Malaysia, executives have access to the Industrial Court in order to resolve their employment disputes.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our rank-and-file workers already have recourse to adjudication by the Labour Court because of the coverage under the Employment Act.&nbsp; Sir, the difference in this Bill is that it also provides for a tripartite way to resolve employment disputes involving PMEs.&nbsp; I am not aware of any other country which has a similar provision which means we are likely to be the first to introduce it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The establishment of this tripartite mediation mechanism is, in my view, a great testimony to the strength of tripartism in Singapore and the extent to which it has evolved and matured over the years, and the confidence and trust that the tripartite partners have developed in each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we know very well that we need a procedure for the amicable settlement of disputes involving PMEs.&nbsp; With better education and the transit to a knowledge-based economy, the percentage of PMEs&nbsp;in our workforce has increased exponentially.&nbsp; If we insist that their disputes should continue to be settled through litigation in a civil court, as is the current situation, we are not being fair to the PMEs as litigation is costly and takes a long time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1563<p>At the same time, a <I>status quo</I> is also not to the advantage of employers as dissatisfied PMEs cannot be productive workers.&nbsp; With a strong labour market, PMEs could also vote with their feet, resulting in the companies losing good employees in whom they have invested heavily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, unlike mediation, litigation injects a lot of hostility and contention in the workplace.&nbsp; The beauty in the tripartite mediation approach is that it provides a non-adversarial, less conflictual method of resolving disputes as the focus of the mediation is to find a solution acceptable to the two sides, not to mention it is also inexpensive and simple.&nbsp; So even though the tripartite mediation mechanism is introduced through legislation, its approach is still very much conciliatory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Bill also seeks to address other gaps in the current system.&nbsp; Although there is currently an Executive Mediation Unit in the Ministry which provides conciliation service to PMEs with disputes against their employers, the Executive Mediation Unit has no power to compel attendance, a point which is now addressed under clause 30J(2) which provides that mediation is compulsory and that an employer who fails to attend tripartite&nbsp;mediation is guilty of an offence and can be fined up to $5,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me take this opportunity to commend the Ministry for Manpower for introducing this Bill and providing greater protection to our PMEs.&nbsp; Let me also commend the employers in Singapore, too, for their far-sightedness and their constructive approach in supporting this Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some critics may argue that this Bill has not gone far enough.&nbsp; But we need to bear in mind that everything has to have a start and this is as good a start as any.&nbsp; Others may be concerned that this may open a Pandora's box with a deluge of <p align=left>Column: 1564<p>PME disputes suddenly surfacing.&nbsp; My advice to employers is that if they do not want their PMEs to refer to their disputes to adjudication and tripartite mediation, then treat them fairly and, above all, provide for an effective grievance procedure within the company itself which the PMEs can have easy access to.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now come to some specific clauses in the Bill. Clause 30(f) of the Bill limits access to tripartite mediation only to executives earning not more that $4,500&nbsp;a month. While this income ceiling would cover quite a significant number of executives today, I would like to urge the Ministry not to cast this in stone but to regularly review this salary ceiling as incomes will rise and we have to ensure that the scope is wide enough to cover a sufficient number of executives; otherwise over time, we will find that this mechanism becomes less and less useful to executives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 30(i) provides that an employer has the right to object to the eligibility of an executive employee to tripartite mediation on certain grounds listed under paragraphs A to E. Clause 30I is an exclusion clause.&nbsp; In other words, although an executive may be earning less than $4,500 per month, he or she may be excluded if he or she falls within any of those paragraphs, for example, if the person is employed in a senior management position. Although I am aware that each case will have to be decided on its own merits, as this is an exclusion clause, I hope that it will be invoked sparingly as we do want as many executives as possible to be covered under tripartite mediation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other concern that I have is whether some employers can take advantage of clause 30(i) in order to frustrate an executive's claim by deliberately delaying the process, instead of the&nbsp;given 14 days in order to file an objection.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Ministry <p align=left>Column: 1565<p>to monitor the situation closely so that the objective of the Act is not undermined.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, clause 30(k) provides for the appointment of tripartite mediation advisers to assist the conciliation officer in the solving of disputes. The Bill is, however, silent on how this tripartite mediation advisers will be appointed, what would be their qualifications and what would be their roles. I would appreciate if the Ministry could throw more light on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the amendments related to the Employment Act, the Bill raises the salary cap for salary disputes involving PMEs that can be referred to the Labour Court under section 115. Currently, only those earning $2,500 can refer their salary disputes to the Labour Court, but under the Bill, PMEs earning up to $4,500 can do so. This is certainly an improvement and I welcome it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the Bill has also introduced a&nbsp;limit on the salary claims that PMEs can make in the Labour Court, which is $20,000, when currently there is no such limit. Could the Minister explain why there is a need to impose this limit and whether this would deter PMEs with bigger claims from making use of adjudication process to settle their disputes? At the same time, I would also like to urge the Minister to review this $20,000 limit regularly to ensure that the provision remains effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, Sir, under the Bill, executives can refer only salary claims to the Labour Court for adjudication if the dispute cannot be resolved through tripartite mediation. Again, whilst this is a good start, over time, I hope that the Minister could consider widening this provision so that other claims could also be referred to the Labour Court, as <p align=left>Column: 1566<p>limiting it only to salary claims is quite narrow although it is still a very useful start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also urge the Ministry to allocate adequate resources and to have sufficiently trained staff so that this new tripartite mediation mechanism can work effectively. As the claims of executives will not be based on the Employment Act, which does not cover them, and with their better education, conciliation officers need to be properly trained to effectively chair the tripartite mediation sessions. The NTUC, on&nbsp;its part, has been gearing up efforts to provide assistance to PMEs once the new law is in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, in my view, the adjudication and tripartite mediation mechanism&nbsp;provided under this Bill is a huge step forward and provides for a constructive way of resolving the grievances involving our executives. This is a win-win formula, possible only because of our strong tripartite relationship. I am confident that it will further enhance labour management relations in Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.34 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Paulin Tay Straughan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill aims to establish a new scheme for the mediation of disputes involving employees engaged in the professional, managerial or executive positions and their employers.&nbsp;There is ample evidence to show the strong correlation between job satisfaction and productivity at the workplace.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stand in support of this Bill, as a proposed dispute resolution mechanism involving adjudication and tripartite mediation will help sustain harmonious workplace relations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I have three short queries for the Minister. First, on the <p align=left>Column: 1567<p>stipulated income ceiling of $4,500 for eligibility of inclusions, may I ask the Minister what is&nbsp;the proportion of disputes filed in the past three years which involve employees earning less than $4,500? This data will help us appreciate the number of cases which this Bill will help offload from civil litigation. I believe it is important to avoid civil litigation whenever possible and over-reliance on litigation to resolve disputes will inevitably drive up legal costs. More importantly, a case that heads towards the Courts for formal adjudication will inevitably result in irreconcilable relations, especially where the nature of disputes&nbsp;is likely to be resolved by mediation. The amendments proposed in this Bill will be mutually beneficial to both employees and employers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second query focuses on the constitution of the Mediation Panel. For mediation to work, the expertise of the panel is critical. May I ask the Minister for details on how members of the Mediation Panel will be chosen, what are the criteria for selection and will panel members be given formal training to equip them with the necessary skills to resolve labour disputes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, will the outcomes of mediation be known to the public?&nbsp; I think it is important that proceedings are kept transparent and, through observation, employers may pick up best practices to avoid potential unhappiness in the workplace. Similarly, employees will also be able&nbsp;to level up on their appreciation of what are the fair practices and fair expectations they may have from their organisations.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.37 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Sir, the planned amendments to the Industrial Relations Act will cover more executives when the salary ceiling for <p align=left>Column: 1568<p>executives covered by the Act is changed from $2,500 to $4,500.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, Sir, the scope of the Industrial Relations Act and the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Manpower have been limited to the protection of junior or mid-level employees based on salary ceiling criteria. The current relatively low salary threshold meant that many junior or mid-level PMEs do not have easy access to an avenue of redress in relation to employment-related disputes. Sir, therefore, with the current involvement of more PMEs in our workforce and the higher education levels and the increasing salary levels due to the economic growth that we have experienced, the scope of representation allowable in the current Industrial Relations Act is rather limited. As the median salary for employees moves up, the proposal to raise the salary thresholds allows more junior managers and executives access to the adjudication process for salary claims. This is a very positive development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, Sir, the increased economic volatility and shorter business cycles have led to a sense of employment insecurity. Employers are often challenged to reduce costs of operation. Thus, when cost-cutting measures&nbsp; involve employees, we could potentially see more PMEs facing employment disputes with their employers. The costs for legal representation in the Civil Dispute Court for junior to mid-level PMEs may still prove to be a significant burden. While the civil litigation process is still available to settle their disputes, a speedy and low-cost dispute settlement would certainly benefit both employers and PMEs. This helps to move away from confrontational labour management relations to strive for industrial peace with justice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed change in salary ceiling is expected to benefit over 500,000 professional, managers and executives. I <p align=left>Column: 1569<p>understand&nbsp;that there have been suggestions to raise this ceiling even higher than $4,500. First, I would encourage that MOM continuously&nbsp;monitor the salary trends and the effectiveness of this mechanism to ensure that it serves its purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, currently, the eligible PME union members in unionised companies can seek some form of representation from their trade unions to resolve their individual employment disputes under the Industrial Relations Act. However, PME union members in the non-unionised companies do not have similar avenues. The proposed amendments allow such PMEs access to a new tripartite mediation process to resolve their employment disputes with employers, provided they are members of a registered union without individual rights, subject to a new $4,500 salary ceiling. This new dispute resolution process emphasises on mediation between employees and employers. The mediation will be led by the&nbsp;Ministry of Manpower and supported by SNEF and NTUC.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the introduction of this new dispute resolution process is a change&nbsp;&ndash; a positive change to the employment landscape in Singapore, which is commonly regarded as a relatively easier jurisdiction for employers to navigate. This is an important change for human resource professionals and managers to understand and to adapt to. And this change should be viewed positively. Regardless of the avenues of the redress available, efforts should be taken to prevent a dispute from even arising. &nbsp;Adoption of good corporate practices, development and enforcement of sound company policies and regulations will be instrumental in preventing unnecessary disputes. The introduction of a speedy and low-cost dispute resolution process, in fact, not only empowers the employees <p align=left>Column: 1570<p>but it also confers employers with benefits. While much remains to be seen, an effective dispute resolution process could be helpful in stamping frivolous employment litigation that is intended to harass and pressure an employer to a monetary settlement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, similarly, the implementation of a new dispute resolution process is indicative of a paradigm shift in the employment landscape in Singapore to one which is increasingly protective of our employees. The current state of Singapore's employment law is favourable for businesses and companies. However, this should not be taken for granted. The development of an employer-employee relationship based on trust and confidence should not be neglected. It forms the basis upon which employees develop loyalty to their employers and the motivation to work in the best interests of the business. Even more so, where employees may now have a better bargaining position, employers should always be mindful to treat employees with due respect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my experience as the Executive Secretary of the Education Services Union shows that more PMEs are keen to join and want the union to represent them in one way or another. Singapore's unique and strong tripartism is a strength that must continue to be leveraged for the good of our country. This tripartism has moved the nation over the years towards a more conducive industrial relations climate, thus, coincided with our economic growth. The strong tripartite partnership has been a key competitive advantage for Singapore. It underpins its economic competitiveness, its harmonious labour management relations and the overall progress of a nation as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure my esteemed colleagues from MOM and SNEF will agree that we should all pursue a partnership and problem-solving approach in addressing, <p align=left>Column: 1571<p>formulating, finding solutions to and implementing employment and industrial relations issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.44 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Heng Chee How):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to join the debate. I wish to speak on two points and ask three questions. My two points are about how the structure of the Singapore workforce has changed and how tripartism must keep up with the changes to remain relevant.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when Singapore became independent, we depended on a mixture of trade, agriculture and British military bases to make a living. The education level of the population and the workforce at that time was low and so were the wages. With the withdrawal of the British military at the end of the 1960s and the advent of industrialisation from the early 1970s, Singapore's workforce became more manufacturing-based and a generation of factory workers and technicians emerged. But&nbsp;up till then, the workforce was mainly blue collar. Later on, the services industry expanded and white collar workers grew as a segment of the workforce as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, the Singapore economy has transformed itself even more and has become ever more high value-added as well as knowledge-based. The education of the population has&nbsp;changed in tandem with the needs of the economy and with improving living standards.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, the segment of Professionals, Managers and Executives (PMEs)&nbsp;came about and grew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, the percentage of PMETs, that is, the PMEs plus the technicians, as a group&nbsp;within the workforce, crossed the 50% mark for the first time.&nbsp; This is a significant milestone because it signals <p align=left>Column: 1572<p>that the hopes, aspirations, needs and fears of this&nbsp;group has become important and will grow further.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the areas that the tripartite partners must, therefore, pay close attention to is the resolution of disputes at the workplace to promote fair treatment and fair play in order to&nbsp;ensure industrial peace, not only for the rank and file but for all, including the PMEs for industrial peace is a pre-requisite&nbsp;for the long-term, large and recurring investments and such investments in turn define the prospects for more and better jobs for Singaporeans.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this while, rank-and-file workers in unionised companies who are members of trade unions can take up their grievances and disputes with management via the unions.&nbsp; Executives who are ordinary members of executive unions may do likewise.&nbsp; And for executives who are members of rank-and-file unions, they have, in recent years, been able to have access to union services in respect of&nbsp;four categories of issues: retrenchment and benefits, victimisation, breach of contract as well as the&nbsp;wrongful dismissal. &nbsp;And that is provided for under the Industrial Relations Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who are not union members,&nbsp;or for union members who&nbsp;are PMEs but who work in non-unionised companies,&nbsp;they may approach the Ministry of Manpower&rsquo;s Executive Mediation Unit (EMU) for advice and assistance.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over at the NTUC, we run a General Branch Services Unit which services the workplace-related enquiries and calls for assistance of union members who are our members but who work in non-unionised companies.&nbsp; In the past several years, we have seen a clear trend in&nbsp;the enquiries and calls for assistance from such members.&nbsp; Since the year 2006, as the proportion of all callers to our General Branch Services Unit hotline, <p align=left>Column: 1573<p>15% of those were PMEs in 2006, but by 2009 and also this year, that has gone up to 42%.&nbsp; In terms of the kinds of matters that&nbsp;they seek help on, about 30% relate to termination and retrenchment, 20% about salary arrears and benefits, and 30% are about labour law.&nbsp; Sir, I believe that this increase in the proportion of PME requests for assistance reflects the increasing numbers and proportion of PMEs within&nbsp;our workforce.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tripartism in Singapore is a pragmatic one.&nbsp; It is also a proactive one.&nbsp; It does not wait for a problem to arise or&nbsp;get out of hand before acting.&nbsp; It is a tripartism that is able to be sensitive to developments on the ground, listen very accurately, promptly and see what needs to be done and then act on it quickly.&nbsp; And that is why Singapore's tripartism has been able to tackle successfully&nbsp;the many crises that have hit us over the decades and the numerous crises&nbsp;just these past 10 years, including the big recession that hit us last year, and yet come out stronger.&nbsp; And this is why tripartism in Singapore&nbsp;is not just a vision or&nbsp;a slogan but a reality and a key competitive advantage.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore timely and necessary for the tripartite partners to take into account&nbsp;this fact of a growing PME segment and mobilise its energies and resources to attend to the trend.&nbsp; By doing so, it will further reinforce its value and relevance and strengthen its ability to turn a need into an advantage for the mutual good of employees and businesses.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, therefore, welcome the introduction of this Dispute Resolution arrangement&nbsp;for PMEs. It complements the existing arrangements for the PMEs at MOM, and makes it even more focused and refined for PMEs who are union members.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my&nbsp;three questions are, firstly, why should there be a $4,500 salary limit to who can be included under this <p align=left>Column: 1574<p>arrangement?&nbsp; While employees can understand why those who hold&nbsp;hire and fire powers or who are&nbsp;privy to confidential information about the company or employees may be excluded from the arrangement on grounds of conflict of interest, it is not immediately obvious why there should be a salary limit of $4,500.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, some may wonder if such an arrangement is fair or practical enough and it would be good if the Minister could explain this more.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is: why limit the arrangement&nbsp;to the said categories of issues as listed in the Bill?&nbsp; Because disputes and grievances can arise over any number of issues at any point of time and, for some, this would seem to prejudge what may occur.&nbsp; So, what is the rationale behind limiting the range of issues that this new arrangement can cover, and&nbsp;would the MOM be monitoring the demand patterns &ndash; the kinds of issues that come out &ndash; as we go forward, and then refine these categories as&nbsp;appropriate at some future point?</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, thirdly, why is the attendance mandatory&nbsp;at the mediation&nbsp;session but at&nbsp;the outcome not mandatory?&nbsp; That is, why are we choosing mediation over adjudication? &nbsp;If the purpose of dispute resolution is to resolve the dispute, then one may argue that securing the attendance of the&nbsp;two parties is necessary and critical.&nbsp; We hear many anecdotes where mediation cannot take place simply because&nbsp;of non-attendance of one of the parties.&nbsp; However, having secured the attendance of the parties, then how does one maximise the&nbsp;opportunity to resolve the dispute?&nbsp; Thus, it is important to explain why the recommendations arising out of those sessions&nbsp;are not made binding or in some way&nbsp;made to carry more weight.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that&nbsp;the Minister can elaborate and clarify on the thinking and reasons behind these parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Bill.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><p align=left>Column: 1575<p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.52 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would first like to commend the Ministry for raising the salary limit of employees termed \"executives\" to $4,500.&nbsp; This will allow for a wider range of representation of executives and PMEs applaud that they now&nbsp;have a proper recourse to grievances.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, disputes between PMEs and their employers are settled through civil litigation which can be protracted, painful and a costly process.

However, disputes involving employment discrimination (ie, racial, disability or&nbsp;medical conditions) are not subject to this new scheme. &nbsp;In fact, discrimination-related disputes were raised during the public consultation for this Bill, and the Ministry recommended that PMEs who face discrimination-related grievances should raise the issues to the attention of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP).&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that the establishment of TAFEP is a step in the right direction to help PMEs but unless TAFEP is able to bite harder, shed its baby&nbsp;teeth and grow its permanent teeth quickly,&nbsp;PMEs would still need legislated representation on discrimination-related grievances. &nbsp;Sir, to strengthen TAFEP, we need to engage more employers with TAFEP.&nbsp; I would like to ask whether&nbsp;we have statistics&nbsp;on the growth of TAFEP employer membership to date.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1576<p>Sir, I note that employment discrimination in Singapore is not adequately dealt with. &nbsp;It is also troublesome and confusing even for PMEs to have to turn to different channels to resolve different types of disputes. Should there not be a one-stop shop for all employment disputes as opposed to separating between basic employment breaches and employment discrimination?&nbsp; Sir, often there could be a combination of disputes from both categories occurring concurrently. &nbsp;After all, the purpose of this Bill is for PMEs to gain access to a low-cost settlement mechanism and there is not&nbsp;a substantial reason for distinguishing between basic employment breaches and employment discrimination.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to raise a suggestion concerning the issue of speeding up the settlement process.&nbsp; I understand that if tripartite mediation fails to reach an amicable settlement, the respective claims will be adjudicated by MOM through the Labour Court.&nbsp; Sir, could there be a system of adverse cost implications which will further facilitate and encourage settlement?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To illustrate, if the offeror offers a certain settlement sum but this is not accepted by the offeree, and the offeror subsequently obtains a judgement which is more favourable than the settlement sum, the offeree (who previously refused to accept the settlement sum offered by the offeror) may be penalised as the court deems fit.&nbsp; Sir, this system of adverse cost implications will deter parties from trying their luck in arriving at unrealistic settlement sums during mediation process. &nbsp;In fact, this system of adverse implications has been applied in normal litigation procedures and has proven to be effective in speeding up settlement out of court.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as much as we want PMEs to make use of the new scheme, we also <p align=left>Column: 1577<p>hope that an agreement between PMEs and their employers may be reached harmoniously in the event of a dispute with as little damage to their relationship as possible.&nbsp; Hence, a settlement out of court should always be the top priority, with litigation being the very last resort.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this, I look forward to TAFEP playing an effective role.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this note, I support the Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Fatimah Lateef:</B> Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this Bill.&nbsp; I welcome the fine-tuning proposed and especially with regard to clarification&nbsp;of certain definitions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tripartite mediation is indeed a positive step but as there are&nbsp; eligibility guidelines, can I enquire what options are then available for the cases that are not eligible for tripartite mediation?&nbsp; What other forms of recourse do these employees have?&nbsp; Why do we use a salary cut-off at the $4,500 mark?&nbsp; With this cut-off limit, the number of executives accessible to mediation would be reduced significantly (approximately, as quoted in the media, for&nbsp;46,000 based on estimates when there are actually&nbsp;about 500,000 of&nbsp;PMETs earning up to $4,500 a&nbsp;month in Singapore).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, what other forms of mediation between employer and employee, eg, community mediation or mediation through other sources, can these employees seek? &nbsp;If an employee decided on these other options, are there criteria&nbsp;that require them to keep their employers updated?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if the employee has a legal representative which he appoints?&nbsp; Will there be any specific differences to the approach?&nbsp; Sir, at my Meet-the-People <p align=left>Column: 1578<p>Sessions, I see cases where residents have engaged a legal representative for their work-related issues, but somehow the residents are still being advised by these legal representatives to seek advice and assistance&nbsp;from the Member of Parliament.&nbsp; In such cases relating to work, can the employee then, whose legal representative has really&nbsp;not been&nbsp;representative or left him in a lurch, seek assistance from the Tripartite Mediation Committee?&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, Sir, why is it that only finance- and salary-related cases can be heard in the Labour Court?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In specialised industries,&nbsp;can the Minister please elaborate&nbsp;on the possibility of giving consideration to inputs from experts and&nbsp;specialists?&nbsp;&nbsp;Can specific requests be made for them to sit on the mediation panel and&nbsp;will the&nbsp;employees have to sort these out themselves or can MOM assist?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, I hope the Minister can also comment on the use of collective or group mediation in specific circumstances&nbsp;as they may arise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I also support the amendment to increase the range of penalties stipulated for all the different sections.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, I support this Amendment Bill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>5.59 pm</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have just three points to make.&nbsp; The first is that my union, the Singapore Industrial and Services Employees Union, fully supports the dispute resolution framework.&nbsp; Currently, only PMEs who earn a basic salary of $2,500 and below can go through the Labour Court for salary claims.&nbsp; Under the new framework, this cap will be increased to $4,500.&nbsp; The increase in salary limit will provide many&nbsp;PMEs a much less costly <p align=left>Column: 1579<p>avenue than engaging a lawyer to pursue their claims in the civil courts.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to salary claims, PMEs who are&nbsp;General Branch Members&nbsp;working in non-unionised companies and who earn up to a basic salary of $4,500 can also refer issues on retrenchment benefits and breach of individual&nbsp;employment contracts.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;mediation advisers would also be able to support our members at the&nbsp;meeting.&nbsp; An added benefit for union members is that employers now have an obligation, under law, to attend the mediation meetings.&nbsp; This is a great improvement as we have&nbsp;previously experienced difficulties in getting some of the employers to show up.&nbsp; A lot of time and effort were wasted in arranging the meetings as the employer representatives may not turn up at the last minute, so we support this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second point is to raise some concerns on the effectiveness of this framework.&nbsp; One of the factors that determine the effectiveness of the mediation process is really the quality and the experience of the advisers appointed by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).&nbsp; Employment terms and conditions vary across industries and so, ideally, the mediation advisers&nbsp;should have a wealth of knowledge about the best practices in the industry that the&nbsp;mediating parties belong to.&nbsp; They should also be reputable individuals in their own fields of expertise so that they have the credibility with the mediating parties.&nbsp; I hope that MOM could consider these attributes in the&nbsp;appointment of the tripartite mediation advisers.&nbsp; Also, under the new framework, employers could still object to the PMEs being represented by the union under three different categories, namely, senior management, employees involved in industrial relation functions and employees with functions that may give rise to conflict of interest.&nbsp; Sir, in theory, this is to afford a level of comfort to employers in their staff management.&nbsp; In practice, we are concerned with the over-titling of <p align=left>Column: 1580<p>PMEs so as to exclude them from being represented by the unions.&nbsp; So, in determining whether an employer's objection is valid, I urge MOM to put in place an impartial and effective body and process to review the actual job scope function, duties and powers of the PME in question.&nbsp; This is to ensure that PMEs would not fall out of the dispute resolution framework which is the safety net only because of the titles that they are holding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third point is on the future developments that we hope to see MOM making with regard to this framework.&nbsp; The proposed dispute resolution mechanism is a step forward towards better employment protection for the PMEs.&nbsp; However, even with the tripartite mediation process, the results are not enforceable on either party.&nbsp; The employer could choose not to accept the advice of the tripartite body and the PME may still have to pursue his case under the civil courts.&nbsp; Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister how he intends to ensure the effectiveness of the process.&nbsp; Secondly, the areas that the PME could raise his issues on are also limited to the three main areas under the new mechanism, ie, salary claims, breach of individual contracts and retrenchment benefits.&nbsp; Under the limited representation coverage of the Industrial Relations Act, unfair dismissal is also one area that the unions could represent their members on.&nbsp; So, I hope that in time to come, MOM could expand the coverage of the dispute resolution framework to also include unfair dismissal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to just make some concluding remarks in Mandarin, please.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2010/20101122/20101122VS_102944.pdf \"\">Appendix A</a>*</I>.]&nbsp;I know that some employers, especially those from SMEs, have some reservations and concerns about the amendment.&nbsp;

First, if you have always treated your employees well, you do not need to be worried at all because the union will, consistent with our practice all along,&nbsp;&nbsp;be reasonable in handling industrial disputes.&nbsp; Second, for those companies that are not&nbsp;yet unionised, I urge them to reconsider their position, because harmonious labour-management relations can have a very strong and positive impact on business success.&nbsp; I, myself, support this Bill and I hope that employers will also understand and support this mediation mechanism which has been very carefully considered by the tripartite partners.</p></span></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Paulin Straughan for their strong support of the Bill.&nbsp; I am glad that they all supported the Bill.&nbsp; In fact, many MPs are already asking for more even before we have started.&nbsp; Let me respond to some of their comments and questions.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Members, including Mr Heng and Assoc. Prof. Fatimah&nbsp;Lateef, have asked why there is a salary ceiling of $4,500.&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Lateef seems to have the impression that the salary ceiling has effectively reduced the number of eligible PMEs from 500,000 to 46,000.&nbsp; That is not so.&nbsp; As I have mentioned in my main speech, with the salary ceiling of $4,500, it will cover about 500,000 PMEs, that is, about half of the PMEs in our local workforce.&nbsp; The new mechanism is really intended to provide PMEs with a low cost and expeditious way to resolve their employment disputes.&nbsp; We have consulted the tripartite partners who agreed that this salary ceiling of $4,500 is <p align=left>Column: 1582<p>reasonable for a start since it covers more than half of PMEs in the workforce in about three-quarters of the 280 PME mediation cases we received annually, on average, over the last three years.&nbsp; We will monitor the situation as we implement the new mechanism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah Lateef has asked about the recourse available for PMEs who are not eligible for tripartite mediation.&nbsp; MOM will continue to provide voluntary mediation services through our Executive Mediation Unit (EMU).&nbsp; PMEs can also seek mediation through other sources and other avenues, if they wish.&nbsp; All PMEs earning $4,500 and below will have access to the Labour Court for adjudication of salary claims.&nbsp; Higher income PMEs can still pursue their claims through the civil courts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Teo and Mdm Halimah have suggested that MOM should put in place an effective process to assess the objections from the employers on their employees' eligibility for tripartite mediation.&nbsp; Yes, we will do that and the inputs of the tripartite mediation advisers (TMAs) will be sought where relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Ho has asked whether there could be a one-stop centre for all employment disputes.&nbsp; Sir, given the diverse nature of the employment disputes, it is necessary to provide alternative avenues depending on the nature of the dispute rather than a one-stop centre.&nbsp; Nevertheless, employees and employers can approach MOM for advice with regard to their disputes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members such as Mrs Teo have suggested that the new mechanism be expanded to cover other types of disputes like unfair dismissal.&nbsp; As this is a new tripartite mediation mechanism, let us start with the more common types of dispute for mediation and we can review the scope in future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1583<p> Assoc. Prof. Fatimah&nbsp;Lateef has also asked about the use of collective or group mediation in cases involving a large group of employees with similar dispute with the same employer.&nbsp; We can consider mediating as a group to facilitate a more efficient process.&nbsp; However, we have to make sure that this is done without compromising the flexibility of different settlement for each case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For tripartite mediation to be effective, I agree with Assoc. Prof. Straughan, Mdm Halimah, Assoc.&nbsp;Prof.&nbsp;Fatimah Lateef as well as Mrs Teo that the TMAs appointed must be experienced in human resource and industrial relations matters as well as knowledgeable about industries' employment practices.&nbsp; This will ensure that they will be effective in facilitating the mediation process.&nbsp; I will be inviting nominations from our tripartite partners, the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) and the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) on suitable candidates for TMAs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Fatimah&nbsp;Lateef has asked if legal representatives or other experts and specialists can participate in tripartite mediation.&nbsp; To keep the process low cost, third-party legal representatives will not be allowed during tripartite mediation.&nbsp; However, we can allow other experts or specialists to participate in the tripartite mediation upon requests if their involvement can help to facilitate an amicable resolution of the dispute.&nbsp; For example, the PME concerned can request for an officer from the trade union of which he is a member while the employer can seek the assistance of any business or employer organisation of which the employer is a member.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng and Mrs Teo have asked about how we can make tripartite mediation more effective.&nbsp; Mr Heng has asked whether we can have the mediation outcome binding on both parties.&nbsp; Mdm Ho has further suggested a system of <p align=left>Column: 1584<p>adverse cost implications to make the mediation process more efficient.&nbsp; Sir, I would like to point out that&nbsp;tripartite mediation provides an opportunity for parties to explore options to reach settlement terms that are mutually acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, it is not appropriate to make the mediation outcome binding.&nbsp; If the dispute could not be amicably settled through tripartite mediation and involves&nbsp;salary claims, the case can be adjudicated at the Labour Court where it could make an order based on the validity of the claim.&nbsp; The order will be binding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assoc. Prof. Straughan has asked if the outcomes of mediation can be made known to the public.&nbsp; It may be difficult to do so due to the confidentiality nature of such settlements.&nbsp; However, my Ministry could provide broad trends as well as share some of the best practices to help to minimise disputes and enhance workplace harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Zainudin Nordin has also pointed out that having good employment practices will indeed enhance workplace harmony.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah has asked for the rationale for introducing the new $20,000 cap on claims for adjudication and also suggested that this be reviewed regularly together with the scope of adjudication.&nbsp; Sir, all claims lodged by PMEs with MOM so far fall within this limit. We do want to encourage PMEs to bring their salary claim issues to MOM as early as possible to avoid salary arrears from accumulating to a large amount.&nbsp; On the scope of adjudication, salaries are fundamental employment right of employees.&nbsp; It is also the most common employment issue.&nbsp; It is already a significant step to extend the adjudication to PMEs earning up to $4,500 a month.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I believe I have addressed Members' concerns and queries.&nbsp; Once again, let me thank Members of the <p align=left>Column: 1585<p>House for supporting this Bill.&nbsp; In summary, the new mechanism will provide additional channels for PMEs and their employers to resolve their employment disputes.&nbsp; We have worked closely with the tripartite partners to design a system that is workable and fair to all parties.&nbsp; With the support of tripartite partners, I am confident that we can work together to implement this new mechanism effectively and help foster workplace harmony to benefit all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It aims to nurture a sense of social responsibility and help students understand that everyone can play a part in bettering the community.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools prepare their students for CIP.&nbsp; Teachers provide proper structure, guidance and supervision so as to engage their students. For example, as a preparation for CIP, students at Nanyang Junior College discuss community needs during Civics tutorials to raise awareness of social issues in the community, while students from Ang Mo Kio Secondary School play an active part in identifying organisations they want to work with for their CIP.&nbsp; Not only do teachers prepare their students beforehand, they also encourage them to reflect on their learning after they take part in a CIP activity.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Education (MOE) agrees that the CIP serves as an important first step to encouraging long-term involvement in community service. Even though CIP is no longer compulsory at the Junior College (JC) level, MOE's surveys show that JC students continue to actively participate in CIP, with many students initiating their own CIP projects. This is a positive outcome.&nbsp; However, MOE will retain the current approach of mandating six hours of community service per year at the primary and secondary school levels, as this serves as a platform to introduce all students to community involvement.&nbsp; Students can decide whether to go beyond this minimum requirement and indeed, many primary and secondary school students choose to perform more than six hours of community service per year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sustain volunteerism beyond the school years, MOE encourages schools to forge long-term partnerships with community organisations to deepen the quality of the CIP experience for our students and to allow for continuity of contribution beyond the schooling years.&nbsp; Schools also encourage their students to tap on national platforms such as National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre's (NVPC) Singapore Cares, which is an on-line platform offering volunteering opportunities for individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOE will continue to review the CIP and work with partner agencies, such as the NVPC, to engage students in community service both while they are in school and after they graduate.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1589<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RULES FOR PUBLIC OFFICERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:RULES FOR PUBLIC OFFICERS:::1590--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>RULES FOR PUBLIC OFFICERS</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:On visiting gaming places--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(On visiting gaming places)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Prime Minister in view of recent cases of cheating involving civil servants (a) what is the rule for public officers who visit gaming places such as casinos and the Singapore Turf Club; and (b) whether there are public officers who hold sensitive positions who are barred from visiting such gambling establishments.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All civil servants are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which upholds the integrity of the Public Service and public confidence in it.

Any person who forges a vehicle licence plate, or uses a forged licence plate, is liable, upon conviction, to a fine of up to $5,000, or a jail term of up to 12 months, or both.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licence plates are checked regularly during the periodic vehicle inspections mandated by LTA to ensure that they bear the registration numbers assigned to the vehicle. We share&nbsp;the Member's&nbsp;concern on the recent case of illegal duplication of car licence plates, and will continue to take strict enforcement action against any vehicle owners and vehicle licence plate suppliers who forge plates. LTA&nbsp;records show that, over the past&nbsp;three years, the number of illegal duplication of vehicle licence plates was consistently low at an <p align=left>Column: 1591<p>average of&nbsp;seven per year. These statistics do not justify LTA making it mandatory for vehicle licence plate suppliers to verify vehicle registration and ownership details before fitting the plates onto vehicles.

Similarly, the statistics do not warrant LTA raising the penalties for such offences</p><p>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, LTA will monitor the situation closely and re-look into the need to regulate vehicle licence plate suppliers and increase the penalties for illegal forgery of vehicle licence plates should the problem become more serious.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1591<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FUND TO IMPROVE TAXI RIDERSHIP--><!--END_COL_TITLE:FUND TO IMPROVE TAXI RIDERSHIP:::1594--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FUND TO IMPROVE TAXI RIDERSHIP</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Audrey Wong Wai Yen </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) what has been the impact of the $1 million fund launched last year to improve taxi ridership; (b) whether the Ministry conducts annual service audits of taxi companies to ensure that they are meeting consumers' needs and expectations and changing commuter patterns; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider further measures to professionalise taxi drivers, such as accreditation to raise the perceived job status of taxi driving.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the $1 million Taxi Fund, which LTA set up last year, in consultation with the taxi companies and the National Taxi Association (NTA), was intended as a temporary measure to provide some help to the taxi industry given the expectations then of a severe economic downturn.&nbsp; However, as this is public money, any potential use of the Fund had to fulfil three objectives. First, it should help to improve the service levels of taxi drivers, for example, by supporting initiatives such as programmes on good service behaviours. Second, there is a co-funding element where only up to one-third of the cost of any promotional activities proposed by taxi companies would be taken from the Fund, and it must not involve a direct subsidy of taxi fares. And, lastly, the Fund could also be used to improve demand by improving convenience and accessibility for taxi commuters during major events such as the Singapore River Hongbao, through the construction of additional infrastructure facilities such as temporary taxi stands.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As indicated in the reply to a parliamentary question last year, the Fund is open to application by taxi companies and only proposals that meet the stipulated requirements will be approved.&nbsp; While a $1 million budget has been set aside, actual utilisation will depend on the merits of the proposals LTA receives. To date, LTA has received a number of applications and one proposal has been approved for co-funding. LTA also has plans to make use of some of the funds to improve taxi information at taxi stands in the next few months. In addition, LTA is intending to tap on the fund to construct temporary taxi stands around the Chinatown area during the Singapore River Hongbao early next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Ms Wong's query on the service performance of taxi companies in meeting commuters' needs, I wish to highlight that LTA requires all taxi companies to comply with service performance standards under the monthly Quality of Service (QoS) standards. The QoS standards are categorised in three main areas, namely, the availability of taxis via call booking, safety and customer satisfaction. LTA monitors taxi companies' performance very closely and penalties are levied on companies that fail to meet the required standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1593<p>In addition, LTA monitors commuters' waiting time at taxi stands with high demand. LTA also conducts monthly public opinion survey of taxi companies' service provision and quarterly mystery customer audits of the service delivery by taxi drivers. Besides sharing these waiting times and survey/audit information with taxi companies, regular meetings with them and the taxi drivers' associations are held to see if there are gaps in service delivery and how best to address them. LTA is currently reviewing how service in the taxi industry can be further improved to better meet the needs of commuters and will announce the improvements by early next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On measures to professionalise taxi drivers, LTA has been working with the Singapore Taxi Academy (STA) on a number of initiatives. In July 2010, a computer-based English assessment, the Workplace Literacy-Computer Adaptive Test (WPL-CAT), was adopted as a more comprehensive and systematic method of testing the English proficiency of Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) applicants. This replaced the English assessment interviews conducted by the STA for TDVL applicants who do not possess a GCE \"O\" or \"N\" level pass in English. Under the new WPL-CAT regime, TDVL applicants are required to obtain at least a Level 3 pass in the three areas tested&nbsp;&ndash; Listening, Reading and Speaking, before they are allowed to enroll in the TDVL course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the knowledge of our taxi drivers is up-to-date, TDVL holders are required to attend a refresher course once every&nbsp;six years. LTA will continue to work with the STA to improve the training of taxi drivers so as to deliver higher service standards for our commuters.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1593<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SIGN-UP RATE FOR CPF LIFE--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SIGN-UP RATE FOR CPF LIFE:::1596--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SIGN-UP RATE FOR CPF LIFE</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Such an outcome would not be in the interest of the travelling public and Singapore as an air hub.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our approach has thus been to allow market forces to influence the level of service standards offered by the airlines.&nbsp; Given the keen market competition, the airlines are well aware that they will have to meet their passengers' expectations or risk losing these customers. The LCCs have recognised this and are starting to address customer feedback and take additional measures to improve customer service. One LCC has issued a customer guarantee commitment, while another has created a task force to look into improving communications with its passengers(1).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, to help the public make more informed travel choices, the CAAS is stepping up efforts to raise awareness on what service levels travellers can expect from airlines, including what to look out for when purchasing air tickets, and the avenues of recourse in the event of airline service lapses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passengers affected by airline service lapses have various avenues of recourse.&nbsp; They can take up the matter directly with the airline; and if transactions were carried out in Singapore seek assistance from the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE), or lodge a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; Where there are unfair practices, recourse is further available under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CAAS will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with stakeholders, including airlines and the operator Changi Airport Group, to ensure that the travelling public is well served through a fair, open and competitive air travel market.<br></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p>(1) The LCCs referred to are Jetstar Group and Tiger Airways respectively.</p><BR></div></P></div>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 1597<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE'S FUTURE-READINESS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SINGAPORE'S FUTURE-READINESS:::1602--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SINGAPORE'S FUTURE-READINESS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Miss Penny Low </B>asked the Prime Minister (a) whether a report on the state of Singapore's future-readiness has been made; (b) if so, what is the outlook in terms of Singapore's (i) economic future-readiness in riding the changing tides of the global trade routes and industry sectors; and (ii) social future-readiness in engaging our people and building social capital; and (c) what can the private, public and people sectors do to help Singapore become more future-ready.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the hallmarks of Singapore's success has been our ability to position ourselves for the future and to navigate uncertainties nimbly.&nbsp; Change is a constant but the rate of change has accelerated in recent times. More than ever, we need to be alert to possible challenges and opportunities over the horizon. It also means building the capabilities today which will allow us to be flexible and adaptable enough to refine our strategies, if and when the need arises.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While there is no report on the state of Singapore's future-readiness <I>per se</I>, this Government has a strong track record in ensuring that Singapore is future-ready. This is because we are able to stay focused on long-term goals and put in place the correct policies for Singapore in good time. For example, the structural reforms following the major economic reviews in 1986 and 2003 positioned Singapore well to ride the waves of global growth that followed each report. Similarly, the Economic Strategies Committee's recommendations in February this year are aimed at positioning Singapore to benefit from the shifts in global economic conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Policies like Workfare and CPF LIFE and tax reforms like the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax and the reduction in income taxes were also introduced with a view to helping Singapore and Singaporeans prepare for a more competitive global economic environment in which people are expected to live longer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the social dimension, we have continually invested in our social capital to meet new challenges through initiatives like the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles. Government agencies have made strides in engaging with citizens and civil society groups in fields as diverse as urban conservation and land transport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the Government's efforts in long-term strategic planning, through tried-and-tested approaches like scenario planning since the early 1990s, have helped us to make sense of our complex operating environment, identify strategic threats and opportunities, and plan for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, we have also introduced the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning system to complement scenario planning, set up the Centre for Strategic Futures (CSF) and established a network for senior officials from all Ministries to discuss emerging issues and risks. These initiatives are all aimed at strengthening the Government's anticipatory capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1599<p>Ms Low also asked what the public, private and people sectors could do to help Singapore become more future-ready. Indeed, making sure that Singapore is prepared for the future must be a collective, national effort. The private and people sectors are rich sources of fresh insights that can better inform public policymaking and planning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conducting its scenario projects, the Government consults extensively with people from diverse backgrounds. Such engagements provide us with a more complete picture of what the future could be like. The CSF also reaches out to local and international think-tanks, academics and consultants, and participates actively in global gatherings of leading thinkers. Actively seeking out people with fresh perspectives and listening to alternative voices help us to guard against the pitfalls of groupthink. Keeping our channels of communication open is critical in ensuring that we harness our collective national wisdom, and co-create robust national strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 2009 study by the Institute of Management Development (IMD) called the Stress Test on Competitiveness 2009 ranked Singapore 2nd among 57 countries. This study was future-oriented, and focused on exposure, readiness and resilience in a period of world recession. It provides some external validation that we are doing the right things to prepare Singapore for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and whether Singapore can weather future storms or take advantage of future opportunities will critically continue to depend on the people and private sectors working with the Government, in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect, and in the context of a strong Government that is able to provide sound leadership.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give three examples of how the public, private and people sectors have worked together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the Economic Strategies Committee (ESC) process, started in May 2009 and completed in February 2010, was an example of how the public, private and people sectors worked together to formulate long-term growth strategies for Singapore's economic transformation. It focused on building capabilities and maximising emerging opportunities to achieve sustained and inclusive growth. This process, which was led by the Minister for Finance, involved extensive collaborations with individuals from across Government, academia and industry. All in, more than 1,000 people contributed their views. The ESC was, in essence, a national effort to build economic resilience and put Singapore in good stead to, as Ms Low put it, \"ride the changing tides of the global trade routes and industry sectors\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, the Government similarly cannot build social resilience alone. Our Many Helping Hands approach is an example of how the public, private and people sectors can work together to build social resilience. Here, the collective efforts of Government, grassroots organisations, VWOs, philanthropic organisations and businesses are harnessed to foster a supportive, caring and compassionate society, and to anticipate and address problems before they surface.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, strong partnerships among the public, private and people sectors have helped us to develop solutions to tackle the question of Singapore's environmental sustainability. Our Environment Ministry set up a series of focus group discussions, comprising representatives from across the three sectors. The groups discussed issues related to <p align=left>Column: 1601<p>economic development, public health and regional and international matters, and the reports of their discussions have fed into the Singapore Green Plan 2012&nbsp;&ndash; Singapore's blueprint toward environmental sustainability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These consultations and collaborations should be encouraged, and I look forward to hearing suggestions from the private and people sectors on how we can continue to work together to prepare Singapore well for the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore was ranked&nbsp;second in the International Institute for Management Development's (IMD) Stress Test, an analysis based on the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2009 that assesses which countries are better equipped to bounce back from recession. The findings were future-oriented, and focused on exposure, readiness and resilience in a period of world recession. Denmark was in&nbsp;first place; China was 18th; the US was 28th; the UK was 34th.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore was the highest ranked Asian state in a global index of wealth and social resilience in the Caux Round Table's 2009 Social Achievement Capital Country rankings. The study ranked 200 countries according to pillars such as economic activity, quality of life and legal and political institutions. Singapore was in 14th place, ahead of the US and Britain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1601<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:E-FILING OF GENERAL ELECTION FORMS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:E-FILING OF GENERAL ELECTION FORMS:::1602--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In this regard, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been working with stakeholders to build a deep and vibrant bond market.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The financial crisis over the last&nbsp;two years has however shown that what may be perceived as less complex or safe products may not necessarily be so in a turbulent market. While investment products such as plain vanilla corporate bonds are less complex than structured notes, these products still carry investment risks, including counterparty and interest rate risks.&nbsp; These risks also vary across issuers and market cycles.&nbsp; For instance, while such products may appear attractive in the current low interest rate environment, their prices may be affected when interest rates rise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Securities and Futures Act requires the disclosure of all information that retail investors and their professional advisers would reasonably require to make an informed assessment of the product. This includes the risks associated with the issuer as well as the product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, MAS, in consultation with the industry, conducted a review of the regulatory regime for listed and unlisted investment products and has developed proposals to further safeguard consumers' interests and promote higher industry standards. MAS aims to put in place the necessary legislation to effect these changes by 2011.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investors must also play their part in making informed investment decisions and invest in their own financial literacy. The financial crisis has reinforced the importance of investors equipping themselves with the necessary knowledge and skills and investing <p align=left>Column: 1605<p>only in products that they understand. MoneySENSE was launched in 2003 as a national financial education programme to provide consumers with knowledge and skills to enable them to make informed financial decisions. More recently, MoneySENSE has stepped up efforts to educate consumers on specific investment products. This includes arranging educational seminars and publishing articles on what consumers should consider before investing in various investment products such as structured notes and Singapore Government Securities. MoneySENSE has also been partnering MediaCorp on a series of \"Mind Your Money\" seminars and radio programmes to bring financial education to consumers.&nbsp; Going forward, MoneySENSE will be working with media to educate consumers on various new and common investment products offered to retail investors.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1605<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CLOSURES OF SPA OPERATORS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:CLOSURES OF SPA OPERATORS:::1606--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CLOSURES OF SPA OPERATORS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry in light of the sudden spa closures by spa operators (a) what is the Ministry doing to protect the image of Singapore as a regional spa centre; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider disallowing spa operators from signing up treatment packages that are more than six months to protect the interest of the customers.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) does not actively promote Singapore as a regional spa centre.&nbsp; Spa experiences are profiled only as one of the many visitor experiences that tourists can enjoy in Singapore, alongside shopping, dining, events and entertainment offerings.&nbsp; STB has been careful to profile only spas that have a sound business model and proven track record.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imposing prescriptive regulations can restrict business flexibility, reduce consumer choice, and potentially lead to higher costs for consumers.&nbsp; A better approach to protect consumers is to help raise their vigilance through consumer education and industry accreditation of spas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Consumers' Association of Singapore (CASE)&nbsp;has, with MTI's support, launched the CaseTrust for Spa and Wellness Accreditation Scheme in April this year to raise consumers' awareness of spa standards and to put in place good business practices.&nbsp; These include giving customers a cooling-off period of at least five working days to seek full refund of payments made for packages, and not allowing sales pitch to customers during treatment.&nbsp; These measures will help obviate cases where consumers are pressured into buying packages.&nbsp; CASE is also currently looking into requiring financial soundness to be taken into account in the accreditation scheme.&nbsp; We will monitor the situation and refine our approach further, if necessary.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1605<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:GLOBAL INVESTOR PROGRAMME--><!--END_COL_TITLE:GLOBAL INVESTOR PROGRAMME:::1608--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>GLOBAL INVESTOR PROGRAMME</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) how many investors were granted PR status under the Global Investor Programme (GIP) over the last three years and what was the cumulative amount of their investments; (b) where are these investors from and how many of them operate from Singapore; (c) what are the employment opportunities generated by these investors over the last three years; and (d) how does Singapore's GIP compare with those in other countries and whether our GIP guidelines are too stringent.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><p align=left>Column: 1607<p><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Global Investor Programme (GIP) is intended to attract entrepreneurs setting up business or investing in Singapore to make Singapore their home.

The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) has commissioned a gambling prevalence study which should be completed in the second half of 2011. The study is a follow up on the Ministry for Community Development, Youth and Sports' (MCYS) two earlier gambling prevalence studies done in 2005 and 2008.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1613<p>On its part, NCPG will continue its work in two key areas: issuing casino exclusion orders and encouraging problem gamblers and their families to come forward for help.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NCPG has put in place three types of casino exclusions as part of the social safeguards. These are Third-Party Exclusions which ban by <I>fiat</I> all undischarged bankrupts and those on public assistance from the casinos; voluntary Self-Exclusions that allow individuals to restrict their own access to the casinos; and Family Exclusions that empower families to prevent their members who exhibit problem gambling behaviour from entering the casinos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As at September this year, NCPG has issued over 35,000 Third-Party Exclusion orders. More germane to concern raised would be Self-Exclusion and Family Exclusion. Up to September 2010, there have been over 2,500 Self-Exclusion applications, close to 90% of which were applied after the casinos opened. The NCPG has also issued 194 Family Exclusion orders, and 163 of these were issued since the casinos opened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NCPG works with Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre and the National Addictions Management Service (NAMS) to provide, respectively, counseling and treatment services for problem gamblers and their families. From January to September 2010, Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre has had an intake of 76 new clients.&nbsp; This is compared to 90 new cases in 2009 and 52 new cases in 2008. During the same period, NAMS had an intake of 130 new clients, compared to 210 new cases in 2009 and 131 new cases in 2008.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The more likely reason for the rise in casino exclusion orders is the greater awareness of the avenues available and willingness to seek help.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the NCPG conducted its first Public Perception Survey in 2006, public awareness of problem gambling was only 32%. It has since risen to 71% in 2009.&nbsp; About one in two Singapore residents are also now aware of casino exclusions. NCPG has also reached out to about 1.2 million Singapore residents through ground initiatives such as at the <I>getai</I> since it launched its Know the Line campaign.

As a result, our taxi industry is a competitive one where companies have the flexibility to increase their taxi fleet and new entrants can enter the market to cater to the increase in taxi demand.&nbsp; Taxi companies are also able to employ differential pricing through the implementation of surcharges to meet the varying taxi demand at different times of the day and at different locations.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although it is a liberalised industry, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) continues to monitor the service standards and availability of taxis.&nbsp; In consultation with various stakeholders, LTA has instituted Quality of Service (QoS) standards that include measuring the call-booking performance of taxi companies.&nbsp; LTA also monitors the waiting times at taxi stands with high demand that are located in the city and city fringe areas.&nbsp; The results show that taxi companies are meeting the QoS standards for call booking, and that the average waiting time at taxi stands is generally less than 15 minutes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1617<p>There were, however, occurrences when the waiting times at some taxi stands in the city area exceeded 20 minutes. These were mainly during the 9.00-10.00 pm period and due to the surge in demand for taxis when shopping malls closed.&nbsp; LTA recognises that these malls have an interest in managing the waiting times for their customers, and have been working with some of them to look at ways to facilitate improvements at these taxi stands. These include looking at ways to increase the space for taxis to queue, and facilitate the mall management in calling up taxi companies to broadcast to taxis in the vicinity to ply at taxi stands where the queue is long. In addition, LTA works with the taxi companies by sharing the results of waiting time surveys at taxi stands with them for the information to be disseminated to their drivers.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1617<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS:::1620--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATORS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Low Thia Khiang </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) whether sufficient fire safety measures are in place on public transport; and&nbsp; (b) what role does the Government play to ensure that public transport operators meet fire safety standards.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority (LTA) works closely with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) to ensure that adequate fire safety measures are put into place to safeguard commuters' interests.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our public transport infrastructure, such as the Rapid Transit System (RTS) stations and tunnels, as well as bus interchanges and depots, are designed in compliance with prevailing fire safety codes and standards.&nbsp; For example, the MRT stations are built with non-combustible building materials, and equipped with emergency ventilation systems, fire protection systems and emergency lightings.&nbsp; Stations are built with adequate exits so that commuters can evacuate from the platform and station within prescribed timings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our trains and buses are also designed for fire safety, with fixtures such as fire extinguishers and emergency exits built in to handle fire scenarios. In addition, the bus operators undertake additional safety measures such as using fire-retardant materials for seats and floor mats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the regulatory standards imposed on the Public Transport Operators (PTOs) to ensure safety of the RTS system, the LTA has stipulated zero occurrence of fire incidents in trains, stations and tunnels to ensure that fire safety standards are observed at all times during the PTOs' day-to-day operations. The Public Transport Council (PTC) also sets Quality of Service (QoS) standards relating to the operational safety of bus services.&nbsp; If the PTOs are found to be in breach of the stipulated standards, the LTA or PTC may impose a financial penalty according to the severity of the occurrence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To further ensure that the PTOs are capable of dealing with a fire scenario, the SCDF requires PTOs to conduct at least two fire safety drills in the MRT stations each year. The PTOs are also required to renew their Fire Certificate each year to ensure each station's fire safety standards are up-to-date. On their part, the PTOs conduct regular training and exercises to continuously update their staff of the latest fire safety standards and practices as well as measures to ensure the prompt recovery of public transport services should a fire incident occur.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1619<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SPECIAL IMMIGRATION COUNTERS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:SPECIAL IMMIGRATION COUNTERS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS:::1620--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SPECIAL IMMIGRATION COUNTERS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Seah Kian Peng </B>asked the Minister for Home Affairs given the ageing population, whether the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will consider dedicating some immigration counters specifically for senior citizens and their family members.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Shanmugam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) cleared 149 million travellers at our Checkpoints. Since the beginning of 2010, more than 122 million travellers have passed through our Checkpoints. In an increasingly dynamic and complex security environment, ICA faces an uphill challenge in ensuring efficient clearance without compromising security, even while we recognise the extra assistance that some senior citizens may require at our Checkpoints.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ICA has in place several measures for senior citizens who need assistance. For example, ICA will allow a family member to accompany the senior citizen when he is at the immigration counter, instead of the latter having to seek immigration clearance on his own. ICA and the Changi Airport Group have also implemented a new joint initiative called Care@Changi to provide facilitated clearance for passengers with special needs such as pregnant women, travellers with infants, wheelchair-bound passengers and elderly persons. Under this initiative, Changi Ambassadors, who are volunteer youths and retirees, will help escort any such passenger in the queue to the Duty Officer or the air-crew immigration counter for facilitated clearance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the diversity of travellers passing through the Checkpoints today, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is of the view that adopting a targeted approach to helping those who need assistance without setting up dedicated counters would be more efficient. We will continue to monitor the profile of our Checkpoint users and review Checkpoint operations to ensure an effective border security regime that is also operationally efficient.<br></p></p></span><p align=left>Column: 1619<p>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:LICENSED MONEYLENDERS--><!--END_COL_TITLE:LICENSED MONEYLENDERS:::1622--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>LICENSED MONEYLENDERS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Er Lee Bee Wah </B>asked the Minister for Law with the rising number of newspaper advertisements offering \"soft cash\" loans with approval \"within an hour\" (a) what is the Ministry doing to check on these companies to ensure that they are licensed moneylenders; (b) whether the Ministry monitors the activities of licensed moneylenders; (c) what are the criteria in approving a moneylender's licence; (d) in the past&nbsp;two years, how many moneylenders' licences were terminated because of violation of licensing conditions; and (e) how are licensed moneylenders made accountable for any misconduct.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Shanmugam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Shanmugam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By law, all licensed moneylenders must state their business name in their advertisements and marketing material.
