Since the last\r\nrevision in 2007, the basic ElderShield payout stands at $400 per\r\nmonth for 72 months. With medical inflation and the high cost of\r\nnursing care, this quantum is insufficient to cover the basic medical needs of most low-\r\nand middle-income families.

In the area of caring for our elderly\r\nsick, the financial strains can be debilitating. The strains almost\r\nnearly cut across all social classes particularly more acute for\r\nthe low income and sandwich class. A person with stroke and in a\r\ncomatose condition lying in an intensive care ward for 30 days can\r\neasily chalk up $30,000 on hospitalisation cost alone. Thus, even\r\nwith the 3Ms and subsidised assistance, the financial strains can\r\nbe crippling. Although I applaud the extension of the MediShield coverage\r\nto 90 years in this year's Budget, I believe we can do more.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-9c5868b0-2f5f-46eb-83b7-fadccb554141\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-9c5868b0-2f5f-46eb-83b7-fadccb554141\"><!--a--></a>The twilight years of\r\na person's life are the period when they utilise the most healthcare.\r\nA person living long beyond the age of 80 would probably have stopped working\r\nfor at least 15 years.

It is meant to help cover the cost of major hospital\r\nbills. Unfortunately, some of those who need MediShield coverage\r\nthe most, like babies\r\nwith congenital problems and the very old, are often denied coverage.\r\nMediShield currently covers 92% of Singaporeans. Those who are not covered\r\ninclude some of the elderly, homemakers and others who have voluntarily opted\r\nout of MediShield. Some are not able to obtain MediShield coverage\r\ndue to pre-existing conditions. I would like to ask what the Ministry\r\nis doing to help achieve a higher level of MediShield coverage for\r\nall Singaporeans. What is the Ministry's targeted level of MediShield\r\ncoverage? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2132</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-83218c70-1d58-4504-8305-45129d7e98a1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-83218c70-1d58-4504-8305-45129d7e98a1\"><!--a--></a>Currently, newborns with\r\ncongenital conditions are either denied MediShield coverage completely\r\nor have their conditions excluded from coverage. This does nothing\r\nto relieve the financial hardship that parents of these children\r\nmay face. In order to ensure that these children are adequately\r\ncovered under the MediShield, will the Ministry consider providing\r\npregnant women an option to buy a MediShield rider to cover for\r\nany congenital problems or prematurity-related complications? This\r\nshould naturally be done before any problems are diagnosed. It would\r\nbe a one-off payment for the rider and it could actuarially be adjusted\r\nupwards for older women as they are at a higher risk of having babies\r\nwith congenital problems or prematurity-related complications. This\r\nwill provide the insurance coverage if the baby is later diagnosed with\r\na problem, yet it would ensure a large enough risk pool to cover\r\nthe potential payouts. Overall, this change should not require any\r\nincreases in premiums.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f658ec07-d2c4-4e71-affc-2ab33141990e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f658ec07-d2c4-4e71-affc-2ab33141990e\"><!--a--></a>As proposed during my\r\nBudget debate speech, will the Ministry consider doing away with\r\nthe age cap of 90 years old for MediShield altogether?

We should\r\nbe doing all we can to help this small group of seniors who have\r\nmade it this far, instead of denying them the insurance coverage\r\nwhen they need it the most.

However, based\r\non the Minister's reply to my Parliamentary Question (PQ), between 2006\r\nand 2010 MediShield collected an average of $131 million more in\r\npremiums each year than it paid out in claims. While I appreciate\r\nthe need to set aside a portion of the premiums as reserves, can\r\nthe Ministry relook at whether the premiums collected can be used\r\nto cover at least part of the increased coverage, instead of passing\r\nthe additional cost entirely to policyholders? Currently MediShield\r\npremiums vary widely according to the members' age from $30 a year\r\nfor those aged below 30, to $1,123 for those in their 80s. This\r\nimposes a heavier burden on older members, many of whom may be retired or\r\nhave exhausted their Medisave.

If\r\nthey are working, their pay may have already been cut as their job\r\nresponsibilities are reduced. If they are already retired, they\r\nworry about making their savings stretch.

In doing so, they have to pay the different\r\ncharges and spend more time travelling as they go for their appointments\r\nat these hospitals and clinics. A few have shared with me that at times,\r\nthey receive repeated referrals in between the polyclinics and hospitals,\r\nmaking them confused\r\nand having to pay more. All these create a lot of inconvenience\r\nto the patients and their family members. The families feel that\r\nthey end up paying more in the management of their illnesses. In\r\naddition, the children of these elders shared with me that they\r\nusually need to take many days of leave to accompany their parents\r\nto the different appointments at the different hospitals and clinics.\r\nThey hope that the Health Ministry will be able to bring a few of\r\nthese services closer to their homes, where they are able to manage\r\ntheir illnesses better. This will result in convenience and possibly more\r\naffordable healthcare.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2136</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6bf8a5b9-75f3-4b83-966e-f76f52f17844\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6bf8a5b9-75f3-4b83-966e-f76f52f17844\"><!--a--></a>Sir, as we increase the\r\nexpenditure on healthcare, I feel that it is important that we also\r\nlook at making primary care more accessible and affordable to Singaporeans.

The GPs may be under-utilised\r\nin this aspect as patients attend polyclinics, emergency departments\r\nin hospitals and specialist outpatient clinics.

The Government provides\r\ndrug subsidies to improve the affordability of commonly used medications.\r\nThe list of subsidised medications, known as the Standard Drug List\r\n(SDL), contains drugs that have been assessed to be cost-effective\r\nand essential. Most SDL drugs are capped at a price of $1.40 per\r\nweek for subsidised patients in the public sector, while the rest\r\nare subsidised at 50% of the retail price.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-77827909-ecb4-416d-9da4-c2c47b261034\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-77827909-ecb4-416d-9da4-c2c47b261034\"><!--a--></a>We recently raised the\r\nsubsidy for some SDL drugs used in the treatment of chronic conditions\r\nto 75%, for patients with per capita household income of $1,500\r\nor less, halving the cost for them.

In addition, the Medication Assistance\r\nFund (MAF) assists Singaporeans who need selective but expensive\r\ndrugs that are not on the SDL with up to 75% subsidy, also up from\r\n50% previously. MAF has also been expanded to include other non-standard\r\ndrugs that are not in the list, if they are assessed to be clinically\r\nnecessary and appropriate for the patients.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4a196e31-e829-4c0b-884b-3b5f0ca9e6be\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4a196e31-e829-4c0b-884b-3b5f0ca9e6be\"><!--a--></a>Together, SDL and MAF\r\nhelp to keep drugs affordable for subsidised patients, often significantly\r\nbelow their cost.

Currently, our clusters purchase\r\ndrugs through a centralised Group Procurement Office (GPO) where\r\npossible. However, some drugs are better purchased at the individual\r\ncluster or hospital-level for various reasons. For example, where\r\nquantities are small, or if the drugs are specific to that institution,\r\nit is better for them to purchase the drugs directly. Price differences could\r\nstill arise, even for drugs purchased via the GPO. For example,\r\nsame drugs purchased in different batches may have different prices\r\nbecause different tenders carry different pricing. So, some hospitals\r\nmay be using drugs from an earlier batch or a later batch so their\r\nbase price will be different, their costs will be different. Also,\r\ninstitutions have different cost structures and therefore we have\r\nto take into account giving institutions some flexibility so that\r\nthey can take into account their different clinical setups and cost\r\nstructures, but they are all subject to general subsidy guidelines.\r\nSome drugs are sold at a higher margin in order to cross-subsidise\r\nother drugs which may be very expensive and therefore need a much\r\nhigher discount to keep them affordable.

Wherever we can, do more with less. One of the ways we\r\nachieve this is through technology. Take tele-ophthalmology, for\r\nexample, which allows ophthalmologists, located in the hospitals,\r\nto \"look into\" the eyes and the retina of patients in the polyclinics.\r\nThe optometrists in the polyclinic prepare the images which are\r\ntransmitted to the hospital ophthalmologists for assessment. Those\r\nwith minor conditions such as dry eyes can receive the medication that\r\nthey need at the polyclinic, and only those with more serious conditions\r\nwill need to be referred to the eye specialist clinic for further\r\nassessment. This brings care to the community level, and cuts down\r\nunnecessary visits to specialists, saving costs for patients and\r\nfreeing up resources of the hospitals. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-998e7039-9f90-49d4-8049-4b07a6d51f87\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-998e7039-9f90-49d4-8049-4b07a6d51f87\"><!--a--></a>To improve efficiency\r\nand productivity in our healthcare system, we will set aside $20 million\r\nfor a fund called Healthcare Productivity in Acute Services Scheme\r\n(Health-PASS).

Through co-payment, the patient\r\nshares part of the responsibility of spending his healthcare dollar smartly.\r\nHe is more likely to weigh the treatment options or choices of drugs\r\nand choose a more cost-effective option. It will also ensure that\r\nhealthcare providers are more cautious in prescribing treatment\r\nto ensure patients can afford the co-payment. We want to avoid the\r\npitfall of countries where healthcare is virtually free, resulting\r\nin an insatiable demand from patients for healthcare services, runaway\r\nhealthcare spending and an increased fiscal burden that is eventually\r\nborne by all taxpayers. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-3d4108eb-2d8b-42f6-8b00-dcb3fd2f2d78\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-3d4108eb-2d8b-42f6-8b00-dcb3fd2f2d78\"><!--a--></a>Sir, I have shared with\r\nMembers the key strategies of Healthcare 2020.

This is a significant statistical figure by any account.\r\nHowever, despite the prevalent of mental illness around the world,\r\nthis category of illness continues to be plagued by stigma that prevents\r\nsocial acceptance and discourages those who need help to step forth\r\nand seek help.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d7d78dc8-1570-49cb-adde-9f4651d0a625\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d7d78dc8-1570-49cb-adde-9f4651d0a625\"><!--a--></a>Therefore, as I have mentioned\r\nin the Budget Speech debate last week, I hope more can be done to\r\nde-stigmatise mental illness, promote greater social acceptance, enhance\r\naccessibility and affordability to professional mental healthcare\r\nand to strengthen the community support framework. First, we should\r\ncombat stigma in order to promote greater social acceptance and\r\nself-acceptance as well as encourage treatment. In fact, I hesitate\r\nto use the label \"mental illness\" and would much prefer the use\r\nof the phrase \"mental health conditions\" or \"mental health issues\".\r\nBut for the purpose of simplicity and familiarity, I would use the\r\nformer phrase for now.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a5df7073-5417-42d9-a32e-d052f3ffb40e\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a5df7073-5417-42d9-a32e-d052f3ffb40e\"><!--a--></a>Studies have shown how\r\ninformation and understanding of various mental illnesses reduce\r\nstigma. Studies have also shown how the media plays a critical role\r\nin propagating and reinforcing negative stereotypes of mental illnesses.\r\nTherefore, would the Ministry share what are the ongoing efforts\r\nto address this issue of stigma and social acceptance? And would\r\nthe Ministry consider: (i) working with the mass media to provide\r\na more objective and balanced coverage of mental illnesses by avoiding\r\nlinking crimes of bad behaviours through mental illness, and instead\r\nhighlighting and celebrating inspiring models such as successful\r\nindividuals who have overcome their mental conditions as well as\r\nshowcasing great works by famous persons who have been known to\r\nhave mental illnesses, for example, Sylvia Plath, Van Gogh, Beethoven, Abraham\r\nLincoln and John Nash; (ii) organising a national campaign to promote\r\ndeeper understanding of a range of mental illnesses, from depression\r\nto eating disorders to sleep disorders, to generalised anxiety disorders,\r\nto personality disorders to OCDs to bipolar to psychosis, and re-image\r\nmental illness as being no different than any other illnesses that\r\nany person could have at any point in time.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6f866d89-9c8a-41f8-aeef-710b2fffa696\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6f866d89-9c8a-41f8-aeef-710b2fffa696\"><!--a--></a>Second, we should strengthen\r\ncommunity care and support framework.

Dr Lam Pin Min passionately\r\nargued that Singaporeans had to build a common understanding of\r\nwhat was needed to create an inclusive society where our people\r\ncan age gracefully and with dignity. I agree with him wholeheartedly\r\nand also with Mr Hri Kumar that we need a national plan to address the\r\nissue of developing facilities for the elderly. As he has elegantly\r\nput it and I quote, \"This issue is in everybody's backyard\". Caring\r\nwell for our seniors is a collective responsibility we all share.\r\nMany of the aged care facilities will have to be sited within the\r\ncommunity for the convenience of the seniors. On our part, the Government\r\nwill engage advisors, grassroots leaders and residents on our plans\r\nfor facility development and to strike a careful balance between\r\naddressing the needs of the seniors and the needs of the residents\r\nin the vicinity.

In Marine Parade, for example, some 70 seniors participated\r\nin our town audit by walking around the estate at different times\r\nof the day and night, and they surfaced almost 300 suggestions on\r\nhow the built environment could be improved to help seniors move\r\naround more safely and with greater confidence. The Town Council and\r\nLTA responded by fixing many of these hardware issues where practical.\r\nWe also tapped on the many helping hands in Marine Parade. Senior\r\nvolunteers helped us in conducting functional screening of seniors,\r\naged 70 years old and above, in Marine Parade. The local Seniors\r\nActivity Centre, called \"Goodlife\"!, responded to the needs of vulnerable\r\nseniors by visiting those who said they were living alone, and I\r\nknow that some of the local RC chairpersons personally keep in touch\r\nwith these seniors living alone in some of the RC zones. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-53d2bece-8252-41ef-afd4-7cbdab3575e1\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-53d2bece-8252-41ef-afd4-7cbdab3575e1\"><!--a--></a>We intend to foster similar\r\npartnerships in Whampoa, Bedok and Taman Jurong.

Therefore, we need\r\nto help them with this funding. Going forward, the additional wage\r\nincreases will be rolled into the normal wages and these normal\r\nwages will form the normal costing of the hospitals and our institutions. And\r\nthe Government funding will be based on the usual funding framework,\r\nsubvention framework. For hospitals, for example, the funding will\r\nbe based on the class of wards that you are in, and the patients\r\nwill share in the cost.

We estimate maybe between\r\n100 and 150 or thereabouts every year. So we hope to be able to reach out\r\nto more of them, including dentists, and hope that we can bring\r\nback more of these Singaporeans who are studying overseas. We also\r\nhave to be mindful that we could only accept students who are in\r\napproved institutions. Other institutions may not be able to qualify.\r\nAnd in terms of outreach, we organise promotional trips to these countries\r\nwhere many of our Singapore students are. We organise events to\r\nbring them together and explain to them what PEG is about. We also\r\nshare with them what they can do when they come back. And we appeal\r\nto them to consider PEG and come back and serve the Singapore healthcare\r\nsector.

And even as we\r\nlook into the future when we review the MediShield this year, we\r\nalso need to look at the adequacy of the reserves. As we enhance\r\nthe benefits and look at the claim experiences of previous years,\r\nwe will have to decide how much of reserves need to be put aside\r\nfor the coming five-year period. And therefore for every revision\r\nto the premium, we will have to take into account what proportion\r\nof it needs to be put aside for\r\nreserves, partly for the capital adequacy required by MAS and also\r\npartly for the loyalty rebate in future which I explained. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2176</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-85de37b2-8196-455f-a6d3-26ce84487d33\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-85de37b2-8196-455f-a6d3-26ce84487d33\"><!--a--></a>As an individual when\r\nyou are younger, when you are able to earn a regular income, there\r\nis a loading on your premium.

As you get older, you would\r\nappreciate that the number of people shrinks and the claims go up.\r\nAnd, so, as you get older, for the older cohorts, their premiums\r\nare going to be very high and that is why we have this arrangement\r\nfor pre-funding. So, as an individual, you pre-fund yourself; when\r\nyou get older, you then draw on this rebate which comes from the\r\nreserves.

So, all the participants in\r\nMediShield will share the risk of congenital diseases, and this scheme\r\nwill have to be enforced before the child has discovered the illness\r\nso that the congenital disease will be covered.

So, those are the day-care\r\nfacilities.

I\r\nam looking, in particular, to see if MOH is interested to look at\r\nan innovative project where we could probably consider using double-decker\r\nbeds in some of\r\nthe hospital wards currently.

We have talked a little\r\nbit about Parkway. I have not talked about Raffles because the discussion\r\nis still on-going. Even with Parkway, the detailed operational arrangements\r\nare still being worked out but the principle is that, for Parkway,\r\nour own doctors will be manning the beds that we are taking over\r\nfrom Parkway East and, therefore, our doctors would have access\r\nto our own patients' records. But, eventually, the idea is that\r\nthe national electronic healthcare records would include private\r\nhospitals so that we can share patients' records to facilitate the\r\ncare of the patient, because the patient may be in a public hospital\r\ntoday; but tomorrow he may decide, for convenience or whatever reason,\r\nto go to a private hospital. So, we must facilitate that by making\r\nour national electronic healthcare record portable between hospital\r\ninstitutions. For Raffles, the arrangement is still being worked out\r\nand we will announce the details of the arrangement when it is done.\r\nI will leave the other question to the Minister of State.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-00a614e1-6b6c-4934-98e0-816b7b8fa505\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-00a614e1-6b6c-4934-98e0-816b7b8fa505\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-ba5157e6-9774-4078-bc68-a7c7806a6d08\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-ba5157e6-9774-4078-bc68-a7c7806a6d08\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</strong>\r\n                  </span>: The\r\n$20 billion CHIPS fund is earmarked for the ILTC sector but the\r\nproductivity and innovation grant is also available for the healthcare sector\r\nat the macro level.

At the moment, they are allowed to\r\nuse only up to $800, but sometimes they would want to upgrade to\r\na better policy plan and would need more, say, $1,100 or $1,200.\r\nSome of these people may be cash-poor because they are retirees and\r\nthey would like to make full use of their Medisave to buy all this\r\ninsurance.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-37457142-3523-4982-8abb-f05ae2ba79fa\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-37457142-3523-4982-8abb-f05ae2ba79fa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-69ead112-693a-4e6c-93d1-1d6c116968ed\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-69ead112-693a-4e6c-93d1-1d6c116968ed\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I\r\nbelieve flexi-arrangement for nursing is already available. In fact,\r\nmany of our healthcare institutions, whether it is acute hospitals,\r\ncommunity hospitals, ILTC or nursing homes, do practise flexible\r\nhours. But, of course, even with flexi-hours, there has to be some\r\nstructure and some arrangement so that nurses know when they have\r\nto come and institutions know when the nurses would be there so\r\nthat they can arrange the manpower deployment. The flexibility is\r\nthere, and we encourage flexibility because this will allow us to\r\ntap on, say, retired nurses, who may not want to work full-time.\r\nThis is something that is very important for us to help meet our manpower\r\nneeds.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-a4fa0a55-5116-4c26-b732-de1d9bd88fbb\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-a4fa0a55-5116-4c26-b732-de1d9bd88fbb\"><!--a--></a>On upgrading, I am not\r\nvery clear what Mrs Chiam's argument is. She is saying that if we\r\nkeep upgrading the skills of nurses, then they will lose the basic\r\nrole of nursing. We provide opportunities for nurses to upgrade.\r\nWe provide three different pathways: one is continuing with clinical\r\nnursing; the second is for administration and leadership where they\r\nbecome nursing managers to manage a team of nurses; and there is\r\nanother group that will pursue the educational path that will provide\r\neducation and teaching to the next generation of nurses. All three\r\nare very important. We have to make sure that we have enough people to continue\r\nwith clinical practice so that our patients are cared for. At the same\r\ntime, we also need to ensure we have sufficient leaders among the\r\nnurses that will be able to help us in managing nursing. And some\r\nof them will be elevated to advanced practice nurses who will be\r\nable to undertake more complex nursing roles. In fact, in many other\r\ncountries, nurses do a lot more than what we are doing today. So,\r\nwe are continuing to explore ways to enlarge the role of nurses\r\nso as to meet the manpower needs of our healthcare sector. Education\r\nis also very important because if you do not have nurse educators,\r\nyou would not be able to train the next generation of nurses. So, all\r\nthe three groups need to be balanced and calibrated. In our manpower\r\nplan, we have to decide how many practising clinical nurses we need,\r\nhow many educators we need and how many administrators we need,\r\nso that we have a comprehensive manpower plan to develop our nursing\r\ncareers.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2181</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-d31324f3-e58f-46e5-81b3-e6265feea71b\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d31324f3-e58f-46e5-81b3-e6265feea71b\"><!--a--></a>On her last question on\r\nintegrated plans, today, there is a limit on how much an individual\r\ncan draw down to pay for private shield plans. The starting point\r\nis we have to make sure that each individual has sufficient savings\r\nin the Medisave account at least to meet the needs for basic MediShield\r\nand ElderShield premiums. If you allow them to draw more, the risk\r\nis that they may have enough to draw more today for the additional plans,\r\nfor example, the upgraded plans that they want, but they may not\r\nhave enough for next year or five years down the line. So, we have\r\nto think ahead of time. That is why we have a certain limit to allow\r\nthem the flexibility to upgrade if they want to, but we cannot totally\r\nlift the limits because otherwise they may purchase a very attractive\r\nplan today or for the next three years but, after that, they may\r\ndeplete their Medisave and they may not even have enough for the\r\nbasic MediShield. Their MediShield cover may just lapse, and that\r\nis not desirable. We understand the Member's concern and we want to\r\nbe as flexible as we can but, at the same time, we need to balance\r\nit with a need to preserve the savings for their basic healthcare\r\nneeds, especially the basic Shield plans.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-96e235d5-3363-4c16-ab0f-451c6d61accc\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-96e235d5-3363-4c16-ab0f-451c6d61accc\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-58475ce5-d18a-47b1-b56a-d87154b4605a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-58475ce5-d18a-47b1-b56a-d87154b4605a\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Dr Teo Ho Pin</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, I wish\r\nto seek clarification from the Minister with regard to the three\r\nstrategic objectives of Healthcare 2020 \u2013 accessibility, quality\r\nand affordability. When I look at the health clusters, I was looking\r\nat the north, you have Alexandra health cluster; in the west, you\r\nhave Jurong cluster. But I am a little bit concerned for residents in\r\nmy constituency at Bukit Panjang. We are neither in the north nor\r\nin the west.

As\r\nan individual patient, whichever hospital you go to, the hospital\r\nwill look after you. They will not say, \"Well, since you are from\r\nthe east, please go back to the east; if you are from the west, please\r\ngo back to the west.\" So, wherever you are, if you are in an emergency,\r\nthe ambulance will take you to the nearest hospital and they will\r\ntake care of you. What is important in the regional system is that\r\nby the time you are discharged, wherever you are, I am quite sure\r\nyou will go back to your home. Because you work in the west, and something\r\nhappened to you, you go to the western hospital. You live in the\r\neast, so when you are discharged from the western hospital, you\r\nwill go back to stay in the east. And when you go back to the east,\r\nthe eastern health cluster will look after you because you will\r\nbe seeing polyclinics in the east. If you need follow-up with specialists,\r\nyou can follow up\r\nwith the previous hospital or you can follow up with the hospital\r\nwithin your cluster. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2182</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f74844da-0aff-4c44-a763-8e9c840af870\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f74844da-0aff-4c44-a763-8e9c840af870\"><!--a--></a>Once we have the NEHR\r\nfully up, we will be able to communicate between hospitals and the\r\npatient information will then be shared. And wherever you are, you\r\nwill be looked after within the region. The idea of a regional system\r\nis to foster stronger collaboration among the various healthcare\r\ninstitutions in the region so that the hospitals can work with the\r\ncommunity hospital and the nursing home to facilitate patient transfers.\r\nFor nursing home patients, for example, if they need acute hospital care,\r\nthey can then be sent to a hospital in the cluster. They will have\r\nworking arrangements that will facilitate a patient's transfer and\r\nminimise the hassle and administrative procedures. So, when a patient\r\nis discharged and goes home, the polyclinics or the GPs in the cluster\r\nmay look after him in the primary care sector and our community\r\nhealth centres may then be able to provide allied health services\r\nto support him. Our day-care centres will provide the day rehab\r\nto support him. So, it is all within the region. That is the concept\r\nof regional system. It does not preclude individual patients from\r\nany particular hospital. So, your patients do not have to worry,\r\nthey just have to go to the nearest hospital that is convenient\r\nto them, and we will take care of them.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-14b7b199-ae00-4a23-bba2-8d51ebc12aaa\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-14b7b199-ae00-4a23-bba2-8d51ebc12aaa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-6fe80aae-6d50-4869-8c0b-cf574869d760\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-6fe80aae-6d50-4869-8c0b-cf574869d760\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gan Thiam Poh</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nSir, I would like to seek a clarification from the Minister pertaining\r\nto my suggestion earlier on to give free MediShield coverage for\r\nthe low-income group and homemakers.

Not all the 8% are\r\nfrom the low-income group. But for the really low-income and those\r\nwith no income at all, rather than giving them free MediShield insurance,\r\nwe have many other ways to help them. One way is through our Medifund,\r\nthrough subsidies directly from our health institutions, which can\r\nsupport them. Because for this low-income group, or if the whole family\r\nhas no income or are on public assistance, joining an insurance\r\nscheme may not be the most sensible thing for them.

One\r\nof the challenges is that the healthcare system is evolving as we\r\nimplement the National Electronic Health Record system, and the\r\nsystem also has to evolve with the way we structure our healthcare\r\nsector. Therefore, it is quite a complex project. We do it in phases.\r\nAs I mentioned to the Member, for the current phase, we are on target.\r\nBy June this year, we will roll out our programmes. </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-4eda647c-f985-4544-aa9b-dfa1f712ab60\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-4eda647c-f985-4544-aa9b-dfa1f712ab60\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2183</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading hcTime\" id=\"id-b196257f-b803-4360-b606-2fdf3d304f37\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b196257f-b803-4360-b606-2fdf3d304f37\"><!--a--></a>2.30 pm</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7e9ee833-c99c-4795-bb01-478048c62669\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7e9ee833-c99c-4795-bb01-478048c62669\"><!--a--></a>From the individual patient's\r\npoint of view, this project is quite critical for us because it\r\nwould facilitate the flow of information, and this flow of information\r\nwould allow patients to be able to flow between different healthcare\r\nsettings.

We also welcome caregivers who\r\nare not maids but family members to attend our training so that\r\nthey are better prepared to look after their frail and elderly.\r\nIn fact, quite a lot of our participants are family members. Of\r\ncourse, some of them do send their maids to be trained so that they\r\ncan better help the family members look after their loved ones.\r\nWith regard to the compulsory day off, it is more a question for\r\nthe Ministry of Manpower. I understand that family members do have the option\r\nto provide pay <em class=\"ph i\">in lieu</em>. So if there are circumstances requiring\r\nthe maid to be at home to help look after the disabled or those who\r\nare elderly, I think there is flexibility provided.

I am impressed\r\nby the massive expansion plan in the infrastructure for healthcare,\r\nand I understand from the statement yesterday that we will require\r\nabout 20,000 healthcare workers by 2020. Even with the ramping up\r\nof the training for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals,\r\nI believe we would not be able to meet the target just by tapping on\r\nthe local pool. I believe we would probably have to hire from overseas.\r\nCan I just ask the Minister how confident is he in meeting the target\r\nbecause, if not, we would potentially face a manpower crunch when\r\nthe time comes? The two wish lists will be whether the Minister\r\ncan consider removing the minimum age limit for the Community Health\r\nAssist Scheme (CHAS) as well as extending the additional FDW grant\r\nfor ageing at home to families with younger patients with severe\r\ndisabilities that require full-time care by the FDW, if it is not\r\nthis year, maybe hopefully next COS.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-791d6176-30b3-49aa-b887-bac5450530c5\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-791d6176-30b3-49aa-b887-bac5450530c5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-05fc166d-ad1b-4cdf-8b32-a078c8ef03e0\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-05fc166d-ad1b-4cdf-8b32-a078c8ef03e0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Gan Kim Yong</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Sir, the\r\nshort answer to the first question is that we must meet the target.\r\nBut I think we are confident. We have looked at our pipeline. We\r\nhave looked at the potential source of manpower \u2212 locally trained\r\nas well as Singaporeans who are now overseas and foreign manpower.\r\nWe have to work together, both local and foreigners here and overseas,\r\nto come together to deliver healthcare services for Singaporeans.\r\nOn the two wish lists, the minimum age of CHAS: we have just lowered it\r\nfrom 65 to 40. We have just barely started implementing it. We register\r\nDr Lam's persistent request and it is duly noted. We would take\r\na look and see whether it is necessary for us to lower it further.\r\nIf Members remember, the main purpose of CHAS was to look after\r\nthe chronic diseases\r\nin the community. From our studies, this is more critical for those\r\nwho are 40 and above. We will continue to review to see whether\r\nthere is need to lower it. On the FDW grant, again, that is more\r\na MOM cut. But I think we will register his request and we will\r\nreview it in due course.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2a21012e-6c27-4234-9431-c34d57cf685d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-2a21012e-6c27-4234-9431-c34d57cf685d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2185</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-b97c60ea-3b09-430d-81e3-95e8961b0fac\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-b97c60ea-3b09-430d-81e3-95e8961b0fac\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">The Chairman</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mrs Lina Chiam,\r\nyou have the last clarification, please.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-471fe10a-efd5-4293-854d-4eb0c09d799d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-471fe10a-efd5-4293-854d-4eb0c09d799d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-8fd01258-bc91-4d67-8c9e-09dfe1b4091d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-8fd01258-bc91-4d67-8c9e-09dfe1b4091d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mrs Lina Chiam</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Thank you.\r\nA clarification on the point I made on the role of nursing.

One of them is for nurses to\r\nremain in the nursing practice, clinical nursing where the nurses\r\nwill continue to be nurses. They are not educators. They are not\r\nadministrators. They will remain as nurses. So, the nurses on this\r\nnursing track will continue to look after the patients. Even administrators\r\nwill continue to look after patients, although they have a special\r\nfocus on administration and leadership. Even nurse educators also\r\npractise.

What is the timeline for MOT to ramp up service\r\nimprovement and enhance our public transport? If the implementation\r\nis executed well, then this funding should further improve our land\r\ntransport. This will likely persuade more Singaporeans to take buses and\r\nincrease bus operators' revenues. How will MOT then ensure that\r\nthe profitability enjoyed by public transport operators (PTOs) as\r\na result of this funding will be returned to the Government? Did\r\nMOT clarify how will such funding bring benefits to Singaporeans\r\nin the near term? How does MOT hold PTOs accountable to the good deployment\r\nof the 550 new buses for the purpose of shortening waiting time,\r\nreducing overcrowding, better accessibility and connectivity with\r\nbetter routes with feeder buses? Does MOT specify guidelines to\r\nensure that the new buses are not being used to ease PTOs' day-to-day\r\nresponsibilities or their bottom lines at the expense of vast optimal outcomes?\r\nHow does MOT plan to monitor subsequently as PTOs are private entities and\r\nnot under the Government's jurisdiction but receiving Government\r\nfunding and an almost\r\nmonopoly right? For example, how does MOT ensure that the PTOs are\r\nlean and productive? How much do the PTOs pay their top management?\r\nIt was reported that SMRT paid its past CEO, Saw Phaik Hwa, a remuneration\r\nof more than $1.6 million in 2010. May I ask MOT, should the PTOs\r\nbe not profitable despite this latest $1.1 billion funding due to\r\nhigh remuneration for staff and for inefficiency, are they allowed\r\nto resort to hiking transport fares for more profit? </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2190</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-48cfd72c-d2fc-40c2-af38-239bb6fdb75d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-48cfd72c-d2fc-40c2-af38-239bb6fdb75d\"><!--a--></a>In Australia and Britain,\r\ntheir governments give to successful bidders to run bus systems\r\nand pay them for their services in a hybrid system.

In June last year, LTA announced that it would embark\r\non a noise measurement study to be completed by the second quarter\r\nof this year. The study will span an entire length of elevated tracks\r\nisland-wide and cover more than 500 flats located near to these\r\nelevated viaducts. The objective is to identify locations which\r\nrequire special attention. Currently, LTA has installed low noise\r\nbarriers at the new viaduct and platform at Jurong East Station\r\nto reduce the noise to the same level before the implementation\r\nof Jurong East Modification Project.

We opened the last stretch of the Circle Line,\r\nfrom Marymount to Harbourfront, in October 2011, and this brought\r\nincreased convenience and enhanced connectivity to many commuters.\r\nBecause it is an orbital line linking all the main lines, the Circle\r\nLine helped to reduce crowding on existing lines, especially the city-bound\r\nstretches in the morning. For instance, the morning peak loading\r\nlevels have decreased by about 5%-10% between Serangoon and Little\r\nIndia, and about 3%-5% between Bishan and Novena. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-2cda78db-daf6-4c74-a5fd-13a7a950e0ea\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-2cda78db-daf6-4c74-a5fd-13a7a950e0ea\"><!--a--></a>The Circle Line also connects\r\na range of destinations that were previously not served by rail,\r\nsuch as the NUH, the cluster of R&amp;D hubs at One-North, attractions\r\nlike Holland Village, the Botanic Gardens and Haw Par Villa.

Our funding for the 550 buses will not result\r\nin a profit for the operators. We will pay the operating costs of\r\nthese buses and will recover the revenue derived from operating\r\nthem. The $1.1 billion is a budgeted figure, and we will release\r\nfunds to the PTOs at a pace commensurate with their incurred expenditures\r\nfrom running the programme. And in return, the PTOs will be required\r\nto deliver the agreed service level improvements. The LTA will track\r\nand monitor their performance, and work closely with them to ensure\r\nthat the resources provided translate into the intended outcomes\r\nto benefit commuters. As an additional safeguard, the LTA will scrutinise\r\nthe PTOs' actual costs for the purchase and running of the buses, bearing\r\nin mind that they still have to operate and run efficiently the\r\n4,250 buses that they have to pay for themselves. And should their\r\ncosts turn out to be lower than expected, our Government funding\r\nwill be reduced correspondingly. So, one way or another, there is\r\nno profit to be made from the funding that we will provide for these\r\n550 buses under this enhancement programme.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-fb36447d-956d-4127-9baf-91fea4f594fd\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-fb36447d-956d-4127-9baf-91fea4f594fd\"><!--a--></a>Without Government funding,\r\nthe bus companies would not be able to step up capacity and service\r\nlevels so quickly.

From 2006\r\nto 2011, public transport fares went up by a total of 0.3%. During\r\nthat same period, fuel prices went up by about 34%, while national\r\nwages increased by about 26%. As Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam\r\nsaid in his Budget Round-Up Speech, it would not be viable for the PTOs\r\nto bear the additional costs of the 550 buses using their own financial\r\nresources, unless fares were sharply increased by about 15 cents.\r\nTherefore, the $1.1 billion that the Government is putting into\r\nthis programme is, in reality, a subsidy to benefit public transport\r\ncommuters so that they enjoy a higher level of service.

And the other\r\nis whether the operators should be state-owned non-profit entities\r\nor commercially-oriented companies. I think I have dealt with the\r\nfirst issue earlier.

The\r\nprofit incentive drives the operators towards higher efficiency\r\nand productivity, which keeps costs as low as possible. These productivity\r\ngains and cost savings are then passed on to commuters in the form\r\nof lower fare increases, as we have seen in our system. Otherwise,\r\nif the system is inefficiently-run, the public will ultimately pay\r\nfor the higher operating costs, either through higher fares, or\r\ngreater Government subsidies. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-984d006d-64ff-4385-ae59-9dbc62c66823\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-984d006d-64ff-4385-ae59-9dbc62c66823\"><!--a--></a>If we look at comparable\r\nexamples around the world, we find that, in general, the most efficiently-run\r\npublic transport services are provided by commercially-driven entities,\r\nsuch as the MTR in Hong Kong. And, increasingly, cities like Melbourne\r\nhave also privatised their public transport industry to improve\r\nefficiency and productivity. The advantage of privatisation is actually\r\nwell documented in the experience of London Buses. Let me share\r\nthis with Members. London Buses was privatised in 1985. Between 1985\r\nand 1996, the price per vehicle kilometre dropped 45%, while costs\r\nper passenger trip fell by nearly a third. This is even as ridership\r\nand reliability of the system both increased. Private contracting\r\nled to lower costs and about 10 years on from when the bus reforms\r\nwere first introduced in 1985, London saw a 70% decrease in subsidies. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-13edef37-3d09-4876-bcc6-1d3cf452ca8d\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-13edef37-3d09-4876-bcc6-1d3cf452ca8d\"><!--a--></a>Even as we use commercial\r\nentities to run operations, it is important for Government to take\r\ncontrol in key areas \u2013 to plan for rail lines and bus routes, to\r\nensure a firm regulatory mechanism for fares, to specify service\r\nlevels for rail and bus service, and to decide on timely capacity\r\ninjection to meet ridership growth. We amended the Road Traffic\r\nAct in 2010, passed it in Parliament, to implement a new rail financing\r\nframework. Previously, the Government undertook the planning and\r\ndevelopment of our rail network, while the operator owned and operated\r\nrail operating assets. One of the key features of the new rail framework\r\nis that the Government will take over the ownership of operating\r\nassets and make the decisions on the timing of asset procurement\r\nand capacity enhancement. This enables us to ensure that sufficient\r\ncapacity is brought in to meet projected ridership growth in a timely\r\nfashion.

Imagine if they had taken the MRT or\r\nbuses instead! In addition, there are always the occasions of personal\r\nand family emergencies where taxi services are indispensable. Without\r\na doubt, taxis are an important component in our public transport\r\nsystem, providing an essential service to the public which buses\r\nand the MRT cannot. If taxi drivers are properly trained and monitored,\r\nas a group, they can help improve our driving culture and road safety,\r\ngoals which are difficult to achieve with individual drivers.

First, utilisation of taxi vehicles. Mr Chairman, the taxi industry\r\nwas liberalised in 2004. And since then, the number of registered\r\ntaxis on the road has increased from about 20,000 plus to the current\r\n27,000. So, over the last eight years,\r\nwe have seen the increase of about 7,000 taxis on the road. It is\r\nestimated that about 30% of the 27,000 taxis are operating on one-man\r\noperation (OMO). This means that the current fleet of taxis is under-utilised\r\nto serve the commuting needs of the public. So, we should review\r\nthe statutory obligation of the taxi companies; shift the focus\r\nfrom hiring out their taxis to one that they need to ensure full\r\nutilisation of every taxi they hire out. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2210</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7d7d3f30-c3e2-41f4-a18e-de7f14579b3a\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7d7d3f30-c3e2-41f4-a18e-de7f14579b3a\"><!--a--></a>To support this enhanced\r\nstatutory obligation of taxi companies, I urge the Government to\r\nprovide strong incentives to help taxi companies have the necessary capability\r\nto monitor who are driving their taxis and how their fleet of taxis\r\nare utilised. We should have a comprehensive system to match reliable\r\nrelief taxi drivers to their principal hirers. This way, I believe,\r\nmost one-man operated (OMO) taxis hirers would welcome it as they\r\nwould find it easier to find suitable relief drivers to lighten\r\nthe burden of their daily operating cost. More fully utilised taxis\r\nwould also mean that the supply of taxi service would be higher\r\nthroughout the day to fulfil the demand for taxi service, without\r\nthe need to put more taxis on the roads. By making taxi companies\r\nmore productive in supplying taxi service, it would benefit both\r\nthe taxi drivers and the public commuters.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-703ee600-ba57-4621-8a81-d9f077a7249d\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-703ee600-ba57-4621-8a81-d9f077a7249d\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcHeading\" id=\"id-d6b045c6-c2f1-41fe-a077-8c12e7ae3990\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-d6b045c6-c2f1-41fe-a077-8c12e7ae3990\"><!--a--></a>Special Tax for Euro V\r\nCars</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-422e3680-f634-4c8f-99b9-0abf92cd33d5\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-422e3680-f634-4c8f-99b9-0abf92cd33d5\"><!--a--></a>Next, Sir, special tax\r\nfor Euro V cars.

Overall, ERP\r\nhas been a useful tool in managing traffic congestion. We are, however,\r\nprepared to fine-tune the system where there is room to do so. Members\r\nmay recall that LTA announced several such adjustments in late 2011.\r\nThese include the shortening of the evening ERP operating hours\r\nof the gantries along the northbound CTE and southbound Singapore\r\nRiver Line. The Nicoll Highway gantry, which forms part of the Bugis-Marina\r\nCentre cordon, will also be relocated later this year. Thereafter,\r\nmotorists will be able to access the East Coast Parkway and route\r\nback to Shenton Way if they wish without paying ERP charges on Saturdays,\r\nwhile those who enter the Bugis-Marina Centre cordon will continue\r\nto pay ERP. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f74e8970-9129-4d34-9b9b-4ca6cf9b7438\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f74e8970-9129-4d34-9b9b-4ca6cf9b7438\"><!--a--></a>The effect on traffic\r\npatterns is a key factor in making any adjustments. In the case\r\nof the CTE, we observed heavier traffic flow after 8 pm, which is\r\nthe new ERP cut-off time. Fortunately, the recent widening of the\r\nCTE has helped to moderate the impact of increased traffic on travel\r\nspeeds. However, there is very limited scope to widen roads in the\r\ncity centre. Any surge in traffic volumes would significantly impact\r\ntravel speeds. This is why we have adopted the cordon concept for\r\nthe CBD area, as there is only so much traffic that we can tolerate\r\nwithin the CBD if we want to keep it relatively free of congestion.\r\nThis applies also to Saturdays and let me explain why. Leaving one\r\nroad leading to the cordon that we are interested in unpriced would\r\nsimply lead to a surge in traffic entering the cordoned area and\r\ncreating congestion within, for example, the Bugis area. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2219</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-c6345829-8a1b-481f-b3a8-a7b10bb397db\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-c6345829-8a1b-481f-b3a8-a7b10bb397db\"><!--a--></a>Orchard Road is used by two groups of\r\ncommuters.

We are referring to diesel cars. The Euro\r\nV diesel cars have significantly lower PM emissions, comparable\r\nto petrol cars. And therefore, we decided to reduce the special\r\ntax for Euro V diesel cars so that it is roughly equivalent to the\r\nannual fuel tax paid by an equivalent petrol car. However, the treatment\r\nthat we are now according to Euro V diesel cars is the treatment\r\nthat we have given to taxis all these years; because the taxis have\r\na much higher mileage, approximately averaging 150,000 km per year\r\nwhen we looked at it then. We set the special tax for the taxis\r\nat $5,100, which actually is a slight discount from what it would\r\nbe if we had set it at full level, but that is how we arrived at\r\nthe scheme for the taxis similar to what we are adopting for the\r\nEuro V diesel cars today. And that is why we did not make any change\r\nto the special tax for taxis. So, the current special tax rate of $5,100 for taxis\r\nis simply the equivalent of the petrol tax payable for the high\r\nannual mileage that taxis chalk up. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"column\">Page: 2224</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-43dae830-048b-44fe-9fc9-afcf74eb8035\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-43dae830-048b-44fe-9fc9-afcf74eb8035\"><!--a--></a>Mr Seng also suggested\r\nthat LTA consider further easing the CBD Taxi Rule restriction hours.\r\nIn response to the feedback from the National Taxi Association,\r\nwe had further shortened the restriction hours to align them with\r\nthe operating hours for full day bus lanes and we removed the Vocational\r\nLicence Points System demerit points for violations from 1 March\r\n2012.

In addition, 1.87 million tonnes of cargo\r\nwere handled in 2011, an increase of 2.8% over the previous year.\r\nChangi Airport is now the seventh busiest international airport\r\nin the world and serves more than 100 international airlines flying\r\nto 210 cities worldwide.

Crucially, this might be\r\none of the last glimpses of Singapore a visitor might experience; and\r\nit is not a great way for one to end a visit here. I would be grateful\r\nif the Minister could\r\nlet us know if there has, indeed, over the years been an increase\r\nin air traffic control delays at Changi Airport. And, if there have\r\nbeen such delays caused by air traffic congestion, what steps are\r\nbeing taken to reduce these delays?

This is quite an\r\naccomplishment, especially when our harbour-craft fleet only comprises\r\n300 tug boats and 270 bunker tankers to escort vessel arrivals and\r\nrefuel them in Singapore's port waters and anchorages. On a daily\r\nbasis, they service more than 1,000 vessels in our port, playing\r\na vital role in bringing economic benefits, while ensuring maritime safety\r\nin our waters. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7fbf3d9f-1900-4cc0-a258-3b5b35131699\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7fbf3d9f-1900-4cc0-a258-3b5b35131699\"><!--a--></a>The bulk of the harbour-craft\r\ncrew are trained foreign seafarers who have undergone years of training\r\nto carry out complex shipping operations on our tug boats and bunker tankers.\r\nThis training is in line with international best practices and cannot\r\nbe reduced without\r\ncompromising safety standards.

On the point of public transport fare structure, the Minister\r\nmentioned that between 2006 and 2011, the public transport fares\r\nactually only rose by 0.3%, cumulatively. That is correct. So, it\r\nis not annually but cumulatively \u2212 only 0.3%, whereas fuel and wages\r\nrose by 20-odd percent or 30-odd percent. I think that presupposes\r\nthat the starting point in 2006, the returns with which PTOs were\r\nenjoying at 2006 was a fair and risk commensurate one. It is only\r\nif you start from that position can you then say that because revenue\r\nrises more slowly than costs, the PTOs have to be compensated. But\r\nI checked the numbers. I think in 2006, the two public transport\r\noperators' return on invested capital was about 12% to 15%. And\r\neven in 2011, after the fact that revenue has risen more slowly\r\nthan their costs of operations, their returns, in my view, are still\r\nfair and reasonable. I would like to ask the Minister what, in his\r\nview, is a fair return for companies like these, and what kind of\r\nlevels of returns would be considered reasonable?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-16593815-7802-4f9c-aba4-e8edee6a61a5\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-16593815-7802-4f9c-aba4-e8edee6a61a5\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-4b91414f-a3f1-4c2f-8bda-4b463e076097\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-4b91414f-a3f1-4c2f-8bda-4b463e076097\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>\r\n                  </span>: Mr Chairman,\r\nI thank Mr Cedric Foo for the clarification.

Part of the reason for this is\r\nbecause of the way we have structured rail financing in the past,\r\nwhich allows the companies to operate assets and derive revenue\r\nfrom these assets, without them being on their books, meaning that\r\nthey remain on the books of the LTA.

I\r\ndo appreciate the work of the Ministries and the agencies. I think\r\nSingapore is one of the most amenable cities to cycling but I am\r\nin the minority in that view. With respect to the studies that he\r\nquoted about the safety issues with cycling lanes, I wonder if there\r\nis some confusion about what I am suggesting. My understanding from\r\nthe examples cited was that those were studies where there is a\r\nseparation of traffic, so there is a specific cycling lane and a\r\nspecific car lane which leads to this false sense of security because the\r\ncar can swerve one way and the cyclist can swerve another way. That\r\nis not what I am suggesting. I am suggesting measures to help people\r\nshare the existing lanes better and so the false sense of security\r\nshould not happen.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-12781c65-05e3-45f5-a9e8-4cc0c9d678e2\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-12781c65-05e3-45f5-a9e8-4cc0c9d678e2\"><!--a--></a>The other reason for potential\r\ndecrease in safety in the studies, if these studies are right that\r\nI believe he cited, where there are separated lanes, is the Bernoulli\r\nprinciple where a very rapidly moving vehicle causes a pressure\r\nwave which can unbalance the cyclist. So that again, it only happens\r\nwhere you have a separation of flow because the traffic in the right-hand\r\nlane continues at high speed and the cyclist is affected. That is not\r\nwhat I am suggesting because here the cyclists have to be overtaken\r\nby the car and so, in this case, any change in safety from the Bernoulli\r\neffect would actually be improved by the increased clearance.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"section hcSection hcSpeech\" id=\"id-2310d3fa-4b8b-4182-9d7c-cbc706d0c4f0\">\r\n               <a name=\"budget__id-2310d3fa-4b8b-4182-9d7c-cbc706d0c4f0\"><!--a--></a>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-7335c654-f849-4fa4-8ff9-dee7a4faa0aa\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-7335c654-f849-4fa4-8ff9-dee7a4faa0aa\"><!--a--></a>\r\n                  <span class=\"ph hcInline hcMember\">\r\n                     <strong class=\"ph b\">Mr Lui Tuck Yew</strong>\r\n                  </span>: I thank\r\nDr Janil for that clarification. Indeed, we are talking about markings\r\non the lanes rather than a segregated lane. Those studies in the\r\n1980s, and which we are very happy to share with the Member, referred\r\nto what has been done in European cities where they actually mark\r\nout a line, a visual guide on the same road space rather than segregated\r\nlane. I found it very interesting that the accident rates went up\r\nso I asked LTA to further explain this to me. One of the reasons,\r\nin fact, I think that the studies themselves cited was that, there\r\nwas what they thought the complacency factor. Today, you will find\r\nthat by and large, motorists do give quite a wide berth to the cyclists.\r\nAs wide a berth as we can. With a visual marking, one may think\r\nthat as long as I keep to that visual marking, I have given 1.5\r\nmetres and I have done what is necessary. For experienced cyclists,\r\nthat 1.5 metres may well be sufficient. But where you have somebody\r\nwho is relatively inexperienced and wobbles a little bit, actually\r\nit might end up a little bit more dangerous. So, that is part of\r\nwhat they explained to me: why in the European experiments, it actually\r\nresulted in more accidents. We will be happy to share some of that\r\nwith the Member and to see what we can do further together. </p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-f4c54357-3f1f-480c-92cc-33576d6207f9\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-f4c54357-3f1f-480c-92cc-33576d6207f9\"><!--a--></a>On motorcycles, we will\r\nthink about this, going forward, just as we do for commercial vehicles\r\nand so on.

For the programme that we talk about\r\nunder the BSEP, basically, it is going to be over the next five\r\nyears, doing what the operators did in 20 years. So, we compressed\r\nthat into a five-year programme \u2013 800 buses. There are competing\r\npriorities: one, the existing routes that we need to improve. Routes\r\nparallel to the MRT lines that people have been asking for, and which\r\nwe will do during the morning peaks, as well as the other new routes\r\nthat I mentioned. Seventy percent of those buses are going to be\r\nbrought in within the next three years, by end 2014. So, 70% of\r\nwhat we hope to do is going to be done within the next three years.\r\nThe priority is to improve the existing routes, feeders as well\r\nas trunks, what I have talked about. It does not mean that we are\r\nneglecting the new routes, they will be done, but they are also\r\ngoing to be progressively rolled out over five years. I know more\r\nMembers will lobby me even harder; it has already begun. I will\r\nlisten to you but, as I mentioned, it has got to be phased in over\r\ntime.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-550b5077-5886-4630-ba86-5a38e383cd33\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-550b5077-5886-4630-ba86-5a38e383cd33\"><!--a--></a>On the 550 buses, we studied\r\nwhat were the other options, including whether a third operator\r\ncould be brought in to do this. The challenge is such and let me\r\nexplain it. We have 300 buses that are going to augment the existing\r\nroutes, better frequencies, more capacity and so on. We have 260\r\nroutes today. We believe that about half of them will require augmentation\r\nin one form or another. So, you are essentially adding, maybe, a couple\r\nof buses to each route to complement what the operators are themselves\r\nputting in today. It is actually very difficult for a new operator\r\nto come in and try to merge the one or two additional buses for\r\neach route with what the current operators are doing. It is very\r\ndifficult. And so those buses, you really have to pass them on to\r\nthe current operators, SMRT and SBST, to bring about improvements\r\nin the bus services.</p>\r\n               <p class=\"p hcParagraph\" id=\"id-da1fbde2-7344-479c-8fb0-103701a42018\">\r\n                  <a name=\"budget__id-da1fbde2-7344-479c-8fb0-103701a42018\"><!--a--></a>For the other 250 buses\r\nthat will go towards serving the new routes, these will be geographically\r\ndispersed because there are needs in many areas. There are 87 of\r\nyou here, and all of you would want to try and ask for something\r\nfor your own constituencies and GRCs, and I see that, too. This\r\nmeans that you have 250 buses that are geographically dispersed\r\nthroughout the country, in all likelihood. The difficulty is what do\r\nyou do for the depots and parking? If you disperse them, it means\r\nthat your overheads of running multiple depots and bus parks are\r\ngoing to be high. If you concentrate it, it means that you have\r\na lot of dead mileage because you have got to deploy the buses to\r\nthe start points and bring them back.

And that is\r\nquite different from what we have done in the Jurong East Modification\r\nProgramme where the sound barriers are just by the side of the track\r\nas well as at Bishan Station where it is a portal that is coming\r\nout from the underground into the open and there is a trumpeting\r\neffect.
