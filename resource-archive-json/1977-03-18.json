Where  a  change of use is  involved,  it  is\r\n\r\nnormally given to an existing user. But I do not know\r\n\r\nin what context the Member for Thomson is speaking. I\r\n\r\nthink  what he is implying is that certain  types  of\r\n\r\nindustries  are carried out in places  like  chicken-huts, pigsties and dwelling-houses, and whether  they\r\n\r\ncan   continue.  That  is  definitely  not  in  order\r\n\r\nbecause, as I have mentioned, the most\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nimportant factor is the zoning requirements.  I  have\r\n\r\nmentioned  the  precedent that will be  created  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  it  would be impossible to control,  say,\r\n\r\nother  types  of housing whose occupants  would  also\r\n\r\nwant,  for  one reason or another, a change  of  use.\r\n\r\nSir,  the  merits  of  each  case  will  have  to  be\r\n\r\nseriously considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is just a minor requirement, approval may be\r\n\r\ngiven. For example, previously we have discussed the\r\n\r\nsituation where if a woman uses her dwelling house to\r\n\r\nmake dresses and she owns two sewing machines, on\r\n\r\nthat basis if she has been told that there is a\r\n\r\nchange of use of the place then, of course,\r\n\r\ndiscretion has got to be exercised. She can argue her\r\n\r\ncase out and say that it is probably not a change of\r\n\r\nuse. But where a person wants a permit for a change\r\n\r\nof use to enable him to undertake certain cottage\r\n\r\nindustries, I think, on grounds of planning approval,\r\n\r\nit is not in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am\r\n\r\nnot sure whether the Senior Minister of State is\r\n\r\naware that the zoning criterion has been relied upon\r\n\r\nrather inflexibly by his Department. I have a recent\r\n\r\ncase where a person was doing business frying kropok\r\n\r\nin his house. This was considered by the Department\r\n\r\nto be an industry, and he was given notice to stop\r\n\r\ndoing it,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from the Planning\r\n\r\nDepartment's  point  of view,  zoning  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nnecessary if we really want to prevent indiscriminate\r\n\r\ntypes  of activities going on in any particular area.\r\n\r\nAs  I have stated in the example which the Member for\r\n\r\nJalan Kayu has mentioned, perhaps discretion could be\r\n\r\nexercised  here. I share his sentiment  that  if  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  is  not  intensive the  Planning  Authority\r\n\r\ncould have exercised some flexibility here. But  from\r\n\r\nthe  general overall Master Planning point  of  view,\r\n\r\nzoning is important. If we want to control the proper\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  activities, then  it  is  absolutely\r\n\r\nclear  that there should be no compromise. But  I  do\r\n\r\nconcede that flexibility could be exercised in cases\r\n\r\nof that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether\r\n\r\nthe Senior Minister of State would consider providing\r\n\r\ncertain  flexibility in certain zones. For  instance,\r\n\r\nin  an  Agricultural  zone, you  might  provide  that\r\n\r\ncertain clean industries may be permitted. The zoning\r\n\r\nof areas was done quite a few years back and I do not\r\n\r\nthink it has been reviewed for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard to\r\n\r\nthe  overall  Master Plan, it is agreed that  it  was\r\n\r\ndone many years ago. But although we are supposed  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  the  Master Plan every  five  years,  I  can\r\n\r\nassure  the  Member that it is being  upgraded  on  a\r\n\r\nperiodical  basis, perhaps on an annual or  bi-ennial\r\n\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his suggestion of an adjustment to a\r\n\r\nparticular zone, that is being done. For example,  in\r\n\r\nthe   Agricultural   zone,   we   have   specifically\r\n\r\nintroduced  what  is called a rural centre  zone,  in\r\n\r\nareas  such  as Jalan Kayu and Punggol. The  idea  of\r\n\r\nintroducing  a  rural centre area is to  ensure  that\r\n\r\ncertain  activities, like shopping  or  perhaps  even\r\n\r\nsome  form  of light industries, could be undertaken.\r\n\r\nWe also do allow in between the zones what we call  a\r\n\r\n\"mixed zone\". In fact, we do allow in the Mixed zone,\r\n\r\nhousing and light industries to be mixed together. We\r\n\r\nalso  allow specifically obnoxious industries  to  be\r\n\r\nlocated in certain areas where such activities  could\r\n\r\nbe  carried  out. In other words, I  am  saying  that\r\n\r\nalthough the overall zoning policy is being followed,\r\n\r\nwherever  necessary, modifications are  made  to  the\r\n\r\nMaster Plan to incorporate ideas of that nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LOADING AND UNLOADING OF GOODS FROM VEHICLES</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Relaxation of restriction)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for National\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Communications, in view of the ease\r\n\r\nof traffic on the roads within the Central Business\r\n\r\nDistrict between the hours of 7.30 a.m. and 10.15 a.m.,\r\n\r\nwhether he will consider allowing the loading and\r\n\r\nunloading of goods to be carried out in places where\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  have  been  prohibited,  for  instance,  North\r\n\r\nBridge Road and Victoria Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nprohibition  of loading and unloading of  goods  from\r\n\r\nvehicles  parked  at  the side of  certain  roads  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  because  of  a  number  of  factors,   for\r\n\r\nexample, traffic conditions, physical terrain and the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of the road and the need to facilitate  the\r\n\r\nflow of public transport vehicles.

Grove Road and the area referred to formed part\r\n\r\nof  the  Grove Estate. I do not know where  the  word\r\n\r\n\"Grove\"  came  from,  probably from  \"mangrove\".  The\r\n\r\nMember should also be well aware that one-quarter  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   island   is  swampy.   Hence   the   many\r\n\r\nreclamations which have taken place; the  outstanding\r\n\r\none  being Jurong which was previously one big  large\r\n\r\nswamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member has pointed out, the area he referred\r\n\r\nto  is  very well developed. In fact, the floods  are\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by tidal gates at the Geylang River.  But\r\n\r\nthat  is all we can do.

During the last few months the  ISD  has\r\n\r\nbeen doing an excellent job in actively tracking down\r\n\r\nand   exposing   many  communists  and  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements  in  our  midst.

Many Members\r\n\r\nhave  already  spoken  about  the  drug  problem  the\r\n\r\ntrafficking  and  consumption of drugs  in  Singapore\r\n\r\nduring  the last decade. Yesterday a man died because\r\n\r\nof  drug  addiction.  Even our  laws  too  have  been\r\n\r\nrevised and the death penalty has been introduced for\r\n\r\ndrug  offences.  Though the death  penalty  has  been\r\n\r\nintroduced, yet we do not see any appreciable decline\r\n\r\nin  the  trafficking of drugs. We have already  heard\r\n\r\nthat  about 10 persons have been sentenced  to  death\r\n\r\nand  about  30  others are still  awaiting  trial.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  what  the  authorities are doing  to  further\r\n\r\nstamp this menace of drug trafficking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to solve the prevalent drug problem is to\r\n\r\nstringently  control  the  entry  and  departure   of\r\n\r\nforeigners.  At present, foreigners can  easily  stay\r\n\r\nbehind   after   the  stipulated  time   and   escape\r\n\r\ndetection.  Why  not  introduce entry  control  cards\r\n\r\nwhich could be used to detect anyone overstaying  his\r\n\r\nvisit?  Perhaps  peddlers and drug dealers  could  be\r\n\r\ndealt  a  severe blow if the entry of foreigners  was\r\n\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for drug abusers, what action is being taken\r\n\r\nagainst  them and what rehabilitation is being  given\r\n\r\nto  them? I understand that many young boys and girls\r\n\r\nwho   indulge   in  drugs  are  not  being   properly\r\n\r\nrehabilitated in the detention camps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite often, after their release they commit the\r\n\r\nsame   offence  and  have  to  go  back   again   for\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.   There  seems  to   be   no   proper\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of these young drug addicts to give up\r\n\r\nthe habit of taking drugs. Why is this so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister comment on this matter?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong is not speaking.

I  wish  to  thank him  for  his  word  of\r\n\r\nappreciation.  I  am sure the ISD officers  concerned\r\n\r\nwho   had  worked  very  hard  would  be  very   much\r\n\r\nencouraged,  particularly when it is not  very  often\r\n\r\nthat  the Member for Anson gives bouquets in a debate\r\n\r\nin the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, to his suggestion that the\r\n\r\nISD  should  be  expanded  to  thoroughly  check  all\r\n\r\nGovernment   departments,   schools   and    tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions because \"at the moment we  do  not  know\r\n\r\nwho is who\", I would like to point out the difference\r\n\r\nbetween just identifying a person\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  identifying a communist or anti-national element\r\n\r\nin  our  midst.  The  Police or the  ISD  has  little\r\n\r\ndifficulty  in  identifying persons through  identity\r\n\r\ncards,   passports,  finger  prints, etc.   However,\r\n\r\nidentifying a person who is a communist or  an  anti-national   element  is  quite  a  different   matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, these elements do not operate openly but  in\r\n\r\na  clandestine manner. They go about their subversive\r\n\r\nactivities  by  hiding  their  real  intentions   and\r\n\r\nobjectives.   When   confronted,   they   will    not\r\n\r\nvoluntarily own up their involvement unless  the  ISD\r\n\r\nknows  of  their involvement and is able to  confront\r\n\r\nthem with evidence. Secondly, the ISD would require a\r\n\r\nvery  large pool of manpower to keep a watch on  each\r\n\r\nand  everyone in Government departments,  schools  or\r\n\r\ntertiary  institutions in order to identify  who  are\r\n\r\ncommunists  and anti-national elements  and  who  are\r\n\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it will not be cost-effective and in most cases\r\n\r\nthe checking will be a waste of effort and might even\r\n\r\nresult  in  undue  inconvenience  and  embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThis,  of course, is not desirable. The ISD has  been\r\n\r\nable   to   identify  communists  and   anti-national\r\n\r\nelements   in   these   organisations   through   its\r\n\r\nintelligence  work.  Intelligence  is  also  gathered\r\n\r\nlargely    from    painstaking   investigation    and\r\n\r\ninterrogation  of detainees. For this  work  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat the ISD need more staff. In fact, the department\r\n\r\nis  still  in  the midst of correspondence  with  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance to get more staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with regard to the other points on drug\r\n\r\nconsumption and rehabilitation, I shall reply to them\r\n\r\nwhen  the various subheads pertaining to the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics Bureau are raised for discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The project is still\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelatively  embryonic in relation to  what  it  could\r\n\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one suggestion, however, which\r\n\r\nI  hope  will  help the project avoid an  unnecessary\r\n\r\npitfall.  This  is in connection with  the  project's\r\n\r\nefforts  at forming neighbourhood committees.  May  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that such committees be formed  through  the\r\n\r\nCCC  as  sub-committees  of the  CCC  and  that  good\r\n\r\nliaison  be  maintained with the Member of Parliament\r\n\r\nof the constituency concerned. This could well result\r\n\r\nin  a  pooling of resources and in such collaboration\r\n\r\nthat would help further in the project's aim, because\r\n\r\nthe  proliferation of committees in housing  estates,\r\n\r\nconstituencies,  may  well add to  the  confusion  of\r\n\r\naims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nin  recent years after a restructuring of the  Police\r\n\r\nForce,   there  has  been  an  improvement   in   the\r\n\r\nadministration  of  the Police  Force,  resulting  in\r\n\r\ngreater  peace  and  order in our  society.  However,\r\n\r\nthere  are  still some shortcomings with  the  Police\r\n\r\nForce. According to complaints I have received,  some\r\n\r\npeople  had  occasion to make a report  at  a  police\r\n\r\nstation, but the policemen were not prepared to  take\r\n\r\ntheir report saying that the Inspector in charge  was\r\n\r\nnot  in. So they had to wait until his return.  After\r\n\r\nabout  four hours of waiting, the Inspector in charge\r\n\r\nof  the  station did not return. So the  complainants\r\n\r\nhad  wasted their time. I then enquired of the Police\r\n\r\nDepartment whether it was necessary to report only to\r\n\r\nan  Inspector or a station head. The reply was,  \"No.\r\n\r\nAny  ordinary police officer on duty can take down  a\r\n\r\ncomplaint.\"  This shows the policemen at  the  police\r\n\r\nstation  quoted  above had not performed  their  duty\r\n\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also received complaints that certain traffic\r\n\r\npolicemen have abused their power by booking  drivers\r\n\r\nat  random.  There is a mobile squad in  the  Traffic\r\n\r\nPolice  that specially deals with this. Sir, if  they\r\n\r\ntake measures to deal with speeding motorcyclists  it\r\n\r\nis  all  right, but it is not right to flag down  any\r\n\r\ndriver who has not been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspeeding. Also, there have been complaints that  some\r\n\r\nmobile  squad personnel themselves have been speeding\r\n\r\non   the  road,  recklessly  and  dangerously.  Their\r\n\r\nperformance  could well beat any racing motorcyclist.\r\n\r\nThis  is  what  they should not do because  they  are\r\n\r\nendangering  other  road users.  So  the  authorities\r\n\r\nconcerned  should  look  into  this  matter.   Police\r\n\r\nofficers  are  people who enforce the  law.  So  they\r\n\r\nthemselves should not infringe any law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, the Police Force in our Republic\r\n\r\nhas  performed well with a high degree of efficiency.\r\n\r\nTheir  duty is to protect lives and property  of  our\r\n\r\npeople.  In order to increase the efficiency  of  our\r\n\r\npolice and to promote better cooperation between  the\r\n\r\npolice  and  members of the public,  I  have  several\r\n\r\nsuggestions to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years the police has been organising\r\n\r\nPolice Weeks every year. The response has been  good.\r\n\r\nIt  improves the relationship between the police  and\r\n\r\nthe public. Since it is good and useful, I would like\r\n\r\nto   ask  the  Minister  whether  Police  Weeks  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be organised. Personally,  I  think  it\r\n\r\nshould   be  held  so  as  to  build  up   a   better\r\n\r\nrelationship  between  the  police  and  the  people.\r\n\r\nBesides  achieving  better  cooperation  between  the\r\n\r\npolice  and  the  people, I would  like  to  ask  the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether the Police could organise an  \"Open\r\n\r\nHouse  Day\" for members of the public to visit police\r\n\r\nestablishments.  This  can  be  done   also   through\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres and other public  centres  because\r\n\r\nduring  \"Open House Day\" members of the  public  will\r\n\r\nlearn how to liaise with the police in the event of a\r\n\r\ncrime  or  accident.  In  this  way  the  people  can\r\n\r\nunderstand the work of the police better and  on  the\r\n\r\nother  hand  it will promote cooperation between  the\r\n\r\npeople  and the police. This is a good objective.  In\r\n\r\norder  to  achieve it concrete steps must  be  taken.\r\n\r\nSenior  police officers themselves should set a  good\r\n\r\nexample  in promoting this cooperation. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nevery  policeman of the rank of Inspector  and  above\r\n\r\nshould  frequently take part in social and  community\r\n\r\nactivities.  For instance, they should take  part  in\r\n\r\nactivities  conducted  by community  centres  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstituencies. The police officer in charge  of  the\r\n\r\nconstituency should be present. This will  promote  a\r\n\r\nbetter understanding of the relationship between  the\r\n\r\npolice and the public, thereby removing any bias that\r\n\r\nexists  between  them. There is a  feeling  that  the\r\n\r\npolice  are  \"unapproachable ones\".  Therefore,  with\r\n\r\ngreater  cooperation  and understanding  between  the\r\n\r\npolice  and  the people, members of the public  would\r\n\r\ndare  to  make  reports  to the  police  if  anything\r\n\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe  would  set up in every police district  a  public\r\n\r\ncomplaints bureau at a convenient place to facilitate\r\n\r\ncomplaints  from the public, because ordinary  people\r\n\r\nare not used to complain or to report any case to the\r\n\r\npolice,  particularly when there are police  officers\r\n\r\nwho  are haughty and arrogant. So the people dare not\r\n\r\ngo  and  report to a police station. The  officer  in\r\n\r\ncharge  in  the complaints bureau should be bilingual\r\n\r\nor  even  multi-lingual  in order  to  facilitate  an\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the complaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nwill  consider increasing the number of police patrol\r\n\r\ncars in order to increase efficiency. At the moment I\r\n\r\nfeel   that  the  number  of  patrol  cars   is   not\r\n\r\nsufficient.  Not  so  long ago at my  meet-the-people\r\n\r\nsession a voter complained to me that somebody  threw\r\n\r\nstones at his house. I telephoned for a police patrol\r\n\r\ncar but it turned up only half an hour later. I asked\r\n\r\nhim why he took such a long time to come. He said. \"I\r\n\r\nam  sorry,  but we are short of patrol  cars.\"  So  I\r\n\r\nappeal  to  the  Minister to increase the  number  of\r\n\r\npatrol  cars, as it will not only meet  the  need  to\r\n\r\nmaintain   law  and  order  but  also  increase   the\r\n\r\nefficiency of the police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth point is the white cross-lines drawn by\r\n\r\nthe  side of many roads. Recently somebody complained\r\n\r\nto  me  that  because he was not  familiar  with  the\r\n\r\nmeaning of the white cross-lines on the road, he  ran\r\n\r\ninto  them and was fined $50. According to the Police\r\n\r\nauthority's  explanation to him,  such  white  cross-lines on the road mean that they represent stones. If\r\n\r\none runs over the white cross-lines it means that one\r\n\r\nis knocking\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nagainst the stone. So it is a traffic offence and the\r\n\r\ndriver will be fined. This is really funny. I do  not\r\n\r\nquite  understand the use of this road sign  at  all.\r\n\r\nSome  people commented that perhaps this  is  because\r\n\r\nthe traffic police want more revenue that they induce\r\n\r\ndrivers to run over such lines drawn on narrow roads.\r\n\r\nDuring  peak hours when traffic is very heavy  people\r\n\r\nwould  inevitably run over the white cross-lines.  So\r\n\r\nthe traffic policemen standing by the road side would\r\n\r\ntake  down the car numbers and fine the motorists.  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to look into the matter. What\r\n\r\nare these white lines drawn on the road for? They had\r\n\r\nbetter be abolished as they serve no useful purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resiting of\r\n\r\npolice  stations in modern structural buildings  near\r\n\r\nhousing estates is a wise move. I wonder whether  any\r\n\r\nconsideration  has  been given to  locating  the  new\r\n\r\nsites.  Most of the old police stations were  located\r\n\r\nat  street junctions, and there must be a reason  for\r\n\r\nthis. It could be for a greater public awareness of a\r\n\r\npolice  station  and also for easy  access.  But  the\r\n\r\npresent  new  sites do not appear to  be  located  at\r\n\r\nstreet  junctions, and when the old  police  stations\r\n\r\nare removed there seems to be a vacuum in that area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kandang Kerbau Police Station is a hundred years\r\n\r\nold  but  recently it has been removed to Toa  Payoh.\r\n\r\nWhy not use the old station as a sub-station, because\r\n\r\nthe  nearest  police station at the  moment  for  the\r\n\r\npeople living around there seems to be far away?  The\r\n\r\nvacuum  is already felt by the people living in  that\r\n\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the CID is also going to be\r\n\r\nrehoused. I am sure that this resiting will  leave  a\r\n\r\nvacuum in that area. The CID building has been in the\r\n\r\nCentral  Business  District where  much  activity  is\r\n\r\ngoing  on,  and  the people are also aware  that  its\r\n\r\npresence  provides  some sort  of  police  protection\r\n\r\naround,  especially by the various offices  in  town.\r\n\r\nBut now, when the CID moves out, the vacuum would  be\r\n\r\ngreatly felt. Instead of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrehousing  it,  why  not renovate  the  building  and\r\n\r\ncontinue with its operations from there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the introduction of the Police national service\r\n\r\nis   remarkable.   About  9,000  part-time   national\r\n\r\nservicemen  are now serving in the Force.  With  this\r\n\r\nincreased  manpower  in  the  Force,  does  it   have\r\n\r\nsufficient  equipment and vehicles to  support  their\r\n\r\noperation?  I understand the Force is short  of  such\r\n\r\nfacilities.  What is the Ministry going to  do  about\r\n\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do the police offices in the stations have\r\n\r\nenough telephones? At times in cases of emergency  it\r\n\r\nis extremely difficult to contact certain officers in\r\n\r\nthe  stations  simply because there are  insufficient\r\n\r\ntelephones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years the rate of armed robbery\r\n\r\nhas  gone  down considerably. In 1971 the figure  was\r\n\r\n1,124  and  at the end of last year it was less  than\r\n\r\n500.  This  is  because  of the  performance  of  the\r\n\r\nsection  which  deals  with  the  combating  of  such\r\n\r\ncrimes.  The  section concerned must be congratulated\r\n\r\nfor  the  good work and I hope that it will  continue\r\n\r\nwith the good performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lately commercial crime has become one of the\r\n\r\ncommonest   forms  of  crime  in  Singapore.   Though\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  a  commercial centre  there  are  many\r\n\r\ncriminal opportunists lurking around and they are all\r\n\r\nwaiting to make a fast buck. In fact, some foreigners\r\n\r\nhave even joined in the game. The Slater Walker trial\r\n\r\nis  a  good example of this. Is it because they  feel\r\n\r\nthat commercial crime does pay here, or is it because\r\n\r\nthe  punishment is not severe enough?  I  think  most\r\n\r\nprobably  the  Minister for Home Affairs  knows  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a big gang operating in the bank. The  bank\r\n\r\nis  a big one. Or is it because the Commercial Branch\r\n\r\ndoes  not  have enough suitably qualified persons  to\r\n\r\nhelp  in the detection of this form of crime? If  so,\r\n\r\nwhat is being done to remedy the situation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An increasing number of countries in the West use\r\n\r\ncomputers  to aid them in police work. Do the  police\r\n\r\nhere also have these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfacilities to help them detect criminals quickly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past we have been talking so much about\r\n\r\npeople  sporting  long and unkempt hair.  It  appears\r\n\r\nthat  many  people nowadays are still  sporting  long\r\n\r\nhair  and  yet  no  action has been taken.  I  wonder\r\n\r\nwhether  this policy is still in existence or  is  it\r\n\r\nbeing  relaxed. I think most probably it  is  relaxed\r\n\r\nbecause everybody is sporting long hair now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, are the traffic lights synchronised at\r\n\r\nstreet  junctions? Although some traffic  lights  are\r\n\r\nvery  close together, they operate independently  and\r\n\r\nsometimes  cause  more confusion  than  help  in  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  flow.  The traffic lights  at  Keppel  Road,\r\n\r\nCantonment  Road, Tanjong Pagar Road and  Anson  Road\r\n\r\njunction are typical examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me answer\r\n\r\nthe  last speaker first, the Member for Anson. He has\r\n\r\ngiven  another  bouquet to a certain section  of  the\r\n\r\nPolice Force about combating crime. I hope he is  not\r\n\r\nthrowing  a  drop of ink into a bucket  of  milk!  He\r\n\r\nasked whether when rebuilding old police stations and\r\n\r\nrelocating  them  in Housing Board  estates  we  have\r\n\r\ngiven  consideration to the various factors and  what\r\n\r\nare they.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain, first of all, that for policing\r\n\r\npurposes   Singapore  is  divided  into  eight   land\r\n\r\ndivisions.  Each Division is served by a headquarters\r\n\r\nstation  and when necessary supported by sub-stations\r\n\r\nand  police  posts. The siting of  these  old  police\r\n\r\nstations that were built during the colonial era  was\r\n\r\ndone  in  the  then  centres  or  concentrations   of\r\n\r\npopulation,  that is, along arterial highways.  Since\r\n\r\nthen,  Sir,  there has been tremendous  redevelopment\r\n\r\nand  urban  renewal  in  the Republic,  resulting  in\r\n\r\nmassive  shifts of population. Thus, the majority  of\r\n\r\nthe existing Divisional headquarters stations are not\r\n\r\nonly  old  and  need to be rebuilt but  are  also  no\r\n\r\nlonger   strategically  situated  to   be   maximally\r\n\r\neffective operationally. As revealed in the  Addendum\r\n\r\nto  the  Presidential Address, these will be  resited\r\n\r\nwithin the next five years. The divisional boundaries\r\n\r\nof  the  police divisions will also be re-demarcated.\r\n\r\nThe recent' relocation of the Kandang Kerbau Police\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nStation  to Toa Payoh Town and the proposed  resiting\r\n\r\nof  the  other  Divisional headquarters stations  are\r\n\r\ndone to achieve the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) to provide at the doorstep of large Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  estates  police service  and  other  amenities\r\n\r\nwithin the wider meaning of community service;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) to provide speedy response to public calls and\r\n\r\nprompt investigation;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) to prevent criminal activities through police\r\n\r\npresence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) to provide a psychological boost to residents\r\n\r\nthat   police   assistance/protection   are   readily\r\n\r\navailable;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) to provide a base for strengthening police and\r\n\r\npublic cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific question as to whether we have plans\r\n\r\nto  establish a police post or substation at the  old\r\n\r\nKandang  Kerbau  Police Station site,  we  have  none\r\n\r\nbecause  the  present  site  is  required  for  urban\r\n\r\nrenewal.  Police coverage of the Kandang Kerbau  area\r\n\r\nis being adequately undertaken by radio cars and team\r\n\r\npolicing patrol cars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the removal of the CID building from\r\n\r\nthe  present site, I do not know where the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson got his news because as far as -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

As far\r\n\r\nas  CID  is concerned, there is no immediate plan  to\r\n\r\nrehouse it elsewhere. In fact, plans have been  drawn\r\n\r\nup  to  renovate  the  building and  to  improve  the\r\n\r\naccommodation  so  that the part which  the  ISD  has\r\n\r\nvacated  will be occupied by the CID. I do  not  know\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is in the Anson constituency but  anyway\r\n\r\nthe  Member  can rest assured that the  CID  will  be\r\n\r\nthere for quite some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Police national servicemen - the\r\n\r\npart-time  SCs  and VCs -we have at the  moment  over\r\n\r\n7,000 SCs and over 7,500 VCs attached to the various\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npolice  divisions. They are doing good work in  doing\r\n\r\npatrols to prevent crime in the various divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to equipment - walkie-talkies and patrol\r\n\r\ncars  - these 7,000 SCs and 7,500 VCs are using about\r\n\r\n772  walkie-talkie sets. However, I agree that  owing\r\n\r\nto  this increased number of foot patrols there is at\r\n\r\nthe  moment a shortage of these sets and as a  result\r\n\r\nfunds  are  now  being sought from  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance to buy additional sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the police telephone exchange, the\r\n\r\nPolice Force have got a PABX Exchange. At the moment,\r\n\r\nit  has  40  exchange lines which service  the  whole\r\n\r\nPolice  Force. Each of the eight land divisions  have\r\n\r\nthree  exchange lines and three direct lines.  During\r\n\r\npeak  periods  these lines are insufficient  to  cope\r\n\r\nwith  demands  and, therefore, it would be  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult  at such times to contact certain  officers\r\n\r\nin  police  stations. However, when the Home  Affairs\r\n\r\nMinistry headquarters shifts to Phoenix Park  in  the\r\n\r\nlatter  part of this year, its existing PABX will  be\r\n\r\ntaken  over  by the police. As a result,  the  police\r\n\r\nexchange will then have 53 exchange lines which would\r\n\r\nhelp  ease  the  congestion  during  peak  hours  and\r\n\r\nemergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has spoken about unscrupulous\r\n\r\nfinancial operators manipulating in banks. I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow whether he has any direct evidence. If he has, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to have any details from him and we would\r\n\r\ninvestigate.  But  as far as we are concerned,  these\r\n\r\nunscrupulous persons are found in every country where\r\n\r\nthey   feel  there  is  a  fast  buck  to  be   made.\r\n\r\nParticularly  in Singapore when it is  growing  as  a\r\n\r\nfinancial   centre,  it  is  inevitable  that   these\r\n\r\nunscrupulous  operators will attempt  to  make  quick\r\n\r\nprofit  at the expense of Singaporeans. We are  aware\r\n\r\nof  this  and plans are being made to strengthen  the\r\n\r\nCommercial Branch of the Police. It is now a division\r\n\r\nof  the  CID  headed by a Superintendent and  staffed\r\n\r\nwith  professionals,  such as lawyers  and  qualified\r\n\r\naccountants. There are plans to strengthen\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthis further to meet the threat posed by white-collar\r\n\r\ncriminals, and this has been set out in the  Addendum\r\n\r\non   the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  However,  the\r\n\r\nsituation  is  continuously being monitored  and  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will  not hesitate to  enhance  penalties\r\n\r\nshould this become necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to computers, at the moment the police\r\n\r\ncriminal  records  are  already  on  computer.  These\r\n\r\ncomputerised  records  are  useful  aids  to   police\r\n\r\ninvestigation and men on the ground are now  able  to\r\n\r\nscreen suspects in a matter of minutes without having\r\n\r\nto take the suspects to the Criminal Records Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Government's policy against males\r\n\r\nsporting  long  hair, it still stands.  We  have  not\r\n\r\nforgotten about it. This policy is strictly  enforced\r\n\r\nin all Government departments and disciplinary action\r\n\r\nis  taken  against Government officers sporting  long\r\n\r\nhair. In keeping with Government's policy, members of\r\n\r\nthe  public  sporting long hair having business  with\r\n\r\nGovernment departments are dealt with last.  Suspects\r\n\r\nand accused persons in police custody are advised not\r\n\r\nto sport long hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to traffic lights, of all the 235\r\n\r\ntraffic  lights  in Singapore, 60  are  in  the  City\r\n\r\ndistrict  and they are synchronised to give a  simple\r\n\r\ngreen wave system. For example, the traffic lights at\r\n\r\nBras  Basah  Road,  Orchard Road, Stamford  Road  and\r\n\r\nRobinson Road are synchronised and the traffic lights\r\n\r\nat  Cantonment Road, Keppel Road junction and Tanjong\r\n\r\nPagar  junction are also synchronised.  However,  the\r\n\r\ntraffic  lights  at Keppel Road/Anson  Road  junction\r\n\r\nwill be synchronised this year with the completion of\r\n\r\nthe  extension  of Shenton Way from  Palmer  Road  to\r\n\r\nAnson  Road. I hope that will satisfy the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the Member for Sembawang. The Member\r\n\r\nspoke  about police/public relationship and the  good\r\n\r\nresponse  the  public had given to  the  Police  Week\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and he asked whether they will  continue.\r\n\r\nFor his information, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice  Week programmes will continue and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nthis  year we will have another Police Week in  June.\r\n\r\nIn  fact, the Police Week programme and the fostering\r\n\r\nof  good  relationship between  the  police  and  the\r\n\r\npublic  have resulted in some success. There are  now\r\n\r\nmore  civic-conscious members of the  public  ringing\r\n\r\n999   to  give  information  to  the  police  on  the\r\n\r\nincidence of crime, and some have even gone so far as\r\n\r\nto  aid victims of crime. We are also receiving  more\r\n\r\ninformation from the public to help the police in the\r\n\r\ndetection and arrest of criminals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the programme for this year's Police Week,\r\n\r\nthere  is an arrangement for a harbour tour and party\r\n\r\nfor  the  under-privileged children,  inter-community\r\n\r\nand inter-school sports, and band displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> And dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> There is no dinner. I do not\r\n\r\nthink it is necessary to have dinners. The Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has suggested that the Police Inspectors in\r\n\r\nthe various divisions should socialise with community\r\n\r\nleaders  and  MPs  in the various constituencies.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  there  has  been a standing order  to  all  OC\r\n\r\nDivisions   that   whenever   police   officers   are\r\n\r\ntransferred to a certain division they should contact\r\n\r\nthe MP and get to know him and the community leaders.\r\n\r\nSometimes  they  also attend certain  functions.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  when  there  is a campaign  against  crime\r\n\r\npolice  officers are invited by the community leaders\r\n\r\nto  go to the community centres to give talks and  so\r\n\r\non.  That is the way they socialise and get  to  know\r\n\r\ncommunity   leaders  and  MPs  better.   Of   course,\r\n\r\nsometimes they are invited to dinners, but I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  they  should be encouraged to  go  to  dinners\r\n\r\notherwise  they  will  not  be  able  to  keep  their\r\n\r\nwaistline trim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  the police officers to attend  to  their\r\n\r\nwork and not to take part in dinners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand\r\n\r\nthat,  but  maybe I have been thinking that  with  so\r\n\r\nmany community centres in Sembawang I often see on TV\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhis community centres hold quite a lot of dinners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has brought up the point\r\n\r\nabout difficulty in contacting a Police Inspector  in\r\n\r\na  police  station. He said that the person concerned\r\n\r\nwas  asked to wait for the Police Inspector, and that\r\n\r\nlater on he was told that he could file his complaint\r\n\r\nto  any police officer other than a Police Inspector.\r\n\r\nMay I say that Police Inspectors are not supposed  to\r\n\r\nstay  in  the police station all the time.  A  Police\r\n\r\nInspector has got work to do and much of his work  is\r\n\r\ndone outside the police station. If any member of the\r\n\r\npublic  were to go and make a complaint,  it  is  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  him to see the Inspector.  There  are\r\n\r\nother  senior officers like the sergeant to  whom  he\r\n\r\ncan  make a complaint. In fact, members of the public\r\n\r\nare  welcome  to  go to the police station  and  make\r\n\r\ncomplaints. Therefore, I do not think it is necessary\r\n\r\nto  set  up  a  complaints  bureau  in  every  police\r\n\r\ndivision.  We have already got the Central Complaints\r\n\r\nBureau.  I think quite a number of complaints against\r\n\r\npolice officers are sometimes channelled through  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Complaints  Bureau. It  is,  therefore,  not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the Ministry of Home Affairs  or  the\r\n\r\nPolice  Department to set up a complaints  bureau  in\r\n\r\nthe  various police divisions because it will be just\r\n\r\na   waste  of  manpower  and  a  duplication  of  the\r\n\r\nfacilities which already exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has said that there are not\r\n\r\nsufficient patrol cars on the road. He mentioned  the\r\n\r\ncase  where  it  took more than half an  hour  for  a\r\n\r\npatrol  car to arrive at the scene when he telephoned\r\n\r\nfor  one.  The  answer  to  that  is  that  with  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the team policing scheme in  1976\r\n\r\neach  Land Division has four to five cars on the road\r\n\r\nat  any  one  time. Prior to this, each Division  had\r\n\r\nonly  two  to three cars on the road per  shift.  The\r\n\r\nLand  Division  patrol  network  is  supplemented  by\r\n\r\npatrol  cars from the Radio Division which patrol  25\r\n\r\ncentres  over  the  Republic and  augmented  by  foot\r\n\r\npatrols  comprising the Police National  Service  and\r\n\r\nthe CSF. Patrol cars take action on service calls  as\r\n\r\nwell   as  perform  crime  prevention  and  detection\r\n\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average response time to patrol cars from the\r\n\r\nRadio  Division is between 10 to 15 minutes. However,\r\n\r\noccasionally    too   many   calls    are    received\r\n\r\nsimultaneously  and  at close intervals.  Under  such\r\n\r\ncircumstances  cases  are attended  to  in  order  of\r\n\r\npriority.  Therefore, cases of lesser importance  and\r\n\r\nurgency will have to wait until patrol cars could  be\r\n\r\nspared from more urgent duties. Delays in arrival  at\r\n\r\nthe  scene are at times attributable to traffic  jams\r\n\r\nowing  to the vast increase in vehicular traffic  and\r\n\r\nthe  difficulty  in  locating  the  site  because  of\r\n\r\nincorrect  information given by the person requesting\r\n\r\nfor assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the present patrol strength is considered\r\n\r\nadequate to meet the public needs. However, the fleet\r\n\r\nand  response time to calls are closely monitored and\r\n\r\nchanges will be made in accordance with demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member was complaining about the Traffic Police\r\n\r\nbooking  drivers at random. Let me say that  they  do\r\n\r\nbook  drivers  at  random. This is called  \"selective\r\n\r\nenforcement\".  Let  me  explain  what  is  meant   by\r\n\r\nselective  enforcement. Selective  enforcement  means\r\n\r\nthat  they watch the motorists or drivers and if they\r\n\r\nsee  that  they have committed an offence, they  will\r\n\r\nbook the person. So it may appear to be at random. On\r\n\r\nthe  other hand, we see the public urging that  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  more stricter enforcement of drivers  who\r\n\r\nare  erring. But it is rather odd that the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang has taken the opposite stand. It is  rather\r\n\r\nodd  because  there  has been too many  accidents  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and a lot of deaths, killing  and  maiming\r\n\r\ngoing on, on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\non  a  point of clarification. I did not say that  we\r\n\r\nshould not book drivers who speed. However, we should\r\n\r\nnot book those who do not speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> There are many types of traffic\r\n\r\noffences. Speeding is only one of them. These drivers\r\n\r\nmay not be speeding but they may be committing one of\r\n\r\na  host  of  traffic offences. They  should  also  be\r\n\r\nbooked, for instance, for recklessly overtaking, road\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhogging, not giving way to traffic, and so on and  so\r\n\r\nforth. I believe the Member for Katong who sits  near\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Sembawang knows  more  about  these\r\n\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Hear, hear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Perhaps he can inform the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang  all  about the intricacies  of  these\r\n\r\nthings.  The  Member said that he was a bit  confused\r\n\r\nabout the white lines. It is a bit strange that  some\r\n\r\nof  these  white  lines  should  puzzle  him  because\r\n\r\nsomebody  has told him that they symbolise stones.  I\r\n\r\nmyself  am  a bit surprised and puzzled  by  what  he\r\n\r\nmeans. So I am not in a position to comment or  reply\r\n\r\nto  him. Perhaps he could ask the person who told him\r\n\r\nabout it to clarify, so that he can write me a letter\r\n\r\nand  if it is intelligible, then I will certainly  do\r\n\r\nmy  best to explain what these white lines, which are\r\n\r\nsupposed to represent stones, mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to police and public relationship. Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the development or promotion of  police\r\n\r\nand  public relationship is not only confined to  the\r\n\r\nPolice Week. It is a continuous and sustained matter.\r\n\r\na  continuous matter which must be sustained all  the\r\n\r\nyear round. As far as the Ministry of Home Affairs is\r\n\r\nconcerned,   the  police  headquarters   has   issued\r\n\r\nspecific  directives  and  instructions  that  police\r\n\r\nofficers  must show a good example. They have  to  be\r\n\r\ncourteous  and  considerate  when  dealing  with  the\r\n\r\npublic   at  all  times.  I  believe  there   is   an\r\n\r\nimprovement to-date although there may be some  cases\r\n\r\nwhere these strict directives have not been followed.\r\n\r\nBut  if  there  are  cases  of  abuse  of  power  and\r\n\r\ndiscourtesy,  any MP or member of the  public  is  at\r\n\r\nliberty  to  write in and action will  be  taken.  In\r\n\r\nfact, they should be encouraged to do so. It is  only\r\n\r\nwhen  they  write in that we get the  feed-back, and\r\n\r\naction can be taken and the position improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, coming to the Member for Katong about Project\r\n\r\nLibra. I am glad that he has highlighted this and  he\r\n\r\nhas,  in  fact, made an ardent appeal for support  to\r\n\r\nthis  worthwhile  project of social  service  to  our\r\n\r\nyouths.  The Project Libra has been launched  in  the\r\n\r\nJoo Chiat Police Division with the cooperation of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Katong and other MPs. If  it  proves\r\n\r\nsuccessful, it will be launched in other divisions as\r\n\r\nwell.  The  comments of the Member for Katong  should\r\n\r\ncertainly give an encouragement to those officers who\r\n\r\nare now engaged in this Project Libra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to his suggestion that if we are to\r\n\r\nestablish  neighbourhood committees  in  the  various\r\n\r\ndistricts we should consult the MPs and the Citizens'\r\n\r\nConsultative Committee, I assure him that  that  will\r\n\r\nbe  done, because it is only by consulting the MP and\r\n\r\nthe  CCC  in the area can any project in the  various\r\n\r\nconstituencies get going.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with\r\n\r\nyour kind permission can I just ask the Hon.

I  am\r\n\r\naware that previously instructions have been given to\r\n\r\nthe telephone operators at HQ not to insist on asking\r\n\r\nthe  identity  of  the caller. But  it  appears  that\r\n\r\nnowadays they do ask for the caller's identity.  Many\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the public have been put  off  by  this.\r\n\r\nCould not the Hon. Minister therefore insist that the\r\n\r\nidentity of the caller be not asked?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there is a rationale why the\r\n\r\ncaller  should identify himself or herself. First  of\r\n\r\nall,  as  the  Member for Sembawang has  brought  up,\r\n\r\nsometimes  when he calls for police  help  or  for  a\r\n\r\npolice patrol car there is a delay, it is because  at\r\n\r\nthe  time when he called there were so many calls for\r\n\r\npatrol cars and police help. And so he has to wait  a\r\n\r\nlonger  time. One of the reasons why a caller  should\r\n\r\nidentify  himself is that we have to know whether  it\r\n\r\nis  a  genuine call and not somebody just ringing  up\r\n\r\nfor fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the caller not only has to\r\n\r\nidentify  himself but also to tell where  he  can  be\r\n\r\nlocated,  so  that  it is easier for  the  police  to\r\n\r\nlocate the scene of the crime or incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have two\r\n\r\nmore  questions to ask the Minister. Firstly, he  did\r\n\r\nnot  answer  my  question relating to  the  complaint\r\n\r\nagainst  speeding  of  Mobile  Squad  members.   They\r\n\r\nperform speeding stunts on the road. Who is there  to\r\n\r\ncomplain against such behaviour? If there is no  such\r\n\r\ncomplaint, how is the Police Department going to take\r\n\r\naction  to  stop or to prevent members of the  Mobile\r\n\r\nSquad from speeding and performing stunts before  the\r\n\r\npublic? That is the first point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that the Minister does not seem\r\n\r\nto be sure about the white lines drawn on the side of\r\n\r\nthe  road. This is rather strange. Since the Minister\r\n\r\ndoes  not seem to know the traffic signs made by  his\r\n\r\nown Ministry, then it is very difficult for people to\r\n\r\nknow  what they mean. Can the Minister explain to  us\r\n\r\nwhat is the meaning of this particular road sign?  In\r\n\r\nthe  Alexandra  area, we can see  these  white  lines\r\n\r\ndrawn at the side of the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is not that I do not know\r\n\r\nor  cannot  identify traffic signs. What I meant  was\r\n\r\nthat I could not identify the traffic sign the Member\r\n\r\nfor Sembawang was trying to tell me about because  he\r\n\r\nhimself said that he is a bit confused and that it is\r\n\r\nvery  funny.

I  applauded. I felt at  last  we  are  going\r\n\r\nsomewhere   in   instilling  greater   courtesy   and\r\n\r\nconsideration  among  road users.  Better  late  than\r\n\r\nnever.  I  do not know whether it is because  of  the\r\n\r\ntardiness of such action or because the Minister  has\r\n\r\npromised a comprehensive and systematic treatment  of\r\n\r\nthe  problem of introducing more care and  discipline\r\n\r\non  the roads that it will take the next three  years\r\n\r\nto  achieve  all  this. But since  the  Minister  has\r\n\r\nspoken about a series of measures and has in his mind\r\n\r\na  programme, he may be in a position at the  present\r\n\r\nmoment  to  give  us  some more  details  of  such  a\r\n\r\nprogramme starting perhaps with a rundown (forgive me\r\n\r\nfor  using  this  term, Sir) on  the  result  whether\r\n\r\nsuccessful  or  otherwise, of  the  series  of  mini\r\n\r\ncampaigns  that  the traffic police  commenced  since\r\n\r\nOctober last year. It would seem that what is crucial\r\n\r\nto  the  success  of  the  Minister's  plans  is  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  of  the  police in terms  of  manpower  and\r\n\r\nequipment  to take adequate enforcement measures.  In\r\n\r\nall the times that I have almost ritually brought  up\r\n\r\nthis subject in the House up to the present moment, I\r\n\r\nhave not noticed that there has been such adequacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo Choo Kok is not here.

At the moment, all we have to  do\r\n\r\nis to take a short drive and we can locate perhaps 10\r\n\r\nto  20 offending drivers keeping to the centre of the\r\n\r\nroad.  Let me take Members on a hypothetical  journey\r\n\r\nof   a   person  leaving  his  office  to   keep   an\r\n\r\nappointment. He goes on the road and the first  thing\r\n\r\nhe  comes across is the slow driver who is keeping to\r\n\r\nthe  centre of the road, on the off-side lane.

He could knock down a cyclist. So he\r\n\r\nmust overtake on the right because our law is to keep\r\n\r\nleft.  So  he  must  overtake on the  right.  But  he\r\n\r\ncannot. He is getting angry, so he overtakes  on  the\r\n\r\nleft. He goes along the road and he comes across  two\r\n\r\ncars driving abreast and blocking the road. Both were\r\n\r\ndriving  below the speed limit. Again he  horned  and\r\n\r\nflashed his lights. Neither of the drivers gives way.\r\n\r\nHe  gets very angry. Finally one decided to move off.\r\n\r\nSo  he  overtakes. This goes on and he is  confronted\r\n\r\nwith four or five more different offences. It reaches\r\n\r\na  stage  when  he gets frustrated. He  comes  across\r\n\r\nanother offence. This time he just overtakes  on  the\r\n\r\nleft  and there is a motorcyclist. There is a  \"bang\"\r\n\r\nand he has met with an accident. The poor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmotorcyclist  is  killed. He might lose  his  driving\r\n\r\nlicence  or  even go to jail. The offenders  are  the\r\n\r\nslow  drivers who drive in the right-hand lane. Right\r\n\r\nnow  we  have campaigns such as, \"Don't Road Hog\"  or\r\n\r\n\"Keep in lane\", etc. The number of offenders does not\r\n\r\nseem to decrease,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Senior Minister of State for\r\n\r\nCommunications  said that the Points  Demerit  System\r\n\r\nmight  be  extended to road hoggers or the number  of\r\n\r\npoints  might  be increased. I welcome this  move.  I\r\n\r\nthink it is a good idea. For those who have lived  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  all their lives and go overseas  for  only\r\n\r\nshort  periods, cannot see this. But  for  those  who\r\n\r\nhave  lived  overseas for some  time  and  have  been\r\n\r\ndriving there, the moment they come back to Singapore\r\n\r\nthey  will know that the road condition is  good  and\r\n\r\nthe  traffic condition is much better than any of the\r\n\r\nmajor  cities  around us. This particular  offence  - drivers  not  keeping to the left -  makes  our  road\r\n\r\ncondition really bad. If we can get them to  keep  to\r\n\r\nthe  left, there  will be no offence.  There  is  no\r\n\r\nproblem if they drive in the centre lane or the  off-side  lane of the road if there is no traffic  behind\r\n\r\nthem.  But  if there is a car coming up, they  should\r\n\r\nkeep  to  the  left  and let that car  overtake  them\r\n\r\nbecause  after overtaking the car can get on its  way\r\n\r\nand  its  travelling time is lessened. If  travelling\r\n\r\ntime is lessened, there will be less congestion,  and\r\n\r\nwith less congestion there is less frustration, and I\r\n\r\nam  sure  there will be less accidents.  So  can  the\r\n\r\nMinister   for  Home  Affairs  conduct   a   vigorous\r\n\r\ncampaign, hopefully within the next couple  of  years\r\n\r\nso  that  we  can  rid  ourselves  of  motorists  who\r\n\r\ninsisted  on driving on the right hand lane  or  off-side lane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is the horn. I was in a taxi the\r\n\r\nother  day. There was no traffic to the left  and  to\r\n\r\nthe  right, and no traffic either in front  or  back.\r\n\r\nBut about every nine seconds (after a while I started\r\n\r\ntiming it) the driver just pipped his horn. A lot  of\r\n\r\nthese  \"neurotic horn pushers\", I call them,  for  no\r\n\r\napparent reason keep on pipping the horn. The horn is\r\n\r\nsupposed to be used in an emergency. Right\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnow  there  is  no  meaning to the use  of  the  horn\r\n\r\nbecause  some  motorists just use it. If  both  these\r\n\r\nproblems  can  be  looked into and  perhaps  stronger\r\n\r\naction  taken, I am sure we will have less congestion\r\n\r\non the road and we will have safer roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, in reply to the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong, I am particularly gratified to note the  keen\r\n\r\ninterest  and  support  he  has  manifested  for  the\r\n\r\nprogramme of introducing more care and discipline  on\r\n\r\nour  roads. This is because the battle to bring about\r\n\r\nmore  care,  courtesy and discipline  and  to  reduce\r\n\r\ncarnage on our roads is a long and arduous one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has brought up a point\r\n\r\nabout  keeping to the left, saying that there  should\r\n\r\nbe no road hogging, and so on and so forth. All these\r\n\r\nfaults are noted. In fact, these are the faults  that\r\n\r\nhave  prompted  the  Traffic Police  to  launch  this\r\n\r\ncampaign  that will start off in June. Let me  say  a\r\n\r\nfew  things  about  this campaign.  The  road  safety\r\n\r\ncampaign  is  to  be called \"A Road Safety  for  You\"\r\n\r\ncampaign.  During  the campaign the  motoring  public\r\n\r\nwill  be advised on the proper mode of driving, after\r\n\r\nwhich   enforcement  action  will  be  taken  against\r\n\r\nviolators. The most successful formula in  the  anti-litter  campaign is that we start off  educating  the\r\n\r\npublic  with  total  community  involvement  in   the\r\n\r\ncampaign, and  after we have given due  warnings  we\r\n\r\nfollow  up with strict enforcement. I hope that  this\r\n\r\nwill   have  the  same  effect.  When  I  say  \"total\r\n\r\ncommunity  involvement\",  it  will  not  only   cover\r\n\r\nmotorists but also pedestrians. School children  will\r\n\r\nbe largely involved in this campaign since instilling\r\n\r\nof  good habit on anything, whether it be road safety\r\n\r\nor otherwise, must start with the young. As you know,\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, the school going population consists\r\n\r\nof one-quarter of our population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a prelude to this nation-wide safety campaign,\r\n\r\nthe   Traffic  Police  launched  a  series  of   mini\r\n\r\ncampaigns  on  the common motoring faults.  This  has\r\n\r\nalready  started since November last year,  and  they\r\n\r\nare \"Keep in lane\", \"Don't road hog\" and \"Give\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway\".  The current campaign now going on is \"Overtake\r\n\r\nsafely\".  This  will be followed  by  a  campaign  on\r\n\r\nturning  traffic.  The underlying  rationale  of  all\r\n\r\nthese  campaigns is that there should be more  safety\r\n\r\nand courtesy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about pedestrians? At the moment a good number\r\n\r\nof   pedestrian  crossings  have  been  provided  for\r\n\r\npedestrians  but  many fail to use them.  Because  of\r\n\r\nthis,  the Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977,  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced  to require pedestrians to use  them.  The\r\n\r\nnumber  of  pedestrian crossing  facilities  will  be\r\n\r\nincreased, particularly along arterial highways.  Two\r\n\r\nmain features of this proposed law are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Any pedestrian who is within 50 metres on either\r\n\r\nside of a pedestrian crossing is required to make use\r\n\r\nof  such  pedestrian  crossing  for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\ncrossing the road;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Every motorist is required to give way to\r\n\r\npedestrians at established pedestrian crossings.  (In\r\n\r\nother  words, we  have to be fair not  only  to  the\r\n\r\nmotorists  but  also to the pedestrians.)  Under  the\r\n\r\nproposed law, offences by pedestrians include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) crossing the road other than at an established\r\n\r\ncrossing  when the pedestrian is within 50 metres  of\r\n\r\nsuch a crossing;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) crossing other than to the parallel flow of\r\n\r\nvehicular traffic when using established crossings at\r\n\r\nsignalised intersections;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) crossing when the red man in the signalised\r\n\r\ntraffic sign is illuminated; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) stand, sit, squat, loiter or walk on the roadway\r\n\r\nin  such  a  manner  or  in such  a  position  as  to\r\n\r\ninterfere with the lawful movement of traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to offences by motorists, they include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) failure to give way to pedestrians at any\r\n\r\ncrossing   when  turning  his  vehicle  at   a   road\r\n\r\nintersection;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) failing to proceed at such speed as will enable\r\n\r\nhim to stop his vehicle when approaching a pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossing;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) failure to give way to pedestrians at pedestrian\r\n\r\ncrossings where the traffic is not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrolled  by a police officer or by light  signals,\r\n\r\nfor example, at zebra crossings;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) failure to give way to pedestrians crossing at\r\n\r\nroad  intersections where traffic  is  controlled  by\r\n\r\nlight signal or police officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pedestrian Crossing Rules, 1977, will come into\r\n\r\nforce  after the nation-wide road safety campaign  in\r\n\r\nJune.  The penalties for any contravention  of  these\r\n\r\nrules  are  prescribed under section 82 of  the  Road\r\n\r\nTraffic  Act (Chapter 92); in the case of  the  first\r\n\r\noffence,  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $1,000  or  to\r\n\r\nimprisonment  for a term not exceeding three  months;\r\n\r\nand  in  the case of a second and subsequent offence,\r\n\r\nto a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for\r\n\r\na  term not exceeding six months. These are penalties\r\n\r\nagainst   motorists,   Sir,  not   pedestrians.   For\r\n\r\npedestrians the fines will be very much lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah mentioned about a taxi\r\n\r\ndriver  who was horning all the way. May I  tell  him\r\n\r\nthat  it is an offence to horn unnecessarily. If only\r\n\r\nhe  had  taken  down the number of the  taxi  and  is\r\n\r\nprepared  to  give a statement and bear witness,  the\r\n\r\ndriver will be prosecuted. Unfortunately, he has  not\r\n\r\ndone so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter about keeping to the left is\r\n\r\ncovered by lane discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in the Minister's reference to\r\n\r\n\"total  involvement\", I hope he will also be able  to\r\n\r\nsecure the cooperation of Government departments  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards  including, of course,  the  Police\r\n\r\nwhich have lots of vehicles on the road and see  that\r\n\r\ntheir drivers obey the Highway Code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I can assure the Member for\r\n\r\nKatong that that will be done.

It is well known that\r\n\r\nthe  best rehabilitation programmes for drug  addicts\r\n\r\nin  Western countries fall between 5 and 10%  of  all\r\n\r\nthose who enter such programmes.

What I  want  to\r\n\r\nknow  is, has the cold turkey treatment been all that\r\n\r\neffective?  It  would remove physical  dependence  on\r\n\r\ndrugs,  yes,  but  could it remove the  psychological\r\n\r\ndependence?   Relapse  rates  appear  to   be   high,\r\n\r\nindicating  the poor success of whatever effort  that\r\n\r\nhas been put in so far. Would the Minister state what\r\n\r\nprogrammes,  if  any, are being put  into  action  or\r\n\r\nplanned to reduce the high relapse rate?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Home Affairs is spending large sums\r\n\r\nof  money on rehabilitating drug addicts at the  Drug\r\n\r\nRehabilitation Centre and I understand  the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Defence  has  its  own  rehabilitation  programme\r\n\r\nwhile,  at  the level of school assemblies, volunteer\r\n\r\nspeakers  are eloquently persuading youths  to  avoid\r\n\r\nthe  dangerous  path of drug abuse.  Sir,  we  should\r\n\r\nencourage  groups  like the Singapore  Anti-Narcotics\r\n\r\nAssociation (SANA) to embark on education  programmes\r\n\r\nfor  the young before they are exposed to drug abuse.\r\n\r\nIn this respect.

What  is  the  security\r\n\r\nposition now? Has any post-mortem study been made  on\r\n\r\nwhy  these  inmates  had tried  to  escape  and  then\r\n\r\nvoluntarily  returned to the Centre? The House  would\r\n\r\nbe interested to know if any steps have been taken to\r\n\r\nimprove   the  conditions  and  treatment  of   these\r\n\r\ninmates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In terms of consultation, exchange of\r\n\r\nprofessional  expertise  and  the  use  of  voluntary\r\n\r\nworkers,  what is the Centre actually doing in  these\r\n\r\nareas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) What are the main problems faced by addicts\r\n\r\nwhen they are released from the Centre?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) What follow-up action is taken to guide such\r\n\r\npersons after their release?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) What is the actual extent of the Centre's\r\n\r\ncontribution towards the solution of the drug problem\r\n\r\nin the Republic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) Are there plans to shift the present Centre\r\n\r\nsomewhere   else  in  a  better  and  more  conducive\r\n\r\nenvironment  for  such  rehabilitation  work  to   be\r\n\r\ncarried out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) There was a nation-wide and anti-drug abuse\r\n\r\ncampaign  last year organised by the NADAC  76.  What\r\n\r\nwas  the  follow-up programme carried out immediately\r\n\r\nafter the successful campaign or has the effort  been\r\n\r\nleft to die a natural death?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) To what extent have the recommendations put\r\n\r\nup by the NADAC 76 been implemented?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) Would the Minister enlighten the House on the\r\n\r\nprogress  of  the work of the Special Committee  that\r\n\r\nwas set up to look into the problems of drug abuse in\r\n\r\nthe Republic?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the answers to all these questions would be of\r\n\r\ngreat interest and concern to all of us in this House\r\n\r\nas well as those outside -    like parents, teachers,\r\n\r\nsocial workers, everyone for that matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem:</b> Sir, most of what need to be said\r\n\r\nhas  been  said.

The reason  I  ask  this\r\n\r\nquestion is that I have spoken to several parents and\r\n\r\nthey seem to pass the buck.

This is  because  the\r\n\r\nproblem  has  assumed such proportions  that  it  has\r\n\r\nbecome  a national concern. The Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nonly  two days ago in replying to a query by a Member\r\n\r\ninformed the House that there were about 700 cases of\r\n\r\ndrug  abuse  amongst the national servicemen  in  the\r\n\r\nSAF, which is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabout  1%. Let it remain a national concern, and  let\r\n\r\nit  not  become a matter of national proportion.  The\r\n\r\nlatter  would  be  a calamity if  it  is  allowed  to\r\n\r\nmaterialise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the latest arrest figures issued by the Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau, two trends stand out boldly:  One,\r\n\r\nthat  more and more of those between the ages  of  15\r\n\r\nand  35 are abusing drugs and, two, more of those  in\r\n\r\nthis  age group are abusing heroin. The total  number\r\n\r\nof  persons arrested has also gone up: from 2,858  in\r\n\r\n1971  to  6,556 in 1976, a rise of more than two-fold\r\n\r\nin numbers alone. What about the unknown addicts? How\r\n\r\nmany are there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: what other efforts and approaches\r\n\r\nare being made by the CNB, besides making arrests  of\r\n\r\naddicts  and  abusers and sending them  to  the  Drug\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  Centre  at  Telok  Paku?  While  this\r\n\r\npoints   to   the   increased   efficiency   of   law\r\n\r\nenforcement, I have certain observations to  make  in\r\n\r\nregard to the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the `cure', although there are real doubts\r\n\r\nabout this too. But what about the `prevention'? Sir,\r\n\r\nI  am  a  firm believer in adages, and certainly  the\r\n\r\nmost  famous  of these is \"Prevention is better  than\r\n\r\nCure\".  Is  the island-wide anti-drug abuse  campaign\r\n\r\nreportedly   planned   for  next   month   code-named\r\n\r\nOperation   Ferret  designed  to  be  `curative'   or\r\n\r\n`preventive'   in  function?  From  what   has   been\r\n\r\npublished,  it  appears to be more  attempted  `cure'\r\n\r\nthan  `prevention'. It should lay equal  emphasis  on\r\n\r\nboth aspects, at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, drug abuse is spreading. For the sake of\r\n\r\nthe  majority of our youths who are struggling to  do\r\n\r\nthe  right  things  in life and who  come  under  the\r\n\r\ninfluence of drug-prone youths, we must have a strong\r\n\r\nand  vigorous on-going anti-drug prevention  campaign\r\n\r\nor  programme, not only at the level of  schools  and\r\n\r\nyouth organizations, but at the community centre  and\r\n\r\nneighbourhood levels, in order to educate parents and\r\n\r\ncommunity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleaders who are in charge of guiding our youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is disturbing is the feeling in some quarters\r\n\r\nthat  the  efforts  mounted by  the  Singapore  Anti-Narcotics Association to take anti-drug education  in\r\n\r\nschools  are  being  nullified by  the  inconceivable\r\n\r\nattitudes  and thinking of some Ministry of Education\r\n\r\nofficials. If there is any truth in this,  it  is  my\r\n\r\nhope  that the Minister who is also the Minister  for\r\n\r\nEducation would take immediate steps to look into the\r\n\r\nmatter, It is in the schools that we can prevent  the\r\n\r\nbeginnings of drug abuse. It is with the schools that\r\n\r\nwe  can  inculcate in the young the sense of personal\r\n\r\nwell-being  by  avoiding drugs. It is in  the  school\r\n\r\nthat will find most ready reception. It would be most\r\n\r\nunfortunate  if  it  was  true  that  some   Ministry\r\n\r\nofficials are trying to rock the boat that prevents a\r\n\r\n\"prevention\" campaign being carried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the dangers of drug abuse are very real. There\r\n\r\nare  no doubts about this. Every ounce of effort must\r\n\r\nbe  geared  towards eradication of  this  scourge  in\r\n\r\nsociety. What we do today in this respect will have a\r\n\r\nprofound effect on the quality of a society that  our\r\n\r\nchildren will have tomorrow. In fact, Sir, if I could\r\n\r\nsuggest  to  the  Minister whether he could  consider\r\n\r\n\"Prevention through education\" to be the  panacea  of\r\n\r\nthe drug-abuse field. Where law enforcement fails  to\r\n\r\nstamp the supply of illegal drugs, and rehabilitation\r\n\r\nefforts  have  so far failed to reclaim many  abusers\r\n\r\nwhy  not  pour  the  money that we collect  from  the\r\n\r\nseizure  of smuggling heroin and other drugs  by  the\r\n\r\nCustoms into education to stop the problem before  it\r\n\r\nbegins. Perhaps we could make drug education as  part\r\n\r\nof  the  school curriculum in the teaching of Civics.\r\n\r\nOf  course, this will require a very careful in-depth\r\n\r\nstudy  and  planning  before  it  is  introduced  and\r\n\r\nimplemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Ong is not here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I first deal with drug\r\n\r\nrehabilitation? Since the beginning of 1976 a tougher\r\n\r\nprogramme of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrehabilitation was introduced. Cold turkey  treatment\r\n\r\nwas introduced and addicts at the Drug Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre  must  undergo  this  treatment  after   being\r\n\r\ncertified  fit  by a medical doctor.  No  replacement\r\n\r\ntherapy  is allowed. It is hoped that the rigours  of\r\n\r\ncold  turkey  treatment will give them an  experience\r\n\r\nwhich  they  will not forget quickly. However,  after\r\n\r\nthe cold turkey treatment, which normally takes about\r\n\r\ntwo  weeks or so, addicts are given regular  physical\r\n\r\ndrills and exercises to instil personal discipline in\r\n\r\nthem.  This is necessary because most of the  addicts\r\n\r\nare  weak  in character and lack personal discipline,\r\n\r\nor  even if they had personal discipline before  they\r\n\r\nwould  have  lost it. Therefore, work as  a  form  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  has been introduced with  a  view  to\r\n\r\ninculcating  skill  and work discipline  among  them.\r\n\r\nThey  now have to do eight hours of work a day.  This\r\n\r\nwill  help  them after they have come  out  from  the\r\n\r\nRehabilitation Centre to lead a normal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The addicts are being counselled by probation and\r\n\r\naftercare  officers  while  they  are  in  the   Drug\r\n\r\nRehabilitation  Centre. This is to establish  rapport\r\n\r\nbetween the officers and these inmates early so  that\r\n\r\ncompulsory  after-care after their release  from  the\r\n\r\nCentre   will  have  the  best  chance  of   success.\r\n\r\nRecidivism among drug addicts before the introduction\r\n\r\nof  compulsory  after-care in August 1976  was  high,\r\n\r\nabout 70%. With the introduction of compulsory after-care,  this  level of recidivism should  be  reduced.\r\n\r\nHowever, Sir, it is too early to assess the impact of\r\n\r\ncompulsory after-care. The situation is being closely\r\n\r\nmonitored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application of cold turkey treatment, a stricter\r\n\r\ncode  of  discipline, work therapy,  counselling  and\r\n\r\nafter-care, should motivate addicts to give up  drugs\r\n\r\nafter  their  release  from the  Drug  Rehabilitation\r\n\r\nCentre. Those who do not change will have to be  sent\r\n\r\nback  to  the  Centre and put through a  tougher  and\r\n\r\nlonger  rehabilitation programme.  The  treatment  of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  at  the Centre was  instituted  after\r\n\r\nconsultation with experts from the Ministry of Health\r\n\r\nand  the  Probation  and After-Care  Service  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Social Affairs. A committee has also been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformed   comprising  representatives   from   various\r\n\r\ndepartments and disciplines to look into the  matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough  no  foreign experts were sought,  treatment\r\n\r\nprogrammes in Japan, Hong Kong and the United  States\r\n\r\nand  a number of Western countries were studied,  but\r\n\r\nthey have to be modified to suit our needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bedok asked about the escape of 13\r\n\r\nmale  inmates from the Rehabilitation Centre at Telok\r\n\r\nPaku  in  August  1976. Since then  security  at  the\r\n\r\nCentre has been strengthened. Three watch towers have\r\n\r\nbeen  built to enhance surveillance, a dog and mobile\r\n\r\npatrol  has  been  introduced to  deter  attempts  to\r\n\r\nescape.  But, Mr Speaker, Sir, what I would  like  to\r\n\r\nstress,  which has not been recognised, is that  when\r\n\r\nthe  13  inmates  escaped from the Centre  they  were\r\n\r\nundergoing  cold turkey treatment at  that  time.  In\r\n\r\nother words, they had just been admitted and, as  you\r\n\r\nknow, Mr Speaker, Sir, when they are undergoing  cold\r\n\r\nturkey  treatment that is the very  time  when  their\r\n\r\ncraving  for drugs is at its height. For cold  turkey\r\n\r\ntreatment,  we  now have specially constructed  rooms\r\n\r\nwith  padded  walls and, of course, the security  has\r\n\r\nbeen enhanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the National Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign\r\n\r\norganised by the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association\r\n\r\n(SANA), what is called NADAC 1976 as referred  to  by\r\n\r\nthe Member for Bedok, we regard it as very useful  in\r\n\r\ncreating    public   awareness   and    disseminating\r\n\r\ninformation on the dangers of drug taking. After  the\r\n\r\ncampaign  SANA submitted a report to my Ministry  and\r\n\r\nmade  certain  recommendations on how to  tackle  the\r\n\r\ndrug  problem.  Most of the measures  recommended  by\r\n\r\nSANA  were, in fact, already implemented. Others have\r\n\r\nbeen  sent  to  the  relevant  Ministries  for  their\r\n\r\nconsideration. Now, the Member for Bedok has referred\r\n\r\nto  the  special committee on drug abuse among youths\r\n\r\nwhich  was  appointed in April 1974.  This  committee\r\n\r\nsubmitted  its  report in November 1976.  The  report\r\n\r\nprovides useful information on the characteristics of\r\n\r\ndrug abuse, young drug\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nabusers   and   the   cause  of   drug   abuse.   The\r\n\r\nrecommendations  of  this  committee  are  now  being\r\n\r\nstudied and will be implemented if found practical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Bedok has said that\r\n\r\nhe  believes  that \"prevention through education\"  is\r\n\r\nthe  panacea  to our problem of drug addiction.  Sir,\r\n\r\n\"prevention  through education\" can  be  one  of  the\r\n\r\naspects  in  solving  the  drug  problem  but  it  is\r\n\r\ncertainly no panacea because the drug problem  is  so\r\n\r\ncomplex  that there is no single panacea to the  drug\r\n\r\nproblem. In fact, it must be tackled from all  angles\r\n\r\nand all fronts - prevention, cure and so on. That  is\r\n\r\nbeing  done  and we are doing everything  within  our\r\n\r\npower to do so. There cannot be any single panacea in\r\n\r\nanswer to the drug problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the issue of drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking and how to contain addiction. This is  in\r\n\r\nreply  to  the  Member for Bedok as well  as  to  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Anson  who have made certain  statements\r\n\r\nearlier  on. Only heroin addiction, especially  among\r\n\r\nthe  young, has escalated during the last few  years.\r\n\r\nThe  pattern  of  increase in  drug  addiction  among\r\n\r\nyouths, as reported by the United Nations Commission\r\n\r\non  Narcotic  Drugs,  is  universal.  The  Government\r\n\r\nrealises the seriousness of the problem and  is  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  and, as I have said, it will do everything\r\n\r\nin  its  power to combat it. The battle  against  the\r\n\r\ndrug  problem  will be fought on all fronts  and,  in\r\n\r\nparticular, on two fronts; first, the elimination  of\r\n\r\nsupply  and,  secondly,  the curbing  of  demand  for\r\n\r\ndrugs.  To do this, there must be maximum cooperation\r\n\r\nor  coordination amongst all the agencies involved so\r\n\r\nthat  there  will  not  be serious  bottlenecks,  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  will  be  used to the best  advantage.  Our\r\n\r\nstrategy, therefore,  is for the  Central  Narcotics\r\n\r\nBureau  to  concentrate on the  supply  side  of  the\r\n\r\nproblem.  That  is,  to  seek  out  and  arrest  drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers and pushers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the demand side, that is, the rounding up of\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts and rehabilitating them, the large pool\r\n\r\nof  manpower  in the Special Constabulary,  Vigilante\r\n\r\nCorps,  Drug Squad and the Divisional Police will  be\r\n\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs  I have announced earlier, this massive roundup of\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts,  code named \"Operation  Ferret\",  will\r\n\r\ncommence  in  April  of this year  when  a  new  drug\r\n\r\nrehabilitation  centre will be ready  to  accommodate\r\n\r\nanother  800  addicts at a time.  \"Operation  Ferret\"\r\n\r\nwill  be  closely  monitored. After the  first  three\r\n\r\nmonths  of  the  operation, we will be  in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition   to  estimate  the  population  of   heroin\r\n\r\naddicts, the rate it is growing and the rate at which\r\n\r\naddicts who have gone through the drug rehabilitation\r\n\r\ncentre relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A committee on the treatment and rehabilitation of\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts has been recently appointed to evaluate\r\n\r\nand   make  recommendations  on  the  treatment   and\r\n\r\nrehabilitation of addicts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all these measures we are hopeful that drug\r\n\r\naddiction,  especially  among  the  young,  will   be\r\n\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order to clarify the\r\n\r\nmisconception  on the part of the Member  for  Bedok,\r\n\r\n\"Operation Ferret\" is also a prevention operation. It\r\n\r\nis  not  only a cure because, as everybody knows, if\r\n\r\nyou  have a drug addict at large and he is not caught\r\n\r\nand  put  in a rehabilitation centre, he is bound  to\r\n\r\ninfect  his other innocent friends. There will  be  a\r\n\r\nmultiplier  effect and you get more drug addicts.  In\r\n\r\nthat respect it is a prevention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Anson has suggested that exit\r\n\r\ncontrol   may   help  to  prevent   foreigners   from\r\n\r\ntrafficking   drugs  in  Singapore  in   that   their\r\n\r\noverstaying  could be easily detected. I  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim that exit control may help but only to the extent\r\n\r\nthat  foreigners  seeking entry  into  Singapore  are\r\n\r\nknown  to be drug traffickers. In fact, even  without\r\n\r\nexit control foreigners who have been involved in, or\r\n\r\nwho  are  suspected of, trafficking in drugs are  now\r\n\r\nprohibited   from   entering  into  Singapore.   Even\r\n\r\nforeigners  who  are  known  drug  addicts  are  also\r\n\r\nprohibited  from  entering Singapore.  However,  exit\r\n\r\ncontrol  would not be of help if foreign  traffickers\r\n\r\nare  not  known  to  our enforcement  agencies.  Drug\r\n\r\ntraffickers now operate in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmall  groups of three to five persons, the  majority\r\n\r\nof  whom  have  no  previous drug records  either  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  or  elsewhere. Therefore, stringent  entry\r\n\r\ncontrol  could  not  affect  these  persons  who  are\r\n\r\nunlikely  to  overstay their visits  once  they  have\r\n\r\ncompleted their nefarious activities. In these  cases\r\n\r\ncareful  investigation and intelligent  gathering  by\r\n\r\nthe  enforcement  authorities are more  important  in\r\n\r\ndetecting  the  traffickers and  dealers.

Last  year  there  were  1.5  million\r\n\r\ntourists passing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough  Singapore. Of course, many of  our  citizens\r\n\r\nhave  also  gone  abroad.  So  it  is  important  for\r\n\r\nofficers  in this department to be courteous  to  the\r\n\r\npublic. There has been a general improvement  in  the\r\n\r\nwork  of  the Immigration Department. However,  there\r\n\r\nare  certain  shortcomings.  So  let  me  inform  the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I have received many complaints from\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public that  the  officers  at  the\r\n\r\ncounters  in  the  Immigration Department  are  quite\r\n\r\ndiscourteous to members of the public.  They  do  not\r\n\r\nproperly  help  them  in  their  dealings  with   the\r\n\r\ndepartment.  Many  of them who have  business  to  go\r\n\r\nthere  are  dissatisfied and they  have  a  very  bad\r\n\r\nimpression  of  the  department.  Even  though   that\r\n\r\nimpression  is  created only by some members  of  the\r\n\r\nstaff,  it  will give a poor image to the  department\r\n\r\nthus  reflecting on the Government of Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nMinister concerned should look into it and take steps\r\n\r\nto rectify this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at Woodlands checkpoint the officers in\r\n\r\ncharge  are not doing their duty properly. They  just\r\n\r\nsit  inside  and  would  not  care  about  the  crowd\r\n\r\nthronging outside. At peak hours they would  open  up\r\n\r\nonly  two  checkpoint  entrances  leaving  the  other\r\n\r\nentrances  closed. There is usually a long  queue  of\r\n\r\nvehicles waiting to go through, particularly at  this\r\n\r\ncheckpoint because many people who pass through  that\r\n\r\ncheckpoint  everyday are either coming  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia or going from Singapore  to  Malaysia.\r\n\r\nThe  Minister should get the officers there to  speed\r\n\r\nup  their  work  and  to open more  traffic  channels\r\n\r\nduring  peak  hours at this checkpoint to  facilitate\r\n\r\ntraffic flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would also like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  he would be liberal in his consideration  of\r\n\r\napplications  for  permanent  residence.  One  of  my\r\n\r\nconstituents  who  is  a  Singapore  citizen  has   a\r\n\r\nMalaysian wife. They have been married for  over  ten\r\n\r\nyears and have two children born in Singapore. One of\r\n\r\nthem,  namely  the  husband,  is  a  store  assistant\r\n\r\nearning about $600 per month, and he has been  paying\r\n\r\nincome tax every year in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore. His monthly income is sufficient  for  him\r\n\r\nto maintain his family. He has many times applied for\r\n\r\ncitizenship for his wife but has been rejected  every\r\n\r\ntime. His case deserves sympathetic consideration and\r\n\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you on the right amendment, Mr\r\n\r\nTeong? You are talking about citizenship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong:</b> Not citizenship but permanent\r\n\r\nresidence, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in reply to the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang, may I take  his  first  point\r\n\r\nabout  providing courteous and efficient  service  to\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  public  by  Immigration  Department\r\n\r\nofficers? The Immigration Department is aware of  the\r\n\r\nneed  to provide such courteous and efficient service\r\n\r\nto  members of the public at all times. Towards  this\r\n\r\nend,  painstaking efforts have been made to inculcate\r\n\r\nmembers of the staff, especially those serving at the\r\n\r\ncounters,   to   be   courteous  and   helpful.   All\r\n\r\nImmigration staff upon recruitment undergo  a  period\r\n\r\nof  full-time orientation with emphasis  on  courtesy\r\n\r\nand  the correct attitude towards serving the public.\r\n\r\nSubsequently,   refresher  courses   and   discussion\r\n\r\nsessions  are  also organised for the  same  purpose.\r\n\r\nFurther, Mr Speaker, Sir, departmental circulars  are\r\n\r\nregularly issued to staff to remind them of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any complaint of discourtesy or rudeness from any\r\n\r\nmember of the public will be immediately investigated\r\n\r\nand  if  established appropriate disciplinary  action\r\n\r\nwill  be  taken. In 1975, only three complaints  were\r\n\r\nreceived  against  counter staff in  the  Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment. Two were found to be not true and in  the\r\n\r\nthird  case  the  officer was  warned.  In  1976, no\r\n\r\nwritten complaint was received against counter staff.\r\n\r\nHowever,  statistics are not kept on oral  complaints\r\n\r\nas  these  are settled on the spot. Where  there  was\r\n\r\ntruth  in  the  verbal complaint,  action  was  taken\r\n\r\nagainst the officer concerned. Perhaps the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang should bring to my attention if he is aware\r\n\r\nof any specific case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member's second question. He said, when\r\n\r\nhe passed through the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWoodlands  checkpoint, he saw that only two  channels\r\n\r\nwere  opened, and as a result there were long  queues\r\n\r\nof cars needed to be checked. During the greater part\r\n\r\nof the day, Sir, six or eight car lanes are opened to\r\n\r\nhandle  traffic  through  the  Woodlands  checkpoint.\r\n\r\nEight  car  lanes are maintained during  peak  hours.\r\n\r\nHowever, between midnight and the early hours of  the\r\n\r\nmorning two car lanes are opened, i.e, after midnight\r\n\r\nand  the  early hours of the morning. Sir, I  do  not\r\n\r\nknow  at  what  time  the Member  for  Sembawang  was\r\n\r\nreturning from Johore Bahru.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, allow me to\r\n\r\nclarify?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Two channels were opened. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Member  was  returning from Johore  Bahru  after\r\n\r\nmidnight.  I can quite understand his predicament  if\r\n\r\nhe was in a hurry to go back to his wife and family!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, statistics however show that during these hours\r\n\r\nan average of 20 cars pass through the lane per hour.\r\n\r\nExperience  shows that there is no  queuing  of  cars\r\n\r\nduring  this period. The hon. Member is assured  that\r\n\r\nthe  senior officers at the Woodlands checkpoint keep\r\n\r\na   constant  watch  of  the  traffic  situation  and\r\n\r\nsufficient  car lanes are always provided for  speedy\r\n\r\nclearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's third question on applications by\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizens  for  permanent  residence   (not\r\n\r\ncitizenship)  for their foreign wives are  considered\r\n\r\non  the  merits  of each case. Under the  Immigration\r\n\r\nlaw,  the  foreign  wife of a  Singapore  citizen  is\r\n\r\neligible for consideration only if she has not at any\r\n\r\ntime  after the marriage been living separately  from\r\n\r\nher husband for a continuous period of more than five\r\n\r\nyears.  Besides  income level there  are  also  other\r\n\r\nguiding  factors such as the family size,  the  roots\r\n\r\nand  whether the couple has a genuine desire to  make\r\n\r\nSingapore their permanent home. I should stress  that\r\n\r\nthe  grant  of the status of permanent residence,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, is a very important matter and  cannot\r\n\r\nbe taken too lightly because it is the first step to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\napplication for citizenship. I can assure the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Sembawang that each application by  a  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizen for permanent residence for his foreign  wife\r\n\r\nwill receive careful consideration by the Immigration\r\n\r\nDepartment and the deserving cases will be approved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, for the\r\n\r\ninformation  of the Minister, I was at the  Woodlands\r\n\r\ncheckpoint  at  6  o'clock in  the  evening,  not  at\r\n\r\nmidnight. It was at 6 p.m. during the peak hours when\r\n\r\nthere  was  heavy traffic and only two channels  were\r\n\r\nopened,   not  eight  channels,  If  the   Minister's\r\n\r\ninformation  is  eight channels, then  he  has  been\r\n\r\ndeceived.  Between  6  p.m. and  7  p.m., only  two\r\n\r\nchannels were opened. It is usually the case. Who  is\r\n\r\nthe  person  in charge of the checkpoint?  He  should\r\n\r\ninform  the  Minister correctly of the truth  of  the\r\n\r\nsituation.  He should not give the Minister  a  wrong\r\n\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning permanent residence, the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid that to qualify for consideration, the wife of a\r\n\r\nSingapore  citizen should have the minimum length  of\r\n\r\nstay  after the marriage and also the monthly  income\r\n\r\nshould be sufficient to support the family and  other\r\n\r\nfactors.  Very soon I will be writing to the Minister\r\n\r\nto inform him of this application so that he can take\r\n\r\nthe necessary action for a serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, on the last point, the\r\n\r\nMember said that he will be writing to me about  this\r\n\r\ncase.  If he had written to me earlier, then he would\r\n\r\nnot  have wasted the time of the House. I would  have\r\n\r\ngiven   him  a  satisfactory  explanation  for   that\r\n\r\nparticular case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that the Member has now clarified\r\n\r\nthat  he was passing through the Woodlands checkpoint\r\n\r\nnot after midnight but at 6 p.m. I do not know why he\r\n\r\nappeared  so keen to clarify about the time.  In  any\r\n\r\ncase, if the Member for Sembawang were to give me the\r\n\r\nparticulars  of  this  specific  case  because  I  am\r\n\r\nhearing  it for the first time, then I will cause  an\r\n\r\ninvestigation to be made and I am sure I  shall  give\r\n\r\nhim a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, before I\r\n\r\nwithdraw the amendment.

She was then  advised  by\r\n\r\nthe  Citizenship  Office to surrender  her  Malaysian\r\n\r\ndocuments to the Malaysian High Commission  and  then\r\n\r\nto  collect  the  Singapore Citizenship  Certificate.\r\n\r\nImmediately   after  she  received  her   Citizenship\r\n\r\nCertificate,   she   went  over   to   the   National\r\n\r\nRegistration Office to apply for a Singapore identity\r\n\r\ncard.  She was then given a temporary receipt at  the\r\n\r\nNational  Registration Office. And,  only  yesterday,\r\n\r\nafter  five  months have passed, did she receive  her\r\n\r\nidentity card. Why was there such a long delay?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, she was issued with a restricted\r\n\r\npassport  granted  provisionally  for  three  months,\r\n\r\npending the issue of her Singapore identity card.

The  verification\r\n\r\nrequires   reference  to  the  issuing   authorities.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  some delay in the issue of the  Singapore\r\n\r\nidentity card to her was unavoidable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with the Member\r\n\r\nthat  it  is not a good practice to verify  documents\r\n\r\nafter  the  grant of citizenship. Since the beginning\r\n\r\nof  this  month,  therefore, this practice  has  been\r\n\r\nstopped.  A  person's particulars  are  now  verified\r\n\r\nbefore he or she is granted citizenship. On obtaining\r\n\r\ncitizenship,  he  or she can now  be  issued  with  a\r\n\r\nSingapore identity card immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have a\r\n\r\nquestion  to  ask the Minister. In 1962 or  1963,  an\r\n\r\nexercise  was  carried out to change  the  old  paper\r\n\r\nidentity cards to plastic laminated identity cards. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  exercise was carried out in 1966.  If  an\r\n\r\nidentity  card  was issued before  1948  and  if  the\r\n\r\nholder  was  born  in Singapore as recorded  in  that\r\n\r\nidentity  card, then he was issued with  a  citizen's\r\n\r\npink  identity  card.  But I  have  received  certain\r\n\r\ncomplaints   from   my   constituents   that    birth\r\n\r\ncertificate  numbers  are not recorded  on  the  pink\r\n\r\nidentity  cards. So when the children go  to  school,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers normally ask their parents  to  produce\r\n\r\ntheir  birth certificates. But the certificates  were\r\n\r\nlost  and could not be produced. Since 1948 the issue\r\n\r\nof  identity cards recognise the proof of citizenship\r\n\r\nas  recorded  in the old cards and we have  pink  new\r\n\r\nplastic  laminated  identity  cards  as  evidence  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship  as  recorded.  So  why  do  our  schools\r\n\r\nrequire the children to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproduce    their   birth   certificates   or    birth\r\n\r\nregistration  numbers.

It is granted depending\r\n\r\non  the situation of the State, and the person who is\r\n\r\ngranted  will not be a national liability. Sir,  some\r\n\r\nyears  back citizenship was so easy to get  that  one\r\n\r\njust had to go through a \"turnstile\" system to get  a\r\n\r\ncertificate.  In  1968 when the British  pullout  was\r\n\r\nannounced   we   were   very   strict   in   granting\r\n\r\ncitizenship.  Now I wonder what is the policy?  Could\r\n\r\nthe Minister explain? Is there any relaxation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are many old people who have been living\r\n\r\nhere  for  many  decades. These  people  have  strong\r\n\r\nfamily background and with children supporting  them.\r\n\r\nThey have applied for Singapore citizenship but their\r\n\r\napplications have been pending for many\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.  I  have the case of an old lady who has  been\r\n\r\nliving  here since 1948. She owns properties and  her\r\n\r\nchildren   were  all  born  in  Singapore   and   are\r\n\r\nfinancially   strong.  This  lady  has  applied   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  but her application has been  \"dangling\"\r\n\r\nfor  many  years. Why is there such a delay for  this\r\n\r\ntype  of a case? After all these people are not going\r\n\r\nto  seek  employment. Their financial  background  is\r\n\r\nalso  sound.  So  why cannot early  consideration  be\r\n\r\ngiven?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister use his good offices to deal with\r\n\r\nsuch  cases favourably and expeditiously as they will\r\n\r\nnot be a national liability in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson has\r\n\r\nagain  brought  up  this point  - that  the  grant  of\r\n\r\ncitizenship is a privilege and not a right  and  that\r\n\r\nthe  main  basis of granting citizenship is that  the\r\n\r\napplicant  will  be  a  national  asset  and  not   a\r\n\r\nliability.  Sir, I agree with him entirely.  However,\r\n\r\nthe  Government policy on citizenship  as  enunciated\r\n\r\nfrom   time   to  time  is  that  the  criteria   for\r\n\r\ncitizenship  are  always kept under constant  review,\r\n\r\nbut  there  is no basic change in the policy  itself.\r\n\r\nSome  modifications have been made over the years  to\r\n\r\ngive  favourable consideration, for example,  to  the\r\n\r\nonly  non-citizen in the family and to  former  minor\r\n\r\ncitizens  who  have  failed  to  take  the  oath   of\r\n\r\nallegiance. In addition the processing of citizenship\r\n\r\napplications  has  been speeded up.  All  these  have\r\n\r\ncumulatively  resulted in more persons being  granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship  last year. A total of 7,806 applications\r\n\r\nwere approved last year compared to 6,347 in 1975 and\r\n\r\nonly 3,989 in 1974.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to applications from people who have\r\n\r\nbeen  living  in  Singapore for many years,  most  of\r\n\r\nthese    people   could   have   acquired   Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizenship years ago without any difficulty  because\r\n\r\nin  those  days  granting  of  citizenship  was  much\r\n\r\neasier.  But  these  people would rather  keep  their\r\n\r\noption  open then, and as such elected to take  their\r\n\r\nchances.  Sir, most of them are therefore responsible\r\n\r\nfor their own plight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson quoted the case of an old lady\r\n\r\nwith property and sound financial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupport.  I cannot specifically comment on this  case\r\n\r\nfrom  the  scanty facts he has given me,  However,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  clear  the air again  regarding  the\r\n\r\nquestion   why  some  old  people  are  not   granted\r\n\r\ncitizenship  even  when their children  are  in  good\r\n\r\nfinancial position to support them. My answer is that\r\n\r\neach  case  should be considered on  its  own  merit.\r\n\r\nHowever, in  all cases where the children  say  that\r\n\r\nthey  are  in  a good financial position  to  support\r\n\r\ntheir old parents, it is necessary to ascertain  that\r\n\r\nthe  children are not only able to support their aged\r\n\r\nparents  but will continue to support them, and  that\r\n\r\nthe  applicant will not become a burden to the  State\r\n\r\nin  future. For example, we must make sure  that  the\r\n\r\nchildren  are not, in fact, making use of this  grant\r\n\r\nof citizenship as a device to dump the old parents in\r\n\r\nan  old  folks'  home, which usually  takes  in  only\r\n\r\ncitizens.  As  a matter of policy, applications  from\r\n\r\nretired  persons  who  had made  economic  or  social\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  the economy are given  sympathetic\r\n\r\nconsideration provided they have strong family  roots\r\n\r\nin  Singapore and are unlikely to become a  liability\r\n\r\nto the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Sad to say.  Sir.  MACU  to-date\r\n\r\nseems  to  be  a  dormant  department  because  their\r\n\r\nofficials   seem  to  be  unable  or   unwilling   to\r\n\r\ninvestigate  and take necessary action  against  such\r\n\r\nillegal martial art clubs. Let me elaborate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Act, only the controlling or national\r\n\r\norganizations  of the various martial arts  have  the\r\n\r\nauthority  to  grade  students,  and  therefore,  any\r\n\r\ngrading  exercise conducted by any martial  art  club\r\n\r\nwould be illegal. However, Sir, there was the case of\r\n\r\nan  illegal  grading exercise reported by a  national\r\n\r\norganization  but  MACU did nothing  about  it.  This\r\n\r\nhappened  when  the  Singapore  Taekwondo  Federation\r\n\r\nbrought  to the attention of the MACU that a  martial\r\n\r\nart  club,  viz, the American School Taekwondo  Club,\r\n\r\nhad   graded  their  students  without  MACU  or  the\r\n\r\nFederation's   approval.  Sir,   MACU   ignored   the\r\n\r\ncomplaint  on  the  ground that the  American  School\r\n\r\nTaekwondo  Club  was  not  a  registered  club   and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  nothing could be done. This is  just  one\r\n\r\nexample but there are other cases which received  the\r\n\r\nsame treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in my view this is simply ridiculous. In the\r\n\r\nfirst  place, under section 5 of the Act, any martial\r\n\r\nart  club  which is not registered with  MACU  is  an\r\n\r\nunlawful  association,  and  yet  MACU  which  is   a\r\n\r\ndepartment  in  the Ministry of Home  Affairs  states\r\n\r\nthat  it  can do nothing about it! Secondly, such  a\r\n\r\nnonchalant  attitude by MACU will only encourage  the\r\n\r\nexistence of more illegal martial art clubs. Thirdly,\r\n\r\nMACU  should be the department of final authority  as\r\n\r\nfar  as the control of martial arts is concerned, but\r\n\r\nthe officials are simply evading that responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, in view of the Government's sports-for-all policy, I would think that MACU should assist in\r\n\r\nfacilitating the teaching of martial arts  as  widely\r\n\r\nas  possible. Thus, I am surprised that MACU has  not\r\n\r\nacted  against  those  martial art  clubs  which  are\r\n\r\nregistered  with  the Registrar  of  Business  Names.\r\n\r\nSports  should  not be a profit-making  venture  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore, business-oriented martial art clubs should\r\n\r\nbe registered with the Registrar of Societies and not\r\n\r\nwith the Registrar of Business Names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am happy to note that for FY 77, for the\r\n\r\nfirst time, there is provision for the employment  of\r\n\r\npermanent staff to man the Martial Arts Control Unit.\r\n\r\nThis I hope will establish MACU as an effective unit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,  may I suggest that to assist the Controller\r\n\r\nof  MACU, particularly on aspects pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nmartial  arts, that an advisory Committee of  Martial\r\n\r\nArts     Organizations    be    formed,    comprising\r\n\r\nrepresentatives from MACU, Singapore  Sports  Council\r\n\r\nand  the national organizations. Such a committee can\r\n\r\nwork  immediately  on  defining  more  precisely  the\r\n\r\nnature  of  various martial arts and  expediting  the\r\n\r\napproval of applications from trainees and coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I explain the position\r\n\r\nto  the  Member  for Serangoon Gardens.  The  primary\r\n\r\npurpose  of the Martial Arts Instruction  Act  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide   a   system  of  control  of   martial   art\r\n\r\nassociations, their instructors and trainees  and  to\r\n\r\nensure that those who learn the art are not likely to\r\n\r\nabuse it. The control of martial art associations is.\r\n\r\ntherefore, achieved mainly through two measures:  (a)\r\n\r\nlicensing  of  martial  art  instructors   and,   (b)\r\n\r\nscreening  of  those who wish to learn martial  arts.\r\n\r\nWithin this broad framework, the Martial Arts Control\r\n\r\nUnit  (MACU)  exercises  the  supervision  over   all\r\n\r\nmartial art bodies in the Republic with, I would like\r\n\r\nto  emphasise, the active support and cooperation  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Sports Council. The Singapore  Sports\r\n\r\nCouncil   is  consulted  on  every  application   for\r\n\r\nregistration   of  a  martial  art   association   or\r\n\r\ninstructor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since July 1976, field officers of MACU have been\r\n\r\nvisiting  martial art associations to  check  whether\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of the Martial Arts Instruction  Act\r\n\r\nand  the  regulations made thereunder  are  observed.\r\n\r\nDuring  their visits the field officers  also  ensure\r\n\r\nthat   the   conditions   of  registration   of   the\r\n\r\ninstructors and trainees are complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens referred to\r\n\r\ngradings  of  trainees. May I explain  that  MACU  is\r\n\r\nconcerned mainly with the background and character of\r\n\r\nmartial  art instructors and trainees and the purpose\r\n\r\nfor  which  the  trainees in  the  art  is  given  or\r\n\r\nacquired. MACU itself does not have the expertise  to\r\n\r\nevaluate the professional\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\ncompetence  of  the  various  types  of  martial  art\r\n\r\ninstructors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to prevent martial art instructors from\r\n\r\nconducting  gradings at will and to  protect  martial\r\n\r\nart  trainees from being exploited, no instructor  is\r\n\r\nallowed  to  conduct any grading  without  the  prior\r\n\r\npermission  of the Controller of Martial  Arts.  This\r\n\r\ncondition.  Mr Speaker, Sir, is stipulated  in  every\r\n\r\ninstructor's  certificate issued. Failure  to  comply\r\n\r\nwith  this condition is an offence punishable by fine\r\n\r\nand/or imprisonment. Permission to conduct grading is\r\n\r\ngiven  only  if the application is supported  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Sports Council which in turn consults  with\r\n\r\nthe  Federation of Controlling Bodies of the  various\r\n\r\nforms   of   martial  arts  and  they   review   such\r\n\r\napplications. This practice, in actual  fact,  places\r\n\r\nthe  control  of  grading of trainees by  instructors\r\n\r\nwithin the powers of the Singapore Sports Council  in\r\n\r\nconsultation  with  the  Federation  of   Controlling\r\n\r\nBodies.  MACU therefore merely acts as a  vehicle  in\r\n\r\nthe exercise of this control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the suggestion by the Member for\r\n\r\nSerangoon Gardens about the formation of an  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee,  we  have already got  this  machinery  of\r\n\r\nconsultation with the Singapore Sports Council  which\r\n\r\nin   turn  consults  the  Federation  of  Controlling\r\n\r\nBodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon:</b> Sir, there have been cases of\r\n\r\nmartial art instructors who have been registered with\r\n\r\nMACU  without  the  approval  of  the  Federation  of\r\n\r\nControlling Bodies in consultation with the Singapore\r\n\r\nSports Council.

This emphasis and the  policy\r\n\r\nare all very correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years the education system has attracted a\r\n\r\nlot of attention and debate in this House. The debate\r\n\r\non  the  education system is aimed at  improving  the\r\n\r\nsystem.   Now   in  order  to  promote  the   healthy\r\n\r\ndevelopment of education, I would like to air  a  few\r\n\r\npoints  in  this  House for the  Minister  concerned.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  will  he consider the introduction  of  the\r\n\r\nfull-day school system by stages? As far as  I  know,\r\n\r\nthere are many schools in Singapore, particularly the\r\n\r\naided  schools,  which  have empty  classrooms.  Such\r\n\r\nschools  can well be converted into full-day  schools\r\n\r\nwhich have many advantages. The full-day school  will\r\n\r\nprovide  more  time  for the students  to  learn  the\r\n\r\nvarious subjects and to produce a better generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe will consider setting up one or more commercial\r\n\r\nschools for those who have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary IV qualifications but are not qualified to enter Pre-U\r\n\r\nclasses. This year there are many Secondary IV\r\n\r\nstudents and because of the 20-point limit for entry\r\n\r\ninto Pre-U classes, those with an aggregate of more\r\n\r\nthan 20 points will not be admitted. Every year a few\r\n\r\nthousand students do not have the opportunity to gain\r\n\r\nadmission into the Pre-U classes. These students are\r\n\r\ntoo young to enter the labour market. They are at\r\n\r\nthis stage about 16 years or so, and they have to\r\n\r\nwait for two years before they can be drafted into\r\n\r\nnational service. So I would urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider setting up more commercial schools to absorb\r\n\r\nsuch students. At the present moment. Sir, the Adult\r\n\r\nEducation Board is running classes to absorb these\r\n\r\nstudents. But the number of classes is too small for\r\n\r\nthe purpose. Furthermore, the Adult Education Board\r\n\r\nis borrowing empty classrooms in certain schools\r\n\r\nonly. The number of classes is not enough to meet the\r\n\r\nrequirements of Secondary IV students. Commercial\r\n\r\nschools run by private individuals are charging very\r\n\r\nhigh fees. Poor families cannot afford the fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to ask the Minister whether he\r\n\r\nis  prepared to relax the restriction on the entry of\r\n\r\nstudents  from  other  countries, particularly  from\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries.  At the present  moment,  we  allow\r\n\r\nchildren  of work permit holders to come to Singapore\r\n\r\nto  study  in our schools. Other applicants  are  not\r\n\r\nallowed,  Since  we have a surplus of classrooms  and\r\n\r\nschool  accommodation and since students from foreign\r\n\r\ncountries have contributed to our education fund,  we\r\n\r\nshould relax the conditions for their entry. This  is\r\n\r\ngood  for them and good for us, because our education\r\n\r\nsystem will be shown to its advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, I would like to ask the Minister whether\r\n\r\nhe  will consider constructing a secondary school  in\r\n\r\nthe  Sembawang part of Marsiling district because  at\r\n\r\nthe  present moment the secondary schools are too far\r\n\r\naway from Woodlands, being in Bukit Panjang. Chua Chu\r\n\r\nKang and Jurong. For students living in Woodlands New\r\n\r\nTown, it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvery  inconvenient for them to travel a long distance\r\n\r\nto  Jurong  and other neighbouring areas. So  I  feel\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a need for a secondary school  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt in the Woodlands New Town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, quite often criticisms\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Ministry of Education have been  heavy.\r\n\r\nBut  then we must accept some of the changes  in  the\r\n\r\npolicies which have been introduced now and again  as\r\n\r\nthey  are  justified because of our country's  needs.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, we shall be carrying on with the  colonial\r\n\r\nstyle  and  methods of teaching, in  which  case  the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Education will be in the good books.  But\r\n\r\nthen   what  would  happen  to  the  other   sectors,\r\n\r\nespecially  when  the students have  completed  their\r\n\r\nstudies from schools and are looking for jobs?  Well,\r\n\r\nthis  is  the main reason why the educational  system\r\n\r\nhas  been revised every now and then so as to improve\r\n\r\nits  effectiveness to suit the country's  needs.  The\r\n\r\npresent  aim in education is to strengthen moral  and\r\n\r\ncivic  education in order to raise the  effectiveness\r\n\r\nof  the education system. So, there should be a limit\r\n\r\nto  the  questioning of our education policies,  like\r\n\r\nthe  learning  of  languages  and  the  teaching   of\r\n\r\ntechnical  education, the revision of the  system  of\r\n\r\nprimary   education,  the  abolition   of   automatic\r\n\r\npromotion  and the introduction of the basic  courses\r\n\r\nto teach pupils to read and write in one language and\r\n\r\nwho cannot cope with the standard course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst we speak about the second language, I\r\n\r\nwonder whether the Ministry is aware of a new kind of\r\n\r\nproblem  we  face  Some schools  are  making  use  of\r\n\r\nlanguage  as  an  excuse to put the Malay  and  Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents into one class while the Chinese are put  in\r\n\r\nthe  other  classes.  Thus, throughout  their  school\r\n\r\nlife,  some  students  may  not  have  a  chance   to\r\n\r\nintegrate   with  the  other  students.  The   little\r\n\r\nintegration  that  we  find in schools  now  is  very\r\n\r\nsuperficial.  This is in a way against  our  cultural\r\n\r\npolicy   of   integrating  all  the  races   into   a\r\n\r\nSingaporean   group.   Furthermore,   many   schools,\r\n\r\nparticularly  the  popular  ones  and   the   mission\r\n\r\nschools, are not teaching Tamil as a second language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese  schools play a smart game. By not  engaging  a\r\n\r\nTamil  teacher, they  claim  that  Tamil  cannot  be\r\n\r\noffered in their schools and thus cunningly keep  the\r\n\r\nTamil students out of these schools. The Minister may\r\n\r\nreply  that  the  response of Tamil students  in  the\r\n\r\nschools is very poor and that is why there is no  pro\r\n\r\nvision for Tamil education. But I would like to  tell\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  that many Tamil students were  refused\r\n\r\nregistration because of the lame excuse by the school\r\n\r\nauthorities that the response in the school for Tamil\r\n\r\nteaching is poor. In fact, the students were told  of\r\n\r\nthis  one  or two at a time. Just imagine,  if  there\r\n\r\nwere 100 students and they were given one or two at a\r\n\r\ntime, the lame excuse of poor response, then how  are\r\n\r\nwe  going  to  promote Tamil language in schools?  In\r\n\r\nthis  way.  Tamil students would be deprived  of  the\r\n\r\nlearning of this language in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the Minister's views\r\n\r\nregarding the posting of teachers to Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nfrom  English medium schools? I have been  told  that\r\n\r\nsome  teachers who were supposed to be loaned to  the\r\n\r\nChinese  schools  have literally been  \"dumped\"  into\r\n\r\nrural  schools  and  they have become  the  forgotten\r\n\r\nones.  Since  these  teachers are  not  happy  to  be\r\n\r\n\"dumped\"  to the rural schools, why not alternatively\r\n\r\npost  teachers to Chinese schools by rotation so that\r\n\r\nthe teachers do not rot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, why is it that some schools, especially in the\r\n\r\nrural  areas,  still do not have  telephones?  Is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  the principals purposely do not request  the\r\n\r\ninstallation  of  a  telephone  although  lines   are\r\n\r\navailable?  If there is a telephone, it may  be  that\r\n\r\nthey will have to every now and then answer telephone\r\n\r\ncalls  from  parents.  That is the  reason  why  they\r\n\r\nrefuse to instal a telephone. I understand that  some\r\n\r\nprincipals of the rural schools do not want to instal\r\n\r\na  telephone  simply because they  do  not  want  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  officials  to contact them  every  now  and\r\n\r\nthen.   In  this  way,  there  will  be  very  little\r\n\r\ncommunication  between the Ministry  and  the  school\r\n\r\nadministration. I wonder how often the Inspectors  of\r\n\r\nSchools  go round to these schools to spot  check  on\r\n\r\nwhat is  exactly happening there. I also gather  that\r\n\r\nsome of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Inspectors do not visit these schools frequently\r\n\r\nbecause of the distance from the Ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to know how often does the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education issue syllabuses  to  schools\r\n\r\nbecause  many  schools  are  still  using  the   1976\r\n\r\nsyllabus, and  not  the current one.  Is  there  any\r\n\r\nstandardisation of the syllabus in schools?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder how the secondary schools, especially\r\n\r\nthe  Secondary IV level, are functioning. We do agree\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a shortage of teachers and  therefore\r\n\r\nrelief teachers are employed every now and then.  But\r\n\r\nthen  some sort of control must be maintained in  the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  subjects  in  the  Secondary  IV  level\r\n\r\nbecause it is more or less a crucial year to decide a\r\n\r\nstudent's  future career. I understand  that  due  to\r\n\r\nmany  problems  in  the school, like  resignation  of\r\n\r\nteachers  and secondment to work on certain  projects\r\n\r\nand  assignments,  the performance  of  the  students\r\n\r\nseems to fall under the different teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a case last year in a secondary school\r\n\r\nwhere just to teach a science subject there were five\r\n\r\ndifferent  teachers teaching the subject.  One  after\r\n\r\nanother came to teach the subject at the Secondary IV\r\n\r\nlevel. There were four teachers teaching one subject.\r\n\r\nHow  can they cope up with the students? This is like\r\n\r\nchanging shirts. However, I gathered that in the  end\r\n\r\nthe  result  of that class in that subject  was  very\r\n\r\npoor.  This is because of the complication  resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  the changing of teachers. This anomaly must  be\r\n\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been complaining that there is a\r\n\r\nshortage  of teachers in schools. Sometime ago  there\r\n\r\nwas  some  publicity for the recruitment of  teachers\r\n\r\nfrom  Britain for our Singapore schools. You  do  not\r\n\r\nget  them  from the commonwealth countries  but  from\r\n\r\nBritain.  How  far  have we been  successful  in  the\r\n\r\nrecruitment?  Have  we managed  to  get  the  foreign\r\n\r\nteachers  to  increase the strength of  the  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff.  Why  are we recruiting teachers from  Britain\r\n\r\nonly? Britain is not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly English-speaking country in the world. There are\r\n\r\nother countries too which are closer to Singapore and\r\n\r\nthey could also be considered. It may also be cheaper\r\n\r\nto  employ teachers from these countries in the  long\r\n\r\nrun. Could the Minister comment on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when is the next promotion exercise due for the\r\n\r\nteachers?  A  few  years  ago  the  former  Education\r\n\r\nMinister said that it would be an annual affair. But.\r\n\r\nactually, the exercise took place only twice  in  the\r\n\r\nlast  four  years or so. It was due  last  year.  But\r\n\r\nnothing  has  happened. Is this going to  be  another\r\n\r\nheartbreaking waiting exercise? As it is, the  morale\r\n\r\nand  standard in the teaching profession seem  to  be\r\n\r\nlow. Is it necessary to make it worse? If you do  not\r\n\r\ngive  them promotion, what interest do they  have  in\r\n\r\nteaching? They would not have the interest to  teach.\r\n\r\nYou  must  give  them  promotion  because  they  have\r\n\r\nalready  suffered  a lot. If you do  not,  they  will\r\n\r\nresign. They would not want to teach. They would just\r\n\r\nask the students to learn themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times the Ministry tends to be slow in dealing\r\n\r\nwith  finance.  I  will just quote an  example.  Some\r\n\r\nteachers  who  invigilated the main  examinations  in\r\n\r\nNovember  have  not yet been paid. Four  months  have\r\n\r\nalready  passed  and  even  the  results  have   been\r\n\r\nreleased. Yet no payment has been made. Why is  there\r\n\r\na  delay? Is it because the Minister for Finance  has\r\n\r\nnot given the money? That is the excuse. The Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance  has not given the money  and  therefore\r\n\r\nthey cannot pay them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what has happened to the `Use your Hands'\r\n\r\nCampaign launched in our schools? There was a lot  of\r\n\r\npublicity  but little activity. Is this going  to  be\r\n\r\nanother  \"Much  ado  about  Nothing  Campaign\"?  Many\r\n\r\nschools have taken this campaign seriously. All  they\r\n\r\nseem  to  care  for is some publicity in  the  school\r\n\r\nmagazines, the press and the TV. What have we  really\r\n\r\nachieved?  What  measures are being taken  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  continuity in the \"Use  Your  Hands\"\r\n\r\ncampaign? But I would suggest to the Minister not  to\r\n\r\ntake  only  the boy scouts to clean the schools.  All\r\n\r\nboys  must help to clean the schools. They say,  \"You\r\n\r\nare a scout; you are not going\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naround  to collect money. Now, you come to the school\r\n\r\nto  clean.\" They have to clean the schools every  now\r\n\r\nand  then. How many days in a week do they  call  the\r\n\r\nboy  scouts to clean the schools. It is very  unfair.\r\n\r\nYou can call them for one day or two days to come and\r\n\r\nclean  the schools. But if you ask them to  come  and\r\n\r\nclean  the schools throughout the week, they  do  not\r\n\r\nhave the time to study?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Victimisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

No doubt at  one\r\n\r\ntime  there  was the \"Use your hands\"  campaign.  The\r\n\r\nchildren must know how to work. I agree. But they can\r\n\r\nwork for one day.

What  steps  are\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to ensure that they do  not  cheat  our\r\n\r\nstudents? Of late there seems to be a mushrooming  of\r\n\r\ncommercial schools in Singapore.

But in this case there  is  a\r\n\r\nteacher  and  there are students, why were  they  not\r\n\r\nallowed to open a Tamil class?

You want everybody to  know  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language in a multi-racial society, a  multi\r\n\r\nlingual society. So you must give the second language\r\n\r\na chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> What is the name of that school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nformulation,  implementation and  promotion  of  this\r\n\r\nbilingual  policy has generally received the  support\r\n\r\nof    parents,    educationists    and    educational\r\n\r\norganisations  concerned.  Not  very  long  ago   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  promulgated its  decision  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nlanguage standard of pre-university classes. This  is\r\n\r\nan  indication  of the Government's determination  in\r\n\r\nimplementing the teaching of second languages. To  my\r\n\r\nknowledge, all the schools are trying their  best  to\r\n\r\npromote the teaching of second language, particularly\r\n\r\nthe Chinese schools, in order to reach the prescribed\r\n\r\nstandard set by the Ministry of Education, I remember\r\n\r\nin 1972 when the bilingual policy was implemented, it\r\n\r\nwas   stipulated  that  the  teaching  of  the  first\r\n\r\nlanguage  in  all the schools should be  75%  of  the\r\n\r\ntotal   number  of  hours  and  the  second  language\r\n\r\nexposure  time  should  be 25%.  And  thereafter  the\r\n\r\nsecond  language exposure time would be increased  to\r\n\r\n33%, 40% and 50% in three years' time. This is all in\r\n\r\nkeeping with the principles of learning. But up  till\r\n\r\nnow  I  have found that the number of teaching  hours\r\n\r\nfor  second  language  in  certain  schools  has  not\r\n\r\nreached  30%.  This  matter is worth  our  attention.\r\n\r\nSince  bilingualism is our policy we must  thoroughly\r\n\r\nimplement   this  policy.  We  should   not   do   it\r\n\r\nperfunctorily. We should not allow the  issue  to  be\r\n\r\ncircumvented.   The  substance   and   principle   of\r\n\r\nbilingualism  should be understood not  only  by  the\r\n\r\nprincipals and teachers but also by all the  officers\r\n\r\nin  the  Ministry of Education in order to facilitate\r\n\r\nthe  promotion  of this policy without aberration.  I\r\n\r\nhave  discovered that in some new Government  schools\r\n\r\nthe   school  signboards  are  written  in  only  one\r\n\r\nlanguage.  Perhaps  this is due to  the  officers  in\r\n\r\ncharge  not  being able to understand  the  bilingual\r\n\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, in order to promote the\r\n\r\nteaching  of second language effectively there  is  a\r\n\r\nneed  for  good  teachers, good  teaching  materials,\r\n\r\nadequate language laboratories and related equipment.\r\n\r\nAccording  to  my  knowledge, in the Chinese  schools\r\n\r\nparticularly  the rural schools in far  away  places,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a serious shortage of good second language\r\n\r\nteachers. I do not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nknow  whether  the  Ministry  concerned  intends   to\r\n\r\nrectify  this situation. As regards teachers teaching\r\n\r\nin  rural schools in distant rural areas, would  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   consider   giving  them   some   transport\r\n\r\nallowance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this year's slogan for the House is \"From each\r\n\r\nhis best; to each his worth.\" This is in keeping with\r\n\r\nthe  fundamental principles of democratic  socialism,\r\n\r\nand  this slogan is applicable to all professions and\r\n\r\ntrades alike, including the teaching profession.  The\r\n\r\noriginal  intention of the Ministry of  Education  in\r\n\r\nthe last two promotion exercises for teachers was  to\r\n\r\npromote  some educationists who were meritorious  and\r\n\r\ndeserving. But, because of certain aberrations in the\r\n\r\nprocess, they resulted in dissatisfaction to many and\r\n\r\nsatisfaction only to some. Some meritorious  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  have  contributed their best whether  inside  or\r\n\r\noutside the school have not been called even  for  an\r\n\r\ninterview. So how do you prevent people from  feeling\r\n\r\nthat \"from each his best\" is useless or it will be in\r\n\r\nvain in their case. So. I hope the Ministry concerned\r\n\r\nwill be more careful in the promotion exercise so  as\r\n\r\nto  be  able to actually carry out the principle  and\r\n\r\nobjective  of  \"from each his best and  to  each  his\r\n\r\nworth\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our school system, there are the principal,\r\n\r\nsenior  teachers and subject directors. They shoulder\r\n\r\nmore  onerous duties and they have to do their duties\r\n\r\nover  a  longer  period  of  time,  particularly  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  who will have to be involved in all  kinds\r\n\r\nof  work big or small, even out of school activities.\r\n\r\nWhether  or  not they have anything to  do  with  the\r\n\r\nschool, the principals will have to be present and be\r\n\r\nresponsible. This is both time-consuming and a  waste\r\n\r\nof  money. The principal cannot even enjoy the school\r\n\r\nvacation  that is enjoyed by the school servants.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past  there was the post allowance  given  to  a\r\n\r\nprincipal  according to the size of the  school.  The\r\n\r\npost  allowance was a kind of award to the  principal\r\n\r\nwhich could serve as an entertainment allowance.  But\r\n\r\nsince  the  1971 restructure of salary  scales,  this\r\n\r\npost  allowance was abolished, This time  last  year.\r\n\r\naccording to the Minister of State, his Ministry  was\r\n\r\nconsidering\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreviving  this post allowance, but it has  been  more\r\n\r\nthan one year now. I wonder whether any decision  has\r\n\r\nbeen arrived on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry of Education has issued\r\n\r\ncertain  syllabuses and notices to schools for  their\r\n\r\nreference,  and  sometimes  the  Ministry  has   also\r\n\r\nconducted courses for school management personnel  to\r\n\r\nparticipate.  This is a good phenomenon.  The  school\r\n\r\nmanagement personnel shoulder onerous tasks.  If  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  want  them  to take part  in  meetings  and\r\n\r\nattend  courses, then they must make sure that  these\r\n\r\nare  useful  to them and have some bearing  on  them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise  it  is a waste of time and effort  if  the\r\n\r\nschool  personnel  do not benefit from  it,  and  the\r\n\r\nofficer  in  charge  in  the Ministry  will  also  be\r\n\r\nblamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of notices by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation to schools is a common thing. However,  one\r\n\r\nshould not abuse this and also it must be ascertained\r\n\r\nthat  the notices are useful before they are  issued.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the notices should be signed by the officer\r\n\r\nin  charge  and not by somebody else on  his  behalf.\r\n\r\nbecause that will be an indication that nobody  would\r\n\r\ndare  to  be responsible for the notices. If that  is\r\n\r\nthe  case,  the Ministry might as well not issue  any\r\n\r\nnotices at all. For, otherwise how do they expect the\r\n\r\nschools to comply with the notices? I hope the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  will urge his  Ministry  to  pay\r\n\r\nattention to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Sir, on 27th December\r\n\r\n1976, just a few days before the current school  year\r\n\r\ncommenced on 3rd January, 1977, the Education Ministry\r\n\r\nannounced   that   Technical   Drawing   and    Basic\r\n\r\nElectricity  would be dropped from  the  Secondary  I\r\n\r\ncurriculum. The number of periods per week  would  be\r\n\r\nreduced from 44 to 40 periods per week as a result of\r\n\r\nthat. This, according to the Ministry, would take off\r\n\r\nsome of the learning load from the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondary I students. No one, least of all me, would\r\n\r\ndisagree  with  the  Education Ministry  that,  where\r\n\r\npossible, we should lighten the learning load of  our\r\n\r\nstudents  provided, in so doing, we  are  in  no  way\r\n\r\nsacrificing  some of our short as well as  long  term\r\n\r\neducational objectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For several years, Secondary I and Secondary II\r\n\r\nstudents were required to do these subjects.  At  the\r\n\r\ntime  when these subjects were introduced, there must\r\n\r\nhave  been good reasons why this was done, or are  we\r\n\r\nto  be  told now that this was not so. If there  were\r\n\r\ngood  reasons then, are these reasons no  more  valid\r\n\r\ntoday? Who are these men in the Shelley Committee who\r\n\r\nhave  come to the conclusion that it is in  the  best\r\n\r\ninterests of the children that these subjects  should\r\n\r\nbe  dropped?  What  is their background?  Apart  from\r\n\r\ntheir  technical  qualifications and  expertise,  are\r\n\r\nthey conversant with our overall educational policies\r\n\r\nand objectives? What is the essence of their findings\r\n\r\nthat made the Education Ministry drop these subjects?\r\n\r\nWhy did the Ministry not release their report so that\r\n\r\nthe  validity  of their arguments and  the  basis  of\r\n\r\ntheir  findings could be confirmed as sound by  other\r\n\r\nexperts  of  equal standing? Why is all  the  secrecy\r\n\r\nsurrounding the Shelley Report?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the move is popular with the parents as\r\n\r\nit will mean less periods for their children to study\r\n\r\nand  worry  about passing the examinations  of  these\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Would the Education Ministry  like  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  popular  with  the  parents  by  setting  up  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  like  the  Shelley  Committee  to   review\r\n\r\nwhether  it  should also drop woodwork and  metalwork\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Secondary I curriculum? Would the Ministry\r\n\r\nconsider setting up a committee to review whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  reduce the load of extracurricular activities\r\n\r\nin  schools? And lastly, would the Education Ministry\r\n\r\nalso  consider  setting  up  a  committee  to  review\r\n\r\nwhether the education system can be less examination-orientated? The Minister may think that  I  am  being\r\n\r\nfrivolous, but I can assure him I am not. The  issues\r\n\r\nthat  I have just raised are issues of great interest\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nimportance  to  parents  as  they  can  affect  their\r\n\r\nchildren's welfare and well-being in schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, may I ask the Minister how much\r\n\r\nmoney  the various secondary schools had to spend  on\r\n\r\nbuying  the  technical drawing instruments  from  the\r\n\r\nSecondary  I students, because the announcement  came\r\n\r\nafter  they had bought the instruments? What  do  the\r\n\r\nschools intend to do with these instruments?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nsupport  what  the Member for Jurong has  said  about\r\n\r\npost  allowances for school principals. I think  this\r\n\r\nissue has been debated in the past in this House. But\r\n\r\nuntil today we have only heard the sound of footsteps\r\n\r\ncoming down from the staircase without seeing anybody\r\n\r\ncoming  down. In view of the maxim \"to each according\r\n\r\nto  his  worth\", I feel there should be some solution\r\n\r\nso  as  to  carry  this out well and  not  shove  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility  to the Ministry of Finance.  That  is\r\n\r\nnot right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another issue. I have found that in the\r\n\r\nimplementation of education policies, it seems  there\r\n\r\nhas   been  an  over-reaction  by  officials  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education. For instance, last year  when\r\n\r\nwe  were  discussing matters relating to the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Education, everybody was saying that the Ministry\r\n\r\nhad  no liaison with the schools. Not long after  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  began  to ring up all the schools  everyday\r\n\r\nasking the teachers to take part in meetings, to take\r\n\r\npart in discussions and so on, all kinds of meetings.\r\n\r\nEven  in the rural schools, in one day alone all  the\r\n\r\nfour  or  five teachers in the school were called  up\r\n\r\nfor meetings, leaving no one to run the classes. This\r\n\r\nis too much. The reaction from the officials has been\r\n\r\nmuch  too  great. This will have to be rectified.  If\r\n\r\nofficials  of the Ministry of Education could  accept\r\n\r\nthe  opinions aired here by MPs, of course, it  would\r\n\r\nbe  most  welcome. But over-reaction is  not  a  good\r\n\r\nsymptom. So I hope the Minister will pay attention to\r\n\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another problem, and that is a personal\r\n\r\none.  In  some schools, there are teachers who  think\r\n\r\nthat pupils must get some private tuition at home  to\r\n\r\ncatch up. I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncould  not  help  it. I have to  look  after  my  own\r\n\r\nchildren.  In  my  own  experience  of  teaching   my\r\n\r\nchildren.  I found that there is no certain  standard\r\n\r\nset for the simplified version of Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Primary I they used the character wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (noon) to\r\n\r\nindicate the wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) in tiao wu ( )\r\n\r\nwhich   means  dancing.  When  my  children  attended\r\n\r\nPrimary II the teacher told them that they could  not\r\n\r\nuse  the  same character to mean \"dancing\",  tiao  wu\r\n\r\nwhich has the same sound as the wu we use in xia wu (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) for \"afternoon\". So one is not sure what\r\n\r\nsimplified Chinese characters can or cannot  be  used\r\n\r\nnow.  So  in the dictation tests the children  cannot\r\n\r\nget  100 marks. When they get home, the parents  will\r\n\r\nblame  the  children for not being able  to  get  100\r\n\r\nmarks.  And if the parents were to ask the  teachers,\r\n\r\nthey would say that it is the parents who have taught\r\n\r\ntheir  children the wrong words. So there must  be  a\r\n\r\ncertain  standard. Which simplified  version  is  the\r\n\r\ncorrect  one? Should it be our version, or should  it\r\n\r\nbe  the  version from mainland China? Or from Taiwan?\r\n\r\n(I  am told there is no simplified writing in Taiwan,\r\n\r\nbut  I  am  not aware of it.) Perhaps this simplified\r\n\r\nform now in use here has come from Nantah. This is an\r\n\r\nimportant matter. This has been bothering the parents\r\n\r\nfor   quite   a  long  time  and  has  eroded   their\r\n\r\nconfidence.  No wonder the enrolment figures  in  the\r\n\r\nChinese  primary  schools have been  decreasing  year\r\n\r\nafter  year, because every school is using  different\r\n\r\ntextbooks.  I  am  wondering, since Singapore  is  so\r\n\r\nsmall,  why the schools are using different textbooks\r\n\r\neveryday. The books are being changed. This is a very\r\n\r\nimportant matter to look into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to\r\n\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang  has  brought  up  several  questions.   He\r\n\r\ntouched  on  full-day schooling, the  setting  up  of\r\n\r\ncommercial schools, and so on. He has even asked  for\r\n\r\na  relaxation  of  rules for  the  entry  of  foreign\r\n\r\nstudents   into  Singapore  schools.  He   has   also\r\n\r\nrequested  for new secondary schools to be  built  at\r\n\r\nWoodlands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  his constituency. So I have to answer his queries\r\n\r\none after the other briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full-day school system is good, I agree. But the\r\n\r\nquestion is whether we have enough schools to run the\r\n\r\nsystem.  If  he thinks of asking those schools  which\r\n\r\nhave  accommodation  or vacancies  and  within  their\r\n\r\nmanpower  resources to run full-day session  then  he\r\n\r\nwill have a lot of problems. For example, for a full-day  \r\n\r\nschool it will start from 9 a.m. and end about  2\r\n\r\nor  3 p.m. That means the students have to have lunch\r\n\r\nin  the  school and this will present  a  problem  to\r\n\r\nanxious  parents. The teachers and the students  will\r\n\r\nalso  come  across  unexpected  problems.  Our  basic\r\n\r\npolicy  is that if a school can cope with a  full-day\r\n\r\nsession   with   its   available  accommodation   and\r\n\r\nresources, well, it can go-ahead if it wants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commercial schools, the Adult Education\r\n\r\nBoard has four centres running commercial classes  in\r\n\r\nthe   day   time.  They  are  at  Kim  Keat   Centre.\r\n\r\nMountbatten  Centre,  Hai Sing Dewasa  Institute  and\r\n\r\nStamford  Girls' School. This year we  are  going  to\r\n\r\nhave  another  school. We now have  more  than  2,000\r\n\r\nstudents attending such classes in the day time.  And\r\n\r\nif  we  include students in the evening  classes,  it\r\n\r\nwill  come  to  about  9,000. Of those  Secondary  IV\r\n\r\nstudents  who  are  not able to  join  Pre-University\r\n\r\nclasses,  some are attending the evening classes  run\r\n\r\nby   the  Adult  Education  Board.  Others  join  the\r\n\r\ntechnical classes in the Vocational Institutes  under\r\n\r\nthe  Industrial Training Board. They go for the  ITC,\r\n\r\ni.e.  Industrial Technician Certificates. So we  have\r\n\r\nquite many outlets for such students. But, of course,\r\n\r\nwe  shall continue to pay attention to these students\r\n\r\nbecause we do not want these people to idle. They are\r\n\r\nnot idling as alleged by the Member for Sembawang. At\r\n\r\nthe moment, we are also studying the secondary school\r\n\r\nsystem. We have said so a few days ago when answering\r\n\r\na  question by the Member for Punggol. We are looking\r\n\r\ninto  this  matter to see whether every  student  can\r\n\r\ncontinue to study until the age of 18 years. This  is\r\n\r\na    long-term   matter   which   requires    careful\r\n\r\nconsideration. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  we  have  to  tailor our  needs  within  our\r\n\r\nlimited financial resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the relaxation of entry qualifications\r\n\r\nfor  foreign students into Singapore schools. I  will\r\n\r\nsay  that the present requirements do provide for the\r\n\r\neasy  entrance  of students from ASEAN countries.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  students from non-ASEAN countries will  have\r\n\r\nto  comply with stricter requirements. Those students\r\n\r\nwho  comply  with the requirements and can  catch  up\r\n\r\nwith  the standards in our schools, we do accommodate\r\n\r\nthem.  Further  relaxation will not  be  of  help  to\r\n\r\nanybody because some of the students may not be  able\r\n\r\nto  cope with our syllabus requirements here. We have\r\n\r\nalso  limited vacancies in our schools. Some kind  of\r\n\r\nbalance  has  to  be struck. At present,  we  do  not\r\n\r\npropose to relax further the entry qualifications for\r\n\r\nforeign students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, dealing with the question of a new secondary\r\n\r\nschool  in the Marsiling area. I would like  to  tell\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Sembawang that we propose to build  a\r\n\r\nnew secondary school in Woodlands New Town but it  is\r\n\r\nnot  in  his  constituency. It is in  Bukit  Panjang.\r\n\r\nAlthough  it is not in his constituency, the students\r\n\r\nin  his constituency can go to the new school that is\r\n\r\nto be built there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has numerous sources of\r\n\r\ninformation and so he has a lot of matters  to  bring\r\n\r\nup  in this House. It is good of him to speak for his\r\n\r\nconstituents, and we pay him all the respect due. But\r\n\r\nsometimes  he raises so many questions that  if  they\r\n\r\nare  not answered will give rise to misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe  Member for Anson has raised 11 points. His first\r\n\r\npoint  was  in relation to the learning of the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage. This is an annual affair, but I can  assure\r\n\r\nthe Member that this is not to be taken as a joke. We\r\n\r\nhave given this matter our serious consideration.  We\r\n\r\ngive  equal treatment to the learning of all the four\r\n\r\nofficial   languages.  There  is  no   discrimination\r\n\r\nagainst  any  particular language. It is  up  to  the\r\n\r\nparents  to choose the language. The second  language\r\n\r\nor the first language is entirely the free choice of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nparents,   and  we  give  them  all  the   assistance\r\n\r\navailable  and  possible. But  sometimes  because  of\r\n\r\ncertain  limitations,  we  have  problems.  We   have\r\n\r\ninstructed  schools  to  accept  enrolment  of  Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents, but whether we have enough students to  run\r\n\r\na  Tamil class is a different matter. If we have only\r\n\r\ntwo  or  three students, we cannot run  a  class  for\r\n\r\nthem.  This is the main crux of the matter. He cannot\r\n\r\nsay   that  the  principal  does  not  accept   Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents.  Probably  it is because  of  the  language\r\n\r\nproblem   that  there  is  a  misunderstanding.   The\r\n\r\nprincipal  may  say  that if  there  are  not  enough\r\n\r\nstudents to justify a class he may not have  a  Tamil\r\n\r\nclass  for the learning of Tamil language.  This  may\r\n\r\nlead  to some kind of unintentional misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAfter  some clarification I hope the Member will  not\r\n\r\nraise  the  matter again next year. I can assure  him\r\n\r\nthat there is no discrimination against any language.\r\n\r\nTamil  is  a  long  standing  language  with  a  long\r\n\r\nhistorical  and cultural background. Although  I  may\r\n\r\nnot know Tamil, which is the only official language I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know.  I  can assure him that  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndiscrimination of any sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point the Member raised is in relation to\r\n\r\nour  transferring of teachers from English stream  to\r\n\r\nrural schools, and forgetting about them entirely. We\r\n\r\nhave  no  intention  to forget such  teachers.  Every\r\n\r\nteacher   gets  paid.  So  we  cannot  forget   them,\r\n\r\notherwise  they  get  no pay at all.  But  there  are\r\n\r\nproblems in regard to transfers. Most of the teachers\r\n\r\nlive  in Housing and Development Board flats  and  in\r\n\r\nthe  urban areas. Many of them do not like to  go  to\r\n\r\nschools in the rural areas. But students in the rural\r\n\r\nareas are also entitled to go to schools. That is the\r\n\r\nproblem.  So  we  have to send some teachers  to  the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  and  we hope that these  teachers  will\r\n\r\naccept  their  transfer  as a challenge  to  shoulder\r\n\r\ntheir  responsibility  as a teacher  to  educate  the\r\n\r\nchildren in the rural areas. Of course, facilities in\r\n\r\nthe  rural schools may not be as good as those in the\r\n\r\nurban  areas. But rural people are more friendly  and\r\n\r\nthey respect the teachers more. I was a teacher in  a\r\n\r\nrural  school some 20 years ago and I know  that  the\r\n\r\nrural people are more friendly and understanding  and\r\n\r\nthere has been no change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  this  attitude. Teachers sent to the rural  areas\r\n\r\nmay  lose  materially  but spiritually  they  may  be\r\n\r\ncompensated for, I hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has also spoken on the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  teachers  in rural  schools.  He  asked\r\n\r\nwhether  we could give them transport allowance.  No.\r\n\r\nwe  cannot give them transport allowance. This matter\r\n\r\nwas  raised  and debated before, and the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nFinance  had  opposed it strongly.  If  we  give  the\r\n\r\nteachers  transport allowance, then  what  about  the\r\n\r\nothers?  Moreover, it is already stated in the  terms\r\n\r\nand conditions of service that teachers are liable to\r\n\r\nbe  transferred anywhere in Singapore. Of course,  we\r\n\r\ntry to be fair but sometimes fairness is very hard to\r\n\r\ngauge. It depends on the stand taken. If he considers\r\n\r\nhimself  weightier than others, then he wants  to  be\r\n\r\ntreated more fairly. It is a difficult problem. So we\r\n\r\nare  trying to find a better solution. The Member for\r\n\r\nAnson says that they can go by rotation. This is  one\r\n\r\npoint  that we have considered. But we have not  come\r\n\r\nto any decision so far. We can only hope for the time\r\n\r\nbeing that those teachers who have been posted to the\r\n\r\nrural  areas  will  be conscientious  and  forbearing\r\n\r\nenough  to consider the educational needs of children\r\n\r\nin the rural areas and continue to teach happily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we come to the telephone in the rural schools.\r\n\r\nSome   schools  in  the  rural  areas   are   without\r\n\r\ntelephones.  But  they form only a small  number.  To\r\n\r\ngeneralize  is  to create misunderstanding.  We  have\r\n\r\naltogether some 500 schools in Singapore but only  26\r\n\r\nschools are without telephone facilities. Of  the  26\r\n\r\nschools,  9  are  in  surrounding  islands, and  the\r\n\r\nremaining  17 are all in very remote areas.  Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  schools could have telephones installed.  They\r\n\r\nare  small  aided  schools.  Perhaps  some  of  these\r\n\r\nschools  feel that there is no need for  a  telephone\r\n\r\nand they do not apply for a telephone. I do not think\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  because they do not want  communication\r\n\r\nwith the Ministry's officials. Telephones are not for\r\n\r\ncommunication with the Ministry alone but  there  are\r\n\r\nother uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About visits by school inspectors. Of course, the\r\n\r\nEducation  Development Officers  and  the  Specialist\r\n\r\nAdvisers do visit all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschools in Singapore. They have a certain schedule to\r\n\r\nkeep; those schools with more problems will have more\r\n\r\nvisits, while the rural schools which do not have  so\r\n\r\nmany  problems will have less visits,  But  they  are\r\n\r\nvisited at least once or twice a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson quoted one example of changing\r\n\r\nteachers in Secondary IV classes. I do not know which\r\n\r\nparticular school or class he was referring to. I can\r\n\r\nsay that, in principle, we advise principals to avoid\r\n\r\nchanging  teachers in the Secondary  IV  classes.  We\r\n\r\nappreciate  that  it is not good to change  teachers,\r\n\r\nespecially  during the crucial time  when  it  is  so\r\n\r\nclose  to  the  Secondary IV final examinations.  But\r\n\r\nsometimes  changes  are inevitable.  For  example, a\r\n\r\nteacher  may be successful in his application  for  a\r\n\r\nscholarship. And we cannot stop him from going  on  a\r\n\r\nscholarship.  As  far as possible we  avoid  changing\r\n\r\nteachers  at  the Secondary IV class  level.  If  the\r\n\r\nchanges  are too frequent, perhaps there is something\r\n\r\nwrong  with the principal. If there was such a  case,\r\n\r\nit  should be reported to me and I will look into the\r\n\r\nmatter  to  see  if I could be of  any  help  to  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  to  put  it right. There  are  merits  and\r\n\r\ndemerits  of  the  individual. It may  be  that  some\r\n\r\nprincipals   have  a  special  reason  for   changing\r\n\r\nteachers; we do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the question of recruitment of teachers\r\n\r\nfrom  England.  England is the  native  land  of  the\r\n\r\nEnglish  language.  Of course, we  do  not  deny  the\r\n\r\nexistence of other English-speaking countries. We  do\r\n\r\nrecruit  teachers  from  New Zealand.  Australia  and\r\n\r\nother  English-speaking countries. But this is  on  a\r\n\r\nshort  term basis, not a long term one. We are giving\r\n\r\nthem contracts of two to three years after which time\r\n\r\nwe  hope  to  be  able to solve our  teacher-shortage\r\n\r\nproblem.  Most of the teachers recruited are teachers\r\n\r\nof  English from these countries. According to  their\r\n\r\nperformance  in  the schools, we can say  that  their\r\n\r\nresponse  has  been fair. Since they are expatriates,\r\n\r\nwe will pay special attention to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About promotion exercises, we have only had two\r\n\r\npromotion exercises in the past\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfour  years. We should have one last year but we  are\r\n\r\nnow  in  the  course  of preparing another  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise. This matter, as mentioned by the Member for\r\n\r\nJurong and supported by the Member for Jalan Kayu, is\r\n\r\ntied up with the consideration for the post allowance\r\n\r\nfor  principals and other related matters.  Promotion\r\n\r\nwill  give rise to the question of fairness  as  also\r\n\r\nmentioned  by  the  Member for  Jurong.  It  is  very\r\n\r\ndifficult to satisfy everyone, and that is the reason\r\n\r\nwhy  there  is  some  delay  in  the  next  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise  which I believe will come up sometime  this\r\n\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On fees payable to invigilators, the complaint is\r\n\r\nthat  fees have not been paid up to this day. If this\r\n\r\nis  true, then something is wrong. As far as I  know.\r\n\r\nfees  for invigilators are paid within two months  of\r\n\r\nthe  examination. I have made some enquiry  into  the\r\n\r\ndelay and have found that some 85% have already  been\r\n\r\npaid.  We have about 13,000 sets of claims to  check,\r\n\r\nAll this checking contributes to the delay. There  is\r\n\r\nno good justification for the delay in the payment of\r\n\r\nfees  for  as  long as four months or more.  Normally\r\n\r\nfees  should be paid within two months, which is long\r\n\r\nenough. Something must be wrong somewhere, and I will\r\n\r\ntake note of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the \"Use your\r\n\r\nhands\"  campaign. I can assure him that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nhas   no  intention  to  get  free  labour  from  the\r\n\r\nstudents.  We never have this intention. The  schools\r\n\r\ndo  not  have the intention to retrench  any  of  the\r\n\r\nworkers either. This campaign is only one link in the\r\n\r\neducational   process  where  we  get   students   to\r\n\r\nexperience the use of their hands. The poor  children\r\n\r\nnever  grumble about using their hands  because  they\r\n\r\nare  used to it at home. Those who are well-to-do and\r\n\r\ndo  not do any manual work at home, however, are  the\r\n\r\ntrue target of this campaign. This is the category of\r\n\r\nstudents  that we want to educate. I hope  they  will\r\n\r\nstart  to  learn something. Let us take Japan  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.  Even  the  children of owners  of  business\r\n\r\nestablishments  have to start from  the  most  junior\r\n\r\nposition  before  they  can be  promoted.  We  should\r\n\r\nemulate this spirit. In our schools, we also have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchildren from millionaire families who do not have to\r\n\r\nlift  a  finger  to  do any household  work.  In  the\r\n\r\nschools, however, they have to be educated on the use\r\n\r\nof  their hands. I hope they will appreciate this  as\r\n\r\npart  of  their education and not treat it  as  being\r\n\r\nused  for free labour, otherwise the significance  of\r\n\r\nthe campaign will be totally lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June last year we conducted the first \"Use your\r\n\r\nhands\"  campaign,  and we intend to  carry  out  this\r\n\r\ncampaign  in the middle of every year in the schools.\r\n\r\nIt  may not be on a national basis but we may ask the\r\n\r\nMPs of the respective areas to help in the \"Use your\r\n\r\nhands\"  campaign  to be carried out in  the  schools.\r\n\r\nWhen  that  time comes, we might ask the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  to  go  to the schools in his constituency  to\r\n\r\nhelp run the campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On private schools, kindergartens and correspondence\r\n\r\nschools,  they  have  to  be  registered  under   the\r\n\r\nEducation Act and they have to seek approval  of  the\r\n\r\nfees payable by the students. We are paying attention\r\n\r\nto this. The Member mentioned the numerous commercial\r\n\r\nschools that are being run on a profit-making  basis.\r\n\r\nIt  is  because they are in great demand at  present.\r\n\r\nThe  Adult Education Board is running more  and  more\r\n\r\ncommercial classes and will provide better facilities\r\n\r\nand  other courses for the public. If members of  the\r\n\r\npublic   still  want  to  go  to  private  commercial\r\n\r\nschools,  it is up to them. It is entirely their  own\r\n\r\nchoice. But I believe the Adult Education Board  will\r\n\r\ngreatly expand its facilities in future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bilingual policy referred to by the Member\r\n\r\nfor  Jurong, I would say that bilingual education  is\r\n\r\none  of  the basic policies of our education  system.\r\n\r\nThere will be no change. But because of a shortage of\r\n\r\nteachers and other problems, some schools may not  be\r\n\r\nable  to  meet  the required percentage  of  exposure\r\n\r\ntime.  This is a practical problem. Ideally, we would\r\n\r\nlike  to see a balance at 50% exposure time for  each\r\n\r\nof  the  two  languages without  a  lowering  of  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of either language, but it is not  possible\r\n\r\n`to achieve uniform performance in educational\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npursuits because different people have different make-ups and linguistic aptitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other point raised by the Member for\r\n\r\nAnson  which  I  overlooked  just  now.  This  is  on\r\n\r\nsyllabus.  He  asked whether there is a  standard  or\r\n\r\nunified syllabus. I would say yes. If he is aware  of\r\n\r\nany   schools  still  using  the  old  syllabus   and\r\n\r\ntextbooks, he should let me know, then I will make  a\r\n\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the question of post-allowance and salaries for principals. The Member for\r\n\r\nJalan   Kayu  has  also  raised  a  similar   matter.\r\n\r\nConsideration  of  this matter is now  in  its  final\r\n\r\nstages, and the Public Service Commission, the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Office and the Ministry of Finance are now\r\n\r\nlooking   into   the   final   details   before   the\r\n\r\nimplementation. So the complaint of false alarm  will\r\n\r\nsoon be proved wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the language of school names mentioned by\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Jurong, our present policy  is  this.\r\n\r\nThe  signboards may be in one language or with  other\r\n\r\nlanguages.  In  newly-built Government  schools,  the\r\n\r\nlanguages  for the signboard will be as many  as  the\r\n\r\nlanguages  used in the school concerned.  There  will\r\n\r\nalways  be  a  Chinese  name for  every  new  school,\r\n\r\nbecause  Chinese  language is not  romanized,  though\r\n\r\nsometimes its Chinese name may not be painted on  the\r\n\r\nwall.  Names of schools are permissible in  different\r\n\r\nlanguages. It is up to the principal to decide. There\r\n\r\nis  no compulsion. For initial painting we have given\r\n\r\ninstruction  to  the PWD that if it  is  a  bilingual\r\n\r\nintegrated  school, then the name of the school  will\r\n\r\nbe  in  English  and  Chinese or  English  and  Malay\r\n\r\naccording  to  the language streams adopted  in  that\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong also raised the point that\r\n\r\nnotices are not signed by senior officials. I have to\r\n\r\nclarify that we have two types of notices to schools;\r\n\r\none  is  notification  and  the  other  is  circular.\r\n\r\nNotification will carry the name of the issuing  unit\r\n\r\nand  the  officer-in-charge, sometimes even telephone\r\n\r\nnumbers   are  stated  for  easy  contact.  Circulars\r\n\r\ndefinitely will be signed and the name of the issuing\r\n\r\nofficer  is  also  stated therein. This  is  also  to\r\n\r\nfacilitate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact.  Whether  it  is really  necessary  for  the\r\n\r\nsenior  officer  himself to sign all  the  circulars,\r\n\r\ndepends on the nature of the communication. If it  is\r\n\r\nso  important or such that it requires the  signature\r\n\r\nof  the  senior officer, then he will sign the letter\r\n\r\nhimself. But if it is a very routine matter, then  it\r\n\r\nwill be a waste of time to make it compulsory for the\r\n\r\nsenior  officer to sign it. Of course, no  disrespect\r\n\r\nis meant to the principals concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Moulmein mentioned that recently the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Education  announced  the  change   in\r\n\r\nSecondary  I  syllabus  by  leaving  out  courses  on\r\n\r\ntechnical   drawing   and  basic   electricity.   The\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned had made a careful study  before\r\n\r\ntaking such action. It was not cancelled just for the\r\n\r\nsake  of cancelling it. As regards technical drawing.\r\n\r\nthis   is   still  taught  in  the  subject  Workshop\r\n\r\nPractice,  but not as a separate subject  as  before.\r\n\r\nFrom our study we found that although it is useful to\r\n\r\nlearn  this subject, the time factor does not  permit\r\n\r\nit  and  the  students could learn them  at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage. This is the main reason why we are doing  away\r\n\r\nwith the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards basic electricity, we feel that it is not\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  them to study it at this  stage.  The\r\n\r\nShelley   Committee  had  considered   this   subject\r\n\r\ntogether   with  other  courses  such  as  metalwork,\r\n\r\ncarpentry and woodworking, and had decided  to  leave\r\n\r\nout  basic  electricity  as a separate  subject.  The\r\n\r\nMember  also  asked  about the  composition  of  this\r\n\r\ncommittee and the publication of its report. This  is\r\n\r\nan  internal working committee, and therefore we feel\r\n\r\nthat  it is not necessary to publish its report.  The\r\n\r\nChairman of this Committee is Mr Shelley and he is  a\r\n\r\nprivate engineer. Another member on the Committee  is\r\n\r\nalso  a private engineer. There is one representative\r\n\r\neach  from the University of Singapore, the Singapore\r\n\r\nPolytechnic  and  the Industrial Training  Board.  In\r\n\r\naddition, there are three representatives  from  our\r\n\r\nown Ministry: one is in charge of curriculum, one  is\r\n\r\nin  charge of technical education and the other  acts\r\n\r\nas the secretary. These are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  who are conversant with the situation in  the\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked two more questions: one is whether we\r\n\r\nshould  have  another  committee  to  look  into  the\r\n\r\nquestion of extra-curricular activities. I feel  that\r\n\r\nfor  the, time being it is not necessary  to  do  so\r\n\r\nbecause  we  have already paid attention  to  matters\r\n\r\nrelating thereto and how to relieve the burden of the\r\n\r\nstudents. The other question is whether we are paying\r\n\r\ntoo  much attention on examinations for students.  It\r\n\r\nseems  that  every student is studying only  for  the\r\n\r\nexamination,  and  he asked if we  could  reduce  the\r\n\r\nburden  of  the  students in this respect,  at  least\r\n\r\npsychologically.  I feel that this  matter  is  worth\r\n\r\nstudying. The series of actions taken by the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Education lately is part and parcel of a policy in\r\n\r\nthis   direction,   such  as, not   publishing   the\r\n\r\nexamination    results   and    candidates'    names.\r\n\r\nConsideration will be given on whether to set  up  an\r\n\r\ninternal committee to study psychological pressure on\r\n\r\nstudents  regarding examinations, and how to  relieve\r\n\r\nthe  pressure. But it is not possible to do away with\r\n\r\nexaminations entirely. At present, there is no  other\r\n\r\nalternative.  I  do  not think  anybody  will  really\r\n\r\nrequest  the abolition of examinations for  students.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  can do is to reduce as far as possible  the\r\n\r\npsychological pressure of examinations on students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about the recent announcement\r\n\r\nregarding   the  schools'  intention  to   buy   back\r\n\r\ntechnical   drawing  sets  bought  by   Secondary   I\r\n\r\nstudents.  I do not have the exact figures  with  me.\r\n\r\nAccording to my knowledge, the number bought back  by\r\n\r\nthe  schools did not amount to more than  500  pieces\r\n\r\ntotalling some $2,000 altogether. But these materials\r\n\r\ncan still be used by students of higher classes later\r\n\r\nand they are not a waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu also mentioned several\r\n\r\npoints. Of course, I have already touched on the post\r\n\r\nallowance for principals which is in the final stages\r\n\r\nof  consideration before any action will be taken. As\r\n\r\nregards over-reaction by the officials in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education. I think it is quite common\r\n\r\nwith the civil service. Of course, I agree that it is\r\n\r\nnot  reasonable to call up all four or five  teachers\r\n\r\nin  one  day from a small rural school for a meeting.\r\n\r\nIf there is such an incident. I hope the MP concerned\r\n\r\nwill  inform me so that I can take steps  to  rectify\r\n\r\nit.  But  he cannot just pick up one or two instances\r\n\r\nand  generalise it on the whole body of  officers  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Education. As we all cherish  self-respect,  so  in  cases  like  this, we  need   some\r\n\r\ndiscussion  among us in order to better  resolve  the\r\n\r\nproblem or rectify the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether the Chinese simplified form wu\r\n\r\n()  of the characters xia wu () (afternoon) could\r\n\r\nbe  used for the wu () in tiao wu () (dancing).  We\r\n\r\nsimplified about 500 characters at the first stage of\r\n\r\nsimplification.  The  second stage  has  expanded  to\r\n\r\ncover more characters. When implemented in full, some\r\n\r\nconfusion   is   inevitable.  On  the  whole,   these\r\n\r\nsimplified versions are borrowed from China as we are\r\n\r\ntoo  small a nation to produce on our own. But  there\r\n\r\nare  a  few  simplified forms  which  are  only  used\r\n\r\nlocally and not in other places. It is difficult  for\r\n\r\nus  to  abolish such local simplified forms developed\r\n\r\nthrough usage, because language is a matter of  usage\r\n\r\npeculiar  to  a  habitat. When the new textbooks  are\r\n\r\nout. I hope they will use only the unified version so\r\n\r\nthat  the  simplified forms will be standardised  and\r\n\r\nthen  there  will be less confusion.  Old  texts,  if\r\n\r\nused,  will of course lead to such problems which  we\r\n\r\nare trying to avoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of different varieties of textbooks\r\n\r\nused  by  different schools, it is again  a  delicate\r\n\r\nproblem.  They all have been approved by my Ministry.\r\n\r\nIf  we  try  to reduce the variety of textbooks  into\r\n\r\njust  two  or three, this will also lead to problems.\r\n\r\nAfter  some  study, my Ministry found  that  at  the\r\n\r\nmoment  we  could not standardise the textbooks.  For\r\n\r\nthe  time  being we are not taking further action  on\r\n\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spoken thus far. I think I have covered all\r\n\r\nthe points raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, the  Minister  of  State  for  Education   has\r\n\r\nexpressed  certain  views and I understand  them.  In\r\n\r\nEnglish schools they say that there are no places for\r\n\r\nTamil  because there are not enough children  wanting\r\n\r\nto  study Tamil. This has been said before and  again\r\n\r\ntoday.  I  think  this  is  not  true  because   this\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  given  equal  status  to  the   four\r\n\r\nlanguages,  and  the policy is that  students  should\r\n\r\nstudy  two  languages. So to say that there  are  not\r\n\r\nenough teachers and not enough students is not right.\r\n\r\nA  circular should be issued to all schools  to  find\r\n\r\nout  how many Tamil students there are and the  Tamil\r\n\r\nstudents  should be told that they should take  Tamil\r\n\r\nas  a  second  language.  The Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nshould take a census to find out the position.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  say  that all schools should teach  Tamil  as  a\r\n\r\nsecond  language. But where there are many  students,\r\n\r\nTamil  should be taught. If you do not give  a  place\r\n\r\nfor  Tamil language, then there is no meaning to  the\r\n\r\nequal  status  of  the four languages.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  adopt this method. It is not the duty of  the\r\n\r\nparents but the duty of the Ministry, because parents\r\n\r\nthink that it is enough if they study any language so\r\n\r\nlong  as they can earn a living. The Ministry  should\r\n\r\ninsist  that Tamil children should study Tamil.  Only\r\n\r\nthen will Tamil get a proper place. I am insisting on\r\n\r\nthis  point. I have a duty to tell this. The Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  not  repeat the same tune and say that  there\r\n\r\nare not enough teachers and not enough students. They\r\n\r\nhave to do something and insist on the Tamil children\r\n\r\nlearning Tamil. I make this request humbly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the Minister of State has said something about\r\n\r\ntelephones. He has said that 26 schools do  not  have\r\n\r\ntelephones.  I  do  not know about  this.  But  there\r\n\r\nshould be a telephone in every school because if  all\r\n\r\nof  a sudden there is a fire, what are they going  to\r\n\r\ndo?  How  are they going to inform the fire  brigade?\r\n\r\nThey  can  do  it only when there is a telephone.  So\r\n\r\nthey  should see that there is a telephone  in  every\r\n\r\nschool. Suppose there is an accident and a student is\r\n\r\ninjured.  If  there  is no telephone  in  that  rural\r\n\r\nschool, how are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthey  going  to  send  the  child  to  the  hospital?\r\n\r\nEverybody  knows that a telephone is  important.  For\r\n\r\nemergency there should be a telephone, especially  in\r\n\r\nschools, because there may be some dangerous incident\r\n\r\nor  there may be some risk of danger. There could  be\r\n\r\nfights and there could be injuries as a result. So if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a telephone they could use it to call  the\r\n\r\npolice  immediately  or the ambulance.  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nwill have to look into this matter urgently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another question regarding promotions. The\r\n\r\nMinister of State is repeating the same story.  Every\r\n\r\nyear  he tells the same thing. He is not implementing\r\n\r\nit in the correct way. I do not know when he is going\r\n\r\nto  implement  it. Only God knows.  The  Minister  of\r\n\r\nState does not know it. Only God knows. I do not know\r\n\r\nhow  they  are going to get their promotions.  If  he\r\n\r\ninsists that teachers should teach properly he should\r\n\r\npay  them  well. Only then will they  do  their  duty\r\n\r\nwell. If a teacher were to do his duty properly,  the\r\n\r\nfirst thing is that he should have courage. But where\r\n\r\ncan   he  get  the  courage  from!  Only  if  he   is\r\n\r\nfinancially satisfied, can he teach properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of allowance. There are cases\r\n\r\nwhere  a teacher has taught for a few months  and  he\r\n\r\nhas not got his allowance. He has given his best.  He\r\n\r\nhas sweated it out and he has taught the students. He\r\n\r\nexpects  to be paid but he has not got his  pay.  But\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  of  State says, \"We  will  investigate\r\n\r\nthis.\" There are 10,000 teachers. How is he going  to\r\n\r\ninvestigate? This is the answer given by  him.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot  joking. These are facts. The teachers should  be\r\n\r\npaid.  A  teacher living in Katong is transferred  to\r\n\r\nPasir Panjang, and another who lives in Pasir Panjang\r\n\r\nis  transferred  to Katong. As far as  possible,  the\r\n\r\nteachers should be posted to the schools in the  area\r\n\r\nin which they live. He has to think about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to satisfy the teachers. Only then will they\r\n\r\nwork  hard.  For example, in 1941. Bevan, the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinister, was a teacher. He said that \"you should  do\r\n\r\neverything for\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  workers\". So he went to the industrial areas and\r\n\r\nmade all arrangements to help the people. That is why\r\n\r\nhe  won  after the Second World War. He  is  a  trade\r\n\r\nunionist  and  he  has  got the  experience.  So  the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  has  to think  about  all  these\r\n\r\nthings.  Why am I telling him this? Unless  he  gives\r\n\r\nall  the help to the teachers, the students will  not\r\n\r\nlearn  properly. Who looks after the children in  the\r\n\r\nschools?  The  teachers. They are looking  after  the\r\n\r\nfuture  nation  builders. So  he  has  to  give  them\r\n\r\nsalaries that satisfy them. Only then will they bring\r\n\r\nup   the  children  properly.  They  will  mould  the\r\n\r\nchildren into good citizens. I hope the Minister will\r\n\r\ntake the necessary action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, today I speak\r\n\r\nin  Mandarin in this Chamber not because I  purposely\r\n\r\ndo  not  want  him to understand me.

Let  me\r\n\r\nquote  what  he  had  said as  reported  in  his  own newspaper, Nanyang Siang \r\n\r\nPau of 17th March, 1977, at page  24. It is reported there that he had said  that\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Education had decided  to  abolish\r\n\r\nautomatic  promotion and because of this  action  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  was  quite  embarrassed   or\r\n\r\nashamed  of  what it had done and would not  dare  to\r\n\r\nface  people  so that it had to resort  to  \"stealthy\r\n\r\nmeasures\".  To  borrow  the  favourite  phrase   just\r\n\r\nuttered  as  coming  from my  colleague,  the  Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State, such statement if  not  answered\r\n\r\n\"will  be rather misleading\". If it is not clarified.\r\n\r\nreaders  might have the impression that the  Ministry\r\n\r\nof   Education  had  decided  to  abolish   automatic\r\n\r\npromotion because the Ministry itself was not sure of\r\n\r\nthe  matter.  As a result, the losers would  only  be\r\n\r\nthose  who  are interested in education.

I  thought  of\r\n\r\ngiving  him  a reply. But thinking that  one  of  the\r\n\r\nEastern  virtues  which  we  are  promoting  as   our\r\n\r\neducation  policy, is to be patient and  tolerant.  I\r\n\r\nstopped   there.  Talking  about  the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation fighting shy of its own decision.  I  would\r\n\r\nsay  that  all our policy decisions have always  been\r\n\r\ntaken only after careful consideration. So it is  not\r\n\r\na  matter of fighting shy or engaging in double-talk.\r\n\r\nWhat  happens is that while a certain policy decision\r\n\r\nis  still  not  ripe  for  publicity,  the  newspaper\r\n\r\nreporters  for their own reason had formed their  own\r\n\r\npicture. So something reported in one newspaper could\r\n\r\nbe  different  from  what is reported  in  the  other\r\n\r\nnewspapers. That is quite common, and it does  happen\r\n\r\nquite  frequently, though not intentional.  For  this\r\n\r\nreason.  I  would not like to touch  on  it  further.\r\n\r\nOtherwise there will be a lot to argue about  without\r\n\r\nreaching  any conclusion. When I first  went  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.

However, these textbooks\r\n\r\nare generally written out of the same syllabuses.  So\r\n\r\nthey  cannot vary too great an extent, except in  the\r\n\r\nstyle of writing perhaps. It rests with the principal\r\n\r\nto decide what textbooks to use.

The Senior Minister of State for Education has\r\n\r\ngiven  quite  satisfactory  replies  to  the  various\r\n\r\npoints raised by Members. At least he has brought  us\r\n\r\na  piece  of good news, that is that remuneration  of\r\n\r\nprincipals would be adjusted for their good and  also\r\n\r\nin  the  middle of this year there will  be  a  third\r\n\r\npromotion exercise for the teachers. I would like  to\r\n\r\nask  whether  he  can tell us more  details  in  this\r\n\r\nregard  because there are still a few  months  before\r\n\r\nthe middle of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of full-day schooling. I\r\n\r\nwould like to air some of my own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nviews here. Many people think that running a full-day\r\n\r\nschool  will help to better the quality of education.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  really so, I think. As it  is,  we  have\r\n\r\nmorning  sessions and afternoon sessions.  I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink  there  is anything seriously wrong  with  this\r\n\r\nsystem.  At  the moment, the students can  use  their\r\n\r\nother session for extra-curricular activities.  I  am\r\n\r\nnot trying to argue for the Ministry of Education but\r\n\r\naccording  to my own personal experience and  contact\r\n\r\nwith educationists abroad, I can say that they rather\r\n\r\nadmire our system of education, with two sessions  in\r\n\r\nthe  schools.  They have been praising Singapore  for\r\n\r\nthe success of its two-session schooling, thus making\r\n\r\nfull use of the school's resources. And they want  to\r\n\r\nlearn  this from us. I am saying that it is something\r\n\r\ntrue.  So  full-day  schooling is only  practical  in\r\n\r\nplaces  where the population is small but  they  have\r\n\r\nlarge  stretches of land where they can have spacious\r\n\r\naccommodation  for that system. In these  places,  if\r\n\r\ntwo-session  schooling were to  be  implemented,  the\r\n\r\nstudents  will  have  to get up  very  early  in  the\r\n\r\nmorning,  say  at 5.30 a.m. or so, or else  they  will\r\n\r\nmiss the time for the first session to start, say  at 7.30 a.m. In these places, there is a long travelling\r\n\r\ntime between the school and the home, so the students\r\n\r\nhave  to stay back in school for lunch and reach home\r\n\r\nquite  late after school. But in Singapore, it is  so\r\n\r\nsmall  that  full-day schooling may  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nbring  any good to our education system. This  is  my\r\n\r\npersonal view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other questions which I think I will avail\r\n\r\nmyself  of the opportunity to ask the Senior Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  to clarify. The Member for Anson has  said\r\n\r\nthat  it is necessary for schools to have telephones.\r\n\r\nI support his view and I would like to ask the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State whether he has any  intention  of\r\n\r\ninstalling  telephones in schools which do  not  have\r\n\r\nthem  now,  particularly the schools in  the  islands\r\n\r\naround  Singapore. Today when I read the newspaper  I\r\n\r\nlearn that TAS could also install radio telephones in\r\n\r\ncars, which have a range of 500 miles. So I feel that\r\n\r\nwe  can use this sort of radio telephone to reach the\r\n\r\nislands where telephone wires are not suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recruitment of teachers from Britain, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  whether the Ministry of  Education  is\r\n\r\naware  of  the  advantages or  disadvantages  of  the\r\n\r\nteaching methods of these teachers. Perhaps we cannot\r\n\r\nsay  that  their teaching method is no good  but,  as\r\n\r\nregards accent. I think it is greatly different  from\r\n\r\nthe  accent of Singaporeans. I have heard the  report\r\n\r\nthat   even   our  principals  and  teachers   cannot\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  English as spoken by  them.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  teachers have  been  recruited  from\r\n\r\nScotland  or  Ireland where the accent is  so  strong\r\n\r\nthat it cannot be understood easily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other issue of official communications. I\r\n\r\nfeel  that  letters or notices to schools  should  be\r\n\r\nsigned  by  the officer-in-charge and  not  just  any\r\n\r\nsubordinate  officer signing on his  behalf.  If  the\r\n\r\nsenior  officer-in-charge signs it  personally,  this\r\n\r\nwill    indicate    that   he   is   accepting    the\r\n\r\nresponsibility. He cannot consider it a waste of time\r\n\r\nto sign an official communication. It is his personal\r\n\r\nduty  to do so. The matter of too many correspondence\r\n\r\nis another matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards school names, since we are promoting bilingualism, it is best that school names on\r\n\r\nsignboards  should  be  in two  languages  at  least,\r\n\r\nparticularly Government schools. Of course, we cannot\r\n\r\nexpect  the  older generation to understand  English.\r\n\r\nBut  there  are pupils who go to a Government  school\r\n\r\nwho  do  not  even  know the name of  the  school  in\r\n\r\nanother  language.  So Government schools  should  at\r\n\r\nleast  have  two  languages  written  on  the  school\r\n\r\nsignboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards simplified Chinese characters, the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  has told us that  we  have  gone\r\n\r\nthrough  two  stages  in  simplifying  characters  in\r\n\r\nChinese.

But I can say there  will  be\r\n\r\nnews about it sometime in the middle of the year.  Is\r\n\r\nthe Member satisfied?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member touched on accent. This is not something\r\n\r\nwhich I can solve. It is a complicated matter. What I\r\n\r\nwant  to  stress is that before these  teachers  were\r\n\r\nplaced  in  the  schools, they  had  gone  through  a\r\n\r\nspecial consultation session with the principals  and\r\n\r\neducation  officers  from  the  Ministry, concerning\r\n\r\nlocal   problems, our  education  system   and   its\r\n\r\nparticular  requirements,  so  that  they  will   not\r\n\r\ntransmit  their own idiosyncracies into our  schools.\r\n\r\nThey  have to fit into our local situation.  What  we\r\n\r\nwant of them is to fill our present need for teachers\r\n\r\nof English language, as we are short of such teachers\r\n\r\nat the moment. There is really nothing much we can do\r\n\r\nabout the accent of any of these teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards telephones, of course, we can install\r\n\r\ntelephones  in  Government schools.  But  to  install\r\n\r\ntelephones  in  schools  in the  islands  is  a  very\r\n\r\nexpensive undertaking. Gradually most of the  schools\r\n\r\non  the  Outlying  islands will  over  the  years  be\r\n\r\ntransferred to the main island. In respect  of  those\r\n\r\nschools that will stay there for a long time. I  will\r\n\r\nlook  into  the  possibility of providing  them  with\r\n\r\ntelephones or radio-phones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards aided schools, the power is in the hands\r\n\r\nof the school management committee concerned. In some\r\n\r\ncases   where   the   installation   involves   large\r\n\r\nexpenditure, it will be difficult to persuade them to\r\n\r\ninstall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, I must say that I am\r\n\r\nimpressed  by  the Senior Minister of State's  reply,\r\n\r\nnot  so much for his answers to the questions but his\r\n\r\ndelivery, which was so impressive yet evading some of\r\n\r\nthe  answers,  and getting away with  it.

As a trade unionist, naturally  I\r\n\r\nalways  welcome any increase of salary  for  anybody,\r\n\r\nbut  I would like to seek some clarification and also\r\n\r\nto  make certain comments. His reply is quite  vague.\r\n\r\nDo  I  take  it  to  mean that  this  will  give  the\r\n\r\nprincipals  a  post  allowance  additional  to  their\r\n\r\npresent  salaries?  Let  me  explain.  In  1972   the\r\n\r\nEducation   Service  went  through  a   restructuring\r\n\r\nexercise.  Many  of  the principals  then  had  their\r\n\r\nsalaries plus their post allowances incorporated into\r\n\r\ntheir present salaries. Do I take it (I mean, this is\r\n\r\ntoo  good  to be true) that in addition to  the  post\r\n\r\nallowances that they had before and which had already\r\n\r\nbeen incorporated into their present salaries, a post\r\n\r\nallowance is being considered? If that is so, it  is\r\n\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, if that is so, what about the\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants? Let me explain, and this is  very\r\n\r\nimportant for morale purposes. Before 1972  when  the\r\n\r\nprincipals were drawing post .allowances, the  senior\r\n\r\nassistants were also fighting for post allowances  of\r\n\r\na  smaller quantum. These senior assistants  are  not\r\n\r\njust  ordinary  teachers. They are, in  actual  fact,\r\n\r\nmanning a school. Because of a shortage of schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we had to put two schools into one  school\r\n\r\nand call them two-session schools. Actually speaking,\r\n\r\neach school is composed of two schools of one session\r\n\r\neach.  So there has to be a person who is the  senior\r\n\r\nassistant to run the afternoon school. Prior to 1972\r\n\r\nthe senior assistants could not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\neven  get  any kind of recognition for an  allowance.\r\n\r\nThey  were  not  asking  for the  same  quantum.  But\r\n\r\nsubsequently  all these allowances were  incorporated\r\n\r\ninto the salaries for principals. Now that the Senior\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State  is  considering  giving  a  post\r\n\r\nallowance  for  the principals, that  is  very  fine.\r\n\r\nWould  not  the Minister of State also consider  some\r\n\r\nkind  of  post allowance of a lesser quantum for  the\r\n\r\nsenior  assistants,  because they  have  to  run  the\r\n\r\nafternoon schools themselves?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Sports secretaries, who would want to\r\n\r\ndo  the  onerous  duties of a Sports secretary  in  a\r\n\r\nschool?  I think it is only fair that they should  be\r\n\r\nconsidered also. The Member for Jurong has  mentioned\r\n\r\nabout   senior  subject-teachers.  These   were   the\r\n\r\nteachers  who  had a post allowance  before  but  was\r\n\r\nsubsequently abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that this is the best news\r\n\r\nthat  the Senior Minister of State has given us  with\r\n\r\nregard  to the post allowance for principals  because\r\n\r\nthey  hold certain responsibilities. But for purposes\r\n\r\nof  morale for the whole teaching service, there  are\r\n\r\nother  categories that he should not  forget.  It  is\r\n\r\njust  like  the  Government  deciding  to  give   the\r\n\r\nPermanent Secretaries a wage increase and leaving out\r\n\r\nthe   Deputy  Secretaries  and  Principal   Assistant\r\n\r\nSecretaries, and so on. This is not good for  morale.\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister for Education go just one  small\r\n\r\nstep   forward,   since  he  has   already   made   a\r\n\r\nbreakthrough  in  this  very  difficult  matter,  and\r\n\r\ninclude a few more other deserving cases? After  all,\r\n\r\nhe  has mentioned that there must be fairness. On the\r\n\r\nbasis  of  equity and fairness, we should  not  leave\r\n\r\nother  categories that merit consideration. I am  not\r\n\r\nsaying that they should all be paid the same quantum,\r\n\r\nbut of a varied quantum. Some form of recognition  is\r\n\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I can only\r\n\r\nreply in this manner. This question of post allowance\r\n\r\nfor  principals has not yet been finally decided.  It\r\n\r\nis  still  in  a  stage  of final  consultation,  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  this  is not the proper  time  for  me  to\r\n\r\nannounce  it. But I sympathise with what  the  Member\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoulmein says, and I shall direct my attention to the\r\n\r\npoints  that he raised. Since he is the President  of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore Teachers' Union, he has  the  duty  to\r\n\r\nraise them. But we must not forget that to traverse a\r\n\r\nhundred  steps  we  can only do  it  one  step  after\r\n\r\nanother.  There is always a step that lies ahead.  So\r\n\r\nit is endless. Therefore, the question is, when do we\r\n\r\nstop?  Once you decide to stop, there may  be  people\r\n\r\nwho  are unhappy. I am not saying \"Yes\" or \"No\".  But\r\n\r\nwhether  we  stop or take a step further, there  will\r\n\r\nalways  be another step ahead. So there are bound  to\r\n\r\nbe   people   who   are  unhappy  in   the   process.\r\n\r\nNevertheless  we  have  to  make  a  start   sometime\r\n\r\nsomewhere.  Of course, by that we wish we could  make\r\n\r\neverybody  happy  but we cannot. If most  people  are\r\n\r\nhappy, that will be good enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Do not get excited\r\n\r\nyet,   Mr   Deputy  Speaker,  Sir.  Originally,   the\r\n\r\nspearhead  of  my  attack this year is  not  directed\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Ministry of Education. When  I  made  a\r\n\r\ndeeper  study of the achievements of the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  over the last one year. I found  that  the\r\n\r\nperformance  is really not bad. But I am particularly\r\n\r\nimpressed  by the performance of the Senior  Minister\r\n\r\nof  State  in  his  manner  and  style  in  answering\r\n\r\nquestions,  which could be said to be  wonderful.  He\r\n\r\nhas  been very adept in avoiding certain major issues\r\n\r\nbut  picking on the lighter ones. He has got the  air\r\n\r\nof magnanimity of a Confucian scholar. That really is\r\n\r\n\"admirable\".   The   debate   went   over   to    the\r\n\r\nParliamentary Secretary to the Minister  for  Foreign\r\n\r\nAffairs, then  to the Member for Boon Lay  regarding\r\n\r\nthe  remarks  made by him, and now  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nLabour  is also involved in the fray. The Member  for\r\n\r\nBoon Lay said that the Parliamentary Secretary to the\r\n\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs was quoting him  out  of\r\n\r\ncontext.  It  is very strange, but the  crux  of  the\r\n\r\nmatter  boils  down to the question of education.  If\r\n\r\nyou  look at the Sin Chew Jit Poh and Nan yang  Siang\r\n\r\nPau  newspapers  you  will notice  that  they  report\r\n\r\ndifferently, even on the same debate in  this  House.\r\n\r\nThis is really a question of education. So you cannot\r\n\r\nsay that the Ministry of Education was doing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthings stealthily and trying to change some system. I\r\n\r\nthink  the  main point is the standard of Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. When the standard of English is  poor, we\r\n\r\nhave  gone  out of our way and taken the  trouble  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  teachers from Great Britain with the  native\r\n\r\naccent of English - well and good. My spoken Mandarin\r\n\r\nis  also  not on par with good norm. But the question\r\n\r\nis,  when  you  have a lower standard of  Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, who is complaining? Where are  we  to  get\r\n\r\nthe teachers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I do\r\n\r\nnot wish to offend them. The question is, if we go to\r\n\r\nthe   Government  departments,  like  the   important\r\n\r\nMinistry  of National Development which is a gorgeous\r\n\r\nbuilding,  we will see this Chinese inscription  over\r\n\r\nthe lift door:() (Dian ti zai bao yang) (The lift  is\r\n\r\nrecuperating.)  This  is  not  Chinese.  This  notice\r\n\r\ntranslated into Chinese does not sound Chinese. After\r\n\r\nsome  investigation I found that the  characters  are\r\n\r\nJapanese,  yet they are used as Chinese and  hung  up\r\n\r\nthere. Every year in the National Day celebrations we\r\n\r\nsee  all  kinds of PA, and other banners and buntings\r\n\r\nwith slogans, written in very poor Chinese, hung  all\r\n\r\nover Singapore. Who is there to complain? How to  get\r\n\r\nteachers  to  rectify it? It would  appear  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Education has to look into the question\r\n\r\nof  poor standard of Chinese in Singapore. The  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  has  said ours is bilingual  education.  We\r\n\r\nhave  to  find  a balance in bilingual education,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  and  must  not implement bilingual  education\r\n\r\nwith emphasis on one language only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of allowances, from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nLabour's  point  of view, I am a little  apprehensive\r\n\r\nbecause we are trying to rationalise wages and not to\r\n\r\nraise salaries indiscriminately. That is the duty  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Labour. If, as the Senior Minister of\r\n\r\nState  has  said, this post allowance is still  in  a\r\n\r\nstage of consultation and therefore not convenient to\r\n\r\ndeal with it in this House, so to both of them I  can\r\n\r\nonly quote the words of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Anson in this House on the 14th March\r\n\r\nabout  how to spend money.

I shall quote  the\r\n\r\nexample  of children who are born deaf or who  become\r\n\r\ndeaf  at  an early age, but I would like to  make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  this is intended only as an illustration\r\n\r\nand I do not intend that any action that the Ministry\r\n\r\ncould  take  should be confined only to education  of\r\n\r\ndeaf children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude of the Ministry seems to be that the\r\n\r\nprimary  responsibility for  the  education  of  deaf\r\n\r\nchildren should be left in the hands of the Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation  for  the  Deaf  which  is  a   voluntary\r\n\r\norganisation supported by donations from  the  public\r\n\r\nand  that  the  Ministry should only  complement  the\r\n\r\nservice  of  such a voluntary organisation.  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat  there  is a place, and an important place, for\r\n\r\nvoluntary organisations in this field but the efforts\r\n\r\nof  such  organisations should be directed  to  those\r\n\r\nareas where the Government is not providing a service\r\n\r\nto  the population at large. For example, we have not\r\n\r\nreached   a   stage  in  Singapore  where   preschool\r\n\r\neducation is provided by the Government. It  is  well\r\n\r\nknown that the first few years of a child's life  are\r\n\r\nthe  most crucial years in the learning process of  a\r\n\r\nchild  and  that what is done in these initial  years\r\n\r\ncan  determine the child's whole future in  terms  of\r\n\r\ncapacity  to learn in later life. This is  even  more\r\n\r\nimportant for deaf children who need to be exposed to\r\n\r\nspecialised teaching at an early age so that they can\r\n\r\nlearn  some  form  of  communication.  Deaf  children\r\n\r\ncannot  learn  to speak, as not being able  to  hear.\r\n\r\nthey cannot imitate sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of the word \"dumb\" with its implication of\r\n\r\nstupidity to describe a mute is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na  tragedy.  Deaf children have often  just  as  much\r\n\r\ninnate  intelligence as other children. Deaf children\r\n\r\nneed to be enrolled into preschool classes at the age\r\n\r\nof  two  or  three years so that they have  a  proper\r\n\r\nfoundation to cope reasonably with primary education.\r\n\r\nParents of deaf children need to be educated also  so\r\n\r\nthat   they  can  be  effective  partners  with   the\r\n\r\nspecialists  in  educating  and  bringing  up   their\r\n\r\nchildren.  There is also a need for special equipment\r\n\r\nto  help deaf children to learn both academic as well\r\n\r\nas   vocational  subjects.  The  public   at   large,\r\n\r\nincluding employers, also need to be educated on  how\r\n\r\nto  deal with and employ such deaf people. All  these\r\n\r\nare  areas  which  are the proper  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nvoluntary    organisations   like    the    Singapore\r\n\r\nAssociation for the Deaf, but the provision of  basic\r\n\r\nprimary education, and for those who make the  grade,\r\n\r\nsecondary  education should be the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a School for the Deaf built with gifts from\r\n\r\nthe  public. It has 20 classrooms capable of handling\r\n\r\n40   classes,  putting  the  morning  and   afternoon\r\n\r\nsessions  together. At present, only 33  classes  are\r\n\r\nconducted and classrooms are empty although there  is\r\n\r\na  waiting  list  of  77 children  for  admission  to\r\n\r\nprimary  school. These children on the  waiting  list\r\n\r\nare  more than seven years old and some are even  ten\r\n\r\nyears old. They cannot be admitted because there  are\r\n\r\nnot  enough  teachers. These 33 classes conducted  at\r\n\r\npresent  are  handled by 20 teachers,  including  the\r\n\r\nprincipal, provided by the Ministry of Education, six\r\n\r\nteachers  by the Social Welfare Department  and  nine\r\n\r\nteachers  employed by the Association for  the  Deaf.\r\n\r\nThe   Association  does  not  dare  to  recruit  more\r\n\r\nteachers  to  cater  for those on  the  waiting  list\r\n\r\nbecause  it is not confident that it will be able  to\r\n\r\nraise sufficient funds to keep these classes going on\r\n\r\na  continuous  basis. In spite of the fact  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   Education  and  the  Social   Welfare\r\n\r\nDepartment  provide three-quarters of the  staff  for\r\n\r\nthe  school,  the  major part  of  the  Association's\r\n\r\nannual budget goes towards the employment of teachers\r\n\r\nin the school. The Association also runs a vocational\r\n\r\ninstitute and I have not even\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntouched on the problems connected with this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore find that, instead of the Association\r\n\r\nconcentrating on those areas which require attention,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  provision  of  very  early  pre-school\r\n\r\neducation,  the education of parents,  etc, which  I\r\n\r\nhave already mentioned, the Association has to expend\r\n\r\nits  resources  on  the provision  of  basic  primary\r\n\r\neducation.  It has, for example, 70 children  on  the\r\n\r\nwaiting  list for pre-school, in addition to  the  77\r\n\r\nthat  I  have already mentioned, for whom it  is  not\r\n\r\nable to provide a place. What I would like to know is\r\n\r\nwhen  is  the Ministry going to take over and provide\r\n\r\nbasic primary education to such children. The parents\r\n\r\nof  such  children are also taxpayers and  I  see  no\r\n\r\nreason  why their children's primary education should\r\n\r\nnot  be  funded out of general taxes as the education\r\n\r\nof other children are funded. It seems a crying shame\r\n\r\nfor children who are already of schooling age to wait\r\n\r\npast  the  normal  age  for commencement  of  primary\r\n\r\neducation because of the shortage of teachers. If the\r\n\r\nMinistry claims that funds are not available for such\r\n\r\nteachers.   I   think   this  would   be   stretching\r\n\r\ncredibility too far as I do not think it can be  said\r\n\r\nwith  any  justification that the  Government  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to take on the complete responsibility for the\r\n\r\nprimary education of such children. The cost will not\r\n\r\ncripple   the  Government.  The  children   who   are\r\n\r\nhandicapped ask no more of the Government than normal\r\n\r\nchildren and they deserve, Sir, no less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Chong Tee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Chong Tee (Changi):</b> Sir,I have two points to\r\n\r\nmake. The first concerns the drop in the standard  of\r\n\r\nEnglish  in  our  schools  and  the  recruitment   of\r\n\r\nexpatriate  teachers. The second point  concerns  the\r\n\r\ngreat number of relief teachers which the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation has recruited in our schools. Although  the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister had already briefly explained my first\r\n\r\npoint, I would like here to elaborate further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate but true that the standard of\r\n\r\nEnglish in our schools has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndropped  steeply  in recent years. According  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education, this is due largely  to  the\r\n\r\npoor  standard of English of the teachers themselves.\r\n\r\nAn  increasing number of expatriate teachers has been\r\n\r\nrecruited  from Britain to remedy this situation.  In\r\n\r\nthe  past  year  alone. 13 expatriate teachers  were\r\n\r\nemployed.  Whether  or not these expatriate  teachers\r\n\r\nwill  improve the standard of English in our  schools\r\n\r\nhas yet to be seen. However. I would like to draw the\r\n\r\nattention  of the House to a number of dangers  which\r\n\r\nwe  may encounter if we employ more and more of these\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, an expatriate teacher may have an ulterior\r\n\r\nmotive  in  coming here. A typical example  is  Brian\r\n\r\nMaurice,  former History teacher at the United  World\r\n\r\nCollege, who was involved in the Euro-communist  plot\r\n\r\nagainst  the  popularly  elected  PAP  Government.  I\r\n\r\nwonder  how  much  distorted  information  about  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and the PAP leadership had  already  been\r\n\r\nfed to his counterparts in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the social values and life-styles of these\r\n\r\nEuropean teachers may have an adverse effect  on  our\r\n\r\nyouth.  Our  youths in primary and secondary  schools\r\n\r\nare still too young to know what is good and what  is\r\n\r\nnot  so  good  for them. If they are exposed  to  the\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  these  expatriate teachers,  they  may\r\n\r\nadopt  the social values and life-styles of the West.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, we are indirectly importing  Western\r\n\r\nsocial  values  and  lifestyles, and  although  these\r\n\r\nteachers  are  engaged  on a short-term  we  may  not\r\n\r\nrealise the harm that it can do to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the employment of expatriate teachers may\r\n\r\ncause  discontent among our citizens  as  it  somehow\r\n\r\ndenies  our  citizens  opportunities  of  employment.\r\n\r\nApart  from the dangers which I have highlighted,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also  consider the cost  of  employing  these\r\n\r\nexpatriate teachers. Not only do we pay them handsome\r\n\r\nsalaries  to  attract  them to our  clean  and  green\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  are  also  paying  them  a  host   of\r\n\r\nallowances,  including return air trips, possibly  in\r\n\r\nour  well-known  airline. With this recruitment,  the\r\n\r\nexpenditure on expatriate teachers is expected to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincrease  by almost 300% this year. Thus, it  is  far\r\n\r\nmore expensive to employ an expatriate teacher than a\r\n\r\nlocal  teacher.  I  wonder whether  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation has weighed carefully the cost and  benefit\r\n\r\nof   employing  expatriate  teachers.   A   continued\r\n\r\nemployment  of  such  teachers  should  be  carefully\r\n\r\nconsidered,  and only when the benefits outweigh  the\r\n\r\ncost. We must spend our money wisely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we can think of the benefits of employing\r\n\r\nexpatriate  teachers,  we must  first  find  out  the\r\n\r\nprincipal cause of the declining standard of  English\r\n\r\nin our schools. Has the Ministry of Education made  a\r\n\r\ndetailed  study of the problem to determine  what  is\r\n\r\nthe  real cause of this decline? We must bear in mind\r\n\r\nthat  besides the lack of qualified English  teachers\r\n\r\nin our schools, there may be some shortcomings in our\r\n\r\npresent  educational system which may be  responsible\r\n\r\nfor  the poor standard of English. Perhaps, the rapid\r\n\r\nchanges  in  the educational policy in  recent  years\r\n\r\nhave  caused  confusion among teachers and  students.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our youths in schools may not be able to\r\n\r\nadapt  themselves to such rapid changes.  Hence, the\r\n\r\ndecline  in the standard of education in general  and\r\n\r\nEnglish in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our method of examination may also be a cause for\r\n\r\nthe  declining standard of English. In schools,  both\r\n\r\nteachers  and students are examination-oriented.  The\r\n\r\nstudent's  main concern is to pass the  examinations.\r\n\r\nLittle  thought is given to improving both  oral  and\r\n\r\nwritten  English. Presently, more emphasis is  placed\r\n\r\non technical education to satisfy the requirements of\r\n\r\nour  industries. Possibly, this is another cause  for\r\n\r\nour declining standard of English. More resources are\r\n\r\nchannelled   into   the  development   of   technical\r\n\r\neducation,  which over-rides the object of  improving\r\n\r\nthe standard of English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having given the number of possible causes for\r\n\r\nthe present state of affairs, I hope the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  would  look into them more  deeply  before\r\n\r\nmaking any justification for the recruitment of  more\r\n\r\nand more expatriate teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the employment of expatriate\r\n\r\nteachers  is  the  only  solution  to  this  critical\r\n\r\nproblem.  I  am all for the employment of  expatriate\r\n\r\nteachers  to help us improve the standard of  English\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  if  this is the only solution  to  our\r\n\r\nproblem  and  if  the commitment of these  expatriate\r\n\r\nteachers in our Republic are not prejudicial  to  the\r\n\r\nwelfare  of our people and the security of Singapore.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, has the Government thought of  sending\r\n\r\nour teachers to Britain for training? If our teachers\r\n\r\ncan  be trained to do the work as efficiently as  the\r\n\r\nexpatriate  teachers, then I see  no  reason  why  we\r\n\r\nshould  employ them from overseas, particularly  from\r\n\r\nBritain  which  the Member for Anson  has  mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis will be cost-saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I would like to raise is the\r\n\r\nshortage  of teachers, which warrants the  employment\r\n\r\nof  many  relief  teachers. If  relief  teachers  are\r\n\r\nrequired to cover teachers who go on maternity leave,\r\n\r\nnational  service, and on annual study leave, is  it\r\n\r\nnot possible for the Ministry of Education to form  a\r\n\r\npool   of  relief  teachers?  The  number  of  relief\r\n\r\nteachers  is  quite substantial, so  they  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven  proper training at the Institute of Education.\r\n\r\nSince the future of our children lies in their hands,\r\n\r\nit is absolutely essential that these relief teachers\r\n\r\nare  offered proper training so that they can perform\r\n\r\ntheir  duties  more  effectively. I  understand  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  some  teachers who have  completed  their\r\n\r\ntraining in the Institute of Education but are  still\r\n\r\nemployed  as  relief teachers. Some of them  have  to\r\n\r\nwork  for  a period of two to three years  as  relief\r\n\r\nteachers before they are offered permanent posts. Why\r\n\r\nis  this  so?  In  spite  of the  acute  shortage  of\r\n\r\nteaching  staff  in schools, why are these  qualified\r\n\r\nteachers  not  considered  for  permanent  employment\r\n\r\nimmediately  after graduating from the  Institute  of\r\n\r\nEducation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.
