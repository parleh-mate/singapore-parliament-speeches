Dr Lee\r\n\r\nBoon Yang.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nyesterday,  just  before the moment of interruption,  Mr  Low\r\n\r\nThia Khiang raised several supplementary queries.  Thank  you\r\n\r\nfor allowing me the opportunity to respond to him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked what is the scale of the problem of the older\r\n\r\nworkers.  Overall, we have about 330,000 workers who are aged\r\n\r\n40 and above and who also have less than secondary education.\r\n\r\nSo  this is the group that we are focusing on - older, lower-educated  workers.  The unemployment rate for this  group  of\r\n\r\nolder  and lower-educated workers is about 3%, which is close\r\n\r\nto the resident unemployment rate of 3.4%.  But the fact that\r\n\r\ntheir   unemployment  rate  is  lower   than   the   resident\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate of 3.4% is no cause for comfort  actually,\r\n\r\nbecause this is the group that is, in fact, vulnerable as the\r\n\r\neconomy  continues to restructure.  At this age,  with  their\r\n\r\nlow  skills,  if  they  should lose  their  jobs,  they  face\r\n\r\nincreasing difficulty getting re-employed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at the end of last year, as I mentioned yesterday,\r\n\r\nabout  40,000 people had undergone training under the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment  Programme.  The Member said  that  he  thought\r\n\r\nonly  about 23% of them are the older workers.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  point  out  that,  out of these 40,000  people  who  have\r\n\r\nundergone SRP training, about 30% are aged 40 and above.  But\r\n\r\nthis, again, is also not representative because, in fact, the\r\n\r\ngroup  of workers who are aged 40 and above represents  about\r\n\r\n45% of the resident workforce.  So they are, in effect, under-represented in the SRP training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member finally asked whether we are satisfied with\r\n\r\nthe  response of older workers to our call to go  for  skills\r\n\r\nupgrading.   The answer is no.  We want to see more  of  them\r\n\r\ncoming forward to undergo skills training and retraining,  so\r\n\r\nthat  they  can be better prepared for the changes  that  are\r\n\r\nwaiting for us, ie, the changes that are bound to come.  That\r\n\r\nis  why  the  Government  has allocated  more  resources  for\r\n\r\nmanpower development.  In our programmes - whether it is  the\r\n\r\nSkills  Redevelopment Programme, National Skills  Recognition\r\n\r\nSystem or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  the new programmes that we will introduce as  part  of\r\n\r\nthe  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund -  we  will  focus  on\r\n\r\nprogrammes and activities that will enable more of the lower-skilled  and  older workers to upgrade their skills  so  that\r\n\r\nthey can be better prepared for the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I have your\r\n\r\npermission to seek one clarification?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> One last question. We are running out of\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I would like to know from the\r\n\r\nMinister  whether or not enough efforts have  been  put  into\r\n\r\nreaching this group of workers to take up the skills training\r\n\r\nor re-employment opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, we are putting a tremendous\r\n\r\namount of resources into this area of upgrading the skills of\r\n\r\nthe  older  workers.   We work very closely  with  the  trade\r\n\r\nunions  and the employers to ensure that the older  group  of\r\n\r\nworkers  is  well  informed of the various  skills  upgrading\r\n\r\nopportunities  available to it.  But I would  also  reiterate\r\n\r\nthat we will continue to put in more effort, and we need more\r\n\r\neffort, to reach out to this group.  We also need the support\r\n\r\nof  community  groups to help us to spread the  message  that\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading  is important, in order to  cope  with  the\r\n\r\nchanges in the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I would like to speak\r\n\r\non the issue of foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I empathise with, and support, the Minister for\r\n\r\nManpower  when  he  said yesterday that  Singapore  needs  to\r\n\r\nwelcome  foreign  talent even while we search  for  more  and\r\n\r\nbetter  ways  of enhancing the employability of our  workers.\r\n\r\nLet  me  state  at  the  outset that I support  the  existing\r\n\r\nforeign  talent and foreign worker policies.  We  need  these\r\n\r\nguest  workers in order to enlarge the economic pie  for  our\r\n\r\npeople as we are short of workers to enjoy sustained\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neconomic  growth.  I maintain, however, that in some  sectors\r\n\r\nand  industries, the Ministry should encourage more companies\r\n\r\nto  redesign job functions so that our older workers can take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the available jobs, instead of taking  the  easy\r\n\r\nway  out by bringing in foreign workers, especially after our\r\n\r\nown  workers  have gained new skills that may be relevant  to\r\n\r\nour companies in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, foreign workers form a section of\r\n\r\nour  working population whom we sometimes forget, even though\r\n\r\nwe  see and interact with them on a daily basis.  They  clean\r\n\r\nour  neighbourhoods,  and  work on  our  factory  floors  and\r\n\r\nconstruction  sites.  In fact, about 100,000 households  host\r\n\r\nthem  as domestic helpers, who cook and wash for our families\r\n\r\nand  mind our children.  For the contribution that they  have\r\n\r\nmade to our prosperity and well-being, we must, as a society,\r\n\r\ntake  care  of the welfare of foreign workers, who  now  form\r\n\r\nabout 1/4 of our workforce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a union official, I would say that my views on\r\n\r\nthis matter have largely been shaped by the social mission of\r\n\r\nthe labour movement, which is led by NTUC, in taking care  of\r\n\r\nthe  welfare of workers here, both local and foreign.   While\r\n\r\nthe  majority  of employers treat the foreign  workers  well,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  there remains a small minority  of  employers\r\n\r\nand  employment agencies who mistreat and abuse their foreign\r\n\r\nemployees,  through  physical  abuse,  breach  of  previously\r\n\r\nagreed  terms  and conditions, and the lack of  proper  basic\r\n\r\namenities  like housing.  Foreign workers must  be  protected\r\n\r\nagainst   such  errant  employers  and  employment  agencies.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a civilised nation where morality and  the  rule\r\n\r\nof  law prevail.  We have a responsibility to defend the poor\r\n\r\nand the helpless amongst us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report published yesterday by the newspaper,\r\n\r\nToday,  brings  to  light some of the problems  that  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in Singapore face.  Entitled \"Exploiting the  Weak\",\r\n\r\nit  brings  to  mind  the problems that unsuspecting  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers may face when they come to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  is  true  that  some  of  these  abuses  and\r\n\r\nmistreatment  may  have started right in their  home  country\r\n\r\nbut,  all  the  same,  Sir,  we must  ensure  that  those  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who abuse and mistreat the foreign workers  should\r\n\r\nbe  taken  to  task.  I would like to ask the Minister  about\r\n\r\ndisputes  involving  foreign  workers  and  action  taken  on\r\n\r\nemployers  who had mistreated their workers in the  past  one\r\n\r\nyear at least, whether there has been a large increase in the\r\n\r\nnumber   of   complaints  against  employers  and  employment\r\n\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am aware that MOM has proper channels for foreign\r\n\r\nworkers seeking redress against abuses.  I have also read  in\r\n\r\nthe press that penalties against abusive employers and errant\r\n\r\nemployment agencies have been stiffened.  These measures  are\r\n\r\nlaudable.   But I would like to put the issue into a  sharper\r\n\r\nfocus by suggesting to the Ministry of Manpower that the  law\r\n\r\nshould  discriminate clearly the instances where the  foreign\r\n\r\nworker may have unknowingly broken the law.  The law must  be\r\n\r\nunambiguous against offenders.  The law should also take into\r\n\r\nconsideration   that  foreign  workers  who,  for   instance,\r\n\r\noverstay  may have done so because their passports were  kept\r\n\r\nby  their  employment agencies or their employers.  In  these\r\n\r\ninstances,  the  law must also punish the  employers  or  the\r\n\r\nemployment  agencies  that are responsible  for  leaving  the\r\n\r\nforeign workers stranded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign domestic workers, in particular, may be at the\r\n\r\nmercy of employment agencies that find opportunities to  levy\r\n\r\nexorbitant fees on these foreign workers.  I acknowledge that\r\n\r\nsome  of the cheating could have been committed in their home\r\n\r\ncountry, even before the foreign worker set foot on our soil.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Ministry of Manpower should monitor this  matter\r\n\r\nclosely, because the recruitment fees are levied on them when\r\n\r\nthey  first  take  up  a  new assignment  in  Singapore.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  if  they change employers, or are  repatriated  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own countries, they could be asked to pay unreasonably\r\n\r\nhigh administrative charges to the employment agencies.  Yes,\r\n\r\nwe  can  say  this is a case of \"willing buyers  and  willing\r\n\r\nsellers\" of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservices here, but the Ministry should conduct regular checks\r\n\r\non maid agencies which charge prospective employers a low fee\r\n\r\nand  then pass the cost of recruitment to the maids  who  may\r\n\r\nnot  get  their full salary.  In fact, they may get  even  as\r\n\r\nlittle as $10 for as long as six months, because they have to\r\n\r\nrepay the fee to the agency through the employer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this light, may I request the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower  for an update of the measures taken to  ensure  the\r\n\r\nprotection  of  foreign domestic workers in  particular,  and\r\n\r\nwork  permit holders in general.  I understand that MOM  has,\r\n\r\nas of 1998, required employment agencies to attend a training\r\n\r\ncourse  at  the  Singapore  Polytechnic  before  giving  them\r\n\r\napproval  to  recruit foreign workers.   May  I  request  the\r\n\r\nManpower Minister for his views on the usefulness of  such  a\r\n\r\ncourse and whether it has produced the desired results.   Can\r\n\r\nthe Minister consider subsidising the training of maids here?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Hawazi, can I ask you to shorten your\r\n\r\nspeech?  We are running very far behind time and I intend  to\r\n\r\ndrop  the  \"guillotine\" on this Head  strictly  at  1.28  pm,\r\n\r\nregardless  of  whether there are any  Members  who  wish  to\r\n\r\nspeak, in order that we can proceed to the other amendments.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, let me just conclude by saying\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  a  large number of foreign  workers  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction  industry.  I would like  to  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether  we  have peculiar problems in the industry  that  we\r\n\r\nshould address.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, there are\r\n\r\nindustries  that  are  highly reliant  on  unskilled  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.   Many  Singaporeans complain that  because  of  the\r\n\r\nimportation  of  cheap labour, they have  been  displaced  by\r\n\r\nthese  lower-paid foreign workers.  My residents  in  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  constituency are also frustrated with the  congregation\r\n\r\nof  foreign workers in the HDB housing estates at Beach  Road\r\n\r\nand Rowell Court.  These unskilled foreign workers bring with\r\n\r\nthem bad social habits and behaviour.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, employers must be asked to upgrade their operations\r\n\r\nto reduce reliance on unskilled foreign workers.  The foreign\r\n\r\nworker  levy  is  one  useful tool,  but  we  must  also  ask\r\n\r\nemployers  to provide better accommodation and other  welfare\r\n\r\namenities.   I  would like to ask the Minister  for  Manpower\r\n\r\nwhat  steps  are  taken to reduce the reliance  on  unskilled\r\n\r\nforeign workers, to provide the opportunities for Singaporean\r\n\r\nworkers,  without compromising and affecting the  ability  of\r\n\r\nour  factories and the manufacturing service sectors to  meet\r\n\r\nthe manpower needs of the economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another category of foreign workers are the maids. I am\r\n\r\nconcerned with the declining quality of the maids coming from\r\n\r\nfar away provinces, and what steps are taken to improve their\r\n\r\nquality and training.  Is it possible now to allow management\r\n\r\ncorporations in condominiums to be employers of maids so that\r\n\r\nthey can be better utilised?\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in addition\r\n\r\nto  the points made earlier, I would like to ask the Minister\r\n\r\nto  review  the way in which foreign workers are brought  in.\r\n\r\nThe  present  system of using agents is exploitative  because\r\n\r\nworkers come in, with promises and hopes, and they sold their\r\n\r\nproperty, borrowed huge sums of money to come in, just to get\r\n\r\nout  of  the poverty trap.  The agents make money by bringing\r\n\r\nthe  workers in, so the more workers they bring in, the  more\r\n\r\nmoney they make and, therefore, they try to bring in workers,\r\n\r\neven illegally.  This is treating people like a commodity  as\r\n\r\nwith  other goods and services, which is not appropriate with\r\n\r\nthe civilised nature of our society.  Can we work out ways to\r\n\r\nby-pass  agents, or at least make it difficult for agents  to\r\n\r\nprofiteer from treating humans as a commodity?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few days ago, I heard that there are big\r\n\r\ncompanies  which are allocated foreign workers and when  they\r\n\r\ndo not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  work, they send them to other people and collect money,\r\n\r\nor  just  to  ask them to do their work. And sometimes,  when\r\n\r\ntheir  work permits expire, the workers do not know about  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they do not have their passports with them and  they\r\n\r\nare  considered illegal immigrants, if they are  caught,  and\r\n\r\nthe  other  employers are also in trouble.   So  we  need  to\r\n\r\ntighten up this allocation arrangement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that generally the living conditions of our\r\n\r\nforeign  workers have improved.  When you go to  construction\r\n\r\nsites,  their  housing  conditions have  improved.   Quite  a\r\n\r\nnumber   of  employers  have  also  improved  their   housing\r\n\r\nconditions,  which  are positive.  But there  are  also  many\r\n\r\nworkers   here   who  do  not  know  of  their   rights   and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities, including those on employment  pass.   They\r\n\r\ncome here on contracts, and when their terms and salaries are\r\n\r\nchanged,  they  cannot  do very much.   And  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nearning above a certain salary have difficulties in getting a\r\n\r\nredress.   Maybe  we  should also try to apply  ourselves  to\r\n\r\nsolve  this  problem.  Just as we were  able  to  reduce  the\r\n\r\naccident rate of foreign workers in construction sites, I  am\r\n\r\nsure if we put in the effort, there would be results.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like the Minister to review the way foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  are sent back.  Nowadays, it is very easy.  Somebody\r\n\r\njust  has to cancel the work permit and the worker goes back.\r\n\r\nOn  a number of times, we read that they protest because they\r\n\r\nsaid  they  have not been paid their wages, that are  due  to\r\n\r\nthem.  Could we have a better check and balance so  that,  at\r\n\r\nleast,  the employers do not exploit them and send them  away\r\n\r\nand save money?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point that I would like to make is that I am\r\n\r\nvery  happy  that the Minister, in his reply yesterday,  said\r\n\r\nthat  he  would  be  making sure that the number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  coming in would be controlled so as not  to  deprive\r\n\r\nour workers of jobs.  This is particularly necessary when  we\r\n\r\nhave  such a high number of unskilled older workers.  I think\r\n\r\nwe  should  make sure that our local wages are not  depressed\r\n\r\nand our terms and conditions of employment are not lessened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San):</b> Sir, with globalisation\r\n\r\nand  rapid  economic reform, the Ministry of Manpower  should\r\n\r\nhelp industries that are heavily dependent on foreign workers\r\n\r\nto   reduce  its  dependency  by  raising  productivity,  and\r\n\r\nencourage  these  industries to adopt innovative  methods  to\r\n\r\nredesign and re-engineer the work processes. We will have  to\r\n\r\nimport more foreign workers if we do not restructure our work\r\n\r\nprocesses  and redesign our jobs fast.  Today, the number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers in Singapore is very large.  We  have  about\r\n\r\n500,000  foreign workers, including 140,000 foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nmaids.   We  should  substantively reduce our  dependence  on\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know what plans does the Ministry have\r\n\r\nto  facilitate job redesign and re-engineering  and  how  the\r\n\r\nManpower  Development Assistance Scheme  (MDAS)  can  support\r\n\r\nsuch  initiatives  and  how  the  Man-Year-Entitlement  (MYE)\r\n\r\nsystem has helped address the issue of foreign workers in the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector.  Has it helped to redress the  issue  of\r\n\r\nemployers  taking advantage of our foreign  workers,  ie,  to\r\n\r\nstop  the  illegal  employment practices and  abuses  in  the\r\n\r\nconstruction sector?  Would the Ministry consider  shortening\r\n\r\nthe  time-frame in tightening the MYE further?  The  Ministry\r\n\r\nshould  also  review  the  present  work  permit  allocations\r\n\r\nsystem,  such as changing the existing sectoral approach  and\r\n\r\nre-classifying the foreign workers' needs and entitlement  of\r\n\r\nthe various industries by their job requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, according to\r\n\r\nstatistics,  we have more than 900,000 families in  Singapore\r\n\r\nemploying  a total of more than 140,000 foreign maids.  There\r\n\r\nis a necessity for us to seriously look into this matter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are so many foreign maids in Singapore, what\r\n\r\nkind  of  social influence would they assert on our  society?\r\n\r\nJust  like our highway system, I do not think we should fully\r\n\r\ndepend on the ERP to control\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nour  traffic  flow.   I  think  MOM  should  also  have  some\r\n\r\neffective  measures  to  check  this  dependency  on  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  and  not  depend entirely on the  mechanism  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  levy  to check our people's  dependency  on\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should also review the foreign workers levy.\r\n\r\nThis  is  very  important because the  foreign  workers  levy\r\n\r\nserves  the  purpose of balancing our workforce in Singapore,\r\n\r\nso  that the cost of employing foreign workers is not too far\r\n\r\nbelow from the cost of employing local workers. Otherwise, we\r\n\r\nwould  not  be  able to prevent the employers from  employing\r\n\r\nthese  cheaper  foreign workers, and at the same  time  exert\r\n\r\npressure on the wages of our local workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we relax the levy on foreign workers, the employers\r\n\r\ndo  not  share the savings with their workers.  I  understand\r\n\r\nthat  most workers are given just  $30 to $40 extra by  their\r\n\r\nemployers.   As a result, there is a big difference of a  few\r\n\r\nhundred  dollars  between  the wages  of  the  local  skilled\r\n\r\nworkers  and those of the  foreign skilled workers.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  something could be done about this matter so  that,  on\r\n\r\none  hand, the welfare of the foreign workers could be looked\r\n\r\ninto,  and on the other hand, the difference in wages between\r\n\r\nthe local workers and foreign workers will not be widened.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, last November,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  said that he shall review the foreign  workers\r\n\r\nand  foreign domestic maids levies, depending on the economic\r\n\r\nclimate this year.  By the generous give-away and the cut  on\r\n\r\ntax  rate, the Government, has, in fact, signalled that there\r\n\r\nmay  be  an economic downturn this year.  So, it is also  not\r\n\r\nwrong  for  the Minister to think likewise and cut  the  levy\r\n\r\nrates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current levy rates for workers range from $30-$470\r\n\r\nper  month.   The  levy for maids stands at $345  per  month.\r\n\r\nThese  rates  are a burden on the SMEs and on the housewives.\r\n\r\nThere  has been much talk of our SMEs finding it tough to  do\r\n\r\nbusiness,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npartly  due  to  the  high fees and  levies  imposed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Minister should review the workers levy  and\r\n\r\nsee  whether  he can reduce them to help our SMEs  tide  over\r\n\r\nthis  lull period.  As for the working mothers, the  Minister\r\n\r\nwithout  Portfolio said that they enjoy double  tax  reliefs,\r\n\r\nwhich   can   be   offset  by  domestic  maid   levy.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, this relief is not enjoyed by single  fathers,\r\n\r\nand  I believe, also single mothers.  Sir, there shall  be  a\r\n\r\nsurplus  and  I do not see why the Government  is  not  in  a\r\n\r\nposition to reduce these levies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in particular, the maid levy is a hardship for\r\n\r\nworking  mothers.  Many working mothers go out to  work,  not\r\n\r\nout  of  choice, but are forced to do so because of the  high\r\n\r\ncost of living. They have to work to supplement the household\r\n\r\nincome, otherwise, they cannot make ends meet.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also ask the Minister to review whether tax\r\n\r\nrelief on maid levy can be given to single working mothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, since there is really not much\r\n\r\ntime  left, I would have to be very brief in my reply.   They\r\n\r\nhave  raised so many questions and I may not be able to  deal\r\n\r\nwith all the points that were raised in the short time that I\r\n\r\nhave  available.  If they do not get an answer directly, they\r\n\r\ncan  always raise it again on another occasion.  If it  is  a\r\n\r\nQuestion for Oral Answer, I would certainly try to give  them\r\n\r\na fuller answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi basically supports the foreign worker policy,\r\n\r\nbut asked whether we can do more to get employers to redesign\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs  so  that  more of these jobs  can  be  given  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  cut down on the dependency.   Essentially,\r\n\r\nthe  point  was also made by Mr Loh Meng See.   Yesterday,  I\r\n\r\nhave  already explained what we are trying to do to encourage\r\n\r\nemployers to look more closely into improving their  business\r\n\r\nmodel, redesigning their jobs, so that they can tap on a pool\r\n\r\nof Singaporeans who are available for these jobs, rather than\r\n\r\njust turn to foreign workers as a first option.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh asked what can the Manpower Development\r\n\r\nAssistance  Scheme do to facilitate such job redesigns.   The\r\n\r\nanswer  is that we can do quite a lot, because with MDAS,  we\r\n\r\ncan help industries that want to carry out re-engineering and\r\n\r\njob  redesign,  and therefore requiring a different  type  of\r\n\r\nworkers,  to  have the workers trained for  their  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nMDAS  can  come  in  and  assist  such  industries  with  its\r\n\r\ntraining.  For instance, in the cleaning industry, commercial\r\n\r\ncleaning  companies have come together to form a  Centre  for\r\n\r\nCleaning Technology.  It is located at the Bukit Merah Skills\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Centre  and  we  are  training  several  hundred\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  doing jobs in the cleaning  industry.   We\r\n\r\nwould  continue  to  expand the intake of  workers  for  such\r\n\r\ntraining so that they can go out and do a better job, and  be\r\n\r\nmore  productive workers.   Our experience with some of these\r\n\r\nworkers who have already been through the training courses is\r\n\r\nthat  they  have been able to do a better job and,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nmany  of them have been promoted in their companies to  do  a\r\n\r\nhigher  level job.  We certainly would do more, in  terms  of\r\n\r\njob redesign, in order to ensure that foreign workers are not\r\n\r\nthe only solution to companies that require this category  of\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi and several other Members also said that we\r\n\r\nmust  take care of the foreign workers who are in our  midst.\r\n\r\nWe  have,  today,  nearly  500,000 foreign  workers  on  work\r\n\r\npermits  here in Singapore.  I agree with him that  they  are\r\n\r\nhere  to  do  a  job,  they contribute to  our  economy.   We\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  whether as an employer of a  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworker  or  a  company that employs hundreds or thousands  of\r\n\r\nforeign  workers, have to be responsible and we have to  look\r\n\r\nafter  the welfare, housing, accommodation and all the  other\r\n\r\nneeds of the foreign workers while they are here.  We take  a\r\n\r\nvery  serious  view  of employers who, for whatever  reasons,\r\n\r\nmistreat  their  foreign  workers.   Basically,  all  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,   like  local  workers,  are  protected  under   the\r\n\r\nEmployment   Act.   Those  employers  who  are   abusive   or\r\n\r\nexploitative face action under the Employment Act,  or  under\r\n\r\nsome other laws.  For instance, in the case\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  foreign  domestic workers, who are  not  covered  by  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Act, the Penal Code was amended in  May  1998  to\r\n\r\nenhance the penalty by one and a half times against employers\r\n\r\nwho commit offences against their foreign domestic workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers who mistreat their foreign workers in the\r\n\r\neconomic  sector,  for  instance,  face  sanctions  from   my\r\n\r\nMinistry once such abuses are detected, for example,  refusal\r\n\r\nto  pay  salaries  to the foreign workers, a  point  that  Mr\r\n\r\nThomas mentioned.  My Ministry will certainly be able to step\r\n\r\nin to help them. We have a Foreign Workers Unit in the Labour\r\n\r\nRelations  Department  that  will  help  foreign  workers  to\r\n\r\nresolve  any  disputes  that they have  with  employers.   Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi asked whether these disputes have actually gone up  or\r\n\r\nnot.   We receive, on average, about 400 complaints or  so  a\r\n\r\nmonth from the foreign workers that are present in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBy  and  large,  we have been able to resolve most  of  these\r\n\r\ncomplaints.   The numbers have gone up over the years  simply\r\n\r\nbecause   the  base  of  foreign  workers  in  Singapore   is\r\n\r\nincreasing.   But  I  would not say that they  have  gone  up\r\n\r\ndrastically.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of overstaying when employers retain the\r\n\r\nforeign  worker's passport and the foreign worker unknowingly\r\n\r\ncommits an offence of overstaying, my colleague, the Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Home  Affairs, had reiterated last week that no employer\r\n\r\nhas the right to retain a foreign worker's passport. In fact,\r\n\r\nemployers  should  not do so.  And there  is  no  reason  why\r\n\r\nforeign  workers unknowingly overstay, because they know  the\r\n\r\nterms  of their work permit that were granted to them.   They\r\n\r\nknow  that they should not stay beyond the validity of  their\r\n\r\nwork  permit.   And if the employer cancels the work  permit,\r\n\r\nthey  would  be  kept  informed by the employer,  because  no\r\n\r\nemployer  will  just cancel the work permit and  deliberately\r\n\r\nkeep it a secret from the foreign worker.  The reason is that\r\n\r\nonce  the  work  permit is cancelled,  the  employer  has  an\r\n\r\nobligation to repatriate the foreign worker,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfailing  which he will face forfeiture of the security  bond,\r\n\r\nwhich  is $5,000, if he does not successfully repatriate  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker after cancelling the work permit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you will find that the measures that are put in\r\n\r\nplace,  in  fact,  help to expedite the repatriation  of  the\r\n\r\nforeign worker, and also provide a reasonable protection  for\r\n\r\nthe  foreign  worker.  It prevents employers from  abandoning\r\n\r\ntheir foreign worker by willy-nilly just cancelling the  work\r\n\r\npermit  and  not informing the foreign worker.  They  have  a\r\n\r\nvery  short window, after the work permit has been cancelled,\r\n\r\nto  repatriate  the  worker and to produce  evidence  of  the\r\n\r\nrepatriation, so that the security bond can be cancelled.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas made the point that some of our\r\n\r\nemployment agents are exploitative.  They just bring  in  the\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  and collect the money from  them.   Can  we\r\n\r\nbypass the employment agents?  We have to understand the role\r\n\r\nof  the  employment agents.  They serve as  an  intermediary.\r\n\r\nThere  are  people  in Singapore who want to  employ  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers, whether it is a company or an employer of a domestic\r\n\r\nworker.  How do they go about getting the kind of person that\r\n\r\nthey  want  and  where from?  It is very difficult  for  many\r\n\r\nemployers, especially if we talk about employers of  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers,  on  their  own to recruit a foreign  worker.   Some\r\n\r\npeople  have been able to do this, because they have contacts\r\n\r\nand  friends  overseas and so on and so forth.  But  for  the\r\n\r\nvast  majority, they would not know where to start  on  their\r\n\r\nown.  So they go to an agent.  The agent actually fulfills  a\r\n\r\nuseful role as an intermediary to bring foreign workers  into\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are aware that some agents may not abide by\r\n\r\nall  the rules and regulations that are imposed on them.   We\r\n\r\nmonitor  their operations closely, so that in case we  detect\r\n\r\nany violation, we will certainly act against them.  Under the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Agents  Act, we can revoke  their  licence,  even\r\n\r\nforfeit the security deposit that they have placed with us if\r\n\r\nwe  detect evidence that they have acted against the interest\r\n\r\nof  the  employer in Singapore, or acted against the interest\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe foreign workers whom they have brought in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also made the point that some foreign workers\r\n\r\ncome   in  and  work  under  certain  terms  and  conditions,\r\n\r\nincluding those who come here on employment passes, and  they\r\n\r\nshould be better informed.  If they come in on specific terms\r\n\r\nof  employment and if they feel that the employer had somehow\r\n\r\nchanged  those terms and conditions of employment,  they  can\r\n\r\nalways  turn  to my Ministry for assistance.   We  offer  the\r\n\r\nservices of the special Foreign Workers Unit to help  workers\r\n\r\nwho  face such difficulties.  And I said earlier on, we  deal\r\n\r\nwith about 400-odd appeals a month, and if there are any such\r\n\r\nworkers  who  feel  that their employer  is  trying  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage  of  them by changing the terms and  conditions  of\r\n\r\nemployment, we will be very pleased to assist them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have responded to Mr Loh Meng See's point\r\n\r\njust  now  about getting employers to redesign jobs  to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that  we do not become overly dependent.   As  for  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Glam, he feels his residents' unhappiness\r\n\r\nwith the congregation of the foreign workers in various parts\r\n\r\nof  Kampong  Glam.  I agree with him that this is a  problem.\r\n\r\nThat  is  why we are trying to manage the number  of  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers in Singapore.  We use a variety of measures.  Several\r\n\r\nMembers have spoken about the foreign workers levy.  That  is\r\n\r\none  of the key measures that we have in hand to moderate the\r\n\r\ndemand  for  foreign  workers.  Without the  foreign  workers\r\n\r\nlevy,  we will have a greater number of foreign workers  here\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  The demand is almost insatiable, in a  sense,\r\n\r\nbecause  today  we  have more than 140,000  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.  And without the foreign workers levy, for instance,\r\n\r\nwe  are  going to have a  higher number  because  the  income\r\n\r\nlevel of Singaporeans has continued to go up, notwithstanding\r\n\r\nthe  economic crisis.  In fact, during the economic  downturn\r\n\r\nin  1998, the number of foreign domestic workers continued to\r\n\r\nincrease by about 5% over the year, although the increase\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwas at a slower rate compared to previous years.  So we use a\r\n\r\nmixture  of  dependency ceiling and foreign workers  levy  to\r\n\r\nregulate and to control the demand for foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have, in fact, spoken about the\r\n\r\naccommodation  for foreign workers.  I think  this  would  be\r\n\r\nmainly  the foreign workers in the economic sectors, such  as\r\n\r\nthose  in  the  construction industry and  the  manufacturing\r\n\r\nsector.   For  those  who  are in  the  households  of  their\r\n\r\nemployer,  the  foreign  domestic  workers,  of  course,  are\r\n\r\nprovided  with  accommodation in the homes of  the  employer.\r\n\r\nAccommodation is therefore not a problem.  But for  those  in\r\n\r\nthe   economic  sectors,  one  of  the  undertakings  of  the\r\n\r\nemployer,  when  they  bring in the  foreign  worker,  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  suitable  accommodation.   And  we  have  a  certain\r\n\r\nstandard  about  the  kind  of accommodation  which  must  be\r\n\r\nprovided  on  the  worksite, for instance, so  that   foreign\r\n\r\nconstruction  workers  are  entitled  to  reasonable  housing\r\n\r\nstandards  if  they are placed in worksites.   Alternatively,\r\n\r\nthe employers will have to provide rented accommodation.  And\r\n\r\nthere  are  also rules about how many people you can  put  in\r\n\r\nrented  accommodation, whether it is  in  a  room,  house  or\r\n\r\napartment.   The  Building Control Authority  will  regularly\r\n\r\ncheck  if  there are employers who are abusing this provision\r\n\r\nand overcrowding their foreign workers.  They will also check\r\n\r\nthe worksite housing provided for the construction workers to\r\n\r\nensure  that  this complies with all the sanitary  and  other\r\n\r\nenvironmental requirements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we will continue to study this issue,\r\n\r\nbecause having more than 500,000 foreign workers in our midst\r\n\r\nis  a  tremendous challenge, in terms of accommodating  them.\r\n\r\nWhile  some foreign workers are accommodated on the worksite,\r\n\r\nincreasingly, worksites are organised in such a way  that  it\r\n\r\nis  very difficult to accommodate them.  So they have to look\r\n\r\nfor off-site accommodation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of\r\n\r\nNational Development to identify more areas of land which can\r\n\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nset   aside  for  housing  foreign  workers.   And   we   are\r\n\r\nencouraging the private sector to come forward to  invest  in\r\n\r\nsuch  short-term  housing  for foreign  workers.   This  will\r\n\r\nprovide  much better accommodation.  Already, some  companies\r\n\r\nhave  invested  and developed such dormitory housing.   There\r\n\r\nare  several of these scattered around the island,  and  they\r\n\r\nare available to employers who want to place their workers in\r\n\r\nsuch dormitory housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked about the foreign workers\r\n\r\nlevy.   As  I  have  explained, it is a key  feature  of  our\r\n\r\nforeign  workers  policy  to use  the  levy  as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nregulating  the demand.  We will continue to use the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  levy to  regulate the demand.  In the  case  of  the\r\n\r\npoint  raised  by  Mr Yeo Guat Kwang on the two-tier  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  levy  - the skilled workers on a lower levy  at  $30\r\n\r\nand  a  higher  levy for the unskilled workers   -   we  will\r\n\r\ncontinue to use this in order to encourage more employers  to\r\n\r\nrecruit  skilled workers who can do a bigger and better  job;\r\n\r\ntherefore, resulting in a lower demand for actual  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will leave it to the employers when they employ\r\n\r\nskilled workers on the lower levy to set their wages for  the\r\n\r\nskilled  workers.   It is a policy of Government that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot interfere in the labour market to determine wages.  Wages\r\n\r\nare  on a \"willing buyer, willing seller\" basis, and we leave\r\n\r\nthe  setting of wages, both for local and foreign workers  to\r\n\r\nmarket forces to determine.  However, our experience is that,\r\n\r\nin  fact, the skilled foreign workers generally do receive  a\r\n\r\nhigher  salary  than the unskilled foreign workers.   So  the\r\n\r\nlower  levy therefore has resulted in employers paying  their\r\n\r\nskilled workers a higher wage, which is in line with what  we\r\n\r\nhave in mind.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also asked whether we can review the sectoral\r\n\r\napproach in locating the foreign workers.  The answer is yes,\r\n\r\nwe  do that.  From time to time, we do make adjustment to our\r\n\r\noverall  sectoral approach for allocating foreign workers  to\r\n\r\naccommodate  the  special needs of certain  industries.   For\r\n\r\ninstance, now that we are promoting the construction industry\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nuse  more off-site fabrication, we will be looking at how  we\r\n\r\ncan   assist   those  who  are  undertaking   such   off-site\r\n\r\nfabrication work to have access to foreign workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also looked at the process in the petrochemical\r\n\r\nand   pharmaceutical  plants   -   these  are   the   process\r\n\r\nengineering companies  -  to see how we can better manage the\r\n\r\npool  of  foreign workers in this industry.  We have  allowed\r\n\r\nthem  to  use  the workers who are doing process construction\r\n\r\nwork   to   also  carry  out  process  maintenance   because,\r\n\r\nessentially,  they are workers with the same set  of  skills.\r\n\r\nSo  instead of having two different sets of workers,  one  to\r\n\r\ndo  construction  and  the  other  to  do  maintenance  under\r\n\r\nmanufacturing, we have merged the two schemes,  so  that  the\r\n\r\npetrochemical  plant can depend on just  the  same  group  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers to do both construction and maintenance.   In\r\n\r\nthis  way, we are responding and we will continue to look  at\r\n\r\nthe needs of other sectors that warrant special adjustment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members look at it in this way that there is an\r\n\r\noverall  framework  to regulate foreign workers,  both  using\r\n\r\ndependency ceiling and levy, then I hope they understand  why\r\n\r\nthe  levy  remains an important tool to moderate the  demand.\r\n\r\nAnd  in the case of the foreign domestic  workers, the demand\r\n\r\nhas   continued  to  go  up,  notwithstanding  the   economic\r\n\r\ndownturn.   Over the years, we have increased the  number  of\r\n\r\nforeign  domestic workers dramatically.  We started out  with\r\n\r\nhardly  any  in  1978.  Today, we have more than  140,000  of\r\n\r\nthem.   I  believe that we will continue to have to  use  the\r\n\r\nlevy  as a mechanism to regulate the demand.  And as  I  have\r\n\r\nsaid  recently on a number of occasions, the foreign  workers\r\n\r\nlevy,  including the foreign domestic workers levy,  will  be\r\n\r\nreviewed later this year, after we have a better feel of  how\r\n\r\nthe economy is responding to the changes around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I think Mr Loh Meng See mentioned\r\n\r\nthe   point   about   allowing  management  corporations   of\r\n\r\ncondominiums,  for  instance,  to  recruit  foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.   I  think  we  have discussed  this  issue  before,\r\n\r\nwhether we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncan  allow  commercial companies to recruit  women  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries and to deploy them to work as domestic\r\n\r\nworkers  in  the  homes of Singaporeans.  There  are  several\r\n\r\nissues  here.  We have considered this idea on  a  number  of\r\n\r\noccasions, whether or not we should allow such services to be\r\n\r\noffered.  But there are problems like, for instance, who will\r\n\r\nbe  held  accountable  for housing this additional  group  of\r\n\r\nforeign workers, and the propensity for abuse when you  allow\r\n\r\nemployers, employment agencies or a company to recruit  large\r\n\r\nnumbers  of  these foreign women to come to Singapore  to  do\r\n\r\nthis  kind  of work.  On balance, we decided that  we  should\r\n\r\nretain  our  present arrangement whereby the women  from  the\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries who do this domestic work are assigned\r\n\r\nto   a   specific   household   where   they   are   provided\r\n\r\naccommodation.  We can hold the employer responsible  and  we\r\n\r\ncan  ensure that the foreign domestic worker's welfare is not\r\n\r\njeopardised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered most of the points.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, according to the Yearbook of\r\n\r\nStatistics 2000, in 1999 our workforce was about 1.9 million,\r\n\r\nbut  CPF  contributors were only 1.22 million.   There  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  of  760,000 people, which  even  after  deducting\r\n\r\nforeigners  and  foreign workers, we  will  end  with  a  few\r\n\r\nhundred  thousand Singaporeans not contributing to  CPF.   In\r\n\r\nfact,  in  the December 2000 Manpower News, it says 3.35%  of\r\n\r\nworkers  in private sector establishments are under  contract\r\n\r\nfor service, which means they do not contribute to CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPF is the main safety net in Singapore. Not being a\r\n\r\nmember of CPF means these people may have difficulty with old\r\n\r\nage  funds,  medical  care,  home  ownership,  education   of\r\n\r\nchildren,  and  the other things that Central Provident  Fund\r\n\r\ncovers.  These are important things.  I would like to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister how the Ministry is going\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nabout  to  try and get more people to be brought  in  as  CPF\r\n\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is this. If we look at the demography\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, more of us are getting older, that part  of\r\n\r\nthe  baby  boomers are retiring which is a large number,  and\r\n\r\nthey will draw out CPF funds, but the people coming in may be\r\n\r\nless.   Will this result in a net outflow of funds from  CPF?\r\n\r\nAnd  if  more  CPF funds are coming out than going  in,  what\r\n\r\nwould be the consequence of this negative cash flow for CPF?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to say is that many of us CPF\r\n\r\nmembers  are  investing in the stock market.  Most  of  these\r\n\r\ninvestments are challenging and very interesting, but not all\r\n\r\nof  them  made  money.   But when you  lose  money  with  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings,  you are actually eating into your old age  security\r\n\r\nand  safety  net.  While, on the other hand,  investment  has\r\n\r\nrisks, I think we should still help our members to make  wise\r\n\r\ndecisions and also give them information on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we should also review the social safety net,\r\n\r\nbecause CPF has got its limitations.  We keep hearing that in\r\n\r\nthe new economy, workers will have to change jobs more often,\r\n\r\nwhich means they lose their jobs more often, and the law says\r\n\r\nthat  if you work less than three years, you are not entitled\r\n\r\nto  retrenchment benefits.  But even if you  are,  there  are\r\n\r\ncompanies  which  do not pay retrenchment  benefits.   So  if\r\n\r\npeople  lose  their  jobs in between jobs,  we  do  not  have\r\n\r\nadequate  social safety measures for them.  I would  like  to\r\n\r\nask  the  Ministry whether it could also look into  providing\r\n\r\nmore  comprehensive and wider coverage of the  social  safety\r\n\r\nnet.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chiam, there are about 10 minutes left\r\n\r\non this amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, before I begin, can I ask a\r\n\r\nclarification  from  the Minister?  He says  that  there  are\r\n\r\n500,000  foreign  workers.   Does  that  number  include  the\r\n\r\n140,000 domestic maids?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> So 500,000 is the total. Therefore,\r\n\r\nthe  total  number  of foreign workers in Singapore  is  only\r\n\r\nabout 500,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have got a cut on restoration of CPF. The Asian\r\n\r\ncrisis  hit Singapore in July 1997.  The Government formed  a\r\n\r\nCommittee to recommend cost-cutting measures.  Among the cost-cutting measures recommended was a 10 percentage cut  in  the\r\n\r\nemployer's  component of the workers' CPF.  This  is  a  very\r\n\r\ndrastic measure to take.  The Government sought this route to\r\n\r\nsave the economy of the nation.  The workers sacrificed their\r\n\r\nwages.   As  a  result, costs were lowered and this  made  it\r\n\r\npossible for the economy to pick up and also for the  country\r\n\r\nto achieve a 9.9% growth last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the workers want to know how much in total they\r\n\r\nhave sacrificed in terms of their wages, and how much of  the\r\n\r\nprofits  made  by the industrial sector are as  a  result  of\r\n\r\ntheir sacrifices made, and how much of those profits made  by\r\n\r\nbusinesses have gone to the Government in terms of taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the workers' movement must surely deserve some kind\r\n\r\nof  a  reward  for  their excellent work they  have  done  to\r\n\r\npersuade  the workers to accept a huge 10 percentage  cut  in\r\n\r\ntheir CPF.  I would like to ask the Government to give, as  a\r\n\r\nreward,   a   one-time  grant  to  the  labour  movement   in\r\n\r\nappreciation  of the sacrifices of the workers  to  help  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  economy to pick up during the last  two  years  of\r\n\r\nrecession.  The grant could be a one-time grant and  be  used\r\n\r\nfor  training  the workers, in addition to what  has  already\r\n\r\nbeen given.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full restoration of CPF has still not been\r\n\r\nimplemented.  The restoration has only reached 16  percentage\r\n\r\npoints  of the employer's component of CPF.  I hope the  full\r\n\r\nrestoration  to  the 20% CPF can be done  quickly.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister perhaps give an indication of when this can be done?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, Mr Thomas Thomas raised several\r\n\r\nquestions on the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCPF.   He asked what would be the impact of the negative cash\r\n\r\nflow  - fewer contributors, as part of the ageing population.\r\n\r\nLet  me say that there is no cause for alarm.  Over the  last\r\n\r\nfive  years,  the  Central  Provident  Fund  has  experienced\r\n\r\npositive  cash  flow,  although  the  net  inflow  has   been\r\n\r\ndropping.   It has been dropping not because of a  crisis  or\r\n\r\nbecause  of  losses.   In  fact, the Central  Provident  Fund\r\n\r\nsystem  is fully funded by the members themselves.  It  is  a\r\n\r\nsystem where the payout for the members, when they reach  55,\r\n\r\nis  drawn  from all the savings that they have  been  setting\r\n\r\naside during their working life.  So there is really no cross-generation  subsidy or overlap.  Today's retirees  or  senior\r\n\r\ncitizens, when they reach age 55 and draw on their  CPF,  are\r\n\r\nactually drawing on the savings that they put aside  and  not\r\n\r\ndrawing on somebody else's accumulated savings.  Hence, there\r\n\r\nis  no  need to be concerned even if CPF Board should show  a\r\n\r\ndecline in the net fund inflow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why the net fund inflow is declining is\r\n\r\nthat  the population is ageing and, as Mr Thomas pointed out,\r\n\r\nthere  are  now  more  older workers, and  also  because  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has liberalised the use of CPF.  So  members  can\r\n\r\nnow  withdraw  nearly  all of their CPF  savings  to  invest,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is purchasing shares or investing  in  insurance\r\n\r\npolicies  or  some  other  forms  of  investment.   We   must\r\n\r\ntherefore expect a higher rate of withdrawal from CPF, unlike\r\n\r\nin  the  past where all the CPF money could not be  withdrawn\r\n\r\nuntil  you  reach  age 55.  Today, even before  age  55,  the\r\n\r\nmember is able to withdraw the money not just for housing  or\r\n\r\nmedical needs, but also for their investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to reiterate that although the net\r\n\r\nfund  inflow has been declining, there is no cause for alarm.\r\n\r\nIt  is  not  a sign of impending crisis or inability  of  the\r\n\r\nCentral  Provident  Fund Board to meet its  obligations,  but\r\n\r\nrather  a  reflection of the ageing workforce  and  also  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of the CPF system, with more investment options\r\n\r\nfor the members.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas also expressed concern whether the social\r\n\r\nsecurity net is adequate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  not.   I  think we have used the CPF as a very  effective\r\n\r\nmechanism  to  ensure that our workers are prepared  for  any\r\n\r\nsudden  economic downturn, not only just by way of  adjusting\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  contribution rate but also ensuring that there  are\r\n\r\nsavings for the rainy days.  We will continue to use the  CPF\r\n\r\nas  a  principal  means of social safety net  by  encouraging\r\n\r\nworkers  to  save  as  much as they  can  when  they  are  in\r\n\r\nemployment.  Of course, the most important thing here  is  to\r\n\r\nensure   that  the  workers  stay  employed  and   keep   our\r\n\r\nunemployment  rate low, so that nearly all  Singaporeans  can\r\n\r\nhave  jobs  if  they want.  The fact that we  are  discussing\r\n\r\nabout  foreign workers - there are more than 500,000  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers  in  Singapore and even if you discount  the  140,000\r\n\r\nforeign domestic workers, you have 360,000 foreign workers in\r\n\r\nthe  economic  sector  - means there  are  jobs  aplenty  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans if they want to take on these jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think creating employment is the best social safety\r\n\r\nnet  as it ensures that all Singaporeans who are able to work\r\n\r\nhave  the  skills  for the job are able to  make  a  positive\r\n\r\ncontribution  to  the economy.  That is much  more  important\r\n\r\nthan considering other options.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to CPF investments, yes, some CPF members\r\n\r\nhave  lost  money; others have also gained.  By  liberalising\r\n\r\nthe  CPF system, we have encouraged members to make their own\r\n\r\ninvestment  decision.  In the process, some  would  make  bad\r\n\r\ndecisions,  but they have to accept the cost for making  such\r\n\r\nbad   decisions.    We  believe  that  over   time,   prudent\r\n\r\ninvestments will enable more CPF members to enhance their old\r\n\r\nage  savings, and that this is something that has got  to  be\r\n\r\nacquired.  People have to learn how to manage their  savings,\r\n\r\nwhether  it  is their own cash savings or their CPF  savings.\r\n\r\nThe Board itself will provide more information to CPF members\r\n\r\nso  that they can be better informed with regard to investing\r\n\r\ntheir savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam asked whether we are giving adequate\r\n\r\nrecognition to the workers' movement ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.

Old private estates deteriorate  as  well\r\n\r\nand they should be similarly upgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am heartened therefore when the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment  on  17th  October  2000  released   its   Estate\r\n\r\nUpgrading Programme (EUP) and had chosen five private estates\r\n\r\nas  the  first batch for this programme.  However,  such  EUP\r\n\r\nonly  applies  to public areas and does not cover  \"works  on\r\n\r\nprivate  land  and  facilities, including  common  areas  and\r\n\r\nproperties  of  condominiums and private apartments\".   Going\r\n\r\nfurther   and  having  these  old  condominiums  and  private\r\n\r\napartments  upgraded  as well would be even  better  for  the\r\n\r\nestates.   Whilst the private owners themselves are  expected\r\n\r\nto bear the expenses for this, I feel that the onerous burden\r\n\r\nfor such payments should be facilitated.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, owners whose HDB homes are owner-occupied and\r\n\r\nwho  are below 55 years of age can withdraw their CPF savings\r\n\r\nin  the Ordinary Account to pay for the upgrading.  As an  MP\r\n\r\nwho has many residents who are private condominium owners,  I\r\n\r\nhear  their  frequent  calls for the  use  of  available  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings  to  offset  the costs of upgrading  their  property.\r\n\r\nDwellers  in  the private estates feel that  they  should  be\r\n\r\ngiven the same kind of privileges and be allowed to use their\r\n\r\nCPF  savings  to upgrade their homes.  Many of  my  residents\r\n\r\nhave   argued  that,  similar  to  upgrading  of  HDB  flats,\r\n\r\nupgrading of their apartments is a form of asset enhancement,\r\n\r\nas  the  value of their flats will be enhanced.  Furthermore,\r\n\r\nupgrading  would  allow them to enjoy the better  quality  of\r\n\r\nlife enjoyed by their cousins in upgrading HDB homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a pressing problem and is especially so for\r\n\r\nsome  of the older developments which are in a very sad state\r\n\r\nof  disrepair.   It  is quite difficult,  indeed,  to  garner\r\n\r\nenough  support from their residents to carry out  any  major\r\n\r\nupgrading  project,  especially when it involves  substantial\r\n\r\nexpenditure.   Allowing the use of available CPF  funds  will\r\n\r\ncertainly reduce the awesome burden of any outright  payments\r\n\r\nfor  the upgrading.  This is even more significant for owners\r\n\r\nof  the older condominiums who are elderly or retired and may\r\n\r\nnot  be able to afford to contribute the thousands of dollars\r\n\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech the Minister for Manpower to look into the\r\n\r\nabove issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, during last year's budget, the\r\n\r\nMinister  of  State,  Mr  Othman Eusofe,  told  us  that  his\r\n\r\nMinistry  is  in  consultation  with  NTUC,  SNEF  and  other\r\n\r\nagencies  on  the ratification of ILO Conventions.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask him on the progress of these consultations.   I\r\n\r\nhope the Government will ratify the ILO Conventions as in the\r\n\r\nDeclaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights of   Workers\r\n\r\nas  soon  as  possible.  Delay in ratifying will  convey  the\r\n\r\nimpression that there is an abuse of labour, and it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nblatant  and widespread here, which is not true.  Delay  will\r\n\r\ntherefore  affect  our  image and would  attract  unwarranted\r\n\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, let me reiterate that the\r\n\r\nprimary  objective of the CPF is to provide for the  members'\r\n\r\nold  age.  We have always not allowed the use of CPF  savings\r\n\r\nfor  upgrading or renovating properties, whether  it  is  HDB\r\n\r\nflats  or  otherwise.  An exception was made for the  nation-wide HDB Main Upgrading Programme because this is basically a\r\n\r\nGovernment  initiated  programme  to  rejuvenate  old  public\r\n\r\nhousing  estates and also to enhance the assets of  citizens.\r\n\r\nBecause  the  cost  of  upgrading is  much  larger  than  the\r\n\r\npayments made by the home owners themselves in the course  of\r\n\r\nthe  Main  Upgrading  Programme, the home  owners  receive  a\r\n\r\nsizeable  subsidy from the Government.  Hence, it is unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  the upgraded flats' market value will fall below  to  a\r\n\r\npoint  where  they  are  unable to  recover  what  they  have\r\n\r\ninvested through their CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the privately initiated refurbishment or\r\n\r\nupgrading, whether it is HDB or private residential  estates,\r\n\r\nsuch as condominiums, the owner has to bear the full cost  of\r\n\r\nsuch  renovation or refurbishment.  Therefore,  if  we  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to  withdraw  from their CPF, you will  find  that  the\r\n\r\namount  to be withdrawn is going to be much larger than  what\r\n\r\nis  required  for the share of the Main Upgrading  Programme.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  it will also be very difficult to regulate  the\r\n\r\nfrequency of upgrading and renovation as well as to spell out\r\n\r\nexactly  the conditions under which CPF can be used for  such\r\n\r\nupgrading.  So we are concerned that the liberal use  of  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings for flat upgrading, or renovating private residential\r\n\r\nproperties, will result in premature withdrawal of a member's\r\n\r\nold age savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I also want to point out that people living\r\n\r\nin a private housing estate are generally in the upper income\r\n\r\nbracket.   On the other hand, CPF contributions  have  got  a\r\n\r\ncap.   No CPF contributions are required for that portion  of\r\n\r\nthe salary above $6,000.  Only the portion below\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n$6,000  attracts CPF contributions.  Therefore, those  people\r\n\r\nwho  are earning more than $6,000 per month should have  more\r\n\r\npersonal savings apart from what is already saved in the  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts.   Their CPF savings will also represent  a  smaller\r\n\r\nproportion of their total savings available to them.   So  it\r\n\r\nis  therefore  not  unreasonable to expect  those  living  in\r\n\r\nprivate properties who want to carry out home renovations  to\r\n\r\ndo  so  with their personal savings, rather than  to  tap  on\r\n\r\ntheir CPF savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also mentioned that some of these are older\r\n\r\npeople  living in private properties, condominiums and landed\r\n\r\nproperties,  and some of them may well be retirees.   Let  me\r\n\r\npoint  out  that  if  they  are  retirees,  they  would  have\r\n\r\nwithdrawn most of their CPF from age 55 onwards, and if  they\r\n\r\nhave  invested  the  CPF,  or if they  have  put  them  aside\r\n\r\ncarefully,  then  certainly they would have sufficient  funds\r\n\r\nleft  to renovate or upgrade their properties.  Anyway,  they\r\n\r\nwould have very little CPF left in their CPF accounts, except\r\n\r\nfor the Minimum Sum.  That would not be of much help even  if\r\n\r\nwe  allow  the  retirees to use the money  to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas asked about ratification of ILO Conventions.\r\n\r\nLet  me point out that we have ratified two of the eight core\r\n\r\nconventions.   These are the Convention 98 on  the  Right  to\r\n\r\nOrganise a Collective Bargaining and Convention 29 on  Forced\r\n\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, we announced that we will ratify Convention\r\n\r\n182  on  the Worst Form of Child Labour.  We have no  problem\r\n\r\ncomplying  with  this latest of the core Conventions  on  the\r\n\r\nWorst Form of Child Labour and we will proceed to ratify this\r\n\r\nConvention  in  June  this year at the  International  Labour\r\n\r\nConference.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ratify ILO Conventions taking into consideration\r\n\r\nour  economic circumstances and national interest.   I  would\r\n\r\nalso  like  to  point out to the Members  that  not  all  ILO\r\n\r\nConventions are ratified by every member state.  For example,\r\n\r\nthe United\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nStates  has  to-date ratified only 13 Conventions,  including\r\n\r\nonly two out of the eight core Conventions.  We have ratified\r\n\r\n<br><br>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conventions, including two of the eight core Conventions.\r\n\r\nSo  in comparison, we are not doing too badly.  And the point\r\n\r\nthat  he made about the impression that the workers are being\r\n\r\noppressed  in  Singapore  is a totally  wrong  and  unfounded\r\n\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to study the ILO Conventions and seek\r\n\r\nto  ratify  those that do not conflict with our national  and\r\n\r\nworkers'  interests.   When we do so,  we  will  consult  the\r\n\r\nNational   Trades  Union  Congress  and  also  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nNational Employers' Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your indulgence to\r\n\r\nmake a clarification from you?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have 1 1/2 minutes left.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Am I allowed to clarify?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I note that you have applied\r\n\r\nthe  \"guillotine\" time on the first amendment on the Ministry\r\n\r\nof Manpower to allow the remaining amendments to be moved on.\r\n\r\nWhereas, in yesterday's debate on PMO, you did not apply  the\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\"  time on the first amendment, resulting  in  the\r\n\r\nremaining  two amendments not being moved.

I see unions are recognised as an effective  body\r\n\r\nand have contributed to our economic and social developments.\r\n\r\nThere  is urgency in reviewing this for a few reasons.  There\r\n\r\nis  now  the  Singapore Business Federation  in  place,  with\r\n\r\ncompulsory  membership  for certain types  of  employers  and\r\n\r\ncompanies,  which  would strengthen  the  employers'  leg  of\r\n\r\ntripartism  which  is good and proper.  There  are  arguments\r\n\r\nwhich have been heard.  I buy those arguments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also have to use the same arguments for labour\r\n\r\nmovement because the unions are in a very peculiar situation.\r\n\r\nThe union does not have the right to organise all classes  of\r\n\r\nworkers.   They only can take workers who have a contract  of\r\n\r\nservice, not contract for service.  But even then, there  are\r\n\r\ncategories of workers to be exempted.  We are not allowed  to\r\n\r\norganise.   The  other point is that the union  is  the  only\r\n\r\norganisation that renders its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nservice  for  free.   Yesterday, during  the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Finance, we were told that social responsibility\r\n\r\nalso  includes  the  charging of fees for services  rendered.\r\n\r\nBut  for  unions, when we negotiate collective agreements  or\r\n\r\nNWC  recommendations, a large number of workers benefit  from\r\n\r\nit,  a  lot of employers benefit, but no fee is charged.   So\r\n\r\nthere is a big problem of free riders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not suggesting we have a closed-shop principle\r\n\r\nbecause that violates the freedom of association, but we  can\r\n\r\nstill look at the laws to see whether we could have an agency\r\n\r\nfee  basis  that those who benefit from it pay something  for\r\n\r\nit.   In  that  sense, it would be fairer.  There  are  other\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Trade Unions Act which are restrictive  and\r\n\r\nwhich  actually make it difficult for unions to work.  Rather\r\n\r\nthan  go  through  all the arguments and provisions  here,  I\r\n\r\nwould suggest that we have a national committee to look at it\r\n\r\nand  see  how we could strengthen tripartism by strengthening\r\n\r\nthe  trade unions movement and other associated laws in order\r\n\r\nthat  workers will have a greater say and influence.  If left\r\n\r\nalone,  even  in  the  normal course of events  of  employers\r\n\r\nversus the workers, employers have greater influence.  It  is\r\n\r\nwith  the  assistance of Government, the rules and  framework\r\n\r\nthat  there is a balance of power.  So we should really  look\r\n\r\nat  the  laws to make sure that these things are strengthened\r\n\r\nso that we could get on with the business of making Singapore\r\n\r\nmore  prosperous  and a better place for everyone,  including\r\n\r\ncompanies which want to make more money and workers who  want\r\n\r\nto have a better life.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe):</b> Sir, first, let me take the portion of the\r\n\r\nquestion on the amendment to the Trade Unions Act.  Mr Thomas\r\n\r\nhas suggested that the union rules be liberalised to make  it\r\n\r\neasier  for unions to operate.  Let me just mention that  the\r\n\r\nTrade Unions Act was indeed reviewed last year and amendments\r\n\r\nwere  made  in  consultation with the National  Trades  Union\r\n\r\nCongress and the Singapore National Employers' Federation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments will give greater flexibility to\r\n\r\nthe  unions in their decision-making process, and also in the\r\n\r\nway  they use the union funds.  In fact, union administration\r\n\r\nhas  been  made  easier with the introduction of  information\r\n\r\ntechnology and, subject to the provisions, unions are free to\r\n\r\nalter  their union rules, with the approval of their members.\r\n\r\nSince  the amendments to the Trade Unions Act were introduced\r\n\r\nonly recently in December last year, at this stage, we do not\r\n\r\nsee a need to further review the Trade Unions Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about tripartism, I agree that tripartite\r\n\r\ncooperation  among  the Government, the employers  and  trade\r\n\r\nunions  over  the last three decades, has played  a  critical\r\n\r\nrole  in  maintaining industrial harmony and in  bringing  in\r\n\r\nsignificant  benefits to the economy, the employers  and  the\r\n\r\nworkers.   It  helped  to  generate a national  consensus  on\r\n\r\nimportant employment and industrial relations issues,  helped\r\n\r\nto  formulate collective responses to deal with the  economic\r\n\r\ncrisis,  and  therefore, it has become a  strong  competitive\r\n\r\nadvantage  for  us,  particularly as a  choice  location  for\r\n\r\ninvestments resulting in economic growth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas spoke about the formation of the\r\n\r\nSingapore Business Federation (SBF) which represents  a  wide\r\n\r\nspectrum of employers, both the MNCs and the local companies,\r\n\r\nand  his concern that this may affect the existing tripartite\r\n\r\nrelationship  among  the  three local  partners.   Employers'\r\n\r\ninterests   will  continue  to  be  represented  at   various\r\n\r\ntripartite  bodies,  including the  National  Wages  Council.\r\n\r\nAnd,  with  more  resources  and  better  coordination,   the\r\n\r\nSingapore Business Federation will, in fact, be in  a  better\r\n\r\nposition to strengthen the tripartitie nexus and bring  about\r\n\r\neconomic  growth, better jobs, as well as an  enhancement  of\r\n\r\nour  workers' welfare.  That the bigger businesses will  have\r\n\r\nto  contribute  to the SBF will not mean that big  businesses\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndominate  our  tripartite forums.   We  will  always  seek  a\r\n\r\nbalance to ensure that the interests of employees in the  big\r\n\r\nor small companies are met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas proposed that a fee be levied on\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are non-union members, before they could  enjoy\r\n\r\nthe  same  terms  and benefits as provided in the  collective\r\n\r\nagreement.   I  do  not think that this is appropriate.   The\r\n\r\nimposition  of  such  a  fee will be tantamount  to  coercing\r\n\r\nworkers to join the trade unions, and this would run contrary\r\n\r\nto  the principle of freedom of association.  I think  it  is\r\n\r\nalso  tantamount  to  forcing employers  to  pay  their  non-unionised  workers less than union members.  While  they  are\r\n\r\nnot  union  members, they may well be doing the same  job  as\r\n\r\nunion  members.  So it is unfair to compel employers  to  pay\r\n\r\nthem less before they have opted to join the union or pay the\r\n\r\nagency fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the majority of collective agreements already\r\n\r\ncontain   provisions  prohibiting  non-union   members   from\r\n\r\nenjoying   more  favourable  benefits  than  those   in   the\r\n\r\ncollective  agreement.  In other words, employers cannot  pay\r\n\r\nbetter  benefits to non-unionised workers.  I think  this  is\r\n\r\nreasonable.  It also ensures that employers cannot  undermine\r\n\r\nthe  efforts of the unions by offering non-unionised  members\r\n\r\nbetter  terms  and conditions of employment.   I  think  this\r\n\r\nprovision,  already in place, places the trade  unions  in  a\r\n\r\ngood position to take advantage of the wide variety of social\r\n\r\nbenefits which they can offer to promote union membership.  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that  there  are many benefits,  apart  from  better\r\n\r\nprotection in employment, that workers would miss out if they\r\n\r\ndo  not  choose  to  join the unions.  Trade  unions  should,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  leverage on these benefits  as  an  incentive  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more workers to join them, instead of  imposing  a\r\n\r\nfee  as  a  means to increase their membership.  This  sounds\r\n\r\nlike  paying  a membership fee without the full  benefits  of\r\n\r\nmembership.   So,  in my view, it is a regressive  step  and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  I  do  not  think that  we  should  support  this\r\n\r\nproposal  for an agency fee, as I do not think it serves  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the labour movement in the long run.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I would just like to make the\r\n\r\npoint  that I find it a bit of a contradiction that  when  it\r\n\r\ncomes  to employers and businesses, it is all right to impose\r\n\r\na  levy, but when it comes to workers' organisations,  it  is\r\n\r\nnot so.  With those comments, Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (5), Mr Chay Wai Chuen.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TG 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have spoken on this topic on several occasions\r\n\r\nbefore,  and  this  matter has also been a topic  of  concern\r\n\r\nraised by the Auditor-General in his earlier report.  I  have\r\n\r\ncome across many instances when workmen involved in workplace\r\n\r\naccidents have had to wait for more than a year in order  for\r\n\r\nthem  to  get the insurance company to pay the money  due  to\r\n\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I have two such meet-the-people session\r\n\r\ncases.  These workers have had to be hospitalised and be away\r\n\r\nfrom  work.   Their family income is affected and they  incur\r\n\r\nall  kinds  of  penalties by the Town  Council  and  HDB  for\r\n\r\narrears.  These are not cases where there is any dispute that\r\n\r\ncompensation is due, or over the amount.  The workman suffers\r\n\r\ninjury  and  he is waiting and waiting to be paid.   Can  the\r\n\r\nMinister  cut  short  any  bureaucratic  logjams  that   have\r\n\r\nhappened so often?  I also notice that usually the cases  get\r\n\r\nsettled  quite fast after I raised them in the  Committee  of\r\n\r\nSupply, but it happens again and again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, workmen\r\n\r\ncompensation  claims  are divided into  temporary  incapacity\r\n\r\n(TI), permanent incapacity (PI) and fatal cases.  Sir, in the\r\n\r\nyear  2000, the average time taken to assess TI, PI and fatal\r\n\r\ncases  is  two,  nine  and  six  months,  respectively.   The\r\n\r\npermanent  incapacity cases take a longer time to process  as\r\n\r\nthey require medical reports as a basis to determine\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  amount of compensation payable.  Medical reports usually\r\n\r\ntake  four  to  six months to be completed, as the  assessing\r\n\r\ndoctor  has  to be satisfied that the incapacity suffered  by\r\n\r\nthe  workman  has  stabilised and no further  improvement  or\r\n\r\ndeterioration is likely.  In some cases, medical  assessments\r\n\r\nhave  taken more than a year.  This is mainly because of  the\r\n\r\nseriousness  of  the  injuries.  The  length  of  time  taken\r\n\r\ndepends  also  on the speed of recovery of the  workman,  and\r\n\r\nthis  is something not within the Ministry's control.  It  is\r\n\r\nentirely in the hands of medical professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay mentioned that he has brought up some cases on\r\n\r\npermanent incapacity.  One involves the case of a welder  who\r\n\r\nsustained  serious arm injury during an accident at  work  on\r\n\r\n29th  July 1999.  His permanent incapacity was only  assessed\r\n\r\nby his doctor in December 2000, more than 16 months after the\r\n\r\naccident.  However, while his permanent incapacity was  being\r\n\r\nassessed,  he was paid temporary incapacity compensation  for\r\n\r\nthe  period he was on medical leave.  This is up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof  one  year.  His case has since been settled  and  he  has\r\n\r\nreceived  his compensation amounting to $22,050 on 7th  March\r\n\r\nthis year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other case involves a stevedore who sustained a\r\n\r\nserious  leg injury at work on 1st January 1999.  His  doctor\r\n\r\nonly  confirmed the permanent disability suffered by  him  in\r\n\r\nAugust 2000, ie, 20 months after the accident.  This case  is\r\n\r\ncomplicated  by the fact that the employer is  uninsured  and\r\n\r\nhas  denied that the injured workman is his direct  employee.\r\n\r\nSo  this case will have to be set before the Labour Court for\r\n\r\na determination, and hearing has been set for 26th April this\r\n\r\nyear.  Prosecution will be taken against the employer, if  it\r\n\r\nis  found that the injured worker is indeed his employee  and\r\n\r\nhe  has  failed  to  insure his workmen under  the  Workmen's\r\n\r\nCompensation Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry understands the concern that injured\r\n\r\nworkers  and their families may suffer hardship while waiting\r\n\r\nfor  their claims to be assessed.  However, I would  like  to\r\n\r\ninform the House that whilst\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwaiting  for  his  permanent incapacity to be  confirmed,  an\r\n\r\ninjured   workman   is   entitled  to  temporary   incapacity\r\n\r\ncompensation as provided for under the Workmen's Compensation\r\n\r\nAct.   For  this, he is entitled to full earnings  up  to  14\r\n\r\ndays, if granted outpatient sick leave, and up to another  60\r\n\r\ndays, if granted hospitalisation leave, giving a total  of  a\r\n\r\nmaximum  of  74  days altogether.  And,  if  he  still  needs\r\n\r\nmedical leave beyond this period, he would be entitled to 2/3\r\n\r\nof  his  wages up to one year, from the date of the accident.\r\n\r\nThis  means that he will have some compensation paid  to  him\r\n\r\nwhile  waiting  for his case to be settled.   These  payments\r\n\r\nwould  help  to  alleviate the financial  burden  of  injured\r\n\r\nworkers, pending the final outcome of their cases.  In  cases\r\n\r\nwhere  workmen  are unable to secure the TI  compensation  or\r\n\r\nwhere the medical leave exceeds one year, we normally help by\r\n\r\nreferring the case to the MCDS for financial assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry has been making conscious efforts to\r\n\r\nexpedite the settlement of claims and to ensure that payments\r\n\r\nof  compensation  are  made  within  the  legally  stipulated\r\n\r\ndeadlines.   A system to monitor all payments of compensation\r\n\r\nfor  fatal  and  PI claims, and to issue demand  letters  and\r\n\r\nreminders  where  payments are not made, was  implemented  in\r\n\r\nJune  1998.  Sir, we will continue to explore initiatives  to\r\n\r\nfurther  expedite  the  assessment  and  payment  of  claims.\r\n\r\nRecent  initiatives  undertaken by the Ministry  include  the\r\n\r\nredevelopment of the work injury compensation  system.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis system will be ready by the year 2002, and will help  to\r\n\r\nexpedite  claims by automating processes as far as  possible.\r\n\r\nIn  February 2001, the Ministry launched a training programme\r\n\r\nto  educate  employers  on their responsibilities  under  the\r\n\r\nWorkmen's  Compensation Act, ie, to insure their workmen  and\r\n\r\nto report the accidents on time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also reviewing the Act to put in place\r\n\r\nmeasures  and  penalties to deter practices which  delay  the\r\n\r\nsettlement of claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Minister\r\n\r\nfor his reply, and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (6), Mr Chay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head T of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code TM 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has announced that we will\r\n\r\nbe   spending   $30  million  on  the  Manpower   Development\r\n\r\nAssistance Scheme this year to help everyone in the workforce\r\n\r\nupgrade their skills and knowledge.  Essentially, this  is  a\r\n\r\nco-funding  scheme for skills redevelopment  training,  life-long  learning  and strategic conversion.  I  will  stick  to\r\n\r\nskills redevelopment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redevelop our workers' skills, they have to undergo\r\n\r\nsome course or programme at some stage, at our ITE, presently\r\n\r\nat  Bukit Merah.  They will also have to make an application,\r\n\r\nthen  they  will  have  to  go and look  for  some  surrogate\r\n\r\nemployers  to  get  funding from CDC or  NTUC  for  approval.\r\n\r\nThese  programmes will be modular and recognised towards  the\r\n\r\nskills set for skills recognition.  As this is something that\r\n\r\nis  going  to  be  life-long,  can  we  not  get  the  Skills\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Programme Centre to be a one-stop  centre  that\r\n\r\nis  visibly  present in all the heartlands, bearing  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat the larger workforce that we are targeting at would have\r\n\r\nto  apply,  and we need time to process and also we  need  to\r\n\r\nminimise   the  inconvenience  to  them?   These  application\r\n\r\ncentres  could be widely permeated at the community level  so\r\n\r\nthat  members  of  the  community would  know  of  its  ready\r\n\r\navailability  and its ease of application.  It should  be  as\r\n\r\neasy as signing up for a course at the CC.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these skills redevelopment application\r\n\r\ncentres  that I have mentioned, the training centres can,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  be differently located because they need specialised\r\n\r\nequipment.   With the visible presence of these SRP  centres,\r\n\r\nwe can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nreinforce  this life-long learning culture in the  community,\r\n\r\nserving  its  purpose of life-long skills  redevelopment  and\r\n\r\nretraining.\r\n\r\n<br>2.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe:</b> Sir, Mr Chay has\r\n\r\nhighlighted the need for training opportunities and  also  to\r\n\r\nmake   them   easily   accessible,  and  he   suggested   the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of  a  one-stop facility,  especially  at  the\r\n\r\ncommunity level, to help workers get training. We also  share\r\n\r\nhis  concern.  In fact, we have set up, in last July, a  one-stop career centre and the centre aims to help individuals to\r\n\r\nmake  better employment and training decisions, and  also  to\r\n\r\nhelp  offer  employment assistance and coaching  services  to\r\n\r\nthose  who require help in securing employment.  To  make  it\r\n\r\nmore convenient, we are developing a Career Associate Network\r\n\r\nwith like-minded organisations, such as self-help groups  and\r\n\r\nthe  community bodies, to set up similar facilities at  other\r\n\r\nlocations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Merah Skills Development Centre is an old ITE\r\n\r\ncentre.   It is now open and we will open similar centres  in\r\n\r\nother  locations  and  work together  with  community  clubs,\r\n\r\ncommunity centres, as well as Residents Committees, to  bring\r\n\r\nactual  training  courses further down the  community  level,\r\n\r\nparticularly, as he mentioned, SRP training.  In fact, during\r\n\r\nthe   last   economic  downturn,  we  worked  with  Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Councils  and the NTUC  to  make  available  job\r\n\r\nassistance and also organised employment facilitation  events\r\n\r\nat  the  community  level, and this  includes  ensuring  that\r\n\r\nworkers  have  opportunities to  attend  SRP  training.   The\r\n\r\nconcern  is not so much on the existence of these facilities.\r\n\r\nThis  has  been addressed in the earlier part of the  debate,\r\n\r\nbut how we change mindsets, particularly of our older workers\r\n\r\nand  of employers and how to get them to bring themselves  to\r\n\r\nmake  better  use  of  facilities that  are  available.  This\r\n\r\nrequires the help, not only of the employers and the  unions,\r\n\r\nbut  I  think,  the general community.  We need  to  get  the\r\n\r\nmessage  down  that  whatever  employment  they  are  in,  it\r\n\r\nrequires them to upgrade their skills and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\neducation.   This mindset change, this psychological  change,\r\n\r\nis very necessary.  While we will provide and expand on these\r\n\r\nfacilities with the $200 million MDAS fund, we will  continue\r\n\r\nto make it more readily available for them to make use of all\r\n\r\nthe facilities, community centres, IT centres and expand them\r\n\r\nas best as we can. At the end of it, we must get the workers,\r\n\r\nparticularly the older workers, to make use of these training\r\n\r\nfacilities that are available and to make better use  of  the\r\n\r\nopportunities to be trained.  I think this is  the  only  way\r\n\r\nwhereby they can continue to remain employable and also enjoy\r\n\r\nbetter careers and better jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw the\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang</b> rose ---\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Lee, on what point are you rising?

For  being\r\n\r\nthe  \"little red dot\" on the one hand, and on the  other,  of\r\n\r\nbeing the over dominant port.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let it be known that Singapore has the interests of\r\n\r\nthe region at heart.  We cannot relocate and shift out of the\r\n\r\nregion.   We  are here, for better or for worse, we  are  all\r\n\r\npart  and  parcel of the region.  If the region prospers,  we\r\n\r\nwill  also  prosper.  It is, therefore, in our interest  that\r\n\r\nour  neighbours  prosper.  It is a  win-win  situation.   Our\r\n\r\nmotto, therefore, is \"Prosper thy neighbour\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important issue is the distribution and balance of\r\n\r\npower in the region.  This is of key strategic concern to all\r\n\r\nthe  countries.  There is consensus that in the post Cold War\r\n\r\nera, the strategic situation is not bipolar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two perspectives on this. One is that of an\r\n\r\nemerging  multi-polarity,  with  the  United  States,  China,\r\n\r\nJapan, Russia and India as players.  In theory, China, Russia\r\n\r\nand  others  could form a coalition to balance  the  US-Japan\r\n\r\nalliance, should the latter grow too domineering.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other perspective is an American pre-eminence, which\r\n\r\nis the present trend, but one that is not accepted readily by\r\n\r\nChina, India and Russia.  There is,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntherefore,  this tension which is manifested in  the  various\r\n\r\ndiplomatic offensives in recent years, particularly by  China\r\n\r\nand  India, and more recently, by Russia, and the debate over\r\n\r\nthe National Missile Defence (NMD).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the horizon, all notice that China is emerging as\r\n\r\na  great  power,  and the Americans are increasingly  viewing\r\n\r\nBeijing  as  a strategic rival.  Japan appears to be  slowly,\r\n\r\nbut  surely,  shedding  its post-war inhibitions  to  play  a\r\n\r\nlarger  role  in the Asia Pacific region. Sir,  what  is  the\r\n\r\nlikely  impact  on Southeast Asia if all these  great  powers\r\n\r\nwere to assert themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Asia and Pacific, therefore, we will be affected one\r\n\r\nway   or   the  other  by  any  changes  in  this  triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship of the United States, China and Japan.  In fact,\r\n\r\nChina  recently increased its defence expenditure  by  nearly\r\n\r\n18%. The US expressed its concern, and said it would continue\r\n\r\nto  sell weapons to Taiwan.  How will China conduct its trade\r\n\r\nand  foreign  relations after its entry into the World  Trade\r\n\r\nOrganisation?   The  answer  to this  question  would  surely\r\n\r\naffect the power configuration in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we now have a new Republican President in the White\r\n\r\nHouse.  Will  President George W Bush and his  team  be  more\r\n\r\nsympathetic  to  Taiwan  and be more critical  of  the  human\r\n\r\nrights  situation  in  China?  Will the  US  continue  to  be\r\n\r\nengaged in the region, maintain its military presence and fly\r\n\r\nthe flag, and thereby play a role in the balance of power  in\r\n\r\nthe region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Southeast Asian region is beset with economic\r\n\r\nproblems  and traumatized by internal upheavals.  Governments\r\n\r\ncome and go swiftly, and in some parts, no one is sure who is\r\n\r\nin  power.   Singapore  is in danger, or  in  the  unenviable\r\n\r\nposition, of being the good house in a bad neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Control Risks Group, which assesses a country's\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  political risks, reports  that:   \"Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy and much of its prosperity is dependent\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\non  it  serving as a haven between the increasingly turbulent\r\n\r\nregion.   While  the  Singapore  Government  can  manage  the\r\n\r\ninternal  implications of this paradox, it can do  little  to\r\n\r\nalter the powerful political and social forces affecting such\r\n\r\nkey   neighbours  as  Indonesia  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,\r\n\r\nMalaysia.\"   The challenge for Singapore then is  to  balance\r\n\r\nthe  needs of foreign investors seeking a secure base in  the\r\n\r\nregion, while maintaining good relations with often difficult\r\n\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is an oasis of peace and stability, but\r\n\r\nsome neighbours are still reeling from the after-shock of the\r\n\r\nAsian economic crisis. The Chinese character for crisis, \"wei\r\n\r\nchi\",  projects  danger  as well as opportunity.   There  are\r\n\r\nelements of opportunity of hope in the midst of danger.   How\r\n\r\ncan Singapore then minimise the impact of danger and maximise\r\n\r\nthat of opportunity for progress?  This is not dissimilar  to\r\n\r\nthe  English  proverb  that every dark  cloud  has  a  silver\r\n\r\nlining.   These  axioms from both East and West  are  perhaps\r\n\r\nhelpful  or  instructive when we view the regional turbulence\r\n\r\nswirling around us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister for his\r\n\r\nstrategic  overview  and  assessment  of  the  problems   and\r\n\r\nprospects in our region.  I hope the Minister can give  us  a\r\n\r\nforecast of likely political storms, and tell us if there  is\r\n\r\nany  chance of sunshine or rainbow breaking out in the region\r\n\r\nin the coming years.  I know that it is difficult to forecast\r\n\r\nthe  political weather.  Political turbulence,  by  its  very\r\n\r\nnature, is very unpredictable.  It would be helpful, however,\r\n\r\nif  the  Minister can give us his assessment of the political\r\n\r\nweather  and  chart  out  for us the rocks  and  the  shallow\r\n\r\nwaters.  How can Singapore sail through potentially dangerous\r\n\r\nwaters?   What  can  we  do  as a nation  to  promote  peace,\r\n\r\nstability  and security in our region?  Further, how  can  we\r\n\r\nshare and educate Singaporeans on the dangers and pitfalls in\r\n\r\nthe region, without alarming the public and the investors?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ASEAN has featured prominently these last 30 years\r\n\r\nin   matters  of  peace  and  stability  in  Southeast  Asia.\r\n\r\nHowever, since\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  financial  crisis,  questions  have  been  raised  about\r\n\r\nASEAN's very future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent leadership changes in the ASEAN countries,\r\n\r\nand  the  rapid  admission of new members  into  ASEAN,  have\r\n\r\nprompted  analysts  around the world to doubt  whether  ASEAN\r\n\r\nitself will be able to act cohesively, and expeditiously.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic political stability and political\r\n\r\ntransition  in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand  and,  to\r\n\r\nsome  extent, Malaysia, have cast a shadow over the prestige,\r\n\r\nclout  and  capability of ASEAN and its ability  to  maintain\r\n\r\nregional   stability  and  play  a  positive  role   in   the\r\n\r\ninternational arena.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has ASEAN become too large with 10 members, though some\r\n\r\nmay   say  it  is  perfect  10?  The  question  is:   is   it\r\n\r\nincreasingly difficult for ASEAN to speak with one  voice  in\r\n\r\nthe  world  forum?  ASEAN has been a useful vehicle  for  the\r\n\r\ncountries in the region and it is imperative for all  the  10\r\n\r\nASEAN countries to ensure that it remains so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge is, therefore, on how to reinvent and\r\n\r\nreinvigorate ASEAN, so that it can play new roles in the  new\r\n\r\nmillennium,  forge  unity amongst member countries  and  work\r\n\r\ntowards  the  promotion  of  peace,  stability  and  economic\r\n\r\nprogress in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish, in particular, to ask the Minister for his\r\n\r\nassessment  on the outcome of the ASEAN Informal Summit  held\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  recently and the recent ASEAN-EC  meeting,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as his comments on the ASEAN+3 formula, ie, ASEAN  plus\r\n\r\nChina,  Japan and South Korea, whether ASEAN+3 will take  off\r\n\r\nand become a platform for action in the future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is: has political uncertainty impaired\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN Regional Forum, the only multilateral platform  in\r\n\r\nAsia-Pacific, to address security issues?  Has the  ARF  been\r\n\r\nable   to   move  beyond  confidence-building  to  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy in its role?  Is there still a role for the ARF  to\r\n\r\naddress  the  security  issues and the problems  of  regional\r\n\r\nhotspots in the Asia-Pacific region?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, many of the ASEAN\r\n\r\nmembers  are still recovering from the 1997 economic  crisis.\r\n\r\nThere  is  still  great  disparity in  social,  economic  and\r\n\r\npolitical developments in the various ASEAN countries.  There\r\n\r\nis  even  a  perception amongst observers  that  ASEAN  lacks\r\n\r\ndynamism  and  unity of purpose because of members'  internal\r\n\r\nproblems  and  priorities.  In addition, it has become  clear\r\n\r\nthat  Northeast  Asia has become the new centre  for  foreign\r\n\r\ndirect  investments. With China's entry into the World  Trade\r\n\r\nOrganisation,  we  can see a bigger pool of investments  from\r\n\r\nSoutheast Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister for an update on\r\n\r\nthe  state of affairs within ASEAN.  In particular,  I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister on how ASEAN is coordinating  to\r\n\r\nattract foreign direct investments to the region.\r\n\r\n<br>2.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister on the\r\n\r\nprospects  for the ASEAN+3 process developing into some  kind\r\n\r\nof  an East Asia summit.  In particular, I would like to  ask\r\n\r\nthe Minister whether ASEAN would lose its identity in such an\r\n\r\nEast  Asian summit where it can be overwhelmed by the  larger\r\n\r\nEast Asian countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, in the late 1990s, we found an\r\n\r\nASEAN  vastly different in spirit from the ASEAN of the early\r\n\r\n1990s.   In  the early 1990s, ASEAN was held up as  the  next\r\n\r\nbest example of regional cooperation, next to the EU.  It was\r\n\r\nconfident,  bold,  innovative  and  taking  active  steps  to\r\n\r\nstrengthen  its  regional cooperation and cohesiveness.   One\r\n\r\nsuch  example  was the formation of the ASEAN Regional  Forum\r\n\r\n(ARF)  in  1994,  which sought to be the forum  for  regional\r\n\r\nsecurity  cooperation and activity.  The early  1990s  saw  a\r\n\r\nperiod  of  high  growth rates for all ASEAN  countries,  and\r\n\r\nthere was a feeling of euphoria, and ASEAN was respected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic crisis of 1997/1998 and its lingering\r\n\r\neffects on many individual\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries  would appear to have dented  the  unity  of\r\n\r\nASEAN  states,  as  political and  economic  instability  has\r\n\r\nforced  each  member state to become more involved  in  their\r\n\r\ninternal  affairs,  at  the expense of regional  cooperation.\r\n\r\nInstead  of  coming together, the economic crisis  seemed  to\r\n\r\nhave  pushed  ASEAN states apart, and they  are  focusing  on\r\n\r\ntheir own internal problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could the Minister give us his views on the state\r\n\r\nof cohesiveness and unity currently within ASEAN?  This is  a\r\n\r\ncritical time for ASEAN with the inclusion of four new member\r\n\r\nstates  in  the last five years, especially since  these  new\r\n\r\nmember  states  are also economically under  developed.   How\r\n\r\nhave  the  older  ASEAN states been able to  help  these  new\r\n\r\nmembers to integrate?  Can the Minister comment on how  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncan  prevent  a  two-tier split into  the  economically  more\r\n\r\ndeveloped regional members of ASEAN on the one hand, and  the\r\n\r\neconomically less developed new members on the other?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, I thank Dr Ong Chit Chung, Chairman of the GPC, Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran and Mr Hawazi for their comments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first touch on Dr Ong Chit Chung's points about\r\n\r\nthe overview of the strategic situation in our region. He  is\r\n\r\nright when he says that there have been very dramatic changes\r\n\r\nin  the  regional landscape.  The South East Asian region  is\r\n\r\ngoing through very troubled and uncertain times.  North Asia,\r\n\r\nas some Members pointed out, is proving to be more attractive\r\n\r\nto  investors.  There is a new administration in  the  United\r\n\r\nStates.   There  are old flashpoints such as  the  unresolved\r\n\r\ndisputes  in South China Sea and the cross strait  relations,\r\n\r\nwhich  have  not disappeared.  And we have also  seen  inter-ethnic tensions in various places in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was listening to the debate in the past few days on\r\n\r\nMTI  as  well as the Ministry of Defence, there were  certain\r\n\r\nrecurring  themes by both the Members and the  Ministers  who\r\n\r\nreplied.  The\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrecurring  theme was precisely about the uncertain  strategic\r\n\r\nsituation we find ourselves in.  And now again, in MFA,  this\r\n\r\npoint  is raised.  What does it show?  I think it shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  regional  backdrop is relevant, not just one  aspect  of\r\n\r\nSingapore's development, it affects many facets of  Singapore\r\n\r\n-  economic, security and defence, as well as foreign policy.\r\n\r\nWe   are   affected   by   the   external   environment   and\r\n\r\ncircumstances, many of which are beyond our control.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked me to forecast the political\r\n\r\nweather.   How  I wish we had a crystal ball!  There  are  so\r\n\r\nmany  developments in countries around us,  the  outcomes  of\r\n\r\nwhich are uncertain, but the outcomes of which will certainly\r\n\r\naffect  us, to a lesser or greater degree.  All I can say  is\r\n\r\nthat we have to be alert to the external developments and  in\r\n\r\nvarious  facets  of our policies, we have  to  be  agile  and\r\n\r\nnimble in making adjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members rightly pointed out that the region in South\r\n\r\nEast Asia is going through a very difficult period.  Even  as\r\n\r\nwe  speak  now, today, ASEAN's largest member, Indonesia,  is\r\n\r\ngrappling  with  serious  domestic,  political  and  economic\r\n\r\nproblems.  With recent changes in government, the Philippines\r\n\r\nand  Thailand have also seen the emergence of new leaders  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  Foreign  Ministers.  With all these  uncertainties,\r\n\r\npolitical   and  economic  problems  taking  place,   foreign\r\n\r\ninvestor confidence has yet to return to the region.   But  I\r\n\r\nwould say, in reply to those who spoke about ASEAN, Singapore\r\n\r\nis  committed  to  ASEAN, and we will  work  with  others  to\r\n\r\novercome the present difficulties, to keep ASEAN on track  in\r\n\r\nimportant  projects,  such as AFTA.  At the  fourth  informal\r\n\r\nsummit  in  Singapore,  there was an  agreement  amongst  the\r\n\r\nleaders,  but also amongst the ASEAN+3, to cooperate  towards\r\n\r\nintegration of ASEAN.  I will come to this in a moment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our limited resources, Singapore tries to play\r\n\r\nthe  role of a catalyst in ASEAN's recovery, and we  do  this\r\n\r\nthrough  various projects, such as the initiative  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\nintegration, the e-ASEAN initiative\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto help all of ASEAN engage in the new economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer home to Singapore, we are witnessing political\r\n\r\nchanges  in  both  our neighbouring countries.   As  I  said,\r\n\r\nIndonesia  is undergoing a difficult political transition  in\r\n\r\nthe  face of economic, social, religious and ethnic problems.\r\n\r\nSuch  pressures have caused Indonesian leaders  sometimes  to\r\n\r\nlash out against us from time to time.  But Members will note\r\n\r\nthat  we  have  not reacted emotionally.   We  have  put  out\r\n\r\nmeasured factual statements setting out our position  on  the\r\n\r\nfacts.   We  have to take a long-term view of  our  relations\r\n\r\nwith Indonesia, and we will continue to approach relations in\r\n\r\na calm and measured manner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia, we are also witnessing political changes,\r\n\r\nand  as  Malaysia deals with its domestic challenges, Members\r\n\r\nwould  have  also noted the series of ups and  downs  in  our\r\n\r\nrelations with them in the past year.  Notwithstanding  these\r\n\r\nevents,  the leaders of both sides have maintained close  and\r\n\r\nfrequent  contacts  and have been able  to  put  such  issues\r\n\r\nbehind  us quickly in favour of moving ahead in our bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.    With  both  Indonesia  and  Malaysia,   despite\r\n\r\noccasional  differences, which are unavoidable  because  they\r\n\r\nare  close  neighbours, let me say that we will  continue  to\r\n\r\nbuild  on  our relations on the basis of sovereign  equality,\r\n\r\nand  we  will  cooperate  wherever  possible  towards  mutual\r\n\r\nbenefit.   I  have noted what Dr Ong Chit Chung  said  and  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that it must be on the basis of prosper-thy-neighbour.  And indeed we believe that such contribution  can\r\n\r\ncontribute  towards  lifting  our  region  from  its  current\r\n\r\nuncertainties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung pointed out that North East Asia is\r\n\r\nshowing  good  signs of economic growth and healthy  recovery\r\n\r\nfrom  the  economic  crisis.   The  tensions  in  the  Korean\r\n\r\nPeninsula   have   been  easing  in  the  past   year.    Not\r\n\r\nsurprisingly, therefore, foreign investors are more attracted\r\n\r\nto  North  East  Asia  than South  East  Asia,  and  this  is\r\n\r\nprecisely  what I have flagged to my colleagues in the  ASEAN\r\n\r\nForeign Ministers' meeting, that we have to take\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnote  and we have to get our act together in ASEAN.   China's\r\n\r\nimpending entry into the WTO will also present challenges and\r\n\r\nopportunities for countries in this region.  Let me add  also\r\n\r\nthat  India  is also rising as an economic force  with  their\r\n\r\ncentres of excellence in the field of information technology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung mentioned the United States\r\n\r\nadministration.  Their key foreign policy directions have yet\r\n\r\nto  be revealed, but it appears that they will remain engaged\r\n\r\nand committed in Asia.  US policy in Asia, I completely agree\r\n\r\nwith  Dr  Ong Chit Chung, will affect the existing triangular\r\n\r\nrelationship  between the US, China and Japan, a relationship\r\n\r\nwhich  underpins the strategic situation in the Asia-Pacific.\r\n\r\nSo we have to monitor this closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are some of the matters in the radar\r\n\r\nscreen,   so   to   speak.   With  all  these   changes   and\r\n\r\nuncertainties taking place in this region, what can we do  in\r\n\r\nthese uncertain times?  I think there is no point in wringing\r\n\r\nour  hands  and lamenting on the problems in the region.   So\r\n\r\nduring  this interregnum in ASEAN, I believe we  have  to  be\r\n\r\nforward  looking  and to work with like-minded  countries  in\r\n\r\nASEAN  as well as some of our dialogue partners to keep ASEAN\r\n\r\non  track, and we have to prepare for the day when the region\r\n\r\nrecovers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have to take a twin track approach, what Dr\r\n\r\nOng Chit Chung referred to as a balancing approach.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  while  we take a long-term view of our commitment  to\r\n\r\nASEAN,  we also have to press ahead in reaching out to  other\r\n\r\nkey  countries  and economies in the world.   Being  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  in  an  increasingly globalised world,  we  have  no\r\n\r\nchoice  but  to engage global markets to make the  world  our\r\n\r\nhinterland.  This is not new and has been our approach for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time.  I would say, together, these two facets make  up\r\n\r\nthe  twin track approach in our foreign policy.  ASEAN is  of\r\n\r\nprimary importance, but of equal significance is our need  to\r\n\r\nreach out and engage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith the rest of the world.  Let me say that Singapore's  FTA\r\n\r\nnegotiations with Australia, Japan, Mexico, New  Zealand  and\r\n\r\nthe  United States can be said to come under this other  part\r\n\r\nof our twin track approach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung made an interesting point when he said\r\n\r\nthat it is important for our people to be knowledgeable about\r\n\r\nwhat  is  happening in the region.  I completely  agree  with\r\n\r\nhim.   Why  do  I  agree with him?  Because of  the  external\r\n\r\nsituation we find ourselves in, and it will definitely affect\r\n\r\nSingapore.  I  think Singaporeans, as a community,  ought  to\r\n\r\ntake  an  interest  in what is happening beyond  our  shores,\r\n\r\nespecially in our immediate region.   And if Singaporeans  at\r\n\r\nlarge  are well acquainted with the issues in our region  and\r\n\r\nhave a realistic view of developments, I believe they will be\r\n\r\nbetter  equipped  to  deal with any  developments  that  take\r\n\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me turn to the various comments made about\r\n\r\nASEAN.   I would start, first, by recounting why is  it  that\r\n\r\nmany  commentators and writers dubbed ASEAN, some years  ago,\r\n\r\nas  one  of  the  most successful regional groupings  in  the\r\n\r\nworld.   I  think there were two reasons.  First  members  of\r\n\r\nASEAN were doing well economically.  Some were dubbed as  the\r\n\r\n\"tigers\" or rising economies in Asia.  Secondly, most of  the\r\n\r\ncountries  were experiencing periods of political  stability.\r\n\r\nWith the regional crisis, things have changed.  Countries are\r\n\r\nexperiencing  both  political and economic uncertainties  and\r\n\r\ninstability.   So  if  you ask me now, I  think  it  will  be\r\n\r\nmisleading to paint any rosy picture for ASEAN.  In fact,  at\r\n\r\nlast year's ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting, Singapore made\r\n\r\na  speech  which  was described aptly as a wake-up  call  for\r\n\r\nASEAN.  But, at the same time, I would caution against taking\r\n\r\nan unduly pessimistic view of ASEAN.  We have to view matters\r\n\r\nin  historical  perspective.  And when we look  back  at  the\r\n\r\ninitial  years  after  ASEAN was  founded,  there  were  many\r\n\r\npundits who predicted that ASEAN would not last more  than  a\r\n\r\nfew  years.   They described ASEAN as being  a  group  of  so\r\n\r\ndisparate countries, so divergent, that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe were the \"Balkans of Asia\".  But we have lasted, developed\r\n\r\nand evolved into the organisation that we are now.\r\n\r\n<br>2.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ASEAN continues to remain a resilient organisation. It\r\n\r\nhas  nurtured certain habits of cooperation.  There are  some\r\n\r\ngood institutions in ASEAN beyond the meetings of the Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters.   There are the meetings of the Finance,  Economic\r\n\r\nand  Environment Ministers.  Through this network of meetings\r\n\r\nbetween  Ministers  and officials, there has  been  over  the\r\n\r\nyears   a  certain  camaraderie,  understanding  and  working\r\n\r\nrelationship  between ASEAN leaders and officials.   I  think\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  meetings are also important for this interaction.\r\n\r\nWe  agreed  last  year that we should cut  down  as  much  as\r\n\r\npossible  the  pomp, the ceremonial part of ASEAN,  and  move\r\n\r\ninto  a  more business-like functional mode.   Therefore,  we\r\n\r\nhave held retreats, sometimes without officials.  And we have\r\n\r\nalso  agreed  that  in between the annual Foreign  Ministers'\r\n\r\nmeeting, there will be a meeting of Ministers in Retreat, and\r\n\r\nthis will be held sometime soon.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will repeat that Singapore will work with others in\r\n\r\nASEAN during this interregnum.  During this interregnum, what\r\n\r\nis  essential  is to keep the organisation together.   It  is\r\n\r\nimportant  because  there  are many  new  leaders,  many  new\r\n\r\nForeign Ministers, who have emerged in ASEAN, and we have  to\r\n\r\nstay on track on important initiatives like AFTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members asked about the recent informal summit which we\r\n\r\nhosted  in  Singapore.  I think that it  was  a  very  useful\r\n\r\nmeeting, coming as it did, during this uncertain period.  The\r\n\r\nleaders  set  clear  directions by making  ASEAN  integration\r\n\r\ntheir  priority.  Another point that was emphasised just  now\r\n\r\nwas on how do we avoid a two-tier ASEAN.  Working closely  to\r\n\r\nintegrate  our  10  markets  and  making  our  economy   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive  will certainly help reduce the gap within  ASEAN\r\n\r\nand  make ourselves more cohesive.  There was agreement  that\r\n\r\nthose who are better off should help the less\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeveloped in ASEAN.  As far as Singapore is concerned, we are\r\n\r\nfully  committed  to working with ASEAN to  assist  the  CLMV\r\n\r\ncountries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the leaders agreed on an important\r\n\r\nproject  called  the \"Initiative for ASEAN Integration\".   To\r\n\r\ncatalyse  this initiative, Singapore proposed  a  package  of\r\n\r\nproposals  on human resource development, education  and  IT.\r\n\r\nThe  leaders  also signed the e-ASEAN framework agreement  as\r\n\r\nASEAN's  clear response to the global information revolution.\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister Goh argued that e-ASEAN would transform ASEAN\r\n\r\ninto  one  seamless  and  borderless market,  instead  of  10\r\n\r\nfragmented markets.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not go too great into the details of the\r\n\r\nInitiative  for ASEAN Integration.  But let me say  that  the\r\n\r\npackage of proposals announced by the Prime Minister  at  the\r\n\r\ninformal  summit is made up of two parts: skills  development\r\n\r\nand  educational development, which will stretch over a five-year  period involving $59.5 million.  It involves,  firstly,\r\n\r\nskills  development training institutes being established  in\r\n\r\nCambodia,  Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.  Secondly, a  five-year\r\n\r\npackage   of  IT  \"Train-the-Trainers\"  courses   for   these\r\n\r\ncountries.   Thirdly,  an  Education  \"Train-the-   Trainers\"\r\n\r\nProgramme,  focusing  on  teacher  and  trainer  development.\r\n\r\nFourthly, doubling the number of Singapore scholarships under\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Cooperation  Programme  from  30  to  60  per\r\n\r\nacademic  year.   Finally,  they are  also  planning  student\r\n\r\nexchange  programmes  at  both  secondary  school  and  youth\r\n\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of ASEAN touched on by Members is ARF. I\r\n\r\nwould  say  that the ARF remains a very important  forum  for\r\n\r\ndiscussing  security-related issues in  South-east  Asia  and\r\n\r\nASEAN.   This is driven by ASEAN because every ARF is chaired\r\n\r\nby  ASEAN.   What  are  the prospects for ARF's  development?\r\n\r\nFrom  Singapore's point of view, we want to nudge  ASEAN  and\r\n\r\nother  countries  to  move the ARF faster towards  preventive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.  In other words, move from the stage of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nconfidence-building measures to preventive diplomacy.  But we\r\n\r\nalso have to be cognisant of the fact that we must do so at a\r\n\r\npace  comfortable to other members of the ARF.   So  we  will\r\n\r\nwith  others  see how we can get a consensus to advance  from\r\n\r\nconfidence-building measures to preventive diplomacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about ASEAN-European Union\r\n\r\nmeeting.   As  you  know, this meeting was stalled  for  some\r\n\r\ntime.   It  was  to be held in Europe.  There was  a  problem\r\n\r\nbecause  the Europeans, due to the common policy on  Myanmar,\r\n\r\ndeclined  to give a visa to the Foreign Minister of  Myanmar.\r\n\r\nASEAN,  of  course, would not allow itself to be divided  and\r\n\r\nturned  up  there without Myanmar.  So there was an  impasse.\r\n\r\nThere were discussions which led to this formula, leading  to\r\n\r\nthe  ASEAN  and  EU Foreign Ministers' Meeting in  Vientiane.\r\n\r\nThe  meeting  proceeded with all the ASEAN Foreign  Ministers\r\n\r\nbeing  there, including Myanmar.  Our approach to the EU  was\r\n\r\nthat  if  they  had a problem with Myanmar,  if  they  had  a\r\n\r\nforeign  policy about Myanmar, by all means, engage  Myanmar,\r\n\r\nbut  do  not  let that derail or jeopardise the long-standing\r\n\r\nASEAN-EU   relationship.   I  believe  this  call  struck   a\r\n\r\nresonance with many members, as a result of which, after  the\r\n\r\nASEAN-EU meeting in Vientiane, they have agreed that the next\r\n\r\nmeeting will be held in Europe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ASEAN+3 process, it has been going on for some\r\n\r\ntime.   In  other  words,  it is held back-to-back  with  the\r\n\r\nSummit, where ASEAN leaders meet with Japan, China and Korea,\r\n\r\nseparately  as  well as collectively.  Members asked  whether\r\n\r\nthis  would  lead,  in future, to closer cooperation  between\r\n\r\nASEAN and the plus-three countries.  I would say, yes, it  is\r\n\r\nalready  happening, and these meetings that we have  annually\r\n\r\nsymbolise  the close cooperation between ASEAN and the  plus-three  countries.  With each country (Japan, China or Korea),\r\n\r\nsitting  down  with  ASEAN,  we  review  many  projects   for\r\n\r\ncollaboration and cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an East Asian Summit, of course, merits\r\n\r\nconsideration in the longer term.  In principle, I  think  it\r\n\r\nis a good idea, but our preference is for a gradual approach.\r\n\r\nBecause,  as  Mr  Ravindran mentioned, there are  some  ASEAN\r\n\r\ncountries  who  are  concerned about the  plus-three  process\r\n\r\nbecoming  an  East  Asian Summit too  quickly.   We  need  to\r\n\r\naddress this and build up comfort level in the process,  both\r\n\r\nwithin  ASEAN and among the plus-three countries.  It is  not\r\n\r\njust  a  question  as  to  whether it will  diminish  ASEAN's\r\n\r\nrelevance  and  role  in East Asia.  But for  the  plus-three\r\n\r\nprocess and the summit to take place, ASEAN, first, will have\r\n\r\nto establish itself again and get its act together.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, Singapore and Malaysia are\r\n\r\nclose  neighbours.  Some say too close for comfort.   But  we\r\n\r\ncannot  escape the proximity imposed by geography  nor  alter\r\n\r\nour  historical  past.   Willy-nilly,  we  have  to  live  as\r\n\r\nneighbours, as best as we can be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore-Malaysia relations have been characterised as\r\n\r\ntwo  neighbours living in semi-detached houses, but separated\r\n\r\nby  a  common  wall, as the Malaysian Deputy  Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nDatuk Seri Abdullah Badawi puts it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or as Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong amplifies, it is like\r\n\r\nliving   in  two  semi-detached  houses  located   within   a\r\n\r\ncondominium estate and sharing common facilities, with common\r\n\r\nresponsibility  as well.  In such a setting,  the  neighbours\r\n\r\nget together to socialise and build up friendship and get  to\r\n\r\nunderstand and appreciate each other better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, relationship between Singapore and Malaysia\r\n\r\nhas  its ups and downs.   The bottomline is that it is in the\r\n\r\ninterest  of  both countries to work together to resolve  any\r\n\r\ndifficulty  and build up our common ground and understanding.\r\n\r\nAll  can  be winners together.  It can be a win-win situation\r\n\r\nfor both.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent visit to Singapore, the Malaysian Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, Datuk\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSeri  Abdullah  Badawi said, \"Singapore and  Malaysia  should\r\n\r\nimprove  our trade relations, to prosper together and  ensure\r\n\r\npeace  in the region.\"  In this context, we learn with  great\r\n\r\ninterest  that  Singapore  and Malaysia  are  continuing  the\r\n\r\nnegotiation on the package of outstanding issues between  the\r\n\r\ntwo  countries, and Singapore has agreed to extend  the  10th\r\n\r\nFebruary  2001  deadline for the relocation  of  the  Malayan\r\n\r\nRailway station in Tanjong Pagar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent interview with the press, Prime Minister Goh\r\n\r\nChok  Tong said that \"we have given our proposal to  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand we have informal feedback that they are responding to the\r\n\r\nproposal.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore wish to ask the Minister on the progress and\r\n\r\noutcome  of  such negotiations, and when does he  expect  the\r\n\r\nnegotiations to be concluded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the recent visit by the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Malaysia to Singapore has created  a  sense  of\r\n\r\noptimism  that  the bilateral relationship  between  our  two\r\n\r\ncountries  has turned around for the better.  At the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  visit, the Malaysian DPM also indicated that outstanding\r\n\r\nbilateral  issues  could  be  resolved  with  some   urgency.\r\n\r\nHowever, no deadline has been disclosed for the resolution of\r\n\r\nthe outstanding bilateral issues by both sides.  I would like\r\n\r\nto  ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give an update on\r\n\r\nthe  state  of  bilateral relations with  Malaysia  and  also\r\n\r\nwhether any deadline has been set for the resolution of these\r\n\r\noutstanding issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, the points that I\r\n\r\nwanted   to  raise  on  the  bilateral  agreement  with   the\r\n\r\nMalaysians  have already been addressed by Dr Ong Chit  Chung\r\n\r\nand  Mr Ravindran.

With the recent visit of\r\n\r\nthe  Malaysia's  Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk  Seri  Abdullah\r\n\r\nBadawi,  to  Singapore,  the  relationship  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries has taken a notch up.  I am certain that with  more\r\n\r\nvisits  of  officials  of  one  country  to  the  other,  the\r\n\r\nrelationship  between Singapore and Malaysia  can  be  better\r\n\r\nimproved.   So far, we can see that the visits are only  made\r\n\r\nby  the very top officials of one country to the other.   The\r\n\r\nSenior Minister visited Malaysia last year and this year, the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Deputy Prime Minister reciprocated  the  visit  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are seven MPs who are speaking on this\r\n\r\namendment  on  Singapore  and Malaysia  relations  and  I  am\r\n\r\ncertain that all the points that I shall be speaking on  this\r\n\r\namendment shall be covered by the other speakers.  So I shall\r\n\r\nonly use this opportunity to make one proposal to advance the\r\n\r\ncause  of  Singapore-Malaysia relations.   I  would  like  to\r\n\r\npropose   that   our   Government  approach   the   Malaysian\r\n\r\ncounterparts  to arrange on a regular basis,  say,  annually,\r\n\r\nfriendly  visits and friendly games between the officials  of\r\n\r\nthe Government institutions, departments and statutory boards\r\n\r\nand Members of Parliament of the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal is nothing new. Amongst the lawyers,\r\n\r\nlawyers  and  judges of our two countries  have  already  had\r\n\r\nregular annual friendly games for many years.  Our Members of\r\n\r\nParliament  had, in fact, several years ago, as  I  remember,\r\n\r\nfriendly games meet with Members of the Malaysian Parliament.\r\n\r\nI do not know why that friendly games meet was not continued.\r\n\r\nI hope that it shall be revived.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also heard just now that the ASEAN Ministers\r\n\r\noften  hold  retreats.  I think the more meetings would  only\r\n\r\naugur for the better.  If too many meets are not practical, I\r\n\r\nwould  certainly  suggest  that the  meeting  of  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament between the two countries be revived.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the subject of our\r\n\r\nrelations  with  Malaysia is often discussed and  debated  in\r\n\r\nthis  Parliament.   In the short time as  a  Member  of  this\r\n\r\nHouse,  I have witnessed the many high points and low  points\r\n\r\nin  our relations with Malaysia.  Whatever it is, I recognise\r\n\r\nthat the destinies of the two countries are intertwined.   We\r\n\r\nhave  close physical proximity with each other and we have  a\r\n\r\ncommon  cultural  heritage.  The reality is  that  we  cannot\r\n\r\nchoose to walk away but to learn to live with one another.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that our relationship with Malaysia in recent\r\n\r\nmonths has once again been on the upswing.  This is evidenced\r\n\r\nby  the exchanges of visits by Ministers on both sides of the\r\n\r\nCauseway.  Like my colleagues before me, Sir, I would like to\r\n\r\nask  the  Minister  to give us an update on the  relationship\r\n\r\nwith  Malaysia, and if we are in any way closer to  resolving\r\n\r\nthe outstanding bilateral issues between us.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Since my colleagues have already asked\r\n\r\nmany of the issues that I want to raise, I would just like to\r\n\r\nfocus  on  the importance of good relations between Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaysia and how we should not allow the bilateral issues\r\n\r\nto  affect our common good and common interest.  When  Deputy\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister,  Abdullah  Badawi,  came  to  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nrequested that the deadline of the relocation of the  CIQ  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  the  POA on redevelopment of land used  by  KTM  be\r\n\r\nextended, we agreed.  But I did not recall that we have set a\r\n\r\nnew  deadline  for the resolution of the issues.   I  do  not\r\n\r\nthink we can negotiate all these issues forever.  Is there  a\r\n\r\ntimeframe that we are working on?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nthere  are  two  dimensions of Singapore-Malaysia  relations.\r\n\r\nOne  is  at the official level between governments  which,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is very close and strong.  But I would like to  touch\r\n\r\non  the  other  dimension which is a personal  level  between\r\n\r\npeople to people which, I think, is somewhat more complex and\r\n\r\nproblematic.  And this is because of the perception gap  that\r\n\r\nexists between what we think Malaysians think of us which can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe very vastly different from what Malaysians really think of\r\n\r\nus.   This  applies to some other countries in the region  as\r\n\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely because of that, relations with Malaysia\r\n\r\ncan  be quite unpredictable because, more often than not,  it\r\n\r\ndepends  on  the domestic political climate and  environment.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  the  forging  of people  to  people  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two  countries must  be  adopted  as  the  most\r\n\r\nsustainable  strategy for us.  Here,  we  have  a  number  of\r\n\r\nproblems.  One is how do we progress in our relationship, one\r\n\r\nfrom a state where we share many common things together,  our\r\n\r\nhistorical  heritage, our culture, our way of  life,  to  one\r\n\r\nwhere  increasingly these common factors will diminish as  we\r\n\r\nbecome very different people and evolve our own way of  life,\r\n\r\nsometimes conflicting but in competition with our neighbours.\r\n\r\nThen can our relations with Malaysia, and maybe the region in\r\n\r\ngeneral,   be   strengthened   precisely   because   of   our\r\n\r\ndifferences?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the erosion of these common factors indicate, like\r\n\r\nmany   have   interpreted,   as  a   deterioration   of   our\r\n\r\nrelationship?  Many would like to view Singaporeans as  being\r\n\r\nmore  Western  and  Asian, being legalistic,  not  warm,  too\r\n\r\nsensitive  and  too  serious.   But  the  answer   is   that,\r\n\r\nprecisely,  we have no other choice because we  are  what  we\r\n\r\nare.   But  we have to do more so that Singapore, our  values\r\n\r\nand   our  way  of  life  become  better  understood  by  our\r\n\r\nneighbours.   And  this should be done at  all  levels.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  we need to enhance efforts through the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nForeign Affairs, and through its diplomatic missions, who can\r\n\r\nplay  a  key role to really reflect our way of life  and  our\r\n\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, we also need to do more to learn and understand\r\n\r\nabout  our  neighbours, learn about their culture, appreciate\r\n\r\ntheir way of life, their customs and tradition.  More of  our\r\n\r\npeople should learn and speak the language of our neighbours.\r\n\r\nFor example, some simple suggestions.  We can issue guides to\r\n\r\nour citizens about simple dos and don'ts when they travel  to\r\n\r\nthe  region  which  could create a lot of goodwill  and  good\r\n\r\nimage for our people\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  they  travel  abroad  because people  do  complain  about\r\n\r\nSingaporeans when we travel abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I want to give a simple experience I had. It did\r\n\r\nnot  happen in Malaysia, but, recently, in Chiang Mai.  I was\r\n\r\nthere.   I  was at a night market and I observed a  Singapore\r\n\r\nfamily  trying  to bargain with the handicraft stall  vendor.\r\n\r\nAnd  unaware  to the Singaporean, he was making  bad  remarks\r\n\r\nabout  the  poor quality of the product that he  intended  to\r\n\r\nbuy.  He was about to walk away from the stall thinking that,\r\n\r\nby  doing  so, he would get a much better discount,  but  all\r\n\r\nthis while, not realising the vendor was extremely displeased\r\n\r\nwith  his  behaviour.   I do not think that  the  Singaporean\r\n\r\ncouple  really understood what it meant.  And I  wonder  what\r\n\r\nthe  vendor  thinks of Singaporeans because these scenes  are\r\n\r\nplayed day in, day out at Chiang Mai night market.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my wish really is that the Foreign Ministry should\r\n\r\nmake  the  forging  of good relations, understanding  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbours,  the  personal responsibility  of  every  citizen\r\n\r\nbecause we have an important role to project our way of  life\r\n\r\nand values to the people in the region.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take the tea break now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and\r\n\r\ntook the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, I wish to thank the Members\r\n\r\nwho spoke on our relations with Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that at the last Committee of Supply debate one\r\n\r\nyear  ago, I then described our bilateral relations as  being\r\n\r\nin  a \"holding pattern\".  Since then, Members would know that\r\n\r\nthere   have  been  several  developments  in  our  bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations with Malaysia.  I would say that, on the whole, the\r\n\r\natmospherics of bilateral relations have improved  since  the\r\n\r\nSenior Minister's visit to Kuala Lumpur in August last  year.\r\n\r\nMalaysian  Foreign Minister, Datuk Syed Hamid, had  described\r\n\r\nthe  visit  as  an  opportunity for strengthening  relations.\r\n\r\nThis  improved  atmosphere,  in  turn,  paved  the  way   for\r\n\r\nincreased    bilateral   contacts   between    leaders    and\r\n\r\nparliamentarians on both sides.  Yes, there was a hiccup over\r\n\r\nMalaysian  reactions to Prime Minister Goh's  speech  on  the\r\n\r\nposition  of Malays in Singapore, but it did not  change  the\r\n\r\noverall tone of the improving relationship.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent visit by Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister,\r\n\r\nDatuk  Abdullah  Badawi, to Singapore in February,  at  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh's  invitation,  also  helped  to  improve   the\r\n\r\nrelationship.    Deputy  Prime  Minister  Abdullah   Badawi's\r\n\r\ndelegation  comprised  several Cabinet  Ministers  and  Chief\r\n\r\nMinisters.   In fact, he and his delegation met many  of  our\r\n\r\nleaders,  including  the  Prime  Minister,  Senior  Minister,\r\n\r\nDeputy  Prime  Minister  BG  Lee Hsien  Loong,  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Dr Tony Tan, and several of our younger leaders  and\r\n\r\nparliamentarians.  The visit succeeded in throwing up several\r\n\r\nideas  for  bilateral cooperation.  For example,  both  sides\r\n\r\nagreed  on  the  need  to develop contact  points  that  will\r\n\r\ninvolve  Malaysians and Singaporeans of various  groups,  eg,\r\n\r\nyouth  groups, student groups, parliamentarians, as  well  as\r\n\r\nbusiness  people, so as to bring Singaporeans and  Malaysians\r\n\r\ntogether  on  an informal basis for greater interactions.   I\r\n\r\nwill  come  back to this later when responding to Mr  Chiam's\r\n\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and Prime Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  also  discussed  the  package of  outstanding  bilateral\r\n\r\nissues.   Members would have read that Malaysia had requested\r\n\r\nto move its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrailway  station from Tanjong Pagar to Kranji.  We  have,  in\r\n\r\nprinciple, agreed to the request, and the details would  have\r\n\r\nto  be sorted out.  In connection with this, we have also, in\r\n\r\nprinciple,  agreed to the construction of  a  tunnel  between\r\n\r\nJohor and Kranji.  Both sides stressed the need to settle the\r\n\r\nissues  in the package as soon as possible, so that we  could\r\n\r\nput them behind us and move relations further forward.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this question of package, Dr Ong Chit Chung and\r\n\r\nseveral  other MPs asked what is the progress and  whether  I\r\n\r\nsaw any prospect of any agreement being reached.  Dr Ong Chit\r\n\r\nChung  recalled  that  the Prime Minister  said  in  a  press\r\n\r\ninterview that Singapore had given our proposals to  Malaysia\r\n\r\nand he had informal feedback that Malaysia was responding  to\r\n\r\nthe  proposals.   I  wish to say, Sir, that  we  have  indeed\r\n\r\nreceived  a  reply  from Dr Mahathir to the Senior  Minister.\r\n\r\nThis  reply, dated 21st February, was received by my Ministry\r\n\r\non  7th  March.  As we received it only a week  ago,  we  are\r\n\r\nstill  studying it.  Our preliminary study shows  that  there\r\n\r\nare variations on some points between Dr Mahathir's reply and\r\n\r\nSenior  Minister's understanding with Dr Mahathir during  his\r\n\r\nvisit to Kuala Lumpur on 15th August last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first blush, the differences do not appear that\r\n\r\ngreat.   However,  on  water, we have to study  the  proposed\r\n\r\nprice  at which we purchase water from Malaysia under  a  new\r\n\r\nagreement  that  will cover the period 2011  and  2061,  and,\r\n\r\nnext,  for the period after 2061, when the Johor River  Water\r\n\r\nAgreement ends.  Another matter is the mix of treated and raw\r\n\r\nwater,  although the volume or quantum will remain the  same,\r\n\r\nas at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters that need to be resolved and put into\r\n\r\na  form  of  words in an agreement before we can finally  put\r\n\r\noutstanding matters behind us.  Sir, I would say  that  after\r\n\r\nall  these  years  since  1997, there  is  now  some  forward\r\n\r\nmovement  on  the  bilateral package that  can  hopefully  be\r\n\r\nfinalised in the coming\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmonths through the same give-and-take on both sides that have\r\n\r\ngot us closer to a settlement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me stress that apart from the\r\n\r\nsupply of water, there are also other outstanding items  that\r\n\r\nneed   to  be  settled  at  the  same  time,  such   as   the\r\n\r\nreinstatement of airspace arrangements for RSAF flights,  the\r\n\r\nlocation  of Malaysian CIQ, the development of MRA lands  and\r\n\r\nCPF  monies  of  Malaysians.  These have to be  agreed  as  a\r\n\r\npackage.   Both sides should, therefore, strive  to  conclude\r\n\r\nthe deal as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked whether any deadline has been set\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the POA.  I think it is worthwhile recalling,\r\n\r\nSir,  that  under the 1990 POA, both governments agreed  that\r\n\r\nthe  KTMB  railway station would be vacated  and  moved  from\r\n\r\nTanjong Pagar to Bukit Timah in the first instance, and  then\r\n\r\nto  Woodlands within five years when the MRT station  reaches\r\n\r\nWoodlands New Town, which it did on 10th February  1996.   In\r\n\r\nJune  1997,  the Prime Minister informed this  House  of  his\r\n\r\nproposal for a framework of cooperation between Singapore and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  to  get  around the impasse over  the  POA.   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh said he was prepared to vary the terms  of  the\r\n\r\nPOA  within a framework of wider cooperation between the  two\r\n\r\ncountries,   in  other  words,  on-going  bilateral   package\r\n\r\nnegotiations.   So,  in  answer  to  Mr  Ravindran,  this  is\r\n\r\nprecisely what is happening.  We are discussing the water and\r\n\r\nother issues in connection with the POA.  When the Malaysians\r\n\r\nmove  to  Kranji, of course it will be a variation, but  this\r\n\r\nmust  be  done  in  the context of the  other  issues  to  be\r\n\r\nresolved.  In other words, it is a total package.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister informed Deputy Prime Minister\r\n\r\nAbdullah Badawi that Singapore agrees to the request to  move\r\n\r\nthe  station  to Kranji.  He was prepared to extend  the  POA\r\n\r\ndeadline so as to allow more time to sort out details.   But,\r\n\r\nof  course,  there has to be a finality to the process.   And\r\n\r\nsince  the  Malaysians  said they need  more  time,  we  have\r\n\r\nagreed.  Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhimself said, and I quote, \"Both sides will work on an urgent\r\n\r\nbasis  and  will  try  as  hard as possible  to  come  to  an\r\n\r\nagreement.\"   And  I  have  just  referred  to   the   latest\r\n\r\ndevelopment, Dr Mahathir's letter to Senior Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi, in that regard, asked whether we have not\r\n\r\ngiven a new deadline, it cannot go on forever, and so on.   I\r\n\r\nwould  respond by saying that both sides are keen to  resolve\r\n\r\nthe  package of bilateral issues as soon as possible so  that\r\n\r\nwe  can  put  these issues behind us.  Although there  is  no\r\n\r\nspecific  timeframe which we have set, I wish to assure  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that there is a sense of urgency on both sides.   Both\r\n\r\nsides want to resolve these issues as soon as possible.  This\r\n\r\nis  a  step  forward.  I would say, therefore,  let  us  take\r\n\r\nthings  one step at a time, and Members, I am sure, know  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government's firm position on the legal nature  of\r\n\r\nthe  obligations under the POA.  We have made that  clear  in\r\n\r\nthis House as well as to the Malaysians.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the underground tunnel\r\n\r\nproposal.   As  I mentioned just now, we have, in  principle,\r\n\r\nagreed  to  the idea of the tunnel proposal.  But, naturally,\r\n\r\nthere  are many technical details to be ironed out, which  we\r\n\r\nare  awaiting and, therefore, I am not able to  go  into  the\r\n\r\ndetails at this stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral relations generally, Mr Zulkifli and Mr\r\n\r\nChiam  made  certain suggestions.  Mr Zulkifli  gave  certain\r\n\r\nproposals  and  ideas,  which I take  as  increasing  greater\r\n\r\nunderstanding  between the peoples of neighbouring  countries\r\n\r\nas well as other countries in the region.  Some of his ideas,\r\n\r\nI  am sure, can be taken up by the various agencies, such  as\r\n\r\nhis  idea  of  do's  and  don'ts.  We  can  ask  the  Tourist\r\n\r\nPromotion  Board to look into it.  I would say  offhand  that\r\n\r\nhis  ideas  are well intentioned and we will have a  look  at\r\n\r\nthem.   But  the  main point I want to make is  that  Members\r\n\r\nought  not  view  the development of good  relations  between\r\n\r\nSingapore and other countries as the sole preserve or duty of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs or  any  other  particular\r\n\r\nMinistry, or of the Government.  I have always held\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  view  that the betterment of relations and the promotion\r\n\r\nof  goodwill  between  Singapore and other  countries  partly\r\n\r\ndepends  on government-to-government interactions,  but  very\r\n\r\nmuch   also   depends  on  people-to-people   relations   and\r\n\r\ninteractions, and it is in that context that  I  move  on  to\r\n\r\nwhat Mr Chiam said.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has made some equally well-intentioned\r\n\r\nsuggestions.   I welcome his suggestions.  Like Mr  Zulkifli,\r\n\r\nhe   has   emphasised  people-to-people  contacts.    It   is\r\n\r\nconsistent with what I have said.  I also agree with him that\r\n\r\nif  there  are  to be visits between Malaysia, Singapore  and\r\n\r\nother  countries, it should not be just confined to  the  top\r\n\r\nleaders.  He is absolutely right.  But let me assure him that\r\n\r\nwith  regard  to Malaysia, for instance, these contacts  have\r\n\r\nactually been beyond Government.  For example, apart from the\r\n\r\nBench  and Bar Games, I know that the universities  have  had\r\n\r\nregular  contacts.  In fact, at the last Games  in  Malaysia,\r\n\r\nthe   university  contingent,  I  believe,  was  led  by  our\r\n\r\nPresident  in  his  capacity as Chancellor  of  the  National\r\n\r\nUniversity   of  Singapore.   There  are  also   many   other\r\n\r\ninteractions between our professional and uniformed services,\r\n\r\neg, the Police, the Armed Forces, and the Foreign Ministry to\r\n\r\nForeign Ministry Games.  I believe MINDEF has games with  its\r\n\r\ncounterparts.  The civil services also have their games.  So,\r\n\r\nI agree with him.  This is going on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, we should explore various other ways of\r\n\r\nenhancing  these contacts.  And this is precisely what  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh and Deputy Prime Minister Badawi discussed  when\r\n\r\nthey emphasised the idea of developing points of contact.  So\r\n\r\nwe  would  certainly want to go in that  direction.   I  also\r\n\r\nagree  with  him that we should promote further  interactions\r\n\r\nbetween our Members of Parliament and their backbenchers, and\r\n\r\nI  heard  recently  that there were to  be  some  golf  games\r\n\r\nbetween our backbenchers and their MPs, and we would strongly\r\n\r\nencourage that.  I know we have a backbenchers' club and  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Parliamentary Society. Whether through this vehicle\r\n\r\nor  even  informally outside this channel, I would  encourage\r\n\r\nMembers to meet.  So whether\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nit is between the civil services, professional organisations,\r\n\r\nnon-governmental   organisations,   the   totality   of    it\r\n\r\nsupplements  the  formal  government-to-government  bilateral\r\n\r\ncontacts.   In  fact,  the informal contacts  and  people-to-people   relationship  sometimes  may  be  equally  important\r\n\r\nbecause  they are not saddled with bureaucracy and  forms  of\r\n\r\nprotocol,  they  can  speak more frankly  and  more  informal\r\n\r\ncontacts.  I would therefore welcome the suggestions  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit in which it was given, not only for Malaysia, but also\r\n\r\nother countries in the region.\r\n\r\n<br>3.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for his reply on Malaysia-Singapore relations and am\r\n\r\nglad that progress is being made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we move on to Indonesia. Indonesia is our big\r\n\r\nneighbour  to the south.  Standard and Poor's, the  financial\r\n\r\nagency, citing political unrest, has cut the long-term rating\r\n\r\nfor  Indonesia  to negative.  This downgrading  reflects  the\r\n\r\nincreasingly uncertain socio-political situation in Indonesia\r\n\r\nand has negative implications on the economic performance  of\r\n\r\nthe country.  The rupiah has also fallen to 10,000 to the  US\r\n\r\ndollar, hitting a 29-month low.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are separatist movements in Aceh and Irian Jaya,\r\n\r\nand  in  Kalimantan,  the Dayaks have massacred  hundreds  of\r\n\r\nMadurese.  Law and order is breaking down in some parts,  and\r\n\r\nthere could be problems of refugees fleeing and seeking  safe\r\n\r\nhavens elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such developments in Indonesia, Singapore has to be\r\n\r\nwatchful  and  has  to keep track of all  these  events.  The\r\n\r\ngolden  days of Singapore-Indonesia relations, in retrospect,\r\n\r\nwere  when President Suharto was in power in Indonesia.  Then\r\n\r\nwe had President Habibie, who called us the \"little red dot\".\r\n\r\nWe   thought  we  would  fare  much  better  with   President\r\n\r\nAbdurrahman  Wahid, but it was not to be.   There  were  also\r\n\r\ntwists and turns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite this, are there new areas in which the two\r\n\r\ncountries  can  cooperate to our mutual benefit?   Are  there\r\n\r\npotential  problems we are likely to encounter in the  coming\r\n\r\nyears?   We  wish  Indonesia every success  in  its  economic\r\n\r\nrestructuring, and hope that Singapore and Indonesia can work\r\n\r\nclosely together to our mutual benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, Indonesia continues to be compounded\r\n\r\nby  a myriad of economic, social and political problems.  The\r\n\r\nimplementation  of  regional autonomy  had  meant  that  many\r\n\r\ndecisions would be made locally at the regional level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Indonesia is precarious and volatile.\r\n\r\nI  would like to ask the Minister, in the light of all  these\r\n\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What is the state of our relations with Indonesia;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What is the usage of all the financial assistance\r\n\r\npackages that we have so far offered to Indonesia; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the impact of regional autonomy within\r\n\r\nIndonesia  and  how Singapore intends to position  itself  to\r\n\r\ndeal with many of the regional governments near us, like Riau\r\n\r\nprovince, South Sumatra province and Jambi province?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, our relations with Indonesia have\r\n\r\ngone through several phases from the time of our independence\r\n\r\nup  to  now.  On the whole, our past relations with Indonesia\r\n\r\nwere  close, warm and friendly.  In marked contrast, we  have\r\n\r\nseen,  in  the last three years, two Presidents of  Indonesia\r\n\r\npersonally  attacking Singapore and questioning our  attitude\r\n\r\nand perceived unhelpfulness towards Indonesia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although relations seem to have been smoothened out with\r\n\r\nthe  recent launching of the multi-million dollar gas project\r\n\r\nbetween  the  two countries, not surprisingly,  the  November\r\n\r\nepisode has left a bad taste.  On the whole, I would say that\r\n\r\nI  agree  with the Minister and support the position  of  the\r\n\r\nMinister in stressing that we should take a long-term view in\r\n\r\nour relations with Indonesia.  Can the Minister update us  on\r\n\r\nthe current state of relations\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  Indonesia  and the developments there?   An  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nthat  is  strife-full, as it is now,  is  not  good  for  the\r\n\r\nregion, and not good for us.  An Indonesia that is broken  up\r\n\r\nmust be worse.      From interactions with the residents  and\r\n\r\nfellow  Singaporeans, I get the sense that Singaporeans  want\r\n\r\nto  know  about  the  prospect of  our  largest  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountry remaining united. What is the view of the Minister in\r\n\r\nthis matter?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, in my reference to the strategic\r\n\r\nsituation,  I  said  that Indonesia is still  grappling  with\r\n\r\nserious political, economic and social challenges.  New power\r\n\r\ncentres have emerged in Indonesia's political landscape.  The\r\n\r\nIndonesian  Parliament  (DPR) has assumed  a  more  assertive\r\n\r\ncheck  and  balance  role  on the  government.   Furthermore,\r\n\r\nproblems  of  security and stability have not  abated.   Last\r\n\r\nChristmas  eve,  there were bomb blasts in  major  cities  in\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  Members must have read of all the reports of  the\r\n\r\nserious problems of killings in Kalimantan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, these political and security developments, together\r\n\r\nwith the Indonesian government's differences with the IMF, do\r\n\r\naffect  economic recovery and investor confidence.   Feedback\r\n\r\nfrom investors is that they will continue to adopt a wait-and-see  attitude  until they are comfortable with the  political\r\n\r\nand   security   situation  in  Indonesia.   The   Indonesian\r\n\r\ngovernment  has  to deal also with the evolving  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween  Jakarta  and  the provinces.  One  challenge  is  to\r\n\r\nmanage  the  implementation of the  regional  autonomy  laws,\r\n\r\nsomething  that Mr Ravindran alluded to.  This is  a  complex\r\n\r\nexercise and would have implications on the shape and  future\r\n\r\nof government structure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members asked about the state of our bilateral\r\n\r\nrelations.   I  think  Members know that our  relations  with\r\n\r\nIndonesia have seen a rough patch recently.  They would  have\r\n\r\nnoted  the allegations that President Abdurrahman Wahid  made\r\n\r\nagainst  Singapore  last November and, as  I  have  said,  we\r\n\r\nreacted by putting up factual statements in a measured manner\r\n\r\nto  point out the inaccuracies of these allegations.  We  set\r\n\r\ntheir record straight.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On bilateral relations, our position is clear. We have\r\n\r\nalways valued our relations with Indonesia.  The fundamentals\r\n\r\nof  that  relationship, built up over 30 years of  friendship\r\n\r\nand  close cooperation, are strong.  However, there  will  be\r\n\r\nups  and  downs along the way.  We have to take  a  long-term\r\n\r\nview  of  relations between Singapore and  Indonesia  and  we\r\n\r\nshould therefore be prepared to ride out any difficulties  as\r\n\r\nthey  come along in this bilateral relationship.  At the same\r\n\r\ntime,  we  must  keep  ourselves open  to  opportunities  for\r\n\r\ncooperation  with Indonesia. Therefore, our  approach  is  to\r\n\r\nwork  for mutually beneficial ties in the long-term,  on  the\r\n\r\nbasis that we are sovereign equals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is strategically important, not only to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but also to the region and ASEAN,  a  point  that\r\n\r\nseveral Members have made this afternoon.  Naturally, we hope\r\n\r\nthat  the  situation in Indonesia will improve quickly.   But\r\n\r\nplease  remember  that  Singapore is a  small  country,  with\r\n\r\nlimited  resources.   On  our own, we cannot  help  Indonesia\r\n\r\novercome its economic problems. What we can do is to  play  a\r\n\r\ncatalytic   role.   Our  economic  assistance  to  Indonesia,\r\n\r\nsomething that Mr Ravindran mentioned, has to be seen in this\r\n\r\nframework.  We  hope  that it might encourage  other  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors to follow Singapore's lead and invest there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should mention the recently concluded Asamera gas\r\n\r\ndeal, worth US$8 billion over 22 years.  It is one example of\r\n\r\nour  long-term commitment to cooperating with Indonesia.  The\r\n\r\nfact  that  President Wahid came personally to  Singapore  to\r\n\r\nwitness  the  First  Gas ceremony - and that  was  after  his\r\n\r\noutburst  -  is  a  recognition of such  mutually  beneficial\r\n\r\nprojects of cooperation.  Only last month, we signed  another\r\n\r\nagreement  to  purchase gas from Sumatra worth  US$7  billion\r\n\r\nover 20 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other developments include Senior Minister's recent\r\n\r\nvisit  to  Jakarta  to attend a meeting of President  Wahid's\r\n\r\nInternational  Advisory Panel.  He did so on the  basis  that\r\n\r\nSingapore-Indonesia relations must be kept  steady,  whatever\r\n\r\ntemporary upsets there may be.  Minister George Yeo\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  visited South Sumatra and Riau provinces last month  to\r\n\r\nexplore economic opportunities there.  That again is relevant\r\n\r\nto  what  Mr  Ravindran  talked  about  in  cooperating  with\r\n\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for what Mr Ravindran specifically asked for about\r\n\r\nregional  autonomy,  let me say that  regional  autonomy  was\r\n\r\nintroduced in Indonesia by law only on 1st January 2001.  The\r\n\r\nrules  and  laws governing regional autonomy  are  still  not\r\n\r\nclear.  The central government and the provincial authorities\r\n\r\nare  in  the process, I believe, of fine-tuning this process,\r\n\r\nso as to ensure an effective and efficient system of regional\r\n\r\nautonomy.  I think it will take some time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From our perspective, I would say that the conduct of\r\n\r\ndiplomatic  relations, as in the case of other countries,  is\r\n\r\nwith  the central government in Jakarta.  Any steps  that  we\r\n\r\ntake  to  establish links with the provinces will  be  within\r\n\r\nthis broader framework of bilateral relations with Indonesia.\r\n\r\nOf  course,  with  regional  autonomy,  we  can  expect  more\r\n\r\nSingapore  businessmen to explore business  opportunities  in\r\n\r\nthe   region   and  to  deal  directly  with  the  provincial\r\n\r\nauthorities.   Riau  will  be especially  attractive  to  our\r\n\r\nbusinessmen  because of the region's proximity  to  Singapore\r\n\r\nand  the  already extensive links which many of  our  private\r\n\r\nsector has in that area.  In anticipation of the increase  in\r\n\r\nSingapore's interests in the Riaus, we have recently  decided\r\n\r\nto  open  a  Consulate and Trade Office  in  Pekanbaru.   Our\r\n\r\nConsulate in Pekanbaru will also provide consular services to\r\n\r\na growing number of Singaporeans visiting the Riau provinces.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, despite an unfortunate blemish in\r\n\r\nour  records that took place nearly 60 years ago,  Singapore-Japan  ties  have  always  been  characterised  by  warm  and\r\n\r\nfriendly  exchanges,  both  at the  level  of  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership  and  on  a  people-to-people  basis.   The   good\r\n\r\nrelationship between the two countries is perhaps  helped  by\r\n\r\nthe  common elements that exist between them.  To begin with,\r\n\r\nboth countries lack\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnatural   resources  and  are,  therefore,   almost   totally\r\n\r\ndependent  on  trade  with  the outside  world  to  meet  its\r\n\r\nrequirements.  In this regard, freedom of navigation  through\r\n\r\nthe  Malacca  Straits is of vital strategic  importance,  not\r\n\r\nonly  for  us, but for Japan as well.  The two countries  are\r\n\r\nalso  caught  up  by  the  potentially  explosive  nature  of\r\n\r\npolitics  in  their  respective  regions.   In  the  case  of\r\n\r\nNortheast  Asia,  Japan is concerned with  the  way  the  two\r\n\r\nKoreas  settle their long-standing differences and is  hoping\r\n\r\nthat  war  would  not  be  the solution  of  choice  for  the\r\n\r\nunification of the two countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in Singapore, small as it may be for\r\n\r\nus,  we  are an oasis in the region, troubled by the internal\r\n\r\nstrife  and  differences.  More importantly, Singapore  could\r\n\r\npotentially be caught up with the struggle for control in the\r\n\r\nSpratly  Islands.   In  Southeast Asia, Japan  has  important\r\n\r\nreasons  for  staying engaged. First, Japanese investment  in\r\n\r\nSoutheast  Asia has been rather substantial.   In  Singapore,\r\n\r\nthe  Japanese  investment  alone for  year  1999  was  $1.179\r\n\r\nbillion, as opposed to $708.2 million in 1990. Secondly,  the\r\n\r\nMalacca  Straits is of strategic importance to Japan,  as  it\r\n\r\nprovides a means by which trade between the East and West  is\r\n\r\nfacilitated.  I believe, Sir, that the bulk of  Japanese  oil\r\n\r\nimports passes through the Straits of Malacca.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, in Japan's interest that Southeast\r\n\r\nAsia remains stable in the long run. Singapore and Japan  can\r\n\r\nbe effective partners in promoting peace and stability in the\r\n\r\nregion.  The on-going discussions between Japan and Singapore\r\n\r\nin  respect of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is something that\r\n\r\nmany  watchers are interested in.  At the core of the FTA  is\r\n\r\nthe  underlying  belief  that  free  trade  between  the  two\r\n\r\ncountries  would  serve their respective  economic  interest.\r\n\r\nThis can be a model for the other countries in ASEAN as well,\r\n\r\ncontrary to what others may think that the FTA with Japan  is\r\n\r\na back-door entry to AFTA.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Singapore-Japan FTA, if adopted by the other\r\n\r\ncountries in the region, may serve to provide a new\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nplatform  for economic growth and, in the long run, form  the\r\n\r\nbasis  of stability in the region.  I would, therefore,  like\r\n\r\nto  ask  the  Minister to give us an update on  the  on-going\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with Japan on the FTA and whether or  not  there\r\n\r\nare obstacles, if any, that will affect negotiations, and  if\r\n\r\nthe FTA can be signed by the end of the year.\r\n\r\n<br>3.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I rise to\r\n\r\nspeak on relations with Australia and New Zealand.  If I may,\r\n\r\nI would like to place in the context of much of the foregoing\r\n\r\nconversation.   Obviously, our focus  is  on  ASEAN  and  our\r\n\r\nimmediate  neighbours.   And  as  we  look  across  the  Asia\r\n\r\nPacific,  we look more at America and to North East  Asia  in\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN+3.  But I believe that relations with Australia and\r\n\r\nNew Zealand do require emphasis.  This is not to say that  we\r\n\r\nhave  bad  ties.  In fact, we have good ties with  these  two\r\n\r\ncountries.   But I would encourage the Ministry not  to  over\r\n\r\nfocus on our problems and forget our friends.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a multi-Ministerial exchange with Australia, and\r\n\r\nwe  have  already  concluded a bilateral free trade agreement\r\n\r\nwith  New Zealand, and both these countries are part  of  the\r\n\r\nFive  Power  Defence  Arrangements (FPDA).   They  are  ASEAN\r\n\r\ndialogue  partners too.  But, lately, there  have  been  some\r\n\r\nconcerns.  There was an attempt for consideration to link the\r\n\r\nASEAN Free Trade Agreement to the Australia-New Zealand  CER.\r\n\r\nHowever,  this  was  rebuffed  by  some  ASEAN  members,  not\r\n\r\nSingapore,  but we were unable to change the  minds  of  some\r\n\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we on our part must do what we can to\r\n\r\nstrengthen and deepen our ties with these two countries.   My\r\n\r\nfirst suggestion is that we should build on the foundation of\r\n\r\ngood inter-governmental ties, to include ties outside of  the\r\n\r\ngovernment,  such  as universities, think  tanks,  youth  and\r\n\r\nsports.   We  should deepen the interaction between  our  two\r\n\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, beyond deepening, we should also widen the\r\n\r\ncircle.  Sir, Singapore\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsometimes takes a lead in inter-regional discussions, such as\r\n\r\nthe East Asia-Latin America Forum, which the Minister will go\r\n\r\nto in March.  On this occasion, we will include Australia and\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand with the so-called East Asian lot.  And I  think\r\n\r\nthis  is  an important step to try and include them  with  as\r\n\r\nmany  people as possible.  Other things can be done too  when\r\n\r\nwe   work  to  integrate  the  new  ASEAN  members.   Perhaps\r\n\r\nSingapore, working as a catalyst, can work with Australia and\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand to give assistance to some of these new members.\r\n\r\nOr  as  DPM  Tony Tan said, in the debate on the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nDefence,  that  if  we  want to contribute  to  peace-keeping\r\n\r\ntraining, we should do so with Australia and New Zealand, and\r\n\r\nother like-minded countries in ASEAN and in North East Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third suggestion relates to the ASEAN+3 process.\r\n\r\nClearly, Sir, this is an important process.  North East  Asia\r\n\r\nare  important partners.  But I think creative efforts should\r\n\r\nbe  made to link this to Australia and New Zealand.  They  do\r\n\r\nnot have to become part of the ASEAN+3 process, but they have\r\n\r\nto  be part of what I would call \"variable geometry\", the way\r\n\r\nof  looking at the whole region into various sub-groups which\r\n\r\ncan overlap at times.  I think this is very important because\r\n\r\nthe  functionality  of  our economics and  security  and  our\r\n\r\ninterdependence is linked to Australia and New Zealand.   And\r\n\r\nI  also  believe  that  the inclusion of  Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand  in  some of these different groupings  would  better\r\n\r\nrecognise them as part of the region, and rescue and save  us\r\n\r\nfrom any hint that ASEAN+3 is basically a form of racism,  in\r\n\r\nthat  we  are all non-white somehow.  And I think  that  this\r\n\r\nidea  of variable geometry is an important one. The Minister,\r\n\r\nin  his  earlier remarks, referred to the two track approach.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we are talking about the same thing. In this, we look\r\n\r\nat  ASEAN, ASEAN+3, APEC, more broadly, but then we come back\r\n\r\nto a network of other relationships.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close these three suggestions just on a\r\n\r\nvery  simple point, Sir.  This is that as we are pursuing  so\r\n\r\nmany different tracks or this variable geometry, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmust  wonder  whether  the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  has\r\n\r\nsufficient resources.  This keeps people very busy.  From the\r\n\r\nbudget, I see that the Ministry is relatively small.   And  I\r\n\r\nwant the Minister to consider whether more resources will  be\r\n\r\nneeded.  I think many Singaporeans, at the ordinary level, do\r\n\r\nnot  fully  appreciate the importance of the  work  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Foreign Affairs does.  I think the  crisis  has\r\n\r\nshown  us however that relations and security and good comity\r\n\r\nbetween nations are important.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock):</b> Sir, I agree with Mr Sin Boon Ann that Japan is a very\r\n\r\nimportant country to the region.  Indeed, Japan has played  a\r\n\r\ncrucial  role in industrialising the region in the  past  30-plus  years.   It  is  a  major trading  partner  and   major\r\n\r\ninvestor  in the region, bringing with it capital, technology\r\n\r\nand   employment.   Although  it  is  faced   with   economic\r\n\r\ndifficulties in recent years, Japan is likely to  recover  in\r\n\r\nthe  longer  term.  Japan will continue to play a significant\r\n\r\nrole  in the development of regional cooperation, as  it  has\r\n\r\ndone in the past.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Japan announced a US$15 billion package to\r\n\r\nhelp narrow the global digital divide, focusing on Asia.   At\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN+3 informal summit in Singapore, the \"Mori e-Action\"\r\n\r\nwas  launched  to  bridge the developmental gap  between  the\r\n\r\nnewer  and  older  ASEAN  members.   Singapore  is  currently\r\n\r\nworking closely with Japan to implement these projects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our relations with Japan are excellent. Japan is\r\n\r\nimportant to us, both economically and strategically.   Japan\r\n\r\nhas  been  Singapore's third largest trading partner  in  the\r\n\r\npast  three  years.  Our trade volume increased  from  S$40.5\r\n\r\nbillion in 1998 to S$57.9 billion last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has put in much effort to engage Japan in the\r\n\r\nregion.   Bilaterally,  in  the  past  three  years,  several\r\n\r\nbilateral  initiatives were launched  with  Japan  to  create\r\n\r\ninstitutional   links  between  our  two  countries.    These\r\n\r\ninitiatives include the annual MFA-Gaimusho Dialogue;  the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nJapan-Singapore  Partnership Programme 21 for  third  country\r\n\r\ntechnical  cooperation; the Diplomat Exchange Programme;  the\r\n\r\nJapan-Singapore  Symposium; the SIF's Raffles  Programme  for\r\n\r\nvisits  by  top  Japanese  bureaucrats;  the  Japan-Singapore\r\n\r\nBusiness    Council;   the   Japan-Singapore    Parliamentary\r\n\r\nFriendship  League;  and  the Japan-Singapore  Action  Agenda\r\n\r\nCommittee.   The wide range of linkages together with  trade,\r\n\r\ninvestment  and  tourism  helps to  promote  people-to-people\r\n\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also work closely with Japan in regional and\r\n\r\ninternational fora, such as the ARF, APEC and the UN.   As  a\r\n\r\nmajor trading partner and investor in the region, Japan has a\r\n\r\nlarge stake in the well-being of the region.  In the last few\r\n\r\nyears,  we  have seen the efforts Japan put in  to  help  the\r\n\r\nregion  recover from the Asian financial crisis.   Japan  was\r\n\r\nthe  main  contributor  to  rescue packages  to  the  region,\r\n\r\nthrough the US$30 billion Miyazawa Plan.  Japan has consulted\r\n\r\nclosely with regional countries as events unfolded, so as  to\r\n\r\nassess developments and coordinate policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the specific point of freedom of navigation in the\r\n\r\nStraits  of Malacca, our position is clear on this particular\r\n\r\nissue.   The  route  through  the  Straits  of  Malacca   and\r\n\r\nSingapore is the shortest sea lane between East and West.  It\r\n\r\nis also the most cost efficient and preferred sea lane.  Most\r\n\r\nof  East Asia's oil imports from the Middle East pass through\r\n\r\nthese  Straits.  It is therefore in the interest of not  only\r\n\r\nSingapore  and Japan but also the global community to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  freedom of passage through the Straits of  Malacca  and\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  preserved.  Singapore will  continue  to  work\r\n\r\nclosely  with Japan and other countries to ensure the freedom\r\n\r\nof navigation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin referred to the free trade agreement negotiation\r\n\r\nwith  Japan.  A major boost in our relations was  when  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh and Prime Minister Mori agreed last October  to\r\n\r\nlaunch  the Japan-Singapore Economic Agreement for a New  Age\r\n\r\nPartnership  (JSEPA)  in  January  2001,  and  conclude   the\r\n\r\nAgreement no later than 31 December 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  have been two preparatory meetings and a formal  round\r\n\r\nof negotiations so far.  Progress has been good.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the JSEPA will help engage Japan and anchor its\r\n\r\ninterest  in  the region in the long run.  This will  benefit\r\n\r\nSingapore  and ASEAN.  At the time when Europe  and  Americas\r\n\r\nare  increasingly moving towards closer economic  integration\r\n\r\nand  market liberalisation within their regions, Asia  should\r\n\r\nnot be left behind as a result.  Asia should push for further\r\n\r\neconomic integration.  The JSEPA is a step in the direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement, once concluded, will further strengthen\r\n\r\nour   economic  linkages  and  promote  bilateral  trade  and\r\n\r\nbusiness.   The inclusion of new-age elements like ICT  would\r\n\r\nalso  open  new  platforms for economic activities.   On  the\r\n\r\nwhole,  the  JSEPA will provide ample opportunities  for  our\r\n\r\npeoples  at  all levels to interact with and know each  other\r\n\r\nbetter.   This will contribute to the widening and  deepening\r\n\r\nof our bilateral relations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to Mr Simon Tay's points on relations\r\n\r\nwith  Australia and New Zealand.  As he said,  Singapore  has\r\n\r\nexcellent relations with both Australia and New Zealand, with\r\n\r\nlong  standing cooperation in diplomacy, defence,  trade  and\r\n\r\neducation  and also in multi-lateral fora such  as  the  ARF,\r\n\r\nAPEC  and the Commonwealth.  We are members of the Five Power\r\n\r\nDefence  Arrangements, and Australia and New Zealand  provide\r\n\r\ntraining   facilities   for  our  SAF.    Regular   bilateral\r\n\r\nleadership exchanges have further reaffirmed our close  ties.\r\n\r\nSeveral  bilateral initiatives were launched in recent  years\r\n\r\nto strengthen these ties at all levels.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the new initiatives, the most important ones are\r\n\r\nperhaps  free trade agreements.  Our decision to  enter  into\r\n\r\nbilateral  FTAs with Australia and New Zealand is taken  with\r\n\r\nthe interest of the region in mind.  We hope that Singapore's\r\n\r\nFTAs with Australia and New Zealand will act as a catalyst to\r\n\r\nthe  AFTA-CER-CEP,  and greater economic integration  between\r\n\r\nthe  two  regions.  This will best serve our overall interest\r\n\r\nand an enlarged integrated\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregion   will   greatly  increase  business  and   investment\r\n\r\nopportunities  in  the  region, and  also  boost   investors'\r\n\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Australia-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. Prime\r\n\r\nMinister Goh and Prime Minister John Howard jointly agreed to\r\n\r\nlaunch  negotiations  for  the  Australia-Singapore  FTA   in\r\n\r\nNovember  2000  on  the  site of  the  Brunei  APEC  Economic\r\n\r\nLeaders'  Meeting.   Two way bilateral  trade  in  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices  was more than A$13 billion last year.  The proposed\r\n\r\nFTA  serves  to  further build on the  strong  and  expanding\r\n\r\neconomic    partnership   between    the    two    economies.\r\n\r\nStrategically, the Australia-Singapore FTA acts as a catalyst\r\n\r\nto  APEC's integration and the realisation of the Bogor goals\r\n\r\nof  free and open trade and investments across the Pacific in\r\n\r\nthe next decade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the agreement between New Zealand and Singapore\r\n\r\non  closer economic partnership was signed by Prime  Minister\r\n\r\nGoh  and  Prime  Minister Helen Clark in  Singapore  on  14th\r\n\r\nNovember last year, after about a year of negotiations.   The\r\n\r\nagreement came into effect on 1st January 2001.  The ANZ SCEP\r\n\r\nis  a  comprehensive agreement covering trade  in  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices,   investment  and  Government  procurement,   among\r\n\r\nothers.   The agreement provides certainty and predictability\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore businesses and investors.  The agreement  will\r\n\r\nopen  up considerable opportunity for our business community.\r\n\r\nTrade Ministers from both sides will meet every two years  to\r\n\r\nreview and expand on the commitments under the agreement.   A\r\n\r\ngeneral review of the agreement will be conducted in 2005.\r\n\r\n<br>4.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the two trade agreements, or FTAs, we\r\n\r\nhave  the  Singapore-Australia Joint  Ministerial  Committee.\r\n\r\nThe  Joint  Committee is a rather unique initiative  evolving\r\n\r\nfrom  the  Singapore-Australia New Partnership  announced  in\r\n\r\n1996.   The  Joint Economic Committee which meets  every  two\r\n\r\nyears  is led by the Foreign Ministers and includes two other\r\n\r\nMinisters in charge of trade and defence\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfrom  each side.  Australia will host the third SAJMC meeting\r\n\r\nthis  year.   The  joint meeting, which has met  twice  since\r\n\r\n1996, serves to further strengthen relations and set concrete\r\n\r\ndirection  to  realise the new partnership between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Australia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to some specific suggestions by Mr Simon\r\n\r\nTay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, strengthening ties outside governments. I\r\n\r\nagree  with  him.   In  fact, there are strong  ties  between\r\n\r\nuniversities,  think-tanks  and NGOs  between  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nAustralia, and New Zealand.  Let me add, as far as  Australia\r\n\r\nis  concerned, we have a Young Business Ambassador  Programme\r\n\r\nas  an  example.  With New Zealand, we have a Work Attachment\r\n\r\nProgramme.  In other words, Singapore also has extensive non-government links with both Australia and New Zealand.  People\r\n\r\nto  people linkages are thick and there are several bilateral\r\n\r\nprojects.  I have just named a few examples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, assistance to new ASEAN member countries.\r\n\r\nSingapore  has worked closely with Australia and New  Zealand\r\n\r\nto assist new ASEAN member countries.  Both Australia and New\r\n\r\nZealand  are constructive and active participants in the  ARF\r\n\r\nand  ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conferences.  Australia  and  New\r\n\r\nZealand   have  also  indicated  interest  in  working   with\r\n\r\nSingapore  on projects relating to the initiative  for  ASEAN\r\n\r\nintegration  such  as  on  IT,  so  as  to  help  breach  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental gap between newer and older ASEAN countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I believe that Mr Simon Tay referred to links\r\n\r\nwith  ASEAN+3.  Let me say that we do not preclude  any  such\r\n\r\nflexibility.   Indeed, APEC is an established  forum  linking\r\n\r\nAustralia   and  New  Zealand  with  ASEAN  and  East   Asia.\r\n\r\nAustralia  indeed was instrumental in fostering the  creation\r\n\r\nof  APEC  and  hosted the first APEC Ministerial  Meeting  in\r\n\r\nCanberra  in 1989.  APEC remains the only forum which  brings\r\n\r\ntogether both sides of the Pacific each year, leaders from 21\r\n\r\neconomies from ASEAN, North East Asia,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nNorth  America,  South America, Australia  and  New  Zealand.\r\n\r\nThey  meet together informally to discuss economic and  other\r\n\r\nimportant issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I do believe, in the case of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  that  small  is beautiful.

I am glad that our  hopes  and\r\n\r\ndreams over the last few years have been realised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask what is the agenda of Singapore in\r\n\r\nthe  UN  Security Council.  What are our roles and priorities\r\n\r\nin  the  UN Security Council?  To what extent will Singapore,\r\n\r\nas a representative, be able to reflect the security concerns\r\n\r\nof ASEAN and our region?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we channelled more resources, including manpower,\r\n\r\nto  our UN mission in New York, so that it can function  even\r\n\r\nmore effectively in the Security Council?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has participated in UN peace-keeping missions\r\n\r\nsince  1989.   We  had sent small contingents  to  UNIKOM  in\r\n\r\nKuwait and UNTAC in Cambodia.  We have done well.  The latest\r\n\r\nis the UN-sanctioned INTERFET mission in East Timor, where we\r\n\r\nhave sent medical and logistical support teams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister whether Singapore intends to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  scope and quality of our participation  in  UN\r\n\r\npeace-keeping  missions  in  the future,  when  opportunities\r\n\r\npresent themselves?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, we were voted into the membership\r\n\r\nof  the UN Security Council in October 1999.  Election to the\r\n\r\nmembership of the Council is indeed an honour for us  and  at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, it is a milestone that indicates that we have\r\n\r\nmatured  as  a  member  of the international  community.   As\r\n\r\nCouncil  member,  we  have  additional  responsibilities   to\r\n\r\nshoulder.   I  have  no  doubt  that  we  will  shoulder  and\r\n\r\ndischarge our responsibilities with distinction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been more than a year since we assumed membership\r\n\r\nof  the  Council.   No doubt, many events  have  taken  place\r\n\r\nsince.   I note that in recent times, the UN Security Council\r\n\r\nhas been forced to play\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nan  increasingly active role in managing the trouble spots in\r\n\r\nthe  world.

Actually  we\r\n\r\nhave only been on the Security Council for three months, not,\r\n\r\nas  Mr Sin Boon Ann said, more than a year.  On the very  day\r\n\r\nwe assumed the membership of the Security Council, because of\r\n\r\nthe system of alphabetical rotation, we also became President\r\n\r\nof  the  Council  for  the  month  of  January.

I think that so far, although it\r\n\r\nis  only  three  months that have passed, it  has  been  both\r\n\r\neducational, instructive but also humbling - humbling because\r\n\r\nI  think it reminds us that we are a small country.  The fact\r\n\r\nthat  we are on the Security Council has not changed it,  and\r\n\r\nwe  will still be a small country after we step down from the\r\n\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong Chit Chung asked what is our agenda for this\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council.   Actually,  the  agenda  is  set  by  the\r\n\r\nturbulent world events that will occur during these two years\r\n\r\nwhen  we  are on the Security Council.  This means  that  our\r\n\r\nteam  in New York and our team in headquarters, MFA, have  to\r\n\r\nbe  well  informed, including on many issues which previously\r\n\r\nmight  not have been major items in our radar scope but these\r\n\r\nare  major items for many countries and they come up  in  the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, and positions have to be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on the lessons learned during this short period of\r\n\r\nthree months, I think it is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclear  to  us that the influence of the permanent members  of\r\n\r\nthe Security Council (what they refer to as the P5 countries)\r\n\r\nweighs heavily on nearly every issue of the Security Council.\r\n\r\nThis  is not only due to their big power status or their veto\r\n\r\npower but, in addition, their global reach to the control and\r\n\r\nuse  of  international media and access to information around\r\n\r\nthe  world,  particularly in conflict  situations.   Most  P5\r\n\r\ncountries consult each other quite closely and try to forge a\r\n\r\ncommon  position.  And they are able to do this for a  number\r\n\r\nof  issues,  but  in some issues they have differences.   The\r\n\r\nrecent  air  strike  against Iraq and the  no-fly  zones  are\r\n\r\nexamples  where  Russia  and China  took  a  strong  position\r\n\r\nagainst  the  United  States and United Kingdom,  and  France\r\n\r\nexpressed rather strong reservations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that the P5 exerts a tremendous role in the\r\n\r\nSecurity Council, does this mean that elected members in  the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  who are elected only for two years, like Singapore,\r\n\r\nhave  no role to play?  I do not think so.  An elected member\r\n\r\ncan  bring  to the Council certain perspectives  of  a  small\r\n\r\ncountry  or  a  different perspective of  a  country  from  a\r\n\r\ndifferent region.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give one example, and that is, when we became\r\n\r\nPresident of the Security Council, like all presidencies,  we\r\n\r\nwere expected to organise a debate along a theme.  We had  to\r\n\r\nthink  of  a  theme, suggest it to the other members  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil, who of course have to agree.  And Singapore proposed\r\n\r\nthat  the  theme  for the Security Council debate  under  our\r\n\r\npresidency  should  be  on  the role  of  troop  contributing\r\n\r\ncountries in peace-keeping operations.  This was agreed to by\r\n\r\nboth  the  P5  and  the  other elected members  or  the  non-permanent  members.  We chose that theme because there  is  a\r\n\r\nreal  concern  in peace-keeping operations that the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil takes a decision to establish peace-keeping operation\r\n\r\nin  any particular conflict situation.  Nobody else can  take\r\n\r\nthe decision.  It is the Security Council, under the Charter.\r\n\r\nThe  Security Council takes the decision, then the Secretary-General invites countries called Troop Contributing Countries\r\n\r\n(TCCs) to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nprovide  contingents,  and  the PKO  is  launched.   But  the\r\n\r\ngrievance  of  many TCCs is that after the PKO  is  launched,\r\n\r\nthere  is very little consultation with them, there  is  very\r\n\r\nlittle  feedback  obtained  from  them,  and  sometimes   the\r\n\r\nmandates  of  the  PKOs are changed by the  Security  Council\r\n\r\nwithout consultation with countries who have ground forces in\r\n\r\nthat  conflict  situation, and sometimes, they  say,  to  the\r\n\r\ndetriment of the safety and well-being of their soldiers.  So\r\n\r\nthere  has been this disconnect between the Security Council,\r\n\r\nthe Secretariat and the Troop Contributing Countries, and  we\r\n\r\nthought it is good to have a session where all the members of\r\n\r\nthe  Security Council, plus the TCCs, can speak.  And we  had\r\n\r\nthis  debate  and I think, with some humility, the  consensus\r\n\r\nwas  that it was a very good idea, it was a good debate,  and\r\n\r\nit  was  not  just a rhetoric, as at the end of the  day  the\r\n\r\nSecurity  Council  decided to establish a  Working  Group  on\r\n\r\nPeace-keeping.  This working group will look further into the\r\n\r\nproposals  that were raised at the open debate  and  see  how\r\n\r\nthey can be implemented.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just cite that as one example of how a non-permanent member can play a constructive role. If there are\r\n\r\nother  areas in which Singapore during its term in two  years\r\n\r\ncan  similarly aid debate and discussion on such matters,  we\r\n\r\nwill be happy to do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Dr Ong Chit Chung's question whether, now that we\r\n\r\nare   in   the  Security  Council,  we  would  increase   the\r\n\r\nparticipation in the number of PKOs and would our quality  of\r\n\r\nparticipation change or increase, I would say that the answer\r\n\r\nto this question will have to be delinked from our membership\r\n\r\nin  the  Security Council.  This is a point that I have  made\r\n\r\nmany times, but I have to say it again.  The fact that we are\r\n\r\nin  the Security Council does not mean that suddenly we  must\r\n\r\nparticipate  in  a  flurry of activities, whether  in  peace-keeping, whether in giving aid, triple our aid or double  our\r\n\r\naid,  or  whether  we should set up more diplomatic  missions\r\n\r\njust because we are in the Security Council.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br>4.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We take a longer term view in our foreign policy. So\r\n\r\nthe  answer  to the question whether we support peace-keeping\r\n\r\noperations is, yes.  As a responsible member of the  Security\r\n\r\nCouncil and the UN, it is in our interest to show support for\r\n\r\nwell  thought-out  peace-keeping  operations  of  the  United\r\n\r\nNations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we participate? The answer is that we have\r\n\r\nparticipated in some 10 peace-keeping operations since  1991,\r\n\r\nand  72  members of our Armed Forces and Police are presently\r\n\r\nserving  in  three peace-keeping missions, and DPM  Tony  Tan\r\n\r\nmentioned  this.   Will we participate in more  peace-keeping\r\n\r\noperations?    This   is  something  that   the   Government,\r\n\r\nparticularly,  MINDEF and MHA, will certainly  consider.   It\r\n\r\nmust  depend,  first,  on  the nature  of  the  peace-keeping\r\n\r\noperation  and  the  situation  in  which  it  is  conceived.\r\n\r\nSecond,  obviously,  it  must also depend  on  the  resources\r\n\r\navailable, both MINDEF and MHA.  But beyond that, I  am  not,\r\n\r\nat  the  moment, able to give any commitment as to which  new\r\n\r\nPKOs we will participate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members for their very supportive comments about\r\n\r\nSingapore's  participation  as  a  member  of  the   Security\r\n\r\nCouncil.   I take it as a very challenging task for Singapore\r\n\r\nand  this  is probably once in a blue moon kind of situation.\r\n\r\nWe  will  do our best to live up to the expectations  of  not\r\n\r\nonly Singaporeans but other countries who have voted us in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his comments and question on resources, yes, we\r\n\r\nhave sent extra officers from MFA and also personnel from the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence to augment our team in the UN during this\r\n\r\ntwo-year period.  They are doing an excellent job in  working\r\n\r\ntogether with MFA headquarters and other agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to ask the Ministry to\r\n\r\nconsider  a  review  of major human rights  treaties  and  to\r\n\r\nconsider Singapore's accession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore aims to be a democratic society based on\r\n\r\njustice  and  equality.  That is part  of  our  pledge.   Our\r\n\r\njudicial system\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nis  highly rated.  Some Government leaders have from time  to\r\n\r\ntime  spoken  on  Asian values and how an Asian  approach  to\r\n\r\nhuman  rights  might defer from Western  values.   They  have\r\n\r\nhowever  acknowledged that some human rights  are  universal,\r\n\r\nsuch as the protection against slavery or against genocide.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.20 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Singapore has acceded to three human rights\r\n\r\ntreaties.     They    are    the    Convention    for     the\r\n\r\nElimination/Protection against Genocide,  Convention  on  the\r\n\r\nRights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of  All\r\n\r\nForms  of Discrimination against Women.  First, I would  like\r\n\r\nto   ask  the  Minister  what  the  experience  has  been  in\r\n\r\nundertaking these Conventions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Sir, I would like to encourage the Government to\r\n\r\nchange  laws  and  policies to give  these  Conventions  full\r\n\r\neffect.  We have generally done so whenever we have taken  on\r\n\r\nan  international  commitment, for example, WTO  commitments.\r\n\r\nWe  changed our intellectual property laws to keep  in  touch\r\n\r\nwith the trade-related property regime under WTO.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, it concerns me that we have not fully\r\n\r\nacceded  to  some  of the things required by  the  Convention\r\n\r\nagainst  Genocide.  In particular, Article 5 of the  Genocide\r\n\r\nConvention  requires  that genocide be  made  a  crime  under\r\n\r\nSingapore law.  Clearly, Sir, murder is a crime in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBut  that  is not the same crime as genocide and  it  is  not\r\n\r\nclear  today  whether  Singapore  courts  would  enforce  the\r\n\r\ninternational  crime of genocide.  I use that  simply  as  an\r\n\r\nexample.   I would like us, having signed these treaties,  to\r\n\r\nensure that all our laws and policies comply.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point, Sir, is that having signed on to these\r\n\r\ntreaties,  I  would encourage the Ministry to make  Singapore\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  civil society groups more  aware  and  have  a\r\n\r\nbetter understanding of these Conventions.  Some are somehow\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunder  the  impression  that we do not observe  human  rights\r\n\r\nconventions at all and this clearly should be changed.  As  I\r\n\r\nsaid  at  the  start, we generally have a good  human  rights\r\n\r\nrecord and should help our citizens understand it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third and final point, Sir, is that I hope our\r\n\r\nGovernment would seriously consider other major human  rights\r\n\r\ntreaties  and  consider  acceding to  them  in  future.   Two\r\n\r\nexamples   that   come  to  my  mind  are  the  International\r\n\r\nConvention  on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination  and,\r\n\r\nsecondly,  the  Convention against Torture.   On  the  first,\r\n\r\nparticularly  on eliminating racial discrimination,  that  is\r\n\r\nsomething Singapore should be proud of and should aim to  set\r\n\r\nworld  standard.   And  we  should consider  joining  in  the\r\n\r\ninternational  community's effort in  upholding  these  human\r\n\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, may I know how much time we have\r\n\r\nunder this amendment?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> About 10 minutes for the whole amendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Thank you. Sir, Mr Simon Tay made\r\n\r\nthree points.  First, whether we can sign international human\r\n\r\nrights treaties.  He noted that we have signed some treaties.\r\n\r\nI  take it he is really arguing that there are other treaties\r\n\r\nwhich  we  should sign and he has asked what is our state  of\r\n\r\nreview  of this.  Secondly, he has made the point that,  when\r\n\r\nwe  do  sign  and accede to the conventions, we  should  also\r\n\r\nexpeditiously enact legislation to implement those  treaties.\r\n\r\nThird,  he  made  the  point about publicising  the  relevant\r\n\r\npolicies under the treaty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take each of these points. On his first point,\r\n\r\nyes,  we  do  systematically review the various international\r\n\r\nconventions   and  treaties,  including  the   human   rights\r\n\r\ntreaties, because they are not the only treaties.  There  are\r\n\r\nmany  other  treaties.   And we have  a  mechanism  involving\r\n\r\nseveral Ministries which will review these treaties.  When we\r\n\r\ncan\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\naccede  to the treaty, we do so but only after a very careful\r\n\r\nexamination of the situation.  By that, I mean it is not that\r\n\r\nwe  do not want to accede to the treaty.  But our approach is\r\n\r\nthat,  when we adhere to an international treaty, we want  to\r\n\r\nbe  sure  that  we will be able to implement  the  provisions\r\n\r\nfaithfully,  or put it the other way, we do not  want  to  be\r\n\r\naccused, after we have become a state party, that we  are  in\r\n\r\nbreach of the provisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before we take the decision, we consult all\r\n\r\nour  agencies.   Are we able to implement this  treaty?   And\r\n\r\nonly when we conclude that we will be able to do so, then  we\r\n\r\nproceed.   And  we are party to several of the  human  rights\r\n\r\nconventions,  like  Genocide Convention,  Convention  on  the\r\n\r\nElimination  of  All Forms of Discrimination  against  Women,\r\n\r\nConvention of the Rights of the Child, like Optional protocol\r\n\r\nto  the  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child  on  the\r\n\r\ninvolvement of children and armed conflicts which was  signed\r\n\r\nduring  the  Millennium Summit last year.  We  are  currently\r\n\r\nalso  reviewing the Convention that he referred to, that  is,\r\n\r\nthe  International  Convention on the Elimination  of  Racial\r\n\r\nDiscrimination to see whether we can sign that and  become  a\r\n\r\nparty to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point he made was, when we become a party to a\r\n\r\ntreaty,  we  must  enact  legislation  to  implement  it,   a\r\n\r\nproposition  which I do not disagree.  It  must  follow  that\r\n\r\nwhen  you  adhere  to a treaty, if the treaty  requires  that\r\n\r\nlegislation  to  be enacted, you must enact  the  legislation\r\n\r\nbecause  the general principle in international law  is  that\r\n\r\nyou  cannot  cite  inadequacy of your law as  an  excuse  for\r\n\r\nfailure  to  fulfill your international obligations.   Having\r\n\r\nsaid  that, let me say that we make it a point to ensure that\r\n\r\nwe do not fail in that international obligation.  So if there\r\n\r\nis an obligation to enact legislation, we will do so.  But if\r\n\r\nthere is no obligation to enact, and if it is a discretionary\r\n\r\nposition,  then  we will examine whether our  other  body  of\r\n\r\nlaws,  our  legal  framework, enables us to comply  with  the\r\n\r\ninternational    convention   without    enacting    specific\r\n\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He referred specifically to the Genocide Convention as\r\n\r\nan   example  where  we  had  not  really  carried  out   our\r\n\r\nobligations.  I am the Minister for Law but I must be  guided\r\n\r\nby  the  legal experts and all legal experts in the Attorney-General's  Chambers  actually advise  us  that  there  is  no\r\n\r\nmandatory  obligation to enact specific delegated legislation\r\n\r\nfor the Genocide Convention.  But having said that, we are in\r\n\r\nany  case  looking  at drafts of legislation  which  we  will\r\n\r\ninclude  in  the Penal Code during a broader  review  of  the\r\n\r\nPenal  Code  legislation.  But because we have  been  advised\r\n\r\nthat   there  is  no  immediate  obligation  to   enact   the\r\n\r\nlegislation,  we  are not treating it with pressing  urgency.\r\n\r\nAnd  some  time  later,  when  we  have  the  next  round  of\r\n\r\namendments to the Penal Code, we will see whether  we  should\r\n\r\ninclude provisions of the Genocide Convention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, his point about publicity. Yes, when we have\r\n\r\nimportant new conventions which we have acceded to,  we  make\r\n\r\nit  a  point  to have publicity.  A good example is  when  we\r\n\r\nbecame  a party to the Convention on the Elimination  of  All\r\n\r\nForms  of  Discrimination against Women, an Inter-Ministerial\r\n\r\nCommittee,  chaired by Ministry of Community Development  and\r\n\r\nSports,  had overseen implementation of our obligations,  but\r\n\r\nalso they had various activities - forums, workshops, and  so\r\n\r\non  -  with  individuals,  interest groups,  NGOs,  to  raise\r\n\r\nawareness  about  the  obligations  and  policies  under  the\r\n\r\nConvention.   I take his point that we should  do  this  with\r\n\r\nevery major convention.  And in reply, I do not disagree with\r\n\r\nhim.   But  this is being done, and if it can be improved,  I\r\n\r\nshall  welcome suggestions on this matter.  I believe I  have\r\n\r\ntouched on his main points.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case we are cut off by the guillotine under\r\n\r\nAmendment  No.  (1),  I  hope that those  who  did  not  have\r\n\r\nsatisfaction  of  replies to the remaining items  would  feel\r\n\r\nfree to file a question and we will be happy to answer later.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I intend to end the discussion on this\r\n\r\namendment at 4.44 pm.

This humanitarian act was\r\n\r\ngiven  prominent  coverage in both our  print  and  broadcast\r\n\r\nmedia.  It was, therefore, a rude shock to subsequently  read\r\n\r\nthe  criticisms  of a Straits Times reader, who  pointed  out\r\n\r\nthat the Singapore Government's contribution was paltry.  Was\r\n\r\nour  Government  indeed parsimonious in extending  aid  to  a\r\n\r\nfriend in need?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singapore has demonstrated its sincerity to lend a\r\n\r\nhelping hand by responding instantly to the crisis, how  much\r\n\r\nwe  contribute would obviously affect our international image\r\n\r\nas  a  donor.  Others are likely to compare the sum given  by\r\n\r\nthe   Singapore   Government  to  the   country's   financial\r\n\r\nresources.  In other words, our willingness to donate  versus\r\n\r\nour  ability to donate.  Little wonder that the Straits Times\r\n\r\nreader  concluded  that  the sum  of  US$50,000  was  paltry,\r\n\r\nrelative to our budget surpluses and national reserves.   The\r\n\r\nfact  that  another S$4 million was raised  in  nearly  three\r\n\r\nweeks  from  Singaporeans, who responded  generously  to  the\r\n\r\ndonation  drives  by the various organisations,  appeared  to\r\n\r\nfurther diminish the impact of the initial contribution  from\r\n\r\nthe   Government.   Could  the  Minister  elaborate  on   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's policy with regard to granting aid to  disaster-struck less-developed countries?  What criteria do we use  in\r\n\r\ndeciding  the quantum of assistance to be given to  countries\r\n\r\nin need?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, I share the sentiments expressed\r\n\r\nby  my  colleague  that many Singaporeans  thought  that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment's contribution of US$50,000 to the recent disaster\r\n\r\nin  India  could have been better.  However, I note that  our\r\n\r\nGovernment  has also been helpful in providing assistance  in\r\n\r\nother  forms as well to other countries, and these programmes\r\n\r\nare not often publicised.  It is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunfortunate  that  the  issue  of  our  contribution  to  the\r\n\r\ndisaster relief effort in India is now firmly etched  in  the\r\n\r\nminds of the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to ask the\r\n\r\nMinister,   therefore,  to  clarify  whether  our  Government\r\n\r\nconsiders  our aid contribution to be reasonable and  whether\r\n\r\nthis  is  in  keeping  with  what  the  other  countries  are\r\n\r\ncontributing and, secondly, to give us an explanation  as  to\r\n\r\nour policy of providing foreign aid to the other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, I am glad to hear earlier in the\r\n\r\ndebate  from the Minister that Singapore has been  active  in\r\n\r\nextending  technical cooperation and technical assistance  to\r\n\r\nother  developing countries.  We have shown that even  though\r\n\r\nwe  are small, we have a constructive role to play in helping\r\n\r\nfellow  developing countries to develop more quickly.   As  a\r\n\r\nmember   of   the  international  community,  Singapore   has\r\n\r\nbenefited  in  the  early years of its development  from  the\r\n\r\nbenevolence of more developed countries not only in terms  of\r\n\r\nfunding  but  also  with  expert advice  and  financial  aid.\r\n\r\nWithout  these, we would not have been able to  overcome  the\r\n\r\nobstacles  of  a  young nation dependent on  mainly  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our parents' generation, when Singapore was just\r\n\r\nstarting  out, they had to look after those in need  at  home\r\n\r\nfirst,  at  the  same time that our leaders  were  fulfilling\r\n\r\nbasic  social  needs  of housing and creating  jobs  for  our\r\n\r\npopulation.  Our children's generation has grown up in an era\r\n\r\nof  affluence where these basic societal needs have been more\r\n\r\nthan  met.   Singapore, therefore, has  a  responsibility  to\r\n\r\nassist those less fortunate and less developed than we are.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read and heard about the response of our people\r\n\r\nand Government to the disasters and crises around the region,\r\n\r\nand  sometimes  even beyond as in the case of  Turkey,  I  am\r\n\r\nassured and heartened that our society is progressing in  the\r\n\r\nright  direction.   However, Singapore is  a  small  country,\r\n\r\nsmall in size and its resources are limited compared to  more\r\n\r\ndeveloped countries.  Because of these, I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge  that we focus on those  disasters  and\r\n\r\ncrises  in which we can respond quickly and in a manner  that\r\n\r\nis  sufficient to make a significant contribution.  To spread\r\n\r\nour   resources  too  widely  would  only  serve  to   invite\r\n\r\nundeserved criticisms that our contributions are not enough.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, may I ask the Minister to clarify the\r\n\r\naims and objectives of Singapore's humanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, I have\r\n\r\nlistened  with interest Members' comments and concerns  about\r\n\r\nSingapore's training programmes for foreign countries and our\r\n\r\ncontributions to specific natural disasters abroad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we are doing too little or paltry, or not\r\n\r\nenough,  depends  on one's perspective.  Our  perspective  is\r\n\r\nthat as a member of the international community, we will have\r\n\r\nto  play our part in assisting other countries.  That is  for\r\n\r\nsure.  But we have to remember that at the end of the day, we\r\n\r\nare  a small country.  Singapore is not in the big league  of\r\n\r\nmajor  donor  countries.  We do not pretend  to  be  a  major\r\n\r\ndonor,  nor  do  we aspire to be one.  Our focus  in  helping\r\n\r\nfellow   countries  has  always  been  on   giving   tangible\r\n\r\nassistance and not simple monetary disbursements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at what Singapore is doing to assist\r\n\r\ncountries, I would ask Members first to look at the technical\r\n\r\nassistance  and  training that we provide  in  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nCooperation Programme (SCP).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's major contributions to foreign assistance\r\n\r\nrest  in  our  Technical Cooperation Programme.   Because  we\r\n\r\nourselves  benefited from such assistance in our early  days,\r\n\r\nwe   believe  that  the  way  to  help  developing  countries\r\n\r\nmeaningfully  is  through  the  development  of  their  human\r\n\r\nresources.  The Singapore Cooperation Programme, for example,\r\n\r\nin   FY1999,  the  SCP  trained  3,145  officials  from   110\r\n\r\ncountries.  In FY2000, which is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  yet  complete,  trainees so far  number  3,293  from  94\r\n\r\ncountries.   That works out to an average of 274 participants\r\n\r\nand 16 training courses per month.  The total expenditure for\r\n\r\nFY1999 was $17.5 million and, for FY2000, expenditure to date\r\n\r\nis $14.6 million.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask Members to pause and reflect on these\r\n\r\nfigures.  For Singapore to train over 3,000 foreign officials\r\n\r\neach  year is no mean feat.  Since 1992, the SCP has  trained\r\n\r\nover 15,000 officials from 138 countries.  The number is even\r\n\r\nlarger if you add what other Singapore agencies, beyond  MFA,\r\n\r\ndo.   In FY1999, for example, when we add the expenditure  by\r\n\r\nother  Government Ministries and agencies which shared  their\r\n\r\ndata with MFA, the cumulative number of foreigners trained in\r\n\r\nSingapore  stood at 6,160 from over 110 developing countries.\r\n\r\nThe  total  training cost was S$41 million.  I  believe  that\r\n\r\nwhen  we  add  these  efforts up, Members  would  agree  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  doing  its  fair share  in  rendering  foreign\r\n\r\nassistance to other developing countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like next to turn to the comments by\r\n\r\nMembers   on   Singapore's  contributions   to   humanitarian\r\n\r\nassistance.   Singapore  renders humanitarian  assistance  to\r\n\r\naffected  countries  in  various forms,  including  financial\r\n\r\ncontributions,  the provision of rations and  equipment  and,\r\n\r\nwhere time and travel arrangements permit, rescue and medical\r\n\r\nteams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999 and 2000, for instance, Singapore dispensed over\r\n\r\n$12  million  in humanitarian assistance to Indonesia  alone.\r\n\r\nThis  includes supplies of rice and medicine.  Singapore  was\r\n\r\nalso the first country to offer disaster relief to victims of\r\n\r\nthe  earthquake  in  Bengkulu, Sumatra,  in  June  2000.   In\r\n\r\nresponse to a request by the Indonesian Government, Singapore\r\n\r\nsent  a 20-member SAF medical team to Bengkulu, together with\r\n\r\nemergency medical supplies and tents worth S$50,000.  An  SAF\r\n\r\ndoctor was also despatched to help the UN Disaster Assessment\r\n\r\nand Coordination Mission to Bengkulu.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2000, Singapore contributed to seven\r\n\r\nhumanitarian assistance efforts\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin Cambodia, twice in Vietnam, Laos, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and\r\n\r\nBotswana,   amounting  to  over  $200,000.   In  1999,   five\r\n\r\ncontributions to Mozambique, Kosovo, twice in Indonesia,  and\r\n\r\nTurkey, amounted to $765,600 - again, not a mean sum.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the earthquake in Gujarat, as referred to by\r\n\r\nMembers just now, the RSAF airlifted a planeload of emergency\r\n\r\nsupplies worth about $87,000 as an immediate response.   This\r\n\r\nwas   followed   by  another  $34,000  in  medical   supplies\r\n\r\ndespatched by the RSN, which also helped to ferry 17 tons  of\r\n\r\nfood,  clothing and medicine donated by Singaporeans  to  the\r\n\r\nearthquake-stricken   area.   These  efforts   were   further\r\n\r\nsupplemented by the Singapore Red Cross and other  charitable\r\n\r\nor  community-based organisations, which  have  since  raised\r\n\r\nover  $4  million  in  donations  for  the  victims  of   the\r\n\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it is worth emphasising that the\r\n\r\namount  or  type  of  humanitarian assistance  given  by  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government is not intended to match the  scale  of\r\n\r\nthe  disaster.  Rather, it is a show of moral support  and  a\r\n\r\ngesture  of  sympathy to the affected country.  Through  such\r\n\r\nefforts,  we  hope  to  catalyse  further  contributions  and\r\n\r\nsupport  from all Singaporeans to agencies such  as  the  Red\r\n\r\nCross or other community-based groups.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do appreciate Mr Sin's and Mr Chong's points\r\n\r\nthat such assistance from Singapore could be better presented\r\n\r\nto  the  public and to the international community,  so  that\r\n\r\nthere  is  greater awareness of the total efforts put  in  by\r\n\r\nSingapore.    They   are  correct  in  pointing   out   that,\r\n\r\nultimately, it is the totality of humanitarian assistance  by\r\n\r\nall    Singaporeans,    both   Government    and    community\r\n\r\ncontributions,  that is appreciated by the affected  country.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans   have  always  contributed  generously   during\r\n\r\ndisasters,  and  we  should recognise  and  acknowledge  such\r\n\r\ngenerosity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to reassure Members that as we gain more\r\n\r\nexperience  in such events, MFA will continue to  review  and\r\n\r\nimprove  not  only the way in which we despatch  humanitarian\r\n\r\nassistance, but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  the way in which we package and present it to the world\r\n\r\nat large.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, first, a point of\r\n\r\nclarification.  When I earlier talked about our agenda at the\r\n\r\nUN  Security  Council,  I  did not mean  the  formal  meeting\r\n\r\nagenda, but what we set out to achieve and what we set out to\r\n\r\ndo.   In  any  case, we want to thank the Ministers  and  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Parliamentary Secretary for their very  comprehensive\r\n\r\nanswers, and I am confident that our foreign relations are in\r\n\r\ngood  hands.   On  that  note, I beg  leave  to  withdraw  my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Mr Simon Tay.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I beg to move,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head O of the Main\r\n\r\nEstimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code OA 1500.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard the Minister about the efforts to assist\r\n\r\nand  integrate newer ASEAN member states in his earlier reply\r\n\r\non  ASEAN.  I accept that there are limits to what we can  do\r\n\r\nand  that we are best placed to serve as a catalyst.   But  I\r\n\r\nthink  that  we  should really be trying to do  more.   If  I\r\n\r\nremember the answer correctly, the number of scholarships  to\r\n\r\nbe  given to the new ASEAN members is 60.  Sir, I think there\r\n\r\nis a place for highly specialised elite scholarships, eg, the\r\n\r\nLee  Kuan  Yew Exchange Fellowship for ASEAN is a  good  one.\r\n\r\nBut,  more broadly, there is a need to reach out more  deeply\r\n\r\nto help these newer members integrate and upgrade themselves.\r\n\r\nI  would put it that 60 may be too few.  We should be aiming,\r\n\r\nwithin  our capacity, to be serving somewhat like a Fulbright\r\n\r\nExchange Programme, through which many people have benefited.\r\n\r\nSo,  over  time,  many people would have come  to  Singapore,\r\n\r\ngained from studying here, and gone back with both skills and\r\n\r\ngood  memories of Singapore, particularly when  the  National\r\n\r\nUniversity  of  Singapore has an enrolment  of  about,  if  I\r\n\r\nremember correctly, 16,000.  In this sense, 60 is perhaps too\r\n\r\nfew, considering how much\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncapacity  we  have, not just with this university,  but  with\r\n\r\nthree universities now on line.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take the next cut?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Please do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the next cut relates to the future\r\n\r\nof ASEAN+3 and ASEAN itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard in this House and outside, many have\r\n\r\nemphasised, that Northeast Asia has come up dramatically, and\r\n\r\nthat  is  true.   Of course, Northeast Asian  countries  have\r\n\r\nalways been the bigger economies since China's opening.   The\r\n\r\nrelativity has shifted, but those three up north have  always\r\n\r\nbeen bigger.  There are many good reasons to engage Northeast\r\n\r\nAsia and I think we are doing the right thing with ASEAN+3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I think there are two main dangers that I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Ministry will address.  The first is that  ASEAN+3\r\n\r\nshould  not be an exclusive and closed group.  It should  not\r\n\r\nbe  a  bloc  which  is self-confining.   The  USA  and  other\r\n\r\npartners  remain  important to the Asia  Pacific  and,  while\r\n\r\nincreasing our cooperation with Northeast Asia, we should not\r\n\r\nignore  these  other ties.  Secondly, Singapore should  avoid\r\n\r\nthe danger of neglecting ASEAN or of being perceived as doing\r\n\r\nso.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I would ask the Minister to share his thinking about\r\n\r\nhow  to balance these different needs of strengthening ASEAN,\r\n\r\nASEAN+3, and the broader Asia-Pacific framework.\r\n\r\n<br>4.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Charles Chong is not speaking. Mr\r\n\r\nRavindran.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Myanmar has been dealt with differently\r\n\r\nby  two  opposing groups of countries and regional groupings.\r\n\r\nOn  the one hand, we have ASEAN, China, Japan, etc, who  hope\r\n\r\nthat  constructive  engagement would  democratise  and  bring\r\n\r\nabout change in Myanmar progressively.  On the other hand, we\r\n\r\nhave states that are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nusing the stick approach and advocate liberal democracy at  a\r\n\r\nquicker  pace  of change for Myanmar, eg, the European  Union\r\n\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update as to\r\n\r\nwhether Singapore's and ASEAN's approach to Myanmar has  bore\r\n\r\nfruit  and  also whether Myanmar, as an issue, has held  back\r\n\r\nrelations between ASEAN and the European Union.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to some extent, the questions\r\n\r\nraised by Mr Simon Tay were fully covered by me in the fuller\r\n\r\nresponses  that  I  have given on the  amendments  raised  by\r\n\r\nMembers  in the first part of our debate on Foreign  Affairs.\r\n\r\nWhat  I  would do is to recapitulate the key points  which  I\r\n\r\nhave made.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Simon Tay wishes to underscore the importance\r\n\r\nof  assisting  other countries in ASEAN.   I  have  mentioned\r\n\r\nearlier  that this was a concern that Singapore expressed  at\r\n\r\nthe ASEAN Informal Summit and Prime Minister Goh made this  a\r\n\r\ncentral point at the summit when we spoke about the need  for\r\n\r\nintegration. When we talk about the need for integration,  we\r\n\r\nare  trying  to prevent an ASEAN divide between the  founding\r\n\r\ncountries,  or  those  who  are  better  off,  and   Vietnam,\r\n\r\nCambodia,  Laos and Myanmar, on the other hand.  The  leaders\r\n\r\ntook  note  of the need to avoid a two-tier ASEAN.   All  the\r\n\r\nproposals  that came out from that Informal Summit were  with\r\n\r\nthis concern uppermost in the minds of the leaders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at Singapore's contributions to the\r\n\r\ndiscussions  at the summit, it was not just rhetoric.   Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Goh  proposed,  and  the  leaders  accepted,   some\r\n\r\nconcrete  ideas to advance this process of ASEAN integration.\r\n\r\nSingapore's proposals include, as I said this afternoon,  the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of Skills Development Training  institutes  in\r\n\r\nthe  four  countries.  It would involve training of trainers,\r\n\r\nconsultants,  researchers in areas such as trade development,\r\n\r\nexport   promotion,  human  resource  development   and   IT.\r\n\r\nSecondly,  a  five-year  package of  IT  \"Train-the-Trainers\"\r\n\r\ncourses  for  each  of these countries.   In  fact,  we  have\r\n\r\noffered 10 IT \"Train-the-Trainers\" courses for this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThirdly,  it  also involves an education \"Train-the-Trainers\"\r\n\r\nprogramme   which   would  focus  on  teacher   and   trainer\r\n\r\ndevelopment  and  that  would focus on  teaching  skills  and\r\n\r\nresources   which   would  spearhead  economic   and   social\r\n\r\ndevelopments  in  Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar  and  Vietnam.   We\r\n\r\naccept  60  vocational, polytechnic and university  lecturers\r\n\r\nannually  from  these countries who will be attached  to  our\r\n\r\nlocal institutions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to that, the Singapore scholarships that we\r\n\r\nhave  under  our cooperation programme, which  my  colleague,\r\n\r\nSenior Parliamentary Secretary has outlined earlier, would be\r\n\r\ndoubled  from 30 to 60 per academic year.  I go back  to  the\r\n\r\npoint that my colleague, Mr Zainul Abidin made.  If you  view\r\n\r\nthis  as  too little, not enough, we have to do what we  can,\r\n\r\nbut  within the limits of our resources.  That does not  just\r\n\r\ninclude  individual  resources.  It also  includes  what  our\r\n\r\ninstitutes  can  cope  with.  These are  not  figures  to  be\r\n\r\nsniffed at and they are appreciated by the countries  in  the\r\n\r\nregion.   And where we lack the expertise, what we do  is  to\r\n\r\nteam  up with other countries or other agencies, because part\r\n\r\nof our Singapore Cooperation Programme involves third country\r\n\r\ntraining  agreements, which we have with other countries,  as\r\n\r\nwell  as with international organisations, whether it is  the\r\n\r\nUNDP,  WTO, World Bank and so on.  And sometimes, jointly  we\r\n\r\nrun  the  programme.  That enables us to pool  resources  and\r\n\r\nperhaps also share expenditure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his remarks concerning ASEAN+3, here again, I have to\r\n\r\nrecapitulate  my fuller answer earlier, and  that  is,  ASEAN\r\n\r\nmust work within several areas of networking.  ASEAN plays  a\r\n\r\nrole  in ARF. We have played a role and will continue to play\r\n\r\na role in ASEAN-EU dialogue to engage the Europeans. Then, we\r\n\r\nhave  the  Asia-Europe  Meeting. Some members  of  ASEAN  are\r\n\r\ninvolved in APEC and we have some newer initiatives like  the\r\n\r\nEast  Asia-Latin America Forum.  It is in this  context  that\r\n\r\nyou  have  to  view the ASEAN+3.  It is one of many  ways  of\r\n\r\nengaging  different  countries  and  different  regions.  The\r\n\r\nrationale for ASEAN+3 is, as the Member\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhimself  said,  for Southeast Asia to engage  with  Northeast\r\n\r\nAsia.  How this process will go, I am not sure, but it  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess that is important because ASEAN has to engage  China,\r\n\r\nJapan  and  Korea, both in economic cooperation  as  well  as\r\n\r\ninvolve  them  in  discussions on matters of security-related\r\n\r\nissues in Asia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made an important point which I fully agree with,\r\n\r\nand  that is, when we participate, all our driving forces  in\r\n\r\nthese  different circles of engagement with other  countries,\r\n\r\nSingapore's  approach is that this cannot be  totally  closed\r\n\r\nshop  and  totally  non-inclusive  processes.   We  must   be\r\n\r\nprepared  to  have  an open mind and to  welcome  others  who\r\n\r\nexpress an  interest.  That has been Singapore's approach and\r\n\r\nit  is  this approach, for example, that we will continue  to\r\n\r\nadopt,  whether  it  is  ARF,  where  Singapore  argued   and\r\n\r\nadvocated  the  participation of India,  we  supported  North\r\n\r\nKorea and Mongolia's participation.  At the same time, it  is\r\n\r\nnot  something that Singapore can impose its will on  others,\r\n\r\nwhose views and positions are necessary to forge a consensus.\r\n\r\nBehind  the  scene, we would argue for an open and  inclusive\r\n\r\nprocess, but it may have to be gradual.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relates to a point that Mr Simon Tay made in an\r\n\r\nearlier intervention about our approach to Australia and  New\r\n\r\nZealand  which,  because  of  time,  we  have  not   had   an\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  reply.  But that is  an  approach  which  we\r\n\r\nbelieve  in,  that  Australia and New Zealand  are  countries\r\n\r\nwhich  ought  to  be  brought  into  closer  interaction  and\r\n\r\nparticipation  in  various discussions  and  forums,  whether\r\n\r\neconomic, political or security dialogues in our region. That\r\n\r\nis  the  kind  of  thinking which  led  us  to  propose  that\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  New Zealand should be in the East  Asia-Latin\r\n\r\nAmerica  Forum.   Here again, if there are  reservations  and\r\n\r\nvoices  to the contrary, we will continue to work behind  the\r\n\r\nscene  to  persuade  those whose agreement  and  consent  are\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Myanmar, in response to Mr Ravindran, I would say\r\n\r\nthat Singapore is not a country that has the habit of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstanding  on  the  roof-top, making a  big  pronouncement  on\r\n\r\nanother  country's internal development.  But we do,  in  our\r\n\r\nown  quiet way, from time to time, make known our views,  and\r\n\r\nsuggestions to our colleagues in Myanmar, as to how they  can\r\n\r\nhelp  themselves meet some of the criticisms which they  face\r\n\r\nin  international  forums.   This  is  part  of  constructive\r\n\r\ndiplomacy.   I  would  say  that  the  other  ASEAN   Foreign\r\n\r\nMinisters and I have had useful discussions with our  Myanmar\r\n\r\ncounterpart.  This is different from their approaches of some\r\n\r\nof  the  Western countries.  I do not wish to  criticise  the\r\n\r\napproach of any other country.  Different approaches  may  be\r\n\r\nuseful in this regard, but you would have noticed that  there\r\n\r\nhave  been some recent positive developments in Myanmar.   It\r\n\r\nis  encouraging  to see both the Myanmar government  and  the\r\n\r\nopposition engaging in a dialogue. All we can do is  to  wish\r\n\r\nthem  well in this on-going process.  I believe that it  does\r\n\r\nshow,   to   some  extent,  that  ASEAN's  quiet  policy   of\r\n\r\nconstructive engagement may be bearing fruit, although  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think we should take entire credit for it.   There  have\r\n\r\nbeen  other  parties who have been involved in  this  process\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Special Representative of the United  Nations'\r\n\r\nSecretary-General.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ASEAN-EU dialogue, and whether Myanmar has been a\r\n\r\nproblem, I would not say that it is Myanmar which has been  a\r\n\r\nproblem.   If  I may elaborate a bit on what I said  earlier.\r\n\r\nIt  was because the European Union took a stand, and it is  a\r\n\r\nstand which they could not reverse without consensus, that so\r\n\r\nlong as they had the policy, they would not be able to have a\r\n\r\nmeeting  in Europe of Foreign Ministers from both sides  when\r\n\r\nthe  Foreign Minister of Myanmar attends.  They had  taken  a\r\n\r\ndecision  that they would not give a visa.  Our approach  was\r\n\r\nthat we do not dictate to them what their policy should be on\r\n\r\nMyanmar.   But whatever their policy on Myanmar,  why  should\r\n\r\nthey jeopardise and derail our long-standing dialogue process\r\n\r\nwhich ASEAN and EU have had as a group-to-group position?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a postponement of the ASEAN-EU meeting, which was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to have taken place in Berlin, and therefore  there\r\n\r\nwas  an  impasse, we had quiet diplomacy between the European\r\n\r\nand the ASEAN side and we, therefore, made a breakthrough  by\r\n\r\nhaving  the ASEAN-EU Meeting in Vientiane.  My suggestion  to\r\n\r\nthe  European  Minister was:  it is far better  to  have  the\r\n\r\nMyanmar  Foreign  Minister present there,  ask  him  whatever\r\n\r\nquestions you want to ask and let him reply.  That is exactly\r\n\r\nwhat  took  place  in Vientiane.  That dialogue  took  place,\r\n\r\nwhether the EU were persuaded or not by explanations  of  the\r\n\r\nMyanmar Foreign Minister, I do not know. But we were about to\r\n\r\nget  on with other aspects of ASEAN-EU dialogue relationship,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  very important.  It is one of the oldest  dialogue\r\n\r\nrelationships ASEAN has with other countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me round up by saying that when\r\n\r\nyou  talk  about ASEAN playing a role in all these  different\r\n\r\ndialogue  processes, ultimately, ASEAN must show that  it  is\r\n\r\nmaking  serious  efforts to get its economic and  other  acts\r\n\r\ntogether so that some of the shine and lustre which have lost\r\n\r\nwill  come back. For other countries, other dialogue partners\r\n\r\nor other organisations, when they deal with ASEAN, they would\r\n\r\nlike  to know whether ASEAN is a credible organisation:   has\r\n\r\nit  gained  stability and some of the dynamism which  it  was\r\n\r\nassociated before the financial crisis and before many of the\r\n\r\ncountries were beset by political and economic problems?   It\r\n\r\nis  critical that ASEAN gets its acts together.   Only  then,\r\n\r\nthese  dialogue relationships can be taken seriously  by  all\r\n\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my\r\n\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $196,936,200 for Head O ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Main Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $76,249,000 for Head O ordered to stand part\r\n\r\nof the Development Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head U -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head U - Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.

In formulating a concept plan, it  is\r\n\r\nimportant  that long-term planning parameters are adopted  so\r\n\r\nas  to meet the desired outcomes.  Singapore is a land scarce\r\n\r\ncountry.   The  planning of land use plays a  vital  role  in\r\n\r\ndetermining the kind of society and the environment in  which\r\n\r\nwe will live in.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that it may be difficult to forecast the\r\n\r\nfuture.   We  must,  nevertheless,  adopt  a  practical   and\r\n\r\nflexible  approach when drafting our new  concept  plan.   It\r\n\r\nmust  be  forward  looking  and  have  provisions  to  inject\r\n\r\nflexibility  to  meet changing demands of our  society.   The\r\n\r\nconcept  plan must also adopt a longer time-frame,  maybe  30\r\n\r\nyears, to enable both businesses and individuals to plan  for\r\n\r\ntheir future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that URA has formed two focus groups to\r\n\r\ngather  feedback  on  the  proposed  Concept  Plan  21.    In\r\n\r\naddition,  I  would like to highlight the following  concerns\r\n\r\nwhich I hope the Minister can clarify:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) What are the long-term planning parameters adopted\r\n\r\nwhen the Concept Plan 21 was drafted?  Can the URA explain to\r\n\r\nthe general public how these parameters have been derived?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) What are the projected figures for population\r\n\r\ngrowth,  foreign manpower, and immigration over the next  10,\r\n\r\n20 or 30 years?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) What is the long-term mix of public and private\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;housing?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) How do we provide adequate \"green lungs\" in our\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high-density and high rise built environment?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) How do we reduce the effects of warming in our\r\n\r\nbuilt environment, and address environmental concerns such as\r\n\r\nair, water, solid waste, chemical and noise pollution?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) Can we relocate our military airports to offshore\r\n\r\nislands so as to free up valuable land as well as lower noise\r\n\r\nlevels?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) What are the developmental provisions made to\r\n\r\nsupport future lifestyles of Singaporeans which include  more\r\n\r\npro-family living?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, prior to the development and\r\n\r\nfinalisation  of the Concept Plan, the URA had  convened  two\r\n\r\nfocus  groups  to act as focal points for ideas and  feedback\r\n\r\nfor  a  wide  cross-section  of  the  population.   This   is\r\n\r\ncommendable as URA and everyone involved have benefitted from\r\n\r\nthe  experience.   I  would like to add  my  views  on  three\r\n\r\nissues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first point is that Singapore is an island state with\r\n\r\nlimited  land  resources.  We are a city and  a  country  all\r\n\r\nrolled  into one.  Therefore, in planning for our nation,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  meet  a  number  of  critical  needs   -   housing,\r\n\r\nindustries, airports, harbour, military training, reservoirs,\r\n\r\nnature  reserves,  just to name a few.  We need  to  consider\r\n\r\ncarefully  what  we  need  to  have  physically  within   the\r\n\r\ngeographical  limits of Singapore, and  what  we  can  access\r\n\r\noutside Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that for some non-essential items, we should look\r\n\r\nbeyond  Singapore's physical land mass.  For example, we  can\r\n\r\nlook  to  our  neighbouring countries   -  Johor,  Batam  and\r\n\r\nBintan,  to supply the space for more golf courses and  theme\r\n\r\nparks.   Some expert studies have concluded that for  such  a\r\n\r\nsmall population, we are over saturated with theme parks.   I\r\n\r\nam  sure  land  used  for the Tang Dynasty  Village  and  the\r\n\r\nSentosa Asian Village can be put to better use.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for golf, it is simply not justifiable for more\r\n\r\ncourses to be built within our national boundaries, as  there\r\n\r\nare  already so many courses in neighbouring Johor.   Golfers\r\n\r\nnow complain about the inconvenience of driving to Johor, but\r\n\r\nI  think  this problem can be solved.  When the Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  of  Malaysia, Mr Abdullah Badawi, visited  us  last\r\n\r\nmonth,  he  mentioned  plans for  a  smart  card  system  for\r\n\r\nfrequent travellers between Singapore and Johor, to ease  the\r\n\r\ncongestion  and  waiting time at the checkpoints.   With  the\r\n\r\neasing of travel controls to Malaysia, I believe that it  can\r\n\r\nbe  quite  an attractive alternative to golfing in Singapore.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the  abundance  of land,  Malaysia  offers  more\r\n\r\nrecreational  activities to Singaporeans  at  a  lower  cost.\r\n\r\nMalaysian green fees, for example, are only half or  a  third\r\n\r\nof  that  of  Singapore's, and club memberships  are  only  a\r\n\r\nfraction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the density of our housing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the planning scenario is  to accommodate 5.5 million\r\n\r\npersons in year X, ie, sometime in the future, it seems  that\r\n\r\nin  the  present  areas under development, our  planners  are\r\n\r\nalready planning and building to cater for an overall density\r\n\r\ncorresponding  to  a population of 5.5 million  people.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  in Sengkang and Punggol new towns, HDB  is  packing\r\n\r\nthe  flats  very densely and tightly in a small  area.   They\r\n\r\nbuild  many flats within a limited specific area,  and  leave\r\n\r\nhuge   tracts  of  land  untouched  and  undeveloped.    This\r\n\r\nprinciple  is  also  adopted  by  the  Focus  Group  on  Land\r\n\r\nAllocation in formulating its recommendations. In its report,\r\n\r\nit  is  said  that  \"given limited land,  future  development\r\n\r\nshould  start with looking at already developed  areas.   All\r\n\r\nareas  that  are  presently  sub-optimally  used  should   be\r\n\r\nidentified.   Land  development agencies should  aggressively\r\n\r\ninitiate  programmes to upgrade and redevelop such  areas  to\r\n\r\nhigher  intensity  before proceeding to open  new  areas  for\r\n\r\ndevelopment.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the argument seems to be that we have to pack the\r\n\r\nflats  more densely so as to leave other areas to build  more\r\n\r\nflats in future in anticipation of the time when we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhave  5.5 million people.  The fear is that if we build  less\r\n\r\n\"densely\" now, we will not be able to accommodate all the 5.5\r\n\r\nmillion people in time to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of this has been that HDB estates are more\r\n\r\ncrowded now.  There is less space in between blocks of flats,\r\n\r\nand  dwelling  units are smaller.  People suffer  being  more\r\n\r\ntightly  packed while we wait for the balance of 1.5  million\r\n\r\npeople to arrive in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree with this approach. On one border of my\r\n\r\nconstituency,  I  have  a large piece of  vacant  undeveloped\r\n\r\nland.   It  benefits the relatively small number of residents\r\n\r\nwhose  flats face this so-called wilderness by offering  them\r\n\r\nan  unobstructed view of greenery.  Even then, I  think  only\r\n\r\nthe  higher floor residents get the chance to appreciate  the\r\n\r\nlovely   view.   Lower  floor  residents  certainly  do   not\r\n\r\nappreciate  the bites they get from mosquitoes bred  in  that\r\n\r\nvacant  land.  Such a valuable piece of land, yet it  is  not\r\n\r\nput  to good use.  Only recently, one section of the land was\r\n\r\nopen  for  mountain biking.  Otherwise, it was off limits  to\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest an alternative principle.\r\n\r\nInstead of building so compactly, let us be a little bit more\r\n\r\n\"extravagant\".  We have not reached 5.5 million yet,  and  we\r\n\r\ndo not have to cram everybody in now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons why I say this. First, we must\r\n\r\nnot have the mindset that just because we erect buildings  on\r\n\r\na  piece  of  land to a certain gross plot  ratio  (GPR),  we\r\n\r\ncannot  increase the GPR in subsequent years.  It is  not  as\r\n\r\nrigid  as  that.   Market forces can be  put  to  work.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  when  the  URA revised the  plot  ratio  and  DGP,\r\n\r\ndevelopers and property owners jumped in, and older apartment\r\n\r\nblocks  were sold en bloc for redevelopment.  Some  of  these\r\n\r\nbuildings  sold  en bloc were less than 15  years  old.   For\r\n\r\npublic  housing  estates, I am sure the HDB  will  carry  out\r\n\r\nquite  a  bit  of redevelopment under the Selective  En  Bloc\r\n\r\nRedevelopment Scheme (SERS) in the next 30-40 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if we build buildings with more reserved sites\r\n\r\nin between now,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthese  spaces  can  be filled in later years.   For  example,\r\n\r\nTampines  Neighbourhood 4, in recent years, a  park,  an  old\r\n\r\nfolks  home  and a church centre have been built on  reserved\r\n\r\nsites.   Buildings can be clustered together  but  with  open\r\n\r\nspaces  in  between.  Residents do not mind  being  a  little\r\n\r\ncrammed provided there are open spaces, parks and playgrounds\r\n\r\nfor  them  and  their  family to go to relax  and  enjoy.   I\r\n\r\nbelieve with a combination of clustering buildings and nearby\r\n\r\nopen  spaces  in  between,  residents  will  understand   the\r\n\r\nconstraints  of building close-knit structures.   But  if  we\r\n\r\ncram everybody without nearby open spaces, I think this makes\r\n\r\neveryday living that much more stressful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is that we have to be careful in\r\n\r\nproviding   for   mixed  use  developments  and   in   having\r\n\r\nresidential  units  in the vicinity of commercial  areas.   I\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  Focus  Group that more  housing  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided  in the central area to rejuvenate it.  But  let  us\r\n\r\nlearn  from the experience of Lucky Plaza.  This building  is\r\n\r\nsituated along the popular Orchard Road, near Mount Elizabeth\r\n\r\nHospital.   It has a podium of commercial shops and  a  tower\r\n\r\nblock   of  residential  units.   Humans  being  human,   and\r\n\r\ncommercial space being more valuable than residential  space,\r\n\r\nwhat  happens is that the apartments in the tower  block  are\r\n\r\noften  used  as  offices, warehouses to store goods  for  the\r\n\r\nshops  below  and  as hostels for long-term patients  of  the\r\n\r\nhospital.  This is undesirable living environment.  Who wants\r\n\r\nto  live  in  an apartment with a warehouse on  one  side,  a\r\n\r\nhostel  on  the  other,  and  an  office  opposite?   Such  a\r\n\r\nsituation  does occur in a number of multi-purpose  mixed-use\r\n\r\ndevelopments,  and measures should be taken to  prevent  them\r\n\r\nfrom being more widespread.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakaruppan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakaruppan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, first, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  commend the Minister for his  initiative  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  the Concept Plan using a bottoms up approach,  where\r\n\r\nprofessionals to grassroots leaders have had the  opportunity\r\n\r\nto  air their aspirations, opinions and suggestions on how to\r\n\r\nshape Singapore's physical and living environment.  While I\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nagree  with  the  number  of recommendations  of  both  focus\r\n\r\ngroups,  I  would  like to nevertheless  comment  on  several\r\n\r\nareas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, housing space. One recommendation is to increase\r\n\r\nthe  gross plot ratio to up to 8 for housing in downtown, and\r\n\r\nthey  call  it  Manhattan style.   At the same  time,  it  is\r\n\r\nrecommended that the gross floor area per person should  also\r\n\r\nbe  increased,  despite  the  fact  that  household  size  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  has reduced from 4 to 3.  The experience  of  Hong\r\n\r\nKong is that while they have increased their gross plot ratio\r\n\r\nsignificantly in public and sandwich housing, the gross floor\r\n\r\narea  per person is indeed very much smaller than the present\r\n\r\nSingapore public housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not sure if the gross plot ratio should be\r\n\r\nincreased to 8 in downtown and to 3.65 for State land outside\r\n\r\nthe  central area.  While this will optimise land use, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand, it will create other problems like huge  traffic\r\n\r\ncongestions  in these areas.  Sir, I would like to  seek  the\r\n\r\nMinister's  response  to this recommendation  on  gross  plot\r\n\r\nratio.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus group has also recommended that we\r\n\r\nmaintain  only  7% of low density housing up  to  18%  medium\r\n\r\ndensity  housing.  Given young Singaporeans'  aspirations  to\r\n\r\nown  a condominium or a landed property, I wonder whether the\r\n\r\n7% for low density housing needs to be increased to, say, 10%\r\n\r\nover  the medium term of the next 10-15 years.  I also  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister what percentage of the population he\r\n\r\nexpects to live in public housing in the medium term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, next on the work space. The Government seems to\r\n\r\nhave often approached public housing building programmes very\r\n\r\nmuch  from a supply point of view, rather than from a  demand\r\n\r\npoint of view.  If more attention is paid to this, I am  sure\r\n\r\nmany  in  the workforce will find it convenient to stay  near\r\n\r\nwhere they work and find many other conveniences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the focus group has asked for more housing,\r\n\r\nparticularly  public  housing, to  be  built  in  areas  with\r\n\r\nemployment opportunities, especially in the central area and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  west region.  I think the Government must seriously look\r\n\r\ninto  this,  as  this will have a big impact on  the  working\r\n\r\npopulation  so that they can reduce their commuting  time  to\r\n\r\nand  from  work,  and there will be an overall  reduction  in\r\n\r\ntraffic  congestions as well as they would be  able  to  save\r\n\r\nmoney and their transport cost.\r\n\r\n<br>5.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the 1991 Concept Plan has recommended the\r\n\r\ndecentralisation of commercial centres.  The focus group  has\r\n\r\nhowever  asked  for a review of the number  of  locations  of\r\n\r\nregional  centres.  I call for a reduction in the  number  of\r\n\r\nthese  locations of regional centres.  Many  of  us  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  are  aware  of the problems faced by  our  HDB  retail\r\n\r\nshops.   Neighbourhood  centres and  bigger  shopping  retail\r\n\r\noutlets compete with the HDB retail shops and target the same\r\n\r\ncustomers  who  are  limited by  the  size  of  the  regional\r\n\r\nneighbourhood.  I think it is very urgent that the Government\r\n\r\nlooks into this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would talk about green space. There has been\r\n\r\nmuch  public debate in the media especially on whether  there\r\n\r\nshould  be  more parks or more golf courses built.   Sir,  my\r\n\r\nresponse  is that we should carefully evaluate the  need  for\r\n\r\nboth  of  these demands.  Personally, although I am  an  avid\r\n\r\ngolfer, I feel that we should not build any more golf courses\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  as  the demands increase in  future.   Because\r\n\r\nthese demands, as Mr Ong Kian Min has pointed out, can be met\r\n\r\nfrom cheaper golf courses in our neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for parks, we should recognise that many of our parks\r\n\r\nare  under-utilised.  For example, I understand from  the  MP\r\n\r\nlooking  after  the  Jurong area that the  Japanese  and  the\r\n\r\nChinese  Gardens are grossly under-utilised.  Therefore,  the\r\n\r\nprovision  of  0.8  hectares per  thousand  persons  must  be\r\n\r\ncarefully evaluated and reviewed so that precious land can be\r\n\r\nused for housing or industrial use.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, on the other focus group. It has focused on\r\n\r\nidentity and has made a strong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncase for preserving our heritage and developing a distinctive\r\n\r\nidentity.   In  this regard, I would like to just  point  out\r\n\r\nthat we must try and find ways to reduce the social divide of\r\n\r\nresidents  living  in our HDB estates.  Unwittingly,  we  may\r\n\r\nhave  developed a class system in our HDB estates.  We  often\r\n\r\ncategorise different households by 1-room, 2-room, 3-room, 4-room or 5-roomers.  We have entrenched this by using this  to\r\n\r\nhand  out goodies during budgets and for off-budget measures.\r\n\r\nPeople  do not like this branding.  I hope that, as  part  of\r\n\r\nthis  Concept Plan review, the Minister will look  into  this\r\n\r\nmatter,  which  is  a stigma amongst many lower  and  middle-income Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> I would like to\r\n\r\njoin my colleagues in commending the Ministry for its Concept\r\n\r\nPlan 21 initiative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has been successful in getting wide-ranging\r\n\r\nviews  and  suggestions from all segments of society  through\r\n\r\nits  two  focus  groups and the public forum organised.   The\r\n\r\ndiscussions  and debates have been so comprehensive  that  we\r\n\r\nwould  be hard put to offer new ideas today.  What I am going\r\n\r\nto  say  today  would be more an expression of my  views  and\r\n\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we all agree that we have to better intensify\r\n\r\nthe use of land for housing, commercial and industrial needs,\r\n\r\nif  we  want to support a larger population.  The density  of\r\n\r\nplot  ratio  we  can go up to will depend on the  height  and\r\n\r\nother  constraints.  I would like to make a special call  for\r\n\r\ngreater density in the prime housing areas, especially within\r\n\r\nthe  CBD.  We should build higher so that more of our younger\r\n\r\npopulation can live in the prime areas and help to bring more\r\n\r\nlife   and  vibrancy  to  the  city.   We  should  have  more\r\n\r\nresidential  developments mixed with commercial  developments\r\n\r\nso  that  our  downtown would not be dead at  night,  as  has\r\n\r\nhappened  in Shenton Way, Raffles Place and the Marina  area.\r\n\r\nThe  Marina  area  is  less  so because  of  the  hotels  and\r\n\r\nrestaurants  we have in the area.  This move  would  help  to\r\n\r\nbetter\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nutilise  the facilities and other infrastructure in  downtown\r\n\r\nbuilt  at  great expense.  It would help to boost the  retail\r\n\r\nand restaurant sectors of our economy that currently is still\r\n\r\ntoo much centred around Orchard Road area at night.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orchard Road area is so successful, in my view, because\r\n\r\nof   the  high  number  of  high-rise  condominiums  in   the\r\n\r\nsurrounding   areas  of  Cairnhill,  River  Valley,   Orchard\r\n\r\nBoulevard, Stevens Road, and so on.  In Marina South where we\r\n\r\nare  planning a new downtown, I hope the Government will have\r\n\r\nenough   high-rise   residential  developments   mixed   with\r\n\r\ncommercial ones to bring life there at night, so as to  bring\r\n\r\ngreater value to these properties built on land reclaimed  at\r\n\r\ngreat expense.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next issue which has been brought up by my\r\n\r\ncolleague,  Dr  Teo, is regarding the possible relocation  of\r\n\r\none  of the airports to the southern islands.  I support  his\r\n\r\ncall.   I  think  if  we need to reclaim  land  to  join  the\r\n\r\nislands,  if necessary, we should try to do so.   This  would\r\n\r\nfree up a lot of land for other uses on the mainland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has the Government considered leasing on a long-term\r\n\r\nbasis  some  small islands from our neighbours for industrial\r\n\r\nand  recreational uses?   That is something that I  hope  the\r\n\r\nGovernment can look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building to high density will obviously bring about\r\n\r\ngreater  congestion on our roads.  We should try and  promote\r\n\r\nmore  walking  and  cycling, especially in the  new  downtown\r\n\r\nareas,  with  more  connecting paths and walkways.   Some  of\r\n\r\nthese  can  be  built underground or overhead.  Walkways  for\r\n\r\npedestrians should be covered, if possible.  Island-wide,  we\r\n\r\nshould  build more cycling paths to connect all parks in  the\r\n\r\nisland.   This  would  help to promote a healthier  lifestyle\r\n\r\ntoo.  Netherlands is an excellent example for us to follow in\r\n\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reviewing the Concept Plan, like, for example, in\r\n\r\n1991,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  whether  we  have\r\n\r\nreduced plot ratios in certain areas downwards.  If so,  have\r\n\r\nwe  ascertained how the reduction in plot areas has  impacted\r\n\r\nthe owners of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsuch land financially?  Do we compensate them in the same way\r\n\r\nthat  we ask for development charges for raising plot ratios?\r\n\r\nFor  Concept Plan 21, do we anticipate that we might need  to\r\n\r\nreduce  plot  ratios  in  some  areas?   If  so,  would   the\r\n\r\nGovernment compensate those owners affected?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, it was my privilege to serve as one\r\n\r\nof  the co-chairs of the two focus groups to the Concept Plan\r\n\r\nthat the members before me have mentioned.  I, first, want to\r\n\r\nstart  by  commending the Ministry for listening  to  people.\r\n\r\nSome  of  you  may recollect that I engaged the Minister  and\r\n\r\nquestioned his Ministry about consultation over the issue  of\r\n\r\nthe National Library building.  And he took us up on that and\r\n\r\nhe  created  a  structure that tried to  reach  out  to  both\r\n\r\ngrassroots as well as to experts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the many points raised by the two reports, I want to\r\n\r\nonly  share  my  hopes on one, and this is on  the  issue  of\r\n\r\nconservation of nature and built heritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the greenery and conserved buildings are sometimes\r\n\r\nviewed  as  marginal interests only, and the belief  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  only  a few Singaporeans who are  interested  in.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I think the Concept Plan Focus Group challenged  us\r\n\r\nto   see   its   connection  to  -  the  vital  question   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans' identity which is debated many times.  Clearly,\r\n\r\nthey  found that it is not so that these issues are marginal.\r\n\r\nRather, both grassroots leaders, professionals and all  those\r\n\r\nwe  spoke to were unanimous in supporting the conservation of\r\n\r\nboth  nature  and built heritage.  Public feedback  has  been\r\n\r\nlargely supportive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite surprised to hear that even avid golfers,\r\n\r\nlike  Mr Sinnakaruppan, say that they were supportive of  the\r\n\r\nidea  that there should be no more golf courses.   Why?   Not\r\n\r\nbecause suddenly they become anti-golf, but because there  is\r\n\r\na   recognition  that  our  built  national  heritage   makes\r\n\r\nSingapore  distinctive  and  anchors  our  self-identity  and\r\n\r\nbelonging to this place.  Our Garden City concept,  the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  we are an island, all this appeals to both citizens  as\r\n\r\nwell as foreigners who\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvisit,  work and stay here.  Obviously, we have to  make  the\r\n\r\nchoices of what we conserve.  So many of the speakers  before\r\n\r\nme  have  emphasised  other needs too.   We  cannot  conserve\r\n\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Singaporeans, as a whole, have a good sense to\r\n\r\nrecognise there are trade-offs that are going to be necessary\r\n\r\nover time between conservation and economic development.  But\r\n\r\nalmost  all felt that more can and should be conserved.   Not\r\n\r\njust  the  famous national heritage like the Padang,  Istana,\r\n\r\nthe  Old Parliament Building, but also regional landmarks  in\r\n\r\ndifferent  areas  of  Singapore, and  everyday  places  where\r\n\r\npeople  congregate to eat, work and play.  Not just  colonial\r\n\r\nbuildings, but also aspects of post-World World II Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I think that we need to think more about how\r\n\r\nwe  conserve,  because  conservation is  not  a  question  of\r\n\r\nfreezing  things  and time.  It is not  a  museum  idea.   We\r\n\r\nshould  allow  sensitive  redevelopment  while  ensuring  the\r\n\r\ncultures  and  lifestyles  are  considered  alongside   urban\r\n\r\ndesign.   Katong was picked up as an example by the group  of\r\n\r\nan  area of living interest and innovative re-use can also be\r\n\r\nencouraged.   As  we  see the change of life  along  Waterloo\r\n\r\nStreet, I am not sure you can eat Indian rojak there anymore,\r\n\r\nbut  art  groups  flourish  there and  life  has  come  back.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, on a slightly higher scale, you have the Far  East\r\n\r\nSquare and the hotel at Fullerton.  Diversity and uniqueness,\r\n\r\nin  a  sense,  Sir,  should be strongly  encouraged  for  the\r\n\r\nConcept Plan.  For this, both environmental and social impact\r\n\r\nshould be assessed carefully before decisions are made.  This\r\n\r\nbrings  me  to  my  most important point, which  I  hope  the\r\n\r\nMinistry will consider.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who will conserve? Who will assess? Who will take part\r\n\r\nin  the  process?  At present, Sir, decisions are made almost\r\n\r\nsolely  by Government.  I mention these focus groups  because\r\n\r\nthey  are  one  of  the first structured steps  in  involving\r\n\r\ncitizens more.  I hope the Ministry will continue to  involve\r\n\r\ncitizens in these issues.  More than\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat,  a  very  strong suggestion by the  groups  was  for  a\r\n\r\nHeritage  Conservation Trust.  It is hoped that a new  entity\r\n\r\nwill   be   created  that  improves  transparency,  increases\r\n\r\naccountability  and involves the public more  in  development\r\n\r\nplanning,  and that this Trust should stand both  independent\r\n\r\nand equal to the relevant Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will share his response to this\r\n\r\nsuggestion, as well as to many of the issues raised  here  in\r\n\r\nthe House and in the report.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, as far as I\r\n\r\nknow,  most  of  our golf courses are sited in the  catchment\r\n\r\narea  or  under flight path.  These are areas which  are  not\r\n\r\nsuitable  for  housing.  So if we need one more such  course,\r\n\r\nespecially for our NSmen, and if such land is available,  why\r\n\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me focus on one of the focus groups'\r\n\r\nrecommendations.  One of the groups in its report states that\r\n\r\nthe  group  in  formulating  its  recommendations  took  into\r\n\r\naccount  optimised  infrastructure.  It says,  and  I  quote:\r\n\r\n\"There  has been heavy investment in infrastructure  such  as\r\n\r\nexpressways,  MRT and utility installations.   The  level  of\r\n\r\nintensity  of  development  in  the  areas  served  by  these\r\n\r\ninstallations should be raised to be commensurate with  their\r\n\r\ncarrying  capacity  and  respective capital  investment.\"   I\r\n\r\nthink this is a sound principle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completion of the North-East MRT line very soon and\r\n\r\nthe  planned development of several other lines and LRT  will\r\n\r\ndrastically  change the landscape as well as  impact  on  the\r\n\r\nland use along this line.  I think it is very timely that the\r\n\r\nold Concept Plan should be reviewed, and also the Development\r\n\r\nGuide   Plans.   This  new  infrastructure  development   has\r\n\r\ncertainly rendered certain DGPs outdated.  A case in point is\r\n\r\nthe  DGP  for  Serangoon  area.  Under  this  particular  DGP\r\n\r\ngazetted several years ago, one particular area next  to  the\r\n\r\nLorong  Lew  Lian HDB housing estate, on one  side  of  Upper\r\n\r\nSerangoon Road was designated as low rise housing, despite\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  fact  that  there  are existing  two  10-storey  private\r\n\r\napartments  called the Jade Tower.  This particular  area  is\r\n\r\nnow less than 200 metres from the Serangoon MRT Station.   On\r\n\r\nthe  other side of the road, however, the three-storey Farrer\r\n\r\nHeights  CC was asked to move because it has got a  very  low\r\n\r\nplot ratio.  The low plot ratio allowed for this area is such\r\n\r\nthat  the two existing blocks of 10-storey private apartments\r\n\r\nhave to actually go down to four storeys, if they were to  be\r\n\r\nredeveloped.\r\n\r\n<br>5.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds contradictory and inconsistent. We know for\r\n\r\na  fact  that  many  of the landed properties  adjoining  the\r\n\r\nvarious  MRT  stations of the North-East line  were  actually\r\n\r\nacquired and big sums of money paid to the owners.  The worst\r\n\r\nthing about this DGP is that it gives no incentive for owners\r\n\r\nof  the two blocks I mentioned, for example, which are  about\r\n\r\n20 years old to redevelop.  So there is no incentive for them\r\n\r\nto   redevelop.   I  would  therefore  like  to   take   this\r\n\r\nopportunity  to urge the Minister to review and  revise  this\r\n\r\nparticular DGP and, perhaps, other similar DGPs with  a  view\r\n\r\nto  revise  the plot ratio upwards so as to provide  adequate\r\n\r\nincentives for them to be redeveloped.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, land use planning is actually a\r\n\r\nsophisticated piece of work which is done by urban  planners.\r\n\r\nFor  example, when an airport is being built, one makes  sure\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  nearby  areas,  residential  housing  is   not\r\n\r\nconstructed,  or  if  buildings  are  constructed,  high-rise\r\n\r\nbuildings  are  not  constructed because it  may  pose  noise\r\n\r\nhazards  to  the  residents who may subsequently  occupy  the\r\n\r\nplace.   For example, one does not locate housing next  to  a\r\n\r\nreservoir  because we do not want the water to  be  polluted.\r\n\r\nBut  being in the Jurong area, I was surprised that,  despite\r\n\r\nthis  land use planning guidelines, Jurong West Neighbourhood\r\n\r\n6,  which  is  a HDB housing estate, was built in  the  first\r\n\r\nplace  on  the  path of a RSAF airbase.  Not  only  was  this\r\n\r\nhousing  estate built, but the housing estate was built  with\r\n\r\nvery high rise blocks so much so that, as I have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstated  in  this  House  before, some  of  my  residents  can\r\n\r\nactually see the faces of the pilots.  So I would like to ask\r\n\r\nthe  Minister how come there was such an urban planning usage\r\n\r\nwhereby  a  housing estate was built on the  aircraft  flight\r\n\r\npath in the first place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue I would like to raise here is pertinent\r\n\r\nbecause  the Minister himself is the FAS Chairman.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister what is the norm for planning sports\r\n\r\nfacilities  in  HDB estates.  Because one of  the  sad  facts\r\n\r\nabout today's HDB estates is the lack of sports facilities in\r\n\r\nthe  housing  estates.  At most one sees in a precinct  is  a\r\n\r\nbasketball court or a sepak takraw court.  And I  am  one  of\r\n\r\nthose  who  believe  that if we want to  integrate  and  bond\r\n\r\npeople  at  the  local level, which is  at  the  precinct  or\r\n\r\nconstituency level, we must provide sports facilities because\r\n\r\npeople  will  come  down  and participate.   They  will  make\r\n\r\nfriends and that will lead to the creation of bonding at  the\r\n\r\nlocal level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I have noticed is that, in my constituency,\r\n\r\nwhenever  there  is a vacant piece of land, I  will  tell  my\r\n\r\ngrassroots leaders to put up a goal post and let us see  what\r\n\r\nis the response.  And I notice that, on weekends, people will\r\n\r\nnaturally  come and play games.  This is the  way  we  create\r\n\r\nfriendship  and bonding at the local ground level.   Here,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  ask the Minister whether he could  seriously\r\n\r\nconsider what is the land use planning norms in each  of  the\r\n\r\nconstituencies as far as sports facilities are concerned.   I\r\n\r\nnotice  that  whenever  I ask civil  servants  where  do  the\r\n\r\nresidents  go,  they said if you want bigger facilities,  you\r\n\r\ncan  go  to the stadium.  But actually the stadiums  are  not\r\n\r\nquite  located in the best locations.  We cannot  expect  the\r\n\r\nresidents to go to the stadium to use facilities on  a  daily\r\n\r\nor  weekend basis.  In any event, what I have heard  is  that\r\n\r\nthere  are  complaints that there are not  enough  facilities\r\n\r\neven  in  the stadiums.  People have told me that  those  who\r\n\r\nwant to play badminton have to queue up on Monday morning and\r\n\r\nwithin   half  an  hour,  all  the  facilities  are   booked.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if those who want to play\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfootball, they do not want to go to a stadium where there are\r\n\r\ninadequate facilities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like to ask the Minister, when reconsidering\r\n\r\nthe  land use planning, whether we can see how we can develop\r\n\r\nbetter sports facilities at the constituency or even precinct\r\n\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau:</b> Government is the largest land owner in\r\n\r\nSingapore.   It  controls  the supply  of  land  and  housing\r\n\r\nthrough its land sales programme, zoning and plot ratios.  It\r\n\r\nestimates  the  demand for land and puts  up  land  for  sale\r\n\r\naccordingly.   It  determines the price  indirectly  and  can\r\n\r\ndecide  whether  to  award  or  not  to  award  the  tenders,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  the price.  In cases when tender  prices  were\r\n\r\nconsidered below market value, tenders were not awarded.   My\r\n\r\nquestion to the Minister is: how does the URA decide what the\r\n\r\nmarket  prices  should be?  Is it not  the  slate  of  latest\r\n\r\ntender  prices reflective of the latest market  price  unless\r\n\r\nthere is collusion among the tenderers?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bids are high, sometimes even twice the\r\n\r\nexpected market value, the Government always awards the sale.\r\n\r\nHowever,  when  the  bids are low, the  Government  sometimes\r\n\r\nwithholds the award of sale.  By so doing, the supply of land\r\n\r\nto the private developers will be curtailed and the prices of\r\n\r\nland  will be controlled.  This is unlike the sale  of  COEs,\r\n\r\nwhen  COEs have been sold for even as low as $1.   I  am  not\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that land be sold for as low as $1.  We  can  all\r\n\r\nbecome  property developers then.  What I want to ask  really\r\n\r\nand  to generate some discussion on is why should there be  a\r\n\r\ndifference  in  the  two  assets  put  up  for  sale  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. Both are assets with market values and  they  can\r\n\r\nbe financed by the banks and other financial institutions.  I\r\n\r\nwould like the Minister to comment on this.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Sir, first of all, let me respond to all the Members who have\r\n\r\nspoken on the Concept Plan Review.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Concept Plan is an important document, as Dr\r\n\r\nTeo  Ho  Pin  has  mentioned just  now.   It  determines  our\r\n\r\nphysical  landscape and it guides the way we  wish  to  live,\r\n\r\nwork  and play in the decades ahead.  The first Concept  Plan\r\n\r\nwas prepared in 1971 by UN experts.  The emphasis then was on\r\n\r\nbasic  housing and, out of that 1971 plan, arose the building\r\n\r\nof  HDB  flats around the central catchment area.  This  sets\r\n\r\nthe  tone  and the framework for the development  of  housing\r\n\r\nestates in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1981 and 1991, the plan was reviewed. So every 10\r\n\r\nyears,  there is a review and this time, the emphasis shifted\r\n\r\nfrom basic housing and basic infrastructure to enhancing  the\r\n\r\nquality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2001 review seeks to update the plan taking into\r\n\r\naccount  the  changing needs and aspirations of  our  people,\r\n\r\nboth  quantitative as well as qualitative.  The Concept  Plan\r\n\r\nis  not just about creating a world-class city.  It is  about\r\n\r\nbuilding  a home for Singaporeans, a home we can be proud  to\r\n\r\ncall our own, a home to bring up family.  And this is why  it\r\n\r\nwas important to involve the public in the preparation of the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan.   First  of all, if this  is  going  to  be  a\r\n\r\nblueprint for our home, then all of us who have a stake  here\r\n\r\nought  to  have a say in how we want this place  to  develop.\r\n\r\nAnd  second, the more we are involved in the planning, we are\r\n\r\nbetter informed and aware of the constraints we face and  the\r\n\r\ntradeoffs  needed to make this place, this  little  red  dot,\r\n\r\ncomfortable and livable for us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach out to as many people as possible from\r\n\r\ndifferent  walks  of life, URA formed two focus  groups.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  URA  opened  up many feedback  channels,  such  as\r\n\r\nInternet,  through  public  forums,  letters  to  the  press,\r\n\r\ntelephone calls, and so on, in order to draw in as much views\r\n\r\nand ideas as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must say that I was greatly encouraged by the\r\n\r\nresponse  to  our  efforts  in  the  volumes  of  suggestions\r\n\r\nreceived  as  well as in the depth and the breadth  of  these\r\n\r\nsuggestions.  I would like to acknowledge, in particular, the\r\n\r\nhard work and dedication of the focus group\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmembers,  ably  led  by their Chairman, Assoc.  Prof.  Vivian\r\n\r\nBalakrishnan, Mr Tham Tuck Cheong, Mr Philip Ng and Mr  Simon\r\n\r\nTay and all those whom they co-opted into their discussions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public consultation process has been of great value\r\n\r\nto  our  planners.   It has given them  plenty  of  food  for\r\n\r\nthought.   It  has  also  given them a  better  feel  of  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  pulse,  about  how strongly  people  feel  about\r\n\r\nissues,  such  as conservation and identity.   On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  I  am told that many focus group members emerged  from\r\n\r\nthe discussions with a better appreciation of our constraints\r\n\r\nand  competing needs in planning for the future.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthis has been a most valuable experience for all involved.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two focus groups, one on land allocation, and the other\r\n\r\none on identity, submitted their final reports to my Ministry\r\n\r\nlast month.  URA and the relevant Government agencies are now\r\n\r\nstudying in detail the focus groups' findings as well as  the\r\n\r\npublic  feedback received.  They will give these  suggestions\r\n\r\nserious  consideration and, where possible, incorporate  them\r\n\r\ninto the draft Concept Plan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now present some of our preliminary thinking on\r\n\r\nthe  key findings of the focus groups and address the  issues\r\n\r\nraised  by  several Members on the Concept  Plan.   Sir,  the\r\n\r\nstarting point for the Concept Plan is population size.   For\r\n\r\nthis  review, a multi-agency study group which included  URA,\r\n\r\nof  course,  and  HDB,  the Department  of  Statistics,  MTI,\r\n\r\nMinistry   of  Manpower,  Ministry  of  Health,  proposed   a\r\n\r\npopulation figure of 5.5 million as a planning parameter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that this figure is not a population\r\n\r\ntarget.  It is not a target that the Government will set  out\r\n\r\nto  achieve or has to achieve.  It is a projection  based  on\r\n\r\nforeseeable  trends  in  economic  growth,  fertility  rates,\r\n\r\nmigration  rates,  etc.  It is a reasonable  assumption  upon\r\n\r\nwhich to base our physical development over the next 40 to 50\r\n\r\nyears.  40 to 50 years is a very long time.  Projections  may\r\n\r\nbe wrong.  In fact, when we did the 1991 Concept Plan,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwe  were  looking at a population figure of 4 million.   But,\r\n\r\nnevertheless,  this is a best estimate of what  a  population\r\n\r\nfigure could be in 40 to 50 years' time.  And we will have  a\r\n\r\nrough  idea in 10 years, when the next review of the plan  is\r\n\r\ncarried out, whether we are on the right track.  So,  in  the\r\n\r\nmeantime,  we  make use of this figure of  5.5  million.   We\r\n\r\nasked  our planners what if we have a 5.5 million population?\r\n\r\nHow  should we cater to our future social and economic needs,\r\n\r\ngiven the constraints that we face, particularly in terms  of\r\n\r\nland?\r\n\r\n<br>5.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first question we need to consider, when talking\r\n\r\nabout  a  larger  population, is how do we balance  competing\r\n\r\nland  needs.   The focus group on land allocation  looked  at\r\n\r\nland for major uses like housing, industries and recreational\r\n\r\nspace.  One suggestion was to increase the average plot ratio\r\n\r\nfor  high-density housing, from a figure of 2.5 today, to  an\r\n\r\naverage  of  3.65.  What does \"3.65\" mean?  Just  to  give  a\r\n\r\nrough idea: this means that housing estates could be as dense\r\n\r\nas  some  of  the  newer estates that we see today,  such  as\r\n\r\nSengkang.  Of course, the older estates like Bedok, Toa Payoh\r\n\r\nand  Ang  Mo Kio have a much lower plot ratio.  The  question\r\n\r\nis:  would this more crowded environment be acceptable to our\r\n\r\npeople?  Mr Ong Kian Min, in fact, expressed his reservations\r\n\r\nthat this is indeed the right way to go.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the focus group's consultations with the\r\n\r\npublic,  it appears that Singaporeans are prepared to  accept\r\n\r\nsuch  higher  densities.  We will need to study  whether  the\r\n\r\naverage  plot  ratios proposed, like 3.65,  can  in  fact  be\r\n\r\nachieved,  given some of the constraints that  we  face,  eg,\r\n\r\nheight  constraints from flight paths, etc.  But I  think  it\r\n\r\nmakes  sense  to  have  higher density housing  developments,\r\n\r\nespecially  in areas near MRT stations, so that  more  people\r\n\r\ncan  enjoy the convenience of the MRT.  In areas where  there\r\n\r\nare  height  constraints,  more flexible  guidelines  can  be\r\n\r\nconsidered to achieve the higher density and, in the process,\r\n\r\nalso to encourage more innovative housing forms.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Ong that there is really no need to\r\n\r\nincrease our housing density overnight, as it were.   It  can\r\n\r\nbe  done in tandem with population growth.  The Concept Plan,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, is a long-range plan, and it is prepared  for  a\r\n\r\nscenario 40 to 50 years down the road, which is a long  time.\r\n\r\nSo  it is likely that the increase in housing density will be\r\n\r\nincremental and will be realised only over a period of time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau spoke about more intensive housing\r\n\r\ndensity  in  the CBD and in the new downtown.  In his  words,\r\n\r\nthis  would make sure that the downtown would not be dead  at\r\n\r\nnight.   The focus group has a similar proposal to have  more\r\n\r\nresidential  developments  in  the  central  area.   It   has\r\n\r\nsuggested  high-rise  Manhattan-style housing,  with  a  high\r\n\r\naverage  plot ratio of 8, compared to the average plot  ratio\r\n\r\nof  5  that  the  planners had previously studied.   This  is\r\n\r\nphysically possible, because the new downtown is not  subject\r\n\r\nto  the severe height constraints that other areas are.  But,\r\n\r\nas  Members have also pointed out, planners have to  consider\r\n\r\nthe  implications of such dense developments if we  apply  it\r\n\r\nacross  the  board, such as social and environmental  impact,\r\n\r\ntraffic congestion and so on.  I want to stress that whatever\r\n\r\nthe  final  adopted  average plot ratio,  our  planners  will\r\n\r\nensure  that  high-rise housing means good  quality  housing,\r\n\r\nwith  enough  green relief, communal space,  amenities,  good\r\n\r\nestate layouts, building designs and so on, all to make  sure\r\n\r\nthat we have quality housing for our people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turn now to some comments made about HDB estates.\r\n\r\nIndeed, some HDB flat applicants have told us that they would\r\n\r\nlike  their  new homes in existing areas, because this  would\r\n\r\nallow them to live closer to their families and also to enjoy\r\n\r\nsome of the established amenities there.  This is in fact the\r\n\r\nproblem  with some of our new estates, because we are rolling\r\n\r\nout the facilities as the residents move in.  And where there\r\n\r\nis  a  problem of timing or coordination of these  amenities,\r\n\r\ninconveniences  arise, and some Members of  this  House  have\r\n\r\nraised these issues here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus groups have also commented that the continuous\r\n\r\ncreation  of  new  HDB  towns and the  resulting  outflow  of\r\n\r\nyounger  residents  and  upgraders have  resulted  in  people\r\n\r\nlosing  a  sense  of identification with the towns,  and  one\r\n\r\nsuggestion  was  to  build  new  higher  density  housing  in\r\n\r\nestablished  housing estates.  I think these  proposals  make\r\n\r\ngood  sense,  both economically and socially.   Economically,\r\n\r\nbecause  we  can capitalise on existing infrastructure.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  if we were to increase the capacity and density  in\r\n\r\nsome  of  the older estates where infrastructure  is  already\r\n\r\nestablished,  then not only would it be more  convenient  for\r\n\r\nthose residents who move in, we would not need to spend large\r\n\r\nsums  of money to open up new towns.  And, socially,  we  can\r\n\r\nbenefit because building within the existing new towns  means\r\n\r\nthat  people would be able to live nearer their families and,\r\n\r\nas a result, foster closer family and community ties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Teo Ho Pin and Mr Sinnakaruppan touched on the\r\n\r\nissue of housing mix, in terms of density of housing as  well\r\n\r\nas ownership, ie, whether it is private or public.  I want to\r\n\r\nsay  here that we would like to maintain a variety of housing\r\n\r\ntypes, ie, low, medium as well as high-rise housing, to  make\r\n\r\nsure  that Singaporeans continue to have choices in the  type\r\n\r\nof  housing  that  they want to live  in.   The  focus  group\r\n\r\nproposed  a  mix  of 8% low, 15% medium and 77%  high-density\r\n\r\nhousing.   This is close to the density mix today.   But  the\r\n\r\npercentage of high-density housing would be higher  than  the\r\n\r\n70%  proposed in the 1991 Concept Plan.  A higher  proportion\r\n\r\nof  high-density housing is logical, if we are talking  about\r\n\r\nintensifying the use of housing land.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, when I spoke in this House, I said that for\r\n\r\nplanning  purposes,  we would adopt a 75%:25%  public-private\r\n\r\nhousing mix.  This mix was guided by what we thought would be\r\n\r\na  sustainable public housing programme, as well as  to  meet\r\n\r\nthe  aspirations  of  Singaporeans for private  housing.   In\r\n\r\n1990,  the public-private mix was 86% public and 14% private.\r\n\r\nIn  our effort to meet the aspirations of Singaporeans to own\r\n\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing,  the  Government has been steadily  releasing  sales\r\n\r\nsites for private housing development and, at the end of last\r\n\r\nyear,  the  housing mix stood at 81% public and 19%  private.\r\n\r\nIn  other words, more households now live in private housing.\r\n\r\nIn  the  medium to long term, we intend to stick to  a  75:25\r\n\r\npublic-private housing mix as a planning parameter.  However,\r\n\r\nwe   will   monitor  closely  the  housing   aspirations   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and adjust accordingly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to touch on the issue of industries and\r\n\r\ncommerce  at  this stage, for completeness.  The focus  group\r\n\r\nrecommended  that  we  also  increase  the  plot  ratio   for\r\n\r\ncommercial and industrial land.  For commercial land, this is\r\n\r\nnot  a problem, so long as the necessary infrastructure, like\r\n\r\ntransport  and utilities, is able to support such  increases.\r\n\r\nBut for industrial land, the dilemma is that many high value-added  industries, such as chemicals and life sciences,  need\r\n\r\nlow-rise  and  more  sprawling facilities.   They  cannot  be\r\n\r\naccommodated  in  multi-storey industrial  developments.   We\r\n\r\nhave  to  continue to attract these industries to our  shores\r\n\r\nbecause they bring tremendous economic spin-offs.  So we must\r\n\r\nfind room for them somehow, or our economy will suffer.   For\r\n\r\nsuch  industries which cannot go high-rise, the  focus  group\r\n\r\nrecommended using the airspace above these industries  so  as\r\n\r\nto optimise the land.  This is a novel suggestion and we will\r\n\r\nstudy it carefully.  For selected sites, eg, those nearer MRT\r\n\r\nstations,  intensification to the focus  group's  recommended\r\n\r\nGPR of 2.5, or even higher, could be achievable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sinnakaruppan asked how we could balance housing with\r\n\r\nworkplaces, in order to make sure that people do not have  to\r\n\r\ncommute  and therefore reduce traffic congestion.  The  focus\r\n\r\ngroup   made  a  similar  point  about  creating   a   better\r\n\r\ngeographical balance between resident and worker  population.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  will  try to do is to build more homes  near  major\r\n\r\nemployment  areas,  like the central  area  and  the  western\r\n\r\nregion.  Similarly, we will safeguard land for commercial and\r\n\r\nsuitable industrial developments in different regions near to\r\n\r\npopulation centres.  URA is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nadopting  this  approach in preparing the  Concept  Plan,  in\r\n\r\norder to reduce commuting and bring jobs closer to homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of parks and open spaces, which Mr\r\n\r\nSinnakaruppan also brought up, the focus group  supports  the\r\n\r\nplanners' target standard of 0.8 hectares per 1,000  persons,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  an  increase from the current  provision  of  0.67\r\n\r\nhectares per 1,000 persons.  On the ground, these figures  do\r\n\r\nnot mean very much.  What most people are concerned about  is\r\n\r\nwhether there is a park near to their home where they can  go\r\n\r\nto  relax and exercise.  So we should try to focus on quality\r\n\r\nrather  than  quantity, and provide more  quality  parks  and\r\n\r\ngreen spaces which would be accessible to more people.  Parts\r\n\r\nof  the central catchment which are not currently accessible,\r\n\r\ncould  be  opened  to  the public.  Where  we  can,  we  will\r\n\r\nintegrate   nature   areas   with  parks   and   recreational\r\n\r\nfacilities.   While  we  cannot keep  all  the  nature  areas\r\n\r\nidentified by the focus group, we will try to keep  them  for\r\n\r\nas  long  as  they  are  not required  for  development.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  we  will  take note of the unique  qualities  of\r\n\r\nPulau  Ubin and the special place it holds in the  hearts  of\r\n\r\nmany Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some members of the public have asked why can we not\r\n\r\nhave  even more green spaces and parks?  Can we not keep more\r\n\r\nnature  areas?   This  is a question of  trade-offs.   If  we\r\n\r\nchoose  to increase the land provided for parks, open  spaces\r\n\r\nand  nature areas substantially, it just means that  we  will\r\n\r\nhave  less  land  for housing, industries and businesses,  or\r\n\r\nhousing  will become even more dense and some industries  may\r\n\r\nhave to be squeezed out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew Syn Pau advocated having more cycling parks\r\n\r\nconnected  around the island, to promote cycling  for  health\r\n\r\nand  to  reduce traffic congestion.  In case Mr  Lew  is  not\r\n\r\naware,  cycling tracks have been incorporated into  our  park\r\n\r\nconnectors.  These park connectors are actually intended  for\r\n\r\nrecreational purposes, but there is no reason why they cannot\r\n\r\nbe  used  also  as  a means of getting from place  to  place.\r\n\r\nThese   park  connectors  link  major  parks,  nature  areas,\r\n\r\npopulation\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncentres,  as  well  as  coastal areas into  one  very  easily\r\n\r\naccessible  green  network.  So far,  16  stretches  of  park\r\n\r\nconnectors  have been built, and 18 more will be  built  over\r\n\r\nthe next four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one issue which has received particular attention\r\n\r\nduring  the  focus group's discussions and,  indeed,  amongst\r\n\r\nMembers  of this House as well, is the issue of golf courses.\r\n\r\nSir, here I must declare my interest that I am also a golfer,\r\n\r\nalbeit  a  very lousy one.  The focus group recommended  that\r\n\r\nthere  be  no  more new golf courses.  This has received  the\r\n\r\nsupport  of even avid golfers like Mr Sinnakaruppan, although\r\n\r\nother  equally avid golfers in this House have  stood  up  to\r\n\r\nchampion the cause of certain groups of golfers.  I will come\r\n\r\nto that later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planners have explained that most of our golf\r\n\r\ncourses  are located in constrained areas, as Mr Goh  rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out  - land within catchment areas or land  directly\r\n\r\nunder  flight paths.  So what else do you do with  the  land?\r\n\r\nBut some people have argued that we can actually use the land\r\n\r\nfor  parks,  why use it for golf courses?  Sir, I  understand\r\n\r\nthese  sentiments.   I  must point  out,  however,  that  the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan must cater to the different recreational  needs\r\n\r\nof  many  Singaporeans.  Golf is one such form of  recreation\r\n\r\nwhich  is  in  heavy demand.  For example, the SAFRA  Country\r\n\r\nClub  at  Tanah Merah has some 10,000 members, 8,000 of  them\r\n\r\nplay  regularly on its golf courses, and an additional  3,000\r\n\r\nnon-members use its courses, bringing the number  of  golfers\r\n\r\nat  Tanah  Merah SAFRA alone to some 11,000.  I  believe  the\r\n\r\nreason  why  the  SAFRA golf courses are crowded  is  because\r\n\r\nmembership  fees are cheaper than other courses.  The  issue,\r\n\r\ntherefore, is not just about the number of golf courses,  but\r\n\r\nwhether we can have golf courses that are more accessible  to\r\n\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n<br>6.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min suggested that Singaporeans make use of\r\n\r\ngolf courses in our neighbouring countries instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nIndeed, many Singaporeans have purchased golf memberships  in\r\n\r\nJohor,  Batam,  Bintan  and  they do  play  there  regularly.\r\n\r\nSingapore companies have also invested in golf courses there.\r\n\r\nThis  is certainly a win-win situation for Singapore as  well\r\n\r\nas  for  our neighbours, and it should be encouraged.   To  a\r\n\r\ncertain  extent,  this would lessen the need  for  more  golf\r\n\r\ncourses here.  But where we can, we should provide facilities\r\n\r\non  our  home turf for Singaporeans to indulge in what  is  a\r\n\r\nsport of choice for many.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will consider the focus group's recommendation not to\r\n\r\nprovide  any more private golf courses.  However,  we  should\r\n\r\nnot  rule  out  providing additional public golf  courses  on\r\n\r\nsites  which  cannot  put  to more valuable  use.   Recently,\r\n\r\nRECORD  III  recommended that a new  golf  course  for  NSmen\r\n\r\nshould be developed to recognise the important role that they\r\n\r\nplay in total defence.  This golf course would cater to NSmen\r\n\r\nmembers  of all the reservists associations, in other  words,\r\n\r\nSAFRA, CDANS and SPANS.  Since there is an NSman in virtually\r\n\r\nevery  Singaporean household, and since golf is a sport  that\r\n\r\nis  growing in popularity among NSmen, I believe  this  is  a\r\n\r\nrecommendation which deserves our support.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within our land constraints, we should try to provide a\r\n\r\nwide  array of facilities for Singaporeans to indulge in  the\r\n\r\nsporting  or  recreational activities of  their  choice.   In\r\n\r\nparticular,  we  should  recognise  the  special   role   and\r\n\r\ncontribution of our NSmen.  This is important if Singapore is\r\n\r\nto  be  an attractive place to live and work in, and also  to\r\n\r\nfight for.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some participants at the public forums suggested\r\n\r\nthat  land  set  aside  for golf courses  need  not  be  used\r\n\r\nexclusively  for golf.  This is an attractive  idea.   NParks\r\n\r\nwill  explore  whether we can open up some nature  areas  and\r\n\r\nwaterbodies  in  the  vicinity of  golf  courses  for  public\r\n\r\nrecreation purposes.  I must caution, however, that this must\r\n\r\nbe  implemented with care.  We have got to make sure that  it\r\n\r\nis safe for non-golfers and also the interests of golfers are\r\n\r\ntaken care of.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo Ho Pin has raised some points concerning the\r\n\r\nenvironment.   He asked whether environmental concerns  would\r\n\r\nbe  addressed in the Concept Plan.  Let me clarify  that  the\r\n\r\nConcept  Plan  is  not just the product or the  work  of  URA\r\n\r\nalone.  It is a combined effort of a large number of agencies\r\n\r\nand  Ministries,  working together on many technical  issues.\r\n\r\nThese   agencies  provide  inputs  to  URA,  guide  them   in\r\n\r\nallocating land, not only for housing, factories,  roads  and\r\n\r\nso  on, but also for utilities infrastructure, such as  waste\r\n\r\ndisposal  and treatment.  At the same time, they also  advise\r\n\r\non how to minimise the environmental impact from adverse land\r\n\r\nuses.  I just would like to inform Dr Teo that in the process\r\n\r\nof  drawing  up the Concept Plan, other plans,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nGreen  Plan,  which  is coordinated by the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, are taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Dr Teo also touched on the issue of over-heating of our environment. In preparing the Concept Plan,\r\n\r\nNParks,  URA  and  HDB have worked together to  identify  and\r\n\r\nsafeguard  areas  of open space and parks with  greenery  and\r\n\r\ntrees  to  mitigate  the over-heating effect.  BCA,  HDB  and\r\n\r\nNParks   are also embarking on a research programme on  urban\r\n\r\nheat islands in Singapore.  This is a matter in which Dr  Teo\r\n\r\nhas particular interest.  This study will include a study  on\r\n\r\nroof-top  gardens,  together with the NUS  Centre  for  Total\r\n\r\nBuilding Performance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of identity and\r\n\r\ndevelopment.    The  focus  groups,  as   well   as   several\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, have expressed the need to conserve more of our\r\n\r\nbuildings,  places and natural features which they  feel  can\r\n\r\nhelp   in  retaining  our  identity.   Mr  Simon  Tay   spoke\r\n\r\npassionately on this issue just now.  It is indeed heartening\r\n\r\nthat  more Singaporeans feel strongly enough for our home  to\r\n\r\nwant  to  preserve  our  social memories  and  in  doing  so,\r\n\r\nstrengthen our sense of belonging.  It was not too  long  ago\r\n\r\nthat  we did not care what our city looks like.  It was  even\r\n\r\nfurther  back in time when conservation of our built heritage\r\n\r\nwas a luxury and of lower priority.  This was when we had  to\r\n\r\nset out to solve critical issues of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhousing  shortages  and  how to earn  a  living  in  a  newly\r\n\r\nindependent  Singapore.    Times have  changed.   With  basic\r\n\r\nhousing and infrastructure in place, with economic growth and\r\n\r\nrising  affluence,  we can now turn our attention  to  issues\r\n\r\nsuch  as conservation, identity and shared memories.  But  we\r\n\r\nmust not get carried away.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As rightly pointed out by Mr Simon Tay, we cannot simply\r\n\r\nconserve  everything. We need to carefully consider  what  to\r\n\r\nretain,  how to retain and how much to retain, while ensuring\r\n\r\nbetter  use of land.  The process of selection and evaluation\r\n\r\nhas  to  be  vigorous. This is to ensure that while deserving\r\n\r\nbuildings and places would be conserved, we would still  have\r\n\r\nenough  land  to  meet  the needs of our future  generations.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when drawing up future plans for our city,  our\r\n\r\nplanners should consciously identify the buildings, features,\r\n\r\nplaces,  which  give the area its identity.  We  should  find\r\n\r\nways to integrate these so called \"identity markers\" into new\r\n\r\ndevelopments.  We should also look into how we can  safeguard\r\n\r\nthe   interest  and  factor  in  the  views  of  the  various\r\n\r\nstakeholders, the owners, the residents and the users.  These\r\n\r\nare  not  easy  issues  to  settle.  They  call  for  a  fine\r\n\r\njudgement,  coupled  with  an ability  to  balance  competing\r\n\r\ndemands.  The focus group on identity has proposed a heritage\r\n\r\nconservation   trust  to  help  Government  to   make   these\r\n\r\ndecisions. This is a suggestion we are seriously considering.\r\n\r\nThe relevant Government agencies will study it further to see\r\n\r\nwhether and how this concept can work in our local context.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the limited time, I have only touched on\r\n\r\nsome  of  the key issues raised so far on the  Concept  Plan.\r\n\r\nURA  and  the  relevant Government agencies will continue  to\r\n\r\nstudy  and  consider all the other suggestions  and  feedback\r\n\r\nfrom  Members of this House, the focus groups and the public.\r\n\r\nThe  Concept  Plan is still on the drawing board.   URA  will\r\n\r\nwork  towards exhibiting the draft plan to the public by  the\r\n\r\nend  of  April.  It will hold a public dialogue on the  draft\r\n\r\nplan to gather more views before the plan is finalised.   The\r\n\r\npreliminary conclusion, based on the work\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndone  so  far, is that as far as the physical development  of\r\n\r\nSingapore is concerned, we should be able to look forward  to\r\n\r\na  comfortable  life  even  if  our  population  reaches  5.5\r\n\r\nmillion.  There would be homes for all, industries to sustain\r\n\r\neconomic  growth and also room for our children to enjoy  the\r\n\r\nsimple pleasures of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to address some of the Members'\r\n\r\nspecific questions on land use and the Government land  sales\r\n\r\nprogramme and a few other issues.  Mr Goh Choon Kang  and  Mr\r\n\r\nLew Syn Pau asked about changes to the plot ratio of land, in\r\n\r\nparticular,  Mr  Goh asked about intensification  of  certain\r\n\r\nspecific  sites near MRT stations.  I would like to say  here\r\n\r\nthat  when URA determines the plot ratios for different sites\r\n\r\nin  the  masterplan,  factors  such  as  height  constraints,\r\n\r\nplanning  intention, character of the area and  proximity  to\r\n\r\ntransport nodes are taken into consideration.  Where  a  site\r\n\r\nis   surrounded  by  high-intensity  uses  and  is  close  to\r\n\r\ntransport  nodes, like the MRT stations, a higher gross  plot\r\n\r\nratio  (GPR) may be prescribed to optimise the use  of  land.\r\n\r\nBut if the site is next to an existing landed housing estate,\r\n\r\na  lower gross plot ratio may still be prescribed in order to\r\n\r\nsafeguard  the  amenity  and the low-rise  character  of  the\r\n\r\nexisting  landed housing estates.  The Concept Plan maps  out\r\n\r\nthe  broad direction in land use for Singapore. It  does  not\r\n\r\nlook  into specific plots and specific plot ratios.  This  is\r\n\r\ndone  only  with the Masterplan as distinct from the  Concept\r\n\r\nPlan.   The next review of the Masterplan will take place  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  2003, when we will take into account the feedback,\r\n\r\nsuch as those from Mr Goh on specific sites.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked a specific question about whether plot\r\n\r\nratios  would be reduced and if so, whether owners  would  be\r\n\r\ncompensated for the reduction.  I wish to inform him that any\r\n\r\nexisting  plot  ratio,  which  has  been  approved,  will  be\r\n\r\nhonoured, subject to prevailing height control for the  area,\r\n\r\neven  if  the  plot  ratio is beyond that prescribed  by  the\r\n\r\nMasterplan for that site.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nUnder  the  circumstances,  the  issue  of  compensation   is\r\n\r\nirrelevant because there would be no loss to the owners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked why the Jurong West housing estate\r\n\r\nwas  built  under  the RSAF flight path.  I believe  he  also\r\n\r\nraised  the same question in this House a few days  ago  when\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Defence's estimates were debated.  Let me say\r\n\r\nthat in land scarce Singapore, we need to do a balancing act.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  balance  various land uses,  such  as  housing,\r\n\r\nschools,  airports, etc, within this limited land area.   And\r\n\r\nwhen  you  do  a  balancing  act,  inevitably,  you  have  to\r\n\r\ncompromise  between these various uses.  However,  that  does\r\n\r\nnot  mean  to  say  that we totally ignore the  dis-amenities\r\n\r\ncaused by different uses. There are guidelines in place  that\r\n\r\nare  prescribed  to  limit the impact of nuisances,  such  as\r\n\r\nnoise  nuisance,  smell  nuisance,  pollution,  etc,  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious land uses.  In the case of Jurong West, let me assure\r\n\r\nhim  that  the  location of the housing  area  satisfies  the\r\n\r\nguidelines set by the Pollution Control Department  on  noise\r\n\r\nlevels,  within which housing may be permitted.  I understand\r\n\r\nthat MINDEF is taking steps to reduce the noise nuisance from\r\n\r\nRSAF  flights  where  possible, but it is  not  realistic  to\r\n\r\nexpect  that the residents in the estate can enjoy the  peace\r\n\r\nand  quiet  that other residents in other parts of  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  able to enjoy.  If we were, for example, to specify that\r\n\r\nno  housing estates be built under flight paths, today  there\r\n\r\nwould be very few housing estates in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lew asked about the setting of reserve prices for\r\n\r\nsale  sites  and  whether  in so  doing,  the  Government  is\r\n\r\ninterfering in the market.  He asked how URA decides what the\r\n\r\nmarket  price is and why the Government could not just  leave\r\n\r\nit  to the market to decide prices, and just award it to  the\r\n\r\nhighest  price  irrespective.   Let  me  say  here  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  does  not arbitrarily set any so-called  \"reserve\r\n\r\nprice\".  The reserve price is set according to Chief Valuer's\r\n\r\nassessed market value for the site and this value takes  into\r\n\r\naccount evidence from recent property transactions and  other\r\n\r\nrelevant indicators of market sentiment.  As a prudent land\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nowner,  and  as  a  custodian of the  State's  reserves,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has the responsibility to ensure that it  obtains\r\n\r\nfair  value  in the disposal of State land, and  the  reserve\r\n\r\nprice  provides  an  objective basis to guide  the  award  of\r\n\r\ntender  for  State  land.  To allow for  some  variations  in\r\n\r\nmarket opinion from the Chief Valuer's estimates, the highest\r\n\r\nstandard  for a site is accepted so long as it  is  not  less\r\n\r\nthan  85%  of the Chief Valuer's assessed market value.   The\r\n\r\nMember  did say that he is not suggesting that land would  be\r\n\r\nsold  in  Singapore for $1.  I think that  is  precisely  the\r\n\r\npoint:   should we sell land at a price which is ridiculously\r\n\r\nlow  or  far below what is considered, at least by the  Chief\r\n\r\nValuer, to be the fair market value at that point in time?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to emphasise that this policy of selling\r\n\r\nland  is  not intended to prop up or to lead property prices.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to a steady land release strategy\r\n\r\nto  make  available land for development.  It is  up  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopers  to  decide to tender and at what price  based  on\r\n\r\ntheir  own reading of market demand.  I stress again that  it\r\n\r\nis  not  prudent  for Government to accept  any  tender  just\r\n\r\nbecause  it  happens  to  be  the  highest  tender  in   that\r\n\r\nparticular exercise.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Ong Kian Min spoke about the abuse of mixed\r\n\r\nuse  developments,  and  he cited a specific  case  of  Lucky\r\n\r\nPlaza.   Sir, we are actually trying to introduce more  mixed\r\n\r\nuse  into  our estates.  For example, last June, URA actually\r\n\r\nrelaxed  the guidelines for industry, warehouse and  business\r\n\r\npark zones to allow more mixed use, eg, e-businesses and dot-com companies to set up offices within these zones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Mr Ong's concerns about such abuse. This,\r\n\r\ninevitably, takes place when owners try to take advantage  of\r\n\r\nthe  system  for  their own benefit, at the  expense  of  the\r\n\r\nconvenience  and  amenity of others.  There  is  always  this\r\n\r\ngroup  of people who are very quick to try and arbitrage  the\r\n\r\nsystem.  But this is the risk that we have to take.  If it is\r\n\r\na major\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nloophole, we will have to plug it.  If not, then we just have\r\n\r\nto  depend  on enforcement from time to time.  But we  cannot\r\n\r\njust stand still and do nothing, and not to take into account\r\n\r\nthe   changing  circumstances,  just  because  there   is   a\r\n\r\npossibility of abuse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe I have addressed most of the concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I requested for additional sports\r\n\r\nfacilities at the local precinct level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am sorry. In so far as the provision\r\n\r\nof  sports facilities is concerned in housing estates,  I  do\r\n\r\nsympathise with the Member's view that there should  be  more\r\n\r\nsports facilities.  Indeed, there are sports facilities being\r\n\r\nprovided  in the Concept Plan on a total basis.   But  on  an\r\n\r\nestate by estate basis, there may be instances where there is\r\n\r\na  shortage of such facilities.  One of the things  that  the\r\n\r\nURA is looking into, together with other relevant Ministries,\r\n\r\nis,  for  example, the question of shared use.  If  we  could\r\n\r\nfind  a way to use existing facilities in the housing estates\r\n\r\nwhich  are  under utilised, eg, the school fields,  we  could\r\n\r\nactually increase the number of such fields available for our\r\n\r\nresidents to use.  Another possibility, of course, is to make\r\n\r\nuse of some of the existing open spaces, and here I think  we\r\n\r\nwould  have  to again contend with this issue of  conflicting\r\n\r\ndemands.   By this, I mean that if we were to open  up,  say,\r\n\r\nsome  of the open spaces to children for playing ball  games,\r\n\r\ninevitably,  there will be complaints about  noise,  nuisance\r\n\r\nand so on.  Of course, these are not insurmountable problems,\r\n\r\nbut I just wish to point out such problems will arise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all that, of course, I think the point that\r\n\r\nthe  Member made is well taken, that we should look into  how\r\n\r\nwe  can provide more such facilities.  And I will support any\r\n\r\nsuch  moves to increase the number of facilities and  I  will\r\n\r\nrefer his request to my colleague, the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Sports, to take up with the other agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, the primary purpose of building HDB\r\n\r\nneighbourhood   shops  and  hawker  stalls  is   to   provide\r\n\r\nconvenient shopping for HDB residents.  But these shopkeepers\r\n\r\nand hawkers are now facing an uphill task to survive in their\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   What has caused this situation?  The  following\r\n\r\nare some of the problems faced by them:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is an oversupply of shops in the neighbourhood\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;area;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) There is inadequate control of tenant mix in some areas,\r\n\r\nleading   to   duplication  of  services   and   insufficient\r\n\r\ncomplementary shops;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The rental rates are too high, and too much\r\n\r\nmultiple  subletting has been allowed.  This has  drastically\r\n\r\nreduced   the  price  competitiveness  of  their  goods   and\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to recommend three measures for HDB to\r\n\r\nconsider  in  making neighbourhood shops and  hawker  centres\r\n\r\nmore viable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Lower rental cost and property tax. HDB should\r\n\r\nreview  its  policy of determining rental rates.   We  should\r\n\r\nadopt  the practice of private developers who use  fixed  and\r\n\r\nvariable rental rates to help their tenants to build up their\r\n\r\nbusinesses.   We  should also consider lowering  or  removing\r\n\r\nproperty tax, especially for hawker stalls.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Control tenant mix. HDB must control tenant mix as\r\n\r\nin  private  development.  This will ensure fair  competition\r\n\r\nand  viability for their businesses.  A good tenant mix  will\r\n\r\nprovide  a  wider range of services.  HDB should also  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  ATMs,  post  offices, banks, clinics and  childcare  or\r\n\r\nfamily  service centres are present to complement  the  shops\r\n\r\nand  hawker stalls.  We must not allow the change of use from\r\n\r\nretail shops to offices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Upgrade business practices. We must encourage all\r\n\r\nHDB  shopowners  and hawker stallholderss  to  upgrade  their\r\n\r\noperations to increase productivity and competitiveness.   As\r\n\r\nan incentive, HDB should consider providing rental rebates\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nor  property  tax  rebates for shops  or  stalls  which  have\r\n\r\nsuccessfully upgraded their operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nrecent  economic recovery and the slowdown of the US  economy\r\n\r\nled us to face uncertainties in our economy.  Many retailers,\r\n\r\nshopkeepers and stallholders in HDB estates do not enjoy  the\r\n\r\nbenefit  from our economic recovery.  All that they  feel  is\r\n\r\nthat  they have bad business, mounting costs and turnover  is\r\n\r\nlower.   They are full of complaints and grievances.  At  the\r\n\r\nmoment,  the  retailers and hawkers find  that  the  cost  is\r\n\r\nalmost unbearable.  Although the present situation is not  so\r\n\r\nserious,  the moment the US economy gets worse  and  sends  a\r\n\r\ngreater impact on Asia, the situation can be very serious.  I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister  can  seriously  consider  the  following\r\n\r\nsuggestions:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, those who have already bought their shops on a\r\n\r\n99-year lease, we should allow them to reduce the lease  from\r\n\r\nthe  current  99  years to either 30 or 60 years.   Then  the\r\n\r\nsurplus money could be refunded to the shopowners, so  as  to\r\n\r\nlighten their burden.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as Dr Teo has mentioned that there are too\r\n\r\nmany shops in the older  housing estates, HDB should buy back\r\n\r\nthe  shops  from those operators who are not able to  sustain\r\n\r\ntheir  business.  They may have a problem of sustaining their\r\n\r\nbusiness,  but  because they have already bought  the  shops,\r\n\r\nthey have to pay their instalments to the banks.  They are in\r\n\r\ngreat  financial difficulties.   So, if it is possible,   HDB\r\n\r\nshould buy back the shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would suggest that the Government lower the\r\n\r\nrentals  and  the service charges for the shops  in  the  HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   For  those who are having MUP,  the shopowners  do\r\n\r\nnot  have much benefit because they have to pay a high amount\r\n\r\nof  renovation or upgrading charges, unlike the residents who\r\n\r\nonly  pay 20-40%.  I hope the Government will allow  them  to\r\n\r\nenjoy the upgrading, but without having to pay so much money.\r\n\r\nIf we insist on their paying so much, there will be a greater\r\n\r\nburden for them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, make some refinancing arrangement with the\r\n\r\nbank  to  lower  the  monthly  instalments  payable  by   the\r\n\r\nshopkeepers.    As   business  is  bad,   they   have   great\r\n\r\ndifficulties  paying the high instalments and  high  interest\r\n\r\nevery month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from those who have bought the shops, some of the\r\n\r\nretailers are actually renting the shops from the HDB.   They\r\n\r\nhave  difficulties.   I  have three  proposals.   First,  HDB\r\n\r\nshould  consider  lowering the rentals and  service  charges.\r\n\r\nBecause some of the shops are not doing well and they  cannot\r\n\r\nafford to pay the high rentals.  Second, the number of  shops\r\n\r\nin  HDB estates should be smaller, whether they are purchased\r\n\r\nor  leased.  If there are too many shops, it is very hard for\r\n\r\nthe businesses to survive.  If they can reduce the number  of\r\n\r\nshops  in the estates or to pay some kind of compensation  to\r\n\r\nbuy  back  the shops, the recovered shops can be turned  into\r\n\r\nvoid  decks,  and  there will be more  space  for  grassroots\r\n\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, consider reducing the floor area of the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  shops.   Some of these shophouses  have  floor\r\n\r\nareas  of 60, 90 or 120 square metres, but they only need  30\r\n\r\nsquare metres.  If they can reduce the size of the shops, the\r\n\r\nrentals will be correspondingly reduced, and this will  be  a\r\n\r\nhelp to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hawker stallholders, they have two problems.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  for  these  people,  the  Government  can  consider\r\n\r\nlowering the rentals of their stalls, especially in the  case\r\n\r\nof  the  stalls  which were originally  tendered.   When  the\r\n\r\ncontracts expire, the rentals are adjusted upwards.  In  some\r\n\r\ncases,  the tendered rental was already very high,   yet  you\r\n\r\nadjust it further upwards.  It would be unreasonably high and\r\n\r\nalmost  impossible for the stallholder to carry on  with  his\r\n\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I can see that some hawkers are doing a\r\n\r\nroaring  trade.   They live in big houses and drive  Mercedes\r\n\r\ncars.   If  they are good in their trade and want  to  expand\r\n\r\ntheir  stall space, they should be allowed to take  over  the\r\n\r\nvacant stalls nearby, so that they can expand their business.\r\n\r\nFor these people, if there is more space for them to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\noperate,  they  will be able to do better  business.   So  we\r\n\r\nshould  not restrict them to just one or two stalls, but  let\r\n\r\nthem  rent as many stalls as they wish, so long as there  are\r\n\r\nvacancies and they can afford them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope these proposals will be considered by the\r\n\r\nMinister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> For the benefit of all those who want to\r\n\r\nspeak later on, please make your speeches short.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Sir, if one were to look around the\r\n\r\nhousing estates, it is a no brainer to conclude that there is\r\n\r\nan  over supply of shops in some areas where human traffic is\r\n\r\nlow  and  business is poor, and an under supply of  shops  in\r\n\r\nother  areas, because they are popular.  People  flock  there\r\n\r\nand  retailers do a roaring trade.  The reason  for  this  is\r\n\r\nsimple.   HDB decides on a new town from the top down.   From\r\n\r\nthe  planner's  point of view, which at times  can  be  quite\r\n\r\nacademic  in nature, it is like there is an open field  where\r\n\r\nyou  want to design and build a footpath for people  to  use.\r\n\r\nYou  can  build  one, but people may choose not  to  use  it,\r\n\r\nbecause it is not convenient.  Or you can wait for the people\r\n\r\nto  carve a natural path through the grass and then  pave  it\r\n\r\nand make it into a footpath.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When HDB designates a particular area to house the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  shops,  there is no  guarantee  that  it  will\r\n\r\nsuccessfully develop into a popular and attractive place that\r\n\r\nresidents  want  to  visit.  Many factors  are  involved  and\r\n\r\nconsumers' preferences are fickle and hard to determine.  Bus\r\n\r\nservices, car park, accessibility, tenant mix and many  other\r\n\r\nfactors affect the success of the neighbourhood centres.  The\r\n\r\nplans  may  look good on paper but actual implementation  may\r\n\r\nproduce  a  very different result.  Of course,  there  is  no\r\n\r\ndenying  that  the  planners can do  a  lot  more  to  ensure\r\n\r\nsuccess.  For example, if you put a critical number of  shops\r\n\r\ntogether,  integrate  them with the bus interchange  and  MRT\r\n\r\nstation, like Tampines regional centre, the chances are  that\r\n\r\nit  will  become  a success.  But other fringe  neighbourhood\r\n\r\ncentres are not so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfortunate.  As a result, many shopkeepers in fringe areas are\r\n\r\nnot  faring well.  For these areas, there must be a mechanism\r\n\r\nfor  the  excess to be cut down.  Retailers who  have  rented\r\n\r\nshops  from  the  HDB should have the option  to  voluntarily\r\n\r\nsurrender their lease for compensation.\r\n\r\n<br>6.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the other side of the same problem of\r\n\r\ndetermining  the optimal number of shops for  any  particular\r\n\r\narea  is  that  there are many new housing estates,  like  my\r\n\r\nconstituency, Pasir Ris GRC, with very few retail outlets  in\r\n\r\nsome  precincts.  These shops are few and far between, making\r\n\r\nit difficult for residents to get their necessities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To tackle these two problems - too many shops in some\r\n\r\nareas  and too few in other areas - we need to find  a  right\r\n\r\nbalance and the right tenant mix in between.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to rethink and revamp the retail scene\r\n\r\nin  the  housing estates in the light of the changes  in  our\r\n\r\nshopping  and  buying  habits.  One of the  reasons  why  our\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  shops are not doing so well is the  change  in\r\n\r\npeople's  buying habits.  People buy the bulk  of  what  they\r\n\r\nneed  from the large supermarkets and shopping malls.  People\r\n\r\nalso  prefer  to wait for the right occasion to buy  an  item\r\n\r\nthat they do not need urgently.  For example, if you want  to\r\n\r\nbuy  an expensive watch, you would rather make a special trip\r\n\r\nto  a  popular shopping mall than buy it from a neighbourhood\r\n\r\nshop.   In  these  smaller neighbourhood  shops,  people  are\r\n\r\nlooking  for  things that they need urgently.   This  is  the\r\n\r\nsuccess behind the 7-Eleven stores.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 7-Eleven stores provide us with a model that has\r\n\r\nbeen proven to be highly successful, despite high rentals and\r\n\r\nbusiness overheads.  People do not mind paying more  for  the\r\n\r\nconvenience   of   getting  items  they  need   quickly   and\r\n\r\nconveniently.   These stores are popular in  many  countries,\r\n\r\nincluding Japan and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 980</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nHong   Kong.   They  have  become  entrenched  in  the  local\r\n\r\ncommunity.   As  an  essential piece in  the  infrastructure,\r\n\r\npeople in these countries are even thinking of using them  to\r\n\r\noffer   other  services,  such  as  paying  utilities  bills,\r\n\r\nwithdrawing money, buying stamps and posting letters.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge HDB to consider facilitating the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of such a network of convenience stores  in  our\r\n\r\nhousing estates.  If retailers were to upgrade their offering\r\n\r\nof  goods  and  services, I dare say  that  they  would  find\r\n\r\nthemselves  more relevant in serving the needs of  the  local\r\n\r\ncommunity,  and  more  people  and  more  businesses  flowing\r\n\r\nthrough their shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to what many people believe, opening a retail\r\n\r\nshop  is  not an easy matter.  In my constituency, I  have  a\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  centre.  The shops there have  been  sold  and\r\n\r\nmost of them are rented out by the private owners who are now\r\n\r\nlandlords.   I  speak to the shopkeepers there from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.   But  it is difficult to keep track because they  come\r\n\r\nand  go so quickly, some within months.  Some of the aspiring\r\n\r\nretailers are first-timers taking the plunge.  They  complain\r\n\r\nto  me that business is so quiet that they do not make enough\r\n\r\nto  pay their rent.  When I told them that perhaps they  were\r\n\r\npaying  too  high  a  rent,  they  told  me  that  they  were\r\n\r\ninexperienced  and did not know.  Some of them  were  retired\r\n\r\ncivil  servants,  ex-army  officers and  company  executives.\r\n\r\nSome  left  good-paying jobs to go into the retail  business.\r\n\r\nSome had been retrenched and decided to use their savings and\r\n\r\nretrenchment benefits to start out on their own.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being new to the trade and not familiar with the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood,  they  had decided to rent  the  shop  without\r\n\r\ndoing  much feasibility study or ground research.   They  had\r\n\r\nagreed  to pay a very high rent which cannot be sustained  by\r\n\r\nthe  low pedestrian traffic and poor business.  Many  had  to\r\n\r\nclose shop after a few months.  One would think that the next\r\n\r\nguy to come along would be wiser. But that is not the case.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere  is always some other guy with equally limited business\r\n\r\nsavvy who wants to give it a shot and pay the same high  rent\r\n\r\nfor the shop.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To alleviate the situation and as its contribution to\r\n\r\nRetail  21, I believe the HDB should do more in advising  and\r\n\r\nguiding  people who want to open retail shops in HDB estates.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to  urge HDB to offer some form  of  business\r\n\r\nconsultancy  or  business intelligence  service  through  its\r\n\r\nnetwork of branch offices, where a prospective tenant can get\r\n\r\nsome  assistance and guidance in assessing the local business\r\n\r\nenvironment and the proper trade mix for that area.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I am still not getting the cooperation of\r\n\r\nMembers  to cut short their speeches.

Many of these HDB shop retailers, majority  of\r\n\r\nthem,  have been suffering in silence for the past few years.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  the increased competition from big retailers  in\r\n\r\nthe  nearby estates, as well as the changing shopping  habits\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans, you will find that their pleas have  become\r\n\r\nlouder.   Today, if you look at the topic, there are  11  MPs\r\n\r\nwho  are going to speak on this topic, although I notice that\r\n\r\nnone  of the Opposition MPs have thought that it is important\r\n\r\nenough for them to bring this up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask specifically the Minister what his\r\n\r\nMinistry  intends to do on the over-supply of shopkeepers  in\r\n\r\nHDB  estates.   I would like to also ask how  far  the  PSB's\r\n\r\nretail scheme will go to train and retrain retailers who  may\r\n\r\nnot  be  proficient  in  English and whether  there  will  be\r\n\r\nprogrammes  in other languages, so that they can  be  trained\r\n\r\nand retrained to help them seek a new livelihood.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 982</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to also ask whether the Government\r\n\r\nwill  be  prepared  to compensate existing  tenants  if  they\r\n\r\ndecide  to  call  it quits, not just to compensate  them  but\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Government will also buy back  these  shops  at\r\n\r\nmarket price.  And I believe that they will sell it at market\r\n\r\nprice  but the Government can consider offering an attractive\r\n\r\nex-gratia  payment,  so  that shopowners  can  pursue  a  new\r\n\r\nlivelihood.   Or,  alternatively, would the Government  allow\r\n\r\nthe  conversion  of the 99-year old lease to  a  30-year  old\r\n\r\nlease  at  market  price plus offering an  ex-gratia  payment\r\n\r\nwhich  is  attractive enough, so that many of these retailers\r\n\r\ncan tide through the difficult period?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is getting better now.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, I will be even shorter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister, in reviewing his policies for\r\n\r\nHDB  shops,  consider  the fact that just  cutting  away  the\r\n\r\nexcess  capacity,  doing away with the  shops  or  relocating\r\n\r\nthem, might not necessarily be the best way, in my view.  One\r\n\r\nof  the  better ways would be to reduce rentals, as mentioned\r\n\r\nby  my  colleague,  Dr Teo.  That could be  lowered  so  that\r\n\r\ntenants  could  still continue to do their  business  and  be\r\n\r\nprofitable.  These neighbourhood shops, the mom and pop shops\r\n\r\n-  the hairdresser, the food centre, the stationery shop, and\r\n\r\nwhatever - can help to keep our cost of living down.  Perhaps\r\n\r\nmore  flexible use of shops will allow the business  activity\r\n\r\nto go on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking back the shops and compensating them $40,000, or\r\n\r\nwhatever,  may appeal to some aged tenants but  not  to  many\r\n\r\nothers  who may have to depend on their business to  survive,\r\n\r\nas  mentioned  by another colleague just now.  So,  what  are\r\n\r\nthey  to  do  after that?  They move to another location  and\r\n\r\nthey  pay  higher cost of operation with higher  rentals  for\r\n\r\nmore  popular areas, where they have to move or give up their\r\n\r\nshops.   Can  these people be suitably retrained after  that?\r\n\r\nWhat  happens to those aged residents or low-income residents\r\n\r\nwho  stay in HDB flats who need easy access to shops, instead\r\n\r\nof travelling by buses and trains to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  retail  centre?  Where the shops can form a  complex  so\r\n\r\nthat  among  them they can organise themselves  and  together\r\n\r\nwith  HDB, form some kind of differentiation or mix of trade,\r\n\r\nthen   they  can  attract  customers  which  will  keep   the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood busy.  For example, I have suggested some years\r\n\r\nago in this House for MND to consider allowing shopkeepers to\r\n\r\nspruce up old housing estate shops, like the two-storey shops\r\n\r\nin  Tanglin  Halt,  for their unique 1960's HDB  conservation\r\n\r\nflavour on a 30-year old lease.  Of course, at that time when\r\n\r\nI made the proposal, it was rejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy can now allow for more flexibility of use.\r\n\r\nWe  have to be a bit wary.  There are externality effects  of\r\n\r\nretail  activity.   If some shops are permanently closed  and\r\n\r\nkept  vacant, then it would affect the business  activity  of\r\n\r\nthe  nearby  shops.  Those who want to carry on the  business\r\n\r\nwill  be  affected.   There will also  be  no  potential  for\r\n\r\nredevelopment  and better use of land, unless all  the  shops\r\n\r\nare  vacated.  Meanwhile, the life for everyone is made worse\r\n\r\nfor the remaining shopkeepers and residents.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I shall be short, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Sir, I have moved an adjournment motion\r\n\r\nin  this  House to highlight the difficulties  our  HDB  shop\r\n\r\nretailers face now.

Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I was going\r\n\r\nto  talk  about the ABCs of HDB shop retailers  and  hawkers.\r\n\r\nBut I have now got to shorten my speech.  I cannot go all the\r\n\r\nway to \"Z\".  I will just stop at \"F\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"A\" is for accolades. I think we have to praise our\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, retailers and hawkers for keeping  the  cost  of\r\n\r\nliving down.  They have helped us, we must help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"B\" is for business mix. I must join in the call to\r\n\r\nmake  the  business mix more intelligent and acceptable.   We\r\n\r\ncannot have people survive if there are five grocers in a row\r\n\r\nand three barber shops next to each other.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"C\" is change of use. HDB can be more flexible in\r\n\r\nallowing change of use, especially for sales.  People want to\r\n\r\nsell  their shops but they are then subject to change of use.\r\n\r\nAnd  if  HDB  says no, the sale is off.  For shopkeepers  who\r\n\r\nthen have to stay in the shops, they want to diversify.  They\r\n\r\nwant  to put up something else, besides groceries.  HDB again\r\n\r\nsays  no,  you  cannot.  This is only a grocer's  shop.   You\r\n\r\ncannot  have  a  florist next to it.  So  change  of  use  is\r\n\r\nimportant but \"D\" - Diversification is helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"E\" - for those who want to exit, I think we should have\r\n\r\ncompensation  programmes to allow them to exit with  a  small\r\n\r\nlittle  sum,  maybe for the rest of their lives.   They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  successful in bringing up their children and sent  them\r\n\r\nto universities.  Now these children do not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 985</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwant  to  go  back to the shop.  So let them have  a  sum  to\r\n\r\nretire in happiness and enjoy the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"F\" - when you diversify, sometimes they may not want to\r\n\r\nleave,  they  want  to  have their shop floors  strengthened,\r\n\r\nbecause  upstairs  is no longer a place for  them  to  sleep.\r\n\r\nThey  want to store their goods up there, but HDB says,  \"No,\r\n\r\nyou  can't  because  the floor is too weak.\"   Therefore,  if\r\n\r\nthese shopkeepers are willing to strengthen their floors, let\r\n\r\nthem  do so.  For new shops, I would ask HDB to perhaps build\r\n\r\nstronger  floors  so that other uses can  be  made  of  these\r\n\r\nshops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these things would then help to give our\r\n\r\nshopkeepers, for those who are entrepreneurial, a  new  lease\r\n\r\nof  life  and for those who are not entrepreneurial, to  exit\r\n\r\nnicely.  The same thing would go for hawkers.  If the hawkers\r\n\r\nwant  to exit, there should be a nice little sum for them  to\r\n\r\nexit because nobody wants to sell fish\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 986</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nanymore,  and  their children do not want to sell  vegetables\r\n\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think we can stop slightly early as a\r\n\r\nbonus for cooperation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Deputy Speaker left the Chair of the\r\n\r\nCommittee and took the Chair of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to report\r\n\r\nthat the Committee of Supply has made further progress on the\r\n\r\nEstimates  of  Expenditure for the financial year  2001/2002,\r\n\r\nand ask leave to sit again tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So be it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Fifteen minutes to Seven o'clock pm.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
