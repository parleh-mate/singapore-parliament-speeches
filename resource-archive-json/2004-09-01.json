Most directly, it reduces demand for our oil and petrochemical exports as consumers either reduce their usage or turn to alternative products. Other non-oil domestic exports and re-exports can also be adversely affected indirectly if higher oil prices slow down the economic growth in our key trading partners.</p><p></p><p> Oil prices sustained at high levels also affect domestic demand. Consumer sentiments may be hurt and prices of non-oil consumer goods could increase as businesses pass on the higher cost of <p align=left>Column: 303<p>energy. This is likely to lower private consumption growth in Singapore. Private investments, too, may become more sluggish if businesses believe that energy prices will stay persistently high, thus lowering the profitability of new ventures. The impact on investment may also be greater if interest rates rise with higher inflation expectations.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> The impact of high oil prices would not be felt equally among the various sectors of the economy. The transport sector would bear a higher share of the price hike initially since fuel enters directly into its costs. The manufacturing sector could also experience greater upward cost pressures due to the higher energy intensity and the reliance on petrochemical products as primary inputs for some of the activities.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> Nevertheless, much of the impact of an increase in oil prices is expected to be felt only with a time lag. Oil prices have only started rising sharply since April this year, and much of the impact of the recent increase is unlikely to be felt in the current year. The consumer price inflation in Singapore, for instance, remains low in recent months and most major economies have continued to maintain strong growth momentum.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> Hence, recent studies by the Asian Development Bank and International Energy Agency expect only small reductions in Asian GDP growth from the increase in oil prices. For Singapore, the ADB study released in June 2004 estimates that GDP growth this year will be 0.4 percentage point lower due to the increase in oil prices.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> The ADB projection is similar to estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. In a scenario where oil prices stay at an average of US$45 per barrel from August to the end of the year, GDP growth for 2004 is projected to fall by <p align=left>Column: 304<p>about 0.4 percentage point below the baseline case. If oil prices are assumed to rise to US$50 and remain at that level to the end of the year, MTI's projection is that GDP growth for the year could be 0.6 percentage point lower than in the baseline case. Most of the negative impact is expected to come from a decline in external demand for Singapore's exports.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> While the downside risk to Singapore's GDP growth this year has risen recently, the impact of higher oil prices alone is unlikely to result in the full-year growth for 2004 falling below 8% at this point. Preliminary economic indicators for July also continue to indicate that the growth momentum has remained positive.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> It is still too early to make an accurate assessment on how the economic outlook for 2005 will be affected, when the impact of higher oil prices will be felt. Much would depend on developments going forward, including the trend of crude oil prices. The MTI will closely monitor the situation and update its GDP growth projections, where necessary.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> The price of oil has shown significant volatility since the 1970s and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. We can best mitigate the impact of higher oil prices by adapting our business practices and lifestyles to improve energy efficiency. For instance, we could turn to the increasing number of energy-saving alternatives when choosing electrical appliances and devices. We could also switch towards transport vehicles with greater fuel economy.  These changes in consumption behaviour will only happen, however, if businesses and consumers receive the right price signals. Hence, we should not artificially suppress prices. Instead, we should allow prices to respond to higher energy cost so that demand for oil can be moderated. By doing so, we can continually limit our <p align=left>Column: 305<p>dependency on oil and reduce our sensitivity to future shocks in oil prices.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his assurance that we can still keep to about 8% GDP growth.

Mr Leong Horn Kee referred to the article where they postulate a probability of oil reaching US$100 a barrel. But for those who look at the fundamental demand/supply conditions as well as the whole supply chain, they have come to the assessment that there is no shortage, and they estimate that the price reflecting these demand/supply conditions will range between US$38 and US$40 a barrel. But, of course, those are based on fundamental demand/supply conditions. How the market reacts due to expectations and concerns about disruption of supply, this is reflected in both spot prices and future prices.</p><p></p><p> As I have said in my answer, the momentum of growth in Singapore is still very strong. We have had an average of 10% growth for the first half of this year <p align=left>Column: 306<p>and we are already coming to the end of the third quarter. The numbers for July show that the momentum has been maintained. We are reasonably confident that we should be able to end the year within our growth forecast. If oil prices remain persistently high, even to the level of US$100 per barrel, then the impact will affect us more in the longer term, ie, in 2005 and 2006, and for that we have to monitor and assess it separately.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah)</B>: Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two questions. Given the time lag between the persistently high oil prices and its impact on the economy, I would like to ask the Minister what is the likely impact on the consumer price index for the coming year. Secondly, is the Ministry, together with any other Ministry, makingconcerted efforts to reduce our reliance and dependence on oil given that oil prices are going to be volatile in the foreseeable future?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Hng Kiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, as I explained in my answer, the CPI impact is still very moderate for the time being. The overall global inflation situation is still reasonably benign. Energy prices impact only a small component of the overall inflationary picture. So we do not expect the inflationary situation to get out of control. But obviously energy prices can feed to other costs and this will reflect itself in the CPI later on after a lag.</p><p></p><p> On our dependency on oil and other related energy sources, as I explained in my answer, we import everything we use, and this is a long-term strategy that we have undertaken since the 1970s and 1980s to reduce our reliance on oil and other energy sources through diversification, alternative uses and through uses of other modes which are more efficient and to conserve the use of energy. For example, the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources is promoting the use of alternative fuel for cars. Our two biggest<p align=left>Column: 307<p> uses are electricity generation and transport. For electricity, we have gone to gas and we are looking at other sources. For transport, I think LTA is promoting the use of other modes of public transport as well as other energy sources.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:APEC BUSINESS TRAVEL CARD SCHEME--><p align=left>Column: 307<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>APEC BUSINESS TRAVEL CARD SCHEME</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Implementation--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Implementation)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ng Ser Miang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify; T: \"> 3. <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">Mr Ng Ser Miang</b> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry when will Singapore implement the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Card scheme which Singapore agreed to join in October 2003 as the scheme will allow Singaporean card holders visa free travel in 15 APEC economies, facilitating business travel between these economies.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; LINE-HEIGHT: 200%; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Ng Ser Miang (Nominated Member)</B>: Question No. 3, Sir.

If a consumer defaults on his payment plan, SP Serviceswould try to accommodate by arranging a second payment plan.If the consumer defaults on the second payment plan, his electricity supply will thenbe disconnected. If the consumer continues to default on his payment, SP Services would install a \"thimble\" in the consumer's water pipe to limit the flow of water.If the consumer whose electricity supply has been disconnected reduces his arrears by 40%, SP Serviceswould normally allow reconnection.</p><p></p><p> Any household facing financial difficulties may seek assistance from the CDCs and CCCs.

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs)are long-term contracts where the private sector provides services and facilities to the Government. A typical PPP requires the private sector to design, construct, finance, maintain and operate facilities over a period of 15 to 30 years. Previously, the Government would have undertaken each activity with a different company. Under a PPP, the private sector will bring these same or similar companies together, often as a consortium, to undertake the whole project.</p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"> Sir, because of the complexity and long term nature of PPP contracts, there are greater administrative costs involved. The Government can expect to save overall using PPP only if the projects are relatively large. The Ministry of Finance has set $50 million as a guide, meaning that all projects above $50 million should be considered for suitability as a PPP, while projects less than $50 million can also be considered, depending on the nature of the project.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"> Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can participate in the PPP consortiums as partners, contractors or subcontractors.

As for current services, all public sector agencies are now required to increasingly market test non-core services which they are doing in-house.

What will be the trigger point? Could the Minister also update us on the shortage of eggs in Singapore? My understanding is that there is a severe shortage. Why is therea shortage if there were measures to import eggs from other countries?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Lim Swee Say</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, Dr Amy Khor asked what is thetrigger point for the lifting ofthe import ban. Basically, AVA will considerlifting the ban only after Malaysia is able to declare that Malaysia isfree of the bird flu. Under the OIE requirements, this couldtake place 21 days afterthe Malaysian authorities have taken action to eradicate the causes of bird flu. In this particular situation, Malaysian authorities culledall the chickenswithin the affected areaby20th August. So the countdown of 21 days startson 20th August. Assuming that21 days after20thAugust,there is no new case of Avian flu infection, Malaysia will be able to declare to OIE that Kelantan isfree ofAvian flu. That is the earliest day when AVA will be able to consider lifting the import ban.</p><p></p><p> Secondly, Dr Amy Khor asked why there is ashortage of egg supply in Singapore.Basically, local production of eggs is sufficient to meet only 30% of our consumption. The remaining 70% is direct import from Malaysia. In addition to that, over the years, AVA has encouraged the traders to source for<p align=left>Column: 319<p>alternative sources.Today, we have eggs coming from Australia and New Zealand but they account for less than 1% of the market consumption. The reason why these sources have not taken off isthe higher costs of the eggs. For example, eggs from Australia and New Zealand will costbetween 35-40 centsper egg. So, under normal circumstances, consumers obviously will go for cheaper eggs and, as a result, there is no demand for the more expensive eggs. In other words, even though there are alternative sources,under normal supply situation, they are not able to compete due to the high costs. Andwhen there is an outbreak, when 70% of the supply from Malaysia is being stopped,the supply drops from 100% to 30%, plus1% or so from Australia and New Zealand. This is the reason why we have this shortage today.</p><p></p><p> The AVA has alsobeen encouraging the importation of liquid eggs and powder eggs. For example, many of the larger users -hotels, bakeries and so on,over the years,have started switching to the use ofpowder eggs and liquid eggs. So, over time, hopefully more and more of the largerusers will looktoalternative solutions.</p><p></p><p> On the whole, I would say that on the part of AVA, we will do whatever we can to achieve three priorities in food supply. Firstly,adequate supply in terms of quantity, secondly, safety of supply, and thirdly, stable pricing. Under normal circumstances, we would be able to achieve all three priorities. But, from time to time, when there is an outbreak of diseases, like the case ofHPAI, I think some temporary shortage will be unavoidable and I hope thatthe public could bear with us as we go through this temporary situation.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B> Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</B>: Sir, I have three supplementary questions. Who is<p align=left>Column: 320<p> checking on the price of these chickens and eggs to ensure that there is no rampant profiteering by the supplier and the sellers as a result of the AVA ban? The second question is: what is the Government's long-term plan towards solving this sudden shortage of supply due to severe disease contagion? What is the alternative supply route that the Government is currently exploring? My third question is: will the Government also consider liaising with the Indonesian government to rent land from our neighbouring islands to start modern skynet cover, also called concealedfarming, so as to prevent bird flu, infections by wild birds and keep a more stable supply of chickens for our future use?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B> Mr Lim Swee Say</B>:Mr Speaker, Sir,AVA does monitor the prices in the market. But I think what Mr Steve Chia is asking is whether we can do something to prevent the escalation of prices.Sir, this is not possible because, as I mentioned earlier, supply has dropped from 100% to 30%. When supply is not able tomeet demand, obviously prices will go up.</p><p></p><p>Mr Steve Chia may want to know that,at this moment, more and more trading houses arebringing in alternative supply from Australia and New Zealand, andfrom the Netherlands too. These sources of supply will be more expensive.In other words, we are going to see prices going up in the market, firstly, due to shortage of supply and, secondly, due to the higher costs ofalternative supply. Therefore, price escalation in the short-term is unavoidable.</p><p></p><p> Secondly, Mr Steve Chia asked what are the long-term plans to prevent this sudden shortage in supply. As I mentioned earlier,we have put in place alternative supply from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands,as well asliquid eggs,powder eggs. The reason why these have not taken off in a big scale is<p align=left>Column: 321<p> thehigher costs of supply. In other words, today, consumers do havea choice. If they are prepared to paya higher pricefor the additional supply, the supply will be there. For example, NTUC FairPrice is bringing in eggs from Australia. By the time it comes to the marketplace, it will cost about 40 cents per egg. So for those who are prepared to pay 40 cents per eggfrom Australia, the supply will be there.</p><p></p><p> Thirdly, Mr Steve Chia asked whether we have looked into places like Indonesia. Sir, let me just point out thatin fact, most of the Asian countries are affected by theHPAI. In other words, today, we cannot import eggs or chickens from Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, China, Korea and Japan because they are all affected by the Avian flu. My point here is that while it is easy to talk about developing alternative sourcesin nearby countries,in practice, it is very difficult to do so because when the disease hits us, it hits the entire region. But, notwithstanding that, I do not rule out the possibility. In fact, in my dialogue with the slaughter houses last week, one of the gentlemen asked whether it is possible for them to pursue the concept, and I told them that AVA will facilitate. In other words, if they are prepared to put in the investment and necessary measures to ensure that a particular island or region issafe fromAvian flu,AVA is prepared to look into the possibility of accrediting that particular farm as a potential source of supply. But we will leave all these to the market forces to decide.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mdm Halimah Yacob</B>: Sir, will the Minister consider extending the rebate period for businesses that continue to be affected upon expiry of the current rebate period?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Lim Swee Say</B>: Sir, as I mentioned earlier, the next review on the lifting of import ban will be on 11th September.In the event that we are not able to lift the<p align=left>Column: 322<p> ban and that the ban has to be imposed for a longer period, the AVA and the relevant agencies will consider extendingthe rebate duration.

These efforts build an appreciation of the diversity of the region and an understanding ofthe challenges and issues that the countries in the region face.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"TEXT-JUSTIFY: inter-ideograph; MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> It is also important to develop a group of students who have a strong grasp of the Malay language.

In India, the English language has been the language of government and a good part of business since colonial days, andnow, more than ever, it is the language of the professions,government andhigher education. But there is more we can do. We are encouraging, first, our schools and universities to link up with institutions in India, so that beyond the language we really get to know the Indians,understand the landscape and be more familiar with contemporary India.</p><p></p><p> Second, through our syllabus, we are doing a fair bit. India features quite regularly in our syllabus - history, social studies and so on - even starting from the primary level.

It is still there, but we have extended it to a lot more recent Indian history as well.The mother tongue languages that we teach in Singapore, Tamil and for the non-Tamil Indian students their own mother tongues, would also play an important <p align=left>Column: 326<p>role.But I would reiterate that our strength in the English language is a major advantage that we have in engaging India.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:REGULATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS--><p align=left>Column: 326<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>REGULATION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> 10. <b style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal\">Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Education in view of the mounting complaints against private schools whether his Ministry will consider regulating such schools to ensure better standards as well as fair treatment of the students.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> <B>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Minister for Education)</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, under the Education Act, private schools have to be registered with the Ministry of Education before they can operate.

Allow me to give some figures. The re-employment rate of <p align=left>Column: 330<p>workers from 40-49 years old as at first quarter this year was 51.5%. This isthe national average.  However, the re-employment rate of those above 50 remains lower than the national average. This is partly because some older workers withdraw from the labour market when they lose their jobs. The long-term unemployment rate - this is defined as someone who has not found a job six months after he has lost his previous job -for older workers above 50 yearshasrisen above the national average. It is 2.3% in the first quarter of this year, compared to the overall rate of 1.5%.

In particular, moderating seniority-based pay systems, where older workers get paid more than younger workers for doing the same work was important. The changes to CPF contributions for older workers should also be seen in this context. These changes, correctly incentivise companies to employ, reward and retain workers based on their performance regardless of age. And, therefore, even as the economy recovers, companies need to continue with efforts to restructure their wage systems.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify\"> Beyond wage restructuring, the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) adopts a multi-pronged approach to help older workers get jobs. To encourage employers to employ older workers, we administer the People-for-Jobs Traineeship Programme (PJTP).

But for Singaporeans, the most important question in their minds is: can our economy grow and create jobs? That is the fundamental issue. Ifwe cannot, then there are not enough jobs to go round. It is as simple as that. And it is very clear from the last five years that this is being demonstrated when the economy slumped. We could do almost everything and we did. And when there were external challenges like SARS or terrorism, we did not have growth, we did not have jobs. We did not do that much structural changes. We took hard decisions in terms of CPF, wage cuts, and this year, the economy grew and we are creating jobs. So I think in terms of job creation, our fundamentals are there. But the greater challenge for many of our Singaporean workers is that they can be left behind because their skills and aptitudes may not be quite consistent with the type of jobs being created. In other words, our new economic structure creates jobs. We must retrain and help Singaporeans adapt. If we can do that and can meet the challenge, then unemployment will go down.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang</B>: Sir, the Minister has not answered my question as to what is the Ministry's projection of the residential unemployment rate in the next five years.</p><p></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Dr Ng Eng Hen</B>: Sir, the current unemployment rate is 4.5%. What the unemployment rate will be, going forward, as I have said, is a function of many things. One is a function of growth because, ultimately, it is growth that creates jobs. And ifwe have another situation and there is no growth and there are, in fact, job losses, then our<p align=left>Column: 340<p> unemployment rate will go up. But if our economy does well, as it has been doing this year, andwe create jobs, our unemployment rate should go down if workers have the skills to go into the jobs.

There is no reason for her to have this concern. As I said, we still have a large number of blocks which are eligible for LUP. Therefore, I expectthe economies of scale will be with us for quite some time.</p><p></p><p> As far as priority is concerned, first of all, I think, as the Member is aware, it really depends on the nomination of the particular block or precinct coming from the adviser. So, if the adviser feels that certain blocks should be nominated, ie, should take priority over other blocks for whatever reasons -whether it is because there are more elderly in that precinct, whether it is because there is a particular need, or whether those lifts are especially old and therefore need upgrading -then obviously the Ministry will have to take that into consideration.</p><p></p><p> But I would like to remind the House that, ultimately, there is only a limited budget available for upgrading. First of all, there is a limited budget available to my Ministry. Within that budget, I have to allocate a certain budget for housing. Within the housing budget, I have to allocate a certain amount for upgrading<p align=left>Column: 343<p> programmes. Within that, I have to allocate some money for lift upgrading versus other upgrading programmes. So, given the fact that resources are not unlimited, there has got to be prioritisation. We would have to be guided, to a large extent, by the Members' nomination. But, overall, having received all the nominations, we would then have to make another decision as far as priorities are concerned.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</B>: Sir, would the Minister not agree that for lift upgrading - for those who have just failed - there will be still some economies of scale when you can tack on the existing project? That would also cause less disruption to the precinct. Because, if you come back later to do stand-alone blocks, you may create the same amount of disruption.</p><p></p><p> Mynextquestion is this. I would like to ask the Minister what is the plan to complete the LUP for all eligible HDB flats in the whole of Singapore and what is his Ministry's plan to speed up the project.</p><p></p><p> My thirdquestion is whether the Ministry will consider this issue. AlthoughLUP adds on a certain facility,this facility is not within the unit. Should it not be considered more like an IUP rather than a MUP and it should not be a co-payment basis? The reason why I say that isthe people who need them most - the elderly families - are the ones who are most likely to be less willing to pay because many of them are retirees, the unemployed orlower-income families.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>: With regard to the first question, I think I have answered Dr Lily Neo just now. It is a question of prioritisation. It is not necessarily true that blocks which have failed to achieve the 75% 'Yes' vote are more economical to do than other blocks. In fact, there are<p align=left>Column: 344<p> over 3,000 blocks in Singapore which arewaiting in the queue for lift upgrading. So, really, I should put this question to the Member. Within his own constituency, he has to decide which precinct has got greater priority in terms of lift upgrading - the one that has just been offered and failed to get the 75% 'Yes' vote, or some other precincts which are just as deserving, if not more so. I think this issomething which the Member ought to think about. It is not just a matter of economies of scale. As I explained, it does not necessarily follow that those blocks which have failed are more economical to upgrade.</p><p></p><p> As far as his second question is concerned which deals with ---</p><p></p><p></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Would you like to repeat your question, Dr Ong?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Seh Hong--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Dr Ong Seh Hong</B>:<B></B> My second point is, if you do it together, it causes less disruption to the area.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>: As I have said earlier, it does not follow that there is economy of scale when you are dealing with those blocks which have just failed. There are many other blocks which are just as deserving on that score.</p><p></p><p> The third question is concerning the issue of co-payment - why do we require co-payment for the lift upgrading? Over the years, before 1990 when HDB was building many flats, it built many different types of flats. There was the traditional slab block (with common corridor) and then, subsequently, it went into the segmented blocks where there was no common corridor but there was more privacy. People felt that they needed more privacy. But the problem with the segmented blocks is that the lifts do not actually stop on every floor. To provide lifts for all thesedifferent types of blocks is a veryexpensive exercise. As I indicated earlier, there is a limitedbudget for upgrading and within this upgrading <p align=left>Column: 345<p>budget, we have to try and achieve as much as possible.</p><p></p><p> He asked how long it will take for us to complete. If you take the rate at which we are currently doing LUP, we have done about 600 blocks over the last three years, say, 200 per year. We have about 3,000 blocks left. So, a rough back of the envelope calculation, we will need another 15 years to complete, if we are able to do it at the same rate. We are now looking to see whether we canspeed up this rate of bringing the LUP to residents. Over the last few years, we have tried to skew the budget more in favour of lift upgrading as opposed to MUP. We have implemented a programme known as IUP-Plus where we have added the lift upgrading to the IUP programme; hence the \"plus\".Through all these measures, we hope that we will be able to speed up the lift upgrading. Because, as all Members of the House would attest, it is a very popular programme and it is definitely something which will become more and more necessary as our population ages. So that is something that we will be looking at actively.</p><p></p><p> But whatever it is, it is still a very expensive programme to do. And it is therefore very important for us to, first of all, be able to have some indication from residents whether they really want it or not. If we were to offer it as a programme which is free of charge, I think there is going to be a lot of pressure for us to do it all over the place, and I do not think the budget will be able to take it.</p><p></p><p> Secondly, through a process of co-payment, we will be able to actually speed up the programme faster because residents will be paying a certain part of the cost, although that cost will be kept to the minimum. The level of co-payment today, from the point of view of the residents, is, I would say, very reasonable. It ranges from 5-15%of the<p align=left>Column: 346<p> cost. So the total cost, say, for a 3-room flat issomething like $2,000. So it is very reasonable.</p><p></p><p> He asked what happens to those who are not able to pay, the elderly residents, for example. Here, I would like to assure him that there are many schemes that are available for such residents, whether it is stretching of the payment to as long as 25 years, the use of CPF, and even the deferred payment scheme, if necessary, if the resident is really unable to pay.All these schemes are available to make sure that affordability for those who are genuinely in financial difficulty is not an issue. If they are able to get the 75% 'Yes' vote, then that should not be an issue.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MAIN UPGRADING PROGRAMMES AT PANDAN GARDENS AND PAYA LEBAR WAY PRECINCTS--><p align=left>Column: 346<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>MAIN UPGRADING PROGRAMMES AT PANDAN GARDENS AND PAYA LEBAR WAY PRECINCTS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> 17. <B>Dr Teo Ho Pin</B> asked the Minister for National Development (a) what are the reasons for the Main Upgrading Programmes at Pandan Gardens and Paya Lebar Way precincts failing to attain 75% support from their residents; (b) whether there areplans to review the Programmes; and (c) how many flats are presently eligible for upgrading programmes.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Speaker</B>:<B></B> You have about half a minute left, Mr Mah.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Mah Bow Tan</B>: Mr Speaker, Sir, last year, 68.8% of the residents in Pandan Gardens and this year, 71.4% of the residents in Paya Lebar Way voted in favour of the Main Upgrading Programme (MUP). As this falls short of the minimum 75% support required, HDB could not proceed with MUP for both precincts.</p><p></p><p> As for the reasons why some residents voted \"No\", feedback fromHDBsuggests that some residents in Pandan Gardens were worried about the uncertain economic environment and job securitylast year. In the case of Paya Lebar Way,<p align=left>Column: 347<p> the feedback was that some households had already renovated their flats, while others thought that they would have to pay for the additional space-adding item even if they vote for the MUP Standard Package.<br></p><p></p><p> Since MUP was introduced in 1990, 110 precincts have successfully polled for the programme. More than 110,000 households have benefited, or will be benefiting, from the programme. Two precincts out of the 110 did not vote for it. Thisdoes not suggest that the programme needs a fundamental overhaul.</p><p></p><p> HDB regularly reviews the scope of its upgrading programmes to ensure that they remain relevant. For instance, in 2002, the MUP was revised to focus on functional items that give tangible benefits.The MUP is heavily subsidised, and the Government pays up to 90% of the cost.Certain MUP improvement works such as the multi-storey carparks (MSCPs) are fully funded by Government.</p><p><br> There are about 230,000 flats that are still eligible for the various upgrading programmes. We will continue to review the programmes to ensure that they remain relevant to the needs of HDB residents.<br></p><p>3.00 pm</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p> <B>Mr Speaker</B>: Order.

It also helps tominimise the risk of first-time and minor offenders from being influenced by hardened criminals whilst in prison.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The present Home Detention Scheme was first implemented in May 2000. From May 2000 to the end of June 2004, about 4,074 inmates were emplaced on home detention.99.3% of the inmates successfully completed the programme. Only 30 failed tocomplete the programme. Given the success of the Home Detention Scheme, the Ministry of Home Affairsintends to expand the scheme to allow more inmates, especially first-time and minor offenders with short sentences, to benefit from it. Assuming that the prison admissions remain the same, as for the last two years, about 4,000 inmates would be put on home detention under the expanded scheme.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Currently, suitable inmates who are sentenced to not less thansix months' imprisonment and who have served at least half of their sentences in prisons will be considered for emplacement on home detention foraperiod ofup to six months. Clause 17 of the Bill will amend section 53 to expand the Home Detention Scheme such that suitable inmates who are sentenced to not less thanfour weeks of imprisonment and have served at least 14 days of their sentences in prisons can be considered for emplacement on home detention. Clause 16 of the Bill will amend section 52 of the Prisons Act to raise the maximum home detention period from 6to 12 months.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Inmates with sentences of more thanone month and of good behaviour are currently granted remission equivalent to one third of their sentence, subject to the inmates serving a minimum period ofone month in prison. Those sentenced toone month or less are currently not eligible for <p align=left>Column: 351<p>remission. With the expansion of the Home Detention Scheme, inmates who are sentenced to more than 14 days of imprisonment and of good behaviour will be granted one-third remission of their sentences, subject to the inmates serving a minimum period of 14 days in prison. For example, an inmate who is sentenced to 21 days of imprisonment will now be grantedseven days remission of his sentence and will serve 14 days of his sentence. Prisons Regulation 118(1) will be amended to reflect this change.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Sir, currently, the Schedule to the Prisons Act sets out the offences for which a person who has been convicted will not qualify for home detention. This ensures that inmates convicted of serious and violent crimes are not released on home detention. The Ministrywill retain the Schedule. However, clause 17 of the Bill inserts a provision in the Act to allow the Minister the discretion to release deserving inmates convicted of offences in the Schedule on home detention. Prison's experience is that there are such deserving cases. But let me assure the House that this discretion will be exercised judiciously and sparingly, taking into account the inmate's progress and response to rehabilitation in prison, the inmate's level of family support and the risk of recidivism by the inmate.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Other amendments to the Prisons Act</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Sir, I will now move on to the other amendments to the Prisons Act.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Pre-emptive removal of prisoners</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">The Minister is currently empowered to remove prisoners to another place when there is an infectious disease outbreak in prisons. Learning from our experience with SARS, the Ministryis proposing to provide for the pre-emptive removal of prisoners when there is a threat of an outbreak occurring in prisons.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p align=left>Column: 352<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Other amendments - delegation of powers</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">In addition, we have taken the opportunity to streamline the delegation of certain powers under the Act for greater administrative and operational efficiency.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Specifically, clause 5 of the Bill repeals and re-enacts section 25 to allow the Director of Prisons to appoint medical officers for prisons. It is administratively easier to empower the Director of Prisons to appoint the medical officers since the Director of Prisons will be the one entering into a contract with the medical service provider.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Clause 11 of the Bill amends section 39 to allow the Director of Prisons to produce prisoners in the interest of justice, such as when a remand prisoner is required by the court to be brought to the scene of crime when the presiding judge, prosecution or defence wishes to learn more about certain aspects of the case. For operational efficiency, this power will be delegated from the Minister to the Director of Prisons.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Clause 12 of the Bill amends section 42 to empower the Director of Prisons to order the removal of any prisoner if a threat of infectious disease occurs in the prisons. In a case of emergency such as during a SARS outbreak and where the Director of Prisons is absent or unable to make such order for removal, the order may be made by the Superintendent of the prison concerned or bythe Visiting Justices. Clause 13 of the Bill amends section 43 to allow the Director of Prisons to remove prisoners of unsound mind to any mental hospital or other fit place for safe custody within Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">A provision will also be included in the Prisons Act for the Director of Prisons to delegate his powers to the Deputy Director of Prisons where necessary. This is a common provision in other Acts, such as the Police Force Act, the Civil Defence <p align=left>Column: 353<p>Act and the Immigration Act. This amendment will make the provisions of the Prisons Act consistent with these other Acts. Specifically, clause 4 of the Bill amends section 20 to provide for the Deputy Director of Prisons to exercise and perform all or any of the powers, duties and functions of the Director of Prisons. This is critical in operational work for it empowers the Deputy Director to make certain decisions and take certain actions when the situation requires him to. For example, in a fire or riot situation in prison, where there may be a threat to life and limb, the Deputy Director may need to remove prisoners from the affected prisons to a place of safety.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">Other minor amendments are also being made to the Prisons Act to allow for better administration of the Act.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments to the Prisons Act</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>that I have presented today will allow more inmates to benefit from the Home Detention Scheme, and for our prisons to function more effectively.<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\">Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt\"> Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</B> Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill and would like to focus on the amendments to the Home Detention Scheme as mentioned by the Minister.<p></p><p> Traditionalists hold the view that home detention is not really a form of punishment. After all, the inmate is allowed all the comforts of home, and the effect of them having committed a crime and sentenced to a custodial sentence may be lost. So, the first question that I would like to ask the Minister is: how is the point driven home that this is still a custodial sentence and that the person<p align=left>Column: 354<p> put on home detention has still committed a crime and is properly punished?</p><p></p><p> The second concern is one that is expressed by some that the extension of the Home Detention Scheme is a means of reducing overcrowding in prisons, and that there is this hidden agenda that, actually, we have overcrowded prisons and, therefore, we extend the Home Detention Scheme. Sir, I would like to ask the Minister whether this is really the case and, if not, to tell the public that home detention is really a measure which would serve the interests of society.</p><p></p><p> Thirdly, there isthe reformists' view that holds thathome detention is a good thing, that it will shield first-time offenders from experienced offenders who are incarcerated in high security prisons and so on.</p><p></p><p> So, is there a move towards a more front-end type of home detention, ie, would the courts, for example, be allowed in appropriate cases to sentence a first-time offender or minor offenders immediately to home detention rather than going through a period of incarceration?</p><p></p><p> Finally, it is a concern that neighbours may face when somebody is placed on home detention. They may have a suspicion whethera person who is under home detention being allowed out before his time would be subject to close scrutiny. Would he have the opportunity to perhaps commit more crimes while he is out on home detention?</p><p></p><p> These are some of the concerns about home detention. They go in different directions. So, I hope the Minister can clarify as to which way we are headed towards in terms of penal policy.</p><p></p><p> With those comments, Sir, I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 355<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposed amendments to the Prisons Act are to be welcomed. This Bill proposes to amend, <I>inter alia</I>, section 53 which deals with the Home Detention Scheme by increasing the maximum period that may be served under home detention by reducing the minimum sentence of imprisonment imposed for a prisoner to be eligible for home detention by reducing the minimum term of imprisonment to be served before a prisoner is eligible for home detention, and by enabling the Minister to remove the disqualification of a prisoner under section 53 for home detention if he considers the prisoner deserving of home detention in the circumstances.<p></p><p> Hopefully, Sir, through the proposed amendments, the large number of select imprisoned citizens would be given an opportunity to be released and be with their families whilst serving sentence under the Home Detention Scheme. Our sentencing regime in the 21st century and in the 1990s, as compared to the 1970s and 1980s, has been very strict and deterrent-minded. It may serve its purpose. However, Sir, it may be worthwhile and timely for the authorities, the courts, the legal fraternity, including the Attorney-General's Chambers, the Ministry of Law, the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, the Law Society of Singapore and people involved in the administration of criminal justice in Singapore to revisit, review and decide anew what is the best approach to adopt in the criminal sentencing system. It should involve a balance between rehabilitation, reformation, deterrence and retribution form of sentencing of convicted accused persons. Where possible, Sir, we should avoid or minimise criminalising our citizens, and avoid sending too many of them to prison, except for serious and deserving cases.</p><p></p><p> With that, Sir, I do support this Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 356<p>\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, this amendment allows the Director of Prisons to release an inmate for home detention for a period not exceeding one year,from the current limit of six months. The prisons administration can also allow an inmate to be placed on home detention if his sentence is at least four weeks long and he has served at least 14 days of his sentence.This means that a person who is convicted ofa jail term of one year may in fact only serve 14 days in prison, then he is out of jail to serve the rest of the sentence at home.<p></p><p> Sir, I do agree that home detention is a good sentencing option for offenders who are not dangerous. The question is whether such an administrative measure would undermine the intention of this House which fixes the sentence, and the intention of the judge when he passes sentence based on the severity of the offence. If we say that 12 months in prison is an appropriate punishment for a specific offence, will serving 14 days in jail and the rest at home render the sentence a formality and will the sentence lose its deterrent effect?</p><p></p><p> On the other hand, are we giving the prison authority too much discretion to treat offenders differently? Are we prudent in giving the prison authority such powers to decide and, in fact, to amend the punishment meted out by the courts?</p><p></p><p> Sir, it seems to me that, if the Prisons Department would like more people on home detention and for a longer time, it could be their assessment that many of these inmates under their care do not need to remain in jail for that long. Does this mean that our laws are too harsh and the punishments or sentencing benchmarks are, in actual fact, disproportionate to the offences committed? If this is the case, should we not review the laws? Instead of working backwards through administrative release, why not legislate<p align=left>Column: 357<p> home detention as an option for the sentencing judge so that there can be more transparency in the system, instead of just leaving it to the prisons to decide?</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Wong Kan Seng--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</B> Sir, I thank the Members for supporting the Bill and also raising the questions so that clarifications can be made.<p></p><p> Indeed, we need to have all the stakeholders of the criminal justice system to take a close look at the various sentencing options. Thoseinvolved are not just thestakeholders of the criminal justice system but also the community at large, and that we need to balance the need to send a deterrence to those who committed offences and the need to re-integrate theminto our society and become useful citizens again. That is why when we first introduced home detention in 2000, I said we indeed had a committee to look at this and thoseinvolvedwere not just the Ministry of Home Affairs but alsothe Ministry of Law,the Attorney-General's Chambers. We also sought the views of the courts, plus others who might have an interest in this.</p><p></p><p> The committee chaired by the Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Prof. Ho Peng Kee, came to the conclusion that we need to have several sentencing options available to the judges, and community-based sentencing is one of them, and the Home Detention Scheme is part of the community-based sentencing. The amendment to the Prisons Act at that time allowed for the release of prisoners on home detention. An advisory committee chaired by prominent citizens, in particular, Justices of the Peace and other prominent individuals was formedto make recommendations to the authority. The inmates were then released, subject to certain conditions.</p><p></p><p> So, let me assure the House that when we implemented the scheme, we <p align=left>Column: 358<p>thought through very carefully the need to ensure providing a deterrent or retribution aspect to persons committing an offenceand his need to be rehabilitated and re-integrated into society, as well as the interests of the community to enjoy a safe environment within their own community. It is not a measure to reduce overcrowding, as suggested by Prof. Chin, because prison overcrowding is not a serious issue, although we do have prison crowding for the time being. But when the new prisons are ready, we will relieve a significant part of the overcrowding.</p><p></p><p> Looking at the number of prisoners we have at any one timeand the number of prisoners or inmates who are on home detention, the number of those on home detention wasa very significant number. We have only about 1,000 or 1,500 on average a year who were on home detention compared to the several more thousands who weresent to prison. So, let me assure the House that this is not a cost-cutting measure.</p><p></p><p> The Home Detention Scheme is not an invention by Singapore. It is something that is alreadyimplemented in other societies. Wemade a serious study of the scheme in other countries before embarking on it. The Home Detention Scheme is practised also in the United Kingdom, Australia as well as in Sweden, and we borrowed apage from their criminal law book.</p><p></p><p> The question by Mr Low Thia Khiang about a person being sentenced to one year in prison and would serve only a minimum period of 14 days is a misunderstanding. A person who is sentenced to one year will serve many more than 14 days in prison. In the first place, because he is sentenced to one year, he will have one third of his time for remission, meaning that he will have toserve a minimum of eight months in prison, of which half could be served at home, ie, four months at home and not<p align=left>Column: 359<p> 14 days, and four months are a significant period.During the period of home detention, he would be put on an electronic tag. He would be subject to curfew hours within his home, but he would be allowed to workoutside the curfew hours, which are normally between 7.00 am and 7.00 pm, and thereafter he has to remain at home. Therefore, there is no cause for his neighbours to worry that he isnot being under watch. If he is up to mischief and breaches the conditions for home detention, he would be sent back to prison. The fact thatonly 30 out of the 4,074 inmates who were placed on home detentionhad to be recalled shows that the scheme has been highly successful. Of course, we have to continue to watch this to make sure that the right kind ofinmates are selected, and the kind of inmates selected are the ones with minor offences or first-timers, and they do not fit into the schedule of offenders who are ineligible for the scheme.So, when a person is sentenced to a long jail sentence and the offenceis subject to the disqualification scheduleofserious crimes, he would not be released on home detention, so he would not make a mockery of the deterrent effect of the sentence. The objectiveof home detention is not to undermine the powers of the court or the intention of this House to subjectoffenders to deterrent sentences. Even though it is the prisons that decide on this instead of the court, we do this quite cautiously.</p><p></p><p>We had thought of letting thecourt to decide on sentencinga person to home detention. But, having consulted the courts, it is better that we make sure theoffender serves a period in prison before he is let off on home detention, because we believe that there is a salutary effect of serving a prison sentence. A person who commits an offence, however minor it is, ought to know that there is a price to<p align=left>Column: 360<p> be paid for it and therefore he should serve a period. Before this amendment,prison sentences of less than six months are not eligible for home detention. We thought there is some need to adjust this to enable the group that has minor offences to be allowed to be put on home detention. Hence, wereduced this period to </P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>14 days.<p></p><p> I believe I have dealt with the key issues raised by the Members.

Business trusts are business enterprises structured as trusts. They are an alternative to companies as a business structure. This structure is already used in other jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and theUnited States.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Business trusts are distinct from both companies and traditional trusts \u2013 with similarities and differences from both. Like a company, a business trust operates and runs a business enterprise. But unlike a company, a business trust is not a separate legal entity. It is created by a trust deed under which the trustee has legal ownership of the trust assets and manages the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. However, a business trust differs from traditional trusts \u2013 such as private trusts and unit trusts \u2013 in that it is running and operating a business enterprise.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> There have been indications of interest on the part of the industry in setting up business trusts. Whereas companies are restricted to paying dividends out of accounting profits, there are no such restrictions on trusts. Business trusts can therefore pay distributions to investors out of operating cash flows. The structure is thus suited to businesses involving high initial capital expenditure with stable operating cash flows, such as infrastructure businesses.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Investors can invest in the underlying business by subscribing for units in the business trust, in a manner similar to investing in shares in a company. The units can be listed on a securities exchange. Introducing the business trust<p align=left>Column: 362<p> structure inSingapore will therefore create a new asset class for investors, and potentially add depth and sophistication to Singapore'scapital markets.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> To allow business trusts to be offered to retail investors, it is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for the governance of business trusts.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill is formulated with two objectives in mind:</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">First, to safeguard the rights of investors or unitholders in the business trust; and</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Second, to establish the duties and accountability of the trustee-manager of a business trust and its directors, ie, the directors of the trustee-manager.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> MAS has conducted public consultation on the regulatory framework and draft Bill. There has been broad support for the proposed legislation. MAS has considered the comments received in drafting the present Bill, made certain amendments in response to the comments and published its responses to the comments received.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the key provisions of the Business Trusts Bill.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Registration under the Business Trusts Bill</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill sets out the requirements for the governance of business trusts registered under the Bill. The Securities and Futures (Amendment) Bill will make it mandatory for business trusts offered to the retail public to be registered under the Business Trusts Bill. Other business trusts, such as those offered to accreditedand institutionalinvestors will not require registration under the Bill. This is because such investors are generally better able to<p align=left>Column: 363<p> protect their own interests. Such business trusts may however be voluntarily registered under the Bill where, for instance, the offeror considers that the investors targeted prefer to have the assurance that the business trust is one which is registered under the Bill. Business trusts which are not registered under the Bill will continue to be subject to the Trustees Act, which sets out the general obligations of trustees.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Single responsible entity</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Bill requires that the business trust be run by a single responsible entity known as the trustee-manager. The trustee-manager must be incorporated in Singapore. The trustee-manager has the dual responsibility of safeguarding the interests of unitholders and managing the business of the business trust.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> This requirement ensures that fiduciary responsibility towards unitholders of a business trust is clearly placed on a single entity. The alternative would be a bifurcated structure, involving a manager of the business trust and a separateindependent trustee. However, the running of a business trust involves management of an operating business and the making of business decisions on a day-to-day basis. It would be difficult for an independent trustee to oversee the manager's business decisions. It would also be impracticable for a separate trustee to set out an operating mandate for the manager, without fettering the manager's ability to run the business as an operating enterprise. More importantly, it would be difficult to apportion liability for breaches of trust between the trustee and the manager. Adopting the single responsible entity model avoids this problem. This was the approach taken in Australia, in response to a number of cases in which the Court found difficulty <p align=left>Column: 364<p>in apportioning liability between the trustee and the manager.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Accountability of the trustee-manager and its directors</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The trustee-manager, as a company, would be owned by shareholders. It would typically be controlled by the sponsoring entity which had divested its business by setting up the business trust. The trustee-manager and its board of directors have a fiduciary duty to manage the trustee-management company in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. At the same time, however, as a trustee, the trustee-manager has an additional group of constituents whose interests must be safeguarded, namely, the unitholders of the business trust. The trustee-manager and its board of directors owe a duty to unitholders of the business trust to manage the business trust in the best interests of the unitholders. There is therefore potential for divergence between the interests of the trustee-manager and its shareholders, and the interests of unitholders. This may result in a conflict of duties on the part of the trustee-manager. For instance, the trustee-manager may wish to maximise management fees or may have less interest in minimising operating expenses which are paid to the trustee-manager out of the assets of the business trust. To cite another example, the controlling shareholder of the trustee-manager may influence the operations of the trust or engage in related party transactions that benefit the shareholder, to the detriment of unitholders of the business trust.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> To address such potential conflicts of interests, the Business Trusts Bill sets out the duties and accountability of the trustee-manager and its directors.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Duties of the trustee-manager and its directors</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill imposes a duty on the trustee-manager to act in the <p align=left>Column: 365<p>best interests of unitholders and to give priority to the interests of unitholders where these conflict with the trustee-manager's own interests.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Bill also imposes a duty on the individual directors of a trustee-manager to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the trustee-manager discharges its duties towards unitholders. Directors also have a duty to give priority to the interests of unitholders where these conflict with the trustee-manager's own interests. This makes the directors of the trustee-manager responsible for safeguarding unitholder interests.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Annual certification by the board and the Chief Executive Officer of the trustee-manager</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill requires that the board of directors and the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of the trustee-manager each provide annual certification on specific issues relating to the governance of the trustee-manager. In particular, they are required to certify whether they are aware of any violation of duties of the trustee-manager which would have a materially adverse effect on the operations of the business trust and the interests of unitholders. Where the board or the CEO is unable to make such a certification, the reasons should be disclosed to unitholders.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">This certification requirement is intended to make the board and CEO of the trustee-manager acutely aware of their responsibility to safeguard the interests of unitholders of the business trust.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Board composition of the trustee-manager</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill provides MAS the power to prescribe requirements on the composition of the board of the trustee-manager. MAS intends to require the board of directors of the trustee-manager to have a strong element of <p align=left>Column: 366<p>independence to protect the interests of unitholders. The test of independence will be based on three criteria, independence from management of the trustee-manager, independence from substantial shareholders of the trustee-manager, and independence from business relations with the trustee-manager. The details will be set out in the Regulations.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Audit committees</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> In addition, the trustee-manager will be required to establish an audit committee. The Bill provides MAS with the power to prescribe the composition and duties of the audit committee. MAS intends to require in Regulations that the audit committee has a strong element of independence. We also intend to require that the audit committee review the governance policies and practices applied by the trustee-manager in operating the business trust. This provides a further mechanism to ensure that the interests of unitholders are objectively considered by the board.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Setting out the rights of unitholders</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">The Business Trusts Bill sets out the rights of unitholders. I will highlight the key provisions.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Limited liability of unitholders</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill provides that a unitholder's liability is limited to the sum of money which he has expressly agreed to contribute to the business trust. Under common law, unitholders may be exposed to unlimited liability for the obligations of the trust. The Bill provides certainty and protection to unitholders by limiting their liability and puts them in an equivalent position to shareholders of companies.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Change of trustee-manager and trust deed</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> One of the fundamental rights of unitholders is the right to vote to remove the trustee-manager where the trustee-<p align=left>Column: 367<p>manager is unable or unwilling to fulfil its obligations to unitholders.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Bill requires that the removal of the trustee-manager be subject to a special resolution of unitholders \u2013 that is, it must be approved by 75% of unitholders voting in presence or by proxy. Removal of the trustee-manager may adversely impact the continuity of operations of the business trust. The 75% threshold balances the need to guard against the frivolous removal of a trustee-manager with the need to provide sufficient rights to unitholders to remove an inept or poorly functioning trustee-manager.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Unitholders have the right to vote on amendments to the trust deed. The trust deed is analogous to a contract between the trustee-manager and the unitholders. The Bill requires that amendments to the trust deed must be approved by a special resolution of the unitholders. This voting threshold for amending the trust deed is consistent with the approval threshold for amendments to the memorandum and articles of a company by shareholders in the Companies Act. As an exception, the trustee-manager may amend the trust deed without unitholders' approval where such amendments to the trust deed are necessary to comply with any laws in Singapore.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Civil liability</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> The Business Trusts Bill provides for any unitholder who suffers loss or damage because of any conduct of the trustee-manager to take civil action against the trustee-manager. Also, any unitholder may apply to the court for an order in the case of oppression arising from the conduct of the affairs of the business trust, or for leave to bring a derivative or representative action on behalf of all unitholders of the business trust.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p align=left>Column: 368<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><I>Conclusion</I></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> To conclude, the business trust structure provides an alternative business structure to companies, particularly for businesses with stable growth and operating cash flow. Introducing this new structure inSingapore will allow for a new asset class for investors and potentially add to the development of our capital markets. At the same time, there must be appropriate safeguards of the interests of retail investors investing in business trusts. The Business Trusts Bill puts in place a governance framework for business trusts, to protect the fundamental rights of unitholders and to set out the duties and accountability of the trustee-manager and its directors.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Sir, I beg to move.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"> Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Kian Min (Tampines):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on the Business Trusts Bill. As a lawyer in private practice, I advise clients on corporate and commercial law and welcome the introduction of any new mechanism such as business trusts to help companies raise funds for their business needs. I, therefore, support the Business Trusts Bill.<p></p><p> The business trusts structure is particularly well-suited for businesses with stable revenue and high cash flows with minimal on-going capital expenditure requirements. As most banks in Asia tend to lend against physical assets and have displayed reluctance to lend against cash flow, the Business Trust is a good alternative vehicle for steady cash flow low asset companies to attract funding.</p><p></p><p> Recently, Iwas cited an instance of a business that had a resilient cash flow of $700,000 a year but could not find a bank to finance it as it had little by way of hard assets, that is, real estate.Business<p align=left>Column: 369<p> trusts may be a viable option for such companies. Further, mature businesses that offer limited capital gains potential have a better chance to get a higher valuation throughbusiness trusts than an equity offering. For the unitholders of the trust, they would benefit from regular distribution out of net cash profits as opposed to accounting profits. However, notwithstanding these benefits, I wonder whether business trusts, in the form envisaged in the Bill, would be attractive enough for our local investment community. I would like to raise three specific points on the provisions of this Bill.</p><p></p><p> First, the Business Trusts Bill requires the business ofbusiness trusts to be run by a single responsible entity known as the trustee-manager who would have the dual responsibility of safeguarding the interest of unitholders, as well as managing the business trust. Although this combined role addresses the difficulty of apportioningfiduciary responsibility between trustee and manager, the people I spoke to, who are already in the trusts industry, are reluctant to be trustee-manager because they have no expertise running active business enterprises and the additional liabilities of having to manage the business are onerous. Therefore, it seems that the trustee- manager would probably be made up of people who are managing the operations, who now have no choice but to accept the additional responsibility of a trustee of the assets if they want to set up a business trust. But would these managers be so pre-occupied running the business that they sacrifice the interest of the unitholders? How qualified and competent would they be to act as trustees and discharge their duties to safeguard the interest of the unitholders?</p><p></p><p> Sir, this leads me to my second point which is about compliance cost. To protect the interest of unitholders, the Business Trusts Bill makes it mandatory <p align=left>Column: 370<p>that trustees-managers have on board independent directors and an audit committee to serve as a check and to ensure that the interest of unitholders are objectively considered. But these independent persons would require to be adequately compensated for assuming and discharging these onerous responsibilities. Moreover, the trustee-manager must be a public company incorporated in Singapore and could only run one business trust at any one time. This will result in additional expenses. Sir, larger and more established businesses already have a multitude of options to raise funds from the capital markets, such as public offering and public listing of their shares and issuing corporate bonds, notes and other commercial papers. For small businesses, the extra expenses associated with such mandatory requirements may prove to be prohibitively high.</p><p></p><p> While protection of unitholders should not be compromised, I believe every effort must be made to keep cost to the lowest possible minimum without sacrificing the quality of the safeguards. The cost of setting up and maintaining a business trust should not be so high that it becomes unattractive compared to other more economical alternative structures. For example, for smaller companies, venture capitalists are familiar with redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares. This is an extremely flexible and established instrument that is widely adopted by companies to obtain funding. These redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares could provide for redemption of the invested amount under certain conditions, payment of preferential cumulative dividends, conversion to equity ordinary shares and preferential rights in the event of distribution of assets, thus giving them quasi-loan and quasi-equity elements. Hence, the funding difficulties faced by small companies may not actually be due<p align=left>Column: 371<p> to a lack of viable or conducive investment structure alone and the introduction of business trusts may not address the difficulties of attracting investors' interest in the first place. Sir, if private investors and venture funds are keen to invest in a particular business, there are already existing funding mechanisms for them to make and protect their investment.</p><p></p><p> Sir, my third point relates to third parties dealing with the business trust. It is envisaged that the business trust be structured in the form of trusts with no separate legal existence. As the trustee-manager has legal ownership of the assets of the business enterprise and manages the business, creditors could only claim against the assets of the business trusts via the rights of indemnity of the trustee-manager, provided the trustee-manager has acted properly in incurring the liability. It would be cumbersome, impractical and probably impossible for creditors acting in good faith to conduct checks on whether the trustee-manager is acting properly for every single transaction entered into. This differs from the situation of a company and creditors dealing with a business trust would not have the same level of protection as creditors dealing witha company. Consequently,there is a need for potential creditors and people who intend to transact with the business trust to be educated on its structure, the inherent risks involved and their rights as creditors and counter-parties.</p><p></p><p> Sir, to conclude, there is a need to continually create new asset classesfor investors and add more breadth, depth and sophistication to our capital markets and business trustsare one such additional asset class. However, to strengthen our capital markets, we should also continue to promote the traditional investment instrumentslike stocks, bonds<p align=left>Column: 372<p> and other debt securities. I am told that following the Asian financial crisis, when financial institutions in Thailand were cash-strapped, the Thai government and corporations went directly to the market to raise funds by issuing bonds. This resulted in the Thai bond market taking off and growing rapidly. I would like to ask the Minister what steps would be taken to increase the market size and trading volume of listed bonds and, ata later stage, listed business trusts on our local market.</p><p></p><p> On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, ever since when I was doing my post-graduate studies in accountancy, trusts have been a popular subject. Then it was a popular vehicle not only for wealthy families to manage their wealth to ensure a smooth transition to future generations, but has also been used to manage family businesses while the owners of the wealth are still alive. Trusts have also been used by business partners, especially professionals such as doctors and accountants, who wish to separate their personal assets from their professional services in order to reduce exposure to heavy taxes and other potential liabilities.<p></p><p> Besides being a useful vehicle for tax and estate planning purposes, a trust in whatever form has its downside in that it has to be managed by a trustee, whom the settlor and the beneficiaries could depend on managing the trust. However, I am happy that Singapore would now have trusts that are actively engaged in business to be registered as business trusts and operate within its own legal framework. It could also raise funds from the public and act like a public-listed company. This would add depth to our capital market and clearly enhance the sophistication of our financial market.</p><p></p><p> On the subject of trustee-manager, clause 6 states that the trustee-manager<p align=left>Column: 373<p> is to be a company that does not carry on any other business other than managing the affairs of the business trust. Clauses 7 to 17 spell out its powers and responsibilities. However, could the Minister comment on how much should the trustee-manager be capitalised as well as its net worth before it is being allowed to act? This point is important as the trustee-manager couldbe penalised on many potential lapses of duties, as well as having to carry on a heavy load of expenses such as professional directors and audit committee members. Its fiduciary duties also open it to potential professional negligence and its cost of corporate governance would be high. There could be times when the risks-to-reward ratio ofa trustee-manager may not be that attractive enough to attract the right skills in managing the business trusts. Hence, a trustee-manager, I presume,has to be a company of good financial standing. Furthermore, the trustee-manager should be well-positioned financially to absorb high penalties. For example, clause 12(1) and (5) relatesto the duties of directors or trustee-managers to disclose interest in transactions or when holding any office or possess any property which might be in conflict with their duties. Such lapse in declaration could be innocentlyleft out in these days of complex business transactions, but without any damage to the business or the business trusts as well, but the directors may still be found guilty with a possible fine of up to $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years or both. On top of this, a further fine of $10,000 for each day such offence continues after conviction may be imposed although, in such cases, a fine is necessary and sufficient warning has been given.</p><p></p><p> Business trusts, like any form of trusts, have to contend with beneficiaries who are not satisfied with the way a business is run by the trustee-manager or are in dispute withfellowbeneficiaries.<p align=left>Column: 374<p> Such disputes may escalate and one party or parties that have a lot to lose may appeal to the Minister andAdvisory Committee and an Appeal Advisory Panel may be appointed to deal with these matters as provided for inclauses 88 to 91. May I find out from the Minister whether such Committee and Panel Memberswould be made known to the business trusts so as to provide transparency and confidence to the public?</p><p></p><p> Business trusts are on-going businesses and, as such, would have credit lines with their suppliers. In normal circumstances, trusteesare responsible for any debt incurred by the trusts and, in this case, under the business trusts, it is the same practice. However, business trusts may be listed as public companies and are larger than, say, a typical familytrust, and suppliers are exposed togreater financial risks. May I ask the Minister whether the creditors of business trusts have any rights that are better than any other trusts? As far as I know, creditors could only claim from the assets of the business trusts via the rights of indemnity of the trustee-manager, as my colleague has pointed out. As such, creditors may not want to do business with business trusts under the current level of protection that the Bill accords. However, looking at the opportunities offered, business trusts are interesting new models from which businesses could operate from and it provides a good avenue from which wealth could be created and protected. With somecreative financial planning, business trusts could be a good vehicle for wealth to be managed properly for generations to come.</p><p></p><p> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Business Trusts Bill.</p><p></p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mrs Fang Ai Lian (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker,I would also like to support the Business Trusts Bill. This introduces a new regulatory framework for business <p align=left>Column: 375<p>trusts which is a new class of business entity that combines the elements of companies and trusts.<p></p><p> As the Minister had said, this is already in operation in other countries, so it is good to see it taking root in Singapore, and it would add to the sophistication of the capital markets and also enhance our position as one of the world's leading financial centres. I am sure it would definitely bring cheer to the market place.</p><p></p><p> I remember some years back, the bankers were complaining about the gloom and doom, off-shore banks were moving out and operations were run down and the fact that we were not able to attract the newer and more value-added activities such as assetsand risks managements to Singapore as much as we would like. All that has changed, especiallywith the liberalisation of the domestic banking business and, indeed, this has prompted Citibank to announce a $1.5 billion investment into Singapore in Citibank Singapore. Offshore business banks are coming back and also beefing up their operations and indeed, thePrime Minister, in his National Day Rally speech, said that the financial services sector is hotting up again. Indeed they are hiring in bigger numbers now, much to the consternation of businesses like ours who have got to queue behind them, but we are not exactly complaining.</p><p></p><p> So a lot had been done in terms of stimulating the banking and financial services centre. There is still a wish-list and one relates to what bankers described as antiquated trust laws, especially relating to the traditional trust laws, for example, MrAndy Gan had said the private family trust laws. There had been a consultation paper which had been widely distributed and it has been rumoured that legislation would be<p align=left>Column: 376<p> introduced towards the end of the year. This is important. Bankers are looking towards the updating of these laws which have not been revised significantly because it would help to attract the funds, especially from Europe, which are seeking alternative financial centres because of changes in banking laws there. So whilst we await a revision to the legislation relating to the traditional trusts,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>the introduction of business trusts is indeed very welcome. Asthe Minister hassaid, business trust is a new form of trust. It is regular business and yet not regular business, because it is established under a trust deed and not under the Companies Act. And as he has said, it is well suited for businesses which have stable growth and stable cash flow because distributions are from the cash flow. It will also be suitedfor the strategic industries like power generation. The ownership can vest with the Government but the operations can be privatised.<p></p><p>Business trustswill add to the sophistication of the market place and I see it as a natural development fromReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which were introduced some two years ago. REITs are managed under the collective investment scheme under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA). Withthe collective investment scheme (CIS)under the SFA and with further amendments to the SFA, businesses can choose between CIS and business trusts.</p><p></p><p> REITs, introduced some two years ago, have been fairly successful. We now have four. We are first movers in this game and it has caused our neighbours to think likewise. And the speed with which they introduced REITs is quite phenomenal. In Hong Kong, their consultation paper came out in March 2003 and the final version came out in July. And Malaysia also introduced REITs into their budget and also exempted stamp duty from properties injected into REITs. So, <p align=left>Column: 377<p>we have the first mover advantage andwe are alsoquite lucky that these countries have not launched any REIT. My comment here is that the first mover advantage can be very quickly eroded if we do not take advantage of it by attracting more REITs and creating the critical mass and building up the industry here.</p><p></p><p> Soalso withbusiness trusts.They will add to the sophistication and depth of our capital markets and, more importantly, entrench our position as a progressive financial services centre. Because it has been said that it adds a new class of yield-based financial products for investors in Singapore as well as overseas. If we see the success of REITs, it has really changed in a very positive way how properties are managed. Every square foot of space is being maximised. We see Junction 8,Funan Centre and shopping malls being very vibrant. So it is with business trusts that businesses can see very positive changes.</p><p></p><p> One of the reasons why REITs have been so successful is perhaps due to the fact that it is able to enjoy a transparency treatment for tax. The tax is levied at the level of the unitholder. So if you are a corporate unitholder, you get taxed at the corporate rate and if you are an individual, it is tax exempt. So this makes REITs very attractive because you can quote gross yield instead of net of tax yield. And this has helped to move this business.</p><p></p><p>I have awish list for theMinister. Itis forbusiness trust to be similarly accorded the transparency treatment of tax to make it attractive and to make it viable. One worrycould be that there might be tax leakage because you enjoy a better tax collection under the one-tier system, and that there might also be a possible abuse by smaller companies using the business trust structure. Perhaps one way of getting round this problemis to accord<p align=left>Column: 378<p>transparency treatmentto the bigger trusts whichare to be listedon the stock exchange. So, the long and short of it all, my wish list for theMinister is, first,for the laws relating to traditional trusts to be speeded up.</p><p></p><p> Second, being the first mover, we have been very goodin a lot of the activities. People copy us and that is the sincerest form of flattery. We could perhaps take the offensive and copy those who copy us, and that is in relation to stamp duty. Perhapsstamp dutycould also be removed in terms of properties that are injected into trusts.</p><p></p><p> Thirdly, I would like to talk about the transparency treatment and that should also be accorded to business trusts. Because ifit is absent, then it will be the best equivalent to the companies enjoying other tax benefits and incentives, andit will alsobe equal to Hong Kong and behind Malaysia.</p><p></p><p> With the wish list and with the legislation in place,the Government could clearly say that they have done their best to pave the way for business trusts and then it is up to the business community to take it from there.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Andy Gan and Mrs Fang Ai Lian for their very useful comments and their support for the Business Trusts Bill, both for the flexibility that it offers to businesses in providing anew business structure that they can employ and also because it potentially adds depth and sophistication to our capital markets.<p></p><p> Mr Ong Kian Min highlighted a very important feature -I should say the key feature of the Business Trusts Bill -which is the fact that the business trust has to be run by a single responsible entity - the trustee-manager - who will have the dual responsibility of safeguarding the <p align=left>Column: 379<p>interests of unitholders as well as managing the business of the business trust. This combined role is something which we thought about very hard and it featured in the consultations that MAS had with the public. Over the year, both interested playersand a range of professionalsgave their comments on this.We considered them very carefully, andhave decided to stick with this single responsible entity model.</p><p></p><p> The reasons are quite important. In Australia, they initially had the bifurcated model wherethey had a separate independent trustee anda manager of the business enterprise of the business trust. And there were a few cases that had to go to court where the court found difficulty in apportioning liability between trustee and the manager. We are quite clear in our mind. We want to ensure that the fiduciary responsibility towards unitholders is clearly placed on a single entity - the trustee-manager.</p><p></p><p> Mr Ong is right that, typically, it will be a situation where the people who are managing the operations of the business that is being divested will end up being the people who are running the trustee-manager. They will have to take on added responsibilities. Beyond the responsibilities of running and operating the business, they will have to take on the responsibilities of being a trustee. It means that they have to appoint a board of directors with suitable qualifications. Some members of the board will typically be people with the requisite expertise in performing the duties of trustees. They can also appoint agents and advisers to help them fulfill their obligations as trustees, but the obligation remains with the trustee-manager as a single entity.</p><p></p><p> Compliance cost will be there, I agree, and it flows from two facts. First, there <p align=left>Column: 380<p>is an inherent conflict of interest that the trustee- manager faces between the duties that it owes to its shareholders - usually theshareholders ofthe sponsoring entity that sets up the trustee-manager - and the duties that it owes to unitholders who invest in the business trust. There is an inherent potential for conflict of interest.</p><p></p><p> A second reason why we had to place all these additional requirements on the trustee-manager and its directors is the fact that unitholders in the business trusts do not have quite the same powers that shareholders in a company do. In particular, unitholders cannot vote out directors, cannot vote on the appointment of directors of the board. So it does mean that we had to mitigate this lack of control with a range of other measures, to place other responsibilities on the trustee-manager and its directors that ensure that they will put priority on the interests of unitholders wherever there is a conflict of interest between the unitholders and shareholders. This explains thevarious corporate governance and audit committee requirements which we have placed which go somewhat beyond what the normal Companies Actrequirements do.</p><p></p><p> It will be a little onerous for small companies. Mr Ongis right. But I think it will typically be large companies running infrastructure businesses that will avail themselves of this new business structure and this new legislation. Smaller businesses, if they wish to run business trusts, can always offer units in the business trust to accredited institutional investors; in other words, non-retail investors and they will not be bound by the requirements of the Business Trusts Bill. So that opportunity is there.</p><p></p><p> Both Mr Ong and Mr Andy Gan have raised the issue of creditors' rights. It is a very important issue. We are not going to deviate from the trust law position on creditors' rights. The trust law position<p align=left>Column: 381<p> will continue to apply to business trusts. We have received comments from various parties during the consultations, both for and against this position. We have decided that we should stick with this position - the trust law position will apply. It means that creditors can be repaid from the assets of the business trust provided the trustee-manager has not acted in breach of trust in incurring the liability.</p><p></p><p> Australia and Canada also have not departed from trust law in this regard. In the UK, there have been some discussions as part of their corporate law review but there has been no change implemented as yet.</p><p></p><p> Mr Ong is right that creditors will have the added responsibility of verifying whether the trustee-manager is acting in breach of trust and, consequently, whether creditors can claim the assets of the business trust. This is something that creditors will have to do. It is, of course, open to the sponsoring entity of the trustee-manager to provide some form of guarantee to creditors, if necessary. The loan agreement can contain such guarantees so as toprovide some further assurance to creditors. But we would not want to depart, at this point, from the basic positionin trust law that you can only claim the assets of the business trust if the trustee-manager had, in the first instance, acted in good faith and without breach of trust in incurring liability.</p><p></p><p> We are also a little wary of departing from this position because it could encourage creditors to be complacent in performing their due diligence checks, and the trust property may be diminished by such creditors' claims to the detriment of unitholders.</p><p></p><p> In response to Mr Andy Gan's specific question, creditors would not have rights that go beyond what is provided for currently under trust law. That is the other side of the coin.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 382<p><p> Mr Andy Gan had also raised the issue of penalties being a little high under the Business Trusts Bill. MAS has revised the penalties in all the Acts that it administers - the Securities and Futures Act, the Financial Advisers Act and so on not very long ago. In fact, they were revised upward substantially. Some of these penalties in the Bill may look a little higher than Members are familiar with but they are in line with all the other Acts that MAS now administers. They are not particularly high. For instance, if Members look at breach of duty by a trustee-manager, the penalty is $100,000. I would say that it is meaningful enough but it is not so onerous as to deter people from going into the business of running business trusts.</p><p></p><p> Mr Andy Gan had also asked about advisory committees and appeals procedures. The details of appeals procedures will be set out in the regulations that MAS will release and names of appeal panel members, which he had asked about, will be made public.</p><p></p><p> Mrs Fang Ai Lian had several suggestions on how we could further develop the capital markets including REITs. Mr Ong Kian Min had also specifically</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>mentioned the market for bonds, including listed bonds, and I agree with their observations that these are instruments worth developing. They add diversity and depth to our capital markets. MAS is promoting both these instruments. In the bond market,we are working very hard trying to promote a diversity of borrowers, both local and foreign, government and non-government, multi-lateral agencies as well -even the African Development Bankhas raised funds inSingapore. We will continue to do this through road shows, through the investment banks as well as on our own. MAS is going out with the industry to market the Singapore Dollar bond market. As it develops greater liquidity, I think you will find that there will be greater<p align=left>Column: 383<p> incentives for corporates to participate in the bond market. And the growth of the corporate bond market has been quite significant in the last two years.It has been much faster than the growth in other funding instruments. So we will continue to do this.<p></p><p> The tax position on REITs, if they choose to register under the Business Trusts Act, will be no different from what it is for other business trusts. In other words, the fact that they are REITs and they can alternatively be registered as a collective investment scheme will not change the tax treatment if they register as a business trust. So, REITs have a choice as to where they want to register. If they register under the Business Trusts Act, they will not be able to use the name \"REITs\" and they will be subject to the tax treatment that appliesto all business trusts. In other words, they will be taxed at the corporate rate, at the trustee level, and distributions of the trust would be treated as exempt one-tier dividends in the hands of unitholders. I am sure the Minister for Finance heard Mrs Fang Ai Lian'sarguments and will consider them. But the position at this point remains quite clear.</p><p></p><p> Mr Speaker, I think I have covered the main points that were raised by the three speakers.

However, now section 282C(1)(a) of the Bill will require business trusts offered to retail investors to be registered under the Business Trusts Bill and therefore subject to a governance framework which seeks to safeguard investors' rights and establish the duties and accountability of trustees and their directors.</p><p><br><I>Amendment to the definition of securities</I></p><p><br>The definition of \"securities\" in the Securities and Futures Act will be amended to include units and derivatives of units in a business trust so that the provisions under the Securities and Futures Act relating to securities will also apply to business trusts, including provisions relating to market conduct.

This is to ensure a fair and orderly market for take-overs of business trusts.</p><p><br><I>Regulatory treatment of property trusts</I></p><p><br>Property trusts or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as they are more commonly known, are currently regulated as collective investment schemes (CIS) under the Securities and Futures Act. Property trusts fall within both the collective investment scheme and business trust regimes. Rather than prescribe a specific approach, the Bill will allow a listed property trust to choose to be structured and regulated as either a collective investment schemeor a business trust. To avoid confusion to investors, any property trust regulated as a business trust will be prohibited from being referred to as a \"Real Estate Investment Trust\".</p><p><br><I>Conclusion<br></I></p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the capital markets are constantly innovating and the regulatory framework must respond.

Prof. Ho Peng Kee)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p><I>Introduction</I></p><p> Sir, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (CLTPA) was enacted on 21st October 1955. Since then, Parliament has extended it 10 times. The last time was five years ago in 1999. The Act will expire on 20th October this year. This Bill seeks to extend the Act for another five years. The Bill also amends the Act to provide for the taking of body samples for DNA profiling of persons arrested, detained or placed on police supervision under the Act.</p><p><I>Need for the Act</I></p><p> Sir, five years ago, I informed this House of the improved secret society (SS) and drug situation and asked \"Does it therefore mean that we do not need the Act anymore?\" Sir, the answer I gave, which the House endorsed by passing the Bill, was a clear \"No\". Over the past five years, the SS and drug situation has continued to improve considerably. But, my answer today is still an emphatic \"No\". Though suppressed, secret society activities and violence still rear its ugly head in Singapore. Let me highlight a few examples to illustrate how the Act has proven to be effective against secret societies, syndicated criminal activities as well as drug trafficking.</p><p align=left>Column: 388<p><p><I>Secret societies/triads</I></p><p> Sir, in April last year, arising from an earlier dispute, members of one secret society attacked a member from another secret society. One person was fatally stabbed. In another incident, in the year 2002, rioting between members of two secret societies resulted in a 21-year old man being stabbed to death.</p><p><I>Extortion and protection rackets</I></p><p> In 2001, members of a secret society operated a protection racket to extort money from operators of KTV lounges and entertainment outlets in the vicinity of Joo Chiat Road, East Coast Road and Kallang Leisure Park. They confronted the lounge and pub managers demanding a monthly \"protection fee\" of $500. They also insisted that their gang members be hired as security officers in the outlets for $1,500a month. The operators had kept quiet for fear of reprisal.</p><p> CID crippled this gang and arrested 16 members of the \"protection racket\". Five of them were placed on Detention Orders (DOs) while the rest were placed on record by the Registrar of Societies or warned by CID.</p><p><I>Illegal moneylending syndicates</I></p><p> Another syndicated activity that is dealt with under the Act is illegal moneylending. In today's context, a typical unlicensed moneylending syndicate operates in various parts of Singapore. The syndicate adopts different aliases in its moneylending activities to evade police detection. The \"Towkay\" or \"Boss\" operates behind the scene and engages \"office support staff\" and runners to assist in operating the illegal moneylending \"stalls\". Debtors who default on their payments are harassed by the runners at their homes. The usual intimidation, I think as many of us would know on the ground,tactics include <p align=left>Column: 389<p>smashing of flower pots and splashing of soil or paint on debtors' doors.</p><p> Routine police operations usually only result in frontline syndicate members being arrested and prosecuted in court for their illegal moneylending offences. The \"Towkays\" who are leaders operating behind the scene, earn big bucks but they go unpunished.</p><p> Syndicate members would not testify against the \"Towkay\" for fear of reprisal. These syndicate leaders continue to expand their operations and perpetuate their nefarious activities with impunity by recruiting new members to replace those arrested and prosecuted. Instead of letting them go unpunished, we have to deal with them under the CLTPA.</p><p><I>Triad and organised criminal gangs in the region</I></p><p> Furthermore, Singapore is vulnerable to infiltration by triads and organised criminal gangs from countries, such as Hong Kong, China, Japan and Malaysia. These East Asian Gangs or \"EAGs\" are driven by profit and have no qualms about committing cross-border crimes if the opportunity arises. We must therefore be constantly on guard.</p><p> Singapore has succeeded in keeping itself free from triad-related problems faced by some of our neighbouring countries. A key factor that has deterred EAGs from locating their activities here is the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, working in synergy with our tough laws, effective enforcement actions and a non-corrupt government.</p><p><I>Drug trafficking</I></p><p> Another area where the CLTPA is indispensable is drug trafficking. Drug trafficking is an extremely lucrative trade. Drug traffickers and syndicate leaders have become very sophisticated in their<p align=left>Column: 390<p> modus operandi. They deviously stay clear from the actual drug transactions and activities themselves. Instead, couriers, organisers and recruiters are engaged to conduct the business.</p><p> Allowing the Act to lapse may be misinterpreted as a softening of our tough stance and a weakening of our resolve or ability to deal with drug trafficking. This would be a wrong signal to send and may encourage international drug trafficking syndicates to use Singapore as a staging point for their illicit drug activities. More drugs will then find their way to the local population, resulting in higher \"contamination\" levels.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>We should not expose ourselves to this possibility.<p></p><p> In short, Sir, secret society, syndicated crimes and drug trafficking activities have declined considerably and are under control. However, the possibility of resurgence is always there. We, therefore, still need the strong deterrence offered by the Act.</p><p></p><p><I>Built-in safeguards</I></p><p></p><p> Having explained why the Act is still necessary today, let me assure Members that there are adequate safeguards incorporated into the Act as well as built into the administrative procedures to ensure that endorsement agencies do not abuse their powers and resort to using the Act without the strongest justification.</p><p></p><p> First, any proposal by police or CNB to detain a person under the Act or to place him under police supervision will be scrutinised by senior officials and the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Attorney-General's Chambers before a Detention or Police Supervision Order is issued. In fact, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Attorney General himself must give their consent. So, departments cannot take the easy way out. They must justify why <p align=left>Column: 391<p>they recommend using the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.</p><p></p><p> Second, an Advisory Committee comprising prominent private citizens, such as Justices of the Peace, senior lawyers and community leaders, scrutinise the investigations and documentary evidence and may examine detainees, investigation officers and witnesses. At the Committee's hearing, detainees may be represented by legal counsel. The Committee subsequently makes its recommendation to the President.</p><p></p><p> Third, Detention Orders are reviewed annually by a separate Review Committee, also comprising prominent private citizens. Members of the Review Committee are distinct from the Advisory Committee, ensuring independent decision making. Any recommendation to extend detention for a further 12-month period must also be approved by the President.</p><p></p><p> Fourth, a separate Review Board, also with a different set of members, will consider all cases of detention extending beyond 10 years. This process ensures that cases where persons have been detained beyond 10 years are specially scrutinised to determine that they have not been detained longer than necessary.</p><p></p><p> Finally, coming before Parliament every five years to renew this Act is an additional safeguard to ensure the Act is still needed in view of changing circumstances, and that it is being applied properly.</p><p></p><p> Once again, let me assure this House that, where there are witnesses willing to testify in court, we will definitely charge the culprits in court. But where victims and accomplices refuse to testify in open court, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act prevents the mastermind<p align=left>Column: 392<p> and syndicate leader from getting away scot-free to enjoy their ill-gotten gains. Even when invoked, the Act is not used as a blunt instrument. Depending on the gravity of the offence, either a Detention Order or a Police Supervision Order can be issued.</p><p></p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, let me now touch on another key amendment to the Act, which is to provide for the taking of body samples for DNA profiling of persons arrested, detained or placed on police supervision under the Act.</p><p></p><p> With advancement in technology, DNA profiling is widely used in forensic investigations in many countries. It has become an important tool in solving crimes. Each individual has a unique genetic DNA information. The chances of two persons in the world sharing the same DNA profile are in the region of one in 250 billion.</p><p></p><p> The Registration of Criminals Act (RCA) was amended in 2002 to provide for the establishment of a DNA database of criminals convicted in court for registrable offences. The Singapore Police Force DNA database became operational in February 2003 and was officially launched in July this year. But, in fact, police has been using DNA forensics from as early as 1991. Back then, DNA testing was largely confined to the direct matching of a suspect's DNA profile with that collected at the crime scene. The new DNA database, however, comprises both the offenders' DNA profiles as well as DNA profiles recovered from crime scenes. This is particularly useful in pinning down repeat offenders as their DNA profiles are matched against DNA profiles collected from crime scenes.</p><p></p><p> Detainees and supervisees under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act have been known to be involved in other<p align=left>Column: 393<p> crimes. A check on those issued with detention and supervision orders from 1994 to 2003 showed that 60% of them were found to have conviction records. Hence, this amendment will ensure that our DNA database is more comprehensive and, in turn, it will help improve intelligence and focus investigative efforts for more effective crime solving.</p><p></p><p> Sir, take, for example, a case last year where the glass door to an office was shattered and several items were stolen. Three bloodstains were found at the scene and the DNA was analysed. Several months later, the DNA profile from the bloodstains were found to match that of a prisoner who was serving sentence in prison for another offence then. Without the DNA database, the offender might have gone unpunished for the crimes he committed.</p><p></p><p> It is, therefore, timely and essential to provide for the taking of body samples for DNA profiling for persons arrested, detained or placed on police supervision under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.</p><p></p><p> Sir, I beg to move.</p><p></p><p> Question proposed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</B> Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.<p></p><p> It is called the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, but it has been with us since 1955. I think it is older than most of us and it gives a new meaning to the word \"temporary\". So, I wonder, first of all, why is it that we cannot call a spade a spade and call it the Criminal Law Preventive Detention Act?</p><p></p><p> Sir, there is a common principle of justice that no man should be imprisoned without an open trial, no man should be imprisoned without the chance to face his<p align=left>Column: 394<p> accusers in court, listen to the evidence against him and to challenge it. But we live in difficult times, and preventive detention is now seen more of a necessity, maybe a necessary evil, than not to have it at all. In fact, it is interesting to note that even in liberal countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, after 9/11 attack, they were compelled to provide legislation for preventive detention, but they use it mainly against terrorism, for which we have the Internal Security Act.</p><p></p><p> Sir, this Bill comes before us for an extension for another five years and it is to be strongly supported. But we must be careful. Public confidence will be eroded if we use preventive detention too freely, and it is very reassuring to hear from the Senior Minister of State that there are safeguards and checks in place to make sure that the power to order a preventive detention is carefully constrained. However, there is a question as to why we cannot have a schedule perhaps listing down the serious crimes of which the Senior Minister of State has mentioned, eg, drug trafficking, even human trafficking, syndicated crime, secret societies. Why can we not have a scheduled list of offences where this particular Act should apply? Why is this necessary? I think it would be good for the public in Singapore and for Members of this House to know the limits of this law, that preventive detention is seen more as an exception rather than the rule. Public confidence will be better if we can say that only in certain instances where it is absolutely necessary that we will have this Preventive Detention Order in place.</p><p></p><p> Sir, having made these comments, I do hope that we will be able to see less of the crimes that the Senior Minister of State has mentioned and, of course, at the end of the day, the presence of this particular piece of legislation is definitely a deterrence to all those who wish to come<p align=left>Column: 395<p> here and think that they can beat the system, as the Senior Minister of State has said, by avoiding open trials. I think it is a very good Act to support, and I strongly support it.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 395<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Deputy Leader of the House (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,<p></p><p> That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today beexempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 395<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS) (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> Debate resumed.<p></p><p>5.10 pm</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has been in our legislative books for a long time. But over the years, as a child, NSman and lawyer, I have come into contact with many people who have been detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. I remember, as a child, in the neighbourhood where I lived, there were many gangs and gang members who used to thrive. Slowly, word got around about the famous section 55 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act and, surely and certainly, over a period of time, we slowly saw them disappear. We also saw peace and security returning to our neighbourhoods. In the course of my National Service as a Police National Serviceman, I also came across many of these secret society personnel who used to intimidate businesses, individuals and many others whom they can intimidate in order to control territory or to raise money for themselves or for their group. As a <p align=left>Column: 396<p>lawyer, I also came across instances where individuals have been detained and when I think that they have been rightfully detained under the Act for some of the acts that they had carried out in the course of their gang or other related activities.<p></p><p> Sir, while I am assured by the Minister's information to this House that the number of persons who have been detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act has come down - I think that is a very welcome sign - I, for one, will certainly support the continuation of this Act for the simple reason, not so much for the number of people we have detained over the years, but the many more whom we have deterred from entering into these triad gangs, drug trafficking or any other form of major criminal activities where they think they can bluff our legal system.</p><p></p><p> Sir, there are many types of international syndicates, eg, the mafias, the yakuzas and the triad gangs referred to by the Minister as the EA gangs. I, for one, in the course of my conversation with many people, have heard that many of them have come to scout around in Singapore to look at criminal opportunities in Singapore. But when they realise that we have a law which allows them to be detained if they indulge in these activities because we are unable to get witnesses, I think it has deterred many more. And that is the major benefit of this Act and, because of that, I would support the continuation and the extension of this Act.</p><p></p><p> What I am equally impressed is that the detainees are given a fair hearing and are fairly treated. I have met members who have served on the Committee, and I can inform the House that many of them are people who would like to see that these people who are detained have a fair hearing. They look through the investi-<p align=left>Column: 397<p>gation papers,call upon the investigation officers to satisfy themselves that these detainees are indeed detained under the proper conditions laid down in the Act.</p><p></p><p> But, more importantly, Sir, what I would like to see is how can we reintegrate these detainees into society much better when they have servedtheir detention period. Are we doing enough to allow them to reintegrate into society by getting jobs faster or help them in any way to upgrade their skills or education so that they are able to integrate into society?</p><p></p><p> The other provision that is important here is the taking of the DNA samples under the new proposed amendments. What I would like to ask the Minister is: in cases where DNA samples are taken from those who are detained and who are subsequently released because of a lack of evidence or for some other reason, how can we conduct the process in a very transparent manner whereby the person who was wrongfully detained feels that his records or DNA samples are not kept in any way in any record in any form?</p><p></p><p> On that note, Sir,I support the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act was passed in October 1955. It is an Act to make temporary provisions for the maintenance of public order, the control of supplies by sea to Singapore and the preventionof strikes and lockouts in essential services which include banking, broadcasting, electricity, gas, immigration, newspapers, port, dockand harbour, postal and telecommunications, prison, public transport and air transport, securities and futures contracts, water, Singapore Armed Forces, Monetary Authority of Singapore and customs services -just to name afew.<p></p><p align=left>Column: 398<p><p> In fact, surprisingly, all these are found in this particular Act. This original intention has been expanded to detain subversive elements involved in criminal activities like secret society and drug trafficking activities. This Bill proposes to extend the period of validity of this Act for another five years, from 21st October 2004.</p><p></p><p> Parliament has been doing this every five years as my colleagues in Parliament have stated, for some time now. It has extended this Act, like the Senior Minister of State said,10 times for 50 years. Perhaps it is time to consider whether to make it a permanent law, or to repeal it, and have this statute in a form similar to other statutes. The name \"temporary provisions\" is unsuitable and is a misnomer.This statute has been in existence almost permanently for the last 50 years. Why not just call it Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act or, as Prof. Chin suggested, Criminal Law (Preventive Detention) Act, without a need for extending the validity period?</p><p></p><p> Section 27A gives police officers or officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau much wider powers against arrested person, including the power to take or cause to be takenphotographs and finger impressions, make records of the registrable particulars and any other particulars of such person and cause body samples of such person to be taken, send any photograph,finger impression, record of particulars or body sample so taken or madeto the Commissioner of Police for identification and report. Section 27A also gives these officers powers to do the above, even though the person has not really been convicted but only arrested or detained. There may not be a trial in the court of law under this Act. I would therefore caution that stringent measures be taken and that checks and balances be put in place so that there is no injustice done to arrest the person. A person arrested or detained has little choice <p align=left>Column: 399<p>because, under section 27A(3), if he fails without reasonable excuse to comply with the submission to the taking of his photographs and finger impressions or provide such registrable particulars or submit to the taking of his body samples by an authorised person, then that person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on conviction, to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or to both. So, he has got no choice. And a police officer or an officer of the CNB may use such force as is reasonably necessary to take or cause to be taken the photographs,finger impressions and body samples of that person.</p><p></p><p> Section 27B talks abouta police officer who hasreceived training for the above purpose. It is important therefore that proper training is conducted by competent persons and experts in this field as all these affect the liberty and privacy of our citizens. There must be a fair balance of individual rights as compared to public interest and to comply with the fundamental liberties provided for under the Constitution of Singapore.</p><p></p><p> Section 27C(3), Sir, is fair and balanced and is most welcome. It deals with any photograph, finger impression, record of particulars or body sample that has been taken under section 27A from an arrested person and that person is subsequently released, without being convicted of any offence under this Act, or placed on detention or supervision under this Act. Then the Commissioner of Police shall remove these items from the register and DNA database maintained under this section. As my colleague, Mr Ravindran has mentioned, the public must be confident thatthese records are removed and there are no traces left with the authorities.</p><p></p><p> Section 27C(4) creates a greater burden on accused persons. Information <p align=left>Column: 400<p>in the register and DNA database and any certificate or report made from that informationare admissible in evidence in court if produced from proper custody and authenticated by the signature of the Commissioner and is <I>prima facie</I> proof of the matters contained therein or appearing thereof. This is a liberal approach, Sir, in favour of the prosecution, as compared to the normal burden and standard approved required under our Evidence Act. So this is something to be looked into too.</p><p></p><p> Sir, there must be transparency, checks and balances and also proper supervision and control. It is important to have prevention of misuse by persons in authority and respect for confidentiality and secrecy. Therefore, in passing this Bill, I hope that the enforcement agencies will take note of the points that have been raised here. I would also like to add that I am involved in this Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. I have served in the Committee for more than 15 years and on that, I can safely say that there are good and very effective safeguards. But having said that, I think it is also important to review this particular statute to see if a better form could be made out.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this subject.<p></p><p> I appreciate what the Senior Minister of State has explained, in terms of the rationale for introducing such a Bill, and how it is coming up again for review after five years. While I support the Bill, I have a few questions pertaining particularly to the DNA aspect of it. I bring this upin particular reference to the younger people whom he hasidentified earlier on as runners.</p><p></p><p> Firstly, we do know that police investigations involve a certain degree of coercion and persuasion. In this particular aspect, I wonder how the younger runners - they are not yet offenders - or their<p align=left>Column: 401<p> parents are persuaded to give consent for a DNA sampling. I ask this because some of them could have made a mistake earlier and the DNA profiling continues for the rest of their lives. They may have even turned over a new leaf in due course. How would this DNA profiling follow them through?With that, I would like to tie up what Prof. Chin Tet Yung brought up earlier. Wouldit not be better to have a two-tier scheme of offences? Because the DNA profiling is very potent and when it comes to the younger persons, there must be a second chance given to them especially when certain offences are committed when they are young.</p><p></p><p> The second point has already been mentioned byMr Ravindran and Mr Chandra Mohan. If the person is found not to be guilty, how is the DNA record expunged from his personal record? How is that scheme or method told to the individual? What is the level of reassurance that we, as citizens, can have, when we know that the DNA profile is destroyed?</p><p></p><p> These aremy two questions and I hope I can get some clarifications.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</B> First, let me thank all the four speakers for making the points that they have made, which gives me an opportunity to elaborate further on the Bill and, in particular, to thank Mr Ravindran and Prof. Chin who strongly support the Bill. Of course, I note that Mr Chandra Mohan and Ms Braema Mathi also see the need for the Bill and, indeed, the personal experience of Mr Mohan in sharing about how over the years he has found the safeguards of the committeeto be somethingvery real. I think that is a very good sharing at a personal level.<p></p><p> First, let me take the point about the offences under the Bill. I think that is an important point. As I have said in my speech, the requirement and the common<p align=left>Column: 402<p>thread under which offences fall within theBill are situations where witnesses fear to testify because of reprisal, and that is a key point. And I havealso given the assurance that where we can prosecute, we will prosecute because the court process inopen court is the norm. And that is indeed a core principle ofour legal system. But as all the speakers have said, there are situations where, particularly,syndicates are involved. So that if you have witnesses to come and testify against that person who goes in, there are peopleoutside especially underlings, who will harasshim, his family members and people who know him. That is a real fear. We should take it from that perspective and also from the fact that we have operated this Act for,as all of you have said, almost 40 years. And each time we come to the House, every five years, we explain why the Act is necessary in the context of the situations that have arisen and, therefore, Singaporeans know that we use the CLTPA for offences such as secret societies andgangs that are involved. We have also been tackling money-lending syndicates with the CLTPA and, in particular, drug trafficking syndicates.</p><p></p><p> I would say,let us give the Minister that flexibility, but always on the core principle whereby court prosecution is the norm and the basis upon which the Act is invoked is when witnesses fear to testify. That, in fact, is a common thread becauseas Members in this House - Mr Mohan and one or two other lawyers -who sit on the Criminal Law Advisory Committee know,it is an elaborate process where, in order to justify a detention, whether it isthe CNB or police, they have to build up and establish a case, more often than not, including witnesses' statements and listing out all the activities that have taken place and then making a convincing case not just to the Minister, who ultimately decides, but also the Permanent Secretary and Attorney-General.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 403<p><p> This, plus the fact that the Act is used sparingly and indeed over the years, the number of criminal law detainees has come down. Last year, it was 211. The last time when I came to this House in 1999when we renewed it - the figure given (for 1998) was 463. And before that, in 1988, it was 1,260. The fact is that the Act is not used willy-nilly, nor used as a substitute for court prosecution, but only when the grounds justify it. The fact that it is used sparingly, and the safeguards that all of us have shared in this House are effective, would keep public confidence highas to, firstly, why the Act is needed and, secondly, the correct and justified use of the Act.</p><p></p><p> I think Mr Ravindran isspot-on when he said that the Act is a strong deterrent especially against foreign triads who may be surveying the land. We know that foreign triads are very opportunistic, they are quite mobile, they are very pragmatic and they go where the money is. Here is another reason why we should not circumscribe the use of the Act but give the Minister the flexibility which this Government, current Ministers and all Ministers before - have and will not abuse.</p><p></p><p> The second point is the renaming of the Act. This is an interesting point why we have a temporary provisions Act that has lasted now 50 years, and previous officer holdershave come to this House10 times - not me,I have come twice - to argue for its renewal.I think there are basically three reasons. First is, what I have alluded to earlier,the educational effect of coming to this House -having to explain that beneath the calm of Singapore, we do have bad elements,not just normal criminals,but in particular criminals, syndicates, sometimeswith foreign links, who will want to destroy our safety and security. So when young Singaporeansread about this, they will<p align=left>Column: 404<p> realise that, yes, Singapore's safety and security cannot be taken for granted. We have a whole plethora of weapons inour arsenal, key of which is the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act.</p><p></p><p> The second one is that it is a reminder to all of us when we come to this House every five years that what we are doing when we invoke the Act - I think Prof. Chin mentioned that -is not the norm. The norm is court prosecution. And it is also a reminder to our officials out there, the law enforcement agencies, that when they want to invoke the Act, they must adhere to all safeguards. They must not abuse the easewith which they think, or some may think ormay be tempted to think theysecure detention. I am not saying any of them think this way, but it is also a reminder that they must not take this avenue too easily.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> The third one of course is the check. Because Parliament has to approve this Act every five years,Members would have the opportunity to say, \"No, I do not want to renew it\". So the Minister has to come here and explain to the House, give youthe situation, cite the figures to show that, yes, we still do need the Act. Hence, coming to the House every five years has a salutary effect. So let us keep to that.<p></p><p> The next point relates to integration. Mr Ravindran talks about integration of ex-detainees. This is the same issue that confronts ex-prisoners. It is a wider issue as to how Singaporeans, in particular employers, take to employing ex-detainees or ex-prisoners. But Mr Ravindran would be cheered to hear that the recidivism rate of criminal law detainees is actually lower than convicted prisoners. So we are absolutely right that in terms of the salutary effect on people who go in and come out, it does remind them that having spent time inside and having come out, they do grasp the opportunity of freedom very carefully.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 405<p><p align=\"center\">[<B>MrDeputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching)in the Chair</B>]</p><p></p><p>5.38 pm</p><p></p><p> The last big point is onDNA. Ms Braema Mathi, Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Ravindranhave mentionedthis new process. First of all, let me say, Sir, that the process is not new. AsI have said, DNA testing has been used since 1991 but that was more in terms of matching what is collected at the crime scene with suspects' DNA. In 2002, we moved amendments to the Registration of Criminals Act to start collecting a database. We had studied the experiences of other countries such as theUK which was the first to start a DNA database in 1995. The officials actually went around toother countries. They visited US and Canada to learn from the experience of other countries before embarking on our own.The database became operational in February 2003. Since then, one and a half years later, we have collected 38,000 profiles in our database. So really we are just building on this experience.</p><p></p><p> Let me say that it is not to the advantage of anybody to be callous about how DNA is taken. If you look at the Bill, the amendment to theRegistration of Criminals Act taken by the Minister in2002, we elicitated all the safeguards, which include, eg, the obtaining of consent from, in this case, the detainee. If the method of taking the body sample is by blood, because it is intrusive, invasive, consent is needed. But if it is by buckle swab or by hair follicle, consent is not needed.Here again, the method of taking bloodis a simple process. It is a prick whichall of us go through duringa medical test,wherea lancetis used to take the blood. So it is not a terribly difficult or painful process. And the experience of my officers in taking<p align=left>Column: 406<p> 38,000 samples is that there has been no problem.</p><p></p><p> But in theprocess itself, care is taken to ensure that the sample taken remains pure and not contaminated. That includes, eg,wearing gloves, ensuringthe identification is properly done with unique bar code system, to ensure that having taken the blood sample on the form, it is sealed in a foil, put in a locked box and transported to HSA, and in HSAthe chain of integrity of the process is also maintained, because only certain people would have access to it. So the assurance I could give is, having worked this system, it is a system that will pass muster by public confidence. And, it must be so, because it is not to the advantage of anybody for any wrong profiling and a wrong matching to be effected, when the real criminal is still out there.</p><p></p><p> Ms Braema Mathi talks about the young detainee. We work on the principle that every detainee for whom detention is justified would have to be profiled. But age is just one factor taken into account by the officials and the committee in deciding whether it should be a Detention Order or a Police Supervision Order. So the assurance here would be that if he is a first-timer, a young person, then there is a better chance of him being put on a Police Supervision Order rather than a Detention Order.</p><p></p><p> The last point iswhether the record, when it is deleted, an assurance could be given for the deletion. The capturing of the record is by electronic means. So it is not a matter of returning anything to the detainee.The assurance I can give is that the integrity of the system is at stake. So when the law says that the records should be destroyed, there is really no need to tell the person his records would be destroyed, because if he is detained but no case has been made out against him and he is let off, the law mandates<p align=left>Column: 407<p> that his records would be destroyed. That is the assurance that we can give, that our law enforcement officers will follow and do follow the law.</p><p></p><p> Question put, and agreed to.</p><p></p><p> Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p></p><p> The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].</p><p></p><p> Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL--><p align=left>Column: 407<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>BUILDING CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> Order for Second Reading read.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<p></p><p><I>Building Control (Amendment) Bill</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, on several occasions in Parliament this year I raised concern over the danger posed by falling windows. The incidence of falling windows has increased dramatically in the last four years - from 19 cases in 2000 to 106 cases in 2003. Despite the increased publicity and effort to raise public awareness, I am afraid the situation has not improved. Another 65 incidents of fallen windows were reported in the first six months of this year. We have been lucky so far that no one had been seriously injured or even killed by any such falling window. We have to take further steps to curb the danger to lives that are posed by dislodged windows and, for that matter, by air-conditioners, tiles or any other external parts of buildings which fall from a height, especially in our predominantly high-rise environment. My Ministry, therefore, <p align=left>Column: 408<p>proposes to amend the Building Control Act to address upstream the design and installation of exterior features of buildings, including windows, and I would now elaborate on the proposed amendments in greater detail.</p><p></p><p><I>A general legislative framework</I></p><p></p><p> This Bill proposes to amend the Building Control Act to provide a general legislative framework for theMinister to prescribe minimum performance standards of installation and to order the retrofitting of specific exterior features of buildings to meet these standards. \"Exterior features\" are those that are either permanently installed on, or form part of, or project outwards from the roof or exterior of a building. These include windows, air-conditioner units, claddings and curtain walls.</p><p></p><p><I>Order to retrofit</I></p><p></p><p> Part III of the current Act, containing detailed provisions for the installation and retrofitting works for air-conditioning units, will be repealed. It will be replaced by a provision to enable the Minister to make orders, where necessary, for the \"person responsible\" to retrofit specific exterior features of buildings to the minimum standards within a grace period.</p><p></p><p> This new provision will not apply to:</p><p></p><p> a) The exterior features installed in landed properties within private compounds, as they are not accessible to the public; and</p><p></p><p> b) The exterior features installed on the lowest level of a building, in other words, the ground floor in most cases, as they do not pose danger to public safety.</p><p></p><p> The detailed legislation for the installation and retrofitting of air-conditioning units will be moved to the Building Control Regulations.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 409<p><p>\"<I>Person responsible</I>\"</p><p></p><p> Sir, the Bill specifies the \"person responsible\" for the prescribed exterior features as someone who has charge of their maintenance or daily control. This means the owners of all buildings/premises, except in the following situations:-</p><p></p><p> a) Where the exterior features are part of the common property of a HDB flat, the Minister will designate HDB or the relevant Town Council to be responsible for the installation/retrofitting of each regulated exterior feature. In general, if the exterior feature is installed by the Town Council, it would be the responsibility of the Town Council to retrofit the feature, should the need arise. For example, estate block number signages and additional decorative roof features.</p><p></p><p> b) Where the exterior features are part of the common property of a strata development, the Management Corporations (MCs) involved would be responsible as they have charge over their maintenance.</p><p></p><p> Where windows, grilles and shutters are concerned, the owners of units have to be responsible for the proper installation of these items, as they would normally have charge over their use, maintenance and control. This includes the owners of commercial buildings, lessees of HDB flats, and subsidiary proprietors in condominium developments.</p><p></p><p><I>Authorised person/firm to carry out works</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, prescribing the standards for an exterior feature alone is not sufficient to ensure safety. We also need to ensure that the \"person responsible\" engages someone who is qualified to undertake the retrofitting or installation. The Bill, therefore, makes provision to allow the Minister to stipulate the required qualifications of the person/firm authorised to carry out such works.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 410<p><p><I>Penalty for non-compliance with retrofitting orders</I></p><p></p><p> Failure to comply with any retrofitting order will be an offence, liable to a maximum fine of $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both. To deter continuing non-compliance, a fine of $500 may be imposed on the \"person responsible\" for the exterior feature for each day that the offence continues after conviction.</p><p></p><p><I>Window legislation</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, upon this Bill being passed in Parliament, the Minister will prescribe the minimum standards for the design and installation of windows. All newly installed windows will have to meet the requirements in the Singapore Standard SS212 for Aluminum Alloy Windows. This is the current standard adopted by the industry.</p><p></p><p> Next, existing casement windows in residential buildings, fitted with aluminum rivets, will be required to be retrofitted with stainless steel rivets. Starting from 1st October this year, a 12-month grace period will be granted for the retrofitting exercise. Windows that have been installed for 5 years or more will have to be retrofitted.</p><p></p><p> The retrofitting requirement will apply only to existing casement windows in residential buildings. Non-residential buildings will be exempted. This is because most of the reported cases of fallen windows involved casement windows of residential buildings. Non-residential buildings are normally maintained regularly to ensure that the buildings, including windows, are in good condition.</p><p></p><p> Notwithstanding the grace period or the exemptions, I strongly urge all owners<p align=left>Column: 411<p> to retrofit their windows as soon as possible, in the interest of public safety.</p><p></p><p> All installation and retrofitting of windows must be carried out by contractors approved by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA). BCA will register these approved contractors under the existing Contractor Registry System (CRS). We will make available the list of approved contractors to the public before 1st October this year. Nevertheless, if the residents wish to retrofit their windows before the legislation is made effective, they can obtain a list of HDB trained window contractors from their Branch Office or from HDB's Infoweb.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>These contractors have undergone the necessary training by HDB and are competent to carry out the retrofitting of windows.<p></p><p> To keep the retrofitting cost low, BCA and HDB will work with managing agents for private housing estates and Town Councils respectively to do en bloc retrofitting wherever possible.</p><p></p><p><I>Other amendments</I></p><p></p><p><I></I> Sir, apart from the amendments related to exterior features, my Ministry is also proposing other amendments to provide for more effective administration of the Building Control Act.</p><p></p><p><I>Periodic inspection of buildings</I></p><p></p><p><I></I> Currently, the Act requires owners of commercial buildings to carry out periodic inspections at 5-yearly intervals and residential buildings at 10-yearly intervals, after obtaining their Certificates of Statutory Completion (CSCs). The purpose of the inspections is to ensure that structural defects can be detected and rectified early, in order to keep our buildings structurally sound. This is<p align=left>Column: 412<p> especially important as our buildings age over time, and wear and tear start to set in.</p><p></p><p> However, some buildings may not obtain their CSCs for several years after obtaining their Temporary Occupation Permits (TOPs). Hence, the Bill proposes to amend the Act so that the first structuralinspection will be conducted at the specific number of years after obtaining the TOP or CSC, whichever is earlier.</p><p></p><p><I>Composition fine</I></p><p></p><p> The Building Control Act and the Building Control Regulations are aimed at protecting public safety. To provide greater deterrence against contravention of the Act and the Regulations, the Bill proposes to raise the cap on composition fine from $400 to $2,000.</p><p></p><p><I></I> Sir, in conclusion, this Bill will provide a framework for regulating upstream the design and installation of exterior features of buildings. Where necessary, the Minister will issue orders to require specific exterior features to be retrofitted to the required standards to ensure public safety.</p><p></p><p> However, I must stress that the owner needs to make the effort and continue to properly maintain these exterior features after they have been installed or retrofitted.</p><p></p><p>My Ministry will introduce provisions in the Building Maintenance and Management Bill that is currently being considered by a Select Committee, to require external features to be properly maintained.</p><p></p><p> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.</p><p></p><p> Question proposed.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 413<p>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.<p></p><p> In a high-rise and high-density built environment like Singapore,we must ensure that both building users and the general public are safe from objects falling from heights. The recent cases of falling windows from high-rise buildings have raised much safety concern among the general public. Over the last two years, more than 100 windows had fallen from high-rise buildings. We are fortunate that no fatality has occurred. Sir, the authorities must address this safety issue urgently; otherwise, there may be adverse consequences.</p><p></p><p> Sir, I support the Bill which aims to provide a framework for the regulation of specific exterior features on building facade which pose danger to the public if they should fall from a height. I also support that persons responsible for the maintenance or daily control of the specified exterior features should be held accountable if these features fall from heights. But the Bill falls short of taking a holistic approach in tackling the problem of falling objects from all high-rise buildings. Let me elaborate the shortcomings of the Bill.</p><p></p><p><I>(1)</I> <I>Prevention strategy</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, to prevent exterior features from falling from heights, we need to address the root of the problem. Why do exterior features such as windows, grilles, air-conditioning units, tiles, gutters, rainwater downpipes and various other features that are permanently installed on building facade fall from heights? There are five possible causes of such failures: (1) poor design; (2) poor construction; (3) poor maintenance; (4) poor usage; and (5) environmental factors such as wind, rain, ultra-violet light, earthquake and air pollution.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 414<p><p> In order to ensure that exterior features of buildings do not fall from heights, we need to adopt a prevention strategy. First, we should minimise the number of exterior features on the facades ofbuildings. Sir, in Singapore, we have far too many buildings with lots of exterior features such as cantilevered architectural features, hanging sun shades, protruding awnings, and extensive tile claddings on the facades of buildings.All these features are attributed to design. Thus, it is necessary for the proposed Bill to regulate the design of exterior features onfacades of buildings so as to reduce the chances of such features falling from heights.</p><p></p><p> Sir, if you observe the high-rise buildings in Tokyo, the external facade design is usually simple and easy to maintain with minimum exterior features. Instead of spending large sums of money onbuilding facades, their designers focus more on the interior design and comfort of its users. In Singapore, you cannot help but feel a littleunsafe when you walk in the housing estate or in the city area. Many of our buildings have extensive exterior features cantilevering or protruding over your head. I hope the Minister can explain why the authorities do not regulate the design of exterior features of buildings in Singapore so as to further enhance the safety of the public.</p><p></p><p> Sir, if a high-rise building is designed with lots of complex exterior features, it makes construction and maintenance difficult. As such, the quality of construction and maintenance of the exterior features will be affected. Who should be held responsible if such complex exterior features were to fall from heights? I believe the designers and contractors must be held accountable. This design and construction responsibility is not featured in the Bill. Can I ask the Minister whether architects and engineers should be held responsible for designing<p align=left>Column: 415<p> exterior features which are difficult to access for construction and maintenance?</p><p></p><p> Sir, although clause 11 of the Bill empowers the Minister to make regulations relating to the design and construction of exterior features and to regulate persons authorised to carry out installations or retrofitting of any exterior feature, it is not clear how this should be regulated. From the experience of maintenance personnel, the simplest solution to prevent exterior features from falling from heights is not to have any of such features on building facades.</p><p></p><p><I>(2) Due diligence offlat owners</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, while I agree thatflat owners should exercise more responsibility to keep their windows, grilles and shutters in a serviceable condition, there are problems relating to the exercise of due diligence on the part offlat owners. There is a general lack of information in the industry to help flat owners make informed decisions to select a qualified person or firm to install windows, grilles or shutters properly in their flats. The Building andConstruction Authority should exercise more stringent control to license these qualified persons or firms, and take effective enforcement action against firms which flout the rules.</p><p></p><p> To-date, the extensive sub-contracting system in the industry does not ensure quality installation of windows, grilles and shutters. There should be better traceability and accountability of such qualified persons and firms. Manyflat owners are laymen who do not understand the technicality of building materials and designs. Frankly speaking, not many flat owners would know the difference between using aluminum or stainless steel rivets for their windows, and its implications on the performance of the windows.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 416<p><p> Sir, I would like to commend the efforts of HDB in publishing a HDB Residents' handbook in November 2003 to educate its lessees on the maintenance and repair of various building components. I would urge BCA to do likewise for all other high-rise buildings in Singapore, especially with regard to the safe installation and maintenance of windows, grilles, shutters and air-conditioners.</p><p></p><p> At present, there is no clear regulatory guideline on how flat owners should maintain their windows and grilles. Technically speaking, windows, grilles and shutters are relatively maintenance free, except for periodic cleaning. Even window unit air-conditioners, if installed properly, can last many years. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether flat owners have exercised due diligence in maintaining their windows, grilles, shutters or air-conditioners.</p><p></p><p> Sir, the Bill also restricts the responsibility to HDB flat owners and subsidiary proprietors of strata title developments. I do not understand the rationale for omitting owners of high-rise commercial buildings, especially those in the city areas where public traffic is high. I would propose that all high-rise buildings should be covered under the Bill.</p><p></p><p><I>(3)</I> <I>Safe design of exterior features</I></p><p></p><p> Sir, instead of focusing on the responsibility of flat owners and maintenance organisations on exterior features, we should explore innovative approaches to improve the design of exterior features of buildings with better safety features. For example, movable windows or grilles and air-conditioners can be designed to have safety catches or cables to prevent them from falling from heights.</p><p></p><p> Precast concrete sunshades which are cast monolithic with the building structures should be used instead of fixing<p align=left>Column: 417<p> sunshades of different materials to building facades. We should avoid using tile claddings on building facades as they tend to delaminate due to poor bonding and thermal expansion. Rainwater downpipes should run inside instead of outside buildings to facilitate access for maintenance and prevention from falling from heights. Where possible, avoid plastering building facades which have high sunlight exposure as they tend to experience thermal expansion and cracks if poorly designed and installed.</p><p></p><p> Sir, to ensure the safety of public from falling exterior features of buildings, we must set safety performance standards for these features. Although the Singapore Standard SS212 prescribes specifications for the use of aluminum alloy windows, there is a lack of emphasis on the safe design of windows, grilles and shutters. To date, many exterior features are designed based on building standards overseas which may not be suitable in the local context.</p><p></p><p> I would urge the Ministry to introduce a comprehensive set of Singapore Standards for all specified exterior features as stated in the Bill under clause 2. In this way, designers and contractors can comply with these local standards to ensure better and safer performance of exterior features.</p><p></p><p> To further protect the public, we should design our buildings so as to channel pedestrian traffic at the ground level to covered walkways. This will reduce the chances of persons being injured by falling objects from heights.</p><p></p><p> Sir, the safety of public is of paramount importance with regard to this proposed Bill in regulating the exterior features of buildings. To achieve this, we need to ensure that future buildings in Singapore are designed with minimum or safe exterior features. We must also ensure that persons responsible for the safe performance of exterior features are <p align=left>Column: 418<p>able to exercise their responsibility diligently, and must exercise their responsibility to ensure the safety of the public.</p><p></p><p> To address this problem, we need to change the mindsets of qualified persons upstream in the building process.

But I do take his other comments concerning the general safety of public buildings, and I take that in the spirit in which it is given, and that is we need to look at it on a comprehensive basis. I cannot disagree with the fact that the problem is not just a matter of maintenance alone. It starts all the way<p align=left>Column: 419<p> from design, construction and, of course, maintenance, usage and, finally, environmental factors. We cannot do very much about earthquakes and high winds. I think we can take that into account when we design buildings, which is the first point he made.</p><p></p><p> But I would like to perhaps add a word of caution here in that we cannot be so prescriptive as to regulate the building industry or the qualified professionals to such an extent that we say that theycannot have exterior features or they can only have so many exterior features, etc. Do not forget that our problems are, as I said earlier, windows and air-conditioners.We have dealt with air-conditioners earlier.We are dealing with windows now. You cannot tell the designer not to include windows in his building. He has to put them somewhere. That is where our problem is. We have casement windows particularly that have not been properly installed andmaintained. But the fact is that you cannot fault the designer and the architect for actually designing windows at that particular point in timeto the standard of the day. Now that the standard has been changed,we are now requiringretrofitting. That is something that we have to do. But I submit, in all fairness, it is not the fault of the design professionals.</p><p></p><p> But, yes, the general point is correct.I agree that when somebody designs a building, it must be designed with safety in mind,with ease of maintenance in mind, andit must also be designedwith ease of construction in mind. I must say that this is part and parcel of the overall responsibility of the professionals. So, should Government regulatethe number of external features or minimise the number of external features? I do not think so. I think we leave it to the professionals, but put the onus on them to make sure that when they do design <p align=left>Column: 420<p>such things, that it is going to be properly designed, properly anchored and constructed. And, of course, we are now urging home owners, \"persons responsible\", to make sure that they are properly maintained.</p><p></p><p> Dr Teo also said that it is not fair to put the blame on flat owners who do not know the difference between aluminum and stainless steel rivets. Yes, I think we do need a lot more education of flat owners on how they can better maintain their flats. And this is the reason why HDB last year and together with PAP town councils this year are looking at maintenance manualswhich will better educate flat owners on how they can not only just better maintain windows but also generally maintain their flats and keep them in good condition. The other way, of course, is through regulation, which is what we are doing today. We want to have the regulations in place. And for regulations to be effective, we also need to have the clout andthe teeth, and this is the reason why there are provisions for fines and also custodial sentences, if necessary.</p><p></p><p> He asked why do we exempt owners of high-rise commercial buildings. In my Second Reading speech, Iexplained that generally the problem does not lie with them. Their buildings are regularly maintained. They do havemaintenance agents who actually maintain these buildings. That is the reason why the figure shows the overwhelming bulk of the cases of fallen windows actually comes from residential buildings and, to a large extent, from the HDB buildings.</p><p></p><p> Dr Teo mentioned about safe design. Yes, as I said earlier, definitely I agree that safety must be designed into the building and development. Should it also involve designing covered walkways? If it is necessary, of course. But I do not think we should require or mandate that everybody should be walking under<p align=left>Column: 421<p> shelter. Otherwise, we might as well live in a tunnel!</p><p></p><p> As far as safety standards are concerned, yes, there are already in place safety standards under SPRING. The building codes do specify safety standards. But where they are inadequate,we must, of course,endeavour to strengthen them. And this is one area where we have to update the building codes, specifically to SS212 for casement window rivets.</p><p></p><p> The last point that Dr Teo mentioned - I think this is a general point - is that qualified professionals (QPs) must exercise responsibility, there must be a mindset change, we must inculcate in them a sense of responsibility and that no amount of fines will do.In fact, I agree wholeheartedly with him. This is something that we have to keep on doing. No matter what legislation we put in place, no matter how much punitive measures we put into the legislation, there is no substitute for ultimately safety consciousness and the safety culturebeing inculcated and being part and parcel of all the people who are responsible in the industry.</p><p></p><p> With those remarks, I thank once again Dr Teo for his support. And I hope that with this Bill and the support of all home owners, we will be able to drastically improve public safety.</p><p></p><p>Question put, and agreed to.</p><p></p><p> Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.</p><p></p><p> The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.- [Mr Mah Bow Tan].<br></p><p></p><p> Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:HUMAN CLONING AND OTHER PROHIBITED PRACTICES BILL--><p align=left>Column: 422<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>HUMAN CLONING AND OTHER PROHIBITED PRACTICES BILL<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> Order for Second Reading read.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second time.\"<br><p></p><p><I>Concerns about cloning and stem cell research</I></p><p></p><p>Sir, stem cells are unspecialised cells. They are able to renew, proliferate or reproduce themselves. They are also able to specialise and differentiate into other type of cells with specialised functions. Because of this potential to become specialised cells, stem cell research may provide a cure for diseases like diabetes, dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, spinal cord injury and heart failure. When the stem cells are obtained from an embryo, they are known as embryonic stem cells. The embryonic stem cells may be obtained from human embryos created by in vitro fertilisation (IVF), by cloning techniques or from existing embryonic stem cell lines. Cloning techniques used to produce stem cells are referred to as therapeutic cloning techniques.</p><p></p><p> In 1997, the first successfully cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, was born. This was not an easy feat: Prof Ian Wilmut and his team had to make more than 270 attempts before they finally succeeded in cloning Dolly. Since then, scientists have cloned a number of other animal species but no one has yet managed to successfully clone a human being. But the potential to create a human clone exists. This form of cloning is called reproductive human cloning. Almost everyone believes human reproductive cloning should not be attempted for two reasons.</p><p></p><p> Firstly, the attempt to clone a human is very likely to give rise to many malformed babies before a seemingly <p align=left>Column: 423<p>normal baby is cloned. Dolly the sheep had premature ageing and died early. So even if a normal looking baby was successfully created by cloning, such a baby may have many defects.</p><p></p><p> Secondly, the cloning of identical copies of humans raises ethical and moral concerns that trouble most people.</p><p></p><p>In December 2000, the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) was appointed by Cabinet to examine the ethical, legal and social issues arising from biomedical research and development in Singapore, and to recommend policies to the Ministerial Committee for Life Sciences on these issues. In February 2001, the Human Stem Cell Research Sub-committee was formed under BAC to specifically deal with the ethical, legal and social issues arising from human stem cell research. The BAC made its recommendations on how stem cell research should be conducted in its report which was accepted by Cabinet in May 2002. The BAC recommended that there should be a complete ban on the implantation of a human embryo created by the application of cloning technology into a womb, or any treatment of a human embryo intended to result in its development into a viable infant. In other words, it recommended banning human reproductive cloning. This Bill will ban human reproductive cloning without stopping stem cell research that may provide cures for millions of people with diseases like diabetes and stroke.</p><p></p><p><I>Stem cell research</I></p><p></p><p> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a spectrum of views on stem cell research and therapeutic cloning. There will be no unanimous view on this subject and my Ministry recognises and respects the diversity of views. But in the area of human reproductive cloning, there is<p align=left>Column: 424<p> almost unanimous agreement from the international community, local scientific and religious groups as well as our general public that reproductive cloning of human beings is abhorrent and should not be allowed under any circumstances. This was supported by the feedback obtained by my Ministry during its public consultations on the draft version of this Bill.</p><p></p><p><I>Scope of Bill</I></p><p></p><p> This Bill prohibits human reproductive cloning. I think no one will disagree with this and so I hope that all Members, including those whomay be opposed to other aspects of human embryonic stem cell research, IVF or any kind of researchdealing with embryos, would agree to support this Bill which bans human reproductive cloning.</p><p></p><p> As issues that relate to stem cell research touch on the fundamental moral and religious beliefs of Members, I would like to ask for the Whip to be raised so that Members can vote for this Bill according to their conscience.</p><p><br><I>Provisions</I></p><p></p><p> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the overall intent of this Bill is very straightforward, that is, to ban</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>the cloning of a human being. However, the provisions in the Bill are technically complex as it is necessary to ensure that this Bill adequately addresses all the scenarios in which human reproductive cloning activities might take place. At the same time, we also need to make sure that the provisions do not inadvertently interfere with couples who are making use of Assisted Reproduction services and In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) programmes to have children.<p></p><p>I will now proceed to describe the main provisions in the Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Bill:</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 425<p><p> (a) Prohibition of implantation of any human clone. The key provision of this Bill is that it bans the placing of a human embryo clone into the body of a woman. This effectively prevents anyone from developing an embryo clone inside a human womb and delivering it after nine months as a live baby.</p><p><br> (b) Prohibition against developing embryos outside the body for more than 14 days. In order to prevent individuals from circumventing the first provision by developing human clones outside the human body, this Bill includes a provision that prohibits embryos created by any means from being developed outside of a woman's body for more than 14 days. This cut-off point of 14 days was recommended by the Bioethics Advisory Committee because it is at this time that the cells in the embryo begin to differentiate and start forming tissues. This 14-day rule is found in similar cloning legislation from countries such as Australia, Belgium, Japan and the UK.</p><p></p><p> (c)Prohibitions on certain uses of embryos. This provision is to ensure that no one would be allowed to undertake such abhorrent experiments as placing of human embryos into animals or placing animal embryos into the body of a human being.</p><p><br> (d) Prohibited embryos. This provision complements the earlier provision by ensuring that embryos that have been developed for more than 14 days outside the body of a woman should not be implanted into a womb. This does not include any period of time during which the embryo's development has been suspended, for example, when an embryo is frozen. The prohibition against implantation also extends to embryos that have been deliberately removed from a woman's body with the intention of collecting a viable embryo.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 426<p><p> (e) Prohibition against import and export of prohibited embryos. This Bill also prohibits the import and export of prohibited embryos so that researchers cannot collaborate with overseas parties in unethical cloning research activities. We do recognise that there may be situations where researchers may not be in a position to check or control the nature and age of the embryo being imported and so only those who knowingly import prohibited embryos will be liable to prosecution under this Bill.</p><p></p><p> (f) Prohibition of commercial trading in egg, sperm and embryo. The Bill also prohibits commercial trading in human eggs, sperms and embryos. This is prevented by outlawing the giving or receiving of valuable consideration for the supply of such items. Valuable consideration includes any inducement, such as money or gifts, as well as any discount or priority in the provision of a service to the donor. It does not include the payment of reasonable reimbursement, such as expenses incurred or the provision of services during the collection, storage or transport of the tissue.</p><p></p><p> (g)Penalties. The maximum penalty for offences under this Bill is a fine of $100,000, a 10-year jail term, or both. This is in line with the penalties in the UK legislation.</p><p></p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p></p><p>Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill prohibits what is considered unethical by everyone, that is, activities leading to the development of a human clone. I hope all Members will show their support for this Human Cloning and Other Prohibited Practices Bill as this will clearly demonstrate Singapore's commitment towards ethical and responsible biomedical research.</p><p></p><p>Sir, I beg to move.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 427<p><p> Question proposed.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> It is getting late.

Thank you for allowing me to participate in this debate.<p></p><p> The antecedent to this Bill, Sir, is the historic paper of November 1998 by American and Israeli scientists, led by biologist James Thomson, that they had isolated and cultivated human embryonic stem cells. Stem cells are unprogrammed \"master\" cells, which can differentiate into other types of body cells, as needed, thus offering a revolutionary way to replace or repair diseased and damaged body tissues either from injury or disease. These cells are holding out hope for people suffering from Parkinson's disease or diabetes, as mentioned earlier, for example, or those crippled by spinal cord injuries. Stem cells can be taken from adults and discarded umbilical cords, but those from embryos are considered powerful and malleable because they have the potential to become any sort of cell or tissue. The contentious issue here is that the extraction of stem cells from human embryos violates the human rights of the embryos. The extraction of embryonic stem cellsis taken from blastocysts, which are the union of sperm and egg less than two weeks old, which, if transferred to a woman's uterus, might be able to grow into human beings.</p><p></p><p> This Bill aims specifically at prohibiting human reproductive cloning or cloning to create human being. Sir, to clone a human being is to move from procreation to manufacture of human life. I support banning human cloning because I believe that human beings are special and truly sacred, and it is prudent to preserve the<p align=left>Column: 428<p> sanctity of human life. Scientifically, not only do most attempts to clone mammals fail (only about one or two viable offspring for every 100 experiments), about 30% of clones born alive were affected with \"large offspring syndrome\" and other debilitating conditions. Several cloned animals have died prematurely from infections and other complications. The same problems would be expected in human cloning. In addition, scientists do not know how cloning could impact mental development. While factors, such as intellect and mood, may not be as important for a sheep or a cow, they are crucial for the development of healthy humans. The attempt to clone humans is therefore potentially dangerous and ethically irresponsible.</p><p></p><p> Reproductive cloning is to create a baby that is identical to the parent whereas therapeutic cloning is to create tissue or cells that are genetically identical to those of a patient; so when they are implanted into a patient, they will not be rejected.</p><p></p><p> This Bill allows human embryos to be cloned for research under special circumstances, placing Singapore in the camp of a minority that supports limited cloning, including Britain, Japan and China. Sir, therapeutic cloning is a thin wedge to reproductive cloning and I therefore urge the Minister to take the approach of strict scrutiny on the approval on embryonic stem cell research. A balanced approachis required but I favour more to err on the side of caution here to deter any misapplication of Singapore's open-minded stance on research. Singapore is considered one of the world's most research-friendly countries for biomedical work, particularly with regard to stem cells. Rather than depending on embryonic stem cells, many scientists believe stem cells taken from adults could be used. More research should be channelled into this alternative <p align=left>Column: 429<p>source instead of encouraging the easier route in order not to inadvertently retard scientists' innovation on searching for non-controversial sources to get stem cells from diverse sources.</p><p></p><p> I feel that there should be a need for a balanced approach on therapeutic cloning. Singapore is putting in place the funding, facilities and international links that offer one of the best environments in the world to do research, such as the $500 million Biopolis that features top-notch scientific equipment, resources and specialised research facilities and services. Many eminent scientists are drawn by Singapore's reputation as one of the most open-minded, research-friendly countries for biomedical work, and Singapore's determination to become a science hub. Singapore's biomedical science research has matured and is now ready to try to translate some of their locally acquired basic knowledge on cells into real cures and diagnostic tools. Therefore, there is a need for focused leadership to spearhead the potential of Singapore's biomedical science research to offer humankind the new frontier of cure for previously untreatable diseases. Sir, while we should pursue the promise of genetic cures for diseases, we should also act now to direct it towards morally acceptable ends.</p><p></p><p> Sir, I welcome this Bill's aim of licensing of institutes doing embryonic stem cell research. May I ask the Minister whether there are already ethical and legal framework in place for embryonic stem cell research? May I also ask the Minister whether there is also a safeguard body in place that monitors subsequently and regularly on the progress of such research to ensure and prevent scientists deviating into unauthorised research? I also welcome the harsh penalties of this Bill to ensure that research-friendly Singapore is not being taken advantage of by rogue scientists.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 430<p><p> Sir, in our present time when terrorists loom, we cannot be too complacent on any security issues. This Bill does not address bioterrorism. Sir, our scientists have cloned genes to target and destroy cancerous cells.In the same token, such research can also be manipulated to make bioweapons to kill healthy human cells. Such designer bioagents could be worse than any known disease. May I ask the Minister whether any precaution is taken in sensitive research areas? In Britain and the United States, some foreign nationals are either not permitted or vetted before they are allowed to do research in sensitive areas. What are the steps taken in Singapore to address bioterrorism and national security?</p><p></p><p> Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill's primary objective is to ban human cloning.

Rather, it will harmonise Singapore's position on human cloning with that of more advancedcountries, likeUK, Australia, Canada, France, Japan and Israel, which have already passed legislation banning human reproductive cloning.</p><p></p><p> Sir, I would like to comment onfour issues arising from this Bill.

It is an affront to human dignity as cloning could objectify children by treating them as objects of manipulation.<p></p><p> Further, cloned humans could be treated as unequal human beings - a <p align=left>Column: 431<p>modern day Frankenstein - leading to the sinister and repugnant possibility that clones might be sacrificed for the benefit of their creators, perhaps as \"spare parts\" humans to provide organs for transplant.</p><p></p><p> Such eerie scenarios, which were previously thought to belong only to the genre of horror science fiction, are now looking increasingly possible. Only yesterday, it was reported in <I>Streats</I> that a maverick US scientist has implanted DNA taken from two corpses into cow eggs and created living embryos - an act which would certainly be considered by many to be unethical and repulsive. I, therefore, fully support the ban on human cloning on moral, ethical and religious grounds.</p><p></p><p> Indeed, I feel that the Bill has come none too soon given that the Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) was set up more than three years ago in 2000 to examine the social, legal and ethical implications for the biomedical research industry in Singapore. Moreover, the Government has been promoting the development of a biomedical sciences hub in Singapore for some years now and stem cell research, which opens up the potential for creating human clones, remains a hot area of research and, as a key, to winning the battle for bioscience's billions. It is thus imperative that the Government sends a strong signal so as to strongly deter any rogue scientist or researcher from cloning a human. I am particularly pleased that this Bill makes no exception for the Government, so that even it may not clone humans for any reason.</p><p></p><p><I>Prohibitive penalty for violation</I></p><p></p><p> Currently, the risks associated with human cloning are believed to be so great that virtually everyone agrees that these risks, in themselves, would justify a ban <p align=left>Column: 432<p>on such experimentation. Considering the high risks of deaths and severe birth defects, not to mention the ethical and moral issues, the maximum penalty for violation of the Act of $100,000 and/or a jail term of up to 10 years does not appear prohibitive at all. In fact, this may be inadequate and should be increased further. For instance, in Australia, the maximum jail term for a similar offence is 15 years.</p><p></p><p><I>Therapeutic cloning allowed</I></p><p></p><p> Whilst the Bill bans reproductive cloning, therapeutic cloning is excluded from the ban since the Bill allows human embryos to be developed outside the womb for up to 14 days.</p><p></p><p> Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to turn into every kind of replacement tissue a body could need. Stem cell research has thus raised hopes for new treatments and cures for debilitating diseases.</p><p></p><p> Just last Saturday, it was reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> that some researchers from the University of Kiel in Germany used a growth chemical and a patient's bone marrow containing stem cells to \"grow\" a replacement jaw bone in a muscle in his right shoulder. This was subsequently grafted into a gap left by cancer surgery to form the patient's new jaw so that he can chew and eat steak again.</p><p></p><p> Notwithstanding the enormous potential benefits from stem cell research, it remains a hotly debated field of study. The use of stem cells in research is hugely controversial for those who believe that human life begins at conception. On the other hand, proponents of stem cell research, such as Nancy Reagan argues that, \"The theology of the few should not be allowed to forestall the health and well-being of the many\".</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 433<p><p> Arguably, stem cell research is by and large still in its infancy. Virtually all experts agree that it would be a very costly and long hard slog to find cures using stem cells, with success by no means guaranteed.</p><p></p><p> Many companies pursuing cloning and cell replacement therapies have also gone out of business. In fact, I understand that the company that produced Dolly is also in the process of being dismantled. Some scientists also say it would be more practical to use stem cells from adults.</p><p></p><p> I would, therefore, like to ask the Minister at which stage are we in the area of stem cell research and how this compares with countries like the UK, Korea and Japan. What are our main sources of stem cells for scientific use? What is our success with harvesting stem cells from umbilical cords and adults?</p><p></p><p> The Bill has left the door ajar for therapeutic cloning by not banning it. Could scientist abuse the 14-day cut-off point specified in the Bill by feigning ignorance of the age of the embryos? This leads me to my final point which is on the strict monitoring and enforcement required.</p><p></p><p> Whilst US Presidential candidate, John Kerry, has noted that science should not be sacrificed for ideology, there should be strict monitoring of research projects which are open to abuse and unethical practices. We should prevent another Prof Shorvon-type case from occurring. In the Shorvon case, subsequent investigations by a Health Ministry panel found flaws in the system for monitoring the ethics of medical research. Similarly, I would like to ask the Minister if adequate safeguards have been put in place to monitor stem cell research and ensure that moral and ethical lines are not crossed.</p><p></p><p> Has a system of strict regulation and enforcement been set up? If so, what are<p align=left>Column: 434<p> they? Who monitors such research to ensure there is no breach?The Minister should consider publishing some of these as practice rules and regulations to be issued under clause 22 of the Bill.</p><p></p><p> Undoubtedly, stem cell research is a powerful new science that can bring enormous hope. But, in the wrong hands, it is a recipe for horror. We should not close the door on therapeutic cloning which remains controversial but, potentially beneficial. However, at the same time, we must, besides banning human cloning, which is repulsive, take steps to ensure that allowing therapeutic cloning does not open the door for abuse by maverick scientists and researchers, and in the process devalue human life.</p><p></p><p> With these caveats, Sir, I support the Bill.</p><p></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill, and will keep my delivery short.<p></p><p> Ever since the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep, there has been a general sense of unease towards this scientific development.

Then, religious and civic groups, and governments all over the world quickly got to work, to ban, with varying degrees, further research on human embryos. There are so many ethical, religious, medical and legal issues surrounding cloning. I welcome today's opportunity to share some of my personal views.</p><p></p><p> The Bill will ban human or reproductive cloning while permitting research into therapeutic cloning. I think most people will not dispute the ban on human reproductive cloning. It is ethically and morally unacceptable to the general public. However, therapeutic cloning is much, much more controversial. It<p align=left>Column: 435<p> involves altering genes in embryos to create a new genetic makeup. Here, the Bill stipulates that the human embryos used must not be more than 14 days old. The debate is whether it is ethical to create life in order to destroy it later in the course of research.</p><p></p><p> More than 50 countries, including the United States, have banned therapeutic cloning. However, some countries have changed their stance recently. In August, UK issued its first licence allowing scientists to use cloning techniques to create stem cells. In July, Japan has announced its intention to introduce similar legislation.The main reason for permitting therapeutic cloning is the promise it holds for medical cures. Therapeutic cloning offers hope to victims of heart diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, spinal cord injury and many, many other debilitating diseases. There is growing support for therapeutic cloning and I understand that no fewer than 40 Nobel laureates have warned that legislation to ban therapeutic cloning \"would foreclose the legitimate use of nuclear transplantation and impede the progress against some of the most debilitating diseases known everto man\".</p><p></p><p> Nonetheless, the lives of human embryos are at stake here. They are used and destroyed in the interest of science for the benefit of third parties. It is so difficult to agree on when human life truly begins. Does it begin at conception, at 14 days or at birth?</p><p></p><p> Some scientists and religious leaders do not consider very early embryos to be fully human as the cells have not formed a single, individualised entity. Hence, in their opinion, medical research utilising embryos is morally acceptable.My scientific mind agrees with this as well. But when we look at our own children,<p align=left>Column: 436<p> we know that, without a doubt, that their lives begin at conception.</p><p></p><p> To reconcile all these conflicting theories, I have settled on this: early human embryos are intermediate beings. They are not fully human yet, but neither are they simply groups of cells that can be treated like any other tissue samples. They must be treated withdue respect and consideration they deserve.</p><p></p><p> Let us look at comparative legislatures around the world regarding embryo status. In July, the European Court of Human Right ruled, and I quote from the July 9th issue of the <I>Straits Times</I> that, \"... the issue of when the right to life begins was a question to be decided at the national level ... there was no consensus on the nature and ... status of the embryo and/orfoetus\".</p><p></p><p> Thus, we must set our very own guidelines. We must ensure that they are humane and, at the same time, as unambiguous as possible. The 14-day limit is reasonable because after this period, the cells start to differentiate into tissue and organ cells. Therefore, I do not object to permitting research on embryos less than 14 days old.</p><p></p><p> Research on embryos is meant to benefit mankind and relieve suffering. Abhorrent acts such as cloning fetuses to extract organs or tissues, developing human embryos in non-human hosts and using non-human eggs to produce human embryos must be outlawed. Such attempts must be severely punished. I also support the ban on the export and import of any prohibited embryos and definitely the commercial trading of human eggs, sperm and embryos.</p><p></p><p> The Bill has addressed all these concerns and has stated the appropriate penalties. I agree with the proposed jail term of a maximum of 10 years for rogue scientists and their accomplices.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 437<p><p> In my opinion, the Bill is balanced and forward-looking. It will benefit our patients, the medical and research communities and help keep Singapore at the cutting edge of scientific exploration.</p><p></p><p> With that, I conclude my support for the Bill.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> I propose to stop here.

On the same flight was our Olympic team returning home. The flight landed at an unearthly hour, at 5.15 in the morning, and yet at the Changi Airport to welcome them were RAdm Teo Chee Hean, President of the Singapore National Olympic Council and Minister for Defence,Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and<p align=left>Column: 438<p> Sports, andmore than 200 ardent supporters and fans. When Jiawei and team came through the gate, the crowd cheered and swarmed around them. I thought probably Jiawei needed the security officer more than the two Ministers present. Cameras and flashes went crazy at the reception for the welcome. It was amazing and wonderful.Our team has come home and Singapore is with them.<p></p><p> For 16 days, 10,500 of the world's best athletes from 202 countries and territories competed in 28 sports and 300 events in Athens. At the closing ceremony, IOC President, Dr Jacques Rogge,called the Athens Games the \"Unforgettable Dream,Dream Games\". Our own dream, Singapore's dream for an Olympic medal, almost came true in Athens. Our Olympic team has done its best for Singapore and stood its own against the world's best. We watched and cheered Ronald Susilo's gallant efforts in defeating Lin Dan, the world's No. 1 in two straight sets. We were pleasantly surprised when Zhang Xueling fought fearlessly into the top eight and lostto North Korean Kim Hyang Mi by two sets to four, while a day ago Kim Hyang Mi had defeated the world's No. 3, Niu Jiangfong, in four straight sets. Our hopes were raised when Li Jiawei defeated Wan Nan, the world's No. 2, and went into the semi-finals. The headlines in the <I>Straits Times</I> screamed: \"Gather around for the live telecast. Table tennis fever at 5.00 pm for Singaporeans at home, bars and abroad\". We shared Jiawei's deep disappointment when she lost the semi-final match and the match for the bronze. But we knew that she has fought hard,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>done well for herself and for Singapore. Our Singaporean journalists and I were with Jiawei. She was inconsolable,feeling that she has failed to live up to the hope of fellow Singaporeans. Then, the Prime Minister (PM) called. PM comforted and encouraged her. PM said, and I quote, <p align=left>Column: 439<p>\"There is no reason to be sad. We are proud of you. Yes, you have not won the top prize but we will keep on trying. Sports isn't just medals. It is doing our best. Try again-overcome setbacks, depending on each other, being part of Team Singapore. Our athletes, many of them have made Singapore their home and they have become part of our family and we should welcome them and celebratethem.\"<p></p><p> Jiawei told me, \"<I>zong li jiao wo bu yao ku, wo bu ku le</I>\", or PM asked me not to cry and I stopped. And then, she smiled. Thank you, PM, for speaking to Jiawei and for your words of encouragement, not just to her, but to our athletes and to Singaporeans. Our athletes will overcome all adversities and try and try again. I hope that when PM phones Jiawei or any one of our athletes at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008, it will be to congratulate her or him for winning a medal for Singapore.</p><p></p><p> Indeed, our athletes have done us proud through their relentless efforts, their fighting spirit and their conduct. MediaCorp, through its partnership with IOC, provided 630 hours of coverage through six TV channels that enabled tens of thousands of Singaporeans a unique experience watching our athletes compete live. The daily prominent coverage by all the newspapers under the SPH Group provided exciting first-hand coverage of our athletes'exploits forour Singaporean readers. The team of reporters andcameramen in Athens was very much of Team Singapore, sharing the ups and downs of our team. Our media has indeed played an important role in supporting sports excellence. They have helped to project the image of our athletes and fire up the imagination and support of Singaporeans. Our athletes truly appreciate the positive and encouraging <p align=left>Column: 440<p>reports appearing in our newspapers and television programmes.</p><p></p><p> For those of us who have been concerned with the development of a sports culture in Singapore, we feel very happy with the development,the care, involvement and concern of Singaporeans. According to MediaCorp, 313,000 watched Jiawei in the semi-finals and 456,000 in the bronze medal play-off. All in all, there were 2.6 million viewers over the whole games period. The many encouraging comments and letters, SMS and emails, praising the efforts, encouraging all our athletes and urging them on despite losing, were just heartwarming. I know that sports excellence has the support of Singaporeans and that we are developing a strong sports culture.</p><p></p><p> Today, we read about Jiawei accepting Ronald's proposal. We are all happy for them and wish them happiness together ever after - but do not forget the Olympic medal.I hope our table tennis and badminton associations will adopt family-friendly policies so that we have young Jiaweis and Ronalds fighting for the glory of Singapore in 20 years' time.</p><p></p><p> We have a relatively short history in promoting sports excellence. SPEX 2000 was only launched in 1993 with $8 million support, half from the Government and half from Singapore Pools. Despite this, our athletes, with thatsupport, won eight golds at the three Asian Games from 1994 to the year 2002, four golds at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Additional support came in 2000 when Government provided $500 million of extra support over five years.Out of this, $150 million went to enhance the SPEX programme and is much needed by our NSAs. This additional funding will come to an end byfinancial year 2005 and new money has to be found. MCYS and SSC have done a good job in laying a solid foundation for <p align=left>Column: 441<p>sports excellence and we hope that they will continue to do so.</p><p></p><p> Since the Olympic Games in 2000, wewent to the Olympics not any more as mere participants, but with serious intention of winning a medal for Singapore. Junhong had a chance to do so in Sydney, Jiawei had a possibility even for a silver or gold in Athens and Ronald and Xueling were in the quarter-finals and just one step away from fighting for a medal. I fully agree with Tay Cheng Khoon when he said \"Singapore must build on the momentum created by the relative achievements of Ronald, Xueling and Jiawei and there must be more serious credible medal challengers\"in an article in the <I>Straits Times</I> on 30th August. I too believe that an Olympic medal is within reach of Singapore at the 2008 or 2012 Olympic Games.</p><p></p><p> Government funding and support are indispensable for sports excellence in Singapore. I would urge MCYS to start looking into the continuous funding and support of sports excellence after FY2005. In fact, I would argue that while the current SPEX programme has and will continue to support our athletes and NSAs' efforts to excel at the SEA Games, we should now look at two additional tiers of funding. One tier is to support sports like bowling, sailing, shooting and body-building that have provensuccess at Asian Games and the next highest tier to support sports like table tennis and badminton that will bring us medals at the Olympic Games. I also urge MCYS to implement multi-year funding to NSAsfor at least the two top tiers, a proposal that has been brought to this House during the Budget debate. To do well at the Olympics or the Asian Games, one has to plan and act at least eight years ahead. No one can do much without commitment and funding. These NSAs and our top athletes need special support.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 442<p><p> Sports excellence needs the support of our corporations as well. Korean companies are well-known for their support for sports. Almost every big<I>chaebo</I>adopts a sport for support. It is not just about funding and sponsorship but also the expertise in areas such as management, financial controls, strategic planning that are useful and which companies can provide to NSAs.</p><p></p><p> On the other hand, companies can also benefit from associations of sports and athletes and we can see ample examples of this good relation, for example, between the IOC and companies such as Samsung and Coca-Cola in the top programme. I believe that more companies can be persuaded to come forward - by this, I mean Singaporean companies -to support sports and MCYS can work with them. If I may also be bold enough to suggest that TLCs will have a special role to play and can lead and lend a lot of support in our quest for sports excellence.</p><p></p><p> In addition to funding, NSAs and athletes would also need support in terms of sports sciences,coaching, sparring partners, technical expertise, overseas training and competitions. I would ask MCYS to look into pooling and consolidatingthe sports sciencesupport of theSSC Sports School and that of the School of Physical Education under NIE to provide better supportto NSAs and athletes.</p><p></p><p> Recently, I learnt about the Direct School Admission scheme offered by Raffles School, NUS School and a number of selected schools. This scheme would allow admission of P6 students with special talents in sports, visual arts, music and other areas into these secondary schools, independent of their PSLE \"T\" score. In time to come, I believe that we have many schools that will become a nursery for our future sports champions in addition to our Sports School. Perhaps,<p align=left>Column: 443<p> MCYS should also provide adequate support to these other schools in order to broaden our base of sports talents.</p><p></p><p> In the review of performance of countries taking part in various games, it is discovered that athletes of host countries usually do better when they are at home. For example, Thailand won three golds at the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994 and 24 golds at the 1998 SEA Games when it was held in Bangkok. South Korea won 65 golds at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok and 96 golds when the Games went to Busan in 2002. Vietnam won 33 golds at the 2001 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur and 158 golds when the Games was held in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in 2003. Singapore won 50 gold medals when we hosted the 1993 SEA Games, our best ever performance. Some of the reasons were: home teams would always be better prepared and fight harder for the country's honour in front of their home crowd. Home crowd support and home advantage also play a part. I believe that hosting major games such as the Asian Games would definitely boost the standards of our athletes and bring our sports excellence to the next higher level. I would ask MCYS to consider the possibility of hosting the Asian Games in Singapore in the not too far away future and bear this possibility in mind when designing the Sports Hub.</p><p></p><p> The pursuit of sports excellence cannot be done by our NSAs or athletes alone. It requires the support of our Government and all Singaporeans. Let us all be inspired by what is possible and put Singapore in the forefront of sports in the world in tandem with our outstanding economic development that we have achieved.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (Dr Vivian Balakrishnan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker,time is<p align=left>Column: 444<p> moving on, soI will keep my reply very short. I join Mr Ng Ser Miang in paying tribute to our Olympic team, especially toMiss Li Jiawei, Ronald Susilo and Zhang Xueling who did extremely well, kept the Singapore flag flying, raised our hopes and indeed united us.<p></p><p> There are two key aspects that need to be highlighted. First is that they have broken a psychological barrier. For a long while, we have said that we cannot do it - we are just there as spectators, we are there just forexperience, we can never win. I think they have shown Singaporeans that we do have a chance and breaking that psychological barrier is perhaps the most important contribution that their performance has set out for us.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> The second aspect is that for those few days they brought together an entire nation to share in their celebrations, and also to share in their disappointments. And one key lesson which we also learned from that is that it almost does not matter which sport it is. Table tennis has usually been considered to be a sport which the Chinese have predominantly been interested in. But as Li Jiawei herself told our journalists, that when she looked up to the stand, there was cheering for her. She saw Singaporeans - Indians, Malays and Chinese - collectively celebrating and cheering her on. So, we have shown that sports indeed does have the power to rally and to unify us.<p></p><p> The secondpoint I want to move on to is the pursuit of sports excellence. This does not come easily and multiple ingredients are needed. We need money, a sporting culture and training systems. Let me touch first on money.</p><p></p><p> You all know that we have a $500 million Sporting Singapore fund which has been used since 2001 and Mr Ng is very anxious that it would run out by the end of 2005. Let me reassure him that MCYS is currently preparing to negotiate with <p align=left>Column: 445<p>the Ministry of Finance and Singapore Pools to replenish that source of funds so that we could continue with our pursuit of sports excellence. The point, however, is that it is not just a matter of blindly throwing money at an objective or at a problem. But we do need to critically and carefully scrutinise the strategic plans of the national sports associations and the athletes themselves who would indeed be the cutting edge in our pursuit of sports excellence. We need, therefore, to focus. We do not have an unlimited source of funds in Singapore. We need to focus on areas and in sports where we do seriously have already done well or have a good chance of doing well in the future.</p><p></p><p> I have also heard the feedback from some of the sports associations that even the current limit of $3 million for core sports may be insufficient. We would look at all these issues and we would come out, in due time, with a practical and sensible way of allocating resources in a focused manner so that it makes a difference and, hopefully, we would have a significantly better chance of winning medals in the future.</p><p></p><p> The second aspect I want to touch on is culture. Again, as the Memberhas alluded to,the fact that so many Singaporeans were watching TV, reading newspapers and supporting our athletes, it creates an atmosphere, an environment, a culture in which people are interested in sports. Hopefully, this would translate into people actively participating in sports because ultimately it is not a nation of couch potatoes that we want but a nation that lives, thinks and dreams sports because of the multiple benefits that it brings us as individuals and as a nation. If we have a truly sporting culture in our country,we would have the capability to produce potential champions,we would support champions, then corporate entities would feel that it is worth their while to provide sponsorships and to truly <p align=left>Column: 446<p>support and enhance the multiple programmes which our athletes need in order to compete at the highest level.</p><p></p><p> The third aspect is training. Training requires systems, facilities and schools. Members know that we arehoping to roll out the tender for the rebuilding of a sports hub. This, hopefully, would take place by the third quarter of nextyear, but there are many, many details that need to be sorted out because this is not a trivial project. Membersknow that we have got the Sports School. It is a start. We need to continue to support this, to allow more of our students who choose sports, either as a career in itself, or as a serious pursuit co-existing with their studies so that this again would be another source of potential champions with us. We also know that it is not just the Sports School that is involved with this, but many mainstream schools. Besides that, it is in their own interest to have both a sports-for-all programme as well as a sports excellence programme. And we would certainly work with the Ministry of Education to promote this.</p><p></p><p> The national sports associations have to make sure that they are well-run, that they have good accountability for their funds, that there is good leadership. Ultimately, they require leaderswho are passionate about sports, who are nurturingthe young men and women who would beunder their charge for many years at a time.</p><p></p><p>  I would like to end by saying that we are a small nation and we have often lowered our aims or hopes because we say we are small and we could not produce the talent. I think we are at the stage in our lives as a nation when the sports arena has shown us that being small is compatible with having big dreams and high hopes if we have people, if we have the willingness to commit resources to it, if we are well-organised <p align=left>Column: 447<p>and if, as a nation, we are united in this pursuit of sports excellence. And, in fact, it is these same ingredients which we need for success, not just in sports, but for success as a nation in the future.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 448<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ADJOURNMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P> Resolved,<p align=\"left\"></p><p align=\"left\"> \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\"</p><p align=\"left\"></p><p align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</p><p align=\"right\">Six minutes past Seven o'clock pm.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>  <p align=left>Column: 449<p> \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MEDISHIELD AND ELDERSHIELD SCHEMES--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>MEDISHIELD AND ELDERSHIELD SCHEMES</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Gan Kim Yong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Gan Kim Yong </B>asked the Minister for Health whether in reviewing the MediShield scheme, he will also consider reviewing the ElderShield scheme so as to enhance its effectiveness.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Khaw Boon Wan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ElderShield scheme was introduced onlytwo years ago.

I sympathise with her and her family.<p></p><p> As Dr Ong noted, she mentioned that she had already spent about $50,000 on her child's medical bills since birth. Dr Ong asked why the medical safety net was not there to help ease her financial difficulties.</p><p>My Ministry has looked into this case. The child was born in a private hospital in 1998. After several months in a neonatal ward there, the child was transferred to the National University Hospital. She has been under the care of the NUH ever since.</p><p></p><p> We have asked her mother about her medical expenses. She explained that the $50,000 expenses comprised: (a) $22,000 largely incurred in the private hospital and an initial stay at the NUH; and (b) $30,000 incurred in the NUH since 1999.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 451<p><p> The family sought the assistance of the NUH's Medical Social Worker (MSW) in late 1998 after they realised that they would have problem coping with the child's continuing medical care. After an investigation, the MSW was able to secure the approval of the Hospital Medifund Committee to help this family. This was in early 1999.</p><p></p><p> To date, Medifund has paid $21,000 of the bills incurred by the patient, and has continued to help the family for the patient's medical treatment.</p><p></p><p> The family's payment of the child's medical bills so far is therefore about $31,000 and not $50,000. The bulk of the expenses were incurred in the private hospital to which the family had owed some money. The mother has however clarified that, since the screening of the Charity Show, the private hospital has decided to waive the rest of the bill.</p><p></p><p> As Members can see, the medical safety net is well in place for those needy Singaporeans who, despite heavy Government subsidies, Medisave and MediShield, are still unable to afford their medical bill.<br></p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:BUDGET FOR MCYS--><p align=left>Column: 451<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>BUDGET FOR MCYS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Dr Chong Weng Chiew--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Dr Chong Weng Chiew </B>asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance whether there will be a corresponding increase in the budget for the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, with its enlarged portfolio.<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has made reaching out to youth one of its priorities.

Roots to strengthen their ties to Singapore, to motivate them to contribute in whatever way they can, and to make a difference to this nation. So with wings they can fly all over the world, yet remain connected to Singapore and call it home.<p></p><p> To achieve this vision, we need to engage our youth and empower them to be active citizens. My Ministry has just launched a six-week consultation programme, \"Youth: <p align=left>Column: 453<p>Creating Our Future\".

On top of this, we are conducting focus group discussions and forums with different segments of the post-independence generation to gather diverse perspectives and ideas. The experience thus far has been very encouraging with youth displaying their desire to be part of this exciting process. These perspectives and ideas would help my Ministry to formulate appropriate action plans and initiatives to get youth informed, engaged, excited and involved. This will add on to our existing initiatives that were announced during the Committee of Supply for my Ministry earlier this year.</p><p></p><p> It is premature to discuss resources as we are currently still in the process of consultation and gathering views.

While the proportion of Arts stream students in the FASS intake has hovered around the same level over the past three years, the proportion of Science stream students has increased.<p></p><p> This increase is largely accounted for by the phasing out of the Commerce stream in Junior College since 2001, which has produced a larger gain in the number of Science stream students, compared to Arts stream students, in Junior Colleges and Centralised Institutes.

For large and complex organisations, it would be extremely difficult to uncover fraud without some help from within the company. Enron and WorldCom are just two examples where so-called corporate whistle-blowers have been instrumental in surfacing corporate fraud. Indeed, the UK through its Public Interests Disclosure Act and the US through the Sarbanes Oxley Act have, amongst other things, tried to provide some form of protection for whistle-blowers.<p></p><p> It is too early to say whether such legislation has had the desired benefits or whether it has led to some unintended consequences. For instance, there could be a proliferation of unfounded allegations of fraud from employees who may simply have an axe to grind but who now have the protection of the law. This would not only undermine our companies but also cause disruption to operations. Second, it is not clear that we need specific legislation to protect whistle-blowers given the many other reforms, especially in the area of internal controls, which we have put in place in recent years to enhance corporate stewardship. For instance, auditors are required under the Companies Act to report to the Minister for Finance should they come across, in the course of their duties, a possible fraud or act of dishonesty by officers or employees against a public company. The authorities, such as the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commercial Affairs Department have also been able to rely on anonymous complaints and tip offs to surface possible fraud cases.</p><p><br> Even so, it is important that we continually review our practices in the light of developments here and experience elsewhere. The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) has been studying the whistle-blowing legislation in other countries, to see if they have had the desired effects, check if there have been unintended <p align=left>Column: 459<p>consequences, and assess if Singapore should adopt a similar law to protect whistle-blowers.<br></p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MR ISKANDAR JALIL--><p align=left>Column: 459<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>MR ISKANDAR JALIL</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;44.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Ms Braema Mathiaparanam--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam </B>asked the Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (a) what help was given to Mr Iskandar Jalil to save his 43-year-old kiln; (b) what alternatives were offered to him in terms of working with that kiln; and (c) what support is given to artists who prefer to work from their homes and are in need of such spaces and facilities.<br></P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Lee Boon Yang--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Iskandar Jalil had been creating his pottery works with a large gas-fired kiln and a smaller kiln at his single storey detached home-cum-workshop. In January this year, URA received a public complaint that Mr Iskandar's home was used as a pottery workshop. URA noted that the shed built by the Master Potter to store his pots and kilns were built up to the common boundary wall. Then in March, SCDF received a public complaint that a number of large gas cylinders were stored at Mr Iskandar's workshop. Upon inspection, SCDF found that the gas cylinders in Mr Iskandar's compound were a fire hazard to his neighbours. Mr Iskandar was therefore asked to set his shed back by a metre. He was also asked to remove the large gas cylinders as they were illegal for private use in a private dwelling, but was allowed to keeptwo small gas cylinders.<p></p><p> Upon learning about his predicament on 4th May 2004, Senior Parliamentary Secretary Mr Yatiman Yusof, together with CEO of NAC and senior officials, met with Mr Iskandar at the workshop. At this point, Mr Iskandar had started demolishing the structure including the roof cover of his kiln. Without the large gas cylinders, Mr Iskandar was unable to operate the larger kiln. This kiln was too large and fragile to be relocated, and hence Mr Iskandar decided to dismantle it. And while Mr Iskandar was able to store small gas cylinders and continue operating the smaller kiln, he would have difficulty achieving the desired effects.</p><p></p><p> To help Mr Iskandar continue his work, NAC brought Mr Iskandar to view the kiln at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) Middle Road Campus under the Arts Housing Scheme. Mr Iskandar was also invited by STB to use the Guan Huat Dragon Kiln at Jalan Bahar. We understand that Mr Iskandar is still considering the two venues.</p><p></p><p> We hope that he would continue to create his unique and renowned works from the new premises. MICA and NAC will continue to support Mr Iskandar. I would also like to highlight that generally, all artists are free to operate from home. However where the use of specialised equipment and alteration or additions to the home environment are required, artists should seek the advice of the proper authorities.</p><p></p><p> MICA recognises the need for artists to have conducive spaces to practise their art. That is why we operate the NAC Arts Housing Scheme to provide suitable and affordable housing for deserving arts groups and artists to engage in their creative work.</p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS--><p align=left>Column: 461<p><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:NATIONAL DAY RALLY--><p align=left>Column: 461<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>NATIONAL DAY RALLY</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how is the National Day Rally on 22nd August 2004 funded; (b) is it a political party rally or a national rally; and (c) if it is a National Day rally, why are opposition Members of Parliament excluded from this Rally every year.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Lee Hsien Loong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Day Rally on 22nd August 2004 was funded by the Government.<p></p><p> At the Rally, the Prime Minister explained the Government's policy directions and priorities and the challenges facing the nation.

DC will be registering four more hydrogen fuel cell cars under the TIDES.<p></p><p> To ensure the vehicles are safe, LTA imposes special registration requirements for such cars.

These features include a hydrogen leakage detection system to continually monitor for gas leakage (even when the car is parked). If leakage is detected, the hydrogen supply from the tank would be automatically cut off to minimise any fire or explosion risk.</p><p></p><p> As additional safety measures, DC has also designed the cars such that the hydrogen storage tanks are mounted in the middle of the car and protected by a steel cage to reduce the impact in the event of a collision. An inertia switch would also cut off the hydrogen and power supply during a collision to minimise the danger posed to the occupants or other road users.

This will shorten their travelling time significantly. For example, with the CCL, a commuter will be able to make a direct trip from Bishan to Buona Vista in just 19 minutes, compared to 34 minutes today on the NS-EW line. In addition, congestion at interchange stations within the city (such as City Hall and Raffles Place) will be reduced. Such orbital lines are common in major cities to relieve congestion in city centres as they grow.</p><p></p><p> The CCL will also significantly improve the coverage and connectivity of the RTS network and enhance accessibility to sub-regional centres such as Paya Lebar, Serangoon, Bishan and Buona Vista, and the new development at Harbourfront.</p><p></p><p> The CCL is expected to have sufficient commuters to sustain its operation.

In approving fare increases, it has to balance commuters' interest and the long-term viability of the public transport operators. All fare proposals are scrutinised stringently to ensure that fare increases are soundly justified on the basis of unavoidable cost increases and investment in service improvements.<p></p><p> In the 2002 fare review, the PTC was satisfied that operating costs of SMRT trains and buses (then TIBS) had increased significantly in the previoustwo years due to inflation and investments in service improvement. It was on this basis that SMRT was granted a fare increase of 2.5% for trains and 2.2% for buses (then TIBS). The increase was within the annual fare cap of 2.5% derived from the CPI+X formula, and much lower than the 6.9% actual increase in cost incurred by the operators.</p><p></p><p> SMRT has explained its first quarter profits as part of its quarterly release of financial results and in response to letters in the forum page. As highlighted by SMRT, its profits in thefirst quarter of 2003 were badly depressed because of the SARS outbreak. In addition, it had benefited from various cost cutting measures such as the delayed replacement of non-safety related assets and reduction in staff and related costs like the CPF cuts. In fact, because SMRT was able to undertake stringent measures to contain operating costs last year and achieve a profit, there was no need for a fare increase this year.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CAR OWNERSHIP--><p align=left>Column: 465<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CAR OWNERSHIP</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Minister for Transport (a) how car ownership papers can be transferred without proof of original documents like the logcard and identity card; (b) how will the Land Transport Authority (LTA) know that the additional authorisation letter introduced after the Benz E240 scam will be free from fraud too, considering that those conmen can even forge logcards and PARF papers; (c) how much money was involved in the scam of forging fake PARF and COE rebate papers from 1999 to 2003; (d) why was the public not warned earlier about such scams happening in Singapore; (e) how much losses were involved and who bears the damages for these losses; (f) what is the reason for restricting rebate owners from using the maximum paper value for a new car purchase; (g) whether the LTA charges for each transfer/splitting of the PARF paper can be reduced from $10 to $5; (h) how much did LTA collect from the PARF paper transfer fees and transfer of ownership fees for each year since 1998 to date; <p align=left>Column: 467<p>and (i) can the transfer of ownership fees be drastically reduced too since most of the car taxes have already been paid for via import tax, ARF and COE.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Cheow Tong--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will only effect the transfer of a vehicle, upon the payment of transfer fees, provided both the buyer and owner of the vehicle complete an application form and submit the following documents to LTA:<p></p><p> Original vehicle logcard<br> Original NRIC of both the owner and buyer; and<br> Original motor insurance certificate in the name of the buyer.</p><p></p><p> The LTA has removed the need for an authorisation letter from vehicle owners and buyers who are unable to effect the transfer of vehicle ownership personally at LTA. This was only an interim measure. As a new control measure, the person who submits the application for transfer on behalf of the owner and buyer is required to fill in his particulars on the application form and also to submit his original NRIC for verification to perform the transaction. This is in addition to the submission of the documents mentioned earlier.</p><p></p><p> Between 1999 and 2003, there was only a single case involving fake PARF and COE rebate certificates. This occurred in November 2000. The suspect apparently soldnine fake rebate certificates to buyers for a sum amounting to about $536,000. The case was reported to the Police. It was not publicised, as the case was then under Police investigations. However, LTA conducted a review of its internal procedures, and in September 2001, LTA stopped the issue of physical PARF and COE rebate certificates. Consequently, motorists did not have to produce the physical certificates to utilise, transfer or divide their PARF/COE rebates. They are only required to complete the necessary application forms and furnish their identification documents to use, transfer or divide the rebates.</p><p><br> During the same period, there were alsotwo other cases, one involved the use of duplicate logcards that were issued by the LTA and the other involved use of forged logcards, to transfer or de-register vehicles without the knowledge of the finance company or the registered owner. The amount involved in these cases was about $6 million, and the victims were mainly finance/leasing companies. These cases were also reported to the Police and investigations are still on going. LTA had also worked with the Association of Hire Purchase and Finance Companies (AHPFC) to review the processes that were exploited by these fraudsters. For example, a duplicate vehicle logcard requested by a registered owner would be issued only after checking with the AHPFC.</p><p></p><p> A holder of the Preferential Additional Registration Fee (PARF) and Certificate of Entitlement (COE) rebates can use the entire amount to offset the upfront taxes payable to register a new vehicle in his name. In cases where the PARF/COE rebates exceed the upfront taxes payable, the holder can split the rebates into smaller values or transfer the rebate to a third party at a mutually agreed rate. An administrative fee of $10 is payable in each instance, to cover the costs of providing these services.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 469<p><p> A transfer fee is levied when a vehicle is transferred from one owner to another.

In a study on smoking among the Singapore youths (2001), young women aged 19-24 years indicated that they smoke because of peer pressure, to relief stress, control their weight and improve their social image.</p><p></p><p> A report published by the British Medical Association in 2004 on the impact of smoking on reproductive health showed conclusive evidence that female smokers are more likely to be infertile compared to non-smokers. It also reported that female smokers take longer to conceive and couples who smoke are less likely to respond to infertility treatment and the risks of miscarriage and stillbirth are higher in pregnant women who smoke.</p><p></p><p> In view of the rising trend of young female smokers, the Health Promotion Board is now targeting its campaign to educate and encourage young females to stay smoke-free or quit the habit.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

For example, they are 60% more likely to put in unpaid overtime compared to permanent workers.<sup>3</sup></p><p></p><p> Studies on Canadian and American workers<sup>4</sup> show that where workers embark voluntarily on contingent work, especially for those seeking to balance work demands with domestic or other responsibilities, they may increase productivity. However, when workers enter into these arrangements involuntarily, because there are no better employment opportunities available, their job benefits are reduced and they can find themselves marginalised in the workplace, leading to employee frustrations and morale problems. Thus, whilst the number of short-term contract workers in Singapore is still small, we would need to monitor the trend closely.</p><p></p></p></span><p><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><font size=\"2\"><sup>1</sup></font> <font size=\"2\">Source: Conditions of Employment, 2002, <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 10pt\"><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=http://www.mom.gov.sg./\"\"><span style=\"COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none\">www.mom.gov.sg.</span></a></span></font></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><font size=\"2\"><sup>2</sup> Total employment is defined as the sum of workers employed by the private sector establishments with at least 25workers and the number of freelancers/casual workers as well as those supplied by labour suppliers or employment agencies who are deployed in these establishments.</font></p><p><font size=\"2\"><sup>3</sup> Engellandt, Axel and Regina T.

This allows companies to better tie rewards for workers to performance.<p></p><p> The flexible wage system is applicable to the entire workforce including Singaporeans, permanent residents as well as foreign employees. This is because all employees, whether local or foreign, contribute to the performance of the company, and in achieving the key performance indicators. Such a wage system will enable employers to incentivise and reward employees with a higher variable payment when companies perform well. When times are bad and the company's performance is adversely affected, they can adjust wage costs for the company to remain viable and to save jobs.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:FOREIGN WORK PERMIT HOLDERS--><p align=left>Column: 483<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>FOREIGN WORK PERMIT HOLDERS</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Minister for Manpower (a) whether foreign work permit holders/workers are allowed to drive lorries and/or pickups in Singapore even if they have valid driving licences; (b) whether any work permit holders had been caught for driving lorries/pickups on work-related matters in the last four years; and (c) will the Ministry impose stiffer penalties on employers who make use of foreign work permit holders for such purposes.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign workers are only allowed to work as drivers if this is a specific requirement for their approved occupation, eg, they were hired as ambulance or truck drivers.<p></p><p align=left>Column: 485<p><p> Since January 2001, the Ministry has acted against 135 employers who have illegally deployed work permit holders under their employment as drivers.

Development of healthy relationships characterised by open communication based on trust requires much commitment by parents. Building confidence in connecting with their children is a life long process for every parent, starting during the early years of the child.<p></p><p> As teenage years are probably the most challenging for parent and child, more efforts and resources have been invested in developing programmes to address the challenges of parent-teenager relationships.</p><p></p><p> To ensure effective and comprehensive outreach, my Ministry's School Family Education Programme was launchedtwo years ago in collaboration with the Ministry of Education to facilitate easier access to family life education programmes. During its first year of implementation in 2003, 14,000 parents in 18 schools participated in parenting as well as parent-child bonding programmes. About 5,500 of them were parents of students fromseven secondary schools. I am pleased to report that more than 95% of the 14,000 parents have found the School Family Education Programme very useful and 60% of them reported improvements in their family life as a result of using the skills. Currently 40 schools are participating in the Programme. Another 20 schools will be coming on board next year.</p><p></p><p> The main focus of the annual National Family Week campaigns in 2003 and 2004 has been on strengthening parent-teen relationships. Based on favourable feedback and response, the Ministry will continue to emphasise the importance of parent-teenagers relations in next year's National Family Week.</p><p></p><p> The additional aspect is to encourage teenagers to better understand the challenges their parents face in managing their family, work and personal commitments as it takes both the child and parents to make family relations work. Lifeskills training for youths currently offered under School Family Education will be enhanced to meet the aspirations and contributions of youth. Such an emphasis will contribute to the teenager's development into a unique, mature individual with strong family ties.</p><p></p><p> Whilst the Government can help to facilitate programmes to promote and build strong families, ultimately the responsibility to establish strong parent-child bonds must still lie within the family.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CUT-OFF OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY--><p align=left>Column: 487<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>CUT-OFF OF ELECTRICITY SUPPLY</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mdm Halimah Yacob </B>asked the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) whether his Ministry is aware of the plight of the family whose electricity supply has been cut off for not having paid the arrears because the sole breadwinner is unemployed due to kidney problems; (b) whether any assistance has been rendered to the family; and (c) what schemes are there to help those with long term chronic illnesses and are unable to work or can only do limited kinds of work.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Halimah has highlighted the plight of the family where the breadwinner became unemployed due to kidney problems and the electricity supply was cut off due to arrears in payment. The family was affected by a fire in their Eunos Crescent flat on 21st July 2004.<p></p><p> The Community Development Councils (CDCs) help to implement the financial assistance programmes that MCDS has put in place. In the case of the family, South East CDC has extended a grant of $300 per month for three months, from August to October 2004, to help tide the family over the period as both parents are unemployed, and their two older children, aged 23 and 19 years, have only just started working. The CDC also gave the family a $100 NTUC voucher for buying food and other necessities.</p><p></p><p> The family also received assistance from other sources following the incident. The Kampong Ubi Citizen's Consultative Committee (CCC) helped pay in full the family's outstanding arrears in utilities and serviceand conservancy fees, amounting to about $1,500. They also made arrangements with the Kampong Ubi PAP Community Foundation (PCF), to provide school uniform and textbooks for the youngest child, a Secondary 1 student, to ensure that his school classes are not disrupted.</p><p></p><p> An additional $5,400 was raised for the family by the secondary school where the youngest child is schooling, while Singapore Power Services contributed and installed lightings and electrical fittings amounting to $220 for their refurbished flat.</p><p></p><p> The refurbishment of the flat was paid for by HDB Fire Insurance. The family has moved back to their flat, and has expressed gratitude for the assistance which they have received. South East CDC will continue to keep in contact with the family to provide further assistance if necessary.</p><p></p><p> Madam Halimah has asked about assistance for those with long-term chronic illnesses, and who are unable to or can only do limited work. My Ministry presently has two assistance schemes that are able to help such individuals and their families.</p><p><br> Under the Interim Financial Assistance Scheme (IFAS), needy individuals and families receive a monthly allowance and where necessary, grants to help them pay for the utilities and serviceand conservancy charges. For those living in rental flats, they can apply for the Rent and Utilities Assistance Scheme (RUAS) for help in their monthly rental and utilities bills. MOE may also exempt the children from paying school fees. Applications for IFAS or RUAS assistance can be made at the relevant Community Development Council.</p><p></p><p align=left>Column: 489<p><p> In addition to these schemes, families with young children who need child care or pre-school support, can also seek help from the Community Development Councils. Those who need assistance with payment of medical bills can approach the Medical Social Workers at the restructured hospital or polyclinic for assistance.</p><p></p><p> Families in need of financial assistance should approach their Community Development Council early so that appropriate help can be extended in time.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:POLITICAL APATHY--><p align=left>Column: 489<p><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>POLITICAL APATHY</P></span>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (a) how can young Singaporeans be involved in the alternative politics of the country when the powers are fully held in the hands of one political party and when there is no serious alternative choice for the people to consider or get involved in the political process; and (b) what is the Government doing to address this disenfranchised group in our society since this \u20ac\u02dcpolitical apathy' is a serious concern that will affect the future of the country.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are abundant opportunities and channels for young Singaporeans to be involved in the political process. The fact that the Government is formed by just one political party is an outcome of a democratic election. It does not preclude young Singaporeans' participation in the political process. Young Singaporeans are free to participate in politics, form a political party, or join a political party regardless of the party in power. The fact that Mr Steve Chia, himself a young Singaporean, is able to engage in politics and be a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament today is a testimony to this fact.<p></p><p> Mr Chia's assertion that \"there is no serious alternative\" reflects the failure of his own party to attract serious minded people with realistic comprehensive programmes for the future of Singapore.</p><p></p><p> In contrast, our experience with engaging youths has shown that young Singaporeans do have ideals, ideas, passion and are keen to contribute to nation building.</p><p></p><p> The Government is actively looking into how to get young Singaporeans more involved in shaping the future of Singapore. The Remaking Singapore Committee had in 2003 considered avenues for increasing youth awareness of policy issues, and recommended the formation of a National Youth Forum (NYF) under the auspices of the National Youth Council (NYC) to provide a formal platform for youths from a variety of backgrounds to study policy formulation and debate national issues.</p><p></p><p> The inaugural NYF will be held from 19th November to 23rd December 2004. The participating youth will undergo training in research, critical thinking, public speaking skills and public policy. They would have opportunities to meet with senior politicians, business and community leaders, as well as other key decision makers. The participants will have the opportunity to debate their ideas, and present their policy recommendations to the Government. They will also have the opportunity to act on their recommendations in partnership with the relevant authorities and community organisations.</p><p align=left>Column: 491<p><p><br> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has recently called on younger Singaporeans to \"step forward to make a difference to yourselves, to your fellow citizens and to Singapore\". The Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) is taking this call one step forward and on 14th August 2004, has embarked on a six-week public consultation exercise focused on the post-independence generation, called \"Youth: Creating Our Future\".</p><p></p><p> Through this exercise, young Singaporeans are invited to share their dreams and aspirations, and their plans for making their dreams and aspirations a reality. They are encouraged to surface ideas on how they can be active citizens, be it in the political, social or economic realms. The Government will partner the youth of Singapore to translate these ideas into reality and examine how it can facilitate even greater youth engagement and involvement.<br></p></p></span>   <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
