The\r\n\r\npolicy  maintains  the proportion of  each  ethnic  group\r\n\r\nwithin certain neighbourhood and block limits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EIP has improved the ethnic balance in HDB\r\n\r\nestates.   In 1989, 28% out of the 125 neighbourhoods had\r\n\r\nat  least one ethnic group which reached or exceeded  the\r\n\r\nneighbourhood  limit.   Now,  there  are  25%   of   such\r\n\r\nneighbourhoods, although the number of neighbourhoods has\r\n\r\ngrown from 125 to 165.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between January and July this year, HDB received 181\r\n\r\nappeals  for waiver of EIP for resale of flat.  The  flat\r\n\r\nsellers appealed for waiver of EIP to widen their base of\r\n\r\npotential buyers in order to secure higher selling prices\r\n\r\nfor their flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them were selling their flats to buy another\r\n\r\nHDB   flat  or  private  property  while  some  indicated\r\n\r\nfinancial difficulty as the reason for the sale.  Only 7%\r\n\r\nappealed to waive the EIP for resale of their flat due to\r\n\r\ndivorce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the EIP is very important in maintaining racial\r\n\r\nharmony in Singapore, we have to apply it consistently.\r\n\r\nWaiver is granted on a very exceptional basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The EIP has worked well in forging ethnic\r\n\r\nintegration and harmony among HDB residents.  We will\r\n\r\nregularly review and refine the policy if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for Resumption of Debate on the Prime\r\n\r\nMinister's Statement [28th August, 2003].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank\r\n\r\nyou,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join  in  this\r\n\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few points to make on the recent\r\n\r\nannouncements on the CPF and I hope I will not repeat too\r\n\r\nmany points here.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I am of the opinion that the cut is not\r\n\r\ndeep enough if we are really trying to meet our objective\r\n\r\nas  spelt out in the Prime Minister's speech and that  of\r\n\r\nthe NTUC's chief, Mr Lim Boon Heng.  If our reason is  to\r\n\r\nmake  our workforce a more competitive lot from a  wages'\r\n\r\npoint of view, then I personally think that the cut could\r\n\r\nbe  deeper.   A  three  percentage  point  cut  can  save\r\n\r\nemployers  about $1.3 billion a year.  The bulk  of  this\r\n\r\nsaving  will be appreciated by the biggest employer,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and  the  Government-owned  companies.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment, as the Deputy Prime Minister has  said,  will\r\n\r\nsave $175 million through this cut.  Employers are mostly\r\n\r\ngrateful   but   also  cynical  that  these   cuts   will\r\n\r\nsignificantly  reduce  job losses  or  bring  in  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestments or stop the outflow of investments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the reality then, is this only a half\r\n\r\nmeasure?   It would be a sorry day if employers bite  the\r\n\r\nbullet only to make sacrifices for a short-term breather,\r\n\r\na  glitch on the globalisation radar screen.  If  we  are\r\n\r\nseriously  trying  to lure MNCs back  and  be  a  serious\r\n\r\ncontender against China and India, this CPF cut will only\r\n\r\nbuy   us   a  bit  of  time  and  slower  the   pace   on\r\n\r\nretrenchments.   But whether it will make  us  attractive\r\n\r\nenough is a moot point which I hope there will be further\r\n\r\nclarification on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the issue of land costs, DPM has\r\n\r\nalready  reassured that prices have fallen since 1994  by\r\n\r\nas  much as 41%.  But are we still cost competitive  with\r\n\r\nother  countries  around us?  We have  already  lost  big\r\n\r\nclients  to  Malaysia  and  the  very  example  cited  by\r\n\r\nMinister  Lim  Boon  Heng  of Philips  having  moved  its\r\n\r\nmanufacturing  plant  to Batam is also  another  case  in\r\n\r\npoint  -  cheaper land and labour costs in  Batam.   Land\r\n\r\ncosts,  I  think,  need  to be buffered  differently  for\r\n\r\ndifferent industries here.  As our retrenchments are most\r\n\r\ndeep  in  the  manufacturing sector then  it  is  equally\r\n\r\nimportant to see how land costs can be reduced  for  such\r\n\r\nindustries  to  carry  on their  work  in  Singapore  and\r\n\r\nprovide jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that if we aim to be the fashion\r\n\r\ncentre of the east, then the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nretail sector needs a helping hand too.  A Straits  Times\r\n\r\narticle last March showed that land costs for SMEs soaked\r\n\r\nup  between 5% and 10% for the manufacturing sector while\r\n\r\nthe  bill for the retail sector was between 40% and  50%.\r\n\r\nYes,  land costs are coming down but we need to  do  more\r\n\r\nand  be more creative too.  We cannot afford to have  any\r\n\r\nmore  white  elephants if we can help it.  An example  in\r\n\r\npoint  would be to help small businessmen who are looking\r\n\r\nfor  cheaper rentals.  Might it not be a better  idea  to\r\n\r\nrent  out the old HDB HQ at Bukit Merah at a much reduced\r\n\r\nprice   or   to  also  help  the  49  aspiring   business\r\n\r\nenthusiasts from the NTU's Technopreneurship Centre  that\r\n\r\nMr   Raymond  Lim  spoke  about  last  week?   These  are\r\n\r\nindividuals  who need a start-up hand or a  helping  hand\r\n\r\nwith cheaper rentals.  This Centre in Bukit Merah - right\r\n\r\nnow I am not sure whether it is white or cream-coloured - can  become  a bustling centre, perhaps even  called  the\r\n\r\nCreative Business Centre, and who knows, in time to come,\r\n\r\nwe  might  have a Sim Wong Hoo emerging with  all  credit\r\n\r\ngoing to HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to comment on the $1 billion\r\n\r\nrelief  package.  It brought on a great  sigh  of  relief\r\n\r\nthat  we do know that in spite of the cut, the people  in\r\n\r\ndifferent sectors will be taken care of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cut Waste Panel is an excellent idea and I hope\r\n\r\nthe  terms  of  reference here will  include  looking  at\r\n\r\nprocesses  and  schemes and not just the  smaller  items,\r\n\r\nthough  they are equally important.  Competition  between\r\n\r\nhealth clusters and among hospitals has driven costs  up,\r\n\r\nespecially  sometimes  in terms of  salary  packages  for\r\n\r\nclinicians.   Competition among schools has also  led  to\r\n\r\nmuch out-doing of each other in terms of event management\r\n\r\nor  brochure-ware  to  `sell' the  schools.   Competition\r\n\r\namong  departments and across Ministries has also  driven\r\n\r\nsmall launches into mini-stellar events.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The argument then that they are sponsored, in my\r\n\r\nopinion,  by corporate sponsors' money, does ring  hollow\r\n\r\nat  this point in time when this valuable money should go\r\n\r\ninto the coffers of Community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChest or any other charity that is crying out to help the\r\n\r\nless privileged in our country.  I am heartened that  the\r\n\r\ncivil service salaries will be reviewed as it is hard  to\r\n\r\nknow  right now which market is driving up whose salaries\r\n\r\n- the private driving up the public or the public driving\r\n\r\nup  the  private.   A  clear example has  been  given  by\r\n\r\nMinister  Lim  Boon  Heng last week on  the  benchmarking\r\n\r\nacross different work groups in that international  table\r\n\r\nthat he shared with us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On training, while we inject money to give more\r\n\r\ntraining  for  the vulnerable and the unemployed,  may  I\r\n\r\nalso  suggest  that we redesign the job scope  for  Human\r\n\r\nResource   Departments.   HRM  and  HRD  (human  resource\r\n\r\ndevelopment) in many companies are sometimes  functioning\r\n\r\nas  separate entities or entities with very loose  links.\r\n\r\nHRMs need to be agile, imaginative and visionary.  Often,\r\n\r\nthey are still functioning quite primarily as hirers  and\r\n\r\nfirers when globalisation demands a new order that  ought\r\n\r\nto   include  personalised  career  planning  portfolios,\r\n\r\nconstant job-redesigning and training.  They need  to  be\r\n\r\nahead of the curve like UPS and Hewlett Packard who  have\r\n\r\nconstantly redesigned jobs and offered the right kind  of\r\n\r\ntraining  so that retrenchment becomes hardly,  if  ever,\r\n\r\nnecessary.   It  is  an  irony  that  our  only   natural\r\n\r\nresources - the human being, the worker - are led by HRMs\r\n\r\nthat are sometimes not fast enough on the move and do not\r\n\r\nthemselves  have  a  clear job description  on  personnel\r\n\r\nenhancement,  processes and outcomes and to remain  ahead\r\n\r\nof the curve.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the aid schemes that were spelt out, I share Mr\r\n\r\nIswaran's  deep  concern on attitudes towards  people  in\r\n\r\nneed.   He has expressed his views so eloquently  that  I\r\n\r\nwill  just add this to the discussion - that as we render\r\n\r\naid to people in need we need to suspend our own judgment\r\n\r\nor sense of values.  None of us will ever know what it is\r\n\r\nlike  unless we walk in the other person's shoes, as what\r\n\r\nAtticus  said  in  the book \"To Kill a  Mockingbird\".   I\r\n\r\nthink  that is a lesson we can all remember when, through\r\n\r\nour  frustration, we start passing on some of  our  value\r\n\r\njudgments to the person in need.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is vital to implement aid schemes well,\r\n\r\nwith consistency and with expertise.  Mr Ahmad Magad  has\r\n\r\nalready   spoken   on   this  need  to   have   financial\r\n\r\ncounselling.  I would just push it a bit further  to  ask\r\n\r\nthat  it be a one-stop financial planning and counselling\r\n\r\nservice  to families in need such that what needs  to  be\r\n\r\ndone  can be mapped out against a time-line and  all  the\r\n\r\naid  schemes  that are being offered and  pegged  to  the\r\n\r\ntraining  that  they should be getting, plus  what  I  am\r\n\r\ncalling unofficially a \"de-tox programme\" to get  rid  of\r\n\r\nthe  problems that are stifling them or making them  more\r\n\r\ndysfunctional  year  by year.  With  this  time-line  and\r\n\r\nconstant monitoring, I think we will be able to get quite\r\n\r\na number of our various aid schemes under a proper system\r\n\r\nof implementation which eventually should have an outcome\r\n\r\nthat the family must move on and be better off.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a query on the help schemes. The HOPE and\r\n\r\nthe  Small Families Interim Assistance Schemes have  left\r\n\r\nthe  single  parents in the cold.  Then we ask  why  many\r\n\r\namong  the single mothers do remarry and sometimes go  on\r\n\r\nto  have  more children with their new spouses.  Most  of\r\n\r\nthem,  as  data would show, are in the low income  group.\r\n\r\nMany  are also home-makers.  Empowering such women  takes\r\n\r\ntime,  training them for jobs will take longer when there\r\n\r\nis  a conflicting demand on their time to look after  the\r\n\r\nchildren.   They  also have a strong patriarchal  mindset\r\n\r\nthat  men are the ones who should look after them.  Given\r\n\r\nall  these, it would be timely as social workers and VWOs\r\n\r\nwork and get on with the educational programmes for these\r\n\r\nsingle  parents.  We should also back this with political\r\n\r\nwill  to help them to understand that people do come from\r\n\r\ndifferent circumstances and not just review such cases on\r\n\r\na  case-by-case basis.  In short, to me, the HOPE  scheme\r\n\r\nand  the rental policy do lack the vision in helping such\r\n\r\nfamilies to get on and break out of the poverty cycle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the two most vulnerable groups, in my\r\n\r\nopinion, who are in our\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmidst.  We need to think more long-term for them so  that\r\n\r\nthey  do not become a social cost to the nation and their\r\n\r\nself-esteem is not compromised.   I thank the Ministry of\r\n\r\nManpower for giving me a very comprehensive reply  to  my\r\n\r\nQuestion  on active and inactive CPF holders.  From  that\r\n\r\ndata, there are 1.1 million inactive CPF account holders,\r\n\r\nof  whom  almost two-thirds are women.  Among the  active\r\n\r\naccount holders of 1.3 million male members, there  is  a\r\n\r\ngross  balance of about $110,000 while women  have  about\r\n\r\n$80,000.  Women tend to live longer than the men and they\r\n\r\nhave  much  less  in their CPF.  Many  have  dormant  CPF\r\n\r\naccounts as a result of unemployment or being employed in\r\n\r\nthe  informal sector or being home-makers.   We  need  to\r\n\r\nlook  into  the CPF scheme to prop this up  with  various\r\n\r\nschemes  that have been mentioned by Dr Jennifer  Lee  so\r\n\r\nthat  we  can help these women and help them through  the\r\n\r\nlater years of their life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask if the CPF Board would like\r\n\r\nto  consider perhaps an acknowledgment for this group  of\r\n\r\nwomen  who  hold  inactive  CPF  accounts  that  they  be\r\n\r\nnotified that their husbands are about to retrieve  their\r\n\r\nretirement  package so that at least they are  aware  how\r\n\r\nmuch  money their husbands have accumulated and also plan\r\n\r\nwith  them,  such that Batam becomes a figment  of  their\r\n\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group of people that I think we need to\r\n\r\npay  a little bit more attention to are the men and women\r\n\r\nin  their  late  40s to 50s - the sandwich generation  is\r\n\r\nwhat  we sometimes call them.  They have been responsible\r\n\r\nfamily  members  taking care of their  children,  parents\r\n\r\nand,  in  some  cases, grandparents.  The data  from  the\r\n\r\nManpower Ministry shows that men and women above 55  have\r\n\r\nan  average  net  balance of about  $30,000  and  $23,000\r\n\r\nrespectively.  I wonder what is going to be left for them\r\n\r\nto  see  through  their retirement and old  age.   Inter-generational transfer of CPF savings has led to  its  own\r\n\r\nerosion  for this group of account holders.  The  savings\r\n\r\nof  this group of people too need some kind of shoring up\r\n\r\nso that they can tend to their health concerns as well as\r\n\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would just like to say that in this whole\r\n\r\nCPF phenomenon, there is a whole group of people who have\r\n\r\nupgraded  themselves constantly and may be  caught  in  a\r\n\r\njam.   There have been reports in the papers of  some  of\r\n\r\nthem earning about $2,000 vying for or living in a 5-room\r\n\r\nflat, and wondering how they are going to cope.  While we\r\n\r\ntry and put in these packages, etc, for the current group\r\n\r\nwho  is  coming in, I think the financial counselling  at\r\n\r\nthe HDB end and at other various ends needs to be propped\r\n\r\nup  so  that  people  are very  much  in  the  know.   As\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, we too have to realise what  is  the  value\r\n\r\nsystem that we are holding on to that has just led us  to\r\n\r\nupgrade  and  upgrade, and now we are caught  in  not  so\r\n\r\nwonderful a position, in some cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Thank you, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to address the issue of whether\r\n\r\nwe have a real plan to address our economic woes and also\r\n\r\nhow  radical  have  we  been in  trying  to  address  our\r\n\r\neconomic  problems  that we are seeing  right  now.   The\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  mentioned that the CPF changes  are  the\r\n\r\nmost radical ever made for a long time, but, with all due\r\n\r\nrespect,  Sir,  I  do  not see the radical  part  of  the\r\n\r\nchanges.   The  lowering of the CPF rate by 3  percentage\r\n\r\npoints is but a minor adjustment, in my opinion.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the real issue is one of total cost. I would\r\n\r\nlike  to  take  up the analogy used by the  Deputy  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister, and that is, of the frog in the boiling  water.\r\n\r\nWhat  we  have done with the CPF reduction by 3% is  just\r\n\r\nlike  reducing  the heating device a little,  but  it  is\r\n\r\nhardly  the  cutting  of  all energy  sources  which  are\r\n\r\nboiling  the  water.  What we need are bold  moves  which\r\n\r\nwill  allow the frog to be energised to jump out  of  the\r\n\r\npot  of  water.  Or what we need is to cut  off  all  the\r\n\r\nenergy  sources that are boiling the water  so  that  the\r\n\r\nwater  never gets hot, and the frog will never die.   The\r\n\r\nchanges announced will just prolong our problems,  in  my\r\n\r\nopinion, because along with the CPF changes we need to do\r\n\r\nmany  other things.  The much needed radical changes  are\r\n\r\nnothing new and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhave  been brought up by many Members before and also  in\r\n\r\nthe House over the last few days.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are: (1) the various Government charges and\r\n\r\nfees;  (2)  the  cost of restructuring and retrenchments,\r\n\r\nwhich  can  discourage companies from wanting to  set  up\r\n\r\nbase  down  here.   And this is relevant  because  before\r\n\r\ncompanies come down here, they want to look at the  whole\r\n\r\nlife  cycle and the day that they have to leave  if  they\r\n\r\nhave  to  put  up  24 months of retrenchments,  it  could\r\n\r\ndiscourage them from coming into Singapore; (3)  rentals,\r\n\r\nutility charges, and many hidden taxes that I have talked\r\n\r\nabout   many  times;  and  (4)  the  cost  of  regulatory\r\n\r\ncompliance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the way back from USA yesterday, I read\r\n\r\nabout  DPM's  comments  that the Government  has  already\r\n\r\nadequately  addressed these cost issues.  While  I  agree\r\n\r\nthat something has been done, the changes are however not\r\n\r\nradical  enough.  What signals are we giving to employers\r\n\r\nand potential investors about the Government's resolve to\r\n\r\naddress the total cost issues in Singapore when we do not\r\n\r\ngo  far  enough  in  reducing the costs  related  to  the\r\n\r\nfactors that I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just take the cost of government as an\r\n\r\nexample.   The  cost of government directly  affects  the\r\n\r\nGovernment charges and fees and also sets the  stage  for\r\n\r\ncost  of doing business in Singapore.  The Government  is\r\n\r\nonly  now  realising that there needs to be a  cut  waste\r\n\r\nsystem  to  cut  waste  in Government.   In  my  opinion,\r\n\r\ncutting  waste  is  not good enough.  Waste,  of  course,\r\n\r\nshould  have been cut long time ago.  We also  need  real\r\n\r\ncost  reductions across the Government and its  agencies,\r\n\r\nand  not  just in the area of waste.  Even if it is  just\r\n\r\nwaste  reduction, it shows that cost can be brought  down\r\n\r\nsome  more.  I am confident that if we look at the  other\r\n\r\nfactors, we probably can find opportunities for more cost\r\n\r\nreductions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to relate my personal experience so\r\n\r\nthat  everyone  would  know that I am  not  just  talking\r\n\r\ntheory  down here.  I have started a number of companies.\r\n\r\nThe first major one was a semiconductor\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2867</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany  which  I started in 1998.  It is a manufacturing\r\n\r\nplant  that employs about 1,000 people in Singapore right\r\n\r\nnow.   When  I  started  it  in  1998,  I  believed  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  could still be competitive in  that  industry.\r\n\r\nThat  company  which  I  left,  because  it  was  already\r\n\r\nsuccessful  in its own right, is still around with  about\r\n\r\n1,000  employees but it is struggling to  be  competitive\r\n\r\nright now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the year 2001, I started another semiconductor\r\n\r\ncompany.   It now employs 1,500 employees but  of  these,\r\n\r\nonly  11 are in Singapore right now; 350 in the USA,  and\r\n\r\nmore  than  1,000  in the Philippines where  we  run  our\r\n\r\nproduction, and about 60 in India where we do our  design\r\n\r\nwork.   I  tried my best to justify the setting up  of  a\r\n\r\nproduction   facility  in  Singapore,   but   the   other\r\n\r\nalternatives like Thailand, the Philippines and  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwere  more  compelling.  I still hope to  create  another\r\n\r\n1,000 jobs in Singapore, but it must make sense and it is\r\n\r\nnot about National Service for us, because we have to  be\r\n\r\nalive  for a long time and the competition is fierce  and\r\n\r\nthe cost can be a killer in Singapore.  Had my management\r\n\r\nteam made the wrong decision of forcing ourselves to  set\r\n\r\nup  a  site  in  Singapore, we may not have  been  around\r\n\r\ntoday.   So, if the Government can address all  the  cost\r\n\r\nand  regulatory issues, I am confident that  operating  a\r\n\r\nlarge manufacturing site in Singapore for quite some time\r\n\r\nto  come  is  possible.  I know we  can  do  it,  if  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  gets the right formula implemented  for  cost\r\n\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second issue is one of CPF, whether it\r\n\r\nshould  be  compulsory  or  voluntary.   If  we  look  at\r\n\r\ncountries  which have gone through the same situation  as\r\n\r\nSingapore  before,  particularly the developed  countries\r\n\r\nthat  made their transition from not developed  to  being\r\n\r\ndeveloped, I am sure we can get some good ideas, and  one\r\n\r\nof  them  is  a  real  radical  move  to  make  CPF  less\r\n\r\ncompulsory.   Perhaps  we  can take  the  first  step  of\r\n\r\nbreaking  the  CPF  into  two  components  -  the  first,\r\n\r\ncompulsory;  and  the second, voluntary  -  supported  by\r\n\r\nGovernment   incentives   to  encourage   employers   and\r\n\r\nemployees to voluntarily\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsave  for  their retirement.  At a 40% compulsory  saving\r\n\r\nrate,  employers have the flexibility to adjust only  80%\r\n\r\nof  wages, which is what the employees take home.   Also,\r\n\r\nabout  one-third  of an employee's wage  is  compulsorily\r\n\r\nsaved,  thus reducing the amount available to  drive  the\r\n\r\nconsumption part of our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that we should move away from\r\n\r\nforcing   Singaporeans  and  their  employers  with   the\r\n\r\nstatutory and compulsory saving regime.  By all means, we\r\n\r\nshould   encourage  savings  for  the  future   and   for\r\n\r\nretirement, but let us make this a market-driven practice\r\n\r\nand the Government can play its part, not by forcing, but\r\n\r\nby incentivising.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth of the matter is that while the 3% CPF cut\r\n\r\nis  welcomed  by companies, but when the companies  faced\r\n\r\nthe  crunch  over  the last few years, they  had  already\r\n\r\ntaken  more aggressive moves like reducing wages by  10%,\r\n\r\n20% or some, even 30%, depending on what it took them  to\r\n\r\nsurvive in Singapore.  This is the flexible part  of  the\r\n\r\nwages,  while the CPF is the most inflexible part of  the\r\n\r\nwage system because it is dictated by the Government.  My\r\n\r\nopinion is that this issue of high forced saving rate  is\r\n\r\nwhat  is deterring companies from investing in Singapore.\r\n\r\nWe  have  to  change  and  follow  what  other  developed\r\n\r\ncountries  do,  and that is, to get away from  this  high\r\n\r\nforced   saving   rate   and,   therefore,   reduce   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's dominant role in determining the wage levels\r\n\r\nhere.   The market should be driving the decisions.   Let\r\n\r\nus really cut the apron strings.  Let us do away with the\r\n\r\nGovernment  determining wages.  Let us do away  with  the\r\n\r\nNational   Wages  Council,  which  is  another   way   of\r\n\r\nGovernment playing a dominant role in determining  wages.\r\n\r\nLet  it be market driven.  It worked in the past, but  it\r\n\r\nis  not  going to work in the future, in my opinion,  for\r\n\r\nthe  changes that we are trying to make.  The  sooner  we\r\n\r\nlearn this new paradigm, the more successful we will be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next issue is whether there is a plan for\r\n\r\nus  to  solve  all  our economic problems.   Why  is  the\r\n\r\nGovernment   pulling  its  punches?    Half-hearted   and\r\n\r\npiecemeal\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2869</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nchanges will prove counter-productive.  We need the right\r\n\r\nmixture  of  ingredients to produce  the  right  medicine\r\n\r\nwhich  can be administered in the right dosages  to  cure\r\n\r\nour  unemployment and economic problems.  In my  opinion,\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  changes  are  but just  one  of  the  component\r\n\r\ningredients  and are not the final medicine which  is  so\r\n\r\ngreatly  needed  right now.  And if  we  think  that  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges are going to solve all our problems, we are going\r\n\r\nto be mistaken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fear one thing - two years down the road,\r\n\r\nafter  we have implemented the CPF changes, we will still\r\n\r\nbe in the same position as today, because we did not make\r\n\r\nthe  other  necessary changes.  If we do not progress  by\r\n\r\nthen, Singaporeans will feel betrayed that the Government\r\n\r\ngave away their wages with no significant gain in return.\r\n\r\nCan we risk this happening in Singapore?  The answer must\r\n\r\nsurely be no.  I hope that the Government is right.  Time\r\n\r\nwill tell if I am wrong about my assessment, and I hope I\r\n\r\nam wrong in this case.  I urge the Government to reassess\r\n\r\nthe  situation  with  a  much open  mind.   Please  start\r\n\r\nbelieving the people and the private sector more,  and  I\r\n\r\nhope  that  we will find all the answers when  they  give\r\n\r\ntheir feedback.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People ask me: does the Government really have a\r\n\r\nplan to get Singapore out of the current set of problems?\r\n\r\nMany  feel that there is no real plan because CPF changes\r\n\r\nalone will not fix our problems.  This is the feedback  I\r\n\r\nhave been getting from the ground.  In this respect,  can\r\n\r\nI  ask  the  Prime Minister to share with the  House  the\r\n\r\nreasons   why  companies  are  packing  up  and   leaving\r\n\r\nSingapore?  Surely, it is not because the CPF is just  3%\r\n\r\ntoo  high.   I  am sure that there are many more  factors\r\n\r\nwhich  are forcing companies to pack up and leave.   What\r\n\r\nare  these factors and what are we doing about  them?   I\r\n\r\nknow  of  a few multi-national companies which are  still\r\n\r\nplanning  to exit Singapore today.  They are still  here,\r\n\r\nbut  they  are  planning  their exit.   The  momentum  of\r\n\r\ncompanies  leaving  Singapore has  not  slowed  down  and\r\n\r\nunless  and until we address the cost factors adequately,\r\n\r\nwe will continue to shed jobs and lose companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government can share with all of us what\r\n\r\nthese  exiting companies are saying, perhaps  we  can  be\r\n\r\nconvinced that there is a good plan in place and that  we\r\n\r\ncan solve all of our problems.  Currently, there are many\r\n\r\nsceptics - they are not yet convinced that we have a plan\r\n\r\nthat will work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to urge the leaders\r\n\r\nto  come  up with a convincing plan which can assure  and\r\n\r\nalso inspire the people of Singapore to rally around  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to solve all our economic woes.   It  is  not\r\n\r\njust  about  waiting and seeing the outcome a  few  years\r\n\r\nfrom now, but to give confidence to everyone that we  can\r\n\r\ndo  it.  I am convinced that if we take all the necessary\r\n\r\nradical steps, we can do it.  But I have not seen all the\r\n\r\nnecessary steps personally.  We need the Government to be\r\n\r\nbold  and  more entrepreneurial than what they have  done\r\n\r\nbefore.  I hope that we will not be disappointed and that\r\n\r\nthe  economy recovers fast enough so that jobs remain  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  the unemployment situation gets  resolved\r\n\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Defence (Mr Cedric Foo\r\n\r\nChee  Keng)  :   Mr  Speaker, Sir,  thank  you  for  this\r\n\r\nopportunity to join in the debate.  I would like to share\r\n\r\nmy  views,  especially from my perspective  as  Chairman,\r\n\r\nSPRING Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members of this House have pointed out that the\r\n\r\nbroader challenge confronting Singapore is not just about\r\n\r\nthe  retuning  of  the  Central Provident  Fund  but  how\r\n\r\nSingapore  can continue to be competitive in  the  global\r\n\r\nmarketplace.  It is about our ability to create good jobs\r\n\r\nso that Singaporeans can chase their Singapore dreams.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly discuss the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 3% CPF cut and the lowering of the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution ceiling are significant to tackle  our  wage\r\n\r\nrigidity  to respond to our immediate challenges  but  of\r\n\r\ngreater  significance are the changes that we are  making\r\n\r\nto  the  withdrawal rules and Minimum Sums.  The benefits\r\n\r\nof  these  CPF changes we are making now will largely  be\r\n\r\nfelt 10 years from now.  For the first\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntime,  the CPF and Medisave Minimum Sums will be adjusted\r\n\r\nfor  inflation.   They  will provide  a  basic  level  of\r\n\r\nfinancial security for retired Singaporeans.  Mr Inderjit\r\n\r\nSingh   suggested  that  perhaps  a  part  of   the   CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  should  be  made  voluntary.   However,  in\r\n\r\nreality,   it  is  not  so  simple.   Singapore's   Total\r\n\r\nFertility Rate (TFR) is at a 26-year low of 1.38.   Soon,\r\n\r\na  small base of young Singaporeans will be supporting  a\r\n\r\nvery  large  group  of retirees.  This \"inverse  pyramid\"\r\n\r\nwill  be  very  unstable  unless we  require  that  every\r\n\r\nSingaporean  put  aside  sufficient  funds  for  his  own\r\n\r\nhealthcare  and retirement needs.  Otherwise, the  burden\r\n\r\non our future generations will be untenable.  And at that\r\n\r\ntime,  taxes  will  have to increase.  Singapore  can  no\r\n\r\nlonger  be an attractive place to work or live in.   Many\r\n\r\nof  our  more  capable youths will be drawn to  countries\r\n\r\noffering lower taxes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to withdrawal rules and Minimum Sums\r\n\r\nwill  underpin Singapore's competitiveness for  the  long\r\n\r\nhaul and it is more significant than many have thought.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me move on to discuss what else may be needed\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore to enhance its competitiveness.   Lowering\r\n\r\nwage  cost  with  a  new  CPF rate  is  a  necessary  but\r\n\r\ninsufficient    condition   to   regain    our    overall\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.   From the perspective  of  labour  cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  alone,  the  odds  are  stacked  against\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The Prime Minister and Minister Lim Boon Heng\r\n\r\nhave  cited  the  wages  of  a  manufacturing  worker  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   compared  to  other  emerging  and  competing\r\n\r\neconomies.   To  top  it  all, the number  of  registered\r\n\r\nunemployed  in China's cities alone is 8 million  people.\r\n\r\nThe  US  State Department estimates that the total number\r\n\r\nof  unemployed  and under-employed in China  is  a  mind-boggling  350 million people!  These unemployed will  act\r\n\r\nas  a  buffer against any future wage increases in China.\r\n\r\nSo  China  will remain wage competitive for a long,  long\r\n\r\ntime.  There is no way we can match our wage cost \"dollar\r\n\r\nfor  dollar\" and \"cent for cent\" against these developing\r\n\r\ncountries.  And as DPM Lee has said, neither do we want\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  regress to such wage levels.  In fact, our  long-term\r\n\r\nobjective   should  be  to  raise  the   real   wage   of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  and  to keep the Singapore  dollar  strong.\r\n\r\nThese are ultimately the drivers that would determine the\r\n\r\nquality of life in Singapore.  But we cannot blindly push\r\n\r\nup  wages  unless it is supported by higher  productivity\r\n\r\nrelative   to   competing  economies.    Without   which,\r\n\r\nSingapore cannot retain or attract enough investments  to\r\n\r\nsustain our wage premium and to achieve full employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity improvement is the key to a nation's\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness.  And it is a marathon without  a  finish\r\n\r\nline.   Yet, we cannot let up.  Some have suggested  that\r\n\r\nwe  use  our foreign reserves to prop up the economy  and\r\n\r\nsupport our high living standard.  But for how long?  Our\r\n\r\nreserves are finite and can be depleted.  The way  I  see\r\n\r\nit,  productivity improvement is the only sustainable way\r\n\r\nfor us to support a higher quality of life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of recent retrenchments in Singapore,\r\n\r\nmost   notably   SIA  and  PSA,  many  Singaporeans   are\r\n\r\nunderstandably  concerned about loss of jobs.   There  is\r\n\r\nwidespread  belief  that  productivity  improvements  and\r\n\r\nemployment  creation runs counter to each other.   It  is\r\n\r\nargued that higher productivity leads to job destruction.\r\n\r\nOn  the  one  hand,  it is true that one  of  the  direct\r\n\r\neffects  of  productivity improvements in an industry  is\r\n\r\nthat  fewer workers are needed to produce the same amount\r\n\r\nof output.  But this view is too simplistic.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, in a competitive environment, lower cost\r\n\r\nof  production, as a result of higher productivity,  will\r\n\r\nlead  to lower prices for the products and will stimulate\r\n\r\nhigher  demand  and  therefore more  products  are  sold.\r\n\r\nSoon,  higher  capacity  is  needed  and  more  jobs  are\r\n\r\ncreated.    Even   if  the  productivity   surplus   were\r\n\r\ndistributed  to  shareholders,  such  surplus   will   be\r\n\r\ninvested  in other sectors of the economy or  end  up  as\r\n\r\nhigher  consumption.  All these lead to higher employment\r\n\r\noverall.   The economic development in the US bears  this\r\n\r\nout.   In  the  1990s, productivity and total  employment\r\n\r\nwere both growing\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  tandem  at  high rates.  For Singapore,  productivity\r\n\r\ngrowth  rates  averaged  3.5% per  annum  throughout  the\r\n\r\n1990s.   During  this period, total employment  increased\r\n\r\nfrom 1.54 million in 1990 to 2.09 million in 2000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies have performed commendably in\r\n\r\ntheir productivity quest.  Let me just cite two examples,\r\n\r\none  in  the  70s and a more recent one.   In  1975,  SBS\r\n\r\nintroduced  computerisation of the ticketing  system  and\r\n\r\ndid   away  with  bus  conductors.   They  went  One-Man-Operation  (OMO).  Productivity doubled.  You  need  only\r\n\r\nthe  driver.   Then they went on to operate double-decked\r\n\r\nbuses  with  twice  the capacity but with  the  same  one\r\n\r\ndriver.   Productivity doubled again.  Trans-Island  also\r\n\r\noperates  the \"bendy\" - a stretched ultra-long  bus  with\r\n\r\nhigher   labour   productivity.    If   not   for   their\r\n\r\nproductivity efforts, the recent transport fare increases\r\n\r\nwould be much heftier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other example concerns our cinemas. In cinemas\r\n\r\nof  the  past,  at least one usher was used for  checking\r\n\r\ntickets  at each entry point.  All employees were single-tasked.  One is either the cashier, or the usher, or  the\r\n\r\nsnack  bar  attendant.   In new  multiplex  cinemas,  the\r\n\r\nlayout is designed for only one ticket checkpoint for all\r\n\r\ncinemas  and it is located near the snack bar.   So  that\r\n\r\nthe jobs of ticketing, ushering and snack bar tending can\r\n\r\nbe  combined into a single category.  These changes  have\r\n\r\nenabled Golden Village to save about 40% in labour cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity can be achieved in two basic ways.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  companies can reduce input for a given  output,\r\n\r\nwhich means consolidating to leverage on scale or improve\r\n\r\noperational   performance.    Secondly,   companies   can\r\n\r\nincrease  output  with a given input;  which  is  a  less\r\n\r\ntravelled  path.   This means selling  higher-valued  and\r\n\r\nmore  innovative goods or selling more goods to  increase\r\n\r\ncapacity utilisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When manufacturing cost index is adjusted for\r\n\r\nproductivity,  Singapore  companies  fared  rather  well.\r\n\r\nSingapore   compares   very  well  with   the   competing\r\n\r\neconomies.  The World Competitiveness\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2874</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYearbook 2003 puts Singapore (with index of 100) as  more\r\n\r\ncompetitive than China (with a manufacturing  cost  index\r\n\r\nadjusted  for  productivity  of  113),  India  (122)  and\r\n\r\nMalaysia  (156).   However, Singapore still  lags  behind\r\n\r\nThailand (which has an index of 70.4).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the measures announced by DPM Lee, SPRING\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  administer  the  $45  million   Domestic\r\n\r\nCluster Development Fund.  The primary objective  of  the\r\n\r\nfund is to raise the productivity of our domestic sector.\r\n\r\nThe  fund  will  provide assistance for the  engaging  of\r\n\r\nconsultants    for   Business   Process   Re-engineering,\r\n\r\ntraining,  the  purchase  of equipment  and  intellectual\r\n\r\nproperty rights costs.  It will help innovation diffusion\r\n\r\nwithin   cluster,   thereby  raising   overall   industry\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of SPRING's current priorities is to see how we\r\n\r\ncan  create jobs for Singaporeans through work re-design,\r\n\r\nwhich Ms Braema Mathi talked about.  As Minister Lim Boon\r\n\r\nHeng  said, Singaporeans may need to take up some of  the\r\n\r\njobs  currently  performed by  foreign  workers.   If  we\r\n\r\nmerely  replace  a foreign worker with a Singaporean,  we\r\n\r\nare  unlikely  to  succeed.  The  job  content  currently\r\n\r\nperformed  by  the foreign worker is low and  these  jobs\r\n\r\ntypically   pay   low  wages.   I  can  understand   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will not take up such jobs as  they  do  not\r\n\r\npay  enough even for meals and transport.  Well, why  not\r\n\r\njust pay the Singaporean more for the same job?  If we do\r\n\r\nso,  we  will  be paying more for exactly  the  same  job\r\n\r\ncontent,  which  means  that the productivity  level  has\r\n\r\nfallen.   Someone has to pay for it; either in  terms  of\r\n\r\nhigher prices by consumers or higher taxes by taxpayers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A better solution would be to redesign the jobs,\r\n\r\npossibly with the application of technology.  If  we  can\r\n\r\nenlarge  and  value-add to the job, these jobs  can  then\r\n\r\ncommand  higher wages and be attractive to  Singaporeans.\r\n\r\nOne  good  example is the cleaner's job at  the  upgraded\r\n\r\nZion  Riverside  Food  Centre.  Our National  Environment\r\n\r\nAgency  (NEA)  has redesigned these jobs.   The  cleaners\r\n\r\nthere now draw\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbetween  $1,000 and $1,400 a month (with overtime)  which\r\n\r\nis  much higher than the $800 that cleaners usually earn.\r\n\r\nThese cleaners had been trained under the National Skills\r\n\r\nRecognition  System.   They  wear  smart  uniforms,   use\r\n\r\nspecially  designed trolleys and the plates and  utensils\r\n\r\nare  washed at a centralised location.  We could also use\r\n\r\ndish  washing machines to enhance the efficiency further.\r\n\r\nAlthough each stall now contributes $200 a month, instead\r\n\r\nof  $150 a month, towards cleaning, the centre now serves\r\n\r\nabout  500  customers  a day compared  to  150  customers\r\n\r\npreviously.  Stallholders appreciate the faster  cleaning\r\n\r\ncycle and customers enjoy cleaner tables and plates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that there is scope to redesign work in\r\n\r\nother  domestic sectors, like food and beverage,  retail,\r\n\r\nhealthcare,     domestic/commercial     cleaning      and\r\n\r\nconstruction.  The Domestic Cluster Development Fund will\r\n\r\nbe used to seek out such opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING also administers the LETAS (Local Enterprise\r\n\r\nTechnical  Assistance Scheme) and LEFS (Local  Enterprise\r\n\r\nFinance  Scheme) to help small and medium enterprises  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   improve   their  productivity.    Since   the\r\n\r\nprogrammes'  inception  in 1986 and  1976,  respectively,\r\n\r\nSPRING has given out $481 million in LETAS grants and has\r\n\r\nhelped  local  companies  raise  $8.6  billion  of  loans\r\n\r\nthrough LEFS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING conducted a survey of Singapore SMEs recently\r\n\r\non  their views towards the announced changes in the CPF.\r\n\r\nAn  SME, Aceford (a vegetable oil manufacturer) indicated\r\n\r\nthat they are prepared to channel the CPF savings back to\r\n\r\nemployees.   Many SMEs, like \"The Lighting Centre\",  said\r\n\r\nthat  they  were prepared to help their employees  should\r\n\r\nthey  face financial difficulties as a result of the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges.   These  companies see the need to  continue  to\r\n\r\nreward talent.  They understood that successful companies\r\n\r\npay   attention   to   all  stakeholders   (shareholders,\r\n\r\nsuppliers, managers, employees and the community\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nat  large)  rather than narrowly focusing  on  short-term\r\n\r\nshareholder value.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the SMEs remarked that their staff should\r\n\r\nnot  be overly concerned with the CPF changes.  In  fact,\r\n\r\nthey  said  that  the impact of the CPF  cut  is  minimal\r\n\r\nbecause  they  already have in place reward systems  that\r\n\r\nare  linked  to  performance.   Thus,  when  the  company\r\n\r\nperforms  well, contributing employees will end  up  with\r\n\r\nsignificantly higher income, despite the CPF  cut.   Such\r\n\r\nperformance-linked reward systems are to be encouraged as\r\n\r\nthey  ensure  that wage growth lags productivity  growth.\r\n\r\nOn  the other hand, companies with seniority-based  wages\r\n\r\nare at risk of becoming marginalised.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent Singapore businessman recently visited a\r\n\r\nDVD  factory  in  China and recounted  his  observations.\r\n\r\nThis  factory produces 8% of the world's DVD output.   To\r\n\r\nhis  surprise,  the factory is fully automated  with  the\r\n\r\nlatest  technology  comparable  even  to  those  in   the\r\n\r\ndeveloped  world,  like the United States.   The  factory\r\n\r\nproduces  a  small number of good jobs but  have  avoided\r\n\r\nemploying a large number of production line workers, even\r\n\r\nthough  labour is cheap and in abundance in  China.   The\r\n\r\nfactory owners did not merely resort to cheap labour  but\r\n\r\nhave  set their sights much further, for much bigger  and\r\n\r\nmore  sustainable  growth.   The  jobs  created  by  this\r\n\r\nfactory will pay well and will continue to be around  for\r\n\r\nmuch  longer than traditional labour intensive production\r\n\r\nlines.   The  productivity level is  very  high  and  the\r\n\r\nconsistency  of  high  quality DVDs assured  through  the\r\n\r\napplication of modern technology.  And this is  happening\r\n\r\neven in China!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a harsh economic world made harsher\r\n\r\nthrough  globalisation  and as we speak,  insurgents  are\r\n\r\ndrawing  out plans to out-do the established players  and\r\n\r\nunless  companies  in  Singapore, including  our  leading\r\n\r\ncompanies,   continue   to   innovate   and   up    their\r\n\r\nproductivity, more Singaporeans may lose their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on employers to work with SPRING to improve\r\n\r\nthe  industry's productivity.  And, if retrenchments  are\r\n\r\ninevitable, the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  as DPM Lee has assured, will  re-double  its\r\n\r\nefforts  to  help place retrenched workers in  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nWorkers,  on  their part, must adjust their  expectations\r\n\r\nand be prepared to help themselves.  Some jobs will never\r\n\r\nreturn,  so  continuous lifelong  learning  is  the  only\r\n\r\nguarantee of continued employability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already heard a frog story from DPM Lee on\r\n\r\nFriday.   I  have  another story  about  frogs  which  is\r\n\r\nadapted from a movie, \"Catch me if you can\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two frogs fell into a deep cream bowl. One was an\r\n\r\noptimistic soul, but the other took the gloomy view.  \"We\r\n\r\nwill  drown,\" he lamented without much ado,  and  with  a\r\n\r\nlast  despairing  cry, he flung up  his  legs  and  said,\r\n\r\n\"Goodbye.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quote the other frog with a steadfast grin:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"I cannot get out but I would not give in. I will\r\n\r\njust  swim around till my strength is spent, then I  will\r\n\r\ndie  the  more content.\"  Bravely, he swam  to  work  his\r\n\r\nscheme, and his struggles began to churn the cream.   The\r\n\r\nmore  he  swam,  his legs a flutter, the more  the  cream\r\n\r\nturned  into solid butter.  On top of the butter at  last\r\n\r\nhe stopped, and out of the bowl he gaily hopped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The going will be tough and it is difficult to\r\n\r\npredict  how  long we would have to keep  swimming.  But,\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must have the same indomitable spirit as the\r\n\r\nsecond  frog.   Our fortitude and strength  in  adversity\r\n\r\nwill  see  us  through these trying times.  We  will  not\r\n\r\ndrown  like the first frog.  Some may need help to  swim.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  will  provide  the  life  jackets,  but\r\n\r\nSingaporeans must continue to churn the cream.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite our competitive lifestyle, Singapore is\r\n\r\nstill  held up as a compassionate society.  In Singapore,\r\n\r\nno   one   will  go  homeless,  no  one  will  be  denied\r\n\r\nhealthcare,  and no child goes without an education.   If\r\n\r\nwe  press  on  with  the  CPF  changes  and  productivity\r\n\r\nimprovements, we will soon hop out.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister\r\n\r\nhas spelt out how the CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsystem  will  be  restructured for Singapore's  long-term\r\n\r\neconomic competitiveness.

But,\r\n\r\nfirst,  let me give an overview of the impact of the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges  on  HDB flat owners and buyers.   This  was  the\r\n\r\nresult  of  a  study which HDB did after the CPF  changes\r\n\r\nwere announced.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the impact on existing mortgagors.\r\n\r\nThere  are roughly 800,000 HDB households - to be  exact,\r\n\r\nabout  795,000.   Out of these, 530,000 have  outstanding\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans  with HDB.  Of these, 82%  service  their\r\n\r\nloans  using  CPF  funds.  Before  the  cut  in  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution  rates, there were about 200,000  households\r\n\r\nwith  shortfalls.   In  other words,  their  monthly  CPF\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account (OA) contributions were not  enough  to\r\n\r\nmeet  their  monthly housing instalments.  With  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncut,  this  number  will increase by  45,000  to  roughly\r\n\r\n245,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large majority will be able to cope using their\r\n\r\naccumulated CPF savings.  However, about 35,000  or  4.5%\r\n\r\nor  thereabouts of all HDB households may not have enough\r\n\r\nCPF   OA  and  Special  Account  (SA)  contributions  and\r\n\r\nbalances  to  completely service their HDB housing  loans\r\n\r\nbeyond  a  year.  So, these households, ie,  about  4.5%,\r\n\r\nwill   have  to  top  up  a  small  percentage  of  their\r\n\r\nrepayments using other savings or cash.  That is for  the\r\n\r\nexisting mortgagors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about new flat buyers? The cuts in CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rates will have a minimal impact on new  HDB\r\n\r\nflat  buyers,  especially  the younger  households.   HDB\r\n\r\nestimates  that the time required for new flat buyers  to\r\n\r\naccumulate  the 20% down payment using their CPF  savings\r\n\r\nwill  increase  by six to eight months, after  the  cuts.\r\n\r\nThe  total  time required to accumulate the down  payment\r\n\r\nremains at about four years.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will also be minimal impact on the ability of\r\n\r\nnew  flat buyers to service their mortgage loans.   Those\r\n\r\nbelow  50 will need to use about 19-23% of their  monthly\r\n\r\nhousehold  income to service their mortgage loans.   This\r\n\r\nis  quite close to the revised OA contribution of between\r\n\r\n18-22%  for this age group.  So, 19-23% of their  monthly\r\n\r\nincome,  after the cuts, compared to the CPF contribution\r\n\r\nof around 18-22%, ie, roughly about the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Short-term assistance and downgrading measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while these numbers show quite clearly that the\r\n\r\nimpact  on  both existing HDB owners and new flat  buyers\r\n\r\nwill be minimal, I can understand the sense of unease and\r\n\r\nanxiety  among them.  After all, the HDB flat  is,  to  a\r\n\r\nlarge  extent, probably the single largest  purchase  and\r\n\r\nasset of many Singaporeans.  So, their concerns have been\r\n\r\nvoiced  by many MPs in this House - Mr Zainul Abidin,  Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah Nandan, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Mdm Ho Geok Choo, among\r\n\r\nothers - who have all asked how HDB can help them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, HDB lessees having trouble servicing\r\n\r\ntheir  monthly loan instalments due to the CPF  cuts  can\r\n\r\napply for several existing financial assistance measures.\r\n\r\nThese include:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) extending the mortgage loan repayment up to a\r\n\r\nmaximum of 30 years, subject to the age limit of  65;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) conversion to a Reduce Repayment Scheme, ie,\r\n\r\nmortgagors  can apply to temporarily pay a lower  monthly\r\n\r\nsum  ranging from 50-75% of their normal instalments, and\r\n\r\nthis will help their cash flow;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) they can opt for short-term deferment of the\r\n\r\npayment of the loan instalments;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) they can apply to pay their loan arrears by\r\n\r\ninstalments; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) they can apply to include other family members\r\n\r\nas co-owners, so that\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthese  family  members  can  help  them  to  service  the\r\n\r\nmortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, apart from the financial assistance\r\n\r\nmeasures  that I have outlined, HDB lessees  affected  by\r\n\r\nthe CPF cut can also draw on their SA savings to meet the\r\n\r\nshortfall in repayment after their savings in the OA have\r\n\r\nbeen  depleted.  Since 1999, when these schemes were  put\r\n\r\nin  place,  HDB has assisted a total of 83,000 households\r\n\r\nunder  its  various financial assistance measures.   Over\r\n\r\nthe  same period, 92,000 individual HDB flat owners  used\r\n\r\ntheir SA savings to finance their housing loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the issue of downgrading. Many\r\n\r\nMPs  have  argued in this House that this is  a  sensible\r\n\r\noption  for lessees who are in financial hardship.   They\r\n\r\ncan sell their existing flat and they can downgrade to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  flat.   I agree.  However, they have  to  occupy\r\n\r\ntheir  flat for a minimum occupation period (MOP)  before\r\n\r\nthey can do so.  Several MPs have asked HDB to waive  the\r\n\r\nMOP period for resale.  I want to assure Members that HDB\r\n\r\nwill do so for deserving cases.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members like Mr Yeo Guat Kwang have also asked\r\n\r\nHDB  to  facilitate  downgrading for those  in  financial\r\n\r\nhardship.  Today, the policy is not to grant a second HDB\r\n\r\nconcessionary  loan  to those who are  downgrading  to  a\r\n\r\nsmaller flat.  The purpose behind this policy is to limit\r\n\r\nthe  amount  of  subsidised loans  given  out,  as  these\r\n\r\ndowngraders  would  usually  have  sufficient  funds   to\r\n\r\nfinance  the  purchase  of  the  smaller  flat.   I   say\r\n\r\n\"usually\", and this is generally true.  And HDB does  not\r\n\r\nintend to change this policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the HDB will exercise flexibility and grant\r\n\r\na  second  concessionary loan to downgraders who  are  in\r\n\r\nsevere    financial   hardship   arising   from   certain\r\n\r\ncircumstances.  These include retrenchments,  severe  pay\r\n\r\ncuts,  business failures, prolonged illness or  death  of\r\n\r\nthe  sole  breadwinner and so on.   The  quantum  of  the\r\n\r\nconcessionary loan will be capped at the outstanding loan\r\n\r\nfor  the  existing flat.  So, if they currently  have  an\r\n\r\noutstanding loan, that quantum will be the quantum\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  new  loan, or it will be 80%  of  the  value  or\r\n\r\npurchase price of the next flat, whichever is the lowest.\r\n\r\nThis  temporary measure will help lessees cope  with  the\r\n\r\nCPF changes and the economic downturn during this period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subject of flexibility, please allow me\r\n\r\nto  take a little detour at this stage and comment  on  a\r\n\r\ncase  which  seems  to have attracted  a  little  bit  of\r\n\r\nattention  recently.  I refer of course to  the  case  of\r\n\r\nthis  car wash company whose application to set up a  car\r\n\r\nwashing  business in HDB high-rise carparks was initially\r\n\r\nrejected.  And last week in this House, Ms Indranee Rajah\r\n\r\ncited  this case, arguing for the use of common sense  by\r\n\r\nGovernment departments.  She noted that HDB rejected  the\r\n\r\nidea  because \"It had not been done before\".   She  added\r\n\r\nthat if we use that kind of reason, we will never be able\r\n\r\nto do anything new.  I agree with her.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought this was quite out of character for HDB,\r\n\r\nso  I  checked.   Now, I am pleased  to  set  the  record\r\n\r\nstraight  and inform Ms Indranee that HDB did not  reject\r\n\r\nthe  idea because \"it had not been done before\";  rather,\r\n\r\nit  had  valid  environmental and safety  concerns.   For\r\n\r\nexample,  there were concerns over the improper discharge\r\n\r\nof   chemicals  and  washing  detergents  which,  if  not\r\n\r\nproperly  handled, would have ended up in our reservoirs.\r\n\r\nAs  Members  know, there are certain bays in  HDB  multi-storey  carparks where the discharge goes into the sewage\r\n\r\nsystem instead of into the open drains.  So, this was one\r\n\r\nconcern.   There  were also concerns that  the  prolonged\r\n\r\nwashing  in  the  HDB carparks may affect  the  flooring,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  not properly waterproofed, and may affect  the\r\n\r\nstructure  of  the carparks.  But once HDB was  satisfied\r\n\r\nthat  these concerns could be properly addressed  through\r\n\r\ncertain  measures, it issued the licence for the car-wash\r\n\r\ncompany  very  expeditiously.  So, it had a happy  ending\r\n\r\nand  I thought, far from illustrating a tardy, inflexible\r\n\r\nHDB,  the  episode  did  show a  careful,  practical  and\r\n\r\nflexible approach to administration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us come back to mortgage loans. There have been\r\n\r\nother suggestions by members of the public on how we can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  homeowners with their mortgage loans, and I thought\r\n\r\nI  should also take this opportunity to address  some  of\r\n\r\nthem.    One  suggestion  was  for  HDB  to  reduce   its\r\n\r\nconcessionary  interest rate of 2.6%.  As  Members  know,\r\n\r\nHDB  gets the funds for its concessionary loans from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  at  the CPF Ordinary Account  interest  rate,\r\n\r\nwhich is currently at the statutory minimum of 2.5%.  The\r\n\r\nadditional  0.1% is to defray HDB's cost of administering\r\n\r\nthe  loans.   So, if we want to cut the HDB concessionary\r\n\r\nloan  interest rate, we would, first of all, have to  cut\r\n\r\nthe  CPF Ordinary Account interest rate.  This would mean\r\n\r\nlower  retirement savings for all members, regardless  of\r\n\r\nwhether  they have outstanding HDB loans.   And  I  think\r\n\r\nMembers will agree that this is not a good idea.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion was for homeowners to stretch the\r\n\r\ntenure  of  their  mortgages.   Under  current  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  schemes, HDB mortgagors  can  already  extend\r\n\r\ntheir mortgage loan to a maximum of 30 years, subject  to\r\n\r\na  65-year  age  limit.  So, the question is  whether  we\r\n\r\nshould  allow mortgagors to extend their loans beyond  30\r\n\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think this is either necessary or\r\n\r\nhelpful  because, in the first place, there  are  already\r\n\r\nmany  ways  to assist HDB mortgagors who are in financial\r\n\r\ndifficulty.   As I have explained earlier, we  can  allow\r\n\r\nthem  to pay a reduced loan instalment, we can even allow\r\n\r\nthem  to temporarily defer their loan payments, which  is\r\n\r\nreally tantamount to stretching the mortgage payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, of course, if we were to really give them\r\n\r\na   longer   loan  repayment  period,  this  would   mean\r\n\r\nadditional interest cost for them and, in some cases,  it\r\n\r\nwould actually mean a higher mortgage instalment payment.\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to reassure the House that  HDB  will  do\r\n\r\nwhatever it can to help existing mortgagors who  will  be\r\n\r\naffected by the CPF cuts.  No HDB flat lessee who  is  in\r\n\r\ngenuine  financial  difficulty will lose  his  flat  just\r\n\r\nbecause  of the cut in CPF rates.  HDB will work  closely\r\n\r\nwith  them to advise them on the appropriate measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp them service their mortgage loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Long-term measures</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what I have outlined are the short-term HDB assistance measures. I would now like to talk\r\n\r\nabout  the  long-term measures in the HDB policies  which\r\n\r\nhave been announced by DPM last Friday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main social objectives of the CPF scheme\r\n\r\nis  home  ownership.   Our public housing  programme  has\r\n\r\ngiven  Singaporeans a good home, and a  strong  sense  of\r\n\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, in our National Day goody-bag, we\r\n\r\nreceived  a  little book entitled, \"Things that  make  us\r\n\r\nSingaporean\".   It  is  an  inspiring  little  book.   It\r\n\r\ncaptures the feelings of Singaporeans about Singapore and\r\n\r\nwhat  they feel connects them to this place.  Let me read\r\n\r\nto  you two of my favourites.  On page 16, Mr Andrew  Bok\r\n\r\nsaid, \"Being Singaporean is when I say, 'Let's apply  for\r\n\r\na  flat'  and  my  girlfriend knows straightaway  what  I\r\n\r\nmean\".   I  do  not think you can say that in  any  other\r\n\r\nplace in the world.  On page 21, below a picture of an NS\r\n\r\nman   sitting  in  a  3-tonner,  Mr  Lau  Wai  Leong,   a\r\n\r\npharmacist,  said: \"Looking out from a  3-tonner  at  the\r\n\r\nnight  lights of a HDB estate, and thinking:  it's  worth\r\n\r\ndoing  this  for  my country and my fellow Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\nThe  HDB flat and National Service - these are two of the\r\n\r\nmost  enduring experiences of being a Singaporean - aptly\r\n\r\ncaptured in one sentiment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Members have suggested that the Government\r\n\r\nre-look its public housing policies, like universal  home\r\n\r\nownership   and  upgrading.   I  agree  that  we   should\r\n\r\nregularly  review our policies.  Indeed, I have explained\r\n\r\nmany  times  in  this  House that my  Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nreviewing various HDB policies to ensure that our  public\r\n\r\nhousing  programmes remain relevant to meet the needs  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  At the same time, it must be in line  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government's  overall direction to  restructure  the\r\n\r\neconomy and remake our society.  But, even as we  do  so,\r\n\r\nwe  should  be mindful of the powerful role that  it  has\r\n\r\nplayed in nation-building, and giving\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingaporeans,  like Mr Lau, a stake in our  progress  and\r\n\r\nprosperity,  and something worth fighting for.   I  shall\r\n\r\nnow  outline  some  of  the changes  arising  from  these\r\n\r\nreviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Subletting of whole HDB flat</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are relaxing the subletting rules for HDB\r\n\r\nflats.  Let me explain the rationale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our economy and society are changing. In the new\r\n\r\neconomy, there will be more workers who are on short-term\r\n\r\nemployment, entrepreneurs without a steady income  stream\r\n\r\nand  young  couples  who are not ready  to  commit  to  a\r\n\r\nproperty  purchase.  As our people become more  educated,\r\n\r\nthey  want to take greater responsibility, to make  their\r\n\r\nown   choices  and  be  self-reliant.   This  is  to   be\r\n\r\nencouraged.   And with greater individual responsibility,\r\n\r\nrules and regulations can also be relaxed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many Singaporeans, their HDB flat is their\r\n\r\nsingle  most  valuable asset.  However, we  know  of  the\r\n\r\noften-quoted  syndrome of being \"asset  rich\"  but  \"cash\r\n\r\npoor\".   Some  flat  owners really feel  this.   As  flat\r\n\r\nowners  grow  old, they want to have more flexibility  to\r\n\r\nconvert  their  housing assets into cash to  provide  for\r\n\r\nretirement.   Others may want to seek to generate  income\r\n\r\nfrom the flats because they are in financial difficulties\r\n\r\nas  the  economy  restructures.   My  Ministry  has  been\r\n\r\nstudying  how  we  can help Singaporeans better  monetise\r\n\r\ncash out on their flats, while ensuring that there is  no\r\n\r\nabuse  of Government subsidies - do not forget HDB  flats\r\n\r\nare  very  heavily subsidised - in order to promote  home\r\n\r\nownership.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, we introduced bank origination of HDB\r\n\r\nmarket  rate loans, another way to give HDB lessees  more\r\n\r\nchoice.  And, at the same time, we relaxed the subletting\r\n\r\nrules for HDB flat buyers who took these bank loans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided to further free up the subletting\r\n\r\nrules.  From 1st October 2003, lessees of all HDB  flats,\r\n\r\nwho have occupied their flats for 15 years or more,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwill be able to sublet them, irrespective of whether they\r\n\r\nare  resale  flats or subsidised flats  with  or  without\r\n\r\noutstanding loans from HDB.  In addition, those who  have\r\n\r\noccupied  their flat for 10 years can sublet  their  flat\r\n\r\nimmediately if they do not have any outstanding HDB loan.\r\n\r\nThis  move  will make about 250,000 flats, or about  one-third or 30% of all flats, eligible to be rented out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may ask why this restriction of 10 or 15 years?\r\n\r\nWhy   not   5  years?  Why  not  remove  the  restriction\r\n\r\naltogether?   We  must bear in mind that  the  Government\r\n\r\nsells  subsidised HDB flats for owner occupation.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  for  speculation.  It is not, in the first instance,\r\n\r\nfor  income generation.  So the minimum occupation period\r\n\r\nof  10 or 15 years serves to maintain the long-term owner\r\n\r\noccupation principle of our home ownership policy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the relaxation, lessees will be able to\r\n\r\ngenerate income from their flats, without having to  sell\r\n\r\nthem.   Retirees will be able to rent their HDB flats  to\r\n\r\ngenerate  cash  to supplement their monthly  income  from\r\n\r\nCPF.  If you look at the current rental rates, even if we\r\n\r\nallow for some reduction in the rental rates, the rentals\r\n\r\ncan  form  a  very  significant part of their  retirement\r\n\r\nincome.   We  are  talking about anything  from  $800  to\r\n\r\n$1,500 to rent an HDB flat.  Then again, those who are in\r\n\r\nfinancial  difficulties can also generate some income  to\r\n\r\ntide them over their problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the assistance to HDB lessees, this move\r\n\r\nwill  also  enlarge the rental market for HDB  flats  and\r\n\r\nkeep rentals reasonable.  It will open up another housing\r\n\r\noption  for those who are either not ready to buy or  who\r\n\r\nare  not able to afford a flat or who do not wish  to  be\r\n\r\ntied  down  by  a  mortgage at a certain point  in  their\r\n\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To preserve the good environment of our housing\r\n\r\nestates  and  to minimise nuisances that may  arise  from\r\n\r\nsubletting,   HDB  will  apply  certain  guidelines   and\r\n\r\nconditions  for  subletting.  It will also  work  closely\r\n\r\nwith  grassroots  organisations and residents  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  subletting does not impact negatively on the living\r\n\r\nambience of our HDB estates.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Extending the Public Rental Scheme</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always encouraged near universal\r\n\r\nhome  ownership and it has been successful.  85%  of  our\r\n\r\npeople  live  in HDB flats, 95% of them own their  homes.\r\n\r\nHowever, as our economy restructures, there will be  some\r\n\r\nlow-income  households who may have difficulty sustaining\r\n\r\nhome  ownership. For them, subsidised rental housing  may\r\n\r\nbe  a  better option until such time that they are  ready\r\n\r\nand  can  afford to buy an HDB flat.  Today, the  monthly\r\n\r\nhousehold income ceiling to rent subsidised HDB flats  is\r\n\r\n$800.  Many Members, including Dr Maliki and Ms Irene Ng,\r\n\r\nhave asked for the eligibility criteria to be expanded so\r\n\r\nthat more can benefit from subsidised rental housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As DPM announced last Friday, from 1st October 2003,\r\n\r\nthe  monthly income cut-off for the Public Rental  Scheme\r\n\r\nwill  be  raised to $1,500.  The rents charged  for  this\r\n\r\nsecond tier of households earning $801 to $1,500 will  be\r\n\r\nhigher  than  those earning $800 or less, but  they  will\r\n\r\nstill  be  very  heavily subsidised and very  affordable.\r\n\r\nFor  this second tier, the rents are between $90 and $110\r\n\r\nfor  a 1-room flat and between $120 and $150 for a 2-room\r\n\r\nflat.   This roughly works out to around 10%, or  between\r\n\r\n9%  and 12% of the average household income of those  who\r\n\r\nare eligible for these flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this move will make subsidised rental housing\r\n\r\navailable to more people, we must be careful that  rental\r\n\r\nsubsidies are given to those who need them most.  Tenants\r\n\r\nwhose  financial  situations  have  improved  should   be\r\n\r\nencouraged  to  take  up a home ownership  flat  instead.\r\n\r\nThis  will  then free up more rental flats for the  truly\r\n\r\nneedy   and  will  also  prevent  tenants  from  becoming\r\n\r\nentrenched in subsidised rental housing. This is  a  real\r\n\r\nproblem.   If  you  go to Hong Kong, you  will  see  many\r\n\r\ntenants  who have lived in their subsidised rental  flats\r\n\r\nfor  many, many years, and inside their flats you can see\r\n\r\nplasma TVs, and we are told they own Mercedes Benzes, and\r\n\r\nso  on.   They  have simply got so used to rental  flats,\r\n\r\nbecause they are so cheap, and they just stay on and on.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to guard against this entrenchment problem.\r\n\r\nHDB  therefore intends to convert all existing  tenancies\r\n\r\nto  term tenancies and to implement income-based rentals.\r\n\r\nHDB will take into account the economic conditions before\r\n\r\ndeciding when to do so, and any adjustment will  be  done\r\n\r\nin  phases  to  allow people to gradually acclimatise  to\r\n\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Mortgage financing policies for low-income families</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the option of subsidised rental\r\n\r\nflats,  HDB has the Special Housing Assistance  Programme\r\n\r\n(SHAP)  to assist low-income families to buy their flats.\r\n\r\nToday,  households  with monthly incomes  of  $2,000  and\r\n\r\nbelow are exempted from credit assessment and are granted\r\n\r\nloans  of  up to 100% of the flat purchase price.   While\r\n\r\nthe  intention  is well-meaning, this  has  led  to  some\r\n\r\nlessees  buying flats beyond their means.  I  agree  with\r\n\r\nthe   sentiments   expressed   by   many   Members   that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  should  be  careful  and  not   over-extend\r\n\r\nthemselves  when buying property, whether HDB or  private\r\n\r\nhousing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, to encourage greater financial prudence,\r\n\r\nHDB  will extend credit assessment to this group of  flat\r\n\r\nbuyers  from 1st October 2003, just as it does today  for\r\n\r\nall other flat buyers.  HDB will also cap the quantum  of\r\n\r\nmortgage  loans according to the flat type purchased.   I\r\n\r\nhope that these prudential measures will ensure that low-income families buy flats when they are financially ready\r\n\r\nand  not  over-commit themselves.  I also want to  assure\r\n\r\nthat  HDB will continue to assist this group to own their\r\n\r\nflats  by  selling flats at subsidised prices and  before\r\n\r\nthey do so, to give them financial counselling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB will announce more details on the various policy\r\n\r\nchanges to be introduced later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>New flats will continue to be affordable</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to assure Members that the Government\r\n\r\nremains  committed to providing affordable public housing\r\n\r\nto Singaporeans, especially to first-timers.  HDB\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nflats are priced below their market values to enable many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to own a flat.  In fact, we peg  the  prices\r\n\r\nsuch  that 90% of Singaporeans can afford to own at least\r\n\r\na 3-room flat.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members, like Mr Iswaran and Mr Ang Mong Seng,\r\n\r\nhave  asked  many  times whether HDB  will  build  3-room\r\n\r\nflats,  either  as entry-level housing  or  to  meet  the\r\n\r\ndemand from downgraders.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, first-timers earning $2,000 or less can walk\r\n\r\nin  to  HDB  and buy a 3-room buy-back flat at subsidised\r\n\r\nprices.   They  can  literally, if they  are  not  fussy,\r\n\r\nactually  walk in and get their keys.   There  are  about\r\n\r\n150  units  of such 3-room flats offered for  sale  every\r\n\r\nmonth.   The demand is about 90 per month on the average.\r\n\r\nThere  are sufficient flats available for those who  wish\r\n\r\nto  buy a 3-room buy-back flat if they are earning  below\r\n\r\n$2,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For second-timers, those who are downgrading, they\r\n\r\ncan  buy  a 3-room flat from the open market.  There  are\r\n\r\nroughly  220,000  3-room  flats  available  in  the  open\r\n\r\nmarket.  I can assure the Members that there is currently\r\n\r\nno shortage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, HDB will monitor the trends closely and\r\n\r\nreview  the need to build new 3-room flats, if necessary.\r\n\r\nFor  a  start, we can consider building some 3-room flats\r\n\r\nin  our  SERS  (Selective En-bloc  Redevelopment  Scheme)\r\n\r\nreplacement precincts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for new 4-room flats, we will be offering such\r\n\r\nflats for sale.  There is a build-to-order (BTO) exercise\r\n\r\ncoming  up  this month.  These flats will be in  Punggol,\r\n\r\nSengkang   and  Sembawang,  and  they  will   be   priced\r\n\r\naffordably.  We have worked the numbers, we have done the\r\n\r\nsums  and,  roughly, households with an  average  monthly\r\n\r\nincome  will probably need to use about 20-22%  of  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  income  to  finance the purchase  of  these  new\r\n\r\nflats.  Again, just to remind Members, this is below  the\r\n\r\nrevised CPF OA contribution rate of 22%, and well  within\r\n\r\nthe   40%   guideline  which  HDB  and   most   financial\r\n\r\ninstitutions use as a basis for credit assessment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to private property owners.\r\n\r\nMany have expressed concerns about the impact of the  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges on their mortgage payments.  When we cut the  CPF\r\n\r\nby  10  percentage points in 1999, we implemented various\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  help  people to cope  with  these  changes.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  CPF members could use their Special Account  to\r\n\r\ntop  up any shortfall in the mortgage payments after they\r\n\r\nhave  made use of their OA balances.  And then those  who\r\n\r\nstill  had  a shortfall could apply for a bridging  loan.\r\n\r\nVery few people actually needed this extra help, but  the\r\n\r\nschemes  gave  comfort and reassurance  to  many.   These\r\n\r\nschemes will still be made available.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our experience in 1999, the mortgage\r\n\r\nrepayments should not be a major problem, as the  cut  is\r\n\r\nsmaller,   3   percentage   points   instead    of    10.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we will make sure that help is available to\r\n\r\neveryone who needs it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to read that private banks have\r\n\r\nexpressed  that  they will also exercise flexibility  and\r\n\r\nrestructure their mortgage loans to help borrowers  cope.\r\n\r\nSo,  these  schemes will further minimise difficulty  for\r\n\r\nborrowers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to measures to help\r\n\r\nthe construction industry.  The construction industry  is\r\n\r\ncurrently under a lot of stress.  It has borne the  brunt\r\n\r\nof the economic downturn.  Annual construction demand has\r\n\r\nfallen  from a peak of $24 billion in 1997 to $14 billion\r\n\r\nin  the  last two years.  We expect that demand is likely\r\n\r\nto  fall  further this year to about $11.5  billion.   As\r\n\r\ndemand  drops, competition becomes keener, more  intense.\r\n\r\nMany  contractors  are cash strapped.  Some  have  become\r\n\r\ninsolvent.  Sub-contractors are now complaining that they\r\n\r\ndo  not get paid or payments get delayed.  Several public\r\n\r\nprojects  have  been affected by work  stoppages  because\r\n\r\ncontractors run into financial difficulty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, about 60% of total annual demand in\r\n\r\nthe construction industry is from the public sector.  The\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister has announced that Government  will\r\n\r\nbring forward about\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n60 public sector projects worth more than $600 million in\r\n\r\nFY  2003  and  FY 2004.  This will help to boost  demand,\r\n\r\nsafeguard  jobs  and revive business  confidence  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our records show that 92% of public sector project\r\n\r\ncontracts valued between $10-$30 million were awarded  to\r\n\r\nlocal  contractors.   As  most  of  the  projects  to  be\r\n\r\nadvanced  will  be  less than $30 million  in  value,  we\r\n\r\nexpect  that  local  contractors will  stand  to  benefit\r\n\r\ndirectly  from this move, and it will help them  to  tide\r\n\r\nover this difficult period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also be fine-tuning some of the Government\r\n\r\nprocurement policies in order to help to further  improve\r\n\r\nthe situation for contractors.  In the last three months,\r\n\r\nthe  Building Construction Authority (BCA)  has  been  in\r\n\r\nserious  discussion with public agencies as well  as  the\r\n\r\nindustry  on how we can fine-tune the system in order  to\r\n\r\nhelp the contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we will tighten the Contractors'\r\n\r\nRegistry  System  (CRS) to better reflect  the  financial\r\n\r\nstanding  of  contractors  tendering  for  public  sector\r\n\r\nprojects.   What  we  try to achieve with  this  is  more\r\n\r\ntimely  financial health reporting which will then assist\r\n\r\npublic  sector  agencies to select  contractors  who  are\r\n\r\ncapable  of  undertaking projects within their  financial\r\n\r\ncapacity.   And,  hopefully,  this  will  minimise   work\r\n\r\nstoppages and also the downstream problems of payment  to\r\n\r\nsub-contractors and to suppliers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, BCA will relax the track record\r\n\r\nrequirements for construction firms to renew  and  retain\r\n\r\ntheir  CRS grades.  I remember that some Members in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  brought up the issue of suicide bids  and  we  had\r\n\r\nthis  very  lively  exchange as  to  whether  contractors\r\n\r\nactually  do go in for suicide bids.   Nevertheless,  the\r\n\r\npoint  is  that  in order to minimise the possibility  of\r\n\r\nthem  being pressured to make such suicide bids, BCA will\r\n\r\nextend  the  qualifying period from three years  to  five\r\n\r\nyears,  as well as include some ongoing projects,  rather\r\n\r\nthan  just  the completed projects.  Hopefully,  in  this\r\n\r\nway,  construction  firms will be able  to  secure  their\r\n\r\nplace in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRS  system, and not bid at any price just to secure jobs\r\n\r\nand to satisfy their track record.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures under consideration to improve the payment\r\n\r\nsystem  are also being considered.  In consultation  with\r\n\r\nGovernment and industry stakeholders, BCA will see how we\r\n\r\ncan  improve  the payment system right across  the  value\r\n\r\nchain, and the aim is to improve the cash flow which,  we\r\n\r\nall  know, is the life-line of the industry.  One measure\r\n\r\nbeing  studied  is  to  legislate a security  of  payment\r\n\r\nsystem,  and the intention is to provide a fast and  low-cost  system  of resolving progress payment  disputes  by\r\n\r\nadjudication.  This is a complicated matter.  It  is  not\r\n\r\nsomething  that  we will rush into.  We have  to  consult\r\n\r\nclosely  with  the  various parties in  the  industry  to\r\n\r\nensure that all relevant factors and views are taken into\r\n\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A multi-agency task force is also reviewing the\r\n\r\nPublic  Sector Standard Conditions of Contracts (PSSCOC).\r\n\r\nAnd  for  those  contractors who are involved  in  public\r\n\r\nsector projects, I think they will know exactly what this\r\n\r\nis  all about.  Under this contract, all payments to main\r\n\r\ncontractors   are  governed  by  certain  clauses.    The\r\n\r\nproposal is for payments to main contractors to  be  made\r\n\r\nknown to sub-contractors, so that main contractors cannot\r\n\r\nthen  say that they are not being paid in order to  avoid\r\n\r\nor  delay  paying the sub-contractors.  This is a  common\r\n\r\ncomplaint of sub-contractors.  We are seeing how  we  can\r\n\r\naddress this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also looking to speeding up the valuation of\r\n\r\nvariation  works  for faster progress  payments  and  for\r\n\r\nsettlement  of  final  accounts.  Again,  another  common\r\n\r\ncomplaint is that the Government agencies take  too  long\r\n\r\nto  settle  the  variation orders and therefore  progress\r\n\r\npayments  are  delayed.  So, we will see whether  we  can\r\n\r\nexpedite this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the current clause which provides for\r\n\r\nwithholding payments to contractors in order  to  recover\r\n\r\nliquidated damages and debts is also being\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreviewed.  In other words, we will see whether  we  still\r\n\r\nneed  to  consider a set-off clause whereby we hold  back\r\n\r\nsome  monies  that  are owing to the contractors  because\r\n\r\nthey  owe  the agencies some money.  This set-off  clause\r\n\r\ncurrently is causing some difficulties to contractors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will announce details of these measures in\r\n\r\nOctober.   But let me stress that while we can  take  all\r\n\r\npossible  measures to assist the viable industry  players\r\n\r\ncope  with the present difficulties, I must caution that,\r\n\r\nin  themselves,  they will not be sufficient.   Companies\r\n\r\nmust  continue to improve their skills, consolidate their\r\n\r\nresources  and upgrade their competitiveness.  Those  who\r\n\r\nare  ready  must seek opportunities overseas,  and  I  am\r\n\r\npleased that some of them are already doing so with  some\r\n\r\nsuccess.    Hopefully,  we  can  multiply  this   success\r\n\r\nfurther.   We will help our companies break into  markets\r\n\r\noverseas,  like  India and China.   And  as  our  economy\r\n\r\nrecovers, so will the construction industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me say, in conclusion, that the\r\n\r\nCPF  changes that the Government is making are  necessary\r\n\r\nto  save jobs in the immediate future.  And in the longer\r\n\r\nterm,  they  will  enable  our  businesses  to  be   more\r\n\r\ncompetitive and to position our economy for a  period  of\r\n\r\nrenewed  growth  when  the external  economic  conditions\r\n\r\nimprove.  The measures, which I have outlined, will  help\r\n\r\nSingaporeans and businesses, in particular, HDB residents\r\n\r\nand the construction industry, adapt to the changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, thank you for letting me join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek a\r\n\r\nclarification from the Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, earlier on, the Minister\r\n\r\nsaid  that  there are some 35,000 households who  do  not\r\n\r\nhave  enough funds either in the CPF Ordinary Account  or\r\n\r\nthe Special Account to service their mortgage loans after\r\n\r\nthe CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I know what is the profile of these 35,000 households\r\n\r\nand what is their room type?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I am afraid I do not have the\r\n\r\nprofile at this point in time.

Usually, the HDB allows for six months\r\n\r\nor  one year.  But if a resident, within one year, is not\r\n\r\nable  to  secure a job, can the HDB extend the  period  a\r\n\r\nsecond time or even a third time?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I think it was the Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister on Friday who said that \"HDB is forbearing to  a\r\n\r\nfault.\"   I think those were his exact words.  I am  sure\r\n\r\nthat  if  a case like that comes up and if the lessee  is\r\n\r\ngenuinely unable to service his mortgage loan,  HDB  will\r\n\r\nbend over backwards to see how it can help him.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, nobody likes to\r\n\r\ntake  bitter medicine.  But then if you have been to  one\r\n\r\ngreat and long party, a strong dose is probably what  you\r\n\r\nneed  to  sober up.  As far as I am concerned, the  party\r\n\r\nfor Singapore ended in 1998 when we first felt the impact\r\n\r\nof  the Asian financial crisis.  Years of strong economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  came  to an end, and that was the day  the  music\r\n\r\ndied.   Then, two years of economic growth - in 1999  and\r\n\r\n2000  -  masked  the  fact  that  fundamental  weaknesses\r\n\r\nremained unresolved, and that all was still not well and,\r\n\r\nfor  a while, many of us thought that the good times were\r\n\r\nback.  Many companies thought it was all right to go on a\r\n\r\nhiring  binge.   I read, for example, that  SPH  Holdings\r\n\r\nrecruited  as many as 1,000 new staff in the  year  2000,\r\n\r\nonly  to find that it had to inflict painful job cuts  in\r\n\r\nless  than  two years.  Likewise for Singapore  Airlines,\r\n\r\nwhose  handling of its retrenchment exercise  this  year,\r\n\r\nexemplifies how a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncompany ought not to handle industrial relations.   Sure,\r\n\r\nit  may  have  lost  $200 million in  April,  but  nobody\r\n\r\npointed  out that this was a company that also made  near\r\n\r\nto  $5  billion  in  the past five  years,  and,  in  all\r\n\r\nprobability, might still make money this year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no quarrel with a company getting rid of\r\n\r\nworkers  if it is going to be financially crippled,  only\r\n\r\nthat  in  the  modern  day  parlance  of  human  resource\r\n\r\nmanagers, they cleverly called it a \"pre-emptive lay-off\"\r\n\r\nor they now use the term \"rightsizing\".  They do not even\r\n\r\ncall   it  downsizing  because  rightsizing  allows   the\r\n\r\nemployer to lay off older and more expensive workers even\r\n\r\nwhen  they are still doing all right, and then hire  new,\r\n\r\nyounger, and obviously cheaper workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the bitter lessons workers have, therefore,\r\n\r\nlearned  in recent times is that loyalty to their company\r\n\r\nno  longer counts.  Even as we tell them that in this era\r\n\r\nof   globalisation,  no  job  is  guaranteed  for   life,\r\n\r\ncompanies then must also come to realise that the workers\r\n\r\nof  the  future  would no longer have the  same  kind  of\r\n\r\ncommitment, dedication and emotional attachment they used\r\n\r\nto have.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the bitter pill the Singapore worker has to\r\n\r\nswallow  is the cut in the CPF.  Two questions linger  in\r\n\r\nthis  debate: is the cut itself enough to save jobs, and,\r\n\r\nif  not,  then what?  Secondly, many Members have  asked,\r\n\r\nhow  about  doing  more  to make life  more  bearable  in\r\n\r\nSingapore?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first concern is understandable. We have\r\n\r\nseen   how  companies,  after  cutting  wages  and   even\r\n\r\ncompelling their workers to take no-pay leave, still  end\r\n\r\nup  firing  people.  So if we make this cut now,  can  we\r\n\r\nstill  save jobs, not to mention create new ones?   I  do\r\n\r\nnot  think  even the Government can give  us  a  definite\r\n\r\nanswer  on  this  one.  To be certain, no investor  comes\r\n\r\nhere  purely with the aim of giving us jobs.   They  come\r\n\r\nbecause  they believe that we can provide them  with  the\r\n\r\nmeans  to enable them to make profits, and only  then  do\r\n\r\nthey  give us the jobs.  So this cut in the CPF,  as  has\r\n\r\nbeen put up by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment,  is a signal of the Government's  recognition\r\n\r\nof  the  competitive environment that we are now  in  and\r\n\r\nthat  we are prepared to be flexible and nimble.  But  is\r\n\r\nthis  a  strong  enough  signal?   Many  businessmen   do\r\n\r\nappreciate  the savings that they would derive  but  they\r\n\r\nask,  why settle now for a range that will fluctuate with\r\n\r\nthe  economic cycle.  In fact, this would be no different\r\n\r\nfrom  what we had been doing in the past, where  the  CPF\r\n\r\nrate  was  adjusted along with the ups and downs  of  the\r\n\r\nbusiness  cycle, and what was missing was  the  certainty\r\n\r\nthat   businesses   needed  to   base   their   long-term\r\n\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another view to this question has also been\r\n\r\nraised by some economists.  The Government has said  that\r\n\r\nthe CPF cut would save employers $1.3 billion a year.   I\r\n\r\nread  that  some  economists have pointed  out  that  the\r\n\r\nbiggest  beneficiary of this cut will, in  fact,  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  This is because the Government and its  GLCs\r\n\r\nform  the single largest employer in Singapore, employing\r\n\r\nwhat  they  estimate  to be 40% of our  workforce.   This\r\n\r\nmeans  that  the  Government is,  in  fact,  saving  $520\r\n\r\nmillion.   With  the  increase  in  GST  next  year,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will rake in - it has been estimated, I do not\r\n\r\nknow how correct it is - another $400 million.  So if you\r\n\r\nadd  this  $400 million to the $520 million,  you  get  a\r\n\r\ntotal  of  $920 million that will actually be transferred\r\n\r\nout of the system back to the Government, and that leaves\r\n\r\nmany  of  the  economists to express the  concern  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  what  is  left in the private  sector  would  be\r\n\r\nmeaningful  enough to create the new jobs that  we  badly\r\n\r\nwant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if past cuts in the CPF rate have still\r\n\r\nnot solved our dilemma, then it must beg the question  of\r\n\r\nwhat else.  Like many other Members, I too share the view\r\n\r\nthat  Government  can do much more to bring  down  costs.\r\n\r\nSometimes,  I  believe that the problem with  this  whole\r\n\r\nissue  of  Government costs may lie in the way Government\r\n\r\ndoes  its  costings.  How else can you  explain  why  the\r\n\r\nGovernment charges 2% of the value of a car when you want\r\n\r\nto transfer ownership?  And this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvalue  of your car is not its market value, not the price\r\n\r\nyou  sell and someone buys it, but a value determined  by\r\n\r\nthe LTA, which then, of course, turns out to be much more\r\n\r\nand,  as a result, if you buy a second-hand car, you  end\r\n\r\nup  paying  hundreds, and sometimes  even  thousands,  of\r\n\r\ndollars  to the Government just to register  it.   Now  I\r\n\r\nbring  this up because many SMEs buy second-hand vehicles\r\n\r\nfor  their operations as they cannot afford new ones, but\r\n\r\nthey  do  not know why they have to pay so much  just  to\r\n\r\nhave  someone  at  the LTA press a  few  buttons  on  the\r\n\r\ncomputer and register them as the new owner.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, last year, during the debate on the Medical\r\n\r\nRegistration  (Amendment) Bill, the House heard  that  it\r\n\r\ncosts between $170,000 and $250,000 to train a doctor  in\r\n\r\na  university in Sydney, Oxford or Cambridge - I think it\r\n\r\nwas  Dr Lily Neo who pointed this out - but educating one\r\n\r\nmedical student at our own NUS costs about $400,000.  Now\r\n\r\nthis again begs the question of how Government arrives at\r\n\r\nsuch a cost, and how do we end up being double that of  a\r\n\r\nworld class institution like Oxford?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what about the point of making life more\r\n\r\nbearable  in  Singapore?  Many of us do  appreciate  that\r\n\r\nGovernment  has done a lot to lower various  charges  and\r\n\r\ngiven us rebates and Economic Restructuring Shares.   But\r\n\r\njudging  from what I have heard in the past few days,  it\r\n\r\nseems  we  have not done enough.  To make deep cuts  that\r\n\r\nwill make a meaningful difference to costs will mean  re-examining  the philosophies behind some of our  policies.\r\n\r\nSir,  many  of  our policies were formulated  to  achieve\r\n\r\ncertain social needs and while some may have succeeded in\r\n\r\nachieving the social needs, they have also turned out  to\r\n\r\nbe valuable cash cows for the Government.  But if it is a\r\n\r\ncash  cow  for the Government, it translates to a  burden\r\n\r\nfor the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take for example the foreign maid levy which was\r\n\r\nintroduced  to moderate our reliance on foreign  domestic\r\n\r\nworkers.  But each increase in the levy has added to  the\r\n\r\nburden of many tens of thousands of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhouseholds - and we still have not been able to curb  the\r\n\r\nrising demand.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example - transportation policies. They\r\n\r\nhave  always  been controversial ones.   We  took  fiscal\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  prevent our tiny island from being  clogged\r\n\r\nwith vehicles enmeshed in gridlock.  But, in the process,\r\n\r\nwe  gained the dubious honour of being the most expensive\r\n\r\nplace  in  the  world to own and drive  a  car.   In  our\r\n\r\ndesire, Sir, to have a world-class transportation system,\r\n\r\nwe  may  have  overlooked  the fact  that  all  that  the\r\n\r\nSingaporean wanted was a system that could get  him  from\r\n\r\npoint  A to point B, without any of the frills that  have\r\n\r\nactually resulted in higher fares.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, quite often it is this pre-occupation with\r\n\r\nwanting  to be world-class in many things that  sometimes\r\n\r\nhas  me  worried.   Sure, we do not want  to  be  in  the\r\n\r\nbackwaters of nations but we also do not want to  end  up\r\n\r\nwith  a  world-class cost of living, as a writer  to  the\r\n\r\nForum  page  said  last week, that is comparable  to  New\r\n\r\nYork, Stockholm or Frankfurt.  He was quoting from a cost\r\n\r\nof   living  index  survey  conducted  by  The  Economist\r\n\r\nIntelligence Unit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone - I cannot remember who, but someone in this\r\n\r\nHouse  -  said that if you want the quality of a  Jaguar,\r\n\r\nthen  do not expect to pay Toyota prices.  Well, I  think\r\n\r\nunder  the  present day circumstances, Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nnot  mind being a bit more humble, and if we really  want\r\n\r\nto  be  nimble and travel light, perhaps a ride  on  that\r\n\r\nnifty  little Toyota will do just as well.  Maybe  it  is\r\n\r\nnot  so  classy, but if it does the same job, I think  we\r\n\r\ncan be quite happy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us - Government and people - have to have\r\n\r\nless  expectations of one another.  But were we  all,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  everyone  of us here, not responsible  for  asking\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  to pursue the ownership of properties  like\r\n\r\nthere  was  no tomorrow?  3-room flat not enough?   Well,\r\n\r\nupgrade to 4- or 5-room.  HDB flat not good enough?   Buy\r\n\r\nprivate property.  One home not enough?  Well, buy  2  or\r\n\r\nmore, if you can\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nafford  it.   And now we are even asking the Minister  to\r\n\r\nrelease more flats for rental!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is going to be a rough ride ahead, but I\r\n\r\nthink the people will accept the cuts even if it is  with\r\n\r\nreluctance.  They are prepared to take this journey  with\r\n\r\nthe  Government,  out  of  the valley  of  gloom  to  the\r\n\r\npromised sunny highland.  Nobody likes to have his  wages\r\n\r\ncut,  particularly  when  we  cannot  even  promise   any\r\n\r\nrestoration.   So, I must say that while the announcement\r\n\r\nthat   a   further  cut  in  salaries  of  the  political\r\n\r\nleadership and of top civil servants recently  does  show\r\n\r\nthat  we are prepared to lead the way, perhaps we  should\r\n\r\nnot  be  too hasty to say that this cut is only  for  one\r\n\r\nyear.  Why only for one year?  Why not just leave the cut\r\n\r\nalone?  I think at a time when we are asking everyone  to\r\n\r\ntighten his belt, we should not be too fast in talking of\r\n\r\nrestoring  our own pay until we really reach  that  sunny\r\n\r\nhighland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that when the chips are down, the\r\n\r\nSingaporean  is  willing to face up to the  difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe  party may be over, but we have not switched off  the\r\n\r\nlights  in  Singapore yet, and someday, I hope,  not  too\r\n\r\nlong, the music will start to play again.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\ndo  not  want to lament the past, like my good friend  Mr\r\n\r\nTan Soo Khoon.  I want to see the future.  I want to make\r\n\r\nsure that Singapore succeeds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey by the Feedback Unit, 70% of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans have accepted the need for the CPF cut.  Now\r\n\r\nthis  figure  of  70% was before DPM announced  the  help\r\n\r\npackage.  So the figure could have been higher.  And I do\r\n\r\nnot  intend  to bore this House with the reasons  why  we\r\n\r\nneed to cut CPF any further.  PM, DPM and Members of this\r\n\r\nHouse have given reasons why this cut is necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This debate is about the livelihood of Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntoday   and  the  future.   It  is  about  labour  market\r\n\r\nflexibility.  Are we prepared to change to meet  the  new\r\n\r\nchallenges of doing businesses in the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworld?   It  is also about capability and cost.   Are  we\r\n\r\ncompetitive?   But above all, this debate is  about  jobs\r\n\r\nand  job  creation.  To the Singaporeans watching  us  on\r\n\r\ntelevision  every evening, what they are looking  for  is\r\n\r\nwhether  we  are able to provide them with jobs,  and  if\r\n\r\nthey  have got no jobs, they want to know what help lines\r\n\r\nare  we  giving them.  And this is where I will  approach\r\n\r\nthis  whole  issue.  These are very serious  thoughts  in\r\n\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is very familiar with the movement of\r\n\r\nwhite-collar  jobs, from the US to India,  especially  in\r\n\r\nthe   area   of  IT  outsourcing  and  business   process\r\n\r\noutsourcing.  These are very modern terms but  these  are\r\n\r\nvery, very important terms for the business world.  Other\r\n\r\ncountries are having a slice of this business because  of\r\n\r\nthis  outsourcing.  And, therefore, we see countries like\r\n\r\nthe Philippines and India having a slice of this business\r\n\r\ncake.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you, in the Philippines, Proctor &\r\n\r\nGamble has already processed its payroll, travel, invoice\r\n\r\nprocessing and other work at offices in Manila.  While it\r\n\r\nwould  be  best if such works have been assigned  to  the\r\n\r\nSingapore office, like what Citigroup is doing with their\r\n\r\ncash, securities, and credit cards, Singaporeans may have\r\n\r\nto  go  and  work  in offices away from home.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  our share of the service business pie is  getting\r\n\r\nsmaller,  and  moreover competition from China  has  also\r\n\r\naffected  our  manufacturing side.  Now what  do  we  do?\r\n\r\nSurely we must do something to prevent this loss of jobs.\r\n\r\nWe  have  never  sat  idly by.  We  have  faced  problems\r\n\r\nbefore,  and only recently we fought SARS extremely  well\r\n\r\nand  gained  worldwide recognition  for  our  efforts  to\r\n\r\ncontain  SARS.  This debate would send clear  signals  to\r\n\r\ninvestors  that  the  Singapore Government  is  seriously\r\n\r\nurging its people to stand up and face the new realities.\r\n\r\nThe  Government has got practically everybody involved  - grassroots  organisations, unions, employers, politicians\r\n\r\nlike  us,  all together.  And judging from the  feedback,\r\n\r\nthis wave of change in mindset, in attitudes, and even in\r\n\r\nour ego, is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeginning  to sink into the population.  And  this  would\r\n\r\nbear  well for our country.  The pain that many will face\r\n\r\nis  cushioned by the help package that DPM announced last\r\n\r\nFriday.   It may not please all.  But it must be  managed\r\n\r\nwell   at   the  ground  level,  by  our  own  grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations  and  by our CDCs.  So everyone  who  needs\r\n\r\nhelp will be helped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans want to know where the jobs are\r\n\r\ncreated.  So looking at the help package of $1 billion, a\r\n\r\nsubstantial sum of $600 million comes from some 60 public\r\n\r\nsector  infrastructure projects.  These are mostly  small\r\n\r\nprojects,  like  development and  improvement  works  for\r\n\r\nroads,  schools, community clubs.  These would definitely\r\n\r\nbenefit  the local contractors.  But will the  jobs  find\r\n\r\nSingaporean takers?  I hope so, especially in  these  bad\r\n\r\ntimes.   We will have to wait and see because this sector\r\n\r\nof  the  economy  has  been primarily  taken  by  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relaxing of the subletting rules will help some\r\n\r\nfamilies,  as  this will provide some older  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nanother   source  of  income.   The  $40   million   Work\r\n\r\nAssistance  Programme will help and encourage low  income\r\n\r\nunemployed Singaporeans back to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tourism forms an important source of revenue for our\r\n\r\ncountry.   And  tourists bring a lot of  income  for  the\r\n\r\nretail  sector,  the hotels and the tour agencies.   This\r\n\r\nsector  suffered tremendous loss during the SARS  period.\r\n\r\nI  was  part  of the \"Cool\" team that tried to  help  the\r\n\r\ntourism industry.  I can tell you my first meeting at the\r\n\r\n\"Cool\" team was so depressing.  The hotels were reporting\r\n\r\n10%-20%  occupancy  rate.  The retail  sector  was  down.\r\n\r\nTourist companies, tour agencies, were closing down.   So\r\n\r\nI  think  the present $100 million Tourism Fund that  has\r\n\r\nbeen allocated to them will definitely help the industry,\r\n\r\nat  least  to bring back the tourists and the  jobs  that\r\n\r\nhave been lost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no choice. If we cannot find jobs in\r\n\r\nSingapore, we must go out to find them.  With  our  brand\r\n\r\nname \"Singapore\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  an  internationally  recognised  disciplined  labour\r\n\r\nforce, we have to chase for the dollar outside Singapore.\r\n\r\nSo  an understanding of world business practices by young\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  is  very important.  Being educated,  young\r\n\r\nand mobile is helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MNCs now work differently. They are outsourcing\r\n\r\nIT, and world business practices have changed a lot.  And\r\n\r\nthis  would  require a lot of mindset  change  among  our\r\n\r\nyoung  Singaporeans  to understand how  they  work.   Big\r\n\r\ncompanies,  as  you  know,  are  outsourcing  to   India,\r\n\r\nThailand and the Philippines.  And even our local  banks,\r\n\r\nlike  DBS,  also  do  a  lot  of  outsourcing.   So  this\r\n\r\nInternational  Enterprise  Incentive  scheme,  which  was\r\n\r\nproposed  last  Friday  by DPM, will  go  to  help  local\r\n\r\ncompanies  build the capabilities to venture  abroad  and\r\n\r\nthus provide more jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I read very carefully one interview\r\n\r\nthat  was  given,  and  there was  an  exchange  actually\r\n\r\nbetween  our Minister Lim Swee Say and the IBM boss.   It\r\n\r\nappeared  in  the  Straits Times and, in  that  page,  it\r\n\r\nincluded  a column on the warning by IBM.  There  were  a\r\n\r\nfew tell-tale words that kept cropping up and I know they\r\n\r\nwere meaningfully and carefully crafted words.  The first\r\n\r\nword is \"reconstruct\", meaning simply change.  The second\r\n\r\nis  \"deconstruct\", meaning remove the old ways  of  doing\r\n\r\nbusiness.   And  the third is \"re-deploying\"  the  supply\r\n\r\nchain.    But  two words captured my attention  and  also\r\n\r\ncaptured the headlines of the Business Times - capability\r\n\r\nand costs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis given to costs, especially in this\r\n\r\neconomic   climate,  is  very  telling.   This  interview\r\n\r\nencapsulated the essence of how and what the MNC business\r\n\r\nstrategy  would  be like and young Singaporeans  entering\r\n\r\nthe job market must fully understand this and be prepared\r\n\r\nto do overseas assignment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have faith and confidence in the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The way we handled SARS was admired by many.\r\n\r\nIt  revealed a disciplined people with a strong  will  to\r\n\r\novercome the odds.  But we\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  in  a better position today than in 1965.  This  was\r\n\r\npointed  out to us by the Senior Minister.  This time  we\r\n\r\nhave  assets  in the form of our reserves.  The  reserves\r\n\r\nreveal   our  high  standing  internationally  and   that\r\n\r\ncapability to tide over, if the worst happens.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, two, our FTAs. The FTAs would generate and\r\n\r\nguarantee  us  tax-  free access to  the  United  States,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and  those countries who have  FTAs  with  us.\r\n\r\nMany  countries, in the earlier times, criticised us  for\r\n\r\nall  these FTAs.  But I think they realise the importance\r\n\r\nof  the FTAs and we must make full use of the FTAs.  They\r\n\r\nare  already beginning to negotiate for FTAs, but we have\r\n\r\na headstart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Singapore companies, especially our SMEs, must\r\n\r\ntake  advantage  and leverage on the FTAs  to  help  them\r\n\r\nbetter understand this very important premium.  We should\r\n\r\norganise  seminars  and  even set  up  a  special  bureau\r\n\r\naccessible to our SMEs and local companies to exploit our\r\n\r\nFTAs to enhance our business and to create jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one area which I share\r\n\r\nconcern   with  Minister  Cedric  Foo.   He  spoke   this\r\n\r\nafternoon about productivity, and I fully agree with him.\r\n\r\nI  think our productivity has got to be looked at  again.\r\n\r\nMinister  Lim Boon Heng's chart on productivity  revealed\r\n\r\nthat  we  are  not  that productive,  especially  in  our\r\n\r\nservices side.  Two things that MNCs are looking for,  as\r\n\r\nI  said earlier, are capability and cost.  How capable is\r\n\r\nour  workforce?  I know we have a disciplined  workforce,\r\n\r\nas  I  said, but this is not enough.  We must  have  high\r\n\r\nproductive  workers,  or what is so different  between  a\r\n\r\nChinese worker, a Malaysian worker, or a Thai worker.  We\r\n\r\nmust  have  that  premium.  Our workers  must  be  really\r\n\r\nproductive  because we cannot compete with their  workers\r\n\r\non cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Productivity in services, as shown by Mr Lim Boon\r\n\r\nHeng  in  his  chart given to the House, is significantly\r\n\r\nlower  than in many countries with a population  of  less\r\n\r\nthan  20  million.  We are ranked 20th.  I  remember  the\r\n\r\nstrong emphasis by Senior\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee  Kuan  Yew many years ago  in  one  of  his\r\n\r\nNational  Day  speeches.   It  was,  I  would  recall,  a\r\n\r\nlandmark speech.  Because he emphasised the importance of\r\n\r\nproductivity  for Singapore's future.  I  think  we  must\r\n\r\nrevisit  that speech because it lays out the reasons  why\r\n\r\nwe  must  have a very productive workforce  to  meet  the\r\n\r\nchallenges.  That was many, many years ago and yet to see\r\n\r\nthe  chart  that  we are ranked No. 20,  I  think,  is  a\r\n\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that we have not done enough about\r\n\r\nproductivity.   Minister Cedric Foo had highlighted  what\r\n\r\nSPRING has done and all the productive work that they had\r\n\r\nput into getting Singaporeans to be more productive in so\r\n\r\nmany sectors.  But I still think much could be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example that we are all very\r\n\r\nfamiliar  with.  Look at our construction  site.   It  is\r\n\r\nalways  messy,  noisy  and  housekeeping  is  poor,  with\r\n\r\nmaterials  thrown all over the places.  I  was  having  a\r\n\r\nholiday  in  Perth, Australia, and I  was  staying  in  a\r\n\r\nrelative's house.  The first day, I noticed a vacant plot\r\n\r\nof land adjacent to this house.  The second day, three or\r\n\r\nfour  workers came and started working on it,  and  there\r\n\r\nwere only three to four workers.  But by the seventh day,\r\n\r\nI  could  see that at least the bottom half of the  house\r\n\r\nwas  already constructed.  No noise, yes, I could  hardly\r\n\r\nhear any noise.  The materials were well-stacked and  put\r\n\r\nneatly  away.   Of  course, they used  a  great  deal  of\r\n\r\nprefabricated items, and there was hardly any mess.   The\r\n\r\nfew  workers seemed to know exactly what to do and no one\r\n\r\nseemed to get into each other's way.  Later, I discovered\r\n\r\nthat  each  of  the  workers is actually  a  professional\r\n\r\nbuilder and he reads the house plan.  I think if you  are\r\n\r\nable  to read the house plan, you will not get into  each\r\n\r\nother's   way  because  you  know  what  to   do.    But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, for our workers, I do not think they  even\r\n\r\nknow  how to read the plans.  And that is why we get such\r\n\r\nshoddy work in our homes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if Singaporeans want the jobs back in the\r\n\r\nconstruction industry, they must be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2904</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  productive for the construction company's  boss  to\r\n\r\nhire  them.   They  are  no  match  against  the  foreign\r\n\r\nworkers,  in terms of pay.  They must be more  than  just\r\n\r\nsimple workers.  They must work smart.  They must be able\r\n\r\nto read the house plan.  They must be multi-tasked people\r\n\r\nand can be paid higher for their job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was renovating my house, it took the local\r\n\r\ncontractor  four times to fix my wash basin.   I  thought\r\n\r\nhis  workers were all foreign workers.  But when I  heard\r\n\r\nthat  they  were  all  Singaporeans,  I  was  very,  very\r\n\r\ndisappointed.   They are not even Malaysians.   They  are\r\n\r\nall  Singaporeans.  After the second time,  I  asked  his\r\n\r\nworker  whether he was proud of the job.  His reply  was,\r\n\r\n\"Every  one also does like that.\"  But I said, \"I am  not\r\n\r\nevery  one.   You do it again.\"  And I told them,  \"Don't\r\n\r\nblame  the Government if we approve more foreign  workers\r\n\r\nbecause  you  are only as good, but more expensive.   And\r\n\r\nthat  is  not enough.\"  After the fourth attempt,  I  was\r\n\r\nsatisfied. So I asked them what they thought of the final\r\n\r\nresult.   They  liked it.  They agreed they  should  have\r\n\r\ndone it at the first attempt, if they took the trouble to\r\n\r\nread  and  understand the instructions, and  not  assumed\r\n\r\nthat they knew how to fix a wash basin, because some wash\r\n\r\nbasins can be a little different.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is so much time was\r\n\r\nwasted  and productivity was zero.  Similarly,  you  walk\r\n\r\ninto a restaurant and you try to get information from the\r\n\r\nmenu.  The waiter will be probably walking three to  four\r\n\r\ntimes  to  the Captain about the items you have asked  or\r\n\r\nenquired.   This  is bad, unproductive service.   Can  we\r\n\r\nblame  the  waiter?  I think the manager is  also  to  be\r\n\r\nblamed.   Singaporeans shun such  jobs.   But  if  proper\r\n\r\nupgrading  is  done  in  this  services  industry,   more\r\n\r\nSingaporeans will work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? DPM Lee again has announced the Domestic\r\n\r\nSector Productivity Fund last Friday.  We have got to use\r\n\r\nthis  fund  to develop systems, guidelines and workflows,\r\n\r\nbecause  no one, no matter how good he is, if we  have  a\r\n\r\nlousy system, he can never perform.  So, productivity is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2905</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nlinked  with  the way we do things, the way  the  company\r\n\r\nplans  the  job work.  We have to empower that individual\r\n\r\nwith  knowledge to be able to be productive.  So, let  us\r\n\r\nget  this  fund  to  improve the image  of  our  services\r\n\r\nsector,  so  that  the jobs now taken by foreign  workers\r\n\r\nwill eventually go back to Singaporeans.  Of course, this\r\n\r\nis  only one sector I have highlighted.  I am sure  there\r\n\r\nare  many, many sectors which were also highlighted  just\r\n\r\nnow  by the Minister of State for Defence, Mr Cedric Foo,\r\n\r\nand we should all look into them in more detail.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, this time round, the\r\n\r\nexpectations of many Singaporeans have been dented.  Egos\r\n\r\nhave been hurt, but there is no shame in enjoying a lower\r\n\r\ncost  of  living,  a lower level job  with  a  less  than\r\n\r\nexpected salary, a different lifestyle.  But all  is  not\r\n\r\nlost.  We will bounce back.  We must use this rough patch\r\n\r\nin  our  economy to consolidate our position,  internally\r\n\r\nand  externally, so that we can weather the  future  with\r\n\r\neven  more  confidence.   We  have  done  it  with  SARS.\r\n\r\nSurely, the team that fought SARS well will also bring us\r\n\r\nout  of this jam.  We must have confidence in them.   But\r\n\r\nwe must also have confidence in ourselves, so that we can\r\n\r\ntry  to put everything into shape and move on.  I believe\r\n\r\nthis team can make it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nretuning of the CPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central) (In Mandarin): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   ever   since   the   Prime   Minister's\r\n\r\nannouncement of an impending CPF cut in his National  Day\r\n\r\nRally speech, the NTUC has spared no time in meeting with\r\n\r\nits affiliated unions to discuss this problem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union leaders are very rational and they are\r\n\r\nbold  enough to face the facts.  They have agreed to  the\r\n\r\ncut  in  the  employer's CPF contribution rate  to  lower\r\n\r\nbusiness   cost,   so  that  workers'   jobs   could   be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded.  It is hoped that the savings as a result of\r\n\r\nthe   CPF  cuts  could  be  used  to  augment  production\r\n\r\nfacilities to expand their business and to safeguard\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2906</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  jobs  of the workers, and even to create  new  jobs.\r\n\r\nThey  also  appeal to the employers to have a conscience,\r\n\r\nand  not to put all the savings in their pockets and have\r\n\r\na  fling  in life.  They should share these savings  with\r\n\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade union leaders are worried about members not\r\n\r\nbeing  able  to cope with mortgage payments,  healthcare,\r\n\r\ntransport,  utilities and conservancy charges,  and  they\r\n\r\nhope  that the Government can empathise with their plight\r\n\r\nand  lend them a helping hand.  The $1 billion assistance\r\n\r\npackage  has  brought  a sigh of relief  to  the  workers\r\n\r\nalthough  these measures cannot satisfy everybody.   This\r\n\r\nis  understandable.  Why do I say this?  In my  chit-chat\r\n\r\nwith  the  constituents in the coffee shops,  they  would\r\n\r\ninvariably  tell me, \"Heh, do not be too  depressed.   In\r\n\r\nthis  age, it is difficult to be a God.  It is even  more\r\n\r\ndifficult to be the Government.\"  They also said that, if\r\n\r\nit  rains  every day, housewives will grumble that  their\r\n\r\nclothes will not get dried.  If it does not rain, workers\r\n\r\nwho  are  working under the hot sun, find that the  wages\r\n\r\nthey  earn  are  not enough to buy the drinks  needed  to\r\n\r\nquench  their  thirst.  Clerical staff who  work  in  the\r\n\r\noffice  complain that the air-conditioner is blowing  hot\r\n\r\nair  and  not  cool  air.   It is  not  easy  to  be  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  No matter what the Government has done,  the\r\n\r\npeople  will find some fault with it.  I asked them  what\r\n\r\nthey thought of the assistance package.  They said, \"Very\r\n\r\ngood, what more can we ask for?  Unless someone can bless\r\n\r\nme with a winning number so that I can strike the 4-digit\r\n\r\nlottery.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an old friend, a transport union\r\n\r\nofficial in Taiwan, told me over the phone: \"Mr Ong, your\r\n\r\nworkers  are wonderful.  They are very adaptable, whether\r\n\r\nin  good fortune or adversity.  They are even prepared to\r\n\r\nsuffer  wage  cuts  and  CPF  cuts.  Your  Government  is\r\n\r\nremarkable - so much subsidies (assistance measures)!\"  I\r\n\r\nasked him how was the situation over in Taiwan.  He said,\r\n\r\n\"Over  here, who cares?  The government is busy with  the\r\n\r\npresidential elections next year.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not easy to be a good\r\n\r\ngovernment, because the better the government, the higher\r\n\r\nwould  be the expectations of the people, and more people\r\n\r\nwill  complain.  A bad government finds it easy to run  a\r\n\r\ncountry  because the people would have got  used  to  it.\r\n\r\nWhat can you ask for?  Consider yourself lucky if you  do\r\n\r\nnot starve to death.  If you ask him why he does not look\r\n\r\nfor  a job and earn a living for himself, he would reply,\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it is so easy to find a job?  You must have\r\n\r\nmoney to get a job.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singaporeans are very fortunate. If\r\n\r\nthey work, they can get money.  There is no need for them\r\n\r\nto  use money to buy jobs.  The Government has worked out\r\n\r\na  Work  Assistance  Programme  to  help  the  retrenched\r\n\r\nworkers and to help them find new jobs.  Older people  do\r\n\r\nnot  have to worry, because the Government has set  up  a\r\n\r\n\"job  matching and training scheme\" for them.  As a trade\r\n\r\nunion leader, I am proud to have a Government that is  so\r\n\r\nconcerned about the welfare of the workers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Lee also stressed the need to cut waste in the\r\n\r\nGovernment.  The Acting Minister for Health has also said\r\n\r\nthat  hospital charges will not be raised.  However,  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Sports  Council (SSC)  has  decided  to  raise\r\n\r\nadmission  charges to public swimming pools. With  effect\r\n\r\nfrom  October 2003, charges for those under 18  years  of\r\n\r\nage  will be raised from $0.50 to $0.80 and by July  next\r\n\r\nyear,  they  will  be further raised to  $1.10.   As  for\r\n\r\nadults, the present fee of $1.00 would be raised to $1.50\r\n\r\nwith  effect  from October 2003, and then to  $2.00  from\r\n\r\nJuly  2004. For senior citizens, the admission fees  will\r\n\r\nbe  raised  from  $0.50 to $1.00.  During  weekends,  the\r\n\r\n$0.70  for under-18 will be raised to $1.10 and  by  July\r\n\r\n2004, to $1.50.  Adult fees will be raised from $1.30  to\r\n\r\n$2.00, and then to $2.70. As for the senior citizens, the\r\n\r\nfees will rise from $0.60 to $1.10, and then to $1.50.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, those who live in condominiums are\r\n\r\nalready having swimming pools at their door-steps.  Those\r\n\r\nwho are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2908</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwell-off  can  go to their clubs to swim.  The  Singapore\r\n\r\nSports  Council  has  more than  20  swimming  complexes,\r\n\r\nspread  over the various housing estates. These  are  for\r\n\r\nthe  middle and lower income groups to use.  At  present,\r\n\r\nif  a  grandfather  takes his two  grandchildren  to  the\r\n\r\nswimming  pool on a week-day, he pays $1.50.  By October,\r\n\r\nhe  has  to pay $2.40, an increase of $0.90.  During  the\r\n\r\nweekends, he will have to pay $1.30 more.  Those who live\r\n\r\nin  the  vicinity of the swimming pools told me that  the\r\n\r\nswimming  pools are idle during weekdays.   According  to\r\n\r\nSSC,  the increase in fees is aimed at balancing the cost\r\n\r\nand  revenue.   What I worry is that when  the  fees  are\r\n\r\nincreased, the swimming pools will be idle and they  will\r\n\r\nbecome breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To balance cost and revenue, I have a novel idea.\r\n\r\nThere  are  two swimming pools in each complex.   We  can\r\n\r\nrent  out  one pool to Qianhu Fish Farm, a tropical  fish\r\n\r\ncompany,  to  breed  their fish.   Therefore,  with  this\r\n\r\nrental  income, there is no need to raise  the  admission\r\n\r\nfees.   Is this not good for the people?  While swimming,\r\n\r\nwe  can  also  watch  the tropical  fish!   Is  this  not\r\n\r\nwonderful?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, while the people are supporting the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  reform programme, what  has  the  SSC  been\r\n\r\ndoing?  Reforming the CPF is a painful decision.   It  is\r\n\r\nalso  painful  to  the  people.  However,  what  is  most\r\n\r\nimportant  is that we should change our mindset  to  face\r\n\r\nreality, to be pragmatic and to face life honestly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote from my bus captain. The bus captain\r\n\r\ntold me that we were lucky that we had the CPF to be cut.\r\n\r\nIf we do not have any CPF to cut, then it would be pretty\r\n\r\nbad  for us, because it would mean that we do not have  a\r\n\r\njob.   Therefore,  we  should face the  CPF  cut  calmly.\r\n\r\nThough poor, we should be contented and happy.  When  one\r\n\r\nis  wealthy,  one should be compassionate towards  others\r\n\r\nwho   are   less   fortunate.   If  the   Government   is\r\n\r\ncompassionate, and we are united, our future  is  bright,\r\n\r\nand Singapore will be a place where people would like  to\r\n\r\nlive  and  work in.  When winter comes to an end,  spring\r\n\r\nwill be around.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2909</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

They  were\r\n\r\nmindful  of the pervasive and painful effects that  would\r\n\r\nresult.  Varied scenarios and computations were examined.\r\n\r\nStaff  pored  through reams of printed data  and  tables.\r\n\r\nThey   tried  their  best  to  minimise  the   pain   and\r\n\r\nrecommended spacing out or phasing in changes while still\r\n\r\nachieving  our political, economic and social objectives.\r\n\r\nMs  Indranee  Rajah will be pleased to know  that  common\r\n\r\nsense   indeed  was  used  in  plentiful  dollops.    The\r\n\r\nreactions from Members and Singaporeans have reassured me\r\n\r\nthat they have succeeded in some measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as many Members in this House who rose to speak\r\n\r\non  these CPF changes have realised and expressed, larger\r\n\r\nand  more  fundamental issues underlie these CPF changes.\r\n\r\nFor  while  the reasons for and pace of CPF changes  have\r\n\r\nbeen  accepted  by  the  majority,  this  moment  at  the\r\n\r\ncrossroads  has  occasioned all  Singaporeans  to  wonder\r\n\r\nabout our future, our needs and our fates.  There is even\r\n\r\nfear  among some Singaporeans.  They are asking if  these\r\n\r\nchanges  signal  an  end  to  the  Singaporean  dream;  a\r\n\r\nrelegation  from our first world status; an end  to  some\r\n\r\naspirations and hopes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address these concerns as well as\r\n\r\nspecific queries from Members\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2910</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  Parliament.  To me, there is the greater significance\r\n\r\nof  character and nation-building in this exercise.   Our\r\n\r\nresponses to these changes should be seen in this context\r\n\r\nas  it signals a people's - a nation's - resolve, to want\r\n\r\nto chart and better their destiny.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who believe these measures would not\r\n\r\nwork.   They say cutting CPF will dampen the recovery  as\r\n\r\nconsumer  expenditure  falls  and  the  property   market\r\n\r\nsoftens  due to reduced purchasing power.  A deflationary\r\n\r\ncycle will follow.  Other similar pessimists say that  it\r\n\r\nis  too little - it would not make a difference.  We  are\r\n\r\nso  uncompetitive  that whatever we  do,  companies  will\r\n\r\ncontinue  to pull out or bypass Singapore.  The avalanche\r\n\r\nof cheaper manpower has overtaken us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need not be despondent or insecure or\r\n\r\nbelieve  these  futilitarians.  Mr Tan Soo  Khoon  quoted\r\n\r\nsome  reports about these measures.  I did not  read  the\r\n\r\nreports  but  it occurred to me, while he  was  speaking,\r\n\r\nthat they are conjectured that this was a convoluted  way\r\n\r\nfor  the  Government to make money.  They  give  us  more\r\n\r\ncredit  than what it is due.  He said, and he can correct\r\n\r\nme  if  I  misheard  him, that the CPF  cuts  would  save\r\n\r\nGovernment and GLCs $500 million, that the GST would give\r\n\r\nGovernment $400 million.  I am not sure why, if  you  are\r\n\r\nthe  major employer, you save $500 million; when the  GST\r\n\r\nincreases, you also make money.  Perhaps someone else can\r\n\r\nexplain   the  mathematics  to  me.   On  top  of   that,\r\n\r\nGovernment  now  gives  a  $1  billion  package  to  help\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  end up with a budget deficit.   If  indeed\r\n\r\nthis is a convoluted way of Government making money, then\r\n\r\nGovernment  has immense capacity, more than  what  people\r\n\r\nthink.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that the future is uncertain and success is\r\n\r\nnever  guaranteed.   But  that is  quite  different  from\r\n\r\nsaying  that we are beaten as a nation, and we  had  best\r\n\r\njust lie back and play the vanquished.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must have greater mettle and be fully\r\n\r\nconfident.   To  me, accepting these  CPF  changes  is  a\r\n\r\ndecisive response\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2911</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat shows the resolve to do what is needed; to be nimble\r\n\r\nand  to adjust, as Dr Tan Cheng Bock said.  It signals  a\r\n\r\nnation  on  the  move,  willing  to  make  sacrifices  to\r\n\r\nsurvive. It is not only about what needs to be done,  but\r\n\r\nthat we can do it at all.  As Mrs Fang Ai Lian said,  the\r\n\r\nkey significance is that we can execute.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if some other calamity befalls us tomorrow and\r\n\r\nsets these efforts back, this nation will bounce back and\r\n\r\ndo  more, if that is what is needed to improve our lot in\r\n\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members have asked for a clear economic plan.\r\n\r\nThe  Prime Minister will elaborate on this tomorrow.  But\r\n\r\nas  many Members also know, where it comes to matters  of\r\n\r\nbusiness, as it does affairs of the heart, it is  not  so\r\n\r\nsimple.  It is not so completely deterministic.  There is\r\n\r\nno  magic formula.  But we can learn from others.   There\r\n\r\nare some general ingredients for success.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History is replete with examples of countries that\r\n\r\nwere content to lie in the present, resisting change  and\r\n\r\nlanded  on the slippery slope because they chose  not  to\r\n\r\nconfront  their problems and new realities  head-on.   On\r\n\r\nthis,  I  agree with Mr Inderjit Singh that  we  have  to\r\n\r\ntackle our problems head-on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has a particularly venerable history. It\r\n\r\nboasted  inventions such as printing  and  paper  in  the\r\n\r\nninth  century,  gunpowder  in  the  11th  century,   the\r\n\r\ncompass,  porcelain.   The Chinese invented  machines  to\r\n\r\nspin hemp in the 12th century, some 500 years before  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Revolution began in England.  China  had  the\r\n\r\nknowledge  capital  and advantage  over  many  countries.\r\n\r\nWith  its  inventions, it could have been  the  first  to\r\n\r\nprint  books  for the masses to accelerate learning.   It\r\n\r\ncould  have  experienced  its own industrial  revolution.\r\n\r\nWith  gunpowder, it could have revolutionised the science\r\n\r\nof propulsion for industry or military gains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could have but then China - the self-absorbed\r\n\r\nCelestial empire - closed its\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2912</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nminds to progress and its own strengths and opportunities\r\n\r\nand became insular.  From the 15th century, other nations\r\n\r\npulled  ahead.  So for the last 500 years, China lumbered\r\n\r\nalong,  living on past glory.  But the dragon has stirred\r\n\r\nand  all in its wake felt the pounding of its steps  when\r\n\r\nit  threw  open its doors and chose to engage the  modern\r\n\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan's income rose from 20% of the United States'\r\n\r\nin  1950  to  75% by 1998.  It is a rise unparalleled  in\r\n\r\nrecorded  history.   This phoenix rose miraculously  from\r\n\r\nits   atomic  ashes  and  dazzled  the  world  with   its\r\n\r\nmanufacturing prowess.  But in the last two decades, when\r\n\r\nfaced  with much lesser challenges, it lacked  that  same\r\n\r\nresolve to pull itself out of its quagmire.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 750 to 1100 AD, Islamic science and technology\r\n\r\nfar surpassed that of Europe.  In their golden years, the\r\n\r\nworld's  greatest  scientists wrote  in  Arabic.   Indeed\r\n\r\nduring  that  period,  many  Muslims  taught  science  to\r\n\r\nEuropeans,  especially at the frontiers like Spain  where\r\n\r\nintermixing   occurred.   Then  something   went   wrong.\r\n\r\nReligious  zealots denounced Islamic science  as  heresy.\r\n\r\nThese   nations  regressed  as  they  chose  a  parochial\r\n\r\nemphasis on religious conformity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any group or nation - no matter how mighty - that\r\n\r\ndiscards   knowledge,   prefers  form   over   substance,\r\n\r\nsacrifices  future  needs for present  comforts,  resists\r\n\r\nchange,  erects barriers to progress, is doomed to  fail.\r\n\r\nUltimately, these barriers are self-destructive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic historians, such as Stephen Parente and\r\n\r\nEdward  Prescott in their book \"Barriers to Riches\"  tell\r\n\r\nus  that the differences in living standards have  little\r\n\r\nto  do  with natural resources - or levels of investment.\r\n\r\nRather,  they  see the differences in the intensity  that\r\n\r\nvarious  countries make of the world's existing stock  of\r\n\r\nknow-how.  Countries that are open to the flow of ideas - and whose laws, customs and institutions encourage wealth\r\n\r\ncreation   -   can  catch  up  with  the  old-established\r\n\r\n\"industrial\" economies.  Japan, Korea and recently  China\r\n\r\nare outstanding examples of this catch-up.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2913</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, while all countries will walk\r\n\r\nthrough  hills and valleys, some walk right into  ravines\r\n\r\nor get mired in swamps.  Others stay still and get hemmed\r\n\r\nin  and  suffocated by the overgrowth.  Those that  erect\r\n\r\nbarriers,  both physical and mental, will  be  overtaken.\r\n\r\nOnly  those who choose to engage progress wholeheartedly,\r\n\r\nexpand  their  minds  and  economic  space,  survive  and\r\n\r\nthrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the million dollar question that many MPs\r\n\r\nhave asked?  Even if Singapore is willing to change, will\r\n\r\nthese changes be enough?  Who does fortune favour?  While\r\n\r\nhistory  teaches us that nations that do not  change  are\r\n\r\noften  overtaken, it also shows us that \"fortune  favours\r\n\r\nthe well prepared.\"  Tenacity, diligence, boldness and  a\r\n\r\ncohesive  spirit  have  helped  nations,  in  more   dire\r\n\r\ncircumstances  than Singapore is today,  pull  themselves\r\n\r\nout  of the rut.  I will give two examples and use  city-states for comparability.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Ireland as the first example. In 1840, the\r\n\r\nIrish population was nine million but, a decade later, it\r\n\r\nwas  halved:  over  a  million died of  starvation;  most\r\n\r\nemigrated;  a quarter of those who boarded the  ill-fated\r\n\r\ncoffin  ships to America died in transit.  After emerging\r\n\r\nas the Irish Free State, it promptly plunged into a civil\r\n\r\nwar that lasted until 1923.  At that time, the population\r\n\r\nincluded  fewer than three million people and  was  still\r\n\r\ndwindling.  In other words, they lost six million  people\r\n\r\nin 80 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To demonstrate economic \"self-sufficiency\" as well\r\n\r\nas   political  independence,  Ireland  adopted   inward-looking, protectionist policies - high tariffs,  bans  on\r\n\r\nmajority foreign ownership in industry, the establishment\r\n\r\nof   state-owned  enterprises  in  areas  such  as  power\r\n\r\ngeneration,  shipping,  banking  and  insurance.    These\r\n\r\npolicies   were  pursued  well  into  the   1950s,   with\r\n\r\nincreasingly  perverse results.  The  economy  stagnated,\r\n\r\nemigration  soared  even further, as  more  than  400,000\r\n\r\npeople  left Ireland between 1951 and 1961.  In the  mid-80s,  the unemployment rate reached 17%, the government's\r\n\r\nfinances were in shambles, and submission to a draconian\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2914</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational   Monetary   Fund   (IMF)   programme   was\r\n\r\nconsidered  as  a  means of getting the economy  back  on\r\n\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something happened. At the end of the year\r\n\r\n2000,   Ireland   could  look  back  on   14   years   of\r\n\r\nuninterrupted  economic growth, which had accelerated  to\r\n\r\nnearly  10%  annually.   With this growth  came  markedly\r\n\r\nlower inflation, one of the lowest unemployment rates  in\r\n\r\nthe  European  Union,  and  a  growing  government-budget\r\n\r\nsurplus.   Most  dramatic, however,  was  the  return  to\r\n\r\nIreland,  a  country which had seen emigration  over  100\r\n\r\nyears, of young workers in increasing numbers to fill new\r\n\r\njobs awaiting them at home.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they reverse their terrible plight? It was\r\n\r\nnot just due to the luck of the Irish.  In the 1960s that\r\n\r\ntenacious  Irish  spirit  rallied.   The  government  and\r\n\r\npeople  decided  to  adopt low  corporate  tax  rates  to\r\n\r\nencourage foreign investments.  At a time when they could\r\n\r\nleast  afford, they spent more on educating their  people\r\n\r\nbetter and establish high-tech industries, especially  in\r\n\r\ninfo-technology and telecommunications.   Ireland  joined\r\n\r\nthe  European Union.  In the 1990s, true to the  aphorism\r\n\r\nthat \"fortune favours the well prepared\", a technological\r\n\r\ndiscontinuity,  which brought about plummeting  costs  in\r\n\r\ntelecommunication services, was the chance  element  that\r\n\r\nhelped start an economic boom in Ireland.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second example is Finland. Finland is another\r\n\r\nexample  of a tenacious people that refused to be  beaten\r\n\r\ndown.  Tucked away in the northern-most corner of Europe,\r\n\r\nfive million dedicated Finns continue to demonstrate  the\r\n\r\nfierce  nationalism that has enabled them to  survive  an\r\n\r\nunforgiving  climate as well as a turbulent history.   It\r\n\r\nis  a  land repeatedly fought over through the centuries.\r\n\r\nFinland  underwent  a  transition from  frozen  isolation\r\n\r\nalong the Arctic Circle into a centre of high technology,\r\n\r\nwith  a  population  both  technologically  literate  and\r\n\r\npolitically sophisticated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice in the 20th century, Finland had been written\r\n\r\noff  as lost: first, in the \"Winter War\" in 1939 when the\r\n\r\nFinns were\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2915</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nleft  alone to face invasion by a Russian army  50  times\r\n\r\nits  size,  and  again at the end of World  War  II  when\r\n\r\nFinland was given over to the Soviet sphere of influence.\r\n\r\nIn  the early 1990s, the Soviet empire fragmented and the\r\n\r\nRouble  collapsed.  Finland's economy, which was  closely\r\n\r\ntied to that of the Soviet Union, also shrank sharply and\r\n\r\nunemployment rose.  Yet, it has managed to  come  out  of\r\n\r\nits troubles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How? Government and industry made dramatic efforts\r\n\r\nto  surge  into  the world's new information  technology,\r\n\r\nsupported by one of the most highly skilled labour forces\r\n\r\nin  the  world.   Finland, today, is rightly  called  the\r\n\r\ntelecommunications laboratory of the European Union, with\r\n\r\nan  exceptional hi-tech infrastructure.  Many of us  know\r\n\r\nas  we  use  their Nokia phones.  This,  in  addition  to\r\n\r\nindustrial     production    ranging     from     complex\r\n\r\ninstrumentation  for  meteorological  and   environmental\r\n\r\nsciences,  to medical diagnostic equipment, to  automated\r\n\r\nwood-harvesting machinery, to innovative icebreakers  and\r\n\r\nluxurious  cruise  ships.  In the late  1990s,  Finland's\r\n\r\neconomic  growth  rate  was one of  the  highest  of  the\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Ireland and Finland expect to prosper\r\n\r\nindefinitely?  No one knows, and no guarantees exist  for\r\n\r\nany state.  All economies are subject to the vicissitudes\r\n\r\nof  cycles  and  providence.  Ireland  and  Finland  face\r\n\r\nsimilar  problems like Singapore, as a result of slowdown\r\n\r\nin  global  economic demand.  As do many other countries.\r\n\r\nWe  are not alone.  We need not be narcissistic.  We  can\r\n\r\ncommiserate.  Who will emerge to prosper depends  on  how\r\n\r\neach nation's people respond.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans' response to these CPF changes has\r\n\r\nrenewed my confidence.  Members of this House should  not\r\n\r\nunder-estimate  the disasters that await  us  if  we  had\r\n\r\nchosen  to  stay on our previous course.  Neither  should\r\n\r\nthey under-estimate the impact and the signals that these\r\n\r\nCPF  changes have achieved.  We should not downplay.   It\r\n\r\nis not a simple\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2916</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexercise.   These  CPF changes herald a critical  turning\r\n\r\npoint for the better.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retirement adequacy will wreak economic and social\r\n\r\nhavoc on those that will not, cannot or have not provided\r\n\r\nenough.  Minister of State Cedric Foo commented on  this,\r\n\r\nand I agree with him.  I will elaborate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Herald Tribune on 22nd August this\r\n\r\nyear  carried  this  article under the sub-heading,  \"The\r\n\r\nlooming clash of generations\".   I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Four issues are coming together to create a\r\n\r\n\"perfect  storm\":  birth rates below  replacement  level,\r\n\r\nlonger  life  spans, holes in private pension  funds  and\r\n\r\nmassive government fiscal deficits.  The aging generation\r\n\r\nhas been promised much more than can be delivered without\r\n\r\ndramatically   damaging   the   prospects    of    future\r\n\r\ngenerations.  This will be a political battle, a new form\r\n\r\nof  class  warfare  over  scarce resources.   Demographic\r\n\r\ndecline  is  especially apparent in Europe [and  I  would\r\n\r\nadd, Singapore]. In most countries fertility is far below\r\n\r\nreplacement levels.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the state nor the private sector is in a\r\n\r\nposition   to  meet  the  promises  made  to  the   aging\r\n\r\ngeneration.  Tax and deficit levels are already high  and\r\n\r\nwould  have  to  rise  by huge amounts  to  fund  pension\r\n\r\npromises.   Tough  political decisions will  have  to  be\r\n\r\ntaken to change expectations.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet such measures are essential to avoid crippling\r\n\r\ntaxes  on  the  declining percentage of people  in  work.\r\n\r\nIdeally the state should be reducing tax burdens on young\r\n\r\nfamilies   and   taxing  pensions  for  the  able-bodied.\r\n\r\nWhether  the  long-spoiled baby boomers  are  willing  to\r\n\r\nconcede  that  such  measures are  necessary  is  another\r\n\r\nmatter.   They  have the votes to defeat  any  government\r\n\r\nthat would introduce them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn  other  words, unrealistic expectations,  longer  life\r\n\r\nexpectancies, medical advances, demographic  trends  have\r\n\r\nset  up  a  perfect storm that threatens to  disrupt  the\r\n\r\nsocial   fabric  as  one  generation  is  pitted  against\r\n\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate this with an anecdote which\r\n\r\noccurred  in  Germany.  In August  this  year,  a  furore\r\n\r\nerupted  when  a  young  23-year old  German  politician,\r\n\r\nPhilipp  Missfelder, head of the Conservative  opposition\r\n\r\nyouth outfit, criticised politicians from all parties for\r\n\r\n\"betrayal\",  saying Germany's social system favoured  the\r\n\r\nelderly  at  the  expense of the younger generation.   He\r\n\r\nsuggested,  among other solutions, that  those  above  85\r\n\r\nyears - you heard me right, 85 years - should not\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2917</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpect the national system to pay for their hip implants.\r\n\r\nHe being 23, I assume he said, \"Well, 62 years more, if I\r\n\r\ndon't break my hip within that period, and if I break  it\r\n\r\nafter that, then I should pay for it.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older Germans, even those within his own party,\r\n\r\nthreatened  to  \"spank  the  youngster.\"   The   humorous\r\n\r\nresponse did not mask the resolve of the older generation\r\n\r\nto  protect  their perceived sacrosanct  rights,  despite\r\n\r\nthis being an untenable situation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This road has led Germany to the `gloomy valley'.\r\n\r\nThey  are  stuck!   It explains why Chancellor  Schroeder\r\n\r\nchose  to  wade into the political minefield  of  pension\r\n\r\nreform  and  proposed  the  biggest  shake-up  since  the\r\n\r\ncurrent system was set up in 1957.   We should not under-estimate these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes we are making now will ensure that\r\n\r\nthis  Singaporean generation and future generations  will\r\n\r\nremain  nimble,  still able to respond  quickly  to  fast\r\n\r\nchanging  circumstances.   We  would  have  averted   the\r\n\r\nperilous situation where one generation's needs can  only\r\n\r\nbe  met by another's unwilling sacrifice.  We would  have\r\n\r\nbehaved  responsibly by not expecting the next generation\r\n\r\nto shoulder our burdens by providing for our needs now.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now address specific queries from Members\r\n\r\nduring this debate.  Some Members have asked why not  fix\r\n\r\nthe  rate  at  a  lower level, instead  of  a  range.   I\r\n\r\nacknowledge that a variable rate creates uncertainty,  as\r\n\r\nexpressed  by Dr Chong, Mr Iswaran, Ms Irene and  Mr  Tan\r\n\r\nSoo Khoon, and it disrupts long-term planning.  We accept\r\n\r\nthat.   But  global economic shifts have accelerated  and\r\n\r\nimpacted Singapore almost instantaneously.  In this fluid\r\n\r\nenvironment, we need flexibility, even for the  statutory\r\n\r\ncomponent.   It will come under pressure the  moment  you\r\n\r\nfix  it.   And  when you are compelled to lower  it,  the\r\n\r\npsychological effect is greater.  Remember also that even\r\n\r\nwhen  we had fixed it at 40%, it also caused uncertainty.\r\n\r\nWhile  we were at 36%, investors and employers calculated\r\n\r\ndecisions  based  on  that higher target  rate.   Workers\r\n\r\nbased aspirations and lifestyles\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2918</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso on that number, assuming it would be restored.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this exercise and what this debate have done\r\n\r\nvery   successfully  is  to  reset,  retune  and  refocus\r\n\r\nmindsets  to the floor rate.  We have shifted focus  from\r\n\r\nthe  ceiling  rate to the floor rate  of  30%.   So,  now\r\n\r\ninvestors  and  employers know that there is  potentially\r\n\r\nsome  refuge in reduction.  We read over the weekend  how\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  now plan their homes and spending  patterns\r\n\r\non  30%.   Very  quickly,  the  message  has  sunk  home.\r\n\r\nAnything above that is an added bonus.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reiterate that we will give as long a lead time as\r\n\r\npossible if future CPF rate changes are required.  It  is\r\n\r\nnot  envisaged that rates will be changed  from  year  to\r\n\r\nyear.  There is a range but the CPF rate is a blunt tool.\r\n\r\nWe agree.  It will be reset when a systemic adjustment is\r\n\r\nrequired.   It does not have the sensitivity to calibrate\r\n\r\naccording to performances of different companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, many Members of Parliament have called on\r\n\r\ncompanies doing well to pass on profits to workers in the\r\n\r\nform  of  bonuses or other variable components of  wages,\r\n\r\nand  help avoid retrenchments, mentioned by Mr Leong Horn\r\n\r\nKee,  Dr  Ong  Seh  Hong, Mr Heng Chee  How,  Mr  Nithiah\r\n\r\nNandan,  Mr  Andy Gan, Dr Ong Chit Chung and  Mr  Ng  Ser\r\n\r\nMiang.   I  endorse this sentiment, although I would  not\r\n\r\npush for rigid formulas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do want to emphasise the point made by Dr Ong,\r\n\r\nDr  Gan See Khem, Ms Irene Ng and Mr Arthur Fong that our\r\n\r\noverall   wage  structure  needs  to  be  more  flexible,\r\n\r\nallowing   individual  companies  to  vary  their   wages\r\n\r\naccording  to  business circumstances.   Companies'  wage\r\n\r\nstructures  should differentiate performance  and  reward\r\n\r\nindividuals  accordingly,  and  address  the   structural\r\n\r\nrigidities  created  by  seniority-based  systems.    The\r\n\r\nGovernment has initiated a Tripartite Task Force on  wage\r\n\r\nreform  chaired  by  my  Permanent  Secretary  to  assist\r\n\r\ncompanies  in  implementing flexible wage structures.   I\r\n\r\nwill  ask  this  Task Force to study the  suggestions  by\r\n\r\nMembers - Mrs Yu-Foo, Mr Chew\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2919</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeng  Ching and Mr Ng Ser Miang - of using tax incentives\r\n\r\nto encourage companies to reform.  The Task Force will be\r\n\r\npresenting  its recommendations at the end of  the  year,\r\n\r\nand will consider other proposals which Mr Inderjit Singh\r\n\r\nbrought up this afternoon on retrenchment cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to adequacy for retirement and the\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum.  These issues were raised by Mr  Chew,  Mrs\r\n\r\nLim Hwee Hua, Mr Andy Gan and Mr Ahmad Magad.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having adjusted expectations to 30%, can we still\r\n\r\nmeet  the  aspirations  of Singaporeans?   It  is  a  key\r\n\r\nquestion.  Can Singaporeans still own homes and take care\r\n\r\nof  their medical and retirement expenses?  Why  not,  as\r\n\r\nsome  Members suggested, give flexibility in how much  we\r\n\r\nforce  Singaporeans  to  save?  In  other  words,  tailor\r\n\r\nsavings  according to income level.  Dr Ong Seh Hong  and\r\n\r\nMs Irene Ng said we should calibrate savings based on pre-retirement income and income groups.  Mr Chew Heng  Ching\r\n\r\nsaid  the  increases are too fast and should  instead  be\r\n\r\npegged  to  Consumer Price Index inflation.  Dr  Gan  See\r\n\r\nKhem and Dr Jennifer Lee, though disagree, said it is not\r\n\r\nenough as costs are rising.  Mr Inderjit Singh also  said\r\n\r\nnot to make it compulsory.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication in all these points is that perhaps\r\n\r\nwe  should  give up some dreams, even home ownership  for\r\n\r\nsome Singaporeans.  The Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nhas  eloquently defended the policy and  I  will  add  by\r\n\r\nsaying  we  need not.  The vast majority of  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncan, and should, still hold on to their dreams and homes.\r\n\r\nI  will  ask the Clerk of Parliament to now distribute  a\r\n\r\ntable (Cols. 2981-2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2003/20030901/20030901-HA-0762981.htm\">Adequacy of CPF  at  30% CPF Contribution Rate (2981 - 2982)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a useful table as it gives a helicopter view\r\n\r\nof how our current CPF system provides for various needs.\r\n\r\nI  have  kept it simple and I want to focus  on  it.   It\r\n\r\ngives  a  helicopter view of how our current  CPF  system\r\n\r\nhelps meet various social needs.  I would like us to  pay\r\n\r\nattention\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2920</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nalso  to the quantities in the various accounts, in other\r\n\r\nwords,  the Ordinary, Special and Medisave Accounts.   In\r\n\r\nthese  two  columns  I have put the  25th  and  the  50th\r\n\r\npercentile worker to illustrate, but we should just focus\r\n\r\non  the  25th percentile worker.  The 50th percentile  is\r\n\r\nfor  Members' reference.  As the table shows, for a  25th\r\n\r\npercentile  worker with a starting pay of $1,100  and  an\r\n\r\nending  pay  of  $1,000,  we  factored  in  a  number  of\r\n\r\nassumptions,  including wage deflation plus some  periods\r\n\r\nof  disruptive  unemployment -  this  is  not  continuous\r\n\r\nemployment  -  that  25th percentile  worker  would  have\r\n\r\naccrued   $109,000  in  his  Ordinary  Account,  Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount of $41,000 and a Special Account of $55,000.   So\r\n\r\nas  this  table  shows, even at the 25th percentile,  the\r\n\r\nwage  earner can own a 4-room flat if he chooses.  I have\r\n\r\nput  the price range for the 4-room flat in the footnote.\r\n\r\nOn  top  of  that, he would have accrued  enough  in  his\r\n\r\nlifetime  and set aside adequately for his basic  medical\r\n\r\nand retirement expenses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Members of Parliament that we should\r\n\r\nset  our  CPF scheme to cater to basic needs, not frills.\r\n\r\nThe Minimum Sum must be linked to anticipated consumption\r\n\r\nand  life expectancy.  So even at the new Minimum Sum  of\r\n\r\n$60,000  cash component, the annuity payout per month  to\r\n\r\nlast for 18 years is $433.  It is not a princely sum  and\r\n\r\nwe are not over-providing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But note, as some Members pointed out, that if\r\n\r\nconsumption  for  medical  expenses  from  the   Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount  is reduced or if a member chooses to live  in  a\r\n\r\nsmaller  flat, even if he could afford to  buy  a  bigger\r\n\r\none,  substantial spillover can result into  the  Special\r\n\r\nAccount.   The  key  column is to look  at  the  Medisave\r\n\r\nAccount  and  the Special Account.  In other words,  even\r\n\r\nwith  our rules changed, if he does not consume from  the\r\n\r\nMedisave Account, the 25th percentile worker could  still\r\n\r\nwithdraw  $11,000 at age 55, having put aside enough  for\r\n\r\nhis   Medisave  and  Special  Accounts.   He  would  have\r\n\r\nenhanced his Special Account, so more can be withdrawn at\r\n\r\nage 55 if the Minimum Sum and the Medisave\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2921</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimum  Sum  are met.  This is a sensible  system  which\r\n\r\ncaters  to  the  majority  of Singaporeans  with  varying\r\n\r\nconsumption  patterns.  There is rigidity  for  the  base\r\n\r\nrequirements  but  there  is flexibility  for  those  who\r\n\r\nchoose  to be prudent in housing and medical expenditure.\r\n\r\nI  disagree  with  Mr  Tan Soo Khoon  that  we  encourage\r\n\r\nblatantly people to choose bigger houses.  People did  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they knew that if there was some asset inflation\r\n\r\nthey  would  reap benefits.  And, in case  we  are  being\r\n\r\nmisunderstood,  we  have  all  said,  \"live  within  your\r\n\r\nmeans\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we help Singaporeans meet these Minimum\r\n\r\nSums,   a   point   which  Mr  Heng   Chee   How   asked.\r\n\r\nStructurally,  the  new changes, the  reductions  in  the\r\n\r\nOrdinary  Account  and  corresponding  increase  in   the\r\n\r\nSpecial  Account  facilitate this, which  means  that  if\r\n\r\nmembers are sensible in their housing commitments, it  is\r\n\r\nlikely  that some 80% of future CPF members can meet  the\r\n\r\n$120,000  Minimum Sum requirement at a contribution  rate\r\n\r\nof  30%.  Let me emphasise that this is not 33%.  This is\r\n\r\nat 30%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It follows then that when we retune the use of the\r\n\r\nCPF   towards   the  three  objectives   of   retirement,\r\n\r\nhealthcare and housing, we should not further expand  the\r\n\r\nrole  of the CPF to be used for unemployment as suggested\r\n\r\nby  Dr  Wang,  or  other  purposes  such  as  starting  a\r\n\r\nbusiness,   as   suggested  by   Mr   Chiam   See   Tong.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  we  can  explore  the  idea  of  voluntary\r\n\r\nunemployment savings scheme, as suggested by  Dr  Mohamad\r\n\r\nMaliki.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Providing better for retirement</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members have asked for greater returns from\r\n\r\nthe  accumulated  sums  or  to  obtain  different  income\r\n\r\nstreams  - points raised by Mr Chew Heng Ching,  Mrs  Lim\r\n\r\nHwee  Hua, Mr Low Thia Khiang, Dr Ong Seh Hong and Mr  Ng\r\n\r\nSer  Miang  - I agree.  Housing is the biggest asset  for\r\n\r\nmost   Singaporeans  and  the  Minister   has   announced\r\n\r\nrelaxation on rental rules and it should help.   We  have\r\n\r\nexplored   reverse  mortgages  before,  but   the   major\r\n\r\nroadblock  has  been that insurers are only  prepared  to\r\n\r\noffer \"fixed term\" reverse mortgage.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2922</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  runs the risk of the elderly lessees being  evicted\r\n\r\nfrom  their flats should they outlive the tenure of their\r\n\r\nreverse   mortgages,  which  is  a  likely   possibility.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we can always revisit the issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other option is for Singaporeans to sell their\r\n\r\nproperties.   It is an option that is available  to  them\r\n\r\ntoday and it will be made easier with alternative housing\r\n\r\navailable  in  the increase in rental  flats.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords,  people  say, \"Well, they have more  than  200,000\r\n\r\nrental  flats  available.  Why do I  not  sell  and  then\r\n\r\nrent?\"   They  could.  But do we want  to  actively  push\r\n\r\nthis?  I am not so sure.  We should be cautious as it may\r\n\r\nresult  in some being homeless as they sell their  homes.\r\n\r\nAll  of  us, who have meet-the-people-sessions, know  the\r\n\r\nindividual  stories  of some parents being  abandoned  by\r\n\r\nchildren whom they have been persuaded to part with their\r\n\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members talked about interest rates. Can CPF\r\n\r\nincrease interest rates?  The Ordinary Account (OA)  rate\r\n\r\nis  currently determined quarterly based on the  weighted\r\n\r\naverage   of  the  one-year  fixed  deposit   rate   (80%\r\n\r\nweightage)  and the savings account rate (20%  weightage)\r\n\r\nof  the  three  major local banks.  It  is  a  basket  of\r\n\r\nweights.  But we have protected members under the CPF Act\r\n\r\nby  subjecting this to a floor at 2.5%.  Let me quote one\r\n\r\nexample.   DBS  Bank pays only 0.8% for a one-year  fixed\r\n\r\ndeposit  of  more  than  $50,000 and  0.25%  for  savings\r\n\r\naccount  deposits.  So, if we use this formula, I  should\r\n\r\nbe paying OA rate of less than 1%.  Hence, the OA rate of\r\n\r\n2.5% gives a better return to CPF members at present.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Special Account (SA) rate? In this\r\n\r\nregard,  CPF  members are getting more than a  fair  deal\r\n\r\nbecause the Special Account guarantees risk-free  at  4%.\r\n\r\nOne year Singapore Government Treasury bills are yielding\r\n\r\n0.9%  whereas 15-year Government bonds have been yielding\r\n\r\nless  than  4% for the last 12 months and only  begin  to\r\n\r\nyield  more than 4% recently.  So for a person who  makes\r\n\r\nSA  contributions  over  a 30-year  period,  the  15-year\r\n\r\nGovernment  bonds are a good benchmark as 15 years  would\r\n\r\nrepresent the average tenure of his savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2923</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, the CPF Board is studying two\r\n\r\ninitiatives.   Firstly, the Government has  already  said\r\n\r\nthat  in the long term, the interest rates on CPF savings\r\n\r\nwill have to be pegged to market rates.  We need to study\r\n\r\nthis  carefully.  What benchmarks to adopt will also have\r\n\r\nimplications  for HDB housing loans, which are  currently\r\n\r\npegged  at  0.1% above the OA rate.  Whatever  benchmarks\r\n\r\nthat are adopted must lead to a sustainable interest rate\r\n\r\npaid  on CPF savings.  But I agree though that new models\r\n\r\nwill  have  to be adopted to maximise retirement  returns\r\n\r\nfor  Singaporeans  so  that we  can  better  provide  for\r\n\r\nretirement needs - points raised by Mr Andy Gan, Mr Ahmad\r\n\r\nMagad  and  Mr Chew Heng Ching.  In line with  the  ERC's\r\n\r\nrecommendations, the CPF Board has begun to  explore  the\r\n\r\nrole of private fund managers to get better efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThis  was suggested by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Ms Irene Ng  and\r\n\r\nMr  Ng  Ser  Miang.  The intention is to pool savings  to\r\n\r\nachieve  economies  of scales so  as  to  lower  cost  of\r\n\r\ninvestments  for  members,  achieve  higher  returns  and\r\n\r\ngreater  certainty of income.  The CPF Board is currently\r\n\r\nworking  to implement low-cost privately-managed  pension\r\n\r\nplans  (PPPs)  as  an  additional option  under  the  CPF\r\n\r\nInvestment  Scheme.   This would give  members  a  better\r\n\r\nchance of higher long-term returns by investing in a well-diversified  portfolio.  These PPPs  should  not  require\r\n\r\nmembers  to make complicated decisions.  In other  words,\r\n\r\nwe do not envisage a buffet menu.  We will keep it simple\r\n\r\nand understandable.  This is to cater to the majority  of\r\n\r\nCPF members who are not investment-savvy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with Dr Chong, Mr Ahmad Magad and Ms\r\n\r\nIndranee   Rajah   that  the  CPF  Board   must   educate\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  as part of its mandate.  The Board  intends\r\n\r\nto start a process of investor education for its members,\r\n\r\nstructured according to a member's life events.  In other\r\n\r\nwords,  instead of waiting for you to log on to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard,  we  will  track and push you information  roughly\r\n\r\nbefore your marrying age or before the age that you  will\r\n\r\nbuy a property or start work, and tell you that these are\r\n\r\nthe sums that you need to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2924</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncalculate.   It  flags up.  It causes you to  focus  your\r\n\r\nmind  on  a  particular financial aspect.  These  modules\r\n\r\nwill  be  made available to members through the web.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  the  CPF  Board is working with  the  Monetary\r\n\r\nAuthority  of Singapore as part of an overall  effort  to\r\n\r\neducate  investors because our surveys  have  shown  that\r\n\r\nwhile awareness is there, the majority of CPF members are\r\n\r\nstill  not  taking concrete steps to plan for retirement.\r\n\r\nWith  the  ageing  population, longer life-span  and  the\r\n\r\nretuning  of  the CPF, it is now even more important  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to take retirement planning seriously.  This\r\n\r\nincludes  the  promotion of the use of the  Supplementary\r\n\r\nRetirement Scheme, as suggested by Mr Ahmad Magad and  Dr\r\n\r\nMohamad Maliki.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For specific groups, women and homemakers, suggested\r\n\r\nby  Ms Irene Ng, Dr Jennifer Lee and Ms Braema Mathi,  we\r\n\r\nwill explore ways to improve their retirement adequacy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For part-time and casual workers, the point brought\r\n\r\nup  by  Dr  Gan  See  Khem, the  CPF  Board  has  already\r\n\r\nimplemented the ERC's recommendation to raise  the  floor\r\n\r\nfor CPF contribution from the earlier threshold range  of\r\n\r\n$200-$363 to a new threshold range of $500-$750.   But  I\r\n\r\nagree  with  Mr Zainudin Nordin that we should facilitate\r\n\r\ncollection of CPF dues.  The late payments form less than\r\n\r\n1%   of  all  accounts,  but  we  can  still  improve  by\r\n\r\ncollecting  CPF  through  electronic  means.    We   will\r\n\r\nexpedite this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Retaining Jobs, Job Redesign, Placements and Training</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Nithiah Nandan, Dr\r\n\r\nWang Kai Yuen, Mr Heng Chee How, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr\r\n\r\nAng  Mong  Seng that we should use these sacrifices  that\r\n\r\nworkers  have  made to translate to more jobs.   The  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges will position us well for job creation.   At  the\r\n\r\nmargins,  it already has positive signals and, again,  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  diminish our efforts.  For example,  Venture\r\n\r\nCorporations  and  Philips  Electronics  Singapore   both\r\n\r\nwelcome the changes.  Venture Corporations told our staff\r\n\r\nthat\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2925</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntogether  with their efforts to improve their  employees'\r\n\r\ncapabilities  and  skills, these CPF cuts  will  \"give  a\r\n\r\nboost  to  migrating more businesses and  investments  to\r\n\r\nSingapore\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the meantime, we must redouble our efforts to\r\n\r\nplace  Singaporeans in jobs.  We have to work  faster  to\r\n\r\ndevelop sectors that Singapore can be competitive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, all of us must do more to place\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  in jobs that are available today  -  points\r\n\r\nbrought  up by Dr Warren Lee and Mr Ang Mong Seng.   They\r\n\r\nsaid  that we should raise again the importance of  local\r\n\r\nworkers  being  willing to take menial tasks.   I  agree.\r\n\r\nBut  we  have also seen good evidence of worker  attitude\r\n\r\nchanging  in  the past half year.  And I  agree  with  Mr\r\n\r\nNithiah Nandan that not all workers are choosy.  We  must\r\n\r\nnot  tar  all workers with the same brush.  For instance,\r\n\r\nmany  cleaning companies have told us that they  can  now\r\n\r\nhire locals for cleaning jobs and they do not need to ask\r\n\r\nfor so many foreign workers.  This is good news.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is much more that we can do. We have come\r\n\r\nto a point where MOM goes down to the ground - you should\r\n\r\nallow  your  policy  instruments to  do  that  -  but  we\r\n\r\nrecognise this is a transitionary period and we  want  to\r\n\r\nget  a  better  feel of the ground.  During  one  of  our\r\n\r\ndialogues, a unionist told me that some Singaporeans dare\r\n\r\nnot work in hotel kitchens because they feel isolated, as\r\n\r\nthey  are  the  only  Singaporeans  there,  or  that  the\r\n\r\nsupervisor is a foreigner and is perceived to be  partial\r\n\r\nto  hiring more foreigners.  It is unlikely to  be  true,\r\n\r\nbut  it  is  a perception.  We must and will break  these\r\n\r\npsychological  barriers  down.   My  Ministry  has   been\r\n\r\nworking   closely  with  the  hotel  sector   to   better\r\n\r\nunderstand  how  to successfully place Singaporeans  into\r\n\r\njobs  in  this  sector which has so many vacancies.   The\r\n\r\nhotel  management assures us that they are  committed  to\r\n\r\nhelp  make this happen.  In parallel, I have asked  union\r\n\r\nleaders of NTUC unions to get their members to mentor new\r\n\r\nworkers.   In  other words, let us accept the  insecurity\r\n\r\nand the uncertainty.  So, from the over 400,000\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2926</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmembers  that NUTC has, members can perhaps find  mentors\r\n\r\nthat  stay  in  the  same estate with  the  new  workers,\r\n\r\ntravel,  eat together in the same company so that  during\r\n\r\nthe earlier adjustment period, it will tide them over and\r\n\r\nhelp them to stay in the job.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yes, we should improve the efficiency of job\r\n\r\nmatching   and  information  provision.   The   Workforce\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Agency (WDA) will be launched soon  to  give\r\n\r\nthis  greater focus.  As suggested by Mr Seng Han  Thong,\r\n\r\nwe   will  have  to  make  sure  that  training  is  more\r\n\r\neffective.   And I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  to  upgrade our skills in our construction,  retail\r\n\r\nand restaurants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have asked that we look for solutions,\r\n\r\nin  terms of social safety net in force.  But when we are\r\n\r\nin  a  situation where there are large numbers of foreign\r\n\r\nworkers and jobs available that Singaporeans do not  want\r\n\r\nto take, I believe that we should focus on the message of\r\n\r\ngetting people into jobs, not subsidising people for  not\r\n\r\nworking.  And the measures that DPM announced on  Friday,\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the Training for Employment scheme, the People-for-Jobs   Traineeship  Programme,  the  Work  Assistance\r\n\r\nProgramme, hold to this philosophy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree also that employers must play their part.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  am  glad  that the Singapore National  Employers'\r\n\r\nFederation  and  the Singapore Business  Federation  have\r\n\r\ncome  out  in  strong  support for these  cuts.   We  all\r\n\r\nunderstand that the business climate is competitive.  But\r\n\r\nthere  are  many employers that we have come across  that\r\n\r\nare  competitive and, yet, treat their workers well.   As\r\n\r\nMr  Ahmad  Khalis says, retrenchment should be minimised.\r\n\r\nThere   should  be  less  discrimination  against   older\r\n\r\nworkers,  a point raised by Mr Nithiah Nandan.  The  cost\r\n\r\nof  hiring mature workers would be less because of  these\r\n\r\nCPF  changes, and older workers bring value through their\r\n\r\nexperience and networking.  They are also likely to  stay\r\n\r\nlonger on their jobs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have good employers in Singapore. You may have\r\n\r\nread  about  Murata Singapore.  It has been in  Singapore\r\n\r\nfor over 30\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2927</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears.   I  visited them at the National  Day  Observance\r\n\r\nCeremony  and  they  told me they had  not  retrenched  a\r\n\r\nsingle worker for the last 30 years.  I thought they  got\r\n\r\nit  wrong.  I asked, \"Are you sure?\"  They said, \"Yah, we\r\n\r\ndon't.  We have not retrenched a single worker.\"  So,  in\r\n\r\ngood  times,  a  company rewards the  workers  well  with\r\n\r\nadditional  bonuses.   But  in  bad  times,  they  adjust\r\n\r\nvarious flexible schemes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Braema Mathi brought up a point about United\r\n\r\nParcel  Services (UPS).  And she is right.  It is a  good\r\n\r\ncompany with enlightened human resource practices.   UPS,\r\n\r\nled  by  Singaporean  Managing Director,  Mary  Yeo,  has\r\n\r\nencouraged    multi-tasking   and    emphasised    career\r\n\r\ndevelopment for their van drivers.  During SARS,  workers\r\n\r\nwillingly worked flexible hours.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon has highlighted that we should\r\n\r\ntailor  our solutions for older workers to upgrade  their\r\n\r\nskills  and  find jobs.  We agree.  Companies  must  play\r\n\r\ntheir  part to accommodate older workers who may be  able\r\n\r\nto do the job very well.  One HR manager told us that her\r\n\r\ncompany  had  problems with production  in  some  of  the\r\n\r\nplants.   This  is  on a productivity  issue.   But  this\r\n\r\nobservant  HR  manager noted that workers  were  standing\r\n\r\nbecause  of the height of the production line,  and  that\r\n\r\nshorter workers had difficulty doing the work because the\r\n\r\nline  was  too high for them.  Minor adjustment  was  all\r\n\r\nthat  was  needed  to  raise productivity.   This  sounds\r\n\r\nsimple,  but simple things are often not done.   So  this\r\n\r\nstory  should  cheer  Mr Seng Han  Thong  who  called  on\r\n\r\ncompanies to help local workers through job redesign.  We\r\n\r\nall agree, and more can be done.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But apart from wages and jobs, at the end of this\r\n\r\ndebate, the question that will still remain in our  minds\r\n\r\nis:  will Singapore prosper again?  Mr Tan Soo Khoon said\r\n\r\nthat  the music had died for him in 1998.  Will Singapore\r\n\r\nprosper  again?   It  depends.   It  depends  on  whether\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  think our way of life is worth  preserving.\r\n\r\nIt depends if Singaporeans think this\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2928</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nplace  is  worth fighting for, not with bullets of  steel\r\n\r\nbut   with  steely  resolve,  an  innovative  spirit   to\r\n\r\ncapitalise on our strengths, diligence and determination.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the Singapore Dream dead? As Mark Twain said,\r\n\r\nthe news of the demise has been grossly exaggerated.  Far\r\n\r\nfrom  it. This doctor has examined the patient and  found\r\n\r\nit  well.   The patient is not sick.  She only  needs  to\r\n\r\nshed  a  few  pounds.   Too many  good  years  and  over-indulgence  have  added girth.  Some weight  trimming  is\r\n\r\nnecessary and may not be bad for overall health.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the contribution rate at 30%, the majority\r\n\r\nof  Singaporeans can own homes and retire adequately with\r\n\r\ntheir medical and retirement needs taken care of, if they\r\n\r\nare   prudent.   As  I  earlier  showed,  even  the  25th\r\n\r\npercentile  worker  can still afford a  4-room  flat  and\r\n\r\nwould have provided enough for his medical and retirement\r\n\r\nneeds till 80.  How many countries can achieve that?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every child born in Singapore today can be\r\n\r\ncertain  of 12 years of solid education.  Mr Ong Ah  Heng\r\n\r\njoked that perhaps the Government should just kelong  and\r\n\r\ngive 4-D tickets to Singaporeans.  In fact, we have.  Let\r\n\r\nme  tell  you  why.   Every student is  subsidised  about\r\n\r\n$4,000  for  each  year  in  primary  school,  $6,000  in\r\n\r\nsecondary  school,  $8,000  in  ITE,  Junior  College  or\r\n\r\npolytechnic, and $11,000 in university.  This means  that\r\n\r\nevery  child born in Singapore receives at least  $60,000\r\n\r\nin  education  subsidies.   This  is  not  including  the\r\n\r\nhousing  subsidy.  70% will obtain higher education  that\r\n\r\nis  the  passport anywhere in the world  to  further  his\r\n\r\nstudy.  Access to good medical care will continue  to  be\r\n\r\navailable  to  the masses, not only to the privileged  or\r\n\r\nthe  rich.   Here,  in Singapore, you  walk  the  streets\r\n\r\nfeeling   much  safer  than  in  many  other   countries.\r\n\r\nChildren  grow up well here.  We, the adults, spend  half\r\n\r\nthe  time debating why we spoil them, and the other  half\r\n\r\nasking  why  we  stress them.  The same  debate  will  be\r\n\r\ncontinued by our children when they become adults.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I believe so emphatically that Singapore will\r\n\r\nnot only overcome but\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2929</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat we will prosper further?  The music has not stopped.\r\n\r\nBecause  Singaporeans will not falter.  Years  of  nation\r\n\r\nbuilding    have    bonded   a   people    with    unique\r\n\r\ncharacteristics.  Shared pains and gains have  created  a\r\n\r\nuniquely Singaporean way, that is, a way of life that  is\r\n\r\nworth   preserving   -   with   all   its   quirks    and\r\n\r\neccentricities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Dr Tan Cheng Bock that Singaporean can\r\n\r\ndo.    His  ingrained  beliefs  in  hard  work,  justice,\r\n\r\nintegrity  are  universal premiums.  I travel  frequently\r\n\r\nand I meet many Presidents of Ivy League universities  in\r\n\r\nUSA.   They  tell me that there is only one  thing  wrong\r\n\r\nwith Singaporean students - that there are not enough  of\r\n\r\nthem.  They say this even though Singapore students  form\r\n\r\nthe  largest  contingent from any  state,  including  the\r\n\r\nstates of the United States.  They want more of us.  They\r\n\r\nwax  lyrical about how they wish every freshman performed\r\n\r\nlike  our  Singaporeans.   Of course,  in  typical  Asian\r\n\r\nhumility,  I  respond  by saying,  \"Well,  we  have  some\r\n\r\nstrengths, but many weaknesses too.\"  But, inwardly, when\r\n\r\nthey tell me this, I swell with pride.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs of multi-national corporations here in the\r\n\r\nbiopharmaceutical and process industry sectors tell  that\r\n\r\nwe  have  among the best technical workers in the  world.\r\n\r\nThey  have  one  wish - that Singaporeans would  be  less\r\n\r\ndriven,  because  many  of them leave  to  further  their\r\n\r\neducation,  not content to stay still.  But I  like  this\r\n\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies tell us that two positions, when\r\n\r\nthey  go overseas, must be occupied by Singaporeans,  ie,\r\n\r\nthe  manager  and  the  financial controller.   Why?   No\r\n\r\nprizes  for  those who guess the reason  -  because  they\r\n\r\ntrust   Singaporeans.   Despite  the  catch-up  of  other\r\n\r\ncountries,  like China and India, we can still  hold  our\r\n\r\nown in technical and engineering skills.  Our efforts  in\r\n\r\neducating Singaporeans still stand us in good stead.   Do\r\n\r\nnot  under-estimate these strengths nor  our  ability  to\r\n\r\nread these changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I overly optimistic? Do I not fear the tiger of\r\n\r\nglobalisation, the challenges that Members paint and  the\r\n\r\ncompanies  tell us?  Well, when a tiger is  chasing  you,\r\n\r\nyou\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2930</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nneed not be the fastest to survive.

With these CPF  and  wage\r\n\r\nreforms,  we would have further lightened our loads.   We\r\n\r\nare well positioned to avoid hazards and pitfalls.  If we\r\n\r\ncontinue  on  this  new road, expand  our  minds  to  see\r\n\r\npossibilities   and  capitalise  on  our  strengths   and\r\n\r\nopportunities, we will prosper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> May I seek a\r\n\r\nclarification from the Acting Minister?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I refer to the table\r\n\r\ndistributed  by the Acting Minister.

I  wonder  why  the  Acting\r\n\r\nMinister has chosen the 25th percentile of workers, as  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  CPF  covers  from  the  20th   to   80th\r\n\r\npercentile of workers.  So what is the situation  at  the\r\n\r\nlowest  20th  percentile?

Our CPF Act and  its\r\n\r\npredecessor  legislation, during and  prior  to  the  PAP\r\n\r\ncoming  into  power, have, in some way,  made  compulsory\r\n\r\nsaving  of citizen's moneys to form the Central Provident\r\n\r\nFund  and out of which authorised payments are made.   On\r\n\r\nthe  whole, it has brought a great deal of advantages  to\r\n\r\nour citizens and working population in Singapore.  It has\r\n\r\nalso  brought  a large amount of money to our  Government\r\n\r\nand,  hopefully, it has been used to invest and reap some\r\n\r\ngood  returns.  It would be ideal if these,  or  some  of\r\n\r\nthese  returns,  could be ploughed back  to  CPF  account\r\n\r\nholders as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website of CPF Board provides that the mission\r\n\r\nof  CPF  is \"to enable Singaporeans to save for a  secure\r\n\r\nretirement\".   And its vision is that of  \"a  world-class\r\n\r\nsocial  security organisation providing the best national\r\n\r\nsavings  scheme  for  Singaporeans  to  enjoy  a   secure\r\n\r\nretirement\".   The emphasis has always been  savings  for\r\n\r\nour retirement.  Our Government must guide our people  to\r\n\r\nensure that, as far as possible, the retirement needs  of\r\n\r\nthe  majority of our citizens would be met.  It would  be\r\n\r\nin  the Government's interest to ensure this because,  if\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  great  shortfall in this  CPF  scheme,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment, being a responsible one, would have  to  lean\r\n\r\ntowards a more \"welfare-oriented\" and socialist political\r\n\r\nsystem  which the PAP Government tries to avoid  directly\r\n\r\nas far as possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corporate philosophy of CPF is, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"a social security savings scheme jointly supported\r\n\r\nby  employees, employers and the Government.  CPF members\r\n\r\nare employees and self-employed persons in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic purpose of the CPF is to help members meet\r\n\r\nprimary  needs  like shelter, food, clothing  and  health\r\n\r\nservices in their old age or when they are no longer able\r\n\r\nto  work.  Benefits offered are to help meet one or  more\r\n\r\nneeds  of the CPF member in his retirement.  They include\r\n\r\nwithdrawals  by  the  member  for  retirement,  permanent\r\n\r\ndisablement,  home  ownership  and  medical  care.    The\r\n\r\namounts available depend on how much the member has saved\r\n\r\nin the CPF.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board is the trustee of members' CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.  They seek to protect and preserve the value\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2932</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the  savings.   They provide fair market  returns  at\r\n\r\nminimal  risk, while opening avenues for members to  seek\r\n\r\nhigher  returns on their own after carefully  considering\r\n\r\nthe  risks  involved.  The guiding principle is prudence.\r\n\r\nAny  return should contribute towards the member's  well-being in his retirement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would appear that the above stated\r\n\r\nphilosophy may need to be modified in difficult  economic\r\n\r\ntimes.   The Prime Minister touched on globalisation  and\r\n\r\nhow  it  has continued to affect our economy.  There  are\r\n\r\nadvantages and disadvantages in globalisation.   The  two\r\n\r\ngiant  nations,  China and India,  with  over  2  billion\r\n\r\npeople,  are  and will be, population-wise and  business-wise, forces to be reckoned with in the premier league of\r\n\r\nnations in the global economic arena.  Singapore can  try\r\n\r\nbut  realistically would find it very difficult to be  in\r\n\r\nthe  premier league because, in terms of population  base\r\n\r\nand  business  base,  production of goods  and  services,\r\n\r\ninvention  and  information technology, manufacturing  of\r\n\r\nhigh-end technological products, production of university\r\n\r\nscholars,  scientists,  inventors,  engineers,   doctors,\r\n\r\narchitects  or  any  professional  groupings,   political\r\n\r\nleaders  and  tertiary  professors  and,  in  many  other\r\n\r\nrespects,  touching on economic and other considerations,\r\n\r\nit is realistically impossible.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Singapore must and will no doubt do its\r\n\r\nlevel  best  to survive comfortably and progress  in  the\r\n\r\nface of all the competition from near and far.  And since\r\n\r\nwe   have   reached  first-world  standard,  economically\r\n\r\nspeaking,  our  citizenry would expect that  standard  of\r\n\r\nliving  in the years to come.  Singaporeans would have  a\r\n\r\ntough  time trying to aspire to reach this target as  the\r\n\r\nyears  go  by.   We  have a disciplined  and  hardworking\r\n\r\npopulation that will fight hard to advance as  the  years\r\n\r\ngo  by.   We  have  a  good  Government,  civil  service,\r\n\r\njudiciary, rule of law, caring nation with many voluntary\r\n\r\nand  Government-sponsored community of  volunteers.   All\r\n\r\nthese good institutions have served us well the last  few\r\n\r\ndecades and will continue to do so.  But is it sufficient\r\n\r\nin the future?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should have and must have known all\r\n\r\nthis was coming many\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2933</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyears  ago.  The citizens knew and constantly talked  and\r\n\r\ncomplained  about the high cost of business in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not  new  at  all.  On hindsight,  perhaps  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should have acted earlier,  even  before  the\r\n\r\nGeneral  Elections in 2001.  At least, we are now  trying\r\n\r\nto  make amends.  It is never too late.  Let us all  work\r\n\r\ntogether  as  Singaporeans.  I believe our Government  is\r\n\r\ntrying hard, but more needs to be done by one and all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporary measures require us to be cost-effective.\r\n\r\nThis means we have to cut down on CPF and all other forms\r\n\r\nof cost-cutting measures.  We have to be lean and fit for\r\n\r\na  race that is going to be very competitive for the next\r\n\r\nfew  years.  CPF cuts alone would not be a great help  in\r\n\r\nbringing in more investments from abroad and locally and,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  more employment for our people.  However,  it\r\n\r\nis  a strong signal to the world looking at Singapore, as\r\n\r\na  country to invest in, that our Government is trying to\r\n\r\ncut  down  on business costs.  More cost-cutting measures\r\n\r\nmust  be  put  in place sooner than later.  And  this  is\r\n\r\nessential  and  is an emergency, as a lot  of  businesses\r\n\r\nfrom   Singapore  and  the  ASEAN  countries  are   going\r\n\r\nespecially  to China and India.  And it is well  possible\r\n\r\nthat there would be even more competition in the business\r\n\r\nworld,  as  Malaysia and other ASEAN  countries  move  on\r\n\r\nprogressively to catch up with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a race between premier league nations,\r\n\r\nDivisions 1, 2 and 3 and amateur teams, with the same set\r\n\r\nof  rules  and  there  are no handicaps  given  to  small\r\n\r\nnations.   Singapore must find innovative ways to  be  in\r\n\r\nthe  top league.  How do top premier league players  stay\r\n\r\non  top?  They devise various means, including looking at\r\n\r\nthe  world's  best  players and managers,  training  them\r\n\r\nprofessionally  and paying them well.  We  also  need  to\r\n\r\nlook  at  not  just  the  best  companies  and  top-notch\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs, but also the potential nations as business\r\n\r\nand  economic  partners.  Our Cabinet Ministers  and  top\r\n\r\nGovernment  officials  have to be  much  more  innovative\r\n\r\nhenceforth and come up with revolutionary ideas, which is\r\n\r\npossible  only if they are willing to think  out  of  the\r\n\r\nordinary\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2934</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  long-practised ways of dealing with the business  of\r\n\r\ngoverning  Singapore.   I trust  they  are  looking  into\r\n\r\nvarious  possibilities, as we have a Government  that  is\r\n\r\npragmatic  and  is  a long-term planner.   Citizens  must\r\n\r\nassist  in this regard by giving innovative ideas,  which\r\n\r\nmay  be  idealistic and/or practical.  It is our duty  as\r\n\r\ncitizens  to help our Government to lead it to the  right\r\n\r\npath of progress.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mindset and tactics must, if found necessary and\r\n\r\nessential,  change  in  order  to  survive  well,  to  be\r\n\r\ncompetitive and to create jobs in Singapore.   We  are  a\r\n\r\nsmall  nation geographically and population-wise.  We  do\r\n\r\nnot   have  natural  resources.   There  are  a  lot   of\r\n\r\ndisadvantages in that sense, compared to many nations  in\r\n\r\nASEAN, Asia and the world.  What can we do really?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us think out of the box. Theoretically\r\n\r\nspeaking,  one  could  therefore  ask  whether  being   a\r\n\r\nsovereign  nation called the \"Republic of  Singapore\"  is\r\n\r\nthe  ideal state of affairs in, say, 20 or 30 years.  Can\r\n\r\nwe  survive  as a small nation when ASEAN countries  like\r\n\r\nIndonesia,   Malaysia,  the  Philippines,   Vietnam   and\r\n\r\nThailand  are  forging  ahead  at  a  different  pace  of\r\n\r\neconomic   progress?   They  are  hungry   for   economic\r\n\r\nprogress,  just  as we were hungry in the  1960s  to  the\r\n\r\n1990s,  and  we progressed at a faster pace  during  this\r\n\r\nperiod,  as  we had to survive, which definitely  was  an\r\n\r\nadded and essential impetus to survive as a young nation.\r\n\r\nI am sure we can and will survive as a nation for another\r\n\r\ndecade  or  two comfortably.  However, would we  want  to\r\n\r\nconsider,  and do we have a new vision of joining  forces\r\n\r\npolitically,  geographically and economically  with  some\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries?    Is it possible to work  together  as\r\n\r\nASEAN  neighbours and let us share the  pie  as  a  joint\r\n\r\nventure company of nations?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were once part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965. We\r\n\r\nbecame  a  sovereign republic on 9th August  1965.   What\r\n\r\nwould  we  have been if we had remained in Malaysia?   We\r\n\r\ncan only speculate.  Historians should write about it and\r\n\r\nexplain  to  the  citizenry.  Let us  now  speculate  and\r\n\r\nperhaps give deep analytical thought on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2935</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhaving  Singapore, Malaysia and perhaps even  some  other\r\n\r\nASEAN  countries  merge in some form to create  a  United\r\n\r\nStates  of  South East Asia, if not absolutely,  then  at\r\n\r\nleast  economically, and all of us in ASEAN work together\r\n\r\nand   share  part  of  our  assets,  manpower,  time  and\r\n\r\nexpertise.   It  is like forming a holding  company,  and\r\n\r\neach  participating country being a subsidiary,  and  all\r\n\r\nworking  together in harmony and all reaping the benefits\r\n\r\nof our collective efforts to benefit all as a family.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team effort is what is required to match the premier\r\n\r\nleague players.  Additionally or alternatively, we should\r\n\r\nall put on our thinking caps and consider the possibility\r\n\r\nof  joining,  in  an economic sense, the  premier  league\r\n\r\nplayers  like  China and India.  Our closest relationship\r\n\r\nas  a  nation to nation is of course Malaysia,  and  then\r\n\r\ncomes  perhaps  Indonesia.  At first thought,  everything\r\n\r\nmight seem impossible, what with the history of political\r\n\r\nleadership having had their problems, especially  in  the\r\n\r\n1960s.   However, today's generation of political leaders\r\n\r\nmust  bury  the  old differences, even  if  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  leaders  in  Malaysia, Indonesia  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nmight be related to the older leaders of these countries.\r\n\r\nThe   business   community  and  citizens  of   Malaysia,\r\n\r\nIndonesia and Singapore would, I suspect, want as close a\r\n\r\nrelationship  as  possible, both in terms  of  political,\r\n\r\neconomic  and  family ties.  Would it not  be  important,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  for  the political leaders,  especially  from\r\n\r\nthese  three countries in ASEAN, to work harder and  more\r\n\r\nproductively  towards this goal of merger  as  ASEAN  has\r\n\r\nexisted for more than three decades.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take advantage of the common factors like\r\n\r\nrace,  language and way of life amongst our peoples.   We\r\n\r\nhave Malays, Chinese, Indians and Eurasians, just like in\r\n\r\nMalaysia  and Indonesia, and also in China and India,  as\r\n\r\nfar   as   the  Chinese  and  Indians  respectively   are\r\n\r\nconcerned.   I  know  it  may  be  idealistic  and   even\r\n\r\nunrealistic to think of such a possibility today, but  we\r\n\r\nsow  the seeds of such thoughts in our young leaders  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  explore all avenues to survive,  and  who\r\n\r\nknows\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2936</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat  may come out of this way of thinking for our future\r\n\r\ngenerations  of  citizens, who would be  more  global  in\r\n\r\noutlook  in the years to come.  Mind you, this  does  not\r\n\r\nmean  people who think this way are disloyal but, rather,\r\n\r\nI  believe  it  is the citizens who dare to think  boldly\r\n\r\nthat  would  make  the difference for the  betterment  of\r\n\r\nSingapore in 20 or 30 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to survive for the next few decades, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  open up space - have dual or multi-citizenship,\r\n\r\nand  have  multi-national partners  in  business  and  as\r\n\r\nnations  doing  business,  and  not  just  companies  and\r\n\r\nGovernment-linked companies.  Politicians need to be more\r\n\r\ninnovative, just like company directors have for the last\r\n\r\n30 years or so.  Companies are going global.  Governments\r\n\r\nshould consider at least going regional politically.  The\r\n\r\npolitical  system needs to be relooked and a  new  system\r\n\r\nadopted for discussion at least.  Our Government has done\r\n\r\nwell  for  our citizens and the nation for  the  last  40\r\n\r\nyears.   We need to do much more, and it is going  to  be\r\n\r\nmore  difficult, because the competition is much  keener.\r\n\r\nIt is getting more difficult to grow since we are a first-world  nation, and to maintain that in the midst of  keen\r\n\r\ncompetition is going to be that much tougher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 6 of the Constitution of Singapore states\r\n\r\nthat  there  shall be no surrender of the sovereignty  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as an independent nation unless it is supported\r\n\r\nat  a national referendum by not less than two-thirds  of\r\n\r\nthe citizens who can vote.  Academically speaking, for  a\r\n\r\nstart,  we  may  wish to consider this in  the  long-term\r\n\r\nremaking of Singapore.  If the Government has not thought\r\n\r\nabout it, or has done so but it is of the view that it is\r\n\r\ndefinitely not possible to have such thoughts to come  to\r\n\r\nreality,  I would urge that we get the reasoned paper  on\r\n\r\nwhy  it is not possible in the long term.  I know the CPF\r\n\r\nissue  is in the spotlight, but what I have mentioned  is\r\n\r\nfood  for  thought  to  try and, hopefully,  resolve  our\r\n\r\nlarger  problem of survival economically as a nation.   I\r\n\r\nsuppose  these must, for the time being, be  left  aside,\r\n\r\nbut  I  do sincerely hope that our Government and leaders\r\n\r\nin the business and academic community would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2937</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naddress these issues at some stage in the near future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, let us all unite and come up with cost-effective measures to ensure creation of more jobs and\r\n\r\nsecure reasonable remuneration and contribution into  our\r\n\r\ncitizens'  CPF,  so that all retirement  needs,  payments\r\n\r\nlike housing and medical care, can be met.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, sacrifices must be made by the\r\n\r\nState,   Government   and  civil   service   expenditure,\r\n\r\ncooperation from banks and financial institutions, to  be\r\n\r\nmore compassionate and not to exercise their legal rights\r\n\r\nwithout some care and concern for the plight of citizens.\r\n\r\nThe lifelines to be given by the Government to the poorer\r\n\r\nsectors  of our society who may be most hard-hit  by  the\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts  are  to be welcome.  This is the usual  \"Robin\r\n\r\nHood\" approach of taking - some might call it \"robbing\" - from  the  rich and distributing it to the poor.   It  is\r\n\r\nnoble and should be palatable to Singapore society  as  a\r\n\r\nwhole.   However, the Government should, once in a while,\r\n\r\ntake note of and be caring and compassionate, even if  it\r\n\r\nis  to  be  lip service, to the lower-middle  and  middle\r\n\r\nclass  of  citizens who may be complaining that they  are\r\n\r\noften left out.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land costs, rentals, utilities charges, GST,\r\n\r\nlicensing charges, income tax, property tax, etc, must be\r\n\r\nreviewed and lowered.  Let the State suffer together with\r\n\r\ncitizens.  Let us all share in the financial burden.   My\r\n\r\ncolleagues  in  Parliament have  addressed  these  issues\r\n\r\nseveral times during the last two sittings last week.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board should also consider investing CPF\r\n\r\nmonies  wisely  and grant members better interest  rates.\r\n\r\nMr Lee Han Shih, a freelance journalist, had mentioned in\r\n\r\nhis article in Today on 28th August 2003 that the CPF Act\r\n\r\nshould  be  amended  so  that members  can  enjoy  higher\r\n\r\ninterest rates by allowing computation of interest  on  a\r\n\r\ndaily,  rather than on a monthly basis.  The  CPF  should\r\n\r\nlook into this and explain why it has not done so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I am of the view that cost cutting must\r\n\r\ncover  a  wider  ambit than CPF cost  cutting  alone.   A\r\n\r\nholistic approach\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmust  be  taken to reduce business costs.  However,  this\r\n\r\nmove  to  cut CPF rates at this stage is a good  sign  to\r\n\r\ninvestors to have added confidence to remain here and for\r\n\r\nfresh investors to come to invest in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do support the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\ncall  to  cut  the  CPF  rate in  order  to  create  more\r\n\r\ninvestments in Singapore and more jobs for our citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2938</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the\r\n\r\nOrder  Paper for today be exempted at this day's  sitting\r\n\r\nfrom  the provisions of Standing Order No. 1. -  [Mr  Mah\r\n\r\nBow Tan].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>RETUNING THE CPF</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>5.12 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for the opportunity to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should be applauded for coming out\r\n\r\nwith  a comprehensive and directed dosage of measures  to\r\n\r\nhelp  those  who  are affected by the adjustment  in  CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions,  and  also for the additional  package  to\r\n\r\nassist businesses, particularly the construction, tourism\r\n\r\nand  SMEs.  DPM Lee's announcement, in fact, does address\r\n\r\nmany of the concerns of the people and businesses.  It is\r\n\r\na reflection of our commitment to look after the interest\r\n\r\nof the country and the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures introduced will have very long-term\r\n\r\nbenefits  for  our workers.  Yes, they  have  to  tighten\r\n\r\ntheir  belts  now, relook their financial  planning,  but\r\n\r\ntheir  future will be better secured.  The measures  will\r\n\r\nhelp  the  workers to stand up and proudly move  forward.\r\n\r\nIt  is  our policy to teach and equip a man to catch  his\r\n\r\nown  fish, rather than to give him fish every day and  he\r\n\r\ndoes not know how to fish.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a few concerns on the Work\r\n\r\nAssistance Programme for\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2939</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   unemployed,  and  the  People-for-Jobs  Traineeship\r\n\r\nProgramme  for  older  workers.   Many  do  have   family\r\n\r\nproblems  that come along with unemployment for a  period\r\n\r\nof time, eg, family violence, potential legal proceedings\r\n\r\nfor  traffic  and parking fines, credit cards,  utilities\r\n\r\nbills,  or  even bankruptcy suits.  We need more  than  a\r\n\r\ncase  manager  to  assist the unemployed  and  the  older\r\n\r\nworkers.   We  need  a comprehensive  network  of  social\r\n\r\nservices  to  deal  with  these family  matters.   And  I\r\n\r\nsuggest  that the localised Family Service Centres,  with\r\n\r\nthe  support  of the CDCs, work together  with  the  case\r\n\r\nmanager   to  extend  professional  guidance   to   these\r\n\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, these schemes should also look into\r\n\r\nproviding additional financial schemes during the  period\r\n\r\nof  training.   For  example, get them  involved  in  the\r\n\r\nchild/student  care  financial assistance  scheme,  where\r\n\r\nthey  can  put  their children in the child/student  care\r\n\r\ncentres,  and  parents would be more willing  to  go  for\r\n\r\nskills  upgrading knowing that their children  are  taken\r\n\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the setting up of the Public Transport Funds\r\n\r\nfor   the   lower-income  families,  I  would  urge   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  and NTUC to extend this help to the  marginal\r\n\r\ngroups of families which hover between the low and middle\r\n\r\nincome.   I  have in mind especially the cases where  the\r\n\r\nbreadwinners  are  in the older age group  and  they  are\r\n\r\nhardest  hit by the CPF adjustment.  These families  tend\r\n\r\nto  have  children in the teenage group, where  they  are\r\n\r\nsocially active and need public transport to move around,\r\n\r\nand  many  of  these  families have  also  supported  the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  call to have more than  two  children.   We\r\n\r\nsincerely  hope that the qualifying family  income  level\r\n\r\neligible   for   the   transport   fund   assistance   be\r\n\r\nrealistically  set to readily help those who  need  help,\r\n\r\nrather than by an exception to the prescribed guidelines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Government's help for businesses by extending\r\n\r\nthe statutory lifespan of omnibuses and taxis, may I also\r\n\r\nask the DPM to consider extending the 10-year\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2940</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncap  for  motorcars to 12 years so that  the  man-in-the-street  need not scrap his car within a short  period  of\r\n\r\ntime.   Often, Singaporeans take good care of their  cars\r\n\r\nand   with  improved  technology,  the  cars  are   still\r\n\r\nroadworthy  after 10 years.  It is an argument  that  DPM\r\n\r\nhas  used for the extension of the lifespan of buses  and\r\n\r\ntaxis.   It  is  a waste to have to scrap  the  cars.   A\r\n\r\nchange  in  this 10-year cap will help many  people,  who\r\n\r\nneed  a car for their businesses and work.  This has also\r\n\r\nbeen thoroughly argued by Mr Tan Soo Khoon earlier on the\r\n\r\nhigh cost of owning a car.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly pleased to note that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  is setting up a Cut Waste Panel.   A  lot  of\r\n\r\nMembers  have said why not a No Waste Panel.   I  believe\r\n\r\nthat  the  coverage  extends to  the  civil  service  and\r\n\r\nstatutory  boards.  Government Ministries  and  statutory\r\n\r\nboards  should  not lose sight of their basic  objective,\r\n\r\nthat is, what is their mission.  Their task is to provide\r\n\r\na very noble service, ie, to provide public service at an\r\n\r\neffective cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One arena is the development cost of public offices,\r\n\r\nwhich  includes the buildings, fixtures and  fittings  to\r\n\r\nhouse  the  Government  offices  and  the  other  is  the\r\n\r\noperating  and  running  costs.  \"The  Seven  Wonders  of\r\n\r\nSingapore\" were stated by Mr Tan Soo Khoon in this  House\r\n\r\nbefore  and  we  have  to ask:  can an  efficient  public\r\n\r\nservice be delivered without spending millions of dollars\r\n\r\non  buildings,  fixtures  and fittings  in  the  offices?\r\n\r\nLooking at our Government offices now, many are in first-class  buildings,  with extensive glass curtain  walling,\r\n\r\ngranites  and  marbles,  with  high-grade  fixtures   and\r\n\r\nfittings.  They cost millions of dollars  to  build,  and\r\n\r\nthey  have  to  spend  just as  much  to  maintain  these\r\n\r\ndazzling glasses, marbles and granites.  It is not to say\r\n\r\nthat  Government and its related agencies must always  be\r\n\r\nhoused  in  run-down looking buildings.   By  all  means,\r\n\r\nprogress   and   advance  by  having  modern   Government\r\n\r\nbuildings, but this should not be extravagant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday, while waiting for DPM Lee to arrive\r\n\r\nat Dhoby Ghaut station in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2941</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  NEL  train,  I was marvelling at a five-storey  high\r\n\r\nglass  atrium  and was wondering if the atrium  had  been\r\n\r\nlowered, would it help lower the charges of the NEL fare?\r\n\r\nWe  can have brilliantly sculptured stations, but if they\r\n\r\ncause  transport cost to go up, it would leave  commuters\r\n\r\nwith  a painful souvenir.  Remember also there is a  high\r\n\r\ndepreciation cost for all this infrastructure  which  has\r\n\r\nto be paid annually.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to remember is practicability.\r\n\r\nDoes  it  make  sense?   Look at  the  Corrupt  Practices\r\n\r\nInvestigation  Bureau. It is doing  an  effective  public\r\n\r\nservice  but  it  is humbly housed in a  recycled  school\r\n\r\nbuilding in Cantonment Road.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can these development costs be made more transparent\r\n\r\nfor the public?  I was searching through the HDB's annual\r\n\r\nreports for the current construction cost of HDB flats to\r\n\r\nascertain  a  feedback given to me that the  construction\r\n\r\ncost  of a HDB flat has risen from about $40,000  in  the\r\n\r\n1990s  to  about $80,000 now.  But I could not  ascertain\r\n\r\nthe  cost from the annual reports. These are cost figures\r\n\r\nthat  the Cut Waste Panel should regularly monitor.   HDB\r\n\r\nshould also go back to the drawing board and ask what  is\r\n\r\nits  basic  function.  If its role is  to  provide  good,\r\n\r\nquality public housing, then do so. Do not try to compete\r\n\r\nwith the public sector and incorporate luxury into public\r\n\r\nhousing.  We have just recently debated in this House and\r\n\r\nspent  time  asking why the tempered glass shower  screen\r\n\r\ncracks  but we still have no answer. We cannot  beat  the\r\n\r\nprivate sector, because the prices are different  and  it\r\n\r\nis  also  for a different target market.  Worse, we  give\r\n\r\nluxury  that  is not luxurious, and the new  flat  owners\r\n\r\nhack out what we give and replace them. It is a waste  of\r\n\r\npublic funds.  It only raises the cost of housing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Government department must look into how it has\r\n\r\nto  manage its budget by cutting wastage, job enlargement\r\n\r\nor   simplifying  procedures.    Do  not  look  for  easy\r\n\r\nsolutions,  for example, like closing down  the  swimming\r\n\r\npool  because  you  cannot  cover  overheads,  especially\r\n\r\nduring the SARS epidemic, or argue on the basis\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2942</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  there  was  no  crowd, or intending  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nentrance  fees  for use of sports facilities  because  of\r\n\r\nsmaller  Government grants.  This intention to raise  the\r\n\r\nentrance fees has been passionately argued by Mr  Ong  Ah\r\n\r\nHeng  just now. The questions are:  have you given enough\r\n\r\npublicity before you act?  Did you carry out sufficiently\r\n\r\ngood programmes to attract the crowd?  Maybe, MCDS should\r\n\r\nadopt  Mr Ong Ah Heng's suggestion to co-use the pool  by\r\n\r\nfish and man.  There may be no need for the change of use\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a co-location.  It does  not  mean  that\r\n\r\nbecause  the  swimming pool has been in existence  for  a\r\n\r\nlong  time  and the people are aware of the existence  of\r\n\r\nthe  programmes that they are running.  Passing on  costs\r\n\r\nor  making up for the shortfall in income by reducing the\r\n\r\nservice  and  squeezing the public  is  not  the  way  to\r\n\r\ndeliver  public service.  I sincerely hope that  the  end\r\n\r\nresult  would not also be the ultimate Cut Waste  Panel's\r\n\r\nreview  result  too.   Please  do  not  give  our  people\r\n\r\nadditional pills to swallow for the provision  of  public\r\n\r\nservice, especially in this hard adjustment period.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is good in business and society. We all\r\n\r\nknow that. It is meant to encourage efficiency and keep a\r\n\r\ncheck on prices.  But sometimes competition can also have\r\n\r\nits  bitter  pill.   Take  the  case  of  the  healthcare\r\n\r\nservices  in  Singapore. We have competing  groups,  each\r\n\r\njealously guiding its own turf.  The result is that  each\r\n\r\ngroup  has  to  invest  heavily  on  infrastructure   and\r\n\r\nequipment  when, in fact, it would have been  more  cost-effective if these expensive high-tech equipment could be\r\n\r\ncommonly  shared.   Take,  for example,  if  SGH  has  an\r\n\r\nexpensive specialist equipment, patients who are  in  NUH\r\n\r\ncannot  benefit from it because of the cluster.  So,  NUH\r\n\r\nhas to duplicate SGH and buy its own equipment.  This  is\r\n\r\nanother  area where the Cut Waste Panel could look  into.\r\n\r\nService  in public health must not be allowed  to  suffer\r\n\r\nbecause  of competition.  This feedback is given  by  the\r\n\r\nmedical profession.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is the running of the NEL line.\r\n\r\nYes,  we wanted competition for the operation of the  MRT\r\n\r\nlines.  Has\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2943</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe   competition  brought  in  lower  cost  and   better\r\n\r\ntransport  service for the people?  Where is the  benefit\r\n\r\nof the integration of the bus and MRT lines?  Is there no\r\n\r\nsuch  thing  as affordable fare after we have  privatised\r\n\r\nour  transport  services?   Do  we  need  more  transport\r\n\r\ncompanies  for  competition or should we  revert  to  one\r\n\r\ncompany for the train and another company for the buses?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this review is not under the Cut Waste Panel,\r\n\r\nmaybe  another committee should be set up to review  this\r\n\r\nbasic  infrastructure on competitiveness  of  our  public\r\n\r\nservices   that  are  no  longer  considered   as   state\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the Government on the early release of\r\n\r\ninfrastructure projects to boost the construction sector.\r\n\r\nHowever,  on  productivity, the construction sector  must\r\n\r\nseriously  look  into  how  their  productivity  can   be\r\n\r\nimproved.  Where are they lacking compared with developed\r\n\r\ncountries?   Why?   How can these be improved?   We  have\r\n\r\nalso  seen  some local construction companies going  bust\r\n\r\ndoing  Government infrastructure projects.  Why?  Are  we\r\n\r\nadministering the contract effectively?  Have  our  civil\r\n\r\nservants been too kiasu and added to the latent cost?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very glad that Minister Mah had informed the\r\n\r\nHouse  that  BCA  is  looking at  improving  the  payment\r\n\r\nprocedures to the contractors doing public sector  works,\r\n\r\nincluding the progress payments, the variation orders and\r\n\r\nreviewing   the   withholding  payments  for   liquidated\r\n\r\ndamages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told of this by two contractors\r\n\r\nconsecutively.  A contractor is required to  prepare  for\r\n\r\nat  least  three to four, and sometimes five, inspections\r\n\r\nin the course of handing over a completed HDB project.  I\r\n\r\nunderstand  that the cost to prepare each  inspection  is\r\n\r\nabout  $10,000  and  hence  five  inspections  would   be\r\n\r\n$50,000.  It was argued by one of the grassroots  leaders\r\n\r\nthat  this is the latent cost which is not even  an  open\r\n\r\nGovernment administrative cost.  Another example is  that\r\n\r\none minute scratch, which is not a crack, would require a\r\n\r\nchange of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2944</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhole  piece of glass, regardless of the size.

Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, thank\r\n\r\nyou for allowing me to join in this debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will be pleased to note that after so\r\n\r\nmany  of them have spoken and covered so many points,  my\r\n\r\nspeech  is  now  reduced to a single  point.   Indeed,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  even  claim credit for such a  point  for  it  is\r\n\r\nphased   in   a   discussion  with  some  young   working\r\n\r\nSingaporeans about the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Inderjit Singh earlier spoke on the need to\r\n\r\nmake  the CPF more voluntary, both from the point of view\r\n\r\nof business and employees.  I also want to echo this call\r\n\r\nbut  for  the purpose of encouraging Singaporeans  to  be\r\n\r\nmore independent and responsible for their own future.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of the young people I spoke to were, in\r\n\r\nfact, dismayed at the increase in the Minimum Sum and  at\r\n\r\nthe  abolition of the right to withdraw 50% at 55.   Many\r\n\r\nin  fact  said that they have no interest in what happens\r\n\r\nwhen  they are over 70 or 80.  They see the new rules  as\r\n\r\nGovernment's  kiasuism  and some even  suspect  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  wants to keep their money longer for  reasons\r\n\r\nunknown to them. They argued that if the Government wants\r\n\r\nto  cultivate  an  attitude  of  financial  independence,\r\n\r\nprudence and entrepreneurship amongst young Singaporeans,\r\n\r\nthis is not the way to do it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply, Sir, these young Singaporeans want a\r\n\r\nmore flexible CPF system after the Minimum Sums have been\r\n\r\naccumulated.  No one objects to the principle behind  the\r\n\r\nCPF.  As the Prime Minister\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2945</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsays, it is our only social safety net. Everyone welcomes\r\n\r\nthe  DPM's speech on measures to help needy families tide\r\n\r\nover the problems caused by the cuts.  But what the young\r\n\r\nSingaporean  wants to see is whether he  or  she  can  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the use of his or her money  after  the\r\n\r\nMinimum Sums have been accumulated.  It is suggested that\r\n\r\nonce the Minimum Sums have been reached, an option should\r\n\r\nbe  given to the member to either reduce his contribution\r\n\r\nrate,  withdraw the sums in excess of the  Minimum  Sums,\r\n\r\nwhatever  his age, or to choose not to continue with  the\r\n\r\nCPF contributions altogether.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some already think that the current rule of\r\n\r\nwithdrawing 50% at 55 is too restrictive.  They  see  the\r\n\r\ncurrent uses allowed as far too restrictive. For example,\r\n\r\nit  cannot  be  used  for  starting  a  business  or  for\r\n\r\nretraining themselves or educating their children.  As Mr\r\n\r\nInderjit Singh said, they want more discretion on how  to\r\n\r\nuse their earnings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many young professionals feel this way and I\r\n\r\nthink they deserve an explanation as to why the rules are\r\n\r\nthe  way they are.  Otherwise, as one of them said to me,\r\n\r\n\"Why  stay in Singapore to work where nearly 40% of  your\r\n\r\nsalary  is not within your control?\"  I hope that  as  we\r\n\r\nretune   the  CPF  to  be  more  responsive  to  business\r\n\r\nconditions  worldwide, we will also tune in  to  be  more\r\n\r\nresponsive to members' concerns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the measures introduced to retune the\r\n\r\nCPF.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Sir, for\r\n\r\nallowing me to join in the debate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times of 30th August carried an article\r\n\r\nby investment guru  Dr Marc Faber, also known as Dr Doom.\r\n\r\nThe gist of his views is as follows:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Singapore Government should allow firms to\r\n\r\nfail and set up new sectors;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A more effective move to reduce cost and\r\n\r\nincrease competitiveness would\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2946</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbe  to  move  all manufacturing operations  to  low  cost\r\n\r\ncountries, even at the expense of job losses here;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That it is desirable that wages decline and\r\n\r\nthat  the price levels in Singapore decline, but he feels\r\n\r\nthat the Government should not interfere in the market to\r\n\r\ncut wages;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That Government intervention in wage levels may\r\n\r\nlead  to  unhappiness  and create  an  unfriendly  social\r\n\r\nclimate  to  the extent that it creates a  bigger  divide\r\n\r\nbetween the have and have nots.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the longer-term\r\n\r\napplication of his views.  I am concerned on  his  short-term  do-nothing prescription which may  send  the  wrong\r\n\r\nsignals to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government is responsible for Singaporeans'\r\n\r\nwell-being  and  the  country's  progress  and  has  been\r\n\r\nproactive  in  charting  Singapore's  path  to  recovery,\r\n\r\ncutting   costs   of   doing  business   and   sustaining\r\n\r\nSingapore's competitiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the custodian of a country, if the Government did\r\n\r\nnothing  and allow companies to move away at the  expense\r\n\r\nof  more  and  more job losses and let  nature  take  its\r\n\r\ncourse,  Singaporeans  are  bound  to  doom.   That   the\r\n\r\nGovernment   should  do  nothing  at  all  is  untenable.\r\n\r\nSingapore is a small nation and our cohesiveness  is  our\r\n\r\nstrength.   The Government is right in setting  the  tone\r\n\r\nand  form  for  the longer term perspective  of  our  CPF\r\n\r\nsystem  which  will allow wages and prices to  move  down\r\n\r\nand,  ultimately,  to  allow market forces  to  determine\r\n\r\nfuture wage and price levels.  All these are in line with\r\n\r\nGovernment's  effort to re-make Singapore and  to  lessen\r\n\r\ndirect Government's involvement in the marketplace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am more concerned with Dr Faber's observation\r\n\r\nthat  Government's  intervention in the  wage  debate  is\r\n\r\ncausing unhappiness and social divide.  While this  is  a\r\n\r\nreality not to be taken lightly, I am also happy to  note\r\n\r\nthat Government has always shown compassion and care to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2947</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhelp  the  weak  and  those who  are  badly  affected  by\r\n\r\neconomic circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that wage cuts alone are not enough, but the\r\n\r\nmove  to  retune our CPF is to give the lower income  and\r\n\r\nabove  40 Singaporeans time to sharpen their capabilities\r\n\r\nto ride the global economic landscape.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in the first world, Singapore and Singaporeans\r\n\r\nwill  have to increasingly contend with the challenge  of\r\n\r\ninvestments  going  into  cheaper operating  environment,\r\n\r\njobs  being  lost  to another individual  who  is  better\r\n\r\nequipped  and  can offer value add contributions  at  the\r\n\r\nsame or cheaper wage cost.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in such a flux that the Government has to put\r\n\r\nin  place  the path finding process that will  ultimately\r\n\r\ngive  us the right strategies and formula to continue  to\r\n\r\ncompete and sustain our economy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Dr Faber's recommendation that Government\r\n\r\nshould stay out and not interfere with the wage situation\r\n\r\nreminds  me  of  an  article that  I  came  across.   The\r\n\r\narticle,  written by Adam Cohen, is entitled  \"When  life\r\n\r\noffers  a  choice between the White Wall  and  the  Brick\r\n\r\nWall\".  The story goes this way:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bartleby, the scrivener, is asked by his boss\r\n\r\nto  help with some law-office drudgery, Bartleby says, \"I\r\n\r\nwould prefer not to.\"  Despite his employer's attempts to\r\n\r\nchange  his  mind, and to learn his reasons  for  turning\r\n\r\ndown assignments, Bartleby never says much more.  \"Why do\r\n\r\nyou  refuse?\"  his boss asks.  \"I would prefer  not  to,\"\r\n\r\nBartleby replies placidly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melville wrote Bartleby, the Scrivener 150 years\r\n\r\nago.   This  novel  has  what all great  literature  has:\r\n\r\ntimelessness, and a depth that allows readers to find new\r\n\r\nthings when they come back to it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Adam Cohen first read Bartleby, with the 1960's\r\n\r\nfaintly  lingering  in  the  air,  it  struck  him  as  a\r\n\r\nmeditation   on   freedom,  against   oppressive   social\r\n\r\nstructures.  But\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2948</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nre-reading  it  now, in a world full of bad  options,  it\r\n\r\nfeels like a cautionary tale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartleby's approach to life is pure, but untenable:\r\n\r\nsimply because, even when our choices are bleak, we  have\r\n\r\na duty to make the best ones we can.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grim options offered by Bartleby's office begin\r\n\r\nwith the views: a white wall \"deficient in what landscape\r\n\r\npainters  call 'life'\", and \"a brick wall that offers  at\r\n\r\nleast, a contrast, if nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His job of scrivener, since made obsolete by the\r\n\r\nXerox  machine, involves copying legal documents by hand.\r\n\r\nWhen  he is not duplicating other people's words, he  and\r\n\r\nhis  fellow scriveners are reading their copies  back  to\r\n\r\none another to check for errors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Bartleby's stodgy boss concedes that it is\r\n\r\n\"very dull, wearisome, and lethargic\" work that to people\r\n\r\nwith   \"sanguine   temperaments\"  might  be   \"altogether\r\n\r\nintolerable.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, Bartleby completes his assignments\r\n\r\nenergetically.  But before long, when his boss  asks  for\r\n\r\nhelp  with a small legal document, Bartleby responds with\r\n\r\nthe  phrase that will become his mantra,  \"I would prefer\r\n\r\nnot  to.\" Before long, he refuses to leave the office  at\r\n\r\nall,  and  starts to make it his home.  Rather than  fire\r\n\r\nhis  recalcitrant  employee, the  boss  keeps  trying  to\r\n\r\npersuade him to get to work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, the boss moves his law firm out of the\r\n\r\noffices that Bartleby haunts day and night.  When  a  new\r\n\r\nlawyer moves in, Bartleby is taken away to the Tombs, New\r\n\r\nYork's aptly named prison.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartleby continues his calm resistance there by\r\n\r\nrefusing the food.  \"I prefer not to dine,\" he tells  the\r\n\r\ncook.  His passivity eventually kills him.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the story of Bartleby truly reflects the\r\n\r\nessence  of our times.  In this globalised economy  where\r\n\r\nchange  is  the  only  certainty,  Singaporeans  must  be\r\n\r\nresponsive and be flexible, as that is the only  path  to\r\n\r\nsurvival.  To remain apathetic and do\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2949</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnothing, as Bartleby did and as Dr Doom prescribed, would\r\n\r\nbe  like  the  contented  frog  who  dozed  off  and  was\r\n\r\neventually boiled to death, that DPM Lee spoke about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this impending change and high unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation,  Singaporeans  and Singaporean  companies  can\r\n\r\neither do nothing or make good of the opportunities  that\r\n\r\nthe Government is offering on a platter.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In today's world of bleak alternatives, Bartleby's\r\n\r\nstory  is a sobering reminder that what life requires  is\r\n\r\nremaining  engaged, ie, preferring and  acting  on  those\r\n\r\npreferences.  Contemplating Bartleby's sad end  may  give\r\n\r\nus  some strength, as we continue to stand up for painful\r\n\r\npolicy  options  and settle for long-term  victories  and\r\n\r\nvote for the lesser of the two, or more, pains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this light that proactive organisations\r\n\r\ntook upon themselves to engage in the developments around\r\n\r\nus.   Therefore, the likes of SIA and many others carried\r\n\r\nout  a review of their operations to better sharpen their\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,   and  the  review   was   premised   on\r\n\r\nrestructuring  for  relevance and  performance.   In  the\r\n\r\nprocess,  redundancy arose.  However,  every  effort  was\r\n\r\nmade to compensate and reskill the excess employees to be\r\n\r\nemployable again.  This, I know, was well managed by  SIA\r\n\r\nand the likes of HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to share that, generally, the state of\r\n\r\nhuman  resource  and  industrial  relation  practices  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is above global average index.  If IR  and  HR\r\n\r\npractices are deemed responsible for the stories we hear,\r\n\r\nit  is because the story is often told half truth, or  is\r\n\r\nhalf told.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I ask to be excused for my impertinence to cite\r\n\r\nthis example as an illustration.  If I were to say that I\r\n\r\nsaw  Mayor  Heng Chee How at Desker Road last  night,  it\r\n\r\ntells  one story.  But if I were to go on to say that  he\r\n\r\nwas  at  Desker Road last night carrying out his duty  as\r\n\r\nMayor  of Central CDC where Jalan Besar happens  to  fall\r\n\r\nunder, and he was there to check out on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2950</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncertain  complaints, it tells another story.  So,  it  is\r\n\r\nimportant to tell the whole truth.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our vision is to create a future where\r\n\r\nSingapore,  embedding the physical, intellectual,  social\r\n\r\nand spiritual spheres, continues to remain attractive  to\r\n\r\nstakeholders.  These stakeholders include the  investors,\r\n\r\ntalents, both local and foreign, as well as the  old  and\r\n\r\nthe   young  in  this  multi-religious  and  multi-racial\r\n\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's tenacious job is the ability to\r\n\r\nbalance  the  Chinese weighing scale.  Pull it  one  side\r\n\r\nhigher  and tip down the other side, you upset  those  on\r\n\r\nthe bottom of the scale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this whole debate of making it affordable for\r\n\r\nbusinesses    and    possible   for    the    Singaporean\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  the  Government has  shown  its  astute\r\n\r\ncapability  of striking a balance and, more  importantly,\r\n\r\nits compassion and humane touch.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The announcement by DPM Lee of the other cost saving\r\n\r\nmeasures   that  the  Government  will  embark   on,   in\r\n\r\nparticular,  cost of doing business with the  Government,\r\n\r\nhas   reinforced  the  gotong-royong  spirit   that   all\r\n\r\nstakeholders must possess.  He has also driven  home  the\r\n\r\nmessage that it is through thick and thin that we will go\r\n\r\nthrough  together as a team.  And I agree  here  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  extend beyond pre-emptive lay-off to  pre-emptive\r\n\r\nmotivation that DPM Tony Tan spoke about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sir, I would like to make some\r\n\r\nobservations  with  regard to the CPF  retuning  and  the\r\n\r\nrelief  package and urge the Government to  do  more  for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, especially the PMETs.  Sir,  I  have  asked\r\n\r\nfor  permission  to distribute a table to  illustrate  my\r\n\r\npoint.  [Copies of Table distributed to hon. Members.]\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh spoke of the PMETs who constitute\r\n\r\n43%  of  the retrenched employees.  They seem to  be  the\r\n\r\nmore  vulnerable group and, for the above 40s, they  also\r\n\r\ntake a longer time to be re-employed.  By and large,  the\r\n\r\nabove  40s  PMETs are the ones who would  be  financially\r\n\r\nsqueezed  with prospect of no or lesser CPF contributions\r\n\r\nto service their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2951</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmortgages  and other mid-life commitments.  The  retuning\r\n\r\nexercise  will hit this group most drastically and  hence\r\n\r\nthey are deserving of help.  The illustration that ensues\r\n\r\nexplains clearly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a person aged above 50 but below 55 now, the\r\n\r\neffective  CPF  cut is 3% per year over  the  next  three\r\n\r\nyears.  However, a person who is 48 years old now and  on\r\n\r\nreaching  the  age of 51, will see a 6%  cut  in  CPF  on\r\n\r\nreaching  51  years of age.  Sir, this group  at  48  and\r\n\r\nbelow will face a double whammy when they reach age 51.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has put in place various relief\r\n\r\npackages  and  assistance schemes for  the  lower  income\r\n\r\ngroups.   It demonstrates PM Goh's and DPM Lee's promises\r\n\r\nto  assist every Singaporean affected by this major  wage\r\n\r\nrestructuring process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about Singaporeans from the professionals,\r\n\r\nmanagers,  executives and technical  group  (PMETs)  with\r\n\r\nsalary  ranging from $3,000 to $6,000?  This  cohort  has\r\n\r\nbeen  growing since the shift in our economy  to  a  more\r\n\r\nknowledge-based  one.  The feedback  from  many  in  this\r\n\r\ngroup  is,  \"Why  are we always left out?   Many  of  the\r\n\r\nschemes are targeted at the lower income groups.  We  are\r\n\r\nthe new poor Singaporeans.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From experience, we know that this group is capable\r\n\r\nof  making short-term lifestyle adjustments according  to\r\n\r\ntheir  individual  financial  circumstances.   They  have\r\n\r\nmanaged  and weathered well in the past financial  crisis\r\n\r\nwithout  much  help, living largely from  their  savings.\r\n\r\nThis   time  the  circumstances  surrounding   them   are\r\n\r\ndifferent.  Like all other major economies in the  world,\r\n\r\njobs are lost to comparatively lower cost countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that professionals, managers, executives,\r\n\r\neven  businessmen and the self-employed  should  be  more\r\n\r\ncapable  of  taking care of themselves.  Nonetheless,  we\r\n\r\nhave  to take cognisance of this difference from previous\r\n\r\ndownturns   this   time   round.    What   recourse    do\r\n\r\nprofessionals,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2952</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmanagers, executives, businessmen and self-employed  have\r\n\r\nbesides seeing their MPs to pour out their predicament?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the relief package is clear on schemes such as\r\n\r\nWAP  to  assist the lower income group but silent on  its\r\n\r\neligibility  for  PMETs in similar plight  as  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome  group. The PMETs, mostly in their  40s  and  50s,\r\n\r\nconstitute  a  substantial segment of the workforce,  and\r\n\r\nthe  remote chance of reemployment in the next  6  to  12\r\n\r\nmonths  spell anxiety and despair for many  of  them.   I\r\n\r\nurge  the  Government to spare them  a  second  look  and\r\n\r\nspecify  how  they  can be helped and consider  extending\r\n\r\nassistance schemes to the more deserving ones.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also urge for more assistance to be extended to\r\n\r\nnot-for-profit outfits, like SPEC, that was the first  to\r\n\r\nchampion  the  cause of PMEBS when it  first  encountered\r\n\r\nsymptoms  of  their  challenges and plights.   SPEC  had,\r\n\r\nsince   1997,   been   engaged   in   facilitating    the\r\n\r\nemployability  and  addressing  the  concerns  of  PMEBS,\r\n\r\ntogether with MOM.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the several schemes announced by DPM Lee, there\r\n\r\nis only one that has direct bearing on PMETs, and that is\r\n\r\nthe   People-for-Jobs  Traineeship  Programme.   For  the\r\n\r\nothers, it is unclear how PMETs can benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another scheme that throws hope for the PMEBS\r\n\r\nis  the  $90  million International Enterprise  Incentive\r\n\r\nScheme  to  help  Singaporean businesses venture  abroad.\r\n\r\nThese  businesses  would need expertise  and  experienced\r\n\r\nPMEBS.   I would like to urge the SMEs, together with  IE\r\n\r\nSingapore and the SWDA, to explore jointly setting  up  a\r\n\r\nscheme to encourage and facilitate the employment of  the\r\n\r\nunemployed PMEBS in these operations overseas or locally.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the SMEs, I understand that many of our GLCs\r\n\r\nare  also  considering investments in overseas operations\r\n\r\nand  I  urge  that they too would draw  on  the  pool  of\r\n\r\nunemployed PMETs for their overseas operations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2953</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this scheme could be like the Training for\r\n\r\nEmployment Scheme (TFES).  As it stands, TFES  is  silent\r\n\r\non  its  applicability  to convert unemployed  PMEBS  for\r\n\r\nexpert contribution and gainful employment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been told that CareerLink at SPEC has a\r\n\r\ndatabase of some 5,000 PMETs registered, looking for  job\r\n\r\nopportunities, and this could be the starting  point  for\r\n\r\nSMEs  and  GLCs to offer jobs and tap on their  expertise\r\n\r\nand   experience.    An   important   consideration    is\r\n\r\nstreamlining and integrating job creation and  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities with the relief package and  needs  of  the\r\n\r\nSMEs respectively, as well as that of the GLCs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the impact of a double-whammy CPF cut for\r\n\r\nthose  who  reach  51,  gainfully  employed  PMETs,  with\r\n\r\noutstanding  mortgage  loans, could  be  sitting  on  two\r\n\r\npotentially possible financial time-bombs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first potential financial time-bomb is their job\r\n\r\nsecurity  and  pay  package.  If ever  retrenched,  these\r\n\r\nPMETs  face the prospect of being unemployed with no  pay\r\n\r\nor  re-employed at a lower pay. When that happens,  their\r\n\r\nability  to  service  their  mortgage  and  other  family\r\n\r\ncommitments  would  be further eroded.   No  doubt,  Sir,\r\n\r\nMinister Mah Bow Tan has assured that assistance  schemes\r\n\r\nare  available from HDB for mortgagors, but the  fact  is\r\n\r\nthat the financial ability of these PMETs is eroded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second financial time-bomb is the prospect of\r\n\r\nfuture increase in mortgage rates.  Interest rates are at\r\n\r\ntheir  all-time low and the prospect of increase is real.\r\n\r\nThose vulnerable to an increase in mortgage rate would be\r\n\r\nthose who have maximum financial commitment to a mortgage\r\n\r\nloan  based on the current low mortgage rate and  are  at\r\n\r\ntheir best ability to service the loan.  The illustration\r\n\r\nthat follows clarifies this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, for every 1% increase in mortgage rate,\r\n\r\nthe home owners who take a 25-year $360,000 mortgage loan\r\n\r\nwould have to incur an additional monthly cash payment of\r\n\r\nabout $200 in interest payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2954</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there may be nothing much that HDB could do\r\n\r\nhere  except  again  to  further  extend  its  assistance\r\n\r\nscheme.   Sir, from these two illustrations, we recognise\r\n\r\nthat  the financial plight of the PMETs cannot be glossed\r\n\r\nover.   Their financial burden would require a bit  of  a\r\n\r\nlifting  by extending the scope of some of the assistance\r\n\r\nschemes to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government's relief package on accelerating\r\n\r\nthe  infrastructure projects to the tune of $600  million\r\n\r\nis  the  largest  item of the $1 billion package.   Would\r\n\r\nthis  translate into jobs and more business opportunities\r\n\r\nfor   Singaporeans?   How  can  the  Government  and  the\r\n\r\nrelevant agencies ensure that unemployed Singaporeans are\r\n\r\ntargeted at?  I am encouraged by Minister Mah's assurance\r\n\r\nthat  many  of  the projects would be eligible  to  local\r\n\r\ncontractors based on the scale of the projects.  I  would\r\n\r\nalso  urge  that  for  the bigger  scale  projects  where\r\n\r\nforeign  contractors'  expertise is  necessary,  then  we\r\n\r\nshould  facilitate  a  local partnership  so  that  local\r\n\r\npartners will continue to have a place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it would be beneficial to put in place a\r\n\r\ntracking of the numbers and types of jobs created and  of\r\n\r\nthe numbers of unemployed Singaporeans taking up the jobs\r\n\r\nand  the issues encountered in the process.  This  should\r\n\r\nsimilarly  be  done  for the tourism industry  where  the\r\n\r\nGovernment will be pumping in $100 million in the Tourism\r\n\r\nRecovery Fund.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are indeed encouraged by PM's compassion and\r\n\r\nunderstanding  of  the need to restore  the  cut  CPF  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  during better times.  This is important  as\r\n\r\nwe must never look at this round's CPF cut as a permanent\r\n\r\ncut.   Singaporeans have already accepted the  fact  that\r\n\r\ngoing  back  to  the  40% contribution  rate,  which  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  supported in the  past,  is  a  foregone\r\n\r\nconclusion.    We   have,   in   our   midst,   realistic\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  who are flexible and prepared to  sacrifice\r\n\r\nfor   the  long  term  good  of  the  country  and   cost\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness of the economy.  Giving up  the  40%  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution is a gesture of sacrifice on the part of the\r\n\r\nemployees.  Keeping to its promise to restore CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2955</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto 36%, when in prosperous times, is a commitment that we\r\n\r\nmust not fail our Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk that there is no longer\r\n\r\ntrust  and loyalty in organisations today with the  shift\r\n\r\nto bottom-line driven objectives.  I would argue that the\r\n\r\npursuit of such commercial objectives does not mean doing\r\n\r\naway with loyalty and trust.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am heartened by what DPM Tony Tan has said,\r\n\r\nas  reported  in  the newspapers, that  we  should  start\r\n\r\nlooking at companies like Walmart whose corporate culture\r\n\r\nhas  bred  trust  and  loyalty.  As MOS  Cedric  Foo  has\r\n\r\nreinforced, productivity and preparedness of employers to\r\n\r\nreview  their  operations  through  work  redesign   will\r\n\r\nfacilitate  value-add  contributions  of  employees,  and\r\n\r\nconvince employers to look at their employees as an asset\r\n\r\nand not as a cost of doing business.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, man sacrifices for his belief when he can see\r\n\r\nand   experience  the  trust  and  loyalty.    On   these\r\n\r\nfundamentals,  in  the  last  38  years,  our   political\r\n\r\nleadership has nurtured a nation that is imbued with  the\r\n\r\nmotivation to overcome challenges and set ourselves ahead\r\n\r\nin every competition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore spirit has pulled us through\r\n\r\nseveral  crises in the last 38 years and  we  have  found\r\n\r\nthat  the formula was going through thick and thin  as  a\r\n\r\nteam.   I  believe Singaporeans will have the resolve  to\r\n\r\nsupport    the   Government's   move   to   regain    our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness  through  this  same  formula  of   going\r\n\r\nthrough thick and thin as a team.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trimming the CPF waistline down from 36% is a\r\n\r\nhealthy  exercise.   And, on this  note,  I  support  the\r\n\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, last week, my\r\n\r\nhonourable  colleague, Mr Nithiah Nandan,  spoke  of  his\r\n\r\nmeeting with union members to discuss proposed changes to\r\n\r\nCPF.   I  too was at that meeting.  There was  a  general\r\n\r\nconsensus at the meeting that we need to retune  our  CPF\r\n\r\nin\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2956</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\norder  to  enhance our competitiveness and to ensure  the\r\n\r\ncontinuing survival of our country.  I need not say  that\r\n\r\nthe  prospect  of further cuts in our CPF was  no  morale\r\n\r\nbooster  for the workers and, in fact, after a string  of\r\n\r\nbad  news  over the last six months relating to corporate\r\n\r\nrestructuring, the weak economy, SARS and Iraqi war,  the\r\n\r\nproposed changes to the CPF have been seen as yet another\r\n\r\nblow in the stomach.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, like all good citizens, the workers\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  need  for  these  changes  in  order  to\r\n\r\npreserve jobs and to keep the economy going.  I can  feel\r\n\r\nthe  concerns of the workers at a time like this.   There\r\n\r\nis  much uncertainty which hangs around them as there  is\r\n\r\nno  guarantee  that reducing CPF contribution  by  3%  is\r\n\r\ngoing to assure them their jobs and future employment.  I\r\n\r\nam glad, however, to learn of last week's announcement by\r\n\r\nDPM  Lee  of  the  package of measures  to  mitigate  the\r\n\r\nharshness  of the proposed reduction to the rate  of  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution.  Any form of relief will always be welcomed\r\n\r\nat this time and will certainly be appreciated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have always spoken of the need to bond with\r\n\r\nthe  workers  in  order  to ensure their  commitment  and\r\n\r\nloyalty.   This need to bond with the workers is perhaps,\r\n\r\nin  part, a reflection of a broader need on our desire to\r\n\r\nwant to bond the people to the country.  Whether you like\r\n\r\nit or not, a reduction in the salary, a restructuring, or\r\n\r\na   retrenchment   exercise  is  always  an   emotionally\r\n\r\ntraumatic experience for the workers.  If you believe, as\r\n\r\nsome companies do, in the principle that the employees of\r\n\r\nany  organisation are the most important assets, then how\r\n\r\nyou manage the process of bonding with the people will be\r\n\r\ncritical to the outcome of the organisation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the truth of the matter is that even in this\r\n\r\neconomic  climate, not all companies are equally affected\r\n\r\nby weak economic conditions.  Some have been able to ride\r\n\r\nthrough  this tough time better than others and have,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  out-performed themselves in the past.   For  these\r\n\r\ncompanies, I hope that they would not use the  excuse  of\r\n\r\nthe present CPF restructuring exercise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2957</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto increase their profitability further at the expense of\r\n\r\nthe  workers.  Such measures are opportunistic and  I  am\r\n\r\nsure will be made obvious to the employees in no time.  I\r\n\r\ncertainly  hope that the employers in this category  will\r\n\r\nfind a way of ploughing back the savings from the CPF  to\r\n\r\nthe employees for their benefit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is another category of\r\n\r\nemployers  who  are  genuinely suffering.   Although  the\r\n\r\nreduction  in CPF contribution cuts across the board  for\r\n\r\nall  employees who are CPF account holders, the  question\r\n\r\nwhich  we  have to address is whether or not  more  could\r\n\r\nhave  been  done by way of cost reduction to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthat pain is fairly borne by all.  Let me explain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the very high income earners, cutting the CPF by\r\n\r\n6% does not matter very much as compared to one who, say,\r\n\r\nearns  $1,000 a month.  Our present rule does not require\r\n\r\nanyone  to  contribute  that part of  the  salary  beyond\r\n\r\n$6,000  into the CPF account.  So if your pay is $30,000,\r\n\r\nyour  CPF  take-home will be $960 from your employer  and\r\n\r\nwith a cut of 10%, it will be just $600.  What difference\r\n\r\nis  this  $360 to someone who is looking at about $28,000\r\n\r\ncash flow a month.  But for a worker who earns  $1,000, a\r\n\r\n6%  cut will be quite substantial indeed in terms of cash\r\n\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I do not expect any regulatory intervention to\r\n\r\nlower the salary of these high income earners, it will be\r\n\r\ngood if companies and managers can take a serious view of\r\n\r\ntheir own salaries and are prepared to voluntarily take a\r\n\r\ndeeper  cut in order to sustain viability of the  company\r\n\r\nand  also the employment of others.  At a time like this,\r\n\r\nif  the  workers  can  perceive that their  managers  are\r\n\r\nprepared  to bite the bullet with them, and to  take  the\r\n\r\ntough  journey  together, then I am very sure  the  bonds\r\n\r\nbetween the managers, the owners and the workers will  be\r\n\r\nbetter  established  and this will  augur  well  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany in the longer term.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has spoken of the need to\r\n\r\nrestructure to face the demands\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2958</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  the changing times.  While I can understand the  need\r\n\r\nto   reorganise   to   help   companies   improve   their\r\n\r\nprofitability, there is a question which  remains  as  to\r\n\r\nwhether  or not this is a good time to reorganise  public\r\n\r\nagencies  that are not similarly motivated  by  the  same\r\n\r\nconcerns of profitability.  The workers can understand if\r\n\r\nMotorola  and Seagate have to lay-off workers  to  remain\r\n\r\ncompetitive  and profitable.  But, at a time  like  this,\r\n\r\nwhen jobs are so scarce, one questions whether or not  it\r\n\r\nis appropriate now to trim the size of public agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one hand, we hear the cry of Government for more\r\n\r\njobs to be created in Singapore for the workers, yet,  on\r\n\r\nthe other hand, I am given to understand that many public\r\n\r\nsector   jobs  are  being  made  redundant   because   of\r\n\r\noutsourcing.   We have a contradiction on  hand  here,  a\r\n\r\nsituation of the Government calling for more jobs  to  be\r\n\r\ncreated  and yet, at the same time, have many  Government\r\n\r\nagencies outsourcing many of the job functions to others.\r\n\r\nThis  is  not a problem if these outsourced  jobs  go  to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans but, unfortunately, many of these outsourced\r\n\r\njobs go to foreigners in the process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case you get me wrong, I am not against the\r\n\r\nprinciple of hiring foreigners who can contribute to this\r\n\r\ncountry.   What  I  am saying is the timing  judgment  by\r\n\r\nthese non-profit oriented public sector organisations  to\r\n\r\nundertake restructuring exercise presently, knowing  full\r\n\r\nwell  how  scarce jobs can be particularly for those  who\r\n\r\nare in the middle age group.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that these middle-age workers are\r\n\r\nthe ones who carried the economy on their backs at a time\r\n\r\nwhen  we were industrialising and trying to build up this\r\n\r\ncountry.   It  is to them that we owe our  gratitude  and\r\n\r\nthese  are  the people whom we must not abandon  in  this\r\n\r\nhour of need.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would, therefore, urge the Government that, if\r\n\r\nthey   are   thinking  of  further  downsizing  involving\r\n\r\nredundancies or outsourcing, such plans be  put  on  hold\r\n\r\nuntil such time when the economy and employment situation\r\n\r\nhave significantly improved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2959</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Prime Minister's\r\n\r\nstatement  enunciating  the Government's  policy  on  CPF\r\n\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  many  Singaporeans are indeed relieved  by  the\r\n\r\nlight  touch the Prime Minister has applied  to  the  CPF\r\n\r\nretuning and also generally pleased with the good dose of\r\n\r\npain  reliever prescribed by DPM Lee.  It seems that  the\r\n\r\nCabinet  has  taken note of the anxieties at  the  ground\r\n\r\nwhen  the subject of CPF retuning was first broached  and\r\n\r\noffered  a  finely balanced policy package.   While  some\r\n\r\nanalysts  have expressed disappointment that the  changes\r\n\r\ndo  not  go far enough to cut costs and bring in  or,  at\r\n\r\nleast, retain investments and jobs, the social dimensions\r\n\r\nof the CPF retuning must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on the details of the CPF changes\r\n\r\nand the aid package, I would like to comment more broadly\r\n\r\non  our  wage  cost.   After all, an  uncompetitive  wage\r\n\r\nstructure  has been identified by the Government  as  the\r\n\r\nkey reason for the current changes to the CPF system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, complaints by local and\r\n\r\nforeign  businesses of our high cost  of  doing  business\r\n\r\nhave  been bandied around for some time now.  As DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nreminded us, back in 1985, CPF rates were seen as one  of\r\n\r\nthe  main  culprits  for our economic  predicament  then.\r\n\r\nEighteen years on, the Government has again named it as a\r\n\r\nmajor source of our economic woes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM Tan recently brought to attention a PERC report\r\n\r\ndated  2nd  July  2003 on \"Comparing  Business  Costs  in\r\n\r\nAsia\".   In  this report, Singapore is not only perceived\r\n\r\nto  rank as the fourth highest labour cost country  among\r\n\r\nthe  expatriates surveyed, its labour cost is also  rated\r\n\r\nhigher  than  those of Australia and  US,  which  is  the\r\n\r\nlargest and strongest economy in the world.  To quote DPM\r\n\r\nTan, \". When according to PERC's calculations, it is more\r\n\r\nexpensive  to hire a worker in Singapore as  compared  to\r\n\r\nhiring a similar\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2960</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworker  in the US, or Australia, we have a major economic\r\n\r\nproblem.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given PERC's high standing in international circles,\r\n\r\nI  have  no reason to doubt that their conclusions  would\r\n\r\nlikely  bear  up to MOM's scrutiny.  But, for  this  very\r\n\r\nreason,  Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am deeply troubled  by\r\n\r\nthis  latest revelation.  This is so even though Minister\r\n\r\nLim  Boon Heng has clarified in his speech on 29th August\r\n\r\nthat,   according  to  the  IMD's  World  Competitiveness\r\n\r\nYearbook  2003,  it is in specific managerial,  executive\r\n\r\nand  professional jobs in engineering and human resource,\r\n\r\netc,  and  not manufacturing itself where the Singaporean\r\n\r\nworker's wages are comparable to first world levels,  but\r\n\r\nwithout the corresponding levels of productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question troubling me, and I am sure many\r\n\r\nothers,  is: does the Government not keep close track  of\r\n\r\nour   labour  costs  in  comparison  with  those  of  our\r\n\r\ninternational competitors in order to ensure that  we  do\r\n\r\nnot price ourselves out of the market?  To reiterate, was\r\n\r\nnot  high  labour  cost one of the chief  causes  of  our\r\n\r\nrecession in 1985/1986?  To quote Prime Minister  Goh  in\r\n\r\n1986,  when  he was then First Deputy Prime Minister,  he\r\n\r\nhad  said  during the debate on the Presidential  Address\r\n\r\nregarding  a  cut in the CPF contribution  that  \".  When\r\n\r\nconfronted with the sobering thought that our wage  costs\r\n\r\nare  so  high that we are going to lose our international\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness,  we  have no  choice  but  to  thaw  our\r\n\r\nposition.\"   The position then DPM Goh was referring  was\r\n\r\nthe  sacred cow of our high CPF contribution rates.  Sir,\r\n\r\nhistory seems to have come one full circle.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it that we have now, 18 years later, come to\r\n\r\nthis  belated  conclusion that CPF is  the  same  culprit\r\n\r\ncausing  mischief, so much so that we need again to  take\r\n\r\nsuch  drastic  measures  as to cut  CPF  rates?   Sir,  I\r\n\r\nappreciate  DPM  Lee's  explanation  as  to  how   events\r\n\r\nunfolded  so quickly and unexpectedly that the Government\r\n\r\nhad  to agonise over the decision for two months, and led\r\n\r\nto  a  major  rethink.  Nonetheless, Sir, I believe  that\r\n\r\nwages  and  wage levels do not change overnight  and  the\r\n\r\nlevels\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2961</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  are  at  today  not only reflect  the  good  economic\r\n\r\nconditions  of  the  past but also  the  consequences  of\r\n\r\nprevious actions and policies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I and, no doubt, many other Singaporeans would\r\n\r\nlike to know how the Government keeps track or intends to\r\n\r\nkeep  track  of Singapore's labour costs to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nthese are not out of sync with our competitors.  Does not\r\n\r\nthe  National  Wages Council also have such  information?\r\n\r\nHow else would it make recommendations about wages if the\r\n\r\nCouncil  does not have access to such information?   This\r\n\r\nis  especially important in Singapore as, over the years,\r\n\r\nthe  pervasive  civil service and statutory  boards'  pay\r\n\r\nstructure has become the barometer of wage levels for the\r\n\r\nprivate  sector.  The private sector has to compete  with\r\n\r\nthe  public sector for employees and can only attract the\r\n\r\nbest talent, all else being equal, if they pay comparable\r\n\r\nsalaries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, Sir, I urge the Government to keep a\r\n\r\nclose  watch  on our wage and other costs to ensure  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  remains competitive, if this  is  not  already\r\n\r\nbeing   done.    Better  still,  MOM  can  publish   this\r\n\r\ninformation  for our workers at different levels  and  in\r\n\r\nkey  sectors (as some HR and recruitment agencies do  and\r\n\r\nas  what  MOH plans to do for health costs) so that  they\r\n\r\nare  aware  of  how we fare against the competition.   In\r\n\r\nsupplying  such information periodically,  MOM  would  be\r\n\r\nable   to  moderate  the  unions'  and  workers'   salary\r\n\r\nexpectations.  We can then avoid having to jam our brakes\r\n\r\nsuddenly  again  in  future and throw everyone  else  off\r\n\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will comment briefly on three points related\r\n\r\nto  implications  and  concerns of CPF  changes  and  the\r\n\r\nrelief  package.  Firstly, the floating CPF rate.   Using\r\n\r\nthe CPF as a macro-economic cost cutting tool is not new,\r\n\r\nas  this  was  first done in the 1985/1986 recession  and\r\n\r\nthen,  again,  in 1999.  What is different this  time  is\r\n\r\nthat  the Government has decided that the CPF rate  would\r\n\r\nbe a range, instead of a single target rate.  Although it\r\n\r\ngives rise to uncertainties, I concur that this is a\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2962</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngood strategy as it gives more flexibility to our overall\r\n\r\nwage  system.  After all, the mantra for success in  this\r\n\r\nera   of   shifting  global  competition,  fraught   with\r\n\r\nuncertainties, must be \"Flexibility, Flexibility and more\r\n\r\nFlexibility\"  -  agility and deftness to  adjust  to  the\r\n\r\nrapidly changing circumstances.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, analysts, economists and businessmen\r\n\r\nhave  commented that the CPF rate cuts lagged behind  the\r\n\r\nbroader  economy.  For instance, by the time the CPF  cut\r\n\r\nwas  implemented in 1986, the US economy was  already  in\r\n\r\nrecovery  mode.   This again happened in 1999.   Analysts\r\n\r\nnoted  that  the market recovery had already started  way\r\n\r\nbefore  the CPF cut was announced in 1998.  Of course,  I\r\n\r\nbelieve  that the Government should never rush into  such\r\n\r\nchanges, given the many and complex linkages between  CPF\r\n\r\nand  the  major  social  needs of  the  population,  like\r\n\r\nhousing,  healthcare and retirement.  Any tinkering  will\r\n\r\r\nhave  ramifications on all of these, in ways  we  may  be\r\n\r\nunable to foresee.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But notwithstanding this, it is vital that future\r\n\r\nadjustments, which PM has noted, will only be  made  when\r\n\r\nnecessary, should be made as timely as possible,  and  in\r\n\r\nthis  regard,  inputs from the private  sector,  who  are\r\n\r\ncloser  to  the  ground,  would  be  helpful.   Like   my\r\n\r\nparliamentary colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh,  I  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to pay heed to private sector feedback and not\r\n\r\ndo so only when a crisis occurs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in view of this, I would propose that the\r\n\r\nGovernment  look  at  having a  panel  comprising  mostly\r\n\r\nprivate  sector businessmen and economists to review  the\r\n\r\nCPF  rates  on  a  periodic basis so  that  it  can  more\r\n\r\naccurately  and  in a more timely fashion  determine  the\r\n\r\nneed  for any rate change.  The CPF Advisory Council  can\r\n\r\nthen   make  the  appropriate  recommendations   to   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  for  consideration, much like  what  the  NWC\r\n\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point relates to the aggrieved middle\r\n\r\naged,  middle  income workers.  Sir, as my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  before me, Mdm Ho and Mr Sin Boon  Ann,  have\r\n\r\nnoted, the aid package announced by DPM\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2963</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLee,  in  terms  of  utilities rebate,  public  transport\r\n\r\nfunds,  etc,  would soothe the pain of the  lower  income\r\n\r\nearners  and unemployed.  Businesses, particularly  those\r\n\r\nin  the  construction, tourism and transport sectors  and\r\n\r\nSMEs,  in  general, will also welcome the reprieve.   But\r\n\r\nthe  group  that will have to bear the brunt of  the  CPF\r\n\r\ncuts   are   the  middle  aged,  middle  income  earners,\r\n\r\nparticularly those aged 50 years and above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the baby boomer generation who have lived\r\n\r\nthrough the tumultuous 50s and 60s, and who perhaps  have\r\n\r\ncontributed  the  most to the economic progress  we  have\r\n\r\nenjoyed.   But this is also the group who will see  their\r\n\r\nCPF  contribution rates fall from 33% to 27% in 2006 with\r\n\r\nthe possibility of falling even further to 24%.  They are\r\n\r\nalso  likely  to be the ones with the heaviest  financial\r\n\r\ncommitments  -  school-going children, some  in  tertiary\r\n\r\ninstitutions, housing mortgage commitments, car loans and\r\n\r\nageing parents taking a bigger and bigger chunk of  their\r\n\r\nmonthly  budgets,  and  eating into  their  own  Medisave\r\n\r\naccounts.  Many could be living in 5-room HDB or  private\r\n\r\nproperties  and are thus unlikely to have  benefited,  if\r\n\r\nany,  from  the  utilities  rebate,  GST  top-up  or  New\r\n\r\nSingapore Shares.  Many of them are probably white collar\r\n\r\nworkers  who  are  also subjected to increasingly  higher\r\n\r\nrisk  of  retrenchment  if they  have  not  already  been\r\n\r\nretrenched.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is small wonder why a recent Straits Times\r\n\r\nsurvey  found that the older Singaporeans aged  45  years\r\n\r\nand  above  are  least  confident  about  the  future  of\r\n\r\nSingapore.    In  fact,  of  late,  they  are   quite   a\r\n\r\ndisillusioned  lot,  judging from the  feedback  from  my\r\n\r\nresidents  and  friends who are in  this  age  group  and\r\n\r\nincome  level.  As a recent feedback session  participant\r\n\r\nlamented,  \"Becoming old is becoming a sin in Singapore!\"\r\n\r\nThoughts  of migrating also seem to be most acutely  felt\r\n\r\nby  this  group of Singaporeans.  With the proceeds  from\r\n\r\nselling  their  assets,  they  are  able  to  migrate  to\r\n\r\ncountries, such as Australia and New Zealand, which  have\r\n\r\na lower cost of living.  In fact, I personally know of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2964</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo  of my grassroots volunteers whose wives and children\r\n\r\nare  living  in Australia with no thoughts of  returning,\r\n\r\nand at least three friends who have recently migrated  to\r\n\r\nNew  Zealand.   All of them are in the age 45  years  and\r\n\r\nabove category and are professionals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am pleased that DPM Lee has announced that\r\n\r\nolder  workers  will get extra when the Government  gives\r\n\r\nback surpluses to the people in the future.  This is what\r\n\r\nI raised in my Budget speech regarding the ERC's proposed\r\n\r\nCPF  changes  in  July 2002 that older workers  be  given\r\n\r\nspecial treatment in the next wealth sharing exercise.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this would go some way to mitigate their\r\n\r\nanguish  and sense of betrayal many middle-aged,  middle-income  earners are feeling, more tangible and  immediate\r\n\r\nmeasures  should be considered to address their concerns,\r\n\r\nhelp  them cope and lift their spirits.  After  all,  the\r\n\r\nproportion  of workers in the 50 to 59 years  age  group,\r\n\r\nwhich  has  been increasing over the years from  9.3%  in\r\n\r\n1991 to 14.5% in 2002, is set to increase further as  our\r\n\r\npopulation ages.  This, coupled with the fact that, as at\r\n\r\nthe end of 2002, professionals, managerial, executive and\r\n\r\ntechnical  staff comprise approximately 42% of the  total\r\n\r\nworkforce, implies that there is a sizeable middle  aged,\r\n\r\nmiddle class workers category who is bearing the brunt of\r\n\r\nthe recent wage cut, retrenchment and CPF cut regime.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older worker phenomenon is here to stay, both as\r\n\r\na  demographic reality, and as more and more Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  compelled  to  work beyond 55 to support  their  own\r\n\r\nretirement.  As analysts have rightly pointed out,  while\r\n\r\nCPF  cuts  hurt  every Singaporean directly,  the  relief\r\n\r\npackage is targeted, comes with strings attached and  may\r\n\r\nnot benefit all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my next and final point, that is,\r\n\r\nlowering  costs.   For  the middle  aged,  middle  income\r\n\r\nworkers,  what  would  be a more concrete  and  effective\r\n\r\nrelief  would be to try and lower the cost of  living  to\r\n\r\noffset the fall in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2965</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nincome  they are currently facing.  Reducing the cost  of\r\n\r\nliving   is  a  point  which  many  of  my  parliamentary\r\n\r\ncolleagues  before me have urged the Government  to  look\r\n\r\ninto.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest EIU report, Singapore\r\n\r\nremains one of the 15th most expensive cities to live in.\r\n\r\nWe  are ahead of many highly-regarded cities, like Sydney\r\n\r\nand  Melbourne and even several American cities, like  LA\r\n\r\nand  San  Francisco as well as Stockholm.    Furthermore,\r\n\r\nthere  are genuine worries that the Government's plan  to\r\n\r\nproceed with the increase in the GST by a further  1%  in\r\n\r\n2004  may  raise the cost of living, and  could  even  be\r\n\r\ncontractionary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am comforted that DPM Lee has announced that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Finance has launched a  civil  service-wide\r\n\r\nEconomy  Drive  to review all discretionary  expenditure.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  civil service  strives  to  cut  waste\r\n\r\nthrough  a  Cut  Waste Panel.  While these  are  laudable\r\n\r\nefforts in response to calls for the Government to do its\r\n\r\npart  to  cut fees and charges, to make a real,  tangible\r\n\r\ndifference  to  the people on the ground,  these  efforts\r\n\r\nmust  translate to actual reduction of costs  to  workers\r\n\r\nand businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government should, in tandem, also review\r\n\r\nits fees and charges, such as ERP charges, taxes on cars,\r\n\r\nlicences  and  even maid levy with a view  to  realigning\r\n\r\nthem  to  what  would now be tantamount to a  lower  wage\r\n\r\nregime.   This would go some way to lowering our cost  of\r\n\r\nliving and doing business, which would benefit all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, the current maid levy was set during\r\n\r\na  period of strong wage growth.  Since the CPF cut is de\r\n\r\nfacto  a  wage cut, the maid levy could be cut in tandem,\r\n\r\neven though we all understand the aim of the levy was  to\r\n\r\nemploy  a  market mechanism to regulate the foreign  maid\r\n\r\npopulation with its attendant social problems.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example would be for the Government to\r\n\r\nfurther   review  its  vehicle  ownership  policy.    For\r\n\r\ninstance, one of my\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2966</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ngrassroots recently told me that now only businesses  are\r\n\r\nallowed  to buy panel vans.  He says that this is against\r\n\r\nthe  move to encourage entrepreneurship.  This is because\r\n\r\nwhilst  registering a company is relatively  inexpensive,\r\n\r\nit  is  all  the  attendant  additional  regulations  and\r\n\r\ncompliance  costs  that come with registering  a  company\r\n\r\nthat pose a hindrance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I realise that there are major fiscal\r\n\r\nimplications  if  many statutory charges,  such  as  maid\r\n\r\nlevy,  etc,  are reduced, and this could well worsen  the\r\n\r\nbudget  deficit,  but following the  principle  of  equal\r\n\r\nmisery,  this might well be the price the Government  has\r\n\r\nto pay in order to signal its empathy with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of the measures announced go even beyond\r\n\r\nthe ERC recommendations which were only released about  a\r\n\r\nyear  ago.   The mantra then was \"re-focusing\"  the  CPF.\r\n\r\nNow,  it  is \"retuning\".  What is evident though is  that\r\n\r\nthe   CPF  is  destined  to  remain  a  major  plank   of\r\n\r\nSingapore's social as well as economic policy,  a  sacred\r\n\r\ncow  slaughtered,  but  also resurrected  in  a  slightly\r\n\r\nmodified form.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That some austerity is called for now will inflict\r\n\r\npain  on  the population and even a sense of betrayal  on\r\n\r\nthe  part  of  workers, especially the  middle  aged  and\r\n\r\nmiddle  income workers, although I must add, a  sense  of\r\n\r\nrelief  as well that the cut in the CPF rate was  not  as\r\n\r\nmuch as feared.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I fully support these changes which the\r\n\r\nPrime  Minister  has announced in order  to  restore  our\r\n\r\ncompetitiveness, I urge the Government to exercise  great\r\n\r\ncompassion and understanding, and to be sensitive to  the\r\n\r\npeople's  concern  and feedback.  I  note  that  this  is\r\n\r\nprecisely   what   has  been  attempted   both   by   the\r\n\r\nannouncement itself as well as the help package  DPM  Lee\r\n\r\nhas put to this House.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore support the changes.\r\n\r\n<br>6.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would like this House to revisit the policy set out in\r\n\r\n1994 on \"asset\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2967</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nworth\"   and   \"asset   enhancement\"   with   regard   to\r\n\r\n\"encouragement  of home ownership for Singaporeans\".   At\r\n\r\nthat  time, the emphasis was on enhancing the  assets  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, increasing their commitment as Singaporeans\r\n\r\nand seeking their support for the political, economic and\r\n\r\nsocial  systems which make owning these assets  possible.\r\n\r\nToday,  however,  it  would seem that  Singaporeans  will\r\n\r\nsupport  policies on the basis of security of their  jobs\r\n\r\nand  on  whether the Government that they have voted  for\r\n\r\nwill give them peace of mind concerning their present and\r\n\r\nfuture  livelihood,  not on whether they  can  own  their\r\n\r\nhomes  quickly  or  whether they can  upgrade  to  bigger\r\n\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, 92% of Singaporeans already own their HDB\r\n\r\nflats,  and  Singapore is tops in the world in  terms  of\r\n\r\nhome   ownership   percentage.   In  the   early   1990s,\r\n\r\nSingapore's growth rates were often more than  9%.   This\r\n\r\nphenomenon has passed and the expected growth  rates  for\r\n\r\nSingapore  will be much lower in the years to  come.   It\r\n\r\nwould  therefore seem that the 1994 policy  needs  to  be\r\n\r\nmoderated, especially for young couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding DPM Lee's announcement last week\r\n\r\nthat  encouraging  home ownership remains  a  fundamental\r\n\r\nobjective of the Government's Public Housing Policy and a\r\n\r\nkey  purpose of the CPF, I feel that retuning this policy\r\n\r\nwill  be  timely under our present circumstances.   I  am\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  Singaporeans  give  up  this  dream  of\r\n\r\nownership  mentioned earlier by the Acting  Minister  for\r\n\r\nManpower, but I am saying that there is no hurry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is timely for us to look at the following issues\r\n\r\nas  examples  where  we should adjust  according  to  our\r\n\r\npresent  needs  in  addition to what had  been  announced\r\n\r\nearlier today by the Minister for National Development.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young couples should be able to have the choice of\r\n\r\nrental   flats  rather  than  buying  new  flats.    Less\r\n\r\ncommitment  in  the early days of joining  the  workforce\r\n\r\nmeans greater flexibility in the ability to adapt to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2968</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe working environment, which can be very fluid in these\r\n\r\ntimes  of a globalised economy.  They are also less bound\r\n\r\nby  commitments  and, therefore, are able  to  take  more\r\n\r\nrisks,  should  they want to venture out  on  their  own.\r\n\r\nThis  augurs well, especially amongst our young, for  our\r\n\r\nstrive  towards being a more entrepreneurial nation.   It\r\n\r\nhas  been  argued that HDB rental flats are very  heavily\r\n\r\nsubsidised, and are meant only for those who are in  dire\r\n\r\nneed.    Those  in  difficulty  should  continue  to   be\r\n\r\nsubsidised heavily through means testing.  Flats catering\r\n\r\nto  the  needs of young families should be made available\r\n\r\nfor  rental, so that they have that choice of renting HDB\r\n\r\nflats until such time when they are more sure-footed with\r\n\r\ntheir  commitments.   Presently,  there  are  only  about\r\n\r\n60,000  rental  flats  available, and  there  is  a  long\r\n\r\nwaiting  period for an allocation.  It would be  good  if\r\n\r\nmore HDB flats are built to cater to the rental needs  of\r\n\r\nyoung couples.  Moreover, the choice of starting a family\r\n\r\nshould be encouraged, and this priority for young couples\r\n\r\nshould be assisted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans may have to downgrade now because\r\n\r\nthey are unable to meet the monthly instalments resulting\r\n\r\nfrom  a reduction in CPF, pay cuts or uncertainty of  job\r\n\r\nprospects.   More  than 5,000 families moved  to  smaller\r\n\r\nflats  in  2002,  a 23% jump from 2001.   This  trend  is\r\n\r\nunlikely  to ease soon when the economic growth  forecast\r\n\r\nfor this year has been slashed to between 0% and 1%.  The\r\n\r\ngranting  of  HDB loans to downgraders is not permissible\r\n\r\npresently, although the Minister for National Development\r\n\r\nsaid  earlier that his Ministry would consider on a case-by-case  basis  for those in great difficulty.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike to urge for a change in this HDB policy.  Those  who\r\n\r\nwant  to  downgrade are being prudent here and should  be\r\n\r\nhelped.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel that it is now time\r\n\r\nto  relook and revamp another of our \"sacred cows\".  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  mean  our  Medisave accounts.  In  our  heavily  human\r\n\r\nresource-dependent economy, our economic health has to go\r\n\r\nhand in hand with good health of our people.  The present\r\n\r\nMedisave system, where we save and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2969</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npay  as we go, financing for healthcare, is becoming less\r\n\r\nadequate to serve our needs, especially when our  society\r\n\r\nis   fast  aging  and  people  are  living  longer.    By\r\n\r\nretirement  age,  healthcare costs  are  expected  to  be\r\n\r\nhigher.  Medisave has a low rate of return within the CPF\r\n\r\nmechanism   and  has  inadequate  real   growth   to   be\r\n\r\nsufficiently available when needed in old age.   We  need\r\n\r\nto  make  drastic  changes here  and  now  for  a  better\r\n\r\ntomorrow.  Risk pooling in health care finance is a  good\r\n\r\nconsideration.   Currently, we  have  individual  medical\r\n\r\nsavings accounts (Medisave) with no risk pooling,  and  a\r\n\r\nnational    catastrophic   illness    insurance    scheme\r\n\r\n(MediShield)   which  covers  prolonged   and   expensive\r\n\r\ntreatment  which  does  pool  risks  but  minimally.   In\r\n\r\naddition,  there  is a complex system of co-payments  and\r\n\r\ndeductibles, which involves direct out-of-pocket  private\r\n\r\npayments.   It  is  timely  to  convert  savings  in  the\r\n\r\nMedisave into more risk pooling insurance schemes with co-payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Japan has achieved the\r\n\r\nlowest  infant  mortality  rate  and  the  highest   life\r\n\r\nexpectancy  in  the world.  Long-term  observers  of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  healthcare  system have  concluded  that  Japan\r\n\r\nachieved  these  healthcare outcomes at  a  comparatively\r\n\r\nsmall  price:  \"Japan's healthcare system helps  to  keep\r\n\r\nits  population  healthy  at an exceptionally  low  cost.\r\n\r\nThey  rate  the  Japanese system  as  excellent  in  cost\r\n\r\ncontrol   and   access,  and  very  good  in   equality.\"\r\n\r\nUniversal  health  insurance coverage  has  been  key  in\r\n\r\nbringing  about these results.  Japan started its  health\r\n\r\ninsurance  expansion in 1961.  Today, Japan's  healthcare\r\n\r\nsystem  has  universal  health  insurance  coverage  that\r\n\r\ncovers the entire population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organisation defines risk pooling\r\n\r\nas  \"the practice of bringing several risks together  for\r\n\r\ninsurance  purposes in order to balance the  consequences\r\n\r\nof  the realisation of each individual.\"  Risk pooling is\r\n\r\nthe  health  system  function, whereby  collected  health\r\n\r\nrevenues  are  transferred  to purchasing  organisations.\r\n\r\nPooling ensures that the risk related to financing health\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2970</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninterventions is borne by all the members  of  the  pool,\r\n\r\nand  not  by  each  contributor individually.   Its  main\r\n\r\npurpose  is to share the financial risks associated  with\r\n\r\nhealth interventions, for which there is uncertain  need.\r\n\r\nRisk pooling is required because of the large uncertainty\r\n\r\nin the magnitude and timing of an individual's healthcare\r\n\r\nexpenditure   needs.    It  implies  the   redistributive\r\n\r\nfunctions  from  the healthy to the sick,  and  from  the\r\n\r\nproductive  to the unproductive stage of the life  cycle.\r\n\r\nThe  arguments  in favour of risk pooling  in  healthcare\r\n\r\nreflect equity and efficiency considerations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Report 2000 puts emphasis on the\r\n\r\nrole  of  government  in terms of  \"stewardship\"  of  the\r\n\r\nhealth sector.  According to this report, this attractive\r\n\r\nvision  of  a far-sighted and public-spirited  regulatory\r\n\r\ncapacity  is hard to envisage in the absence of a  strong\r\n\r\nrisk-pooling  function, which is a necessary  one  for  a\r\n\r\nwider range of health service functions that we associate\r\n\r\nwith  developed  health systems, such  as  rising  health\r\n\r\nexpenditure, demographic change and technical innovation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the role of preventive care and keeping healthy\r\n\r\ncannot  be over emphasised in any healthcare issues.   In\r\n\r\nour  health  insurance expansion planning therefore  some\r\n\r\nincentives  should be incorporated to rally  Singaporeans\r\n\r\ntowards keeping fit and healthy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue in health insurance expansion is to\r\n\r\nalso  ensure coverage for Singaporeans when they  are  in\r\n\r\ndire  need,  such as when they are without  jobs  and  in\r\n\r\nbetween jobs, in view of our present and future trends of\r\n\r\nunemployment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two key features of Japanese healthcare\r\n\r\nfinancing are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, universal coverage that is achieved through\r\n\r\na  multi-tiered insurance system with varying degrees  of\r\n\r\nsubsidisation   according  to  the   perceived   economic\r\n\r\nvulnerability on the part of the population insured; and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2971</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the provider payment side, healthcare\r\n\r\nfinancing  in  Japan  is characterised  by  reimbursement\r\n\r\naccording to a nationally uniform fee schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the combination of universal coverage with\r\n\r\nstrict   enforcement  of  the  uniform  fee  schedule   - preventing balance billing, etc - that has been  critical\r\n\r\nin  avoiding  some  of  the problems  of  cost  inflation\r\n\r\nobserved  in  other  countries.  The Japanese  experience\r\n\r\nthus   indicates  that  the  main  risks  in   healthcare\r\n\r\ninsurance,  \"incomplete coverage of  the  population  and\r\n\r\nrising costs\", may be manageable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude that good health\r\n\r\ninsurance  expansion  encompasses  a  national   coverage\r\n\r\ninvolving the entire population with dependable  coverage\r\n\r\nyear  after  year, and stable premiums and benefits.   We\r\n\r\nshould,   therefore,  explore  ways  to   achieve   these\r\n\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beseech Prime Minister Goh and Deputy Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  Lee to set on this path of embarking on  health\r\n\r\ninsurance expansion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for\r\n\r\nallowing me to speak on the \"Retuning of CPF Rates\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Government has decided to lower the\r\n\r\nemployer's  CPF contribution rate by 3%.  I believe  many\r\n\r\nSingaporeans would feel a sense of relief because this is\r\n\r\nlower  than the expected 6% cut.  However, some employers\r\n\r\nmay be disappointed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is whether the 3% reduction is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis is like taking antibiotics.  If you need a dosage of\r\n\r\n6  ml,  but you take only 3 ml, it is not going to  work.\r\n\r\nWhether   the  3%  reduction  is  sufficient  is   really\r\n\r\ndependent on what the objective of the adjustment is.  If\r\n\r\nit  is just to ease the burden of the businesses so  that\r\n\r\nthey  can  stay afloat, then the 3% is certainly helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever,  if  the adjustment is to fundamentally  enhance\r\n\r\nour national competitiveness, then the answer may not be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2972</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat  obvious.   In fact, this may not be a  question  of\r\n\r\nnumbers after all.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. First, even with the CPF\r\n\r\nadjustment,  our wage system remains rigid.  Perhaps,  we\r\n\r\ncan  take this opportunity to push ahead with fundamental\r\n\r\nchanges  in  our  wage structure.  Since our  people  are\r\n\r\npsychologically  prepared for the 6% adjustment  and  the\r\n\r\nactual  reduction is only 3%, is it possible  for  us  to\r\n\r\ntransfer  the other 3% to the Monthly Variable  Component\r\n\r\n(MVC)?  In that way, we can give MVC a headstart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Prime Minister announced that the long-term target for our CPF contribution rates should be\r\n\r\nbetween 30% and 36%.  By giving it a range rather than  a\r\n\r\nfixed  rate  will  undoubtedly give the  Government  more\r\n\r\nflexibility.   However, this will  lead  to  uncertainty.\r\n\r\nPeople  will be concerned that the Government may  adjust\r\n\r\nthe  CPF rates from time to time.  It would therefore  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  for  the  people and the businessmen  to  make\r\n\r\nfinancial planning.  For example, when the economy  picks\r\n\r\nup,  some  employers might not be willing  to  raise  the\r\n\r\nsalaries  of their employees for fear that the Government\r\n\r\nmay  raise the CPF contribution rate later.  I  think  it\r\n\r\nmay be better if we can set a more definite CPF rate, and\r\n\r\nallow  the  businesses and the people to make  their  own\r\n\r\nadjustments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some employers are concerned that this 3%\r\n\r\ncut  may not be effective. Compared to labour cost in the\r\n\r\ndeveloping  countries, this 3% seems to be insignificant.\r\n\r\nObviously, we cannot compare our wage cost with  that  of\r\n\r\nChina  and  India.  In fact, be it 3% or 6%,  it  is  not\r\n\r\ngoing  to bring our wage cost anywhere near that of these\r\n\r\ncountries.   The  issue is not about the quantum  of  the\r\n\r\nadjustment.   In  fact,  we  should  not  look  at  these\r\n\r\ncountries  as our competitors but as strategic  partners.\r\n\r\nWhile  they  compete  with us, they  also  offer  us  new\r\n\r\nopportunities.  Therefore, I feel that we should  have  a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive  strategy, not just to lower  our  business\r\n\r\ncost, but also to enhance our macro-economic environment.\r\n\r\nWe must build a strategic network with these economies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2973</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nso  that we can play a significant role in their economic\r\n\r\ngrowth.  I believe it is necessary for the Government  to\r\n\r\nexplain  this strategy to the public, so that the  people\r\n\r\nwill have more confidence in the Government and will  not\r\n\r\nlose heart.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the relief package. The $1\r\n\r\nbillion relief package announced by DPM Lee last week was\r\n\r\nmost reassuring.  It is an indication that the Government\r\n\r\nis  aware  of  the difficulties faced by the people,  and\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  willing to extend a helping  hand  whenever\r\n\r\nnecessary.  I would like to highlight three areas for the\r\n\r\nGovernment to look into.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, education. Many low-income families may have\r\n\r\ndifficulties   meeting  the  cost  of  their   children's\r\n\r\neducation.   Other than the school fees,  other  expenses\r\n\r\nsuch  as books, miscellaneous fees, school bus, uniforms,\r\n\r\netc, can be quite costly too.  I hope that the Government\r\n\r\nwould  consider providing schools with more bursaries  or\r\n\r\nwelfare  funds,  and make appropriate adjustment  to  the\r\n\r\nqualifying criteria for such subsidies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I believe that the adjustment to the CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution rate will also result in some savings to the\r\n\r\nGovernment. I hope that the Government can pass  on  some\r\n\r\nof  these savings to the people through reduction in  tax\r\n\r\nrates and fees.  DPM Lee has confirmed that the GST  will\r\n\r\ngo  up  as  scheduled next year. Although we are somewhat\r\n\r\ndisappointed,   we   can  understand   the   Government's\r\n\r\nposition.   However,  we hope that  the  Government  will\r\n\r\nconsider  lowering  some  of its  charges,  such  as  the\r\n\r\nconservancy and service charges for the HDB flats, so  as\r\n\r\nto  send  a  signal to the people that the Government  is\r\n\r\nwilling  and  prepared to share weal and  woe,  joys  and\r\n\r\nsorrows, with the people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I am glad to see that the Government has\r\n\r\nproposed  a  $600  million  package  to  pump-prime   the\r\n\r\ndomestic    economy,   specifically   for   smaller-scale\r\n\r\nprojects,  so that our local contractors would  have  the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to participate.  What I am worried  is  that\r\n\r\nmany local contractors\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2974</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  already financially stretched.  They may  need  more\r\n\r\ntime to prepare the tender documents and raise financing.\r\n\r\nSome may even have to be restructured first.  I hope that\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  departments will take these problems  into\r\n\r\nconsideration, when they call for tender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with the lowering of our wage cost, we have no\r\n\r\nchoice  but to bring down our standard of living and  our\r\n\r\nexpectations.   As  we adjust, we must be  prepared  that\r\n\r\nthere will not be without pain.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me conclude my speech with 3Cs. First of all, we\r\n\r\nmust  have  \"Confidence\".  Our battle  against  SARS  has\r\n\r\nstrengthened  the  confidence  and  bonding  between  the\r\n\r\npeople  and  the Government.  I believe that Singaporeans\r\n\r\nnow have greater confidence in the Government's judgement\r\n\r\nand decision-making.  Only when we have confidence in the\r\n\r\nfuture,  will we have the courage to face the  challenges\r\n\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second C is \"Commitment\". We must be committed\r\n\r\nto  implementing strategic measures.  To endure  a  short\r\n\r\npain  is far better than to suffer a long agony.  We must\r\n\r\nact  fast  to reform our wage structure and to  turn  our\r\n\r\neconomy around.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third C is \"Common goal\". In order to\r\n\r\neffectively  resolve our economic crisis,  we  must  stay\r\n\r\nunited  as  one people and one nation with a common  goal\r\n\r\nand  move  towards a common direction.  If  we  have  the\r\n\r\nconfidence, commitment and a common goal, we will be able\r\n\r\nto bring our economy back on the road to recovery, create\r\n\r\nmore  job opportunities and bring back prosperity.  Then,\r\n\r\nwe can all truly feel relieved.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I support the CPF changes as  proposed  by\r\n\r\nthe Prime Minister. These changes are indeed drastic, but\r\n\r\nare   necessary  to  prepare  Singapore  for  its  future\r\n\r\nchallenges. Faced with increased competition and  a  fast\r\n\r\nageing  population, the proposed CPF changes will provide\r\n\r\nan impetus to sustain economic growth in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2975</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF changes and relief measures sent out three\r\n\r\nclear  signals  to boost the confidence of our  potential\r\n\r\ninvestors, our existing businesses and our people. To the\r\n\r\npotential  investors,  it shows that  our  Government  is\r\n\r\nalways  prepared  to  take tough  measures  to  keep  our\r\n\r\nbusiness  costs  competitive.  This  will  attract   more\r\n\r\ninvestments, thus creating more jobs for Singaporeans. To\r\n\r\nthe  existing  businesses, the three-point CPF  cut  will\r\n\r\nprovide  an essential lifeline for businesses to  improve\r\n\r\ntheir  capabilities  to sustain their  businesses.   This\r\n\r\nwill  save jobs and allow businesses to source  for  more\r\n\r\nbusiness opportunities.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Singaporeans, the changes will boost their\r\n\r\nconfidence in terms of better job security and  more  job\r\n\r\nopportunities.  At the same time, it sends a clear signal\r\n\r\nto  all  Singaporeans  that we must  save  more  for  our\r\n\r\nretirement,   and  be  more  prudent  in  our   financial\r\n\r\nplanning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans understand and support these CPF\r\n\r\nchanges,  although  it  means a reduction  of  their  CPF\r\n\r\nsavings.   These are painful measures which affect  their\r\n\r\nquality of life.  But Singaporeans are confident that the\r\n\r\nGovernment will lead them out of the present unemployment\r\n\r\nsituation.    With  lesser  CPF  savings,  I   hope   the\r\n\r\nGovernment can do more to help Singaporeans \"stretch  the\r\n\r\ndollar  value of their CPF savings\".  In this  regard,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to suggest three areas where the  Government\r\n\r\ncan help Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, CPF for housing. Sir, to overcome the\r\n\r\nsituation  of  Singaporeans being \"asset  rich  but  cash\r\n\r\npoor\"  upon retirement, we need to review the HDB housing\r\n\r\npolicies.   These  include  the  development  policy  for\r\n\r\ndifferent  flat  types, pricing formula  for  new  flats,\r\n\r\ndebarment  periods for those who sold  their  flats,  and\r\n\r\nalso  the  rental  flat  policy.  We  must  provide  more\r\n\r\nhousing  options for retirees to liquidate  their  assets\r\n\r\nand  cash out their savings for retirement. We must  give\r\n\r\nretirees  more  options to either own a smaller  flat  or\r\n\r\nrent a flat at affordable prices upon retirement.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2976</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relaxation of HDB rental policy to allow those\r\n\r\nwho own their flats for 15 years to rent their flats is a\r\n\r\nwelcome   move.    But   with  the  present   string   of\r\n\r\nrestrictions  by HDB, it may not be easy for  these  flat\r\n\r\nowners to find cheaper alternative accommodation if  they\r\n\r\nwere  to rent their flats. As such, only a small fraction\r\n\r\nof  the 250,000 flat owners will be able to benefit  from\r\n\r\nthis relief measure.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also review the affordability criteria\r\n\r\nand  pricing  formula of HDB flats.  The pricing  of  HDB\r\n\r\nflats should not be on the basis that 90% of Singaporeans\r\n\r\ncould  afford a 3-room flat. HDB has stopped building  3-room  flats since the 1980s.  As such, I do not know what\r\n\r\nis  the  price of a 3-room flat, which the formula adopts\r\n\r\nto work out the affordability index.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since HDB flats are liberalised, we should adopt a\r\n\r\nmarket pricing mechanism whereby HDB flats are priced not\r\n\r\naccording  to  affordability, but on market  prices  with\r\n\r\nGovernment subsidy.  For example, a new 100 square  metre\r\n\r\n4-room HDB flat with a 99-year lease can be priced  close\r\n\r\nto  a private apartment without condominium facilities of\r\n\r\nthe  same  size based on its location, design  and  floor\r\n\r\nheight.    Thereafter,  the  net  sale  price  shall   be\r\n\r\ndetermined  after  deducting  the  market  price  with  a\r\n\r\nprescribed  Government subsidy for  4-room  flats.   This\r\n\r\nwould  better  reflect  the Government  subsidy  and  the\r\n\r\nmarket value of new HDB flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a growing ageing population, it is crucial for\r\n\r\nthe  Government to plan and provide more housing  options\r\n\r\nfor  the elderly.  Elderly couples with grown-up children\r\n\r\nprefer  to live near their children, but may not be  able\r\n\r\nto  purchase a 4- or 5-room flat based on market  prices.\r\n\r\nToday,  the 4- and 5-room housing mix, especially in  our\r\n\r\nnew  towns, does not facilitate elderly couples  to  stay\r\n\r\nnear  their children.   Thus, I would urge the Government\r\n\r\nto  consider developing a better housing mix of different\r\n\r\nflat  types  (1,  2  or 3 bedroom flats)  as  in  private\r\n\r\ncondominiums   to   offer  more   housing   options   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help retirees to liquidate their assets, HDB\r\n\r\nshould explore reverse mortgage\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2977</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nschemes.   It  should  also provide more  rental  housing\r\n\r\nflats for the elderly.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With lesser CPF savings, young couples may take a\r\n\r\nlonger  time  to save for their HDB flats, especially  if\r\n\r\nthey  face certain periods of unemployment.  In order  to\r\n\r\nencourage  more  young  Singaporeans  to  form   families\r\n\r\nearlier, HDB should reduce the downpayment for new  flats\r\n\r\nfor first-time applicants.  This is especially so for  4-room  flats  which are within the means  of  the  working\r\n\r\nclass Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, CPF for healthcare. Sir, I fully support\r\n\r\nthe  efforts by the Health Minister to lower health costs\r\n\r\nin   Singapore.    Many  Singaporeans,   especially   the\r\n\r\nheartlanders,  are  indeed  concerned  about   healthcare\r\n\r\ncosts.    The  risk  of  individuals  or  family  members\r\n\r\ndepleting their Medisave accounts is high if one of their\r\n\r\nfamily members falls critically ill.  The safety net  for\r\n\r\nmedical expenses is presently inadequate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to keep medical costs affordable and\r\n\r\nencourage  more  Singaporeans to save for  their  medical\r\n\r\nneeds, as they grow older.  Sir, I support the adjustment\r\n\r\nof  the Medisave Minimum Sum of $25,000 to cope with  the\r\n\r\ninflation  of  health costs.  I would  suggest  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  should develop an inflation index to  measure\r\n\r\nand  monitor health costs and healthcare expenditures  of\r\n\r\nSingaporeans closely.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Health Ministry should also adopt a holistic\r\n\r\napproach  to promote healthy lifestyle among Singaporeans\r\n\r\nmore aggressively.  We should provide more facilities  or\r\n\r\navenues for Singaporeans to keep fit.  In this regard,  I\r\n\r\nhope  the Government would accelerate the development  of\r\n\r\npark  connectors,  upgrading  of  sports  complexes   and\r\n\r\nprovide    more    support   to   encourage    grassroots\r\n\r\norganisations to organise more keep fit activities,  such\r\n\r\nas   brisk   walking,  tai-chi,  qigong  or   silat   for\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, CPF for retirement. To many working class\r\n\r\nSingaporeans, the CPF\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2978</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsaving  is  probably  their only saving  for  retirement.\r\n\r\nSingaporeans earning less than $2,000 will not be able to\r\n\r\nsave  much if they need to pay for their housing, medical\r\n\r\ncare and support their children.  As such, the Government\r\n\r\nshould help Singaporeans to increase the returns of their\r\n\r\nCPF   savings.    The  CPF  Board  should   adopt   clear\r\n\r\nperformance benchmarks and invest in a wider portfolio of\r\n\r\ninvestments  to maximise the returns of its  funds.   The\r\n\r\nreturns to CPF savings should also be based on a formula,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  regularly  updated, so that  CPF  members  can\r\n\r\nbenefit more from their savings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, based on the CDC's experience in helping\r\n\r\nSingaporeans to find jobs, we find that three  groups  of\r\n\r\njob-seekers  have much difficulty in finding  jobs.  They\r\n\r\nare:  (1) Singaporeans who are medically unfit or require\r\n\r\nregular   medical  treatment,  such  as  kidney  dialysis\r\n\r\ntreatment;  (2) those suffering from mental illness;  and\r\n\r\n(3)  those  with  criminal records.   I  would  urge  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  do more to help these people  to  make  a\r\n\r\ndecent  living.   The Work Assistance Programme  may  not\r\n\r\nhelp  these Singaporeans to secure jobs as employers  are\r\n\r\nnot  keen  to  employ  them.  I hope the  Government  can\r\n\r\nconsider creating some jobs to help these Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which the Government can create jobs, and\r\n\r\nat  the  same time improve its customer services,  is  to\r\n\r\nremove  the  automated telephone system  for  all  public\r\n\r\nagencies  and  the Ministries. These automated  telephone\r\n\r\nsystems  are often inaccessible or engaged at all  times.\r\n\r\nTo  promote excellence in public services, the Government\r\n\r\nshould  consider  training Singaporeans  to  be  customer\r\n\r\nservice officers, manning these frontline operations,  at\r\n\r\nleast  during office hours.  This would not  only  create\r\n\r\njobs  but  also improve the image of Government agencies.\r\n\r\nIt will also enable many people to make enquiries through\r\n\r\nthe  phone  instead of wasting time to come down  to  the\r\n\r\nvarious Government agencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the CPF changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 2979</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I intend to stop here.
