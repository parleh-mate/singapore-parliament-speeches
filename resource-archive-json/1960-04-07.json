I  am\r\n\r\nquoting from the Straits Tunes of Thursday, 31st\r\n\r\nMarch:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Wisdom came with tolerance and understanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Sir,  the  leaders  of  the  Singapore  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnion,   under  the  tutelage  of  the   present\r\n\r\nPolitical   Secretary   in   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation, who was the Secretary-General of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Teachers  Union for  many  years,  of\r\n\r\ncourse,  learned  to  develop  very  independent\r\n\r\nminds  on many questions. No doubt they did  rub\r\n\r\nsome  Ministry officials on the wrong  side  and\r\n\r\nvery  likely  they  are not  regarded  as  quite\r\n\r\npersona grata by the Ministry of Education.  But\r\n\r\nall  the same, Sir, the Singapore Teachers Union\r\n\r\nis  the largest union of English school teachers\r\n\r\nand,  as such, I think they should be allowed  a\r\n\r\nrepresentative on this Adult Education Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of the work will have to be carried\r\n\r\nout  with  the  assistance of teachers  teaching\r\n\r\nnight classes, and I think it is only right that\r\n\r\nthey  should  be represented on  this  Board  to\r\n\r\ndiscuss policies and give advice and suggestions\r\n\r\non   planned  schemes  so  that  they  will   be\r\n\r\nworkable. Also, Sir, if their representative  is\r\n\r\non  this  Board, they will naturally  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey should co-operate more wholeheartedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson, Sir, at one meeting of\r\n\r\nthe  Select Committee on this Bill, did say that\r\n\r\nteachers and head teachers were like drivers and\r\n\r\nconductors   employed   in   the   Ministry   of\r\n\r\nEducation,  and  that the Ministry  was  like  a\r\n\r\nBoard of Directors. Sir, I hope that is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot the policy of the Government, because if  it\r\n\r\nis,  then  one regrets to say that in  the  days\r\n\r\nwhen  Singapore was governed by colonial rulers,\r\n\r\nthere  were  representatives of teachers  unions\r\n\r\nand  head  teachers conferences on the Education\r\n\r\nAdvisory   Committee.   They   took   part    in\r\n\r\ndeliberations  regarding  plans   and   policies\r\n\r\naffecting education in the Colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do believe, Sir, that if we take the attitude\r\n\r\nthat  teachers  and  head  teachers  are  merely\r\n\r\nservants  to be ordered about, then we will  not\r\n\r\nget  the  maximum effort from them. There  is  a\r\n\r\ndifference  between people who  are  treated  as\r\n\r\nservants  and those who are treated  as  friends\r\n\r\nand  partners. I believe that teachers and  head\r\n\r\nteachers will produce the maximum effort if they\r\n\r\nare treated as friends and partners in the field\r\n\r\nof education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Chinese schools now being treated on a\r\n\r\nparity with English schools naturally would want\r\n\r\nrepresentation  on this Board.  Of  course,  the\r\n\r\nideal  thing would be to have just one  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnion  and  one  Head  Teachers  Conference   to\r\n\r\ninclude   members  of  the  teaching  profession\r\n\r\nteaching in the different media. But until  that\r\n\r\ncomes to pass, I am afraid, Sir, that we have to\r\n\r\nregard the situation as it now stands and invite\r\n\r\nthe    representatives   from   the    different\r\n\r\norganisations so that they will be able to  help\r\n\r\nthe Government in its plans on adult education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that because of disagreement\r\n\r\nbetween   the   Ministry  officials   and   some\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of the Singapore Teachers Union,\r\n\r\nthe Joint Consultative Committee was abolished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, reminding ourselves of the words of the\r\n\r\nHon, the  Deputy Prime Minister,  \"Wisdom  came\r\n\r\nwith tolerance and understanding,\" I am sure  in\r\n\r\nthat  spirit teachers Will respond. It was  this\r\n\r\nspirit  which the Hon, the Minister  for  Labour\r\n\r\nand  Law  said  was  being  implemented  in  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Relations Bill which has now  become\r\n\r\nan  Ordinance.

You have the inspectorate,  the  jagas\r\n\r\nwho  open and shut the classrooms and the kebuns\r\n\r\nwho  sweep  the  floor.  What  about  all  these\r\n\r\npeople?  Are  they to be represented  separately\r\n\r\ntoo?  Is  representation of these  units  to  be\r\n\r\ngiven  separately too? What about the clerks  in\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  and those in the Cultural  Centre\r\n\r\nwho  will do paper work in connection with adult\r\n\r\neducation. Are they to be represented too? I  am\r\n\r\nsure  the  Member is aware that  Government  has\r\n\r\ncalled for volunteers and it is very likely that\r\n\r\nthe  adult  classes  will be staffed  with  non-professional teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>2.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public, the civil servants, what\r\n\r\nabout representation for these people? These are\r\n\r\nthe  people who will also be called upon  to  do\r\n\r\nwork in connection with adult education. Sir, to\r\n\r\nsuggest  that  teachers must be  represented  on\r\n\r\nthis   Board  just  because  they  are   workers\r\n\r\nconnected  with adult education is not  a  valid\r\n\r\nsuggestion. That is exactly what I say.  But  if\r\n\r\nwe say: are workers as such to be represented on\r\n\r\nthe  Board? Is our working class as such  to  be\r\n\r\nrepresented  on the Board? Is there a  provision\r\n\r\nto this effect? I say there is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trades Union Congress, which is the parent\r\n\r\nbody  of  all  categories of  workers,  has  the\r\n\r\nprivilege of nominating two members who, besides\r\n\r\nbeing active participants in the formulation  of\r\n\r\nthe  policies  of the Board, will have  a  moral\r\n\r\nobligation  to look after the interests  of  the\r\n\r\nteachers.  And exactly who should be  appointed,\r\n\r\nis  a  matter for the T.U.C. to decide.  Whether\r\n\r\nkebuns,  or jagas, drivers or conductors,  or  a\r\n\r\nprincipal  in  the form of the hon.

What I did ask  for  was\r\n\r\nthat  there  should be increased representation,\r\n\r\nbecause  as  at present composed or constituted,\r\n\r\nwe  have  7  Government nominees,  2  University\r\n\r\nnominees  who could become Government  nominees,\r\n\r\nand  only 2 T.U.C. nominees who are, as it were,\r\n\r\nindependently nominated. Surely the presence  or\r\n\r\nthe inclusion of a few more representatives from\r\n\r\nthe Teachers' Union and Head Teachers Conference\r\n\r\nwould  be  of assistance to the Board and  would\r\n\r\ngive   the  Board  a  slight  leavening  of   an\r\n\r\nindependent element which is really all  to  the\r\n\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy is a system which works more\r\n\r\nslowly   no   doubt,   but   nonetheless    more\r\n\r\neffectively, because those who are interested in\r\n\r\nan  enterprise are invited to share their  views\r\n\r\nand  sometimes to share opposition views. If  it\r\n\r\nis  the  purpose of Government to  have  on  the\r\n\r\nBoard just people who will say, \"We agree\", then\r\n\r\nof  course  the  present  composition  is  quite\r\n\r\nsufficient. But I envisage that it is the desire\r\n\r\nof  Government  to  have also  Opposition  views\r\n\r\nwhich  could  be considered but  it  should  not\r\n\r\ndominate the discussions. That I agree. Since it\r\n\r\nis   a  Government-financed  organisation,   the\r\n\r\npreponderance of votes must be under the control\r\n\r\nof  the  Government. That is understood. But  to\r\n\r\nhave  just two nominated by the T.U.C. and  the\r\n\r\nothers  nominated  by the Government,  I  think,\r\n\r\nSir, there is a case for having an increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, I am not familiar with all the\r\n\r\nintricacies  of  the problem which  we  are  now\r\n\r\ndiscussing. But it does seem to me that the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin  cannot  get  rid  of   his\r\n\r\ncolonial  past.  The  basic  assumption  in  his\r\n\r\nargument  is  that any person appointed  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is there to act as a rubber stamp. It\r\n\r\nmay  be that his long experience as a Government\r\n\r\nnominee in the colonial government has fortified\r\n\r\nhim  in  this belief. But I can assure you,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,   that  when  we,   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment, appoint members to Boards, we do not\r\n\r\nexpect  them  to  do what we tell  them  to  do;\r\n\r\nbecause if that were the case, then there  would\r\n\r\nbe no need at all for establishing such a Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout his argument, the hon.

I can assure him that we do not  expect\r\n\r\nhim  perhaps to understand the whole  philosophy\r\n\r\non which our Party is based. But he is making  a\r\n\r\nprofound  mistake  if  he  thinks  that  members\r\n\r\nappointed  by the P.A.P.

But, Sir,  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  is  most undemocratic  - that  is  the\r\n\r\npoint.  If we are a Government that believes  in\r\n\r\ndemocracy,   the   procedure   must   also    be\r\n\r\ndemocratic, and in that case the representatives\r\n\r\non the Board must be nominated by the bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am not at all grateful, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,   Sir,  for  this  little   lesson   on\r\n\r\ndemocratic   procedure  from  the   Member   for\r\n\r\nTanglin.  But there is no parallel  between  the\r\n\r\nfunctions and duties of a Board such as that  we\r\n\r\nare  considering today and those of the Assembly\r\n\r\nof  this  House.

But  I\r\n\r\nunderstand,  Sir,  that among the  assets  which\r\n\r\nwould  be  controlled by the  Board  are  assets\r\n\r\ncontributed  by private individuals  and  assets\r\n\r\nbrought from the Colonial Development Fund. That\r\n\r\nbeing  so,  Sir, naturally it is  not  a  purely\r\n\r\nGovernment    organisation.

M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I had\r\n\r\noccasion  to  compliment  the  sagacity  of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Tanglin because he chose the path  of\r\n\r\nwisdom in deciding that silence was golden, when\r\n\r\npearls of wisdom were dropping from the lips  of\r\n\r\nmy  Friends  opposite. But I must  say  that  my\r\n\r\nconfidence in him this afternoon has really been\r\n\r\nshattered and mistaken. Mr Speaker, Sir, I have\r\n\r\naccused  my  Friends opposite of  never  reading\r\n\r\nGovernment bills. It is a human thing to dislike\r\n\r\nGovernment  bills, but I do not  think  you  can\r\n\r\never excuse anybody for failing to read at least\r\n\r\nnewspaper reports of these proceedings. It  must\r\n\r\nhave  dawned  on  the mind  of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin  that  a new set up in the  Trade  Union\r\n\r\nworld was being attempted by this Government. If\r\n\r\nhe  had taken the trouble to read the newspapers\r\n\r\nthis morning, he would have found out that there\r\n\r\nis  a provision in the new Trade Union Bill that\r\n\r\nonly  unions which are affiliated to the  Trades\r\n\r\nUnion  Congress  will  be  registered  as  trade\r\n\r\nunions. And when they cease to be affiliated  to\r\n\r\nthe  Trades  Union congress, they  cease  to  be\r\n\r\nregistered unions. He would have seen the report\r\n\r\nthat   whereas  before  any  seven   disgruntled\r\n\r\npersons can constitute themselves into a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntrade  union,  the Government now proposes  that\r\n\r\nthere  must at least be 250 members in  a  trade\r\n\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are making a break from the past. In the\r\n\r\npast  the  Trades Union Congress  was  just  one\r\n\r\nunion  out of 250 unions. We are putting an  end\r\n\r\nto  all  that.  And that is why  we  propose  to\r\n\r\ncompel affiliation to the T.U.C. before a  union\r\n\r\ncan be registered as a union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has\r\n\r\nexplained   to  the  Member  for   Tanglin   how\r\n\r\nridiculous  it  would be if,  say,  any  special\r\n\r\ngroup   of   workers  were  given  any   special\r\n\r\nrepresentation  in  an  organisation  like  this\r\n\r\nAdult  Education Board. Why should the  teachers\r\n\r\nbe   given  any  special  representation?  Other\r\n\r\nmembers of our community are also associated  in\r\n\r\nthese  activities. If the teachers have a  valid\r\n\r\nclaim to any special representation, others  who\r\n\r\nvolunteer,  may be in other organisations,  also\r\n\r\nhave  an  equal claim for special representation\r\n\r\nin these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard him all the time talking about\r\n\r\ndemocratic  principles  and  all  that  sort  of\r\n\r\nthing, but he has never answered the point  that\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for Thomson has made. Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,   we  have  been  indulgent  in  all  these\r\n\r\nmatters. We, as the Government, are quite  ready\r\n\r\nto  consider  reasonable arguments,  but  we  at\r\n\r\nleast are realists. We stand to be convinced  by\r\n\r\nargument,  not by emotion. So far, Mr  Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I can assure you, speaking from this  side\r\n\r\nof the House, that none of us has been convinced\r\n\r\nthat  there  is  any merit in the representation\r\n\r\nthat has been made by the Member for Tanglin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>\r\n\r\nMr Speaker, Sir, one thing that can be said  of\r\n\r\nthe  hon Member for Tanglin is this: if we  were\r\n\r\nto  listen to him long enough, we would  imagine\r\n\r\nthat  we  are attending a Sunday school  sermon.\r\n\r\nThe only defect is that he did not try to end it\r\n\r\nup with a loud \"Amen\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat surprised at the manner in which\r\n\r\nhe  seems  to  pop  up and down,  attempting  to\r\n\r\nanswer the speeches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof  my colleagues. His example reminds me of the\r\n\r\ngymnasium  which I used to haunt in  my  younger\r\n\r\ndays when I took up boxing, where there was  the\r\n\r\ninevitable punching bag which, although you kept\r\n\r\npunching  it, kept coming back for more punches.\r\n\r\nAt yesterday's sitting of the House, I mentioned\r\n\r\na  very battered rubber stamp. We now see a very\r\n\r\nbattered punching bag!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the five amendments from the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin, he has just raised issues on  four\r\n\r\nof  them,  namely, nominees from  the  Singapore\r\n\r\nTeachers  Union, the Singapore Chinese  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnion,  the  Singapore Head Teachers Conference,\r\n\r\nand the Singapore Chinese Schools Conference. He\r\n\r\nmay  not  be  aware that two  out  of  the  four\r\n\r\nalready  have  nominees serving on  the  highest\r\n\r\neducational advisory body in the State,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  nominees from the Singapore Teachers Union,\r\n\r\nrepresenting  the English stream  of  education,\r\n\r\nand a nominee from the Singapore Chinese Schools\r\n\r\nConference. It is not necessary that the nominee\r\n\r\nor  nominees of organisations should be on every\r\n\r\ncommittee or board. It would be senseless. If we\r\n\r\nwere  to  follow his argument, we might as  well\r\n\r\nhave all the Assemblymen on every board that the\r\n\r\nGovernment sets up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin has suggested that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  a nominee from the Chinese  Teachers\r\n\r\nUnion. May I draw attention to the fact that  in\r\n\r\nJune  last year, as soon as the People's  Action\r\n\r\nParty   took   office,  and  as   Minister   for\r\n\r\nEducation, I had to advise this particular  body\r\n\r\nof  Chinese teachers how undesirable it  was  to\r\n\r\norganise a team of 33 Chinese teachers to  visit\r\n\r\nTaiwan?  So  we  can  safely assume  that  their\r\n\r\npolitical    philosophy,   if   any,    requires\r\n\r\neducation, perhaps lots of adult education, that\r\n\r\nis,  loyalty to Singapore and not to that pimple\r\n\r\non  the  face  of  free Asia, an  island  called\r\n\r\nTaiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the organisation known as the Head\r\n\r\nTeachers  Conference,  perhaps  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nTanglin is a member of this Conference. It is, I\r\n\r\nthink,   unnecessary  that   there   should   be\r\n\r\nclassification of teachers - teachers who teach\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand teachers who administer. So I cannot see the\r\n\r\nnecessity  at  this juncture for  considering  a\r\n\r\nnomination from this particular organisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin mentioned certain assets\r\n\r\nwhich  this new Board would take over. In  these\r\n\r\nassets  he  included sums of  money  donated  by\r\n\r\nprivate   individuals  and  from  the   Colonial\r\n\r\nDevelopment Fund. It is the purpose of a  Select\r\n\r\nCommittee to consider such representations.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin, who was a  Member  of  the\r\n\r\nSelect   Committee   on  the   Lembaga   Gerakan\r\n\r\nPelajaran  Dewasa Bill, is well  aware  that  no\r\n\r\nwritten  representations were  received  by  the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  It can therefore  safely  be\r\n\r\nassumed  that  there have been no loud  protests\r\n\r\nover  this  transfer  of  assets.  So  there  is\r\n\r\ncertainly  no  foundation for  stirring  up  the\r\n\r\nemotions  of  individuals that  the  assets  are\r\n\r\ngoing to be lost to this new Board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further wish to add that if we follow closely\r\n\r\nthe  progress of this Bill, if we, for  example,\r\n\r\nstudy the Official Report of the proceedings  of\r\n\r\nthe  Select  Committee, we will find the  Member\r\n\r\nfor  Tanglin  proposing  that  there  should  be\r\n\r\nnominees  from the National Union  of  Teachers,\r\n\r\nand  having been told that there was no National\r\n\r\nUnion  of Teachers, he then came up at  a  later\r\n\r\nstage with definite names. But he has got to  be\r\n\r\ntaught  how  to  proceed with the amendments  to\r\n\r\nBills. At least, he is willing to learn!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, of\r\n\r\nmaking  an  announcement about the  question  of\r\n\r\nteachers and adult education. When the 4\u00bd hours'\r\n\r\nextra session work was abolished, it was decided\r\n\r\nthat  we  would call for volunteers to  man  the\r\n\r\nadult  and  literacy  classes,  which  will   be\r\n\r\nhandled by this new Adult Education Board. I  am\r\n\r\nvery   pleased  to  be  able  to  announce   the\r\n\r\nwonderful  response from members of the  public,\r\n\r\nthe  teachers and the civil servants. Of course,\r\n\r\nthe  greatest  credit must go to the  400-strong\r\n\r\nMalay  Teachers  Union who  passed  a  unanimous\r\n\r\nresolution to offer their voluntary services  to\r\n\r\nthe   Government.  To  date,  there  are   2,140\r\n\r\nvolunteers  who  include; I am very  pleased  to\r\n\r\nsay, six of my colleagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy  making this announcement, I hope I will  not\r\n\r\nstop  the  response to volunteer, and that  more\r\n\r\nwill come forward because the Government intends\r\n\r\nto  go very much further into the rural areas of\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volunteers are as follows: Chinese, 1,125; Malays, 519, which include the\r\n\r\n400-strong  Malay Teachers Union; English,  472;\r\n\r\nand Tamil, 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, I only need to say this. I am\r\n\r\nunable to take seriously the proposals from  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Tanglin unless he does one  of  two\r\n\r\nthings.  Firstly,  volunteer  to  do  one   year\r\n\r\nservice  for adult education, or become a  pupil\r\n\r\nat  one  of our adult literacy classes and  then\r\n\r\ngive us suggestions for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, some of the\r\n\r\npoints I made have not been answered.

This\r\n\r\nGovernment is not going to be pushed around with\r\n\r\nlast-minute  suggestions coming  from  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember   for   Tanglin.  The  remarks   I   made\r\n\r\npreviously   apply  also  in  respect   of   the\r\n\r\nnomination  from the Malay Education Council  in\r\n\r\nthat   their  nominee  serves  on  that  highest\r\n\r\nadvisory  body  known as the Education  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil,  which meets once a month. The  nominee\r\n\r\nof this Malay Education Council also serves as a\r\n\r\nmember   of   the   Malay   Education   Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee, which advises the Minister  on  Malay\r\n\r\neducation.  It is, I think, superfluous  on  the\r\n\r\npart  of  the  Member  for Tanglin  to  ask  for\r\n\r\nassurances from the Minister for Education  that\r\n\r\nat least a Malay will be appointed on this Adult\r\n\r\nEducation  Board.  It  does  not  require   such\r\n\r\nassurances because the People's Action Party  is\r\n\r\na Party, which believes in action - deeds and not\r\n\r\nwords. When we produce the results of our deeds,\r\n\r\npeople  who have the same beliefs as the  Member\r\n\r\nfor Tanglin get startled. They get ruffled, just\r\n\r\nlike  chickens on the farm when something  takes\r\n\r\nplace.  They  talk of progress  when  they  mean\r\n\r\nretrogression.

Perhaps it is considered that\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  Education Council can be represented\r\n\r\non  other bodies, but not on the Board which  it\r\n\r\nis  proposed to set up in this Bill  which  will\r\n\r\nbecome law in Singapore, and which Will use  the\r\n\r\nMalay language for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister for Education is of the opinion\r\n\r\nthat  Malay  education is of a low  standard,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  emphasize  that  not  only  the\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  U.M.N.O. and  the  Party\r\n\r\nRa'ayat,  but  also  members from  the  People's\r\n\r\nAction  Party  (who  are  the  Government)  have\r\n\r\nserved on the Malay Education Council right from\r\n\r\nits  inception  until today. And  they  play  an\r\n\r\nimportant   part  in  the  task  of  the   Malay\r\n\r\nEducation Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not trying to coax the\r\n\r\nGovernment but merely to bring to the  attention\r\n\r\nof the Government the difficulties, which we are\r\n\r\nnow facing. I feel we may be accused of taking a\r\n\r\ncommunalistic  attitude.  I  do  not   wish   my\r\n\r\narguments to be based on communalism or what  is\r\n\r\nembodied in the Preamble to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Constitution. This is for  the  purpose  of\r\n\r\nfostering and encouraging the Malay language  so\r\n\r\nthat it will become the national language and be\r\n\r\ntaught  to those who are not well versed  in  it\r\n\r\nand  who are eager to learn it. So if there  are\r\n\r\ninstitutions    or    bodies    like    U.M.N.O.\r\n\r\nparticularly, or Party Ra'ayat or other  Parties\r\n\r\nit  may  be that, in the eyes of the Government,\r\n\r\nif  they  are  to  be represented,  this  matter\r\n\r\ncannot be put into practice, on a board on which\r\n\r\nthe Government has full power. I merely wish  to\r\n\r\ndraw  the  attention of the Government to  this,\r\n\r\nbecause  on  numerous  occasions  I  have   been\r\n\r\ncastigated by the Government side who have  said\r\n\r\nthat  language reflects the nation, So  if  this\r\n\r\nsaying could be carried out in practice, it will\r\n\r\nnot  be  a  loss to the Government to appoint  a\r\n\r\nnominee from the Malay Education Council so that\r\n\r\nhe  could  co-operate  with  the  Government  in\r\n\r\nmatters of planning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I appreciate the views\r\n\r\nexpressed  by  the Member of the Opposition  who\r\n\r\nhas  pleaded persistently on behalf of the Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Council. However, on  the  Government\r\n\r\nside,  we  have never looked with contempt  upon\r\n\r\nthe  Malay Education Council, nor have  we  ever\r\n\r\nmade  the  accusation that the struggle  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education  Council  is  communal.  I   am\r\n\r\nsurprised that the Member for Kampong Kembangan,\r\n\r\nin supporting his colleague, constantly repeated\r\n\r\nwhether   he  would  be  accused  of   being   a\r\n\r\ncommunalist champion. Mr Speaker, I am  greatly\r\n\r\nsurprised. Why? A cock that crows lays no  eggs.\r\n\r\nI  think perhaps the reason is this - this is only\r\n\r\nthe   feeling   of  the  Member   for   Kampong\r\n\r\nKembangan. But the Government has never  accused\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Kampong Kernbangan of  being  an\r\n\r\nupholder  of  communalism.  The  Government  has\r\n\r\nnever  accused  anybody on this  issue.  But  we\r\n\r\nalways  remind  them  not to  stir  up  communal\r\n\r\nfeelings,     because    of    the    disastrous\r\n\r\nconsequences.  This  is  what  we  have   always\r\n\r\nreminded  them. I feel, Mr Speaker,  if  people\r\n\r\ncan   boast  of  the  existence  of  the   Malay\r\n\r\nEducation Council,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  will  associate  myself  with  that  sentiment.\r\n\r\nbecause  I  am one of the founder members  of  the\r\n\r\nMalay  Education Council and I have served  on  it\r\n\r\nuntil  today. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I  know  the\r\n\r\nexact  situation of the Council. I also know  that\r\n\r\ntwo  Members from the Opposition side are  serving\r\n\r\nas   committee  members  on  the  Malay  Education\r\n\r\nCouncil  today. I feel Government has already  put\r\n\r\nthe Malay Education Council in the same privileged\r\n\r\nposition  as  the  Singapore Educational  Advisory\r\n\r\nCouncil,  whose function is to advise the Minister\r\n\r\non   matters  affecting  Malay  education  or  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of the Malay language  in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker,  the problem of the  Malay  language\r\n\r\ndoes  not  merely  concern the Malay  people.  The\r\n\r\nMalay   language  has  now  become  the   national\r\n\r\nlanguage. It has become more or less the  property\r\n\r\nof  all those domiciled in Singapore-not just  the\r\n\r\nMalays.  It is not surprising, therefore, that  in\r\n\r\nthe   course  of  advancing  and  developing   the\r\n\r\nnational language; it is not necessary that Malays\r\n\r\nshould  be  represented.  In  some  cases  in  the\r\n\r\nUniversity of Malaya, from what I know,  lecturers\r\n\r\nin  Malay  are not Malays. Therefore, Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nthe  development of the national language does not\r\n\r\nlie  solely  in the hands of the Malays.  What  is\r\n\r\nmore,  Mr Speaker, the Malay language has  become\r\n\r\nthe  national  language. Where there  is  a  will,\r\n\r\nthere  is  a way. We can draw on linguistic  Malay\r\n\r\nexperts  from either the Chinese or other streams.\r\n\r\nAbout  the  absence of a representative  from  the\r\n\r\nMalay Education Council, Mr Speaker. Sir, it does\r\n\r\nnot  follow that it is because the Government  has\r\n\r\nbelittled the Malay Education Council; but, on the\r\n\r\nother  hand, propositions put forward by the Malay\r\n\r\nEducation  Council  have  been  accepted  by   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, who have considered that they  are  in\r\n\r\nthe  interests  of the development  of  the  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  in Singapore. Mr Speaker, if there  are\r\n\r\ncertain  quarters  who  hold  the  view  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  belittles or looks down with  contempt\r\n\r\non the Malay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation Council, that may be because of sinister\r\n\r\nmotives.
