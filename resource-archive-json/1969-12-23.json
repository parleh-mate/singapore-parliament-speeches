Some $69 million have been spent over the last\r\n\r\nnine years in extending sewerage facilities not only\r\n\r\nto  new  industrial and housing estates but also  to\r\n\r\noutlying  areas which hitherto had not been provided\r\n\r\nwith such facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to make modern\r\n\r\nsanitation  available to every home within  economic\r\n\r\nreach.  We will spend approximately $60 million  for\r\n\r\nthe  period 1968-73. To help finance the scheme, the\r\n\r\nWorld  Bank  has agreed to a loan of $18 million  to\r\n\r\nmeet  the foreign exchange component of the sewerage\r\n\r\nprojects, the first time the World Bank\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhas  given a loan for sewerage development  anywhere\r\n\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, the capital and operational costs of\r\n\r\nthe Sewerage Department have not been covered by the\r\n\r\nrevenue  collected. To be quite candid, no one  knew\r\n\r\nwhat  returns we got on expenditure as the sums  had\r\n\r\nnever been worked out. In the course of negotiations\r\n\r\nwith  the World Bank for the loan, the Bank made  it\r\n\r\nclear  that approval of the loan was conditional  on\r\n\r\nthe sewage fees being revised. Further, fees were to\r\n\r\nbe  linked to the volume of water consumed  and  the\r\n\r\nrevenue  by  1972  was  to  be  adequate  to   cover\r\n\r\noperating   expenses   plus  interest   on   capital\r\n\r\namortisation.  It is a cardinal principle  with  the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank that investments must pay their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In compliance with the conditions set out by the\r\n\r\nWorld Bank, it is necessary to raise the charges for\r\n\r\nwater. The increases will be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Domestic users of water will pay an additional\r\n\r\n20  cents  per thousand gallons of metered water  in\r\n\r\naddition to a fee of $2 per fitting per month;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) In the case of non-domestic premises, the\r\n\r\ncharge  will  be  50 cents per thousand  gallons  of\r\n\r\nmetered water;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) In the case of industries utilising water in\r\n\r\ntheir  end-products, meters will be fixed to assess\r\n\r\nthe amount of water used for industrial purposes and\r\n\r\nnot discharged into sewers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These fees will be collected by the Public\r\n\r\nUtilities  Board  on behalf of the  Government.  The\r\n\r\nadditional payments from domestic premises will vary\r\n\r\nbetween  20 cents and $1 per month for more than  55\r\n\r\nper  cent  of the population, while another  30  per\r\n\r\ncent   will  pay  between  $1  and  $2  per   month.\r\n\r\nCommercial and industrial premises will also bear  a\r\n\r\nshare  of the costs, varying from $2.50 to  $15  per\r\n\r\nmonth  in the case of coffee-shops, and $15  to  $75\r\n\r\nper month for the smaller industrial premises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order that the increases in utility charges\r\n\r\nwill  not  be  reflected in poorer  households,  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  exemption  from the  P.U.B. sales  tax  on\r\n\r\nconsumers whose bills are below $10 a month will  be\r\n\r\nextended to those whose bills are below\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$12  a month.

In  spite  of  the increases,  the  return  of\r\n\r\ninvestments in sewerage is expected to  be  no  more\r\n\r\nthan two per cent on capital invested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation to give effect to these increased\r\n\r\ncharges  will  be  introduced  at  this  sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament, and when the Bill is passed  early  next\r\n\r\nyear the increases will take effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is a Christmas\r\n\r\npresent  for the thousands of consumers.

In\r\n\r\nother words, it is only $1.2 million. Will there  be\r\n\r\nfurther  increases later on when the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nprobably   come   here   with  another   Ministerial\r\n\r\nstatement?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member has not been listening with the\r\n\r\nattention that the statement deserves. As I said  in\r\n\r\nmy closing remarks, these increases will take effect\r\n\r\nnext year and therefore he and his friends can spend\r\n\r\ntheir Christmas without undue concern that the water\r\n\r\nbills are going up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the two per cent return, I do not know\r\n\r\nhow  the Member arrived at the figure of a yield  of\r\n\r\n$1.2  million. When I said a two per cent return  on\r\n\r\ncapital,  I  meant  a  two per cent  return  on  the\r\n\r\ncapital that had been spent in all sewerage works in\r\n\r\nthe  past. The Member will agree that this is a very\r\n\r\nlow  return on capital investment. For instance,  if\r\n\r\nyou  were  to  invest money in business,  you  would\r\n\r\nexpect  a  return of at least 20 per cent; but  this\r\n\r\nbeing a public utility, Government had to settle for\r\n\r\na very low rate of return indeed. Of course, I agree\r\n\r\nwith  the Member that this is most unfortunate,  but\r\n\r\nlet  us reflect on the good fortune in the past when\r\n\r\nthese  people  were getting subsidised services.  In\r\n\r\nthe past, as I have said, there was no\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccounting on this score, and what happened was that\r\n\r\nthe  general  tax revenue had gone into meeting  the\r\n\r\nlosses  sustained  by running the  sewerage  system.\r\n\r\nWith  these  new  charges, the  Sewerage  Department\r\n\r\nshould at least no longer be in the red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether there would be further increases or not,\r\n\r\nno one can say. It all depends on a number of things\r\n\r\nwhich  it  is  not  possible to  predict  now.

But the Member for Punggol will recollect that\r\n\r\nthe Sewerage Department was at one time a department\r\n\r\nof  the  former City Council. When the City  Council\r\n\r\nhived  off into different departments with the  main\r\n\r\nutilities  department forming the  Public  Utilities\r\n\r\nBoard, the treasurer then knew what the position was\r\n\r\nand   passed  on  the  Sewerage  Department  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. He was under no illusion that this was a\r\n\r\nlosing proposition. So Government had to carry  this\r\n\r\nbaby,  and this was carried, as I said, out  of  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  tax revenue until we applied for the  World\r\n\r\nBank  loan.

The purpose of\r\n\r\nthe  Act is to safeguard the interests of the public\r\n\r\nwho  deposit funds with finance companies. Since the\r\n\r\ncoming   into   operation  of  the  Act,   companies\r\n\r\ntransacting  financing business have  been  licensed\r\n\r\nand  their operations subject to the supervision and\r\n\r\ncontrol of the Commissioner for Finance Companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recollect that during the Second\r\n\r\nReading  of the Finance Companies Bill in Parliament\r\n\r\nin December 1967, the Minister for Finance explained\r\n\r\nthat  it  was  necessary to pass  the  Bill  without\r\n\r\nreference  to  Select  Committee,  so  that   proper\r\n\r\ncontrol  could be established immediately  to  check\r\n\r\nthe   future  proliferation  of  finance  companies.\r\n\r\nHowever,  the  Minister for Finance  also  indicated\r\n\r\nthat   every   consideration  would  be   given   to\r\n\r\nrepresentations  from  finance  companies  and,   if\r\n\r\nnecessary,  amending  legislation  could  later   be\r\n\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the coming into operation of the Act, the\r\n\r\nFinance  Ministry has received representations  from\r\n\r\nthe  Association of Finance Companies,  the  Finance\r\n\r\nHouse Association of Singapore  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce\r\n\r\non    certain   provisions   of   the   Act.   After\r\n\r\nconsideration  of the views expressed  and  in  the\r\n\r\nlight  of  the  experiences gained in the  last  two\r\n\r\nyears  or  so  in  regulating  and  controlling  the\r\n\r\noperations  of the finance companies,  it  was  felt\r\n\r\nthat  a  comprehensive review of  the  Act  need  be\r\n\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Advisory Committee was then formed for this\r\n\r\npurpose.   This   Committee  was  chaired   by   the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  for  Finance  Companies  and  included\r\n\r\nrepresentatives  from  the two finance  associations\r\n\r\nand  the  Chinese  Chamber of Commerce  as  well  as\r\n\r\nconsultants from the International Monetary Fund. It\r\n\r\nconsidered various memoranda and proposals submitted\r\n\r\nto  it  and held discussions and consultations  with\r\n\r\nthe  Solicitor-General, the Registrar  of  Companies\r\n\r\nand  other Government departments concerned with the\r\n\r\nworking of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of its deliberations, it recommended\r\n\r\ncertain amendments to the Act which are incorporated\r\n\r\nin the amendment Bill now before the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Finance Companies Act,\r\n\r\n1967, by   introducing  a  number   of   unrelated\r\n\r\namendments  designed, in the main, to  alleviate  or\r\n\r\nrelax  the strictness of certain provisions in their\r\n\r\napplication  to the business activities  of  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies.  In  the  task of protecting  depositors'\r\n\r\nfunds, it must be conceded that the profitability of\r\n\r\nfinance companies should not be unduly crippled by\r\n\r\nthe too restrictive provisions. The more important\r\n\r\namendments are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 2 of the Act on the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of \"financing business\". This  amendment\r\n\r\nextends  the  definition of \"financing business\"  to\r\n\r\ninclude   hire-purchase   companies   which   accept\r\n\r\ndeposits from the public. As now defined in the Act,\r\n\r\n\"financing business\" means, in summary, the carrying\r\n\r\non of the dual function of borrowing money from, and\r\n\r\nlending money to, the public, but as hire-purchase\r\n\r\nfinancing by legal definition is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  lending of money, these hire-purchase companies\r\n\r\nhave so far not been brought within the ambit of the\r\n\r\nAct.  Since  it  is the aim of the  Act  to  protect\r\n\r\ndepositors' funds, those companies which  engage  in\r\n\r\nhire-purchase financing, but do not accept  deposits\r\n\r\nfrom  the public, will still not be subject  to  the\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 adds a new section - section 3A - to the\r\n\r\nprincipal Act. This new section restricts the use of\r\n\r\nthe term \"finance company\" or any of its derivatives\r\n\r\nindicating   that  a  company  transacts   financing\r\n\r\nbusiness. Henceforth, the use of the words  \"finance\r\n\r\ncompany\"  will be confined to only finance companies\r\n\r\nlicensed  under this Act in the same manner  as  the\r\n\r\nword \"bank\" is restricted to companies doing banking\r\n\r\nbusiness. This is to avoid confusion and provide the\r\n\r\nmeans to the members of the public to distinguish  a\r\n\r\ncompany  which  is  licensed to carry  on  financing\r\n\r\nbusiness  from  the great number of companies  which\r\n\r\nare  not so licensed, but whose business is akin  to\r\n\r\nthat of \"financing business\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 repeals section 12 of the principal Act\r\n\r\nand substitutes therefor a new section. The existing\r\n\r\nlaw   provides  that  every  finance  company  shall\r\n\r\nmaintain a reserve fund and, before any dividend  is\r\n\r\ndeclared,  it  shall  annually  transfer  a  certain\r\n\r\npercentage  of net profits to reserve to  strengthen\r\n\r\nthe company. This restriction on payment of dividend\r\n\r\nto   shareholders  will  now  be  relaxed,  so  that\r\n\r\nadequate  profits may be left over for  distribution\r\n\r\nto    the    shareholders   to   encourage    equity\r\n\r\nparticipation  in finance companies.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it  is  felt  that smaller finance  companies\r\n\r\nshould  be encouraged to grow faster by building  up\r\n\r\ntheir reserves at the higher rates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, therefore, provides for different\r\n\r\namounts  to be transferred to reserve fund according\r\n\r\nto  the  paid-up capital of the finance  companies.\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n          \r\n\r\nthis purpose, licensed finance companies are divided\r\n\r\ninto two categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) companies whose paid-up capital and reserves\r\n\r\nare  $2  million and above each - these are required\r\n\r\nto transfer to reserve fund at the lower rates;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) companies whose paid-up capital and reserves\r\n\r\nare  less  than $2 million each - these are required\r\n\r\nto transfer to reserve fund at higher rates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 amends section 17 and relaxes the\r\n\r\nrestriction on unsecured loans by raising the  limit\r\n\r\nfor  each  unsecured loan from $1,000 at present  to\r\n\r\n$5,000 so as to enable the finance company to have a\r\n\r\ncertain  amount of \"clean\" lending to those who  are\r\n\r\nconsidered credit-worthy, but the aggregate  of  all\r\n\r\nunsecured loans should not exceed 10 per cent of the\r\n\r\nfinance company's paid-up capital and reserves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new provision has been added imposing a ceiling\r\n\r\non  secured  loans  to any single  borrower  to  not\r\n\r\nexceeding  60  per cent of the paid-up  capital  and\r\n\r\nreserves  of  the  finance company,  but,  with  the\r\n\r\napproval of the Commissioner, this limit of  60  per\r\n\r\ncent  may  be raised to 100 per cent of the  paid-up\r\n\r\ncapital and reserves. The introduction of this limit\r\n\r\nis  to  spread  the risk of lending of  the  finance\r\n\r\ncompany, so that \"all the eggs would not be  put  in\r\n\r\none  basket\",  so to speak, which may  endanger  the\r\n\r\ninterests of depositors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A finance company is prohibited from investing\r\n\r\nmore  than  25 per cent of its paid-up  capital  and\r\n\r\nreserves in any other undertakings. Clause 12 raises\r\n\r\nthis limit to 50 per cent, provided the approval  of\r\n\r\nthe Commissioner is obtained. This serves to improve\r\n\r\nthe  capacity  of finance companies as institutional\r\n\r\ninvestors or, alternatively, it will enable  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  to  participate  in  equities  aimed   at\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law provides that no finance company\r\n\r\nis  permitted  to  acquire  any  immovable  property\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  financing\r\n\r\nbusiness.  While  it is recognised that  channelling\r\n\r\ntoo  large  a  proportion of  depositors'  funds  to\r\n\r\nacquire immovable\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nproperties  may  be  of  adverse  interest  to   the\r\n\r\ndepositors, nonetheless the finance companies should\r\n\r\nnot  be totally prevented from direct investment  in\r\n\r\nimmovable  properties  which offer  an  assured  and\r\n\r\ngrowing  income  and  become  increasingly  popular.\r\n\r\nClause  13, therefore, removes this restriction  and\r\n\r\nallows   a  finance  company  to  acquire  immovable\r\n\r\nproperties up to 25 per cent of its paid-up  capital\r\n\r\nand reserves, and such other additional property as\r\n\r\nmay be approved by the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the foregoing, the scope of the Act has\r\n\r\nbeen  narrowed so that it will not apply to licensed\r\n\r\npawnbrokers whose business is already subject to the\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  the Pawnbrokers Ordinance.  Conversely,\r\n\r\nlicensed  finance  companies  will  be  specifically\r\n\r\nexempted  from  the  operation of  the  Moneylenders\r\n\r\nOrdinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provisions are also incorporated to empower the\r\n\r\nCommissioner   to   compound   offences   and   make\r\n\r\nregulations  to  control advertisements  by  finance\r\n\r\ncompanies.

But  certain   minimum\r\n\r\nstandards and norms must be observed.

The amendments  range\r\n\r\nfrom  exemption from income tax on interest accruing\r\n\r\nto   non-residents  and  on  shipping  profits,   to\r\n\r\nsimplifying    the   commencement   and    cessation\r\n\r\nprovisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of Members, I shall go through the\r\n\r\nBill clause by clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 provides for the Act to come into\r\n\r\noperation from 1st January, 1970.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 is to permit the Comptroller to give\r\n\r\ninformation to the Manager of the Central  Provident\r\n\r\nFund  Board,  where such information is required  by\r\n\r\nthe  latter for the performance of his duties. Under\r\n\r\nthe existing provisions, this is not permissible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for complete exemption from\r\n\r\nincome  tax  on interest from deposits  in  approved\r\n\r\nbanks derived in Singapore by non-residents. Members\r\n\r\nwill  recall  that  in 1967, the  rate  of  tax  was\r\n\r\nreduced  from 40 per cent to 10 per cent on interest\r\n\r\nearned by non-resident depositors in approved banks.\r\n\r\nThe  amendment also provides for exemption from tax,\r\n\r\nof  interest derived on or after 1st January,  1968,\r\n\r\nby  all  persons,  resident  or  non-resident,  from\r\n\r\ndeposits  in  the  Post Office Savings  Bank.  These\r\n\r\nexemptions  are designed to make banks in  Singapore\r\n\r\neven  more  attractive as depositories  for  surplus\r\n\r\nfunds  from outside Singapore and also to  encourage\r\n\r\npeople  to cultivate the saving habit with the  Post\r\n\r\nOffice Savings Bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands, any income remitted from\r\n\r\noutside Singapore to a Singapore resident is subject\r\n\r\nto  tax  in Singapore. Provision is also being  made\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister to exempt from tax income remitted\r\n\r\nfrom  abroad  and received by a person  resident  in\r\n\r\nSingapore where relief is not provided under  double\r\n\r\ntaxation agreements. This will allow flexibility, so\r\n\r\nthat  in  cases  where  the  Minister  considers  it\r\n\r\ndesirable, income received in Singapore from\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nspecified overseas investments may be exempted  from\r\n\r\ntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Act, 1968,\r\n\r\nwas  before  the House last year, it  was  announced\r\n\r\nthat  exemption from income tax would be granted  to\r\n\r\nSingapore-registered   ships.   Clause   4   is   in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  that statement and  the  amendment\r\n\r\nseeks  to  exempt from tax income derived  from  1st\r\n\r\nJanuary,  1969,  from  the operation  of  Singapore-registered ships. This exemption will apply  whether\r\n\r\na  ship  belongs to a Singapore owner  or  an  owner\r\n\r\nresident  outside  Singapore  and  is  designed   to\r\n\r\nencourage  the  registration  of  ships  under   The\r\n\r\nSingapore    flag,   thereby   creating   employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  for our citizens. The  response  from\r\n\r\nmaritime circles has already been encouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides for the repeal of the provisions\r\n\r\nallowing  double  deductions for market  development\r\n\r\nexpenditure.  As  the  Economic  Incentives  Act  is\r\n\r\ncomprehensive, covering a wide range of  incentives,\r\n\r\ndouble  deductions  for market  development  are  no\r\n\r\nlonger necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 alters the existing commencement and\r\n\r\ncessation  provisions which have often  perplexed  a\r\n\r\nnumber of taxpayers in the first one or two years of\r\n\r\nassessment. Under the existing provisions, while for\r\n\r\nthe   first  year  of  the  three-year  commencement\r\n\r\nperiod, the income for tax purposes is the amount of\r\n\r\nincome  in  that  calendar year, in the  second  tax\r\n\r\nyear,  the  income is computed by reference  to  the\r\n\r\nincome  for  one year from the date of commencement,\r\n\r\nresulting in the income for the first twelve  months\r\n\r\nbeing  used as the basis for assessing tax liability\r\n\r\nin  the first two years. The taxpayer, however, gets\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the cessation provision by which  in\r\n\r\nthe  year  during which he ceases receiving  income,\r\n\r\nhis tax is not based on the full earnings during the\r\n\r\npreceding  year, but on his actual earnings  in  the\r\n\r\nyear of cessation. In addition, the income from  one\r\n\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  two  preceding  years  is  relieved  from  tax.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not generally appreciated and there\r\n\r\nis  a  general  misconception  that  when  a  person\r\n\r\ncommences employment he is taxed twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed amendment, the income assessed\r\n\r\nfor  any  year  of assessment shall always  be  that\r\n\r\nearned   in  the  preceding  year,  e.g.,  a  person\r\n\r\ncommencing  employment in 1970 will only  be  liable\r\n\r\nfor  tax in 1971 based on his 1970 income. This will\r\n\r\nallow  for  a  straightforward  computation  of  tax\r\n\r\nliability  and, at the same time, curb manipulations\r\n\r\nresulting   in   loss  of  revenue   by   artificial\r\n\r\ncommencements and cessations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the proposed amendment, by which in\r\n\r\neach  year a person is liable for tax based  on  his\r\n\r\nactual income in the preceding year, is simpler  and\r\n\r\nmore easily understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transitional provisions have been made, so that\r\n\r\nthose  who  have  been  liable  to  tax  under   the\r\n\r\ncommencement provisions will still have the  benefit\r\n\r\nof  the old cessation provisions. All taxpayers  who\r\n\r\ncommence  their trade, business or employment  after\r\n\r\n1st  January, 1969, will be assessed under  the  new\r\n\r\npreceding-year  basis. Those who have  already  paid\r\n\r\ntax in 1969 and who commenced employment or trade in\r\n\r\n1969 will be subject to tax in 1970 but the tax paid\r\n\r\nin  1969  will  be credited against their  1970  tax\r\n\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 is a consequential amendment arising from\r\n\r\nthe  repeal  of  the old commencement and  cessation\r\n\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 is aimed at restricting the carry-forward\r\n\r\nof   losses  to  such  cases  where  the  beneficial\r\n\r\nshareholders to whom the carry-forward of losses  is\r\n\r\nto be allowed are substantially the same as those in\r\n\r\nthe  company which incurred the losses. This  is  to\r\n\r\nprevent  abuses  resulting  from  the  purchase   by\r\n\r\nunrelated   persons   of   companies   which    have\r\n\r\nsubstantial losses in order to derive tax benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 repeals the existing law which provides\r\n\r\nfor  tax  at  the  rate of 10 per cent  on  interest\r\n\r\nreceived by non-residents from deposits in approved\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbanks,  as  the  new provisions in  clause  3  allow\r\n\r\ncomplete exemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 deals with the manner in which interest\r\n\r\nfrom tax-free bonds and stocks is dealt with for tax\r\n\r\npurposes,   where  the  recipients  are  banks   and\r\n\r\nfinancial  institutions.  Since  such  organisations\r\n\r\nreceive  the  interest as trading receipts  and  are\r\n\r\nallowed to deduct, as expenses, the cost incurred in\r\n\r\nthe garnering of funds, etc., the credit allowed  is\r\n\r\none-half  of  the  tax on the income  from  interest\r\n\r\nwhich is brought to charge for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 13 are provisions which require the\r\n\r\nremaining  partners  in a partnership  to  keep  the\r\n\r\nComptroller  informed where any partner  is  leaving\r\n\r\nthe   partnership  or  leaving  the   country.   The\r\n\r\nremaining  partners  are made  liable  for  the  tax\r\n\r\npayable  by  any person who ceases to be  a  partner\r\n\r\nwhere  moneys have been paid to an outgoing  partner\r\n\r\nwithout  the  written permission of the Comptroller.\r\n\r\nThis  is  to tighten up on possible avenues for  tax\r\n\r\nevasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 allows the Comptroller to raise advance\r\n\r\nassessments where a person's source of income ceases\r\n\r\nor when he is about to leave the country. This is  a\r\n\r\nprocedural  amendment which is necessary to  prevent\r\n\r\ntax  losses, taking into account the repeal  of  the\r\n\r\nold cessation provisions and the introduction of the\r\n\r\nstrict preceding-year basis of assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 is to permit the Comptroller to withhold\r\n\r\nthe refund of any tax collected until the matter has\r\n\r\nbeen  finally determined in the Courts of  law  with\r\n\r\nprovision  for interest to be paid on the amount  so\r\n\r\nwithheld.  This would safeguard revenue and  prevent\r\n\r\ntaxpayers  from being able to obtain refund  of  tax\r\n\r\nwhich  the  Comptroller may not be able  to  recover\r\n\r\nwhen  the case is finally decided in favour  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 lists the stocks and bonds which are tax-free at the date of publication of the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.05 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it, is interesting to note the\r\n\r\nnumber of items on today's Order Paper which are of\r\n\r\ndirect relevance to the commercial sector. All of\r\n\r\nthese items, particularly the important Bill\r\n\r\ncurrently before us, when implemented, will have the\r\n\r\neffect of helping to rationalise and liberalise\r\n\r\ncertain vital aspects of our commercial activities.\r\n\r\nIt illustrates to my mind very clearly that in\r\n\r\nemphasising the importance of industrialisation, the\r\n\r\nGovernment has not overlooked the need to assist\r\n\r\nconstantly in raising the standard of our\r\n\r\ntraditional commercial activities in order to keep\r\n\r\npace with changes and to maintain our position as a\r\n\r\nleading international business centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before us is an excellent example of what\r\n\r\nthe  Government can do to provide the private sector\r\n\r\nwith  wider  scope  of operation.  I  have  in  mind\r\n\r\nclauses 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 concerns the banking industry and I hope\r\n\r\nthat  with  the official encouragement now provided,\r\n\r\nour  banks  will proceed to attract more money  from\r\n\r\nabroad to be deposited in Singapore and, perhaps  in\r\n\r\ntime,  we shall rival Switzerland in this particular\r\n\r\narea  of  international  banking  service.  In  this\r\n\r\nregard, we have two very salient points, namely, our\r\n\r\nstrong currency system and political stability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 concerns the shipping industry and is\r\n\r\npart  and parcel of the incentives promised  by  the\r\n\r\nMinister  for Communications to encourage a  greater\r\n\r\nnumber of merchant ships to fly our flag. Since  the\r\n\r\nofficial  announcement of the Government's intention\r\n\r\nto  introduce  such  facilities, I  understand  that\r\n\r\nconsiderable  interest has been  aroused  the  world\r\n\r\nover and there have been many inquiries from abroad.\r\n\r\nI  feel sure that with the passing into law of  this\r\n\r\nparticular  amendment to the Income  Tax  Ordinance,\r\n\r\nand a host of other advantages which are already  in\r\n\r\nexistence,  such  as the strategic position  of  our\r\n\r\nport,  the  highly  developed port  facilities,  and\r\n\r\nfacilities  for  ship-repairing and maintenance,  we\r\n\r\nshall  soon  see an influx of applications  for  the\r\n\r\nregistration of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsea-going   vessels  in  Singapore,   resulting   in\r\n\r\nexpanded  employment  opportunities  for  our  young\r\n\r\npeople  who  may  be interested in  seafaring  as  a\r\n\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Finance has time and again\r\n\r\ndemonstrated that, be it in the industrial sector or\r\n\r\nthe  commercial  sector, he is always  prepared  and\r\n\r\nwilling, within reason, to offer incentives  in  the\r\n\r\nform of tax concessions to encourage development  or\r\n\r\nexpansion which will be of ultimate benefit  to  the\r\n\r\ncountry.  But  the  success  or  failure   of   such\r\n\r\nincentives  to  achieve the desired  effect  depends\r\n\r\nlargely   upon   the   initiative,   ingenuity   and\r\n\r\ndetermination  that  can  be  exercised   by   those\r\n\r\nconcerned in the private sector.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.10 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the amendments\r\n\r\nproposed  in the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill.  I  am\r\n\r\nonly  surprised  that this amendment  Bill  was  not\r\n\r\nintroduced   earlier.  To  take  one  example,   the\r\n\r\ncommencement and cessation provisions of the  Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance,  which are as  confusing  as  modern\r\n\r\nabstract  paintings, have led to  confusion  amongst\r\n\r\nlaymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA  wage-earner cannot understand why if he commences\r\n\r\nemployment  in December in any year he  has  to  pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax  for two years in January  of  the  next\r\n\r\nyear. He has hardly worked for more than a month and\r\n\r\nhas  only  been paid one month's wages,  yet  he  is\r\n\r\nliable  to pay income tax for the first year on  the\r\n\r\nmonth  of  December,  and for  the  second  year  of\r\n\r\nassessment,  from  December of  the  first  year  to\r\n\r\nNovember of the next year. I therefore welcome  this\r\n\r\namendment   Bill   and  note   with   even   greater\r\n\r\nsatisfaction that those of us who have already  been\r\n\r\nhit,  like  myself,  by  double  taxation  when   we\r\n\r\ncommenced  employment will be given a  reduction  in\r\n\r\nincome tax when we cease employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that many big business companies\r\n\r\nhave taken advantage of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  commencement and cessation provisions to  avoid\r\n\r\npaying  income  tax.  This has  been  going  on  for\r\n\r\nseveral  years and the Government has, as a  result,\r\n\r\nlost  several million dollars. May I inquire whether\r\n\r\naction can be taken to recoup these losses?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.12 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the\r\n\r\nParliamentary  Secretary on  introducing  this  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  is a fair and progressive measure. It clearly\r\n\r\nshows that we have a very healthy economic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the amendments were introduced, the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Ordinance was rather confusing but  now  it  is\r\n\r\nmore reasonable. Income tax will now be based on the\r\n\r\nincome derived in the preceding year, and the tax to\r\n\r\nbe  paid  next  year  will be based  on  the  income\r\n\r\nderived this year. I believe that all taxpayers will\r\n\r\nbe satisfied with this arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, where does this fair and equitable taxation\r\n\r\npolicy  come  from?  We  know  that  our  Government\r\n\r\npractises  democratic socialism. We  often  need  to\r\n\r\nemphasise that it is our noble aim to build  a  more\r\n\r\nfair and more equitable society. In order to achieve\r\n\r\nthis  aim,  we  must lay down a fair and  reasonable\r\n\r\ntaxation policy. We must specify that the rich  will\r\n\r\nbear  a greater part of the tax burden and the  poor\r\n\r\nwill be exempted from income tax. It is only through\r\n\r\nthis  progressive  policy that  we  can  realise  an\r\n\r\negalitarian society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that a healthy and progressive taxation\r\n\r\npolicy  will promote the development of our  economy\r\n\r\nand  improve  the  prosperity of  the  country.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the Bill provides that ships registered  in\r\n\r\nour country as well as deposits which are put in our\r\n\r\nbanks  by  foreigners will be exempted  from  income\r\n\r\ntax.  I  think  this  will  encourage  more  foreign\r\n\r\ncapital to be invested in our country. Once we  have\r\n\r\ngot  hold of these investments they will be used  to\r\n\r\nfinance  the various activities of our commerce  and\r\n\r\nindustry. This will also encourage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 273</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmore  ships to be registered in our country. In this\r\n\r\nway,  our  economy will improve and more  employment\r\n\r\nopportunities  will be created. Therefore,  we  must\r\n\r\nmaintain a progressive economic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendment Bill mainly looks\r\n\r\nafter the interests of the rich and big enterprises.\r\n\r\nNaturally  I  support  this  Bill  because   it   is\r\n\r\nbeneficial to our economy. But I would like to  take\r\n\r\nthis opportunity to remind the Minister that he must\r\n\r\nalso  look after the interests of the working class.\r\n\r\nFor example, we should reduce the property tax rates\r\n\r\non  Housing  Board flats in order  to  reduce  their\r\n\r\nburden.  All  in  all,  this  amendment  Bill  is  a\r\n\r\nprogressive and equitable measure. I support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.15 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill makes several important\r\n\r\nand   desirable   amendments  to  our   Income   Tax\r\n\r\nOrdinance. Like the Member for Bras Basah, I am also\r\n\r\nsurprised that these amendments were not thought  of\r\n\r\nvery much earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, tax exemption is to be given in\r\n\r\nrespect of interest derived in Singapore by  a  non-resident  individual.  This will  encourage  him  to\r\n\r\nleave  his  money here instead of taking it  out  of\r\n\r\nSingapore for investment abroad. I am also  glad  to\r\n\r\nknow that such exemption is to be back-dated to 20th\r\n\r\nAugust, 1968.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see that the Minister will be\r\n\r\ngiven  the  power  to  exempt from  tax  any  income\r\n\r\nreceived   in   Singapore   from   sources   outside\r\n\r\nSingapore.  But  there is a proviso which  specifies\r\n\r\nthat  this  outside source must come from a  country\r\n\r\nwith which there is no arrangement for the avoidance\r\n\r\nof  double taxation. I would be interested  to  know\r\n\r\nhow  many and which are the countries that Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  made  arrangements with for  the  avoidance  of\r\n\r\ndouble taxation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand we have such an arrangement with\r\n\r\nAustralia.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we are getting  closer\r\n\r\nand  closer  to  Australia in many fields,  such  as\r\n\r\ntrade  and  investment.  Any  Singaporean  who   has\r\n\r\nconsiderable assets in Australia will\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnot  bring back to Singapore the income derived from\r\n\r\nthese  assets, because if he does so he has  to  pay\r\n\r\nincome  tax  in  Singapore.  Hence,  he  leaves  his\r\n\r\nassets,  whatever  they may be, in  Australia.  What\r\n\r\nthen  is the benefit to Singapore? We should be much\r\n\r\nhappier  if  this  particular  amendment  could   be\r\n\r\nfurther amended by the deletion of the proviso  that\r\n\r\nlimits  the Minister's powers of exemption  only  to\r\n\r\ncountries with which Singapore does not have  double\r\n\r\ntaxation agreements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank those Members who\r\n\r\nspoke  in support of this Bill. They have all spoken\r\n\r\nvery  well  of our economic policies,  and  I  think\r\n\r\nSingapore justly deserves to be the financial centre\r\n\r\nof  this  part of the world. The provisions in  this\r\n\r\namendment Bill are, in fact, making this possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think two Members complained that certain\r\n\r\nprovisions, like the provisions for commencement and\r\n\r\ncessation, were not introduced earlier. My reply  is\r\n\r\nthat  it  is  better  late than never.  Anyway,  the\r\n\r\npresent  provisions for commencement  and  cessation\r\n\r\nare   straightforward  and   would   not   lead   to\r\n\r\nmisunderstanding by taxpayers that  they  are  taxed\r\n\r\ntwice in the year of commencement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Bras Basah wants an\r\n\r\nassurance  from  me that the present  taxpayers  who\r\n\r\ncommenced  business or employment before the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  force of the Act would get the benefit of  the\r\n\r\nold  cessation provision. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  can\r\n\r\ngive  this  categorical assurance. In  fact,  it  is\r\n\r\nprovided  in  the  Bill  that  those  who  commenced\r\n\r\nbusiness or employment before the coming into  force\r\n\r\nof  this  Act  would  get  the  benefit  when  their\r\n\r\nbusiness or employment ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah is labouring under\r\n\r\nsome  misapprehension.  The  proviso  in  clause   3\r\n\r\nclearly  states  that  the Minister  will  have  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion to exempt from tax income from  countries\r\n\r\nwith which we have no double taxation agreement. But\r\n\r\nwhere   there   is  a  double  taxation   agreement,\r\n\r\nprovision\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nis  made normally for the exemption of tax on income\r\n\r\nwhen  it  is  remitted  back to  Singapore,  because\r\n\r\nincome  is normally taxed at the place where  it  is\r\n\r\nearned. The whole idea of double taxation agreements\r\n\r\nis  that  they will not be taxed twice. For example,\r\n\r\nif  profits  are earned in Australia, the Australian\r\n\r\nGovernment  will have the primary right to  tax  the\r\n\r\nprofits.    Normally,   without   double    taxation\r\n\r\nagreements,  when the profits are remitted  back  to\r\n\r\nSingapore,  the  Singapore  Government   will   also\r\n\r\nexercise  the  right to tax such  profits.  However,\r\n\r\nunder   a  double  taxation  agreement  with,   say,\r\n\r\nAustralia,  it  is normally provided that  once  the\r\n\r\nprofits  are taxed in Australia, they are not  taxed\r\n\r\nagain when they are remitted back to Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nproviso in clause 3, however, gives the Minister the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  exempt profits from tax  where  such\r\n\r\nprofits  derived from countries with which Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  no double taxation agreement are remitted  back\r\n\r\nto Singapore. That is the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the remark made by the Member for\r\n\r\nSembawang that the provisions of this Bill are  only\r\n\r\nfor  the rich. I say that it is not true. If he will\r\n\r\nremember  that an ordinary wage-earner,  who  has  a\r\n\r\nwife  and two children and earning less than $500  a\r\n\r\nmonth is not subject to tax, he will not make such a\r\n\r\ncomplaint;   he   will  realise  that   the   P.A.P.\r\n\r\nGovernment  is  a  socialist one and  does  not  tax\r\n\r\nworkers with a small income.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also touched on the question of\r\n\r\nproperty  tax. I am very happy to announce  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse  that  the  Government has decided  to  reduce\r\n\r\nproperty  tax  for  all owner-occupiers  of  Housing\r\n\r\nBoard  flats to the uniform rate of 23 per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe    annual   value.   This   again   is   another\r\n\r\nmanifestation   of   the  Government's   policy   to\r\n\r\nencourage  people  to own their  own  homes  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate a stable and prosperous society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill.- [Mr Tang See Chim].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

Members  will   note   that   these\r\n\r\nrepresentations  were made only in  respect  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond  part  of the Bill, namely, the  Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil. Oral evidence was heard by the Committee in\r\n\r\nrespect of one representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No major amendments have been recommended by the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee.  In respect of  the  first  part,\r\n\r\nArticle  52D  has  been  redrafted  because  it  was\r\n\r\nthought  that  the requirement that one  must  be  a\r\n\r\ncitizen  before he can be appointed a Judge  of  the\r\n\r\nHigh    Court   may   exclude   otherwise   suitable\r\n\r\ncandidates.  The  other change is the  insertion  of\r\n\r\nclause  (10)  to Article 52F wherein it is  provided\r\n\r\nthat  the  President may, in his  discretion,  grant\r\n\r\nleave  to the Chief Justice and the other Judges  of\r\n\r\nthe High Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the Bill sets out more radical\r\n\r\nprovisions and only one minor amendment thereto  has\r\n\r\nbeen  recommended -- a purely drafting amendment  to\r\n\r\nArticle 81M (5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that the Constitutional\r\n\r\nCommission  on  minority rights had recommended  the\r\n\r\ncreation  of  the  Presidential  Council  and   that\r\n\r\nGovernment  had  accepted this  recommendation.  The\r\n\r\nmain function of this Council would be to offer such\r\n\r\nassistance  by  way  of  counsel  and  advice   upon\r\n\r\nlegislation, including subsidiary legislation,  that\r\n\r\nmight   have   provisions   which   conflict    with\r\n\r\nfundamental   rights  and  liberties   of   minority\r\n\r\ninterests  in the State. It is hoped, as well,  that\r\n\r\nthe   Council   would  provide  the  Government   or\r\n\r\nParliament  with such advice as may be  sought  from\r\n\r\nit,  on  any matter relating to the safeguarding  of\r\n\r\nrights or liberties belonging to certain sections of\r\n\r\nour   community,  whether  they  relate  to  racial,\r\n\r\nreligious  or  other matters. While recognising  its\r\n\r\nusefulness,  the Government has also  provided  such\r\n\r\nmeasures  in  the Bill as to ensure the  legislative\r\n\r\nsupremacy of Parliament. We have endowed the Council\r\n\r\nwith  the  authority and status to  make  its  views\r\n\r\nknown  and  felt on all those matters  I  have  just\r\n\r\nreferred to.

It  is to be hoped that its  contribution\r\n\r\nwould  always  be directed towards the consolidation\r\n\r\nand not the disruption and weakening of the State. I\r\n\r\ncannot  help  feeling, however,  that  some  of  the\r\n\r\ncurious features in this amendment Bill would add  a\r\n\r\nfew  more  legal conundrums to the as yet unresolved\r\n\r\nproblem  posed  by  Articles  52  and  90   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also questionable if the two-thirds majority\r\n\r\nin  Parliament  needed to overcome a report  by  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  that a proposed piece of legislation  is  a\r\n\r\ndifferentiating  measure or  otherwise  inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith  the fundamental liberties of the subject could\r\n\r\nnot  be  negatived  and overcome by  the  device  of\r\n\r\nintroducing a constitutional amendment in Parliament\r\n\r\nrequiring  only  a bare majority under  Article  90,\r\n\r\nRule     1.    Further,    subsidiary    legislation\r\n\r\ncharacterised  by  the Council as a  differentiating\r\n\r\nmeasure   or   otherwise   inconsistent   with   the\r\n\r\nfundamental  liberties  of the  subject  could  also\r\n\r\nremain  in the statute book as enforceable  law  for\r\n\r\nsix months before appropriate measures of revocation\r\n\r\nare  taken. I hope, however, that it is not too much\r\n\r\nto  expect  that  more careful and elegant  drafting\r\n\r\nwould  be a feature of the new Constitution that  we\r\n\r\nare to have in due course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Constitution\r\n\r\n(Amendment)  Bill. I wish to touch upon  the  second\r\n\r\npart  of  the Bill, namely, the Presidential Council\r\n\r\nand  matters related thereto. When the Bill was read\r\n\r\na  Second  time in Parliament, I remember I  made  a\r\n\r\nstatement   supporting  the  setting   up   of   the\r\n\r\nPresidential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCouncil.  In my opinion, I regard it as  the  second\r\n\r\nmost progressive measure ever taken by Parliament in\r\n\r\nthe  history  of  our parliamentary  democracy.  The\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  took  into consideration  various\r\n\r\nmatters,  including  procedural,  relating  to   the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council.  The  Government  is  to   be\r\n\r\npraised  for exercising care in the introduction  of\r\n\r\nthis  Bill  and its passage through all its  stages.\r\n\r\nFor  instance, there is a provision stipulating that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the Council should be people  above  35\r\n\r\nyears of age. This will enable people who are mature\r\n\r\nand  knowledgeable to be appointed as  members.  The\r\n\r\nBill also provides that people of unsound mind shall\r\n\r\nbe  disqualified for appointment as members  of  the\r\n\r\nCouncil. These provisions are very appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee also gave careful\r\n\r\nconsideration to the various details  in  the  Bill.\r\n\r\nThe  Presidential Council's main function is to  see\r\n\r\nthat  there is no discriminatory measure in all  our\r\n\r\nlegislation  against the minority  groups.  In  this\r\n\r\nway,  various opinions and views can be advanced  so\r\n\r\nthat  the  Government can take a judicious stand  in\r\n\r\nits  policies  for  the people's  benefit.  In  this\r\n\r\nrespect, the Government has set up community centres\r\n\r\nand citizens' consultative committees throughout the\r\n\r\nRepublic to look after the interest of the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  and  also  to  assess  their  views  and\r\n\r\nopinions  so  as  to  help  the  Government  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation of its policies. We all know that  in\r\n\r\ndictatorial countries, the authorities do  not  like\r\n\r\nfreedom  of  expression for the people.  They  would\r\n\r\nlike  to  shut them up. But this is not a  judicious\r\n\r\npolicy.  There is a Chinese saying that it  is  more\r\n\r\ndifficult  to shut up the people than  to  stop  the\r\n\r\nflow  of  a river. This is something that cannot  be\r\n\r\ncontrolled.   We   must  develop   the   spirit   of\r\n\r\nparliamentary  democracy.  In  this   respect,   the\r\n\r\nsetting  up of the Presidential Council will  afford\r\n\r\nan  opportunity  for  people who have  distinguished\r\n\r\nthemselves in public service or attained eminence in\r\n\r\ntheir respective walks of life to contribute  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntheir part in nation-building for the  benefit\r\n\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the appointment of members of the\r\n\r\nCouncil,  I  would  like to make  some  suggestions.\r\n\r\nFirst,   the   Council   should   be   composed   of\r\n\r\nrepresentatives of various races in various walks of\r\n\r\nlife. Second, the members of the Council should come\r\n\r\nfrom the four streams of education. They should  not\r\n\r\ncome  from only one stream of education. As  we  are\r\n\r\nimplementing  the  policy of  multi-lingualism,  the\r\n\r\nCouncil  should conduct its proceedings in the  four\r\n\r\nofficial languages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, can the Minister say when this\r\n\r\nPresidential  Council will be set up? Two  or  three\r\n\r\nyears  have  elapsed since the  setting  up  of  the\r\n\r\nConstitutional Commission. As ours is  an  efficient\r\n\r\ngovernment, every kind of work should be efficiently\r\n\r\ncarried  out. The people of Singapore would like  to\r\n\r\nknow when the Presidential Council can be set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, after hearing the speech of the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang, I feel that certain parts  of\r\n\r\nhis speech are worth listening to. For instance, the\r\n\r\nConstitution (Amendment) Bill represents a  symbolic\r\n\r\nstep  in Parliament. But he has not said why  it  is\r\n\r\nso.   If  we  look  up  the  political  history   of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  we  can  see  that  there  is  a   great\r\n\r\ndifference in the present Constitution of  Singapore\r\n\r\ncompared  to the Singapore (Constitution)  Order  in\r\n\r\nCouncil, 1958. From there we can see where  we  have\r\n\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill has been introduced in the House\r\n\r\ntogether   with   the   Criminal   Procedure    Code\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill. The Constitution (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nis   on  constitutional  matters  and  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code  (Amendment)  Bill  is  on  judicial\r\n\r\nmatters. With their passage, we can see that we have\r\n\r\nprogressed  constitutionally as well as in  criminal\r\n\r\nprocedural law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we debated the Criminal Procedure Code\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill yesterday, we heard that there  was\r\n\r\na person who held a public rally at Fullerton Square\r\n\r\nagainst  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Bukit\r\n\r\nMerah has deviated in his speech on the Constitution\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill. He is referring to the rally  held\r\n\r\nat Fullerton Square which has no relationship at all\r\n\r\nwith the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Sembawang must appreciate that I am\r\n\r\nlistening  to  the  Member for Bukit  Merah  in  the\r\n\r\nspirit of the season. Mr Lim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Perhaps the Member for Sembawang is too impatient.\r\n\r\nI  was  about  to refer to the Bill now  before  the\r\n\r\nHouse. Just now I was talking about a certain person\r\n\r\nwho  held a public rally at Fullerton Square against\r\n\r\nthe Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill. But we\r\n\r\nhave not seen anybody holding a public rally against\r\n\r\nthe Constitution (Amendment) Bill. Perhaps there  is\r\n\r\nan   explanation  in  that  not  many   people   are\r\n\r\ninterested  in  the setting up of  the  Presidential\r\n\r\nCouncil.  There  is  another view  that  this  is  a\r\n\r\ndemocratic process which is easily understood by all\r\n\r\npeople  and that there need not be any hue  and  cry\r\n\r\nagainst  it. Furthermore, the Bill would be able  to\r\n\r\npresent  a  kind of democratic spirit. This  is  an\r\n\r\nhonour   that  Parliament  has  achieved.   However,\r\n\r\nwithout  the setting up of the Presidential Council,\r\n\r\nit  does  not  mean  that our  Constitution  is  not\r\n\r\ndemocratic or up to date. The point is that with the\r\n\r\nintroduction of the Bill, our Constitution can  cope\r\n\r\nwith  more comprehensive matters and in wider  scope\r\n\r\ntouching on the interest of minority groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Singapore is multi-racial, it is very\r\n\r\nnecessary to look after the interests and  needs  of\r\n\r\nthe   minority  groups.  Article  89  (1)   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution of Singapore is a provision relating to\r\n\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrights  of  the minorities. Even before we  achieved\r\n\r\nour  present  stage of progress in our Constitution,\r\n\r\nthe Government had already taken care of the welfare\r\n\r\nand  interest of the minorities. With this amendment\r\n\r\nBill,   we  can  improve  the  provisions   of   the\r\n\r\nConstitution  so  as to look after  their  interests\r\n\r\nbetter. The Presidential Council can assess opinions\r\n\r\nand  views from various quarters and put their heads\r\n\r\ntogether to consider any legislation which might  be\r\n\r\na  discriminating measure. This is in  keeping  with\r\n\r\nour  democratic  practice. This will  cut  down  any\r\n\r\npossibility  of dictatorial measures in legislation.\r\n\r\nIn  this  context, I must say that the Bill and  its\r\n\r\nprovisions are very appropriate at this time.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.28 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may first deal with the\r\n\r\nMember  for  Sembawang. He wants to  know  when  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council will be set up. The  answer  is\r\n\r\nnext  year.  How early next year I do not  know.  It\r\n\r\ntakes  a  lot of administrative work to get  such  a\r\n\r\nCouncil  on  to  its  feet. But perhaps  the  Member\r\n\r\nhimself is anxious to get on the Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Panjang questioned whether\r\n\r\nthe provision in Article 81K (6) (c) of the Bill  is\r\n\r\nnot  inconsistent  with or illogical  when  compared\r\n\r\nwith  the  present  Article 90 of  our  Constitution\r\n\r\nrelating  to  constitutional  amendments.  He   also\r\n\r\nreferred to Article 52 which says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Any law enacted by the Legislature after the\r\n\r\ncoming into operation of this Constitution which  is\r\n\r\ninconsistent  with this Constitution shall,  to  the\r\n\r\nextent of the inconsistency, be void.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 90 (1) provides that:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The provisions of this Constitution may be\r\n\r\namended by a law enacted by the Legislature.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the law now stands, the Constitution may\r\n\r\nbe  amended  by a simple majority, as laid  down  in\r\n\r\nArticle  90. But Article 81K clause (6) (c)  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  requires  a two-thirds majority  in  order  to\r\n\r\novercome any adverse opinion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof the Council to the effect that a provision in the\r\n\r\nproposed   law   is   a   differentiating    measure\r\n\r\ninconsistent with the fundamental liberties  of  the\r\n\r\nsubjects.  Members will agree that it  is  only  but\r\n\r\nright  that we should have this provision  in  order\r\n\r\nthat  Parliament may not, without such  a  majority,\r\n\r\nabrogate  these  fundamental liberties  if,  in  the\r\n\r\nopinion  of the Council, a Bill would have such  ill\r\n\r\neffects.  Any  suggestion that  the  requirement  in\r\n\r\nArticle  81K clause (6) (c) might be overcome  by  a\r\n\r\nwithdrawal  and  re-submission of  such  a  proposed\r\n\r\nmeasure  as the Constitution (Amendment) Bill  would\r\n\r\nbe  quite incorrect. Such a Constitution (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill would again have to obtain the clearance of the\r\n\r\nPresidential Council so that any such Bill which  in\r\n\r\nthe   opinion  of  the  Council  adversely   affects\r\n\r\nfundamental rights or liberties may not be passed by\r\n\r\nParliament without a two-thirds majority.  There  is\r\n\r\nreally  nothing inconsistent with the constitutional\r\n\r\namendment  provisions. The effects of the particular\r\n\r\nclause would be to ensure further the protection  of\r\n\r\nthese fundamental rights or liberties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to ask the Minister some\r\n\r\nquestions and would also like him to clarify certain\r\n\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The\r\n\r\nCommittee  decided to incorporate certain amendments\r\n\r\nbased  on  some  of  the points brought  up  in  the\r\n\r\nmemoranda as well as in oral evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no change in the basic purposes of the\r\n\r\nBill was deemed necessary. The basic aim of the Bill\r\n\r\nis to reform and liberalise the abortion law so that\r\n\r\nwomen  with unwanted pregnancies may, on social  and\r\n\r\nhumanitarian  grounds  as well  as  on  medical  and\r\n\r\neugenic   considerations,  have  their   pregnancies\r\n\r\nterminated   safely   and   cheaply   in    approved\r\n\r\ninstitutions and by approved doctors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was expected, there were written submissions\r\n\r\nwhich  argue  on  the principles  of  the  Bill.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse, the stand\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ntaken depended upon whether the individual person or\r\n\r\nthe  organisation which made the representation  was\r\n\r\nfor or against the principle of treatment by way  of\r\n\r\na  deliberate act to terminate pregnancy. Some  took\r\n\r\ntheir  stand  in  accordance with  their  particular\r\n\r\nreligious  persuasion, although they of  course  did\r\n\r\nnot  want openly to admit it. There were also  other\r\n\r\nsubmissions  which proposed amendments  to  specific\r\n\r\nprovisions  of  the Bill. Often the  representations\r\n\r\ntook  the  form of the first part being  devoted  to\r\n\r\narguments on principle and, in the latter  part,  to\r\n\r\npropose  specific  amendments to  the  Bill.  It  is\r\n\r\ninteresting  to note that there were also  memoranda\r\n\r\nwhich,  in  the first instance, argued  against  the\r\n\r\nprinciple  of  the  liberalisation  of  the  law  of\r\n\r\nabortion, but later went on to propose amendments to\r\n\r\nspecific  provisions  of  the  Bill,  presumably  to\r\n\r\nimprove it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the issues raised in the submissions\r\n\r\npertaining to the principles of the Bill were indeed\r\n\r\nfamiliar ground as these had already been covered by\r\n\r\narguments  for and against the Bill which  had  been\r\n\r\nraised  before the Bill was presented to  Parliament\r\n\r\nand which were exhaustively debated in Parliament at\r\n\r\nthe  Second Reading of the Bill. I can say that, all\r\n\r\nin   all,  with  a  few  exceptions,  most  of   the\r\n\r\nrepresentations were agreed that there was a need to\r\n\r\nreform  and liberalise our law of abortion, although\r\n\r\nthere was disagreement on specific provisions of the\r\n\r\nBill  and their wording and how far we should go  in\r\n\r\nliberalising it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the representations, the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee  decided  upon certain amendments  to  the\r\n\r\nBill.  But  I  wish  to emphasise  here  that  these\r\n\r\namendments to the Bill will in no way alter the aims\r\n\r\nand objectives of the Bill or deviate from the basic\r\n\r\nconsiderations   which  had  made   the   Government\r\n\r\nintroduce  the Bill. Neither would they in  any  way\r\n\r\nweaken  the  Bill  as  had  been  suggested  in  one\r\n\r\nquarter.  The  amendments which  are  submitted  for\r\n\r\nacceptance  would,  in fact, improve  the  Bill  and\r\n\r\nconsiderably strengthen some of its provisions.  For\r\n\r\nthis, I would like to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity here to express my thanks to  those\r\n\r\nwho  had come forward to make representations to the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to comment on every one of the\r\n\r\namendments  which  the Select Committee  decided  to\r\n\r\nrecommend  acceptance by the House.

It was pointed  out\r\n\r\nboth in written representations and in oral evidence\r\n\r\nthat  abortions involve primarily the female  person\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  female  representation  should  be\r\n\r\nlarger.   Hence  the  amendment  to   increase   the\r\n\r\nappointed  number  of  female members  to  at  least\r\n\r\nthree.  The number can, of course, be larger if  the\r\n\r\nMinister  wishes to appoint more women on the  Board\r\n\r\nif he considers this of advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment to the Board of two\r\n\r\n\"professionally qualified social workers\" instead of\r\n\r\npersons with \"experience in social welfare work\" was\r\n\r\nmade  on  the  suggestion of various  organisations.\r\n\r\nsuch  as  the  Catholic  Social  Guild,  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation and the professional  social\r\n\r\nworkers.   Professionally  qualified   persons   are\r\n\r\nidentifiable.  They  are  persons  who   possess   a\r\n\r\nqualification in social work, i.e., the  Diploma  in\r\n\r\nSocial  Studies. This would not be the case  if  the\r\n\r\noriginal term \"experience in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\nsocial  welfare work\" is used, as this could include\r\n\r\na  range  of  persons from charitable organisations,\r\n\r\nvoluntary workers and those whose experience may  be\r\n\r\nlimited and not relevant to the issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments relating to the membership of\r\n\r\nthe Board are minor administrative amendments. Thus,\r\n\r\nfor  clarification, the filling of a casual  vacancy\r\n\r\non   the  Board  should  be  by  a  person  who  has\r\n\r\nequivalent  qualifications to  the  member  whom  he\r\n\r\nreplaces.  Also, the composition of the  Board,  but\r\n\r\nnot  the  number, may be varied by the Minister.  In\r\n\r\nthe original text the Minister would be able to vary\r\n\r\nthe composition as well as the number of members  of\r\n\r\nthe   Board.  This  appeared  objectionable  to  the\r\n\r\nCatholic Social Guild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(2) Conditions under which abortions may be authorised</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several significant amendments to the conditions\r\n\r\nunder  which abortions may be authorised  have  been\r\n\r\naccepted  as a result of the suggestions by  various\r\n\r\nrepresentations   made   orally   and   in   written\r\n\r\nsubmissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first amendment makes a qualification to the\r\n\r\nmedical  reasons  under which  an  abortion  may  be\r\n\r\nauthorised. In the original text, an abortion  could\r\n\r\nbe performed where there was risk to the life of the\r\n\r\npregnant woman or injury to her physical and  mental\r\n\r\nhealth.  The  amendment clarifies that  these  risks\r\n\r\nshould  be  \"serious\"  risks. The  addition  of  the\r\n\r\nadjective to qualify the risk to life or the  threat\r\n\r\nto  a woman's physical and mental well-being injects\r\n\r\na relative term into the considerations and probably\r\n\r\nwill  restrict the conditions under which  abortions\r\n\r\ncan  be  carried  out for medical  reasons.  If  the\r\n\r\namendment  is  accepted, medical practitioners  will\r\n\r\nprobably  find  their  area of manoeuvre  restricted\r\n\r\neven more than under the present law which allows an\r\n\r\nabortion to be performed where there is a threat  to\r\n\r\nthe  life and health of the pregnant woman,  without\r\n\r\nqualification.  The  amendment  is   made   on   the\r\n\r\nsuggestion of various representations, that is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore  Medical  Association,  the  Catholic\r\n\r\nSocial  Guild,  the Catholic Medical Guild  and  the\r\n\r\nRegional Council of Churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, however, this amendment was largely\r\n\r\nproposed  by  the  medical  profession  which   have\r\n\r\nprobably weighed the disadvantages, the amendment is\r\n\r\nsubmitted  for  acceptance.  But  I  would  like  to\r\n\r\nreiterate  here that this amendment will in  no  way\r\n\r\nweaken this part of the Bill. In fact, it will serve\r\n\r\nto clarify the position of this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment (made to clause 5 (2) (d))\r\n\r\nadds  another condition under which an abortion  may\r\n\r\nbe approved by the Board. This is when pregnancy has\r\n\r\nbeen due to carnal connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Women's Charter makes unlawful carnal\r\n\r\nconnection with any girl under 16 years of age.  The\r\n\r\nexception  is  when the girl is married.  Since  the\r\n\r\nclause provides that pregnancy consequent on rape or\r\n\r\nincest  is  ground for abortion, it is equally  good\r\n\r\ngrounds for adding this other sexual assault on  the\r\n\r\ngirl to be included under this clause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further amendment relating to the conditions\r\n\r\nunder  which abortions can be performed  relates  to\r\n\r\nabortions in cases of emergencies. This is  provided\r\n\r\nunder  clause  5  (5).  Under this  clause,  it  was\r\n\r\nprovided that an abortion could be performed when it\r\n\r\nis  immediately necessary to save the  life  of  the\r\n\r\npregnant mother or to prevent grave permanent injury\r\n\r\nto  the  physical or mental health of  the  pregnant\r\n\r\nwoman.   The   amendment  seeks  to   restrict   the\r\n\r\npractitioner's discretion to a condition where it is\r\n\r\nimmediately  necessary to perform the  operation  to\r\n\r\nsave the life of the pregnant woman. In other words,\r\n\r\nthe  condition where there may be reason to  perform\r\n\r\nthe  operation to prevent grave permanent injury  to\r\n\r\nphysical  or  mental health is excluded  under  this\r\n\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment was made on the suggestion of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Medical  Association  in  the  course  of\r\n\r\ndiscussions  with  its  representatives  in   Select\r\n\r\nCommittee. The view expressed was that if there  was\r\n\r\na grave threat of permanent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nphysical  or  mental injury of the  pregnant  woman,\r\n\r\nthis  should be done under a different clause  (i.e.\r\n\r\nclause  5  (3))  where a second medical  opinion  is\r\n\r\nrequired and that the operation is carried out in  a\r\n\r\nGovernment hospital or in an approved hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth significant amendment relates to the\r\n\r\ncitizenship   status  of  the  woman  applying   for\r\n\r\nabortion. The relevant clause is clause 5  (8).  The\r\n\r\noriginal text would have covered abortions under the\r\n\r\napproved conditions to residents of Singapore  only.\r\n\r\nAlthough  a  woman  who is \"resident  in  Singapore\"\r\n\r\nwould  normally include Singapore citizens, it could\r\n\r\nhappen  that  such  a citizen might  not  have  been\r\n\r\nresident  in Singapore during the four months  prior\r\n\r\nto  the  application of the abortion and  would,  by\r\n\r\ninterpretation of this clause, become ineligible for\r\n\r\nconsideration for an abortion. Obviously this is not\r\n\r\nthe  intention  of the Bill. The intention  of  this\r\n\r\nclause  is to exclude non-residents and non-citizens\r\n\r\nfrom  taking advantage of the liberalisation of  our\r\n\r\nlaws.  It  should not operate, however, against  our\r\n\r\nwomen  citizens. The amendment seeks to clarify  and\r\n\r\nforestall     the    remote,    though     possible,\r\n\r\ninterpretation of the clause against  our  citizens.\r\n\r\nIt  specifies that an abortion may be authorised  if\r\n\r\nthe pregnant woman is a resident in Singapore in the\r\n\r\nfour  months  prior  to  the application,  or  is  a\r\n\r\ncitizen or wife of a citizen of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments under this heading are\r\n\r\nadministrative and consequential to the three  major\r\n\r\namendments which I have just described. For example,\r\n\r\nit   is  provided  that  a  report  of  an  abortion\r\n\r\nperformed   for  medical  reasons   by   a   medical\r\n\r\npractitioner where the prior authority of the  Board\r\n\r\nhas not been obtained will have to be made within 14\r\n\r\ndays.  It  was  considered that  the  original  text\r\n\r\nproviding  for  the report to be made  \"as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible\" was ambiguous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(3) Processing of applications for abortions</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several amendments are proposed relating to the\r\n\r\nclauses which pertain\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto   the  work  of  the  Board  in  processing   the\r\n\r\napplications  for  abortions. This  may  briefly  be\r\n\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(a) Referrals for specialist opinion</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 7, the Board may make reference, as\r\n\r\ncircumstances arise, to specialists for an  opinion\r\n\r\non  an  application before it makes a  decision  on\r\n\r\nit.  In  the  original text, in clause 7  (4)  (d),\r\n\r\nthis  was limited to a reference to an obstetrician\r\n\r\nand  gynaecologist. It was rightly pointed out that\r\n\r\nthis  was an unnecessary restriction. There may  be\r\n\r\nother  conditions  outside  the  competence  of  an\r\n\r\nobstetrician  and gynaecologist which  may  require\r\n\r\nanother medical specialist opinion, say, that of  a\r\n\r\nphysician  or a psychiatrist. With this  amendment,\r\n\r\nthe  Board would have the discretion to refer  such\r\n\r\nmatters to the appropriate specialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(b) Consent for the operation of termination of pregnancy</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For obvious reasons, the Board has to be\r\n\r\nsatisfied that the application for abortion  is  of\r\n\r\ngenuine  intent  and  a  consent  to  undergo   the\r\n\r\noperation is an indication of this intent. A  valid\r\n\r\nconsent  for  such  an operation  is  described  in\r\n\r\nclause  8. This clause states that a valid  consent\r\n\r\nmay  be  given by a woman who is over 18  years  of\r\n\r\nage.  By  the  proposed amendment,  this  has  been\r\n\r\nextended  to  a  married woman even though  she  is\r\n\r\nunder 18 years of age.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only where the pregnant woman is unmarried\r\n\r\nand  under 18 years of age that the consent of  her\r\n\r\nparents or that of a guardian is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(c) Participation in the decisions of the Board</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a safeguard to the impartiality of the Board,\r\n\r\nan amendment is provided in clause 9 to disallow  a\r\n\r\nmember  of the Board or any committee appointed  by\r\n\r\nthe  Board involved in any way with the application\r\n\r\nor  in  the operation to terminate a pregnancy, to\r\n\r\nbe  party  to  the authorisation for  treatment  to\r\n\r\nterminate the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npregnancy. This amendment has been inserted  on  the\r\n\r\nsuggestion   of  the  Inter-Religious  Organisation,\r\n\r\nwhose  representors to the Select Committee appeared\r\n\r\nrather   concerned  and  wished   to   exclude   the\r\n\r\npossibility   of   a  conspiracy   between   medical\r\n\r\npractitioners to procure an abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>(4) Conscientious objection</i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original text of clause 10, which is called\r\n\r\nthe  \"conscience clause\", provides that a person who\r\n\r\nhas   a   conscientious  objection  may  refuse   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in any treatment to terminate pregnancy.\r\n\r\nSub-clause (2) of clause 10, however, states that in\r\n\r\nany  legal  proceedings  the  burden  of  proof   of\r\n\r\nconscientious  objection shall rest  on  the  person\r\n\r\nclaiming  to  rely  on  it. This  unfortunately  has\r\n\r\ncaused some misapprehension, as can be seen from the\r\n\r\nrepresentation of the Singapore Medical  Association\r\n\r\nas  well  as several others. Therefore, in order  to\r\n\r\nclear  the ambiguity, an amendment has been proposed\r\n\r\nwhich  will provide specifically the manner in which\r\n\r\na  person  who  may be involved in the operation  of\r\n\r\ntermination   of   pregnancy   can   indicate    his\r\n\r\nconscientious  objection  to  participate   in   the\r\n\r\noperation. This is done by the person testifying  on\r\n\r\noath  or  affirmation  that he has  a  conscientious\r\n\r\nobjection  to  participating  in  the  operation  of\r\n\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, many other amendments which\r\n\r\nhad  been  suggested by the various  representations\r\n\r\nbut  which  the  Select  Committee  had  decided  to\r\n\r\nreject.  One  of  the amendments  proposed  but  was\r\n\r\nrejected  was from the Singapore Medical Association\r\n\r\nwhich  sought to add in a phrase that an  additional\r\n\r\nchild  \"is likely to impose additional and  grievous\r\n\r\nhardship  on  the  woman  or  her  family\"  to   the\r\n\r\nenvironmental clause, i.e., clause 5 (2) (b).  As  I\r\n\r\nhave  stated  before, this proposal to add  in  this\r\n\r\nadditional phrase, though it may appear to make  the\r\n\r\nclause slightly restrictive, adds nothing materially\r\n\r\nto  the criterion already contained in it, nor  does\r\n\r\nit in any way alter its essential\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmeaning,  that  is,  to allow  abortions  on  socio-economic  grounds.  Moreover, it  has  been  rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out  that  it  may unnecessarily  impose  a\r\n\r\nrestriction  on  the  judgment of  the  Board  which\r\n\r\nalready  has  a  difficult  job  to  perform.   This\r\n\r\nsuggested  amendment was accordingly  rejected.  The\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the  rejection of the other  suggested\r\n\r\namendments become quite apparent, Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nif  you  are to read through the proceedings of  the\r\n\r\nSelect Committee as published in its Report, and  I,\r\n\r\ntherefore, do not propose to go through them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the passage of this Bill\r\n\r\ntogether  with  its  companion Bill,  the  Voluntary\r\n\r\nSterilization Bill, is certainly an event  of  major\r\n\r\nimportance to the people of our Republic. This  Bill\r\n\r\nhas  been rightly described outside this House as  a\r\n\r\nHuman  Rights Bill. When adopted by this  House,  it\r\n\r\nwill  forever  liberate our women from  the  present\r\n\r\ntyranny  of unwanted pregnancies. It will  free  the\r\n\r\nfamily  from the burden of having to feed  and  care\r\n\r\nfor  the  child  which,  on account  of  family  and\r\n\r\nfinancial hardships, it is just unable to do. As for\r\n\r\nthe  community,  it will be spared  the  tragedy  of\r\n\r\nhaving  unwanted  children from  whom  most  of  the\r\n\r\ndelinquents,  the  criminals  and  the   anti-social\r\n\r\nelements  are derived. This is the social evil  from\r\n\r\nwhich  our  community will be freed.  On  the  other\r\n\r\nhand,  it will help to ensure that children born  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  will  be wanted children, being  children\r\n\r\nwho   will   be   properly  cared   for   and   have\r\n\r\nopportunities for education and the full development\r\n\r\nof  their faculties so that they can grow up to lead\r\n\r\nmeaningful lives and contribute to our society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also respects the religious and ethical\r\n\r\nbeliefs of our people in that it does not compel any\r\n\r\nwoman to have an abortion if she does not want it on\r\n\r\naccount of her religious and ethical beliefs or  for\r\n\r\nany  other  reasons. But it makes  it  possible  for\r\n\r\nthose  whose  religious and ethical beliefs  do  not\r\n\r\nforbid  them from having an abortion to request  for\r\n\r\ntreatment by way of a deliberate act of termination\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nof pregnancy under certain conditions as specified\r\n\r\nin  the  Bill.  This  indeed  does  vindicate  the\r\n\r\nfreedom  and  rights  of the  individual  and  his\r\n\r\nconscience   which   is  so   important   in   our\r\n\r\nmultiracial and multi-religious society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passing of this Bill indeed marks a historic\r\n\r\nmilestone in the development and progress  of  our\r\n\r\nRepublic.  This  Abortion Bill, which  will  allow\r\n\r\nabortions on purely socio-economic grounds  under\r\n\r\nits environmental clause, can indeed be considered\r\n\r\none  of  the  most  progressive pieces  of  social\r\n\r\nlegislation  ever  to  be  adopted  in  the   non-Communist world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, when it becomes law, will be in force\r\n\r\nfor four years and may be extended for a period of\r\n\r\nnot  more than one year, after which it will  have\r\n\r\nto  come up for review before Parliament. No doubt\r\n\r\ntime    and    experience   gathered   from    its\r\n\r\nadministration  will  tell us  how  effective  the\r\n\r\ngreat change proposed in this Bill will fulfil its\r\n\r\npurposes. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse,  we shall watch very carefully the effects\r\n\r\nof  the implementation of this law on our  social\r\n\r\nand  medical habits, and if it is deemed necessary\r\n\r\nin  the  light of experience gathered, it  can  be\r\n\r\nbrought up for review before this House even  much\r\n\r\nearlier.  However, I have every  confidence  that,\r\n\r\nbarring   initial   practical   difficulties    in\r\n\r\nimplementation, this Bill, on which a  great  deal\r\n\r\nof thought and consideration had been given, would\r\n\r\nmore  than  fulfil the purposes for which  it  has\r\n\r\nbeen drawn up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to the 29th\r\n\r\nDecember, 1969.\"-[Mr Barker].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Six o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Monday, 29th December, 1969.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
