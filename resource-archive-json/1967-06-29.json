About 8.4 inches of rain  were  recorded\r\n\r\nover  a  period of 24 hours on the 11th of  January\r\n\r\nthis  year. This was followed by 6.4 inches of rain\r\n\r\nover  a period of six hours on the next day. Again,\r\n\r\nabout  7.4 inches of rain fell over a period of  24\r\n\r\nhours  on  the  17th of February this  year.  These\r\n\r\nfigures  exceed the maximum rainfall  of  not  more\r\n\r\nthan  4  inches per day recorded in Singapore  ever\r\n\r\nsince   1931.  This  exceptionally  heavy  rainfall\r\n\r\ncoincided with high tide and caused the floods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other reasons for the flooding were:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlet drains at Bukit Timah Canal, Sungei\r\n\r\nWhampoa,  Sungei  Kallang, Geylang  Serai  and  New\r\n\r\nBridge  Road/South Bridge Road areas are inadequate\r\n\r\nto serve the catchment runoff.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously many low-lying areas and vacant lands\r\n\r\nserved  as  ponding  and storage  areas  for  heavy\r\n\r\nrainfall.  But  these areas have  been  filled  and\r\n\r\ndeveloped,  and  thus  cause greater  run-off  into\r\n\r\nstreams and drains which become inadequate to  cope\r\n\r\nwith this additional discharge.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the densely populated areas, rubbish and other\r\n\r\nwaste  materials  are dumped indiscriminately  into\r\n\r\nthe  drains, thus preventing the free flow of water\r\n\r\nespecially in covered drains.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures have already been taken to alleviate the\r\n\r\nflooding in Bukit Timah, Sungei Whampoa and  Sungei\r\n\r\nKallang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncatchments by (1) the Bukit Timah flood alleviation\r\n\r\nscheme, Phase 1; (2) the Sungei Whampoa improvement\r\n\r\nscheme;  and  (3)  the  Sungei Kallang  improvement\r\n\r\nscheme.

As in all\r\n\r\ncountries that have inherited their systems of  law\r\n\r\nand criminal justice from the English legal system,\r\n\r\nan accused person is presumed innocent until he has\r\n\r\nbeen  convicted of the offence with  which  he  has\r\n\r\nbeen  charged. From this fundamental precept, there\r\n\r\nfollows the equally fundamental rule which  can  be\r\n\r\nregarded  as  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  every\r\n\r\nadministration  that practises  democracy,  namely,\r\n\r\nthe  right  to  bail  which is  accorded  to  every\r\n\r\naccused   person   awaiting  trial.   And   so   in\r\n\r\nconstitutional laws governing the procedure in  all\r\n\r\ncriminal  trials, we find rules ensuring the  offer\r\n\r\nof  bail to every accused person who stands charged\r\n\r\nwith  an offence. However, as hon. Members  of  the\r\n\r\nHouse   will   appreciate,  all  these  fundamental\r\n\r\nprecepts would be made a mockery of if they were to\r\n\r\nbe   applied   as  absolute  rules  unbending   and\r\n\r\nregardless   of   circumstances,   variations,   or\r\n\r\nsituations that must occur in any given  case.  And\r\n\r\nso  even in the Criminal Procedure Code as  it  now\r\n\r\nstands,  there are exceptions where  bail  must  be\r\n\r\nrefused altogether - for example, in cases of  murder\r\n\r\nand treason and such like offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again there are cases where the offer of bail is\r\n\r\nnot as of right but at the discretion of the court,\r\n\r\nand,  lastly,  a  third  category  comprising   the\r\n\r\nmajority of offences in which bail is offered as of\r\n\r\nright to accused persons pending trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne  could therefore say that as a general rule our\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure  Code  requires  that  bail  be\r\n\r\noffered  as  of right to the alleged criminal.  And\r\n\r\nthis  is  even  so  in regard to  offences  against\r\n\r\npublic  tranquillity  which  are  grouped  together\r\n\r\nunder  Chapter VIII of Schedule A to the Code.  All\r\n\r\nsuch  offences  like rioting and unlawful  assembly\r\n\r\nare  bailable  as of right. This, in effect,  means\r\n\r\nthat  the  accused  person must  be  offered  bail,\r\n\r\nirrespective  of  the difficulties  that  might  be\r\n\r\nfaced by the prosecution in their efforts to get up\r\n\r\ntheir  case by reason of the accused being let  out\r\n\r\nfree  and  irrespective of the number of times  the\r\n\r\naccused person continues to commit the same offence\r\n\r\nwhilst awaiting trial for the offence with which he\r\n\r\nhas been charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of the last few months of rioting\r\n\r\nand  destruction of public and private property  in\r\n\r\nthe  Republic  has emphasised the  inadequacies  of\r\n\r\ncertain  of the present provisions in our rules  of\r\n\r\nprocedure requiring the offer of bail as of  right.\r\n\r\nPersons  charged under section 144 for  joining  an\r\n\r\nunlawful  assembly armed with deadly weapons  must,\r\n\r\nin  accordance with our present rules of procedure,\r\n\r\nbe offered bail as of right. Again, persons charged\r\n\r\nunder  section 145 for joining or continuing in  an\r\n\r\nunlawful   assembly,  knowing  that  it  has   been\r\n\r\ncommanded  to disperse, are likewise to be  offered\r\n\r\nbail.  The  offer of bail is again  obligatory  and\r\n\r\nmust  be  made to persons charged with  rioting  or\r\n\r\nrioting  armed with deadly weapons or with offences\r\n\r\ncommitted  by one of their number whilst they  form\r\n\r\npart of an unlawful assembly, or hiring or engaging\r\n\r\nor  employing persons to take part in  an  unlawful\r\n\r\nassembly.  Again,  persons who  knowingly  join  or\r\n\r\ncontinue  in  an assembly of five or  more  persons\r\n\r\nafter  it  has  been  commanded  to  disperse,  are\r\n\r\ntreated  in exactly the same way as persons charged\r\n\r\nwith assaulting or obstructing public servants when\r\n\r\nsuppressing a riot. Such persons under the existing\r\n\r\nlaw  will have to be offered bail even though there\r\n\r\nis  the  likelihood  that they  would  continue  to\r\n\r\ncommit  the  same  offences whilst awaiting  trial.\r\n\r\nPersons who wantonly give provocation with intent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  cause a riot, are entitled as of right to bail,\r\n\r\neven  if a riot ensues, and no amount of objections\r\n\r\non  the  part  of the law enforcement officers  can\r\n\r\nconfer upon the court the right to refuse bail. All\r\n\r\nthose  accused  of  such  offences  which  militate\r\n\r\nagainst a well-ordered society are bailable and  to\r\n\r\nthe extent of denying even the courts who are given\r\n\r\nthe authority and jurisdiction to decide upon their\r\n\r\nguilt  or otherwise, the right to consider  whether\r\n\r\nor not in the particular circumstances in any given\r\n\r\ncase, bail should be refused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ever since the Barisan Sosialis decided to\r\n\r\ncarry out their struggle outside Parliament and  to\r\n\r\nabjure the constitutional process, Communist  Front\r\n\r\nmembers have mounted a campaign to disrupt law  and\r\n\r\norder   in  our  society  as  evidenced  by   their\r\n\r\ndemonstrations  in  the streets  and  their  wanton\r\n\r\ndestruction  of  both public and private  property.\r\n\r\nThe   Government  cannot  afford  to  ignore   this\r\n\r\norganised  threat to the public peace,  and  recent\r\n\r\nevents have emphasised the need to tighten our laws\r\n\r\nin  respect  of bail. The Police have  evidence  to\r\n\r\nshow  that those who have been charged with rioting\r\n\r\nand destruction of property have, after their being\r\n\r\ncharged in court and let out on bail, gone back  to\r\n\r\ncommit  the  very same crimes for  which  they  had\r\n\r\nalready been charged.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government owes a duty to the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore  to  ensure that such  lawless  gangs  of\r\n\r\nhooligans,  whatever their ideologies and  whatever\r\n\r\ntheir  political persuasions may be, should not  be\r\n\r\nallowed to take advantage of the liberalism of  our\r\n\r\ndemocratic system to undermine democracy itself.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These present rules which were devised during an\r\n\r\nera  of  comparative peace and quiet  must  not  be\r\n\r\nallowed  to be abused by those who seek to  destroy\r\n\r\nthe  very  basis  and fabric of our society  whilst\r\n\r\nsheltering under the benefit of the very laws  they\r\n\r\nso flagrantly flout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in this Bill have been designed to\r\n\r\ncorrect  these  apparent defects in our  procedural\r\n\r\nlaws.  The  amendments contained in this Bill  will\r\n\r\ntherefore make the offences I have mentioned\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nearlier non-bailable. And I wish to make  it\r\n\r\nclear  that  this  does not mean  that  bail  would\r\n\r\nautomatically be refused to accused persons charged\r\n\r\nwith offences against the public tranquillity. This\r\n\r\nwill  merely mean that the courts will now be given\r\n\r\na  discretion to allow or to refuse bail  according\r\n\r\nto  the  circumstances of each case. The result  of\r\n\r\nthese  amendments  would be,  in  other  words,  to\r\n\r\nconfer  upon the court jurisdiction to refuse  bail\r\n\r\nin  respect  of these offences when heretofore  the\r\n\r\noffer  of  bail  was obligatory and  no  amount  of\r\n\r\nobjections  on  the  part of the prosecution  would\r\n\r\nmake any difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the terms\r\n\r\n\"bailable\" and \"non-bailable\" have acquired special\r\n\r\ntechnical   meanings   in  our   laws   and   these\r\n\r\nspecialised meanings have been derived  from  those\r\n\r\nbasic  fundamental precepts that I have  enunciated\r\n\r\nat  the  beginning  of  my  speech  to  the  House.\r\n\r\nOffences that are termed \"bailable\" are those where\r\n\r\nthe general rule is that an accused person must  be\r\n\r\noffered  bail. And offences that are  termed  \"non-bailable\" merely mean that those charged with these\r\n\r\noffences  are still entitled to apply for bail  but\r\n\r\neach   and  every  application  will  have  to   be\r\n\r\nconsidered  according to its merits. In  regard  to\r\n\r\nnon-bailable offences, if having regard to all  the\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the case the court arrives at  the\r\n\r\nconclusion  that the interests of the community  at\r\n\r\nlarge  must  prevail over those of the  individual,\r\n\r\nthen   it  may  refuse  bail  in  respect  of  such\r\n\r\noffences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is always\r\n\r\nreluctant  to  take any Bill on  a  Certificate  of\r\n\r\nUrgency  through  three Readings in  one  day.  But\r\n\r\nyesterday's disgraceful events outside and inside a\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court in Singapore are without a doubt\r\n\r\nvery  good  reasons  for taking this  Bill  through\r\n\r\nthree  stages  today. Some of those  who  had  been\r\n\r\ngiven bail and had under the terms of their bail to\r\n\r\nappear  before  the Court yesterday misbehaved  not\r\n\r\nonly  outside but, judging by mere reports  in  the\r\n\r\nnewspapers, inside the Court as well. They  behaved\r\n\r\nin  a  manner  unheard of in  the  history  of  our\r\n\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P.

The original purpose of the  law\r\n\r\nis  not  to  ask people to commit any offences  and\r\n\r\nthen  to bind them by the stipulations of the  law.\r\n\r\nThe law is meant only to prevent the commission  of\r\n\r\nany   offences  by  anyone  who  disregards  common\r\n\r\ninterests  or  the security of the  nation.  So  in\r\n\r\npassing the law, the preventive side should also be\r\n\r\nemphasised.  But in the existing law,  namely,  the\r\n\r\nCriminal   Procedure  Code,   there   are   certain\r\n\r\nloopholes which any intending offender may  use  to\r\n\r\ncommit   certain  offences,  and  when   they   are\r\n\r\nprosecuted in Court they can seek the provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  law  to get bail, and thus be free  to  commit\r\n\r\nfurther offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this provision of the right of bail would\r\n\r\nbenefit them by giving them another opportunity  to\r\n\r\ncommit  further  offences. The  time  allowed  them\r\n\r\noutside  the Court before trial is used by them  to\r\n\r\ncommit  further  offences  and  to  jeopardise  the\r\n\r\ninterests of the public. From this we can see  that\r\n\r\nmore  and  more people will be encouraged  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of the loopholes in the existing law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our country is not a Communist country, we\r\n\r\ncannot  see the type of mass open trial  of  people\r\n\r\nsuch as that prevailing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin  Communist countries. But we  can  see\r\n\r\nincidents where people have committed various types\r\n\r\nof  offences  And  if such people were  brought  to\r\n\r\nCourt,  there would be a scene which would  not  be\r\n\r\nnice to look at. On such an occasion the law may be\r\n\r\nat a loss to deal with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in legislating we must also pay attention to\r\n\r\nfurther aspects relating to the protection  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  Some people may think that the  result  of\r\n\r\nthe  trial may not be of any significance to  them.\r\n\r\nAs  long as these offenders can be bailed out, they\r\n\r\nwill  continue to commit offences as before. So  if\r\n\r\nwe  were  to  retain  the old  provisions  of  the \r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure Code without any amendment,  we\r\n\r\nwould be encouraging such people and not protecting\r\n\r\nthe  people  as a whole. And the law would  not  be\r\n\r\nable to meet our obligation to protect the people.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can also see that most of these offenders are\r\n\r\nstill  young.  Our present younger  generation  are\r\n\r\ngrowing  up and receiving education, and  they  are\r\n\r\nsubject to various influences. In introducing  this\r\n\r\namendment  Bill,  we  should  bear  in   mind   the\r\n\r\nmagnanimity  of the law, because we know  that  the\r\n\r\nlaw  is  meant to protect our people and not really\r\n\r\nto  punish the offenders only. If we do not direct\r\n\r\nour  law  to a specific field, then we may allow  a\r\n\r\nsituation to develop when we may have to deal  with\r\n\r\none  case  on  one  day and on  another  day  those\r\n\r\nconvicted may want to create more disturbances  and\r\n\r\ncommit  more  serious crimes, if these  people  are\r\n\r\nemotional,  they may want to burn down a  community\r\n\r\ncentre  without any regard to whether or not  there\r\n\r\nare  any  parents or children inside the  building.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, these people have no regard  for  such\r\n\r\ninanimate  objects as traffic lights and  community\r\n\r\ncentres which are made from materials. So if  these\r\n\r\ninanimate  objects  can  be  destroyed,  then,   of\r\n\r\ncourse,  living  objects can also be  destroyed  by\r\n\r\nthem.  If we do not promptly take action to correct\r\n\r\nthe  present situation which is worsening, then  in\r\n\r\nfuture  we may be at a loss to deal with even  more\r\n\r\nserious  offences. We should be alert to all  such\r\n\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that the Criminal Procedure Code needs some\r\n\r\namendment,  such  as  what our  Minister  has  just\r\n\r\nproposed.

They behave like  mad\r\n\r\ndogs  barking at and biting people in the  streets.\r\n\r\nTheir behaviour causes great distress to the people\r\n\r\nwho think that they are really pathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, admittedly in a country which\r\n\r\npractises parliamentary democracy, personal liberty\r\n\r\nis  of  great  value. The rights of the  individual\r\n\r\nmust  be respected. We all concede this point.  But\r\n\r\nwe  must  also  realise that personal  liberty  and\r\n\r\npersonal rights must not go against the interest of\r\n\r\nthe  social  order and the national  security.  Our\r\n\r\npeople have the right of freedom, freedom of speech\r\n\r\nand  freedom  of thought without interference.  But\r\n\r\nall  these  freedoms do not mean that we can  allow\r\n\r\nthe  anti-national elements to create chaos.  These\r\n\r\nare   not   absolute  freedoms,  but  are  freedoms\r\n\r\nrelative  to the national interest. So we must  not\r\n\r\nallow  these ill-behaved anti-national elements  to\r\n\r\ncreate  collective  violence  and  commit  acts  of\r\n\r\nhooliganism in the Republic of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the past few months various\r\n\r\nincidents have shown beyond all doubt that a  small\r\n\r\nminority of anti-national elements have some  plans\r\n\r\nwhich  they intend to carry out stage by  stage  in\r\n\r\norder  to  cause  damage and create  chaos  in  our\r\n\r\nsociety.  They are causing great damage  to  public\r\n\r\nproperty  which is paid for at the expense  of  the\r\n\r\nrate-payers  and the general public. They  have  no\r\n\r\nregard for public property. They carry on their so-called struggle outside Parliament. Mr Speaker, we\r\n\r\nalso  know  that  in  many  constituencies  in  our\r\n\r\nRepublic  there are certain remote areas which  are\r\n\r\nquite  favourable  for  anti-national  elements  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their nefarious activities.  It  is  in\r\n\r\nthese areas that their activities are rife. They go\r\n\r\non   a  rampage  in  these  places,  resorting   to\r\n\r\nviolence, hooliganism and even sometimes committing\r\n\r\nacts  of  robbery.  Mr  Speaker,  under  cover  of\r\n\r\ndarkness, these people cause great damage  to  public property by using axes and other weapons. These\r\n\r\nhappen  in out-of-the-way places and away from  the\r\n\r\narm  of  the  law. We know that the people  in  the\r\n\r\nrural areas are quite appreciative of the value  of\r\n\r\nthe   recreational  opportunities  given  to   them\r\n\r\nthrough the community centres. They all make use of\r\n\r\nthe   services  provided  by  these  centres.  But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately,  it is often these areas  where  the\r\n\r\nanti-national  elements  are  active.  They  damage\r\n\r\ntelephone posts, television sets, tables and chairs\r\n\r\nand  other property in the community centres. Their\r\n\r\nirrational  and  barbarous acts  have  aroused  the\r\n\r\nindignation of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, Mr Speaker, the people by\r\n\r\nthemselves are quite helpless and so action must be\r\n\r\ntaken to curb the activities of these anti-national\r\n\r\nelements.  Their  violence must he  restricted  and\r\n\r\nconfined and, if possible, prevented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if the law in Singapore is inadequate\r\n\r\nto  deal  with them, if no preventive measures  are\r\n\r\navailable  under the existing law, then  I  believe\r\n\r\nthe  situation will be further exploited  by  these\r\n\r\nanti-national  elements.  Their  violence  will  be\r\n\r\nfurther intensified because of the loopholes in our\r\n\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are aware that recently there have\r\n\r\nbeen  frequent occurrences involving  young  people\r\n\r\nwho  have  been misguided and misled by  the  anti-national  elements and they have somewhat  imitated\r\n\r\nthe  cultural revolution that is going  on  in  Red\r\n\r\nChina  now.  Carrying red flags, they rampaged  all\r\n\r\nover the streets of Singapore, shouting slogans and\r\n\r\ncausing damage everywhere. In addition, they caused\r\n\r\ntraffic  jams  and great damage to traffic  lights.\r\n\r\nThey  have  also damaged the property of people  by\r\n\r\nburning vehicles in the streets. All this disregard\r\n\r\nfor  the rule of law and the interest of the public\r\n\r\nshould  never  be condoned or connived  at.  Strict\r\n\r\naction must be taken to deal with such misbehaviour\r\n\r\nand  violence. Otherwise Singapore will  become  an\r\n\r\nanarchic  State and representative government  will\r\n\r\nhave   failed  in  its  duty  towards  the  people.\r\n\r\nTherefore,  as  a representative Government  having\r\n\r\nthe   mandate   of   the  people,   we   have   the\r\n\r\nresponsibility - a great responsibility, indeed, Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker  - to ensure that there is social order  and\r\n\r\nhappiness among our people. In other words, we must\r\n\r\ntake  all  possible action to protect  the  people,\r\n\r\ntheir  property  and their lives from  these  anti-national  elements.  This is our  solemn  duty.  In\r\n\r\norder  that  there is peace in our country  and  to\r\n\r\nensure  that  the people of Singapore are  able  to\r\n\r\ncontinue their normal way of life, I fully  support\r\n\r\nthis  amendment Bill. I believe it will go  a  long\r\n\r\nway  towards preventing further damage and violence\r\n\r\nby  the  anti-national elements. They will  not  be\r\n\r\nable to stay at large under the protective cover of\r\n\r\nbail  to  carry out further damage and create  more\r\n\r\nchaos in our State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area of this small island Republic of\r\n\r\nSingapore  is only 225 square miles. It  is  not  a\r\n\r\nplace   for  those  who  know  only  how  to  shout\r\n\r\nCommunist  slogans. Our new Republic  wants  to  go\r\n\r\nforward  and  become  viable.  We  are  taking  all\r\n\r\npossible  action  to develop our country  - building\r\n\r\nmulti-storey  flats  and  schools,  improving   the\r\n\r\ntraffic system and erecting more traffic lights - so\r\n\r\nas to enhance our standard of living. So we\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncannot  allow  these  hooligans  and  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements to put a spoke in our wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, let me reiterate my full\r\n\r\nsupport for this amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.54 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  on those of us who  have  made  the\r\n\r\nRepublic  of Singapore their Republic and who  have\r\n\r\nno cause to come to any headlong collision with the\r\n\r\nlaw,  this Bill, which seeks to amend the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code, will have no effect. To those  who\r\n\r\nare  responsible  for the maintenance  of  law  and\r\n\r\norder,  and  the  Government in  particular,  these\r\n\r\nchanges  appear to be necessary, if only to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat all of us who claim the protection of the  law\r\n\r\nmay  not he deprived of this right. The law  as  it\r\n\r\nnow  stands  has not been amended for a  very  long\r\n\r\ntime.  But  what  has  been  provided  for  in  the\r\n\r\nCriminal  Procedure Code has during the  course  of\r\n\r\nthe   last  few  weeks  been  found  to  be   quite\r\n\r\ninadequate.  It  would  appear  that  the  Criminal\r\n\r\nProcedure  Code,  as it is, lays down  the  general\r\n\r\nrule  that  there must be an offer of bail  to  all\r\n\r\npersons  charged with any criminal offence for  the\r\n\r\nperiod  that  such  person is awaiting  trial.  The\r\n\r\nright of bail always exists, provided the court  is\r\n\r\nsatisfied   that  sufficient  guarantees   can   be\r\n\r\nprovided  to  ensure the appearance of the  accused\r\n\r\nperson in court on the day of his trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.00 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, any person charged with a criminal\r\n\r\noffence is given bail. In this respect, not all the\r\n\r\nprovisions in the law are altered. The only changes\r\n\r\ncontemplated  lie in regard to the courts  who  can\r\n\r\nnow refuse bail if they are satisfied, for example,\r\n\r\nthat  the  accused  is  likely  to  interfere  with\r\n\r\nevidence or with witnesses for the prosecution,  or\r\n\r\nthat  he  is  likely to commit the  same  or  other\r\n\r\ncriminal offences during the period he is on  bail.\r\n\r\nThe  need to amend the provisions relating to  bail\r\n\r\nin respect of these offences, which after all have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbeen  devised to ensure that public peace and order\r\n\r\nis  maintained,  cannot  be  overemphasised.  These\r\n\r\nchanges  in the law, as far as I can see,  make  no\r\n\r\nradical  departure  from the  generally  recognised\r\n\r\nprinciples of fair trial and equal protection under\r\n\r\nthe  law.  A man charged is still presumed innocent\r\n\r\nif  he  is allowed bail. There are people who  have\r\n\r\nbeen charged and who, during the period they are on\r\n\r\nbail  and before their trial, are likely to  commit\r\n\r\nthe  same  offence which will disturb public  peace\r\n\r\nand  destroy public property. As an example, I read\r\n\r\nin today's Straits Times an incident which occurred\r\n\r\nyesterday. Persons who were on bail damaged  public\r\n\r\nproperty to the extent that the magistrate, who was\r\n\r\ntrying  them, was unable `to do anything  good  for\r\n\r\nthe Republic so that law and order may prevail.  If\r\n\r\nI  were  the  magistrate yesterday,  I  would  have\r\n\r\npressed the button and called for the Reserve  Unit\r\n\r\nto   arrest  them  and  charge  them  again.   But,\r\n\r\nunfortunately, I was not the magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the judicial authority must he satisfied that\r\n\r\nif  bail is granted, the accused will not interfere\r\n\r\nwith  evidence  nor  with  the  witnesses  for  the\r\n\r\nprosecution, and that he will not commit a  further\r\n\r\ncriminal  offence.  The results achieved  by  these\r\n\r\namendments should not in any way prejudice  any  of\r\n\r\nthe  democratic principles of the rule of law  that\r\n\r\none  finds in all the declarations on human  rights\r\n\r\nand   criminal  procedure  codes.  The  fundamental\r\n\r\nrights  of  the individual under the law should  be\r\n\r\nsafeguarded as always. So we must not think only of\r\n\r\nthose who offend the law and forget about the  rest\r\n\r\nof  our  people who are law-abiding and who have  a\r\n\r\nright  to  claim the protection of  the  law.  This\r\n\r\naspect  of  the matter will no doubt be taken  into\r\n\r\nconsideration by the court in deciding  whether  to\r\n\r\ngrant  bail or not. The court is merely  given  the\r\n\r\ndiscretion  to  allow  or to refuse  bail.  As  one\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the liberty of the  individual  as\r\n\r\nwell  as the security of the Republic, and  as  one\r\n\r\nwho  is desirous of seeing that the rule of law  is\r\n\r\nnot defeated by its very provisions on procedure, I\r\n\r\nwould  not hesitate to give my wholehearted support\r\n\r\nfor  these  changes in the law. In my  view,  these\r\n\r\nchanges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nare  necessary and appear to be a fair  and  proper\r\n\r\nmanner of achieving what must be the desired object\r\n\r\nof   a   well  administered  country,  namely,   an\r\n\r\neffective  means  of ensuring that  law  and  order\r\n\r\nprevails and that the well-being of its citizens is\r\n\r\nin no way impaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.08 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):\r\n\r\nSir,  I  fully support the Criminal Procedure  Code\r\n\r\n(Amendment) Bill. In the present circumstances  and\r\n\r\nfor  the  sake of respecting our national  dignity,\r\n\r\npublic   interest,  political  security,   economic\r\n\r\nprosperity and social order, and in order to  allow\r\n\r\nour two million people to live in peace, I feel  it\r\n\r\nis necessary to amend the present law. We know that\r\n\r\nthe  purpose of the amendment Bill is not to  allow\r\n\r\nthose who carry out anti-national, destructive  and\r\n\r\nsabotage activities to avail themselves of the bail\r\n\r\nprovided in the law and come out free and  be  able\r\n\r\nto  carry  out such activities again. The  Minister\r\n\r\nhas said that some people on bail have continued to\r\n\r\ncommit   the  same  offence  for  which  they   are\r\n\r\nprosecuted.  From  this  we  can  see  that  it  is\r\n\r\nnecessary  to  amend the present law  relating  to\r\n\r\nbail  granted  to  a person who  is  accused  of  a\r\n\r\ncertain offence. So this is a pressing problem  for\r\n\r\nus.  Ours  is a responsible government which  looks\r\n\r\nafter  the  interests of the people.  We  have  the\r\n\r\ntrust  laid  upon us by the general masses  and  we\r\n\r\nshould  try our best to rule the country and  serve\r\n\r\nthe people well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the anti-national Barisan Sosialis have\r\n\r\ncarried  out  a series of riots and demonstrations,\r\n\r\ncausing  social disorder with a view to  disrupting\r\n\r\nthe  peace  and  good  order  of  our  society  and\r\n\r\nhindering  our economic and industrial development.\r\n\r\nThey  hope  by such acts to destroy our  democratic\r\n\r\nsystem  and create a situation in which our economy\r\n\r\nwill  become  bankrupt  and  the  people  will   be\r\n\r\ndissatisfied, so that the time may be ripe for them\r\n\r\nto engage in their so-called revolution. Sir, their\r\n\r\nactions are obviously very sinister. They hope that\r\n\r\nthere  would be disorder and general chaos  in  the\r\n\r\nRepublic, and they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwant  to put a stop to the national security, peace\r\n\r\nand  prosperity which we are now enjoying.

We  can  say that Singapore  is  the  most\r\n\r\npeaceful and prosperous country in South-East Asia.\r\n\r\nIn  order  to preserve the national prosperity  and\r\n\r\npeace   and  interests  of  the  people,  we,   the\r\n\r\nGovernment, have a responsibility to see that  such\r\n\r\nanti-national elements cannot carry on  with  their\r\n\r\nactivities,  such  as  damaging  public   property,\r\n\r\nbreaking  of street lights, upsetting rubbish  bins\r\n\r\nand   various   other  acts.  Such   barbaric   and\r\n\r\nuncultured acts have caused great indignation among\r\n\r\nthe  people.  Therefore, today  before  this  House\r\n\r\nthere  is  this Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  under a Certificate of Urgency. I  feel  that\r\n\r\nall  the  people  expect this  Bill  to  be  passed\r\n\r\nquickly in order to deal with the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as for the families of those who have been\r\n\r\nprosecuted for their recent offences, I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthey   would  also  welcome  this  amendment   Bill\r\n\r\nbecause, as parents or as relatives of such people,\r\n\r\ntheir  children  may become useful and  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  and  live  in the  proper  way  with  the\r\n\r\npassing of this Bill into law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.14 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill because it will enable such\r\n\r\noffenders  to repent and turn over a new  leaf.  In\r\n\r\nfact,  those  people who are misled by the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis   into  participating  in  various   anti-national  activities are young  people.  They  have\r\n\r\nbeen  excited and fooled by the Barisan's high tune\r\n\r\nand  revolutionary slogans. They go  out  into  the\r\n\r\nstreets   to   carry  out  revolutionary   actions,\r\n\r\nchanting slogans and yelling abusive language.  But\r\n\r\nwhen  the  police patrol cars arrive,  these  brave\r\n\r\nrevolutionaries  do  not carry out  their  struggle\r\n\r\nconstitutionally but they throw\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstones  at the police and disperse. From all  this,\r\n\r\nwe  can  see that most of the members of  this  so-called  voluntary  vanguard have been  fooled  into\r\n\r\ntaking  part in such illegal activities.  But  when\r\n\r\nthey  meet the police, they take to their heels  as\r\n\r\nquickly as possible!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis have announced that they will\r\n\r\ncarry  on  with the struggle outside Parliament  by\r\n\r\ninstituting  what they call the \"Anti  Three  Harms\r\n\r\nCampaign\"  in  order to overthrow  the  P.A.P, and\r\n\r\nestablish  their own regime. But what is surprising\r\n\r\nis that their engineered demonstrations and parades\r\n\r\nhave  never  been  successful. In fact,  they  have\r\n\r\nroused  the  indignation  of  the  masses  because,\r\n\r\nfirstly,  they  destroy  community  centres   which\r\n\r\nrender  good  services  to the  people,  especially\r\n\r\nthose  in the rural areas; secondly, they  beat  up\r\n\r\nteachers,  and this is a very great moral  offence;\r\n\r\nthirdly, they smash up traffic lights, and this  is\r\n\r\ndetrimental to public interest; and, fourthly, they\r\n\r\noverturn  rubbish  bins,  and  this  is  a   health\r\n\r\noffence.  So when they say that they are committing\r\n\r\nrebellious acts against the Government,  they  are,\r\n\r\nin  fact, carrying out ridiculous activities  which\r\n\r\nare detrimental to the people. All activities which\r\n\r\nare  against law and order are activities which are\r\n\r\ndetrimental to the interest and well-being  of  the\r\n\r\npeople.  The Barisan Sosialis will only succeed  in\r\n\r\nisolating themselves from the people. I, therefore,\r\n\r\nhope  that  the  policy  planners  of  the  Barisan\r\n\r\nSosialis  will  think  twice  about  their  present\r\n\r\npolicies   and  check  themselves  in   time   from\r\n\r\ncommitting suicide by such actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.19 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise to give my full support to this amendment Bill\r\n\r\nmoved   by   the  Minister  for  Law  and  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity that this Bill should have been\r\n\r\ntabled  today.  It  should have  been  tabled  much\r\n\r\nearlier when anti-national elements went on a  wild\r\n\r\nrampage to destroy public property and caused  fear\r\n\r\nand insecurity to the people of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the agitators behind such wild mobs are\r\n\r\ncowards.  They remain behind plotting and  prodding\r\n\r\nyoung  innocent school children to agitate  against\r\n\r\nall  sorts  of amendments introduced in Parliament.\r\n\r\nActually,  it  is a disguise. Some  time  ago,  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis decided to take up the  political\r\n\r\nstruggle  outside Parliament when  they  called  on\r\n\r\ntheir  Members to resign. To me, this  is  an  evil\r\n\r\ndesign.  They  hope to build up  an  atmosphere  on\r\n\r\nwhich  the  pro-Communists and Communists  hope  to\r\n\r\ncapitalise  and  ultimately  seize  power   on   an\r\n\r\nunconstitutional basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the riots that have taken place over the\r\n\r\nlast  few  months, one can easily  see  that  young\r\n\r\ninnocent  school children are being used  - children\r\n\r\nwho have too low a mentality to distinguish between\r\n\r\nright  and wrong and between what can be  done  and\r\n\r\nwhat cannot be done. One can also see that the real\r\n\r\npersons  behind such acts of vandalism should  come\r\n\r\nforward  and  not  stay behind and  merely  act  as\r\n\r\noperators. I brand these persons as sheer  cowards.\r\n\r\nThey try to provoke our police. I was told that  in\r\n\r\nthe  incident yesterday outside the premises of the\r\n\r\nFourth Magistrate's Court our police officers  were\r\n\r\nnot  only  jeered at but were also kicked with  the\r\n\r\naim  of provoking them into stronger action against\r\n\r\ninnocent  children who were being made  use  of  by\r\n\r\nsinister people behind the scenes. These people had\r\n\r\nhoped  that our law enforcement officers  would  be\r\n\r\nprovoked into losing their patience and turning  on\r\n\r\nthe  children. But far from it, I am glad  to  note\r\n\r\nthat   these   officers,  in   spite   of   extreme\r\n\r\nprovocation, acted with great restraint and did not\r\n\r\nlose  their  nerve. If the agitators had  succeeded\r\n\r\nand  a  good number of young innocent students  had\r\n\r\nbeen  injured in yesterday's incident - and this  is\r\n\r\nwhat  they had wanted to see - they would have  said\r\n\r\nto foreign correspondents and cameramen, \"There you\r\n\r\nare,  the P.A.P. Government is bad and dictatorial.\r\n\r\nIt  uses  strong-armed tactics  on  these  innocent\r\n\r\nchildren  who are fighting for a good cause.\"  Such\r\n\r\ntechniques  are  not uncommon, and  if  I  remember\r\n\r\nwell, there were similar incidents\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na couple of years ago when the Chinese system\r\n\r\nof  education  was  slightly modified.

For that reason, I would  urge\r\n\r\nthat further amendments should be introduced so  as\r\n\r\nto  empower the Government to deal more firmly with\r\n\r\nsuch agitators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.31 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport  the  Criminal Procedure  Code  (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill  which  seeks  to deprive offenders  of  their\r\n\r\nautomatic right to bail when arrested for  unlawful\r\n\r\ngathering and for offences of rioting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House today is not discussing the theory of\r\n\r\nliberty  or  the abstract rights of the individual.\r\n\r\nWe  are facing a situation in which a small band of\r\n\r\npolitical  bankrupts has openly  declared  that  it\r\n\r\nwill  take  to  street  violence  as  its  form  of\r\n\r\nstruggle, the irony of which is that it is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsupposed  to  be struggling for democracy.

Our\r\n\r\nclear  duty today is to see that our people can  go\r\n\r\nabout without fear, that our facilities erected  at\r\n\r\npublic  expense are not damaged, and that  our  law\r\n\r\nenforcing officers are not handcuffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past month, owing to the prevailing\r\n\r\nuncertain  conditions existing in certain countries\r\n\r\nin  this region, substantial investment funds  have\r\n\r\nflown from there. Some of the funds landed here. In\r\n\r\nmy role as a businessman and a manufacturer, I have\r\n\r\ncome  across  many instances where  these  overseas\r\n\r\nfunds  are  seeking investments  here.  This  House\r\n\r\nknows  only  too well that we need  every  cent  of\r\n\r\nthose funds for investment, if we are to solve  our\r\n\r\nunemployment problem. Unfortunately,  this  is  not\r\n\r\nsufficiently realised by those misguided  few  who,\r\n\r\nby  committing such acts, destroy their own chances\r\n\r\nof  employment.  To  these misguided  few,  I  say,\r\n\r\nplease  think carefully; our country,  our  people,\r\n\r\nand our Government are doing everything possible to\r\n\r\nindustrialise   in  order  to   create   more   job\r\n\r\nopportunities.  By taking to street  violence,  you\r\n\r\nare scaring away foreign investors as well as local\r\n\r\nentrepreneurs.

Massive investments are needed.\r\n\r\nHooliganism  must  stop if we  are  to  retain  and\r\n\r\nattract investments.

In view of  the  recent\r\n\r\nincreasing  demonstrations and unlawful  activities\r\n\r\nby  anti-nationalist elements, I readily appreciate\r\n\r\nthat  urgent provisions are required to  deal  with\r\n\r\nthese agitators and demonstrators.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just this morning we read in the newspapers of the\r\n\r\ndisturbances both outside and inside a Magistrate's\r\n\r\nCourt.  We:  have  heard in this  House  this  very\r\n\r\nafternoon the statement of the Minister of State of\r\n\r\nDefence  that  since  January  this  year  unlawful\r\n\r\nassemblies and demonstrations have increased  month\r\n\r\nby  month.  We  have also heard from  the  Minister\r\n\r\nintroducing  the Bill that there was evidence  that\r\n\r\nsome  of the demonstrators charged under the  Penal\r\n\r\nCode  while on bail were again committing the  same\r\n\r\noffences. And, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my constituency\r\n\r\nof  Choa  Chua  Kang, a brand-new community  centre\r\n\r\nbuilt by the people in my constituency out of their\r\n\r\nown money was tarred and painted on with slogans by\r\n\r\nanti-nationalist elements. This lack of respect for\r\n\r\npublic  property  and for law  and  order  requires\r\n\r\nurgent measures to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes proposed in the Bill are nothing\r\n\r\nunusual,  Mr Speaker, Sir. In what little  time  I\r\n\r\nhad,  I  did  a  little  research  and  found  that\r\n\r\noriginally   under  the  Criminal  Procedure   Code\r\n\r\noffences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder  section  143 of the Penal Code  and  cognate\r\n\r\noffences  were  bailable. In 1957,  however,  these\r\n\r\noffences   were  made  non-bailable   by   amending\r\n\r\nOrdinance  29  of  1957. But in  1960,  these  same\r\n\r\noffences  were again made bailable by Ordinance  18\r\n\r\nof  1960. Therefore, there is nothing new  in  this\r\n\r\namending  Bill  at all. It is just  a  question  of\r\n\r\nmaking   provisions  to  deal  with   the   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances  that are obtaining in  Singapore  at\r\n\r\nthis particular moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has also explained to us the legal meaning of \"non-bailable\". It does not mean that a person so charged under this particular section of the Penal Code cannot get bail at all. It only means that instead of the automatic right to bail the person charged would have to make out a case\r\n\r\nfor bail. This does not infringe on the fundamental\r\n\r\nliberty of the subject and in no way detracts  from\r\n\r\nthe subject's fundamental right to a fair trial and\r\n\r\nequality  before  the  law.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.44 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Sir, I stand up\r\n\r\nto  support the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment)\r\n\r\nBill.

As is known to  all,\r\n\r\nSir,  the tactics of Communists everywhere  are  to\r\n\r\ncreate  confusion and chaos in a country  and  then\r\n\r\ntopple  and  take  over the administration  if  the\r\n\r\nsituation  gets out of hand, The incidents  in  the\r\n\r\nMagistrate's Court yesterday will suffice to  prove\r\n\r\ntheir  evil  design,  which was  to  challenge  the\r\n\r\nauthority  of the magistrate.

Since  the\r\n\r\nboycott   by   the  Barisan  Sosialis  Members   of\r\n\r\nParliament  and their subsequent resignations  from\r\n\r\nParliament,   the  Barisan  Sosialis  have   openly\r\n\r\ndeclared their determination to carry out their so-called struggle in the streets outside Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are Red Guards in the\r\n\r\nPeople's Republic of China, Here in our Republic we\r\n\r\nhave what I would like to call them in Mandarin Hon\r\n\r\nliu  man,  which literally means Red hooligans,  as\r\n\r\nthey  deserve  to  be  called. These  anti-national\r\n\r\nelements  are  now out in the streets  defying  not\r\n\r\nonly  police orders and obstructing the  duties  of\r\n\r\nthe   law   officers,  but  also  damaging   public\r\n\r\nproperty.  They  have gone even further  now  -they\r\n\r\ndamage  even private properties belonging  to  law-abiding  citizens. This is indeed most contemptible\r\n\r\nand despicable. Mr Speaker, Sir, this House should\r\n\r\nask  the  Government to take drastic action against\r\n\r\nthese  anti-national elements and  stamp  them  out\r\n\r\nonce and for all. Sir, Government action alone will\r\n\r\nnot  be sufficient. There must be co-operation from\r\n\r\nthe  public.  There  is much that  the  law-abiding\r\n\r\ncitizens  can do in helping to put an end  to  this\r\n\r\nopen  defiance  of the law. The public  should  not\r\n\r\nregard this as a matter for the Government to solve\r\n\r\nwhen, in fact, their daily livelihood and interests\r\n\r\nare directly involved and their future jeopardised.\r\n\r\nCivic  organisations or registered societies should\r\n\r\ncome out and openly condemn such acts. At least  it\r\n\r\nwill  have  a deterrent effect in that these  anti-national elements will not think that their lawless\r\n\r\nacts have the support of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by saying that our\r\n\r\nlaws must be respected and not challenged, and that\r\n\r\nlaw and order must be maintained at all costs.

Section\r\n\r\n7, as it now stands, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Where any application made to any criminal court\r\n\r\nby  or  on  behalf  of any person  charged  with  a\r\n\r\nscheduled offence in respect of the release on bail\r\n\r\nof  such person is opposed by the Public Prosecutor\r\n\r\nor  a  Deputy Public Prosecutor the court to  which\r\n\r\nsuch  application is made shall, unless it  is  the\r\n\r\nHigh Court, refer such application for the decision\r\n\r\nof  the  High  Court  or a Judge  and,  until  such\r\n\r\ndecision  has  been  obtained,  shall  remand  such\r\n\r\nperson in custody.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to amend this section has been brought\r\n\r\nabout  by a case decided in the High Court in 1955.\r\n\r\nThe court then held that the words in section 7, as\r\n\r\nit  now stands, are not sufficiently clear and that\r\n\r\nthe Legislature could not have intended to abrogate\r\n\r\nthe  substantive  right to bail  which  has  to  be\r\n\r\noffered where the offence is bailable as of  right,\r\n\r\nand that this was so despite the fact that such  an\r\n\r\noffence  has  been listed in the  Schedule  to  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance.

The\r\n\r\npurpose   of   this   Bill  is  to   remedy   these\r\n\r\ndeficiencies and to give such a scientific advisory\r\n\r\nbody   official  status.  The  functions   of   the\r\n\r\nScientific Council will be to investigate  problems\r\n\r\nof  a technical nature which are of interest to the\r\n\r\nGovernment,   to   report  on   matters   involving\r\n\r\nscientific    and   technological   research    and\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  to  study how industrial  development\r\n\r\ncan  be  promoted  by  the effective  training  and\r\n\r\nutilisation   of   scientific   and   technological\r\n\r\nmanpower, and to establish official relations  with\r\n\r\nother scientific organisations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In modern societies it is not cultural values\r\n\r\nalone  that  are  the attributes  of  civilisation.\r\n\r\nCivilisation  is  now  also  associated  with   the\r\n\r\npresence  or absence of those utilities which  make\r\n\r\nliving  more comfortable and which have  been  made\r\n\r\npossible  by technical inventions such as  a  ready\r\n\r\nsupply  of  electric  power,  a  working  telephone\r\n\r\nsystem, modern sanitation and so on. But all  these\r\n\r\nutilities would not be possible if we do  not  have\r\n\r\nthe  technical  manpower to  organise  or  maintain\r\n\r\nthem.  We  are fortunate that we have in  Singapore\r\n\r\nwell   over   2,000   scientists,   engineers   and\r\n\r\ntechnologists.  Of  these,  about  two-thirds   are\r\n\r\npractising  their professions in either the  public\r\n\r\nor  private sector and the remaining one-third  are\r\n\r\nteaching in the schools.

This is an image\r\n\r\nwhich  our  scientists should discard and  take  on\r\n\r\ninstead the role of a man of action, No doubt there\r\n\r\nwill be problems of a purely technical nature which\r\n\r\nwill  require the attention of the back-room  boys,\r\n\r\nbut  scientists and engineers can be more effective\r\n\r\nif   they  can  also  comprehend  the  relationship\r\n\r\nbetween technological innovation and economics  and\r\n\r\ndevelop  a flair for administration. Scientists  by\r\n\r\nvirtue   of   their  training  in  analytical   and\r\n\r\ndeductive   processes   can   quickly   grasp   the\r\n\r\nessentials  of a problem and understand  its  nexus\r\n\r\nwith  other problems.

As an interim measure, and in  order  to\r\n\r\nenable solicitors who had uncompleted contracts  on\r\n\r\ntheir  hands  at  the  date  of  the  coming   into\r\n\r\noperation of the Act to complete the contracts, and\r\n\r\nto   save  purchasers  from  having  to  incur  the\r\n\r\nadditional  cost of employing another solicitor,  a\r\n\r\nnew  subsection (5) to section 82 of  the  Act  has\r\n\r\nbeen introduced.

Possibly  as  an\r\n\r\nafterthought,  the present Singapore Advocates  and\r\n\r\nSolicitors Society had appointed a sub-committee to\r\n\r\nreview the Legal Profession Act. This sub-committee\r\n\r\nreported  some  time  ago and made  suggestions  on\r\n\r\namendments to a great many sections of this Act.  I\r\n\r\nam  not too sure whether the present amending  Bill\r\n\r\nis  the result of the recommendations of this  sub-committee,  but in its report to the Advocates  and\r\n\r\nSolicitors  Society, section 82 was recommended  to\r\n\r\nbe amended in exactly the same terms. It is a great\r\n\r\npity that other amendments recommended by this sub-committee  had not been taken into account  by  the\r\n\r\nGovernment. The explanation may be that  there  was\r\n\r\nno time. The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill was,\r\n\r\nin fact, read the First time on the 24th May, 1967,\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  sub-committee did not report  to  the\r\n\r\nAdvocates   and  Solicitors  Society  until   quite\r\n\r\nrecently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, this sub-committee recommended\r\n\r\nvarious amendments and I wish particularly to  draw\r\n\r\nattention  to  sections 54  and  55  of  the  Legal\r\n\r\nProfession  Act.  Section  54  provides   for   the\r\n\r\nelection  of eight members of seven years' standing\r\n\r\nand  two members of less than seven years' standing\r\n\r\nto the Advocates and Solicitors Society. Section 55\r\n\r\nprovides   that   members  of  the  Advocates   and\r\n\r\nSolicitors  Society  of seven years'  standing  can\r\n\r\nonly  vote for candidates of similar standing,  and\r\n\r\nthat  members  of under seven years'  standing  are\r\n\r\nsimilarly  restricted to voting only for candidates\r\n\r\nof  under  seven  years' standing.  Section  55  is\r\n\r\nparticularly unfortunate. It injects an element  of\r\n\r\ninequality into an otherwise ancient and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhonourable society where all members are equal  and\r\n\r\nare considered as brothers in the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sub-committee of the Advocates and Solicitors\r\n\r\nSociety  recommended  that  this  section  be   now\r\n\r\nrepealed   and  that  there  should  be  only   one\r\n\r\nelectoral   roll,   and   I   am   glad   of   this\r\n\r\nrecommendation.   It   is  unfortunate   that   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  has  not seen fit to  incorporate  this\r\n\r\namendment into the present amending Bill.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54, as I have said, provides for eight\r\n\r\nmembers of seven years' standing as against two  of\r\n\r\nless  than seven years' standing. The sub-committee\r\n\r\nof   the  Advocates  and  Solicitors  Society   now\r\n\r\nrecommends that the number of seniors, as  we  call\r\n\r\nthem, should be reduced to six. This section is not\r\n\r\nparticularly  a  democratic  section,  seeing  that\r\n\r\nmembers  of  the  Society of seven years'  standing\r\n\r\nform  a minority of the legal profession. But apart\r\n\r\nfrom  the fact that it is not quite democratic,  it\r\n\r\ngives  the  impression that lawyers  of  less  than\r\n\r\nseven  years' standing are not capable of  handling\r\n\r\ntheir own affairs.

Member  for  Choa  Chu  Kang  that  the\r\n\r\namendments which he proposes and which he says were\r\n\r\nrecommended by a sub-committee of the Advocates and\r\n\r\nSolicitors Society have not reached me. Sir,  if  I\r\n\r\nmay  speak  briefly in reply to him, this  Act  was\r\n\r\nfirst  read  in this House in December  last  year.\r\n\r\nPrior to its introduction, the Bar Committee, as it\r\n\r\nthen  was, was consulted and, in fact, it  approved\r\n\r\nof  all the provisions in this Bill. But apparently\r\n\r\nthe  Bar  Committee did not, as I had  expected  it\r\n\r\nshould have, consult its own members. But even  so,\r\n\r\nif  any  member of the Bar had any complaint  about\r\n\r\nthis  Bill,  he  could have raised  his  objections\r\n\r\nthrough  the  hon.  Member for  Choa  Chu  Kang  in\r\n\r\nbetween the First Reading and the Second and  Third\r\n\r\nReadings  of the Bill which took place, I  believe,\r\n\r\nabout  12 to 14 days later. If only members of  the\r\n\r\nBar  read  the  newspapers  to  ascertain  what  is\r\n\r\nhappening in this House, then their suggestions and\r\n\r\nrecommendations  will certainly  be  given  careful\r\n\r\nconsideration in this House. But after the Bill has\r\n\r\nbeen  tabled and taken through its Second and Third\r\n\r\nReadings and then enacted as law, it is a  bit  too\r\n\r\nlate to grumble about the unfairness of the Bill in\r\n\r\nrespect  of certain provisions. The younger lawyers\r\n\r\nare  apparently going against the older lawyers.  I\r\n\r\nstate  my  position here quite clearly. On  a  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  deals  with any profession, we must  consult\r\n\r\nthe   profession,  and  naturally  we  consult  the\r\n\r\ncommittee  in  charge, and it is the duty  of  that\r\n\r\ncommittee  to consult its members. If it does  not,\r\n\r\nit  is  time  to change the committee.  But  having\r\n\r\nconsulted  them  and having got their  support  and\r\n\r\napproval  and  having passed the Bill,  I  am  most\r\n\r\nreluctant to come to this House again and make\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\namendment  after amendment.

Any such person who has\r\n\r\nsigned  an undertaking shall be presumed to  be  in\r\n\r\npossession or in control of such information as has\r\n\r\nbeen set out in subsection (1) of section 5 of  the\r\n\r\nOrdinance, and to have unlawfully communicated such\r\n\r\ninformation  to a foreign power, thus  contravening\r\n\r\nthe  provisions of section 5 of the Ordinance  when\r\n\r\nhe  acts  in breach of the undertaking.

It is to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  information  or  knowledge  obtained  in  the\r\n\r\ncourse  of  one's  employment  or  service  in  the\r\n\r\nGovernment of Singapore shall not be made use of by\r\n\r\nthe person who has gained such information or thing\r\n\r\nin  the  course of his official functions after  he\r\n\r\nhas  left  the  Government or its service,  Unusual\r\n\r\nthough  this provision may appear to be, I am  sure\r\n\r\nthe  House will agree with me when I say  that  the\r\n\r\nnecessity  for this law to be in our statute  books\r\n\r\ncannot  be  more  emphasised than at  this  present\r\n\r\nstage  of our development as an independent nation.\r\n\r\nThe  Bill does nothing more than provide a  further\r\n\r\nmeans  of ensuring that public security should  not\r\n\r\nbe  jeopardised by such persons parting  with  such\r\n\r\ninformation or allowing themselves to be  made  use\r\n\r\nof by foreign powers or their agencies for purposes\r\n\r\nthat  may  prove  inimical to the interest  of  our\r\n\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Secrets Act is an Act designed to\r\n\r\nensure that the official secrets of the nation  are\r\n\r\nnot  parted  with for the benefit  of  any  foreign\r\n\r\npower.  One  of the ways in which such  information\r\n\r\nmay  be  passed over to a foreign power is  through\r\n\r\nthis  avenue  of  disclosure by the State's  former\r\n\r\nemployees, especially those who have held sensitive\r\n\r\npositions  of  trust.  This new  provision,  it  is\r\n\r\nhoped,   will  be  effective  in  preventing   such\r\n\r\ninformation  from  getting into the  hands  of  any\r\n\r\nforeign power. It is, however, to be noted that not\r\n\r\neveryone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho has served the Government in positions of trust\r\n\r\nwill   thus  be  affected,  but  only  those  whose\r\n\r\npositions  in the Government or in the  service  of\r\n\r\nthe  Government are such as would allow them access\r\n\r\nto   information   or  who  would   have   acquired\r\n\r\ninformation which, in the interest of the  security\r\n\r\nof  the  nation, must be protected and kept  within\r\n\r\nthe State.

The\r\n\r\ninterpretation  of  the  aforesaid  enactments  has\r\n\r\ncaused   a  certain  amount  of  difficulty   since\r\n\r\nSingapore  separated from Malaysia in August  1965,\r\n\r\nIt  is, therefore, considered desirable to have new\r\n\r\nlegislation on those matters relating to trusts and\r\n\r\ntrustees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to consolidate and reenact the\r\n\r\nstatutory law dealing with trusts and trustees with\r\n\r\ncertain  amendments and additions. In the main,  it\r\n\r\nfollows  closely  the  provisions  of  the   former\r\n\r\nTrustees  Ordinance (Cap. 34) of Singapore repealed\r\n\r\nby  the  Trustee Investment Act, 1965, of  Malaysia\r\n\r\nwhich   extended  the  provisions  of  the  Federal\r\n\r\nTrustee   Ordinance,   1949,   to   Singapore.   No\r\n\r\nsubstantive change has been made to the  provisions\r\n\r\nof  the  former  Ordinance. The  Malaysian  Trustee\r\n\r\nInvestment  Act,  1965, also gives  new  powers  of\r\n\r\ninvestment  to trustees and imposes certain  duties\r\n\r\non  them  in  choosing  investments.  Most  of  the\r\n\r\nprovisions contained therein have been incorporated\r\n\r\ninto  this  Bill.  As  it is  proposed  to  empower\r\n\r\ntrustees   to  invest  in  authorised  unit   trust\r\n\r\nschemes,  the  expressions \"authorised  unit  trust\r\n\r\nscheme\" and \"unit trust scheme\" are defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill defines the authorised\r\n\r\ninvestments  for trust funds, and this  follows  in\r\n\r\ngeneral the investments appearing in section  4  of\r\n\r\nthe Malaysian Trustee Ordinance, 1949, as amended.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI of the Bill seeks to introduce statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions relating to charitable trusts.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 66 empowers the Public Trustee to\r\n\r\nadminister the property of charitable trusts  which\r\n\r\nare for the time being without trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 67 contains provisions to prevent the\r\n\r\ninvalidation  of a trust by reason that  the  trust\r\n\r\nfunds are directed to be applied for non-charitable\r\n\r\nand invalid purposes as well as for some\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncharitable  purposes.

The distinct impression given  is  that\r\n\r\nthe greater the scope for such a common market, the\r\n\r\nmore Singapore is in favour of it.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the trade unionists' viewpoint, this makes a\r\n\r\nwelcome change from the headlines in the newspapers\r\n\r\nabout warnings given by the Government to the trade\r\n\r\nunionists  and workers of Singapore that they  must\r\n\r\nfirst  learn  the A B C of economics and  must  not\r\n\r\nendanger   the  economy  of  Singapore  by   making\r\n\r\nexorbitant  demands  on  the  employers.

The success of our industrialisation\r\n\r\nproject does not depend only on the workers in  the\r\n\r\npioneer industries being reasonable in relation  to\r\n\r\ntheir   demands  for  better  wages   and   working\r\n\r\nconditions, but also on the industrialists' ability\r\n\r\nto find outlets for their products. It is high time\r\n\r\nthat  Members of this House were told that, if  the\r\n\r\nindustries   in   Singapore  find   difficulty   in\r\n\r\ndisposing of their products, it is not because  the\r\n\r\nhigh  cost  of  labour in Singapore has  helped  to\r\n\r\nprice  the industrial products of Singapore out  of\r\n\r\nthe  international  market, but  because  of  other\r\n\r\nfactors.  One  is  the  trade barriers  erected  by\r\n\r\nforeign  countries  out  of political  or  economic\r\n\r\nconsideration.  Another is the  psychology  of  the\r\n\r\nconsumer who prefers to stick to well-known  brands\r\n\r\nof  goods.  Even in Singapore, our local  consumers\r\n\r\nprefer   the   imported  brands  to   the   locally\r\n\r\nmanufactured  brands when the goods  concerned  are\r\n\r\nidentical in every respect except the brand name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not seek to minimise the fact that the cost\r\n\r\nof  labour has a direct bearing on the cost of  the\r\n\r\nfinal  product,  or  that the  cost  of  labour  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  may  be higher than that  prevailing  in\r\n\r\ncountries such as Malaysia, Taiwan and South  Korea\r\n\r\nwhich have the same ambition to industrialise their\r\n\r\neconomy just as\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwe  do  in Singapore. But the real reason, I think,\r\n\r\nwhy  our industries are not able to expand as  fast\r\n\r\nas  was  expected is the smallness of the  domestic\r\n\r\nmarket in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, an island Republic of 220 square miles\r\n\r\nwith   barely  two  million  population,  generally\r\n\r\nspeaking,  does  not have a domestic  market  large\r\n\r\nenough  to work any modern industry at its  optimum\r\n\r\nlevel.  The  wage  level of labour  has  no  direct\r\n\r\nbearing on the optimum size of any industry. On the\r\n\r\ncontrary,  the higher the wage-level  may  be,  the\r\n\r\nmore conducive it may be to an industry reaching an\r\n\r\noptimum  level of production because of the greater\r\n\r\npurchasing  power of the workers. This  is  by  the\r\n\r\nway;  but  my  point is that in the  absence  of  a\r\n\r\nsizable  domestic market, it is vital that we  find\r\n\r\nan international market to serve as an extension to\r\n\r\nour local market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways in which we can develop such an\r\n\r\ninternational  market to offset the sheer  physical\r\n\r\nlimitations  of our domestic market is  to  have  a\r\n\r\ncommon  market  arrangement with  our  neighbouring\r\n\r\ncountries.  I  appreciate  that  there   are   many\r\n\r\ndifficulties   in   the   way   of   concluding   a\r\n\r\nsatisfactory  common  market  arrangement,  as  the\r\n\r\nparticipating  countries may have widely  different\r\n\r\ninterests. Even during the two years when Singapore\r\n\r\nwas  in  Malaysia, we could not arrive at a  common\r\n\r\nmarket  arrangement which was provided for  in  the\r\n\r\nMalaysia Agreement. When the machinery was  finally\r\n\r\nset  up for a common market. Singapore was expelled\r\n\r\nfrom   Malaysia  and  that  was  the  end  of   the\r\n\r\nexpectation  of  a common market between  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaysia.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the many difficulties that are in the\r\n\r\nway of the formation of a common market, I envisage\r\n\r\nthat the problem of having a broader market than is\r\n\r\nprovided for by our domestic market may be resolved\r\n\r\nby  a  series  of  bilateral  trade  pacts  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  other interested countries.  It  is\r\n\r\nencouraging to note that fruitful efforts are being\r\n\r\nmade by Singapore in this direction. I have in mind\r\n\r\nthe  bilateral trade agreements made  by  Singapore\r\n\r\nwith Russia, Rumania, Bulgaria and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nother  Eastern European countries. I am sure it  is\r\n\r\nalso  the fervent wish of all Members of this House\r\n\r\nthat  the  Singapore Government should continue  to\r\n\r\nsucceed  in  its  efforts to reach bilateral  trade\r\n\r\nagreements with as many countries as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, I must express my considerable\r\n\r\nsurprise  that  there has been no  trade  agreement\r\n\r\nwith  one country in particular with which we  have\r\n\r\nconsiderable  trade. I refer  to  the  Republic  of\r\n\r\nChina  which, as you know, Sir, last year  supplied\r\n\r\nto  us  $217  million  worth of  various  forms  of\r\n\r\nmanufactured goods, while taking from us in  return\r\n\r\nnot more than a few million dollars worth of rubber\r\n\r\nand  other commodities. This is a most unfavourable\r\n\r\nflow   of   trade   between  the   two   countries,\r\n\r\nparticularly  in view of the fact  that  the  goods\r\n\r\nsupplied  by China are similar to those  which  are\r\n\r\nbeing  manufactured  by our pioneer  industries  in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This  trade  with  China  is  a  double\r\n\r\ntragedy  in  the sense that we are losing  valuable\r\n\r\nforeign  exchange to China and that  these  Chinese\r\n\r\ngoods  are undercutting the products that are being\r\n\r\nmade in Singapore. The reason why China is able  to\r\n\r\nsell  its goods at fantastically low prices,  which\r\n\r\nmay have no relation to the cost of production,  is\r\n\r\nperhaps that it wants to obtain foreign exchange -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of\r\n\r\norder.

If we cannot make\r\n\r\ncountries such as China buy more from us,  then  we\r\n\r\nmust  impose trade quotas and tariffs to discourage\r\n\r\nsuch countries from selling more to us. I am of the\r\n\r\nopinion that a severe curtailment of the import  of\r\n\r\nChinese  goods  will not prejudice the  welfare  of\r\n\r\nSingapore,  as  our  own industries  can  supply  a\r\n\r\nsimilar range of products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary for Singapore to put its\r\n\r\nrelationship with our neighbouring countries  on  a\r\n\r\nbusiness-like basis. In saying so, I have  in  mind\r\n\r\nthat  the  attitude of certain foreign  governments\r\n\r\ntoward  Singapore  is  not founded  on  a  rational\r\n\r\npolicy   of  mutual  co-existence  but  on   purely\r\n\r\nemotional   reaction  towards  the   existence   of\r\n\r\nSingapore as an independent socialist Republic.  In\r\n\r\nsuch  circumstances,  I repeat,  pending  a  common\r\n\r\nmarket  arrangement  between  Singapore  and  other\r\n\r\ninterested foreign countries, some attempts must be\r\n\r\nmade   to   equalise  the  flow  of  trade  between\r\n\r\nSingapore  and  other countries,  especially  those\r\n\r\ncountries who are selling more than buying from us.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,   we  will  have  the  most  undesirable\r\n\r\nsituation in Singapore where we have sacrificed our\r\n\r\nscant  capital  in  creating  and  developing   our\r\n\r\ncapacity for industrial production which will grind\r\n\r\nto  a  halt through our having insufficient outlets\r\n\r\nfor our industrial products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>7.01 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I welcome the constructive\r\n\r\nattitude of the hon.

Member has mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt  is not the high cost of labour alone that  will\r\n\r\nprice   an   industrial   product   out   of    the\r\n\r\ninternational market. There are also other factors.\r\n\r\nNo  one  will dispute the contention that  cost  of\r\n\r\nlabour is not the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly  factor influencing the competitiveness  of  a\r\n\r\ncountry's products. However, the cost of labour  is\r\n\r\none of the more important factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages are never too high \"per se\". They may only\r\n\r\nbe  too  high in comparison with what  is  paid  in\r\n\r\nother competing countries. As has been very rightly\r\n\r\npointed  out by the hon. Member for Telok  Blangah,\r\n\r\nwe have to compete with products from Korea, Taiwan\r\n\r\nand  Japan, where the wages may be lower than those\r\n\r\nprevailing  in  Singapore. It could be  argued,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, that in other countries, for instance,  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of  America, wages  paid  are  much\r\n\r\nhigher  than those in Singapore. It has never  been\r\n\r\ndisputed that a large market is the primary  factor\r\n\r\nfor the success of our industrialisation programme,\r\n\r\nand  steps have been taken and will continue to  be\r\n\r\ntaken to enlarge the market for Singapore goods.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The market for Singapore goods can be divided into\r\n\r\ntwo parts - (1) the local market, and (2) the export\r\n\r\nmarket.  Our local market is small, with less  than\r\n\r\ntwo  million  consumers.  This  market  is  further\r\n\r\nrestricted,  as has been pointed out  by  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMember,  by  brand consciousness of our  consumers.\r\n\r\nLocal  consumers have been repeatedly asked to  buy\r\n\r\nmore Singapore goods, and whilst it is difficult to\r\n\r\nwipe away such brand consciousness overnight, it is\r\n\r\nmy  belief  that  our consumers are taking  greater\r\n\r\npride  in  Singapore's  products  and  buying  more\r\n\r\nSingapore-made goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is allowing double tax deduction on\r\n\r\nmarket     development    expenditure,    including\r\n\r\nadvertising,  in  respect  of  locally-manufactured\r\n\r\ngoods.  The  Trade  Division,  together  with   the\r\n\r\nEconomic    Development   Board,   is    sponsoring\r\n\r\nexhibitions, trade expositions, and fairs  to  make\r\n\r\nlocal   products   better   known   to   consumers.\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments and  statutory  bodies  are\r\n\r\nincreasingly buying more local products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways to increase our international\r\n\r\nmarket  is  by  participation in free trade  areas,\r\n\r\nregional agreements, common markets, and the  like.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sir, we must have\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npartners  with whom to conclude such agreements  or\r\n\r\narrangements.

We have  to  be  very\r\n\r\ncareful  in  this field, perhaps more careful  than\r\n\r\ncountries  which do not have such a large  entrepot\r\n\r\ntrade   as  Singapore  has.  However,  the   Export\r\n\r\nPromotion  Centre,  which was  formed  specifically\r\n\r\nwith  the objective of finding an expanding  market\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore goods, and the Ministry  of  Finance\r\n\r\nare   continuously  and  carefully   studying   all\r\n\r\npossibilities  which may materialise  and  to  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of such opportunities and situations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have already concluded trade agreements with\r\n\r\nthe U.S.S.R., Rumania, Poland, and other countries.\r\n\r\nWe are sending trade missions to these countries in\r\n\r\nAugust  this  year. This mission will  comprise  30\r\n\r\npersons, including businessmen and officials,  They\r\n\r\nwill  go  to  seven Eastern European  countries  to\r\n\r\nconsolidate  the  results  obtained  by  the  first\r\n\r\nnegotiations   held  in  Singapore.  To   publicise\r\n\r\nSingapore products in the international market, the\r\n\r\nExport  Promotion  Centre  has  started  an  active\r\n\r\ncampaign  in the foreign Press. Singapore has  been\r\n\r\nwidely   advertised  in  at  least  two   important\r\n\r\nmagazines  circulating  in  the  European   market.\r\n\r\nSingapore is also participating actively in foreign\r\n\r\nexhibitions  and fairs where it is considered  that\r\n\r\nthere are possibilities of expanding its market  by\r\n\r\nsuch participation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one or two months' time, our Export Promotion\r\n\r\nCentre  will  be sending industrialists  to  Zambia\r\n\r\nwhere   opportunities   of  finding   markets   for\r\n\r\nSingapore   products  are  good.  Our  efforts   in\r\n\r\npromoting exports of domestic products are  showing\r\n\r\nresults. In 1963\r\n\r\n                                                 \r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$277 million worth of domestic goods were exported.\r\n\r\nThis  increased to $345 million in  1965  and  $400\r\n\r\nmillion  in  1966,  To encourage  export-orientated\r\n\r\nindustries,  I  have  in  my  last  Budget   speech\r\n\r\nannounced  fiscal  incentives for such  industries.\r\n\r\nResults should show in 1968. I have also set  up  a\r\n\r\nworking  party  to study schemes for export  credit\r\n\r\ninsurance  which will be an important tool  at  the\r\n\r\ndisposal of our exporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the hon. Member's comments on trade\r\n\r\nwith  China,  Members should bear in mind  that  we\r\n\r\ncannot always work solely on the principle that  we\r\n\r\nwill  only  trade  with  countries  which  buy   an\r\n\r\nequivalent amount of goods from us. A trade deficit\r\n\r\nwith  one  country is often counter-balanced  by  a\r\n\r\ntrade surplus with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nanother. That is how international trade works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure\r\n\r\nthe  hon.  Member that we are quite  aware  of  the\r\n\r\ndangers  of  dumping, and where  goods  similar  to\r\n\r\nthose  that are manufactured in Singapore are being\r\n\r\ndumped here, active steps will be taken to see that\r\n\r\nour local industries are not endangered.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Ten minutes past Seven o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1967/19670629/19670629-HA-0260071.pdf\"\">APPENDIX I(Cols 0071-0072)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
