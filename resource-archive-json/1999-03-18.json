As a first step, it corporatised the electricity and  gas\r\n\r\nundertakings of the Public Utilities Board (PUB) on 1st  October\r\n\r\n1995  to  form Singapore Power Ltd (SP).  To facilitate  further\r\n\r\nmeasures  to  introduce  competition, SP  was  structured  as  a\r\n\r\nholding company with five separate subsidiaries.  These are  two\r\n\r\ngeneration   companies   (PowerSeraya   and   PowerSenoko),    a\r\n\r\ntransmission  and  distribution company  (PowerGrid),  a  supply\r\n\r\ncompany (Power Supply) and a piped-gas company (PowerGas),  each\r\n\r\nwith  its own board of directors and independent management.   A\r\n\r\nnew  power station being built in Tuas was put under a  separate\r\n\r\ncompany, Tuas Power Ltd (TP) owned directly by Temasek Holdings,\r\n\r\nso that it could compete against the SP generation companies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since corporatisation, SP has performed well. SP has\r\n\r\nventured overseas, while maintaining an excellent utility system\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.   Productivity has increased sharply.   This  has\r\n\r\nbeen  achieved  through  the  joint efforts  of  management  and\r\n\r\nemployees,  and has enabled SP to offer $720 million  in  tariff\r\n\r\nrebates  as  part  of  the  off-budget cost-cutting  package  in\r\n\r\nNovember last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 1st April 1998, we set up the Singapore Electricity Pool\r\n\r\n(SEP), which is an exchange for trading electricity.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSince  then, PowerSeraya and PowerSenoko have been competing  to\r\n\r\nsell  electricity through the Pool.  More recently,  Tuas  Power\r\n\r\nLtd  has begun bidding to sell electricity into the Pool.   TP's\r\n\r\nfirst  600  MW  unit was commissioned on 1st  March  1999.   The\r\n\r\nsecond  unit (also 600 MW) is expected to commence operation  in\r\n\r\nJanuary 2000.  TP will begin constructing its second stage power\r\n\r\nplants soon, to be operational from year 2001 onwards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides TP, SembCorp Cogen has also been issued with a\r\n\r\nlicence  to  generate  electricity.  The  SembCorp  Cogen  power\r\n\r\nplant,  when operational in year 2001, will generate 650  MW  of\r\n\r\nelectricity for sale into the Singapore Electricity Pool.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reviewing the progress of restructuring in the\r\n\r\nelectricity  industry, the Government has decided  that  as  the\r\n\r\nnext  step, SP should fully divest its two generation  companies\r\n\r\nin  year 2001.  SP will retain the transmission, supply and  gas\r\n\r\noperations, which together form the large part of SP's business.\r\n\r\nPowerSenoko  and  PowerSeraya will  be  transferred  to  Temasek\r\n\r\nHoldings,  the parent company of SP. Temasek Holdings may  bring\r\n\r\nother  suitable shareholders into one or both of the  generation\r\n\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will separate the ownership of generators from the\r\n\r\nownership  of  the transmission and distribution  network.   The\r\n\r\ngenerators   are   the  contestable  part   of   the   industry.\r\n\r\nCompetition between different generators is possible and  should\r\n\r\nbe encouraged, whereas the transmission grid is non-contestable,\r\n\r\nbecause  it  is  a  natural monopoly.  This  split  between  the\r\n\r\ncontestable  and the non-contestable parts of the industry  will\r\n\r\nassure  all  generators  of a level playing  field  and  enhance\r\n\r\ncompetition in the industry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this change in the structure of the power\r\n\r\nindustry,  Temasek Holdings is reviewing the divestment  process\r\n\r\nof Tuas Power.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this decision to hive off PowerSenoko and\r\n\r\nPowerSeraya from SP, my Ministry has been mindful of its  impact\r\n\r\non  SP and its staff.  Government's intention to list SP and  to\r\n\r\nstructure  the public listing as an asset enhancement  programme\r\n\r\nremains unchanged.  SP's regionalisation effort will also not be\r\n\r\naffected,  as  SP  can  still  leverage  on  the  expertise   of\r\n\r\ngeneration  companies  within the  Temasek  group  for  overseas\r\n\r\nventures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restructuring will directly affect the employees of the\r\n\r\ntwo generation companies.  SP management has therefore explained\r\n\r\nthe  plans  to  the union, which is the Union of Power  and  Gas\r\n\r\nEmployees  (UPAGE).   The  union  has  expressed  to  management\r\n\r\nworkers' concerns, including job security, status of employment,\r\n\r\nand  the  terms and conditions of service.  SP has assisted  the\r\n\r\nunion  in  getting the reassurance that this transfer is  not  a\r\n\r\ndown-sizing  exercise  but  a planned  evolution  of  the  power\r\n\r\nindustry.   Hence,  there will be no change  in  the  terms  and\r\n\r\nconditions  of the employment contracts, and no retrenchment  at\r\n\r\nthe  time  of  ownership  change.

I think it will be very difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read the Chinese version of Shakespeare's works, I\r\n\r\nmust first of all find out whether it was translated by the best\r\n\r\ntranslator.   Even  then,  I cannot be  sure  whether  the  best\r\n\r\ntranslator   can   translate  100%  of   the   quintessence   of\r\n\r\nShakespeare's  works and the intricacies of the English  culture\r\n\r\nat  that time.  Sir, it may not be very difficult to find a good\r\n\r\nChinese  translator.  But, to get a very good Chinese translator\r\n\r\nwho can genuinely understand the famous works of Shakespeare and\r\n\r\nthe English culture will be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after reading the Chinese translation of Shakespeare's\r\n\r\nworks,  I  tell my English-educated friends that I have  already\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  quintessence and  intricacies  of  the  English\r\n\r\nculture,  I  will  certainly make a laughing  stock  of  myself.\r\n\r\nLikewise,  if my English-educated friend tells me  that  he  has\r\n\r\nread  the English translation of the Chinese classics,  and  has\r\n\r\ntherefore  fully  understood  the  quitessence  of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture, I will just dismiss it with a laugh.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bilingual language system implemented by the\r\n\r\nSingapore  Government  all  these  years  is  a  very  important\r\n\r\neducation  policy.   It  has at least  trained  Singaporeans  to\r\n\r\nconcurrently know two languages.  If we say now that  they  know\r\n\r\ntwo  languages  (with  English as the main language  and  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  as the supplementary language) and our students will  be\r\n\r\nable to understand the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nessence  and intricacies of their own culture,  it will   hardly\r\n\r\nbe convincing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, only very few Singaporeans are truly effectively\r\n\r\nbilingual.   Most  Singaporeans  are  proficient  only  in   one\r\n\r\nlanguage  and concurrently know another language.  If they  only\r\n\r\n\"concurrently know\" and are not proficient in Chinese, they  can\r\n\r\nspeak  and  listen, but not so good in reading and  writing,  it\r\n\r\nwill  be  very  difficult for them to genuinely  understand  and\r\n\r\npreserve the quintessence of Chinese culture.  They may  perhaps\r\n\r\nfeel that although they are not proficient in Chinese, they  can\r\n\r\nstill preserve the essence of Chinese culture through the use of\r\n\r\nother  languages.  This is unrealistic.  I have spent a  lot  of\r\n\r\ntime  reading  and studying a Chinese translation  of  the  Holy\r\n\r\nQuoran.   Until  now,  I can only say that I  know  the  Islamic\r\n\r\nteachings of my Malay compatriots a bit more than before.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I feel that people from different language\r\n\r\nbackgrounds  may  be  able to understand  another  language  and\r\n\r\nculture  through  translation, but it will  still  be  extremely\r\n\r\ndifficult for them to fully comprehend the quintessence of  that\r\n\r\nculture and strike up a sympathetic chord with it.  In my  view,\r\n\r\nmost people can acquire only superficial understanding this way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the ancient Chinese classic \"Chronicles by Zuo Qiuming\",\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  saying, \" With the skin gone, what  can  the  hair\r\n\r\nadhere  to?\" - meaning a person or thing cannot exist without  a\r\n\r\nbasis.   Therefore,  I urge the Ministry of Education  to  avoid\r\n\r\nthinking  that  one  could  learn the quintessence  of  his  own\r\n\r\nculture through another language.  Only if our students can make\r\n\r\nconscientious  efforts to pragmatically learn their  own  mother\r\n\r\ntongue,  can  they  preserve the essence of their  own  culture.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  Chinese  culture  is rich  and  profound  with  great\r\n\r\ncompatibility with and accommodation for other foreign cultures.\r\n\r\nThis  will  indeed be very important for a multi-racial,  multi-lingual society in Singapore.  This will indeed be of great help\r\n\r\nto Singapore's future development.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the\r\n\r\nPrime Minister said in his National Day Message in 1997 that our\r\n\r\nstandard  of  Chinese should be enhanced so that we can  nurture\r\n\r\nour  Chinese  elite.   This  is very important  because  of  the\r\n\r\nregional  needs.  The Chinese market is now open.  To  establish\r\n\r\nbetter  trade relations with China, we need to have  people  who\r\n\r\nhave  good  command of the Chinese language.  The Chinese  elite\r\n\r\ncan  also  contribute  in  the fields of  journalism,  politics,\r\n\r\neducation, the arts and the community.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Chinese family should cultivate and practise\r\n\r\nConfucian  teachings, such as honour the elder and  respect  the\r\n\r\nwise,  filial piety and harmonious relations.  In order  to  let\r\n\r\nthe  5%  of our students who have difficulties learning Chinese,\r\n\r\nthe  Government  has proposed to set up a CL  (B)  programme  to\r\n\r\nencourage  them  to carry on studying Chinese  and  learn  their\r\n\r\nmother  tongue.   On the other hand, to attract more  people  to\r\n\r\nlearn Chinese at a higher level, more students will be given the\r\n\r\nopportunity to take Higher Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent dialogue session of the Feedback Unit, out of\r\n\r\n32 attendees, 27, ie, 85%, supported this move.  I hope that the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education  would ensure that  the  principals  and\r\n\r\nteachers  of our schools will understand the intention  of  this\r\n\r\nnew  policy, give it their full support so that the  new  policy\r\n\r\ncan achieve the desired results.\r\n\r\n<br>12.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to produce students with a high Chinese standard, we\r\n\r\nneed  to  have high quality teachers.  As such, the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation should take the training of Chinese teachers  strictly\r\n\r\nand  seriously. I would propose that the Ministry  of  Education\r\n\r\nset  up a special college with Chinese elite lecturers to  train\r\n\r\nour  Chinese  teachers to enhance their quality.   At  the  same\r\n\r\ntime,  those who are now serving as Chinese teachers  should  be\r\n\r\nsent  to this college or even overseas for specialised training,\r\n\r\nso  that  their  standard of Chinese and their pedagogy  can  be\r\n\r\nfurther improved, and their professionalism\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nenhanced.   This is particularly important for Chinese  teachers\r\n\r\nwho  are now 40 years of age and above.  By now, they would have\r\n\r\nbeen  teaching for some 20 years or more.  They should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  opportunity  to  attend some refresher courses  to  upgrade\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether there is a long-term plan to ensure that we have sufficient qualified Chinese\r\n\r\nteachers to teach Chinese and Higher Chinese to meet our  future\r\n\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):\r\n\r\nSir, I wish to declare my interest.  I am a teacher.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the learning of the mother tongue has been made\r\n\r\ncompulsory  for  students in all schools.   Proficiency  in  the\r\n\r\nmother tongue will enable our students to inherit the culture of\r\n\r\nthis  community  from  the  older  generation.   Recently,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of Education has decided to allow more Malay  students\r\n\r\nto study Malay at Higher Malay level (HML) in secondary schools.\r\n\r\nThis is most welcome by the Malay community.  Today, 30% of  the\r\n\r\nbest Malay students at PSLE are allowed to take HML.  More Malay\r\n\r\nstudents  will  have the opportunity to study  Higher  Malay  at\r\n\r\nSecondary One level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the increasing number of students, I would\r\n\r\nlike  to ask if the Ministry of Education has provided competent\r\n\r\nteachers  to  teach  Higher Malay effectively.   Following  that\r\n\r\nmove,  I would like to ask if Higher Malay will continue  to  be\r\n\r\ntaught  at  Junior  College and whether  Malay  Studies  in  the\r\n\r\nNational University of Singapore can be taught at Honours level.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay community needs students who are proficient\r\n\r\nin  Malay  who  would take over from the current specialists  in\r\n\r\nMalay  such as Cikgu Mohamed Arif, Cikgu Masuri, Cikgu Suratman,\r\n\r\nand  so  on.  I would like to ask the Minister for Education  if\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Education will set up a committee to study  the\r\n\r\nteaching  and  learning of Malay language  in  Singapore.   This\r\n\r\ncommittee, I feel, will be able to make a study as to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwhether  the  Malay  community wants an  SAP  school  for  Malay\r\n\r\nstudents or not.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, we do not need a SAP school for Malay students.\r\n\r\nWhat  has happened to the two well-known Malay schools, ie, Sang\r\n\r\nNila  Utama  and  Tun Sri Lanang Secondary Schools,  will  be  a\r\n\r\nlesson  for  our community.  To me, the move by the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  today to place the top Malay students in  12  of  the\r\n\r\nbest  schools such as Raffles Institution, RGS, Tanjong  Katong,\r\n\r\nCedar  and Victoria Schools, and so on, is a wise move.   And  I\r\n\r\nfeel that if there are 30% of the top Malay students, the number\r\n\r\nwill  be  about 500.  Certainly, the number of schools allocated\r\n\r\nwill  be  increased.  At these schools, they  will  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncompete  with  students from other races of  equal  calibre  and\r\n\r\nmaybe  even better.  So they will have the opportunity to  study\r\n\r\nand  interact  with other races.  We can expect  this  group  of\r\n\r\nstudents,  who  will  be scholars of the community,  to  be  the\r\n\r\nprofessionals  who will be the pride of the Malay  community  in\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that the Ministry provide\r\n\r\nadditional  teachers  to  teach  Higher  Malay  (HML)  in  these\r\n\r\nschools.   These schools will not only be able to  teach  Higher\r\n\r\nMalay  and also outside the curriculum hours, they can introduce\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  students to the culture, literature and heritage  of\r\n\r\nthe  Malay  community.  In this way, we will ensure a  group  of\r\n\r\nMalay  scholars  who  will be the role  models  of  the  younger\r\n\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister could give consideration to these\r\n\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr S.

In\r\n\r\nrecent  times,  the Indian students, parents as  well  as  Tamil\r\n\r\nteachers,  have  expressed much concern over this  matter.   The\r\n\r\nfeedback  is  that  the standard and content of  Tamil  language\r\n\r\nshould reflect the fact that it is being taught and learned as a\r\n\r\nsecond  language  within  the Singaporean  context.

Firstly,  will  the review be completed  in  time  for\r\n\r\nimplementation in the year 2000 so that another academic year is\r\n\r\nnot  lost?

Thirdly, will the scope  of  the\r\n\r\nreview  cover  the  recruitment, deployment and  development  of\r\n\r\nTamil  teachers? In particular, will the Ministry be considering\r\n\r\ninitiatives  to enable students to learn Tamil in  their  school\r\n\r\nduring curriculum time rather than having to go to Tamil centres\r\n\r\nafter school?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister for an update on the\r\n\r\nestablishment  of a Department for South-Asian  Studies  at  the\r\n\r\ntertiary level.  When will it start offering courses and will  a\r\n\r\nTamil module be included?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, at a recent sitting of\r\n\r\nthis House last year, I had said that the learning of our mother\r\n\r\ntongue  gives  us a sense of identity and bearing in  our  moral\r\n\r\nconduct.   I  thought  then,  and I  still  maintain  now,  that\r\n\r\nlearning  the mother tongue would help us preserve our  cultural\r\n\r\nroots  and  give us a sense of identity.  I also said then  that\r\n\r\nthe  experience  of  the Chinese in Singapore  is  unique,  only\r\n\r\nbecause  we  are  geographically cut off from the  others.   Our\r\n\r\nexperience may not be compared with the experience of the  other\r\n\r\nethnic  Chinese  in  Taiwan, China  or  Hong  Kong.   There  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  an  increasing divergence in  the  manner  in  which\r\n\r\ncultural  norms and practices are carried out.   Two,  three  or\r\n\r\nfour generations down the road, I am not sure if the Chinese  in\r\n\r\nSingapore can say that we are culturally the same as the Chinese\r\n\r\nelsewhere  in  the  world.  Just take a look at  the  third  and\r\n\r\nfourth generations of American born Chinese.  If you listened to\r\n\r\nthem  speak  with  your eyes closed, you would be  forgiven  for\r\n\r\nmistaking that it is a non-Chinese who is speaking.  How Chinese\r\n\r\nare they?  Could their parents have prevented the tide of change\r\n\r\nby  forcing  the learning of the second language on them?   Will\r\n\r\ntheir children or\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntheir  grandchildren be as Chinese as they are 20  to  30  years\r\n\r\ndown the road?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the SAP schools and the policy of\r\n\r\nproducing a new breed of Chinese cultural elites to my mind only\r\n\r\nserves to slow down the inevitable tide of change.  The cultural\r\n\r\nnorms of the Chinese in Singapore will continue to evolve  in  a\r\n\r\nway  that  is totally divorced from the developments in  Taiwan,\r\n\r\nChina and Hong Kong.  Yes, there will be the external influences\r\n\r\nfrom  these countries.  However, the development of the  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture  in Singapore will not be the same.  We have  to  accept\r\n\r\nit.   Up  until now, there has to my mind never been  any  clear\r\n\r\npolicy  statement on the part of our Government as to the extent\r\n\r\nto  which Chinese in Singapore should preserve their Chineseness\r\n\r\nvis-a-vis their mainland counterparts.  Be that as it may, there\r\n\r\nare clear indications that we are losing our edge on our Chinese\r\n\r\nspeaking  ability.   We  learn  that  an  increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nhouseholds  in  Singapore are using English as the  language  of\r\n\r\ncommunication rather than Chinese.  Even in households where the\r\n\r\nparents speak Chinese well, English is often substituted as  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  of  choice.  Just looking at some  of  the  programmes\r\n\r\nhosted by our Chinese comperes, many Chinese-speaking friends of\r\n\r\nmine  had commented that they are still some distance away  from\r\n\r\ntheir  counterparts in mainland China or Taiwan.   Someone  once\r\n\r\nsaid in an exaggerated manner if only to prove a point, that our\r\n\r\ncounterparts on television in China rattle off at 1,500 words  a\r\n\r\nminute  whereas  we rattle off at 800 words a minute,  and  even\r\n\r\nthen,  we make mistakes.  This limitation on our ability in  the\r\n\r\nChinese language did not come by chance.  Our people suffer from\r\n\r\na  real  handicap  from speaking Chinese well, compared  to  the\r\n\r\nethnic speakers of the language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we decided on the policy of ensuring that our\r\n\r\nstandard in the Chinese language is not diluted further  through\r\n\r\nthe  effluxion  of  time.  We have decided  therefore  that  the\r\n\r\nChinese language should be preserved in the form of SAP\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nschools  and  recently  the promotion of  the  Chinese  cultural\r\n\r\nelites  that  was  perhaps to serve as  a  bulwark  against  the\r\n\r\nfurther erosion of our culture and heritage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps unfortunate, Sir, that the promotion and\r\n\r\ndiscussion  of  the  teaching of Chinese in schools  in  a  high\r\n\r\nprofile  and  significant manner, such as the promotion  of  SAP\r\n\r\nschools,  cannot yet be carried out in Singapore at  the  moment\r\n\r\nwithout  the  risk of being misunderstood.  As it is,  the  very\r\n\r\nsuggestion  of  promoting Chinese cultural  elites  is  seen  by\r\n\r\nothers  as possibly raising a new generation of Chinese  leaders\r\n\r\nin Singapore who have little or no contact with minority members\r\n\r\nand who then, when placed in a position of public policy making,\r\n\r\nmake decisions which show very little sympathy for the others.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such fears, with all due respect, do not appear to be\r\n\r\nfounded.  In the first place, I believe that raising a new breed\r\n\r\nof  cultural  elites or the Chinese elites is not  the  same  as\r\n\r\nraising  political  elites, or civil  service  elites.   I  have\r\n\r\nunderstood  the  term  to mean, in the  context  of  our  recent\r\n\r\ndebates, raising a group of Singaporeans who are highly  skilled\r\n\r\nin  the  Chinese  language, so that they  in  turn  can  act  as\r\n\r\ncustodians of the standard and quality of the spoken and written\r\n\r\nChinese in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, even if some of these cultural elites do become\r\n\r\npolicy makers, it would be wrong to assume that having spent six\r\n\r\nto 12 years in a Chinese speaking environment, these people will\r\n\r\nnot  have  any sympathy for the minorities.  We seem  to  assume\r\n\r\nthat  these  people live in a vacuum and would have  no  contact\r\n\r\nwith  the  minority races.  We have forgotten that  80%  of  our\r\n\r\nChinese  in  Singapore live in housing estates which are  multi-racial  in composition.  We have also forgotten that we have  to\r\n\r\ndo  National  Service which is also multi-racial in composition.\r\n\r\nIn  my own experience, I went to a school that did not have many\r\n\r\nmembers  of the minority groups.  Most of my friends  then  were\r\n\r\npredominantly Chinese.  It did not matter for me, because  right\r\n\r\nfrom  young,  the  school taught me to respect the  customs  and\r\n\r\nbeliefs of others who are\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnot  like  me.  The society that I operated in believes  in  the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial   principle  and  expects  me  to  conduct   myself\r\n\r\naccordingly.   When I served my country in national  service,  I\r\n\r\nhad  plenty of opportunity to interact with the minority members\r\n\r\nand  I got along well with them.  I never had any problem  if  I\r\n\r\nhad  to  fight to save my fellow Singaporean who may  not  be  a\r\n\r\nChinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a multi-racial country and will continue\r\n\r\nto  be so.  Having said that, I would like to say that there are\r\n\r\na number of principles that we should observe.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are never a melting pot of cultures and should\r\n\r\nnever be.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should maintain our distinct identity and let\r\n\r\nit  evolve  in its natural and different way.  As  I  have  said\r\n\r\nearlier,  we can never be as Chinese as the Chinese in  mainland\r\n\r\nChina;  and  I  am not sure whether we want to  be.   We  should\r\n\r\ntherefore  not insist on maintaining standards at all costs,  as\r\n\r\nit  may  come across as being chauvinistic to others.  We should\r\n\r\nnot  be  ashamed to say that as Chinese, our cultural  practices\r\n\r\nhave evolved in its own unique way.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, each ethnic group in Singapore must accept and\r\n\r\nrespect  the desire of other ethnic groups to maintain  its  own\r\n\r\nidentity  through its cultural practices, including the teaching\r\n\r\nof  the mother tongue so long as these practices do not harm  or\r\n\r\naffect  the interest of the larger society.  In this regard,  we\r\n\r\ncannot  demand,  for  instance, that schools  run  by  the  clan\r\n\r\nassociations  and  which have a history  of  providing  a  total\r\n\r\nenvironment for the teaching of the mother tongue be required to\r\n\r\nteach  non-Chinese as second language and, in the process, alter\r\n\r\nthe  character  of  the school.  As long  as  there  are  enough\r\n\r\nschools  in  the  area, there is no compelling reason  why  long\r\n\r\nestablished policies should change.\r\n\r\n<br>1.00 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, our belief in maintaining our separate and\r\n\r\ndistinct identity should always be subordinated to the demands\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nof  national and social cohesion.  While we want to preserve and\r\n\r\npromote our mother tongue and prevent it from being adulterated,\r\n\r\nwe  should be aware that rifts may be created within our society\r\n\r\nas  well.  We are at the moment beginning to see indications  of\r\n\r\nthis.  Take the teaching of Chinese language, for instance.   We\r\n\r\nhave over the years evolved the teaching of the Chinese language\r\n\r\nto  the extent that we have differentiated between those who are\r\n\r\nable  to take Chinese at first level and those who are not.   In\r\n\r\nclass  and status conscious Singapore, this is a constant source\r\n\r\nof  pressure  and unhappiness.  And now, we have created  a  new\r\n\r\nsuper  class of the Chinese elites, giving much concern  to  the\r\n\r\nothers about how this would affect our multiracial society as we\r\n\r\nknow it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, care should be given when relocating clan\r\n\r\nschools  that do not offer Chinese as a second language  to  the\r\n\r\nresidential  neighbourhoods.  It would surely be  a  recipe  for\r\n\r\nunhappiness  if  the  school was the only school  within  a  one\r\n\r\nkilometre radius and the minority groups are told that they  are\r\n\r\nnot  eligible to apply and would have to go elsewhere where they\r\n\r\nmay not have any priority in admitting their children.  I am not\r\n\r\nsaying that our language policies at the moment have resulted in\r\n\r\nany  undermining  of  our national unity that  we  enjoy  today.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would say that if in maintaining our present language\r\n\r\npolicies, there is a great deal of unhappiness to a point  where\r\n\r\nsocial  cohesion is eroded in the process, the Government should\r\n\r\nstep  back  and reassess its bearings to see if it is worth  the\r\n\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in reviewing the Ministry's policy on the teaching of\r\n\r\nmother tongue, I would urge the Minister to bear in mind what  I\r\n\r\nhave just said.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  efforts to improve the teaching of  mother  tongues,\r\n\r\nthe  quality  of  teachers should be given  emphasis.   This  is\r\n\r\nrelevant to all mother tongues.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of Malay language teaching in schools, the\r\n\r\nyounger  Malay  teachers,  like most  other  young  teachers  in\r\n\r\nSingapore, are likely to have had an English-based education and\r\n\r\nmost  would have taken Malay as a second language.  With  regard\r\n\r\nto  this, how competent are they in teaching ML1 or higher level\r\n\r\nMalay?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Education has stated that the percentage\r\n\r\nof  students taking ML1 will be increased from 20% to 30%.   Are\r\n\r\nthere  currently enough Malay Language teachers to  be  able  to\r\n\r\ncope with an increase of students from 350 at present levels  to\r\n\r\n500  in  the  next  year?   If we are short  of  Malay  language\r\n\r\nteachers, how will the Ministry increase the number?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other professions that are based on vernacular\r\n\r\nlanguages, for example, journalism in Mandarin, Tamil and  Malay\r\n\r\nin Singapore, we are likely to see continued shortage of capable\r\n\r\npeople  to teach the mother tongues, particularly at the  higher\r\n\r\nlanguage  level.   We  can always look  at  the  possibility  of\r\n\r\nrecruiting suitable teachers from overseas to fill the need  for\r\n\r\nsuch  teachers.  But we can actually still tap the local  talent\r\n\r\npool  for language teaching if we provide the proper incentives.\r\n\r\nThe  Ministry should consider offering scholarship to `A'  level\r\n\r\nholders who are deemed capable to teach the mother tongues at  a\r\n\r\nhigher level.  At the same time, the Ministry should also  state\r\n\r\nclearly  that  second language teachers who have the  leadership\r\n\r\npotential stand a chance to be promoted not just up to the level\r\n\r\nof senior subject teacher, but also to the level of Principal or\r\n\r\nVice-Principal.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,\r\n\r\nlast year, the Government announced a new policy on the teaching\r\n\r\nof  Chinese  Language.  Since then,  there  have  been  numerous\r\n\r\ndebates,  and  both  educators and laymen  have  expressed  keen\r\n\r\ninterest   on  the  subject.   Judging  from  the   new   policy\r\n\r\npromulgated, the Government's approach is very pragmatic for  it\r\n\r\nnot only concerns itself\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith the nurturing of Chinese elite, but also takes heed of  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  Chinese  language to be learnt by everybody,  and  to\r\n\r\ncreate  an environment conducive to the learning and application\r\n\r\nof  Chinese.  In this regard, the policy has laid down  a  solid\r\n\r\nfoundation.  However, I would like to raise a question on the CL\r\n\r\n`B' course which many people are concerned with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, there are indeed some students who have found\r\n\r\nthe  learning of Chinese an uphill struggle because  of  certain\r\n\r\nspecial  background and lack of conducive conditions,  and  have\r\n\r\ntherefore lost interest.  Some people are even worried that this\r\n\r\nwill affect the future prospects of these students.  In order to\r\n\r\nhelp these students, the Government has devised an easier CL `B'\r\n\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in reply to my question on 11th February, the\r\n\r\nMinister for Education stated categorically that no student will\r\n\r\nbe  deprived of a place in the university just because  of  poor\r\n\r\nperformance  in  his mother tongue.  Students  who  have  failed\r\n\r\ntheir mother tongue were not successful in gaining admission  to\r\n\r\nthe  university because their results in the other subjects were\r\n\r\nalso not up to the required standard.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, relevant figures published by the Ministry of\r\n\r\nEducation in the newspapers on 1st February showed that only  1%\r\n\r\nof  the  `O'  level  and `A' level students failed  in  Chinese.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ministry, only 260 students out of last  year's\r\n\r\ncohort  of 26,000 failed their Chinese papers.  This shows  that\r\n\r\nthe  vast  majority  of students do not  face  too  much  of  an\r\n\r\nobstacle in learning Chinese.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot help asking, \"Why do we go through all the\r\n\r\ntrouble  and  mobilize so much resources to set up  the  CL  `B'\r\n\r\ncourse  just to cater for this small group of 200-odd students?\"\r\n\r\nSome  people  may  even  say that the Government  is  \"making  a\r\n\r\nmountain  out of a mole-hill\".  Moreover, the failure  of  these\r\n\r\nstudents may well be due to some complex factors, involving  the\r\n\r\nlearning environment and the attitude of the students. This is a\r\n\r\nproblem that cannot be resolved just by lowering the standard of\r\n\r\nthe curriculum.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we must not neglect the plight of this small\r\n\r\ngroup  of students and their future.  But looking at it  from  a\r\n\r\nwider perspective, to formulate a new course will entail a  huge\r\n\r\namount of manpower, financial and material resources.  Will this\r\n\r\nbe  in  keeping  with practical economic efficiency?   Moreover,\r\n\r\nunder  our  present  secondary  education  system,  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage course has already been split into \"Higher Chinese\" and\r\n\r\n\"Ordinary  Chinese\"  to suit the progress  of  learning  of  the\r\n\r\nstudents.   Now, we are going to have yet another lower-standard\r\n\r\nCL  `B'.   Will this not lead to uneven standards in the Chinese\r\n\r\nlanguage in our schools?  Besides, will the students who opt  to\r\n\r\ntake  CL  `B'  not  become  \"extra-territorial  beings\"  and  be\r\n\r\nalienated  from the present mainstream Chinese?   What  is  more\r\n\r\nworrying is that by the use of this \"downgrading\" method to help\r\n\r\nthe students learn their Chinese, the effect may well be counter-productive.   The  end-result is: students will  avoid  learning\r\n\r\ntheir mother tongue, become opportunistic and take the easy  way\r\n\r\nout.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To students who are weak in Chinese, we must suit the\r\n\r\nmedicine  to  the illness, and give them ample opportunities  of\r\n\r\nstudy  and immersion. Use more counselling and flexible  methods\r\n\r\nof  teaching, to enable them to master Chinese by following  the\r\n\r\nprescribed order according to the curriculum indicators, thereby\r\n\r\nenhancing their interest in the learning of the Chinese language\r\n\r\nand literature.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree with the Government's decision to set the\r\n\r\nuniversity  admission  criteria based on  a  point  system,  and\r\n\r\nstudents  who fail to obtain the minimum pass of a D7  in  their\r\n\r\nmother  tongue will be granted a provisional admission, provided\r\n\r\nthe  said  students enrol for a one-month mother  tongue  course\r\n\r\nduring  the  University Year I vacation and pass the  prescribed\r\n\r\nexamination thereof.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I firmly believe that if the university can continue to\r\n\r\nimplement  this norm of strengthening the students' learning  of\r\n\r\ntheir mother tongue, ensure that the students have adequate time\r\n\r\nto learn their mother tongue, and adopt flexible\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nteaching  methods, it can prevent the students  from  alienating\r\n\r\nthemselves  from the Chinese mainstream, and at  the  same  time\r\n\r\nenable  the  students to master their Chinese in an  environment\r\n\r\nconducive to learning.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today we are able to live harmoniously with our\r\n\r\nbrothers  of  various  races,  and together  contribute  to  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of our nation.  This can be attributed to the mutual\r\n\r\nunderstanding   and   tolerance   among   the   various   ethnic\r\n\r\ncommunities.  Therefore, we must continue to preserve and uphold\r\n\r\nthe  deep bonding among us and promote mutual cultural exchanges\r\n\r\namong  ourselves.  In view of this, apart from  encouraging  our\r\n\r\npeople  to  learn  their  own  mother  tongue,  we  should  also\r\n\r\nencourage  everyone  to learn the language and  culture  of  the\r\n\r\nother races.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the Ministry conduct non-examination courses\r\n\r\non  ethnic  languages and cultures in the primary and  secondary\r\n\r\nschools  as an optional subject or an extra-curricular activity.\r\n\r\nThis will provide our students with better understanding of  the\r\n\r\nother ethnic communities and improve communications among them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially so for the Malay language. It is not\r\n\r\nonly  one  of our official languages, but also the main  working\r\n\r\nlanguage of our immediate neighbours. Therefore, encouraging our\r\n\r\npeople  to learn Malay and understand the culture of our  fellow\r\n\r\ncitizens  not only helps to enhance our social cohesiveness  but\r\n\r\nis  also an important way to promote friendly dealings with  and\r\n\r\nbetter  understanding  of  our people  and  the  people  of  our\r\n\r\nneighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that the Ministry of Education will give the\r\n\r\nproposal  of offering the option of CL `B' a further and  deeper\r\n\r\nre-thinking.  Make an overall evaluation of the pros  and  cons,\r\n\r\nso as not to commit the mistake of \"trying to save a little only\r\n\r\nto  lose a lot\".  At the same time, please give my suggestion of\r\n\r\nhaving  non-examination courses on ethnic languages and  culture\r\n\r\nsome serious consideration.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to remind Members that\r\n\r\n\"guillotine\" time is at 1.55 pm and I urge them to be very brief\r\n\r\nin their speeches.

He has made us all proud and the Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity  proud.   This is the first time I  am  hearing  Tamil\r\n\r\nsince  I  entered the House.  I hope more Tamil will  be  heard.\r\n\r\nThe only Tamil here is the translated Tamil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore's bilingual policy has been the cornerstone\r\n\r\nof  our  education.  I applaud the Government's  and  Minister's\r\n\r\nassurance  that  it  will be so, despite SAP schools  and  other\r\n\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to continue where Mr Iswaran has left.\r\n\r\nAs  far as the Indian community is concerned, in fact last year,\r\n\r\nI  rose to speak on the question of Tamil language, and being  a\r\n\r\nsmall community, we do not have the resources to propagate Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage as the other communities have.  Therefore, I would urge\r\n\r\nthe  Government to give us a helping hand which we need.   Being\r\n\r\nthe  underdogs,  we  require  some help  and  support  from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and the community at large.\r\n\r\n<br>1.15 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this problem that, in many schools in\r\n\r\nSingapore, there are not enough Tamil teachers.  So the children\r\n\r\nhave  to  go to another school in the afternoon.  May I  make  a\r\n\r\nsuggestion to the Minister?  Probably, we should appoint  roving\r\n\r\nteachers  who could cover two neighbouring schools.   The  other\r\n\r\nalternative  is this.  This has been experimented in  the  Hindi\r\n\r\ncentre  which  runs  Hindu classes.  There are  many  expatriate\r\n\r\nteachers  from  India  who  have settled  here.   In  fact,  the\r\n\r\nexperience of the Hindu Centre is that most of the teachers were\r\n\r\ntrained in India and they have done very well.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCould I suggest to the Minister to try and get these teachers on\r\n\r\na  part-time basis?  They could cover many schools and, in  this\r\n\r\nway, the Tamil students will not be disadvantaged.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other problem, which I feel ought to be also addressed,\r\n\r\nis  the  question of standard, to which the Minister and BG  Lee\r\n\r\nhave  both  given  assurance.  It is important  for  the  Indian\r\n\r\ncommunity,  especially the Tamil community,  that  the  language\r\n\r\nwhich  we  are going to teach the students reflects the existing\r\n\r\nstandard.   Let  us not take Tamil Nadu as our  yardstick.   Our\r\n\r\nlinguistic requirements and our environment are different.   So,\r\n\r\nwe must nurture the Tamil language.  I am glad that Tamil Murasu\r\n\r\nis  doing its best and I am happy that its circulation is  going\r\n\r\nup.   But  what is required is an effort to see that  the  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage is reflective of our standard here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area, which I would like to ask the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider,  is  Higher Tamil.  Because, as my  Malay  friend,  Mr\r\n\r\nHawazi,  earlier pointed out, most of the Indian students  offer\r\n\r\nTamil,  as  a  second language, and unlike the SAP schools,  the\r\n\r\nstandard will definitely be lower.  I would urge the Minister to\r\n\r\nconsider  ways and means of having more Tamil students  offering\r\n\r\nTamil at higher level.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I just\r\n\r\nlike  to  ask  the  Minister whether he would consider  allowing\r\n\r\nschool  premises to be used for religious classes  after  office\r\n\r\nhours  at certain designated schools, and, of course, taught  by\r\n\r\nreligious  teachers from outside.  I say this because  for  some\r\n\r\nparents  who want to have their children to have both  religious\r\n\r\nand  secular education, they can go to aided or mission schools.\r\n\r\nFor  others, they go to secular schools in the day, for example,\r\n\r\nand  the  later  part of the day, they go to religious  schools.\r\n\r\nThe travelling time is quite difficult for the children.  But on\r\n\r\na  broader side, I thought if we can somehow teach religion in a\r\n\r\nmore  secular environment, I think there is a wider  benefit  to\r\n\r\nstudents  and  to all of us.  Of course, schools can  be  better\r\n\r\nutilised  and  perhaps  we  can keep these  students  longer  in\r\n\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Sir,\r\n\r\nfirst, I would like to acknowledge and thank Members and members\r\n\r\nof  the  public as well for the many useful suggestions and  the\r\n\r\nfeedback  that  they  have provided.  We  will  take  this  into\r\n\r\naccount  when  we  design  our systems and  recommendations  for\r\n\r\nmother tongue languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I wish to re-affirm our policy objective in the\r\n\r\nteaching  of  mother tongue, which is to have every  Singaporean\r\n\r\nstudy his mother tongue for as long as possible, and to as  high\r\n\r\na  level as possible.  I note the concerns expressed by  Mr  Tay\r\n\r\nBeng  Chuan  on the CL `B' syllabus.  I would like  to  reassure\r\n\r\nMembers that strong incentives and disincentives will be put  in\r\n\r\nplace to encourage students to offer CL, rather than CL `B',  if\r\n\r\nthey  have the ability to handle the CL.  The reason why we  are\r\n\r\ndoing this, as we have stated earlier in this House, is that out\r\n\r\nof  the  top 30% of students, one in 10 of them is in the bottom\r\n\r\n30%  for  CL.   Out  of  the  top 30% of  students  in  English,\r\n\r\nMathematics and Science, one out of 10 is at the bottom  30%  of\r\n\r\nCL.   So there is some concern in this area, and it leads us  to\r\n\r\nbelieve  that there is a difference in distribution  of  ability\r\n\r\nwhen  it  comes to language versus other subjects.  The Ministry\r\n\r\nis  studying  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  CL  `B'\r\n\r\nsyllabus,  and we should be ready to announce the details  later\r\n\r\nthis year.  Yesterday, I have already explained the reasons  for\r\n\r\narriving at our current bilingual policy in our schools and I do\r\n\r\nnot propose to go through that again.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua has said that to imbibe culture properly,\r\n\r\nstudents  must  master the language, and being able  to  listen,\r\n\r\nunderstand  and  speak the language are not good  enough.   They\r\n\r\nmust  possess  good,  perhaps outstanding  reading  and  writing\r\n\r\nskills as well.  I completely agree with Mr Peh.  Obviously,  if\r\n\r\nyou  have the mastery of the language, you can imbibe and absorb\r\n\r\nthe  culture much better.  But that is not the point.  The point\r\n\r\nthat  we are trying to address, at least in part of the proposal\r\n\r\nfor  the  CL  programme, is that for those who have difficulties\r\n\r\ncoping with the language, are we better off also to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngive them some sense of the richness of the culture, even though\r\n\r\nit  is via other languages than not to try at all?  I think that\r\n\r\nis  the  point.   But  it is quite clear that  if  you  want  to\r\n\r\ncompletely  imbibe the culture and the richness of the  culture,\r\n\r\nit is best done in its own language.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other non-language written sources of\r\n\r\nculture  which are very good.  For example, there are a  lot  of\r\n\r\naudio-visual  materials, and a great deal about Chinese  culture\r\n\r\nhas  been written by people who have studied in other languages.\r\n\r\nI  think  we  should not confine ourselves to just insisting  on\r\n\r\ntransmitting  culture and cultural values via  this  medium.   I\r\n\r\nthink  we  will  be unnecessarily limiting ourselves.   And,  in\r\n\r\nfact,  during  the  Chinese Language Review, many  parents  have\r\n\r\nprovided  feedback of how they got their children, who are  weak\r\n\r\nin  Chinese,  to  be interested in learning more  about  Chinese\r\n\r\nculture  and  folklore  through reading translated  versions  of\r\n\r\nfamous works, such as \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd  perhaps, subsequently, they will then pick up some interest\r\n\r\nand  a greater interest in the language and they want to go back\r\n\r\nto  the  language.   So  I think these are  mutually  supporting\r\n\r\npillars.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incentive we have in place today to encourage students\r\n\r\nto  offer  Higher mother tongue at the secondary  level  is  the\r\n\r\naward of two bonus points for admission to junior colleges,  for\r\n\r\nstudents  who  pass higher mother tongue in the  GCE  `O'  level\r\n\r\nexaminations.  This has increased the pipeline of  students  who\r\n\r\nare doing higher mother tongue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently announced the expansion of the Chinese\r\n\r\nLanguage  Elective  Programme to a third junior  college.   This\r\n\r\nwill  allow  these students to develop themselves  at  a  higher\r\n\r\nlevel  and  to  go on to be able to become part of  the  Chinese\r\n\r\nliterary elite which we are talking about.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent announcement on the teaching and learning of\r\n\r\nChinese language in schools has also elicited feedback from  the\r\n\r\nminority communities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nFirst,   let  me  reiterate  that  students  from  the  minority\r\n\r\ncommunities  will  not be disadvantaged  by  the  changes.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education will apply the same philosophy  for  the\r\n\r\nChinese language to our other mother tongue languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Malay language, I have discussed the current status\r\n\r\nof  the  teaching and learning of ML in schools with  our  Malay\r\n\r\nMPs,  and  we  agreed that it would be useful  to  carry  out  a\r\n\r\nreview,  as suggested by a Member over there.  It is timely  for\r\n\r\nus  to  take  a  look  at ML teaching to  see  if  we  can  make\r\n\r\nimprovements,  and  if  we can do more for  those  doing  Higher\r\n\r\nMalay.  Our initial assessment is that Malay students are faring\r\n\r\nreasonably  well  in  Malay language, but  that  some  non-Malay\r\n\r\nstudents   who   are  doing  Malay  language   may   be   having\r\n\r\ndifficulties.  So, the study will look at this and other areas.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will spearhead this review. I\r\n\r\nhave  invited Minister Abdullah Tarmugi to sit on this Committee\r\n\r\nwith me.  Other members will include Parliamentary Secretary, Mr\r\n\r\nMohamad  Maidin, and our colleague, Mr Hawazi  Daipi.   It  will\r\n\r\nalso  have Ministry of Education officials and language experts.\r\n\r\nThe  Committee  will  have access to all the  resources  of  the\r\n\r\nMinistry,  and  will  seek the views of  parents,  teachers  and\r\n\r\nothers where these are helpful.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review is expected to be completed by about the end of\r\n\r\nMarch  next  year.  Some of the recommendations on the  teaching\r\n\r\nand  learning of Chinese language can be considered for adoption\r\n\r\nfor   the   Malay   language.   In  any   case,   two   specific\r\n\r\nrecommendations  that we will already be implementing,  starting\r\n\r\nfrom  the  year  2000, are the relaxation of  the  criteria  for\r\n\r\nstudents to offer Higher Chinese at Primary 5 and Secondary 1.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Tamil language, a review is already\r\n\r\nunder way.  I expect that this review will take about a year  to\r\n\r\ncomplete  before it is ready to be implemented.  A  TL  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchaired by Mr Iswaran, is providing inputs and feedback  to  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the issues being studied is the standard of TL.\r\n\r\nSome  members of the public have written to the press  to  share\r\n\r\nthe difficulties that their children face in learning TL and, at\r\n\r\nthe  same time, we have other calls that suggest that the  level\r\n\r\nof  TL  is  not quite high enough.  More than 50% of  Primary  1\r\n\r\npupils  offering  TL  today  come  from  predominantly  English-speaking  homes.   As  part  of  the  review,  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nEducation  will carry out an in-depth evaluation of the  current\r\n\r\nTL   syllabus  and  textbooks,  analyse  performance  at   major\r\n\r\nexaminations,  and  gather feedback from students,  parents  and\r\n\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides reviewing the TL syllabus, we will also study\r\n\r\nwhether there is a need for a second TL syllabus, or TL `B', for\r\n\r\nthe  small minority of students who, despite putting in a  great\r\n\r\namount of effort at school and at home, still do badly in TL.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students who are strong in the language, the relaxation\r\n\r\nof  the  criteria  at Primary 5 and Secondary 1  would  also  be\r\n\r\nimplemented for Higher Tamil.  The Ministry will also review the\r\n\r\ncurrent  standard of Higher Tamil, to ensure that it is  pitched\r\n\r\nat  an  appropriate  level,  in relation  to  the  international\r\n\r\nbenchmark,  Tamil  Nadu, but at the same time,  recognising  the\r\n\r\ndifferent   context  within  which  students  learn   Tamil   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Tay Beng Chuan's point on learning yet more\r\n\r\nlanguages, Malay in particular.  Those who are able are  already\r\n\r\nencouraged to do so, and some students do three languages.   But\r\n\r\nthese are exceptionally able students.  For most students,  they\r\n\r\nhave  quite enough on their plate already, by trying  to  master\r\n\r\ntwo languages.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng, Mr Ibrahim bin Othman, Mr Hawazi Daipi\r\n\r\nand Mr Shriniwas Rai have rightly pointed out whether we achieve\r\n\r\nour  intended  objectives  in the teaching  of  mother  tongues,\r\n\r\ndepends  critically on our mother tongue language  teachers.   I\r\n\r\nwould like to assure\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMembers  that the Ministry has been stepping up its  recruitment\r\n\r\nof  mother  tongue language teachers to meet the  needs  of  our\r\n\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of graduates and `A' level holders recruited to\r\n\r\nteach  Chinese language, for example, has increased by four-fold\r\n\r\nsince 1995, to 193 in 1998.  The increase is nearly two-fold for\r\n\r\nMalay  language teachers, to 60 in 1998.  In the case  of  Tamil\r\n\r\nlanguage, the number of teachers recruited has decreased from 44\r\n\r\nin  1995  to  18 in 1998.  This is because of lower  replacement\r\n\r\nneeds, but the recruitment levels are still generally sufficient\r\n\r\nto cover our long-term replacement needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the stepped up recruitment efforts over the past\r\n\r\nthree  years, the staffing situation for mother tongue  teachers\r\n\r\nin  the  schools today is not perfect but relatively good.  With\r\n\r\nthe  current  batch  of NIE trainees posted to  schools  in  the\r\n\r\nmiddle of this year, the average teacher vacancy per school  for\r\n\r\nthe mother tongue languages will be about 0.3.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further increase the pool of mother tongue teachers,\r\n\r\nespecially  for the primary schools, besides the  graduates  and\r\n\r\n`A' level holders, we have introduced a 4-year Diploma in Mother\r\n\r\nTongue  Language Education, started in 1997.  This is to recruit\r\n\r\n`O'  level  holders  who  have done well academically  in  their\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  language, and have the  interest  to  teach  the\r\n\r\nlanguage  at the primary level.  Over the past two years,  about 30\r\n\r\nCL  candidates  per  year  have  been  recruited  into  this\r\n\r\nprogramme.   The figures for ML and TL are 60 and  20  per  year\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The training that teachers undergo in this programme is\r\n\r\nvery  rigorous.   In  the  first two years,  the  mother  tongue\r\n\r\nlanguage  proficiency of the trainee teachers will be raised  to\r\n\r\nat  least  `A'  level standard.  They will study  higher  mother\r\n\r\ntongue and Literature intensively.  In the final two years,  the\r\n\r\ntrainees  will  take pedagogical studies and continue  to  study\r\n\r\nhigher  mother  tongue  and  Literature.   The  first  batch  of\r\n\r\ncandidates from this programme will graduate from NIE and be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndeployed to our primary schools starting in the year 2001.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interim, to ensure enough mother tongue teachers for\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  retired and retiring mother tongue teachers,  who\r\n\r\nhave  a  good  performance  record  will  be  re-employed.   The\r\n\r\nMinistry  will,  at  the same time, also  intensify  its  mother\r\n\r\ntongue  teacher recruitment efforts, both locally and  overseas,\r\n\r\nand we will take the various suggestions into account.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from ensuring that a sufficient number of other\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  teachers are recruited, the Ministry  also  pays\r\n\r\nattention to the quality of the teachers recruited.  The  number\r\n\r\nof  graduates recruited to teach the mother tongue languages has\r\n\r\nnearly doubled from 82 in 1995 to 154 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of teaching scholarships and awards granted for\r\n\r\nother mother tongue language studies has also increased by four-fold,  from  7 in 1995 to 29 in 1998.  More serving non-graduate\r\n\r\nmother  tongue  teachers have also been granted study  leave  to\r\n\r\npursue  a  university degree.  A total of 183 applications  were\r\n\r\napproved  in 1998, and this is a significant increase from  1995\r\n\r\nwhen only 20 applications were approved.\r\n\r\n<br>1.30 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Education recognises the importance of\r\n\r\nconstantly  upgrading  our mother tongue teachers'  proficiency,\r\n\r\nand  ensuring that their teaching methodology remains  relevant.\r\n\r\nBesides  scholarships and awards, seminars, workshops,  training\r\n\r\ncourses  and  briefings  are  organised  on  a  regular   basis.\r\n\r\nExamples of recent training include workshops on the use  of  IT\r\n\r\nin  the  teaching  of  the mother tongue languages.   And  MOE's\r\n\r\ncurriculum  specialists also monitor the teaching of the  mother\r\n\r\ntongue languages to provide teachers with the necessary guidance\r\n\r\nand advice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Mr Hawazi that while it is true that\r\n\r\nthe  younger Malay teachers were educated in the English  medium\r\n\r\nand most of them studied Malay\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nat the second language level, these teachers are native speakers\r\n\r\nof  Malay  and have done well in the subject.  Furthermore,  the\r\n\r\ntraining  at  NIE for Malay language teaching is  intensive  and\r\n\r\ncovers  both  knowledge of the language as well  as  appropriate\r\n\r\nmethodology in language education.  Our young Malay teachers are\r\n\r\ncompetent  teachers  of  the Malay language.   And  those  Malay\r\n\r\nlanguage  teachers who are more experienced or who have  studied\r\n\r\nthe  language  at  higher levels are deployed  to  teach  Higher\r\n\r\nMalay.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to assure Mr Hawazi that mother tongue\r\n\r\nteachers  are  considered for promotion to higher  appointments,\r\n\r\nwhether  they  are  Heads  of Departments,  Vice  Principals  or\r\n\r\nPrincipals  in  the same way as any other teacher is  considered\r\n\r\nfor  appointment to these posts.  The Ministry is always looking\r\n\r\nfor  good  Principals and Vice Principals and it  will  make  no\r\n\r\nsense  for  us to exclude any group if they are able to  perform\r\n\r\nthese roles.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry will continue to intensify its efforts in\r\n\r\nboth  recruitment and training.  The more mother tongue teachers\r\n\r\nwe can recruit, and the better we can equip them with the skills\r\n\r\nto  deliver  lessons  that are interesting and  innovative,  the\r\n\r\nhigher the quality of mother tongue instruction in our schools.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I proceed to some other specific areas that\r\n\r\nMembers have raised?  Firstly, with regard to various studies in\r\n\r\nthe  universities.   There was a question on  Malay  Studies  at\r\n\r\nHonours level.  I think that really depends on whether there  is\r\n\r\na demand from the students.  I will ask NUS to consider this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the South Asian Studies Programme (SASP), this will\r\n\r\nbe  launched at NUS' Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at  the\r\n\r\nbeginning  of  academic year 1999/2000.   Preparations  for  the\r\n\r\nSASP's  implementation have proceeded smoothly, and the  Faculty\r\n\r\nwill  be  ready to admit its first cohort of students  in  July.\r\n\r\nBut we must remember that the South\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAsian  Studies  Programme is not a Tamil Studies Programme,  but\r\n\r\nthere will be Tamil language modules offered as electives.  This\r\n\r\nwill  provide  an  opportunity for those students  who  wish  to\r\n\r\npursue Tamil language at a higher level to do so, but it is  not\r\n\r\nprimarily a Tamil language programme.  Tamil language will  also\r\n\r\nbe  available  as  cross faculty modules to  students  of  other\r\n\r\nfaculties in NUS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of religious education being\r\n\r\nconducted  in  schools.  In fact, today, we do  allow  religious\r\n\r\neducation  to be conducted in schools for preparing students  to\r\n\r\ntake religious knowledge examinations in the approved courses at\r\n\r\nthe  'N'  or  the  'O'  level.  For example,  Islamic  Religious\r\n\r\nKnowledge (IRK) is an elective subject taught outside curriculum\r\n\r\ntime  but  in  schools, and it may be offered in English  or  in\r\n\r\nMalay.   In  1998, I am told there were four schools serving  as\r\n\r\nIRK  centres,  but  this year, because there  are  fewer  pupils\r\n\r\noffering IRK, I think there is only one school offering  IRK  in\r\n\r\nMalay.   So  this  is already possible, but  this  is  only  for\r\n\r\nstudents taking religious knowledge courses which are leading to\r\n\r\nan 'N' or an 'O' level programme.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, I wish to speak on\r\n\r\ntechnical  education, specifically on the Institute of Technical\r\n\r\nEducation (ITE).\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ITE graduates provide the critical pool of technicians\r\n\r\nand  skilled workers in Singapore's economy.  In the  knowledge-based  economy, ITE needs to adjust and adapt their  courses  to\r\n\r\nsuit  the  new  requirements of the manufacturing  and  services\r\n\r\nsectors.   I  wish to ask how is ITE preparing the students  for\r\n\r\nthe new skills and competencies required.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, language proficiency is important in the knowledge\r\n\r\neconomy.   Is language learning given due emphasis  at  ITE?   A\r\n\r\nnumber of students are 'N' level students entering ITE.  I would\r\n\r\nlike to know for those who wish to pursue further to GCE 'O'\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nlevels, what arrangements are being made to help them to do  the\r\n\r\nGCE 'O' levels?  How well are ITE graduates doing to qualify for\r\n\r\npolytechnic education?  Because if many ITE students  know  that\r\n\r\nthere  is a route for upgrading, I think more will be interested\r\n\r\nin ITE education.  Can more be done to improve the number of ITE\r\n\r\ngraduates entering into polytechnics?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE has emphasised the importance of apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining.   Many  parents  and  students,  however,  shun   such\r\n\r\napprenticeship training, because of the long years of commitment\r\n\r\nand,  most  probably, the bonded service.  Enlightened employers\r\n\r\nactually are the ones who like apprenticeship training,  because\r\n\r\nthey  see the value of it, and they know that they would not  be\r\n\r\nable to recruit employees with the specific skills required from\r\n\r\nthe   open   market.    Therefore,  they  are   very   open   to\r\n\r\napprenticeship  training.   Even  in  today's  adverse  business\r\n\r\nconditions,  skilled  workers are the ones keeping  their  jobs.\r\n\r\nITE  graduates with good skills and experience credentials  have\r\n\r\nthe best prospects of stable and secure life-long careers.  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  like to know from the Minister what is being  done  to\r\n\r\nattract more of their students into apprenticeship training.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ITE also suffers from the poor image as an institution of\r\n\r\npoor  achievers.   Unless we remove that  stigma,  it  would  be\r\n\r\ndifficult  to raise the self-esteem of the students and  attract\r\n\r\ngood   students  to  join  them.   The  students  may   not   be\r\n\r\nacademically inclined, but are gifted in technical subjects  and\r\n\r\nin working with their hands.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, many ITE graduates have been successful in\r\n\r\ntheir  jobs and careers.  They serve as good examples  and  role\r\n\r\nmodels to encourage others to follow.  More media promotion  and\r\n\r\npublicity  efforts  should  be  undertaken  to  show  the   vast\r\n\r\nimprovements in training facilities and resources  at  the  ITE.\r\n\r\nIn  fact,  many  of us would be surprised with the  very  modern\r\n\r\nfacilities  that  we  have.  Perhaps ITE  could  work  with  the\r\n\r\ncommunity organisations to change the attitude and perception of\r\n\r\nthe public towards ITE training.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may the Minister respond?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Peter Chen):</b>\r\n\r\nSir,  thank you for allowing me to respond at this time  on  the\r\n\r\npoints on ITE and technical education raised by Mr Loh Meng See.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank Mr Loh, first of all, for pointing\r\n\r\nout  the  critical role played by ITE graduates  in  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomy.   Technical education has indeed been critical  in  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment  of  Singapore into an industrialised  nation.   The\r\n\r\nthousands  of  ITE  and polytechnic graduates  we  have  trained\r\n\r\nconstitute our national human resource of technical skills.  The\r\n\r\nindustries  of  today  and  of the  future  all  require  modern\r\n\r\ntechnology.   They  require  enormous  capital  investment   and\r\n\r\ntechnical  skills  at all levels - the engineer,  the  assistant\r\n\r\nengineer,  supervisor, technician and the common operator.   Our\r\n\r\nITE  and  polytechnic graduates join the ranks of this important\r\n\r\ngroup of people.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we move towards a knowledge-based economy, technical\r\n\r\nskills  remain just as important.  A knowledge-based economy  is\r\n\r\nnot   just  about  producing  new  ideas.   It  is  also   about\r\n\r\nexperimenting,  testing and prototyping  of  ideas.   And,  more\r\n\r\nimportant,  it is the subsequent transformation of  these  ideas\r\n\r\ninto products or services that makes the real money.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole process continues to require the support of\r\n\r\ntechnical  skills in every phase and at all levels.   There  is,\r\n\r\nhowever,  a  new  dimension.  More than ever,  it  requires  our\r\n\r\nworkers  to  have a new mindset, one that requires  them  to  be\r\n\r\nadaptable to rapid technological changes and have a passion  for\r\n\r\ncontinual  life-long learning.  Our polytechnics  and  ITE  have\r\n\r\nalways  stayed  relevant  to the needs and  development  of  our\r\n\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prepare students for the future economy, polytechnics\r\n\r\nand  our ITE have already started to reshape the curriculum  and\r\n\r\nprogrammes.   ITE,  in  particular,  makes  sure  that  students\r\n\r\nundergo  a minimum of 20 hours of ITE basic skills training,  40\r\n\r\nhours of industrial and social studies\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand  80  hours of communication skills training, which  includes\r\n\r\nlanguage  capabilities  in both written  and  oral  presentation\r\n\r\nskills.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of the image of an ITE education, there is\r\n\r\nnothing  to  be  ashamed  of  if we are  not  of  PhD  material.\r\n\r\nHowever, all of us are born with some talent, although  not  all\r\n\r\nof  us are born with the same talent.  My Ministry believes that\r\n\r\nevery  student  should  be developed to his  fullest  potential,\r\n\r\ndepending  on  his  capability  and  interest.   In   1994,   we\r\n\r\nintroduced  the Normal (Technical) Stream in secondary  schools.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure that everyone attains a minimum of 10 years of\r\n\r\nbasic  education  before  he starts his  training  in  technical\r\n\r\nskills.   The  first  cohort of Normal  (Technical)  Stream  was\r\n\r\nadmitted  into  ITE in January 1998.  At the end  of  the  first\r\n\r\nyear,  93% of them passed the first year examinations.  This  is\r\n\r\nthe  same  rate  as  their 'O' level counterparts  in  the  same\r\n\r\ncourses.  They have indeed done well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For students who have a strong technical inclination, ITE's\r\n\r\napprenticeship trainee scheme is an attractive form of technical\r\n\r\ntraining where you earn as you learn.  Apprentices take pride in\r\n\r\ntheir work and are valued for their good technical and practical\r\n\r\nskills.   That  is  why when they complete their  courses,  they\r\n\r\ncommand a higher salary, 20% more than those who complete  full-time institutional training.  I would like to encourage students\r\n\r\nand   parents  to  consider  seriously  the  ITE  apprenticeship\r\n\r\ntraining  as an attractive option to take.  An apprentice  earns\r\n\r\nas much as $800 per month even as he learns.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh mentioned also the reluctance of some parents to\r\n\r\nsend  their  children  to  take up this apprenticeship  training\r\n\r\nscheme, because of bonding.  That is unfortunate.  But fortunate\r\n\r\nin  the  sense  that  today, 85% of the apprenticeship  training\r\n\r\nplaces  do not require bonding.

I  would  like to thank the media  for  the  strong\r\n\r\nsupport given to ITE and its students.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the quality of ITE intake has improved considerably.\r\n\r\n90% of the intake are students from the 'O' and 'N' levels.  ITE\r\n\r\ngraduates  continue  to be widely accepted  by  our  industries.\r\n\r\nDespite  the economic downturn, 96% of ITE graduates  last  year\r\n\r\nmanaged  to obtain their first full-time job offer within  three\r\n\r\nmonths  of  graduation.   The monthly average  salary  has  also\r\n\r\nremained  stable at $1,233 per month.  The proof of the  pudding\r\n\r\nis in the eating!\r\n\r\n<br>1.45 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance which the Government places on technical\r\n\r\neducation is evident in the investment of $371 million in modern\r\n\r\nfacilities for ITE over the last 10 years.  This is in  addition\r\n\r\nto  the  $1.7 billion of infrastructure investment in  the  four\r\n\r\npolytechnics.  ITE today has better facilities, better  teaching\r\n\r\nstaff and better students.  ITE today has earned its name  as  a\r\n\r\nreputable post-secondary institute of technical education.   ITE\r\n\r\ngraduates can walk out of its gates with their heads held  high,\r\n\r\nstraight  into  jobs,  and in many cases,  into  a  polytechnic.\r\n\r\nIndeed,  there  are many role models ITE students and  graduates\r\n\r\ncan  look up to.

After the 400-odd teachers and students  had\r\n\r\nassembled in the school auditorium, the lights went off, and six\r\n\r\nmasked  men  dressed up as Japanese soldiers suddenly  appeared,\r\n\r\nshouting and yelling.  Some students were ordered to kneel down,\r\n\r\nwhile  some  were  forcibly dragged on to the stage.  Some  were\r\n\r\nslapped  and  many  were sobbing and crying.  According  to  the\r\n\r\nStraits  Times report, even some teachers were punished  by  the\r\n\r\n\"Japanese soldiers\" and forced to kneel down facing the stage.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Jin Tai Secondary School exercise has left me with\r\n\r\nsome  deep thinking. Firstly, the teachers and students did  not\r\n\r\nknow  beforehand that this was just an exercise. Secondly, there\r\n\r\nwere  more  than  400  teachers  and  students  and  only  eight\r\n\r\nsimulated \"Japanese soldiers\", including the two standing  guard\r\n\r\noutside  the  door.  They were overwhelmingly  outnumbered,  and\r\n\r\nunarmed.   Thirdly,  more than 400 people,  including  teachers,\r\n\r\ntimidly submitted to the six unknown invaders, and allowed  them\r\n\r\nto do whatever they wanted in the school auditorium.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first reaction was that of a great shock. How could the\r\n\r\n400  teachers  and  students, who clearly  outnumbered  the  six\r\n\r\nunarmed  members  of  the National Cadet  Corps   who  acted  as\r\n\r\nJapanese  soldiers,  allow themselves to be humiliated  in  this\r\n\r\nmanner?  Moreover, the teachers and students were not forewarned\r\n\r\nof such an exercise. Did they think that this was the real thing\r\n\r\nand were so\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nscared that they did not have the strength to defend themselves?\r\n\r\nOr is it because they decided to be worldly wise and played safe\r\n\r\nto  avoid  worse treatment?  Having thought about all  these,  I\r\n\r\njust could not help feeling dejected.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, I was not present at that time, and I do not\r\n\r\nknow  what  was in the minds of those who were present.   But  I\r\n\r\nfeel that this incident has indeed inspired us to think over and\r\n\r\nmake an in-depth study on what has become of our people and  our\r\n\r\nsociety in these 30 years of nation building.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that in the early years of our nation building,\r\n\r\nthe then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said that we should build a\r\n\r\nstaunch and vigorous society.  It is with this connotation  that\r\n\r\nwe selected the lion and the tiger to put in our State emblem.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, from the reaction of the teachers and students in the\r\n\r\nJin  Tai  Secondary School's exercise, I cannot help asking  how\r\n\r\nmuch  we  have achieved in our target of building a staunch  and\r\n\r\nvigorous  society.  Is it because under the strong authoritarian\r\n\r\ncontrol  of  our Government, our people have become  soft.   Our\r\n\r\npeople  have developed the kiasu mentality and the social  value\r\n\r\nof being afraid to get into trouble.  Since Singapore is just  a\r\n\r\nlittle  red  dot in the ocean of Southeast Asia,  what  kind  of\r\n\r\nimpact  will  this mentality have on our future and security  of\r\n\r\nour nation?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no answer to this question. Due to time\r\n\r\nconstraint,  I will not be able to go into details  on  how  the\r\n\r\nsocial  values  and  mentality of our people today  are  closely\r\n\r\nrelated  to the style of governance of the political leaders  in\r\n\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this incident has reminded me of a small article\r\n\r\nin  the  Lianhe  Zaobao which said that when the Government  was\r\n\r\nadjusting  its language policy, a reporter tried to interview  a\r\n\r\nstudent  but the student did not dare to be interviewed  because\r\n\r\nhis  school principal was attending a meeting and he  would  not\r\n\r\ncommit  himself.   He  insisted  that  without  the  principal's\r\n\r\napproval, he could not agree to the interview.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Jin Tai Secondary School's incident,\r\n\r\ncould  it also be because the principal was attending a meeting,\r\n\r\nand  the  teachers and students could not decide for themselves?\r\n\r\nThey  did  not know whether to put up a resistance or to  submit\r\n\r\ntimidly.    As  a result, they were humiliated for no  rhyme  or\r\n\r\nreason,  and  they  did not even dare to  make  any  noise.   My\r\n\r\ngoodness, all is lost!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our National Education, I think emphasis should be given\r\n\r\non  how  to  inculcate in our younger generation of Singaporeans\r\n\r\nthe spirit of resistance and defence.  They should be cultivated\r\n\r\nto  rise  up and resist any injustice and unreasonable treatment\r\n\r\nupon  them.   They should not be left at their  wits'  end  when\r\n\r\nconfronted by a sudden attack or invasion.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Peter Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peter Chen:</b> In view of the time, I shall try to be\r\n\r\nbrief.   Mr  Yeo  Guat Kwang raised the concern about  financial\r\n\r\nassistance  for needy students.  Yes, indeed, the  threshold  at\r\n\r\nwhich assistance is given does appear low, but one must bear  in\r\n\r\nmind  that  the  Ministry of Education  is  also  following  the\r\n\r\nguidelines  set by the Ministry of Community Development.   This\r\n\r\nis  something which one has to look at.  However, no student  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  who  wants to study in our school has been  denied  a\r\n\r\nplace  in  a school for want of financial assistance.  If  there\r\n\r\nare any cases, we will be very happy to look at them.  There are\r\n\r\nnumerous agencies and sources of funding.  This year alone,  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  expects to offer financial assistance to nearly  3,000\r\n\r\nstudents  totalling $340,000.  But this is in  addition  to  the\r\n\r\nhelp given by schools, community and charity organisations.  The\r\n\r\ninvolvement of the community is important. For example, in 1997,\r\n\r\nnearly 53,000 awards totalling more than $11 million were  given\r\n\r\nby CCCs and CDCs to our students.  More will also be done at the\r\n\r\nuniversities. The Government has decided to increase the cap  of\r\n\r\nthe  dollar for dollar matching for NTU's and NUS' student funds\r\n\r\nfrom  half  a million dollars to three-quarter million  dollars.\r\n\r\nMore bursaries and book grants for the needy undergraduates will\r\n\r\nnow be possible.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On National Education, Mr Low Thia Khiang has raised the\r\n\r\npoint that perhaps our students have become soft judging by  the\r\n\r\nrecent incidents at our school.   I agree with Mr Low.  Perhaps,\r\n\r\nin  many  ways,  we  are a victim of our own success.   We  have\r\n\r\nbecome prosperous and perhaps we have become somewhat soft  over\r\n\r\nthe  years.   It is because of that that we do want  to  promote\r\n\r\nresilience  among  our  students and we  can  only  do  this  by\r\n\r\nactually  bringing reality and imagination to National Education\r\n\r\nlessons.  I would also ask perhaps that Mr Low should not be too\r\n\r\nover critical and begin to finger-point scapegoats because we do\r\n\r\nnot   really  want  to  discourage  the  continuation  of  these\r\n\r\ninnovative and lively ways of bringing reality to our lessons.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay has earlier on very eloquently pleaded that\r\n\r\nthis  sort of activities should continue rather than be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe answer is not to stop it but to make sure that our processes\r\n\r\nare right and well thought through.  I would therefore thank  Mr\r\n\r\nLow for pointing this out.  Indeed, we do agree that perhaps our\r\n\r\nsuccess has made us somewhat soft and we would try to do more to\r\n\r\nmove in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I just wish to clarify that it was\r\n\r\nnot  my intention to pinpoint anyone as a scapegoat.

The objectives in legalising football betting  are  to\r\n\r\nprovide a source of funds to support the development of S-League\r\n\r\nand  local  football and to promote sports in general  and  help\r\n\r\nstamp  out  illegal football betting.   Based on the nature  and\r\n\r\nmarket for football betting, I have decided on a betting duty of\r\n\r\n20%  of gross profits on football betting.  The tax rate of  20%\r\n\r\nwas  decided taking into account the need of the legal  operator\r\n\r\nto  compete  with illegal operators as well as to give  adequate\r\n\r\nfunding  for  S-League which is in its development phase.   This\r\n\r\nrate would be reviewed after two years when the market for legal\r\n\r\nfootball betting is better established.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Proposed Amendments</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes the following amendments to the Betting and\r\n\r\nSweepstake Duties Act:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Introduction of a new section 2A relating to sports betting\r\n\r\nduty  to  put  into legislative effect of the 20% tax  on  gross\r\n\r\nprofits  on football betting as well as any other sports events,\r\n\r\nwhere the bets received or negotiated are at fixed odds;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Repeal of existing section 4 and substitution of a new\r\n\r\nsection  4.  Whilst the tax rate on other forms of betting  such\r\n\r\nas  horse racing, Toto, 4D and Singapore Sweep is based on gross\r\n\r\nbets,  the  tax  rate  on football betting  is  based  on  gross\r\n\r\nprofits.   Promoters of football betting are  thus  required  to\r\n\r\nsubmit additional particulars such as the winnings paid. The new\r\n\r\nsection 4 provides for this requirement;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Miscellaneous consequential amendments to sections 3 and 5\r\n\r\nupon the introduction of the sports betting duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  football  sweepstakes will be  introduced  here  soon.   A\r\n\r\nnumber  of reasons have been offered why this has to be provided\r\n\r\nfor.   Singapore Pools, which conducts the football sweepstakes,\r\n\r\nsays that the Singapore Football League (S-League) is a national\r\n\r\nproject which deserves to be supported.  There is also a need to\r\n\r\nincrease  the  funds of the football clubs involved  to  attract\r\n\r\nmore supporters and to eliminate illegal football betting.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the S-League football clubs are very supportive of\r\n\r\nthe  introduction of football betting, there are others who have\r\n\r\nexpressed their concern and even some who are against  the  idea\r\n\r\naltogether.   I do not deny and indeed believe that  betting  in\r\n\r\nany  form is a value that we should not encourage and should  be\r\n\r\ndeterred.  I also believe that, besides Islam, gambling is  also\r\n\r\nagainst   the   major  religions  in  this  country,   such   as\r\n\r\nChristianity, Sikhism,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nBuddhism and Taoism.  However, in regard to the Singapore  Pools\r\n\r\nS-League  football sweepstakes, I would like to see  this  in  a\r\n\r\nwider  perspective, in the context of a secular country.   There\r\n\r\nare  already various forms of betting such as Big Sweep, 4D  and\r\n\r\nToto,  as  mentioned by the Finance Minister just now.  Football\r\n\r\nbetting has also been around for some time, although it has been\r\n\r\ngoing   on  illegally.   I  also  believe  that  the  Government\r\n\r\ncertainly does not have the intention to encourage gambling with\r\n\r\nthe  introduction  of the S-League football  betting.   Besides,\r\n\r\nwith more effective control and supervision, I believe that  the\r\n\r\nintroduction  of  this  Bill will also strengthen  the  football\r\n\r\nfunds  so as to develop this game further to a higher level  and\r\n\r\nto  attain  our  vision to enter the finals  of  the  World  Cup\r\n\r\nfootball competition in 2010.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question now is, with the legalisation of the S-League\r\n\r\nfootball  betting, are we indirectly encouraging more people  to\r\n\r\ngamble?   Or  by not introducing this, will football betting  be\r\n\r\neliminated  altogether?   In  my view,  the  choice  depends  on\r\n\r\nourselves.   Just  like  other things, the  individual  has  the\r\n\r\nchoice.  With regard to this, whether to stay away from gambling\r\n\r\nor to be involved in it, it is up to us.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Muslims, we play the role of educating our children to\r\n\r\nstay  away  from  gambling, in whatever form altogether.   As  a\r\n\r\nMuslim  society  in a secular, multi-racial and  multi-religious\r\n\r\ncountry,  this  is  a  dilemma.  And this  requires  that  every\r\n\r\ncommunity seeks its own solution.  I believe that no matter what\r\n\r\nwe do, only an effective education can overcome it.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Sir, the Bill is timely, especially we\r\n\r\nall know that betting is quite prevalent in Singapore.  Football\r\n\r\nbetting is something that is not new.  Other countries have  it.\r\n\r\nAnd  I  think we should have no qualms about it.  But the  money\r\n\r\nwill be for a good cause.  The only concern I have is this.  Why\r\n\r\nhas  he decided to have 20%, instead of a lower figure?  I  know\r\n\r\nhe  could, by Government Gazette, prescribe another figure.  But\r\n\r\nI thought he could probably start with 15%.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\nmain  purpose  of  this Amendment Bill is to  legalise  football\r\n\r\nbetting.  The Government's decision to legalise football betting\r\n\r\nwill create a precedence in pegging sports with gambling.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would like to know what kind of signal or\r\n\r\nvalues  are we trying to send to our citizens by this  Amendment\r\n\r\nBill.   Is  the Government thinking that gambling  can  help  to\r\n\r\nrectify  the kiasu mentality of our Singaporeans? Do not  worry,\r\n\r\nlay your bets.  Give it a try, no venture, no gain!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government's reason is that if football betting is\r\n\r\nnot  legalised, people will still bet on football  anyway,  then\r\n\r\nthere  are now, in the market, various forms of illegal gambling\r\n\r\nin  Singapore, for example, the traditional chap ji kee, betting\r\n\r\non  billiards,  betting on bowling, and betting  in  high  class\r\n\r\ngames  such  as golf.  So, is the Government going  to  consider\r\n\r\nlegalising all these forms of gambling as well?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the greatest difference between illegal and legal\r\n\r\ngambling  is that the illegal operators do not dare  to  promote\r\n\r\ntheir  activities  openly and they do not receive  bets  openly.\r\n\r\nBut   the   legalised  operators  can  brazenly  promote   their\r\n\r\nactivities.   They  can even advertise in the newspapers,  which\r\n\r\nthey  do.  They are licensed to set up betting stations all over\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The extent of influence on our society is  certainly\r\n\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, why do we want to peg betting with sports? Does\r\n\r\nthe Government feel that only by pegging betting with sports can\r\n\r\nwe  make  Singaporeans  love  the  game  of  football?   If  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  believes that this is the only way  to  promote  the\r\n\r\ngame  of  football  in Singapore and to make  more  Singaporeans\r\n\r\nsupport the S-League Football started by the Government, then  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to know for those who are crazy over football,  are\r\n\r\nthey  crazy  over the game of football, or are they  crazy  over\r\n\r\ngambling?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fans or spectators who support a certain football team,\r\n\r\nare they supporting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  team  from the area where they live to express cohesiveness\r\n\r\nin the community, or simply because they are betting on the team\r\n\r\nwinning money for them?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially when the Government decided to let the Singapore\r\n\r\nnational  team drop from the Malaysian Cup football  league  and\r\n\r\nstarted its own Singapore S-League, was it already intending  to\r\n\r\nlegalise football betting?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am worried is that in future if a certain team loses\r\n\r\nand  causes  the  football  spectators to lose their  money  and\r\n\r\nhence their temper, will their feelings run so high  as to cause\r\n\r\na  riot like what had happened in the other countries, and  take\r\n\r\nit  out  on the footballers after the game?  This would be  very\r\n\r\nunfair to the footballers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government feels that public feeling in Singapore is\r\n\r\nsuch  that  we  can  only  go through  gambling  which  involves\r\n\r\npersonal interest to promote certain sports or events, then will\r\n\r\nthe  Government also consider amending the law to allow for  the\r\n\r\nbetting on inter-school basketball or volleyball tournaments  to\r\n\r\npromote   basketball  and  volleyball?   Later  on,   will   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  also  start a National Election Lottery  to  receive\r\n\r\nbets from the people on the results of the General Election  and\r\n\r\nthe Presidential Election?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that the only advantage of this\r\n\r\nAmendment Bill is that the Government would be able to collect a\r\n\r\nlot  of  tax money from this new form of  gambling and  lots  of\r\n\r\nmoney   will  go  into  the  coffer.   Perhaps,  this   is   the\r\n\r\nGovernment's  novel idea of opening a new source of  revenue  in\r\n\r\nview of the tax reduction due to the current economic crisis!\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all, I\r\n\r\nwould  like to thank Mr Ahmad Magad for his support of the Bill,\r\n\r\nnotwithstanding his reservations about the religious aspects  of\r\n\r\ngambling  which  everybody recognises.   It  is  an  undesirable\r\n\r\nactivity  but,  nevertheless,  not  one  which  we  can   easily\r\n\r\neliminate.   I think tolerance, understanding and education  are\r\n\r\nthe only\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nroutes  to  eventually  solve it.  The  parents  should  try  to\r\n\r\ndissuade  their  children  from  taking  up  gambling.   So  his\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the issue is very commendable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai asked why 20%, and not 15%. This was based on an\r\n\r\nestimate of the amount of revenue which will accrue to Singapore\r\n\r\nPools   for   use  in  promoting  football  and  other   sports.\r\n\r\nGovernment  will take its reasonable share, but we  will  review\r\n\r\nthis after two years, depending on the actual outcome.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the more general philosophy expressed by Mr Low,\r\n\r\nI  do  not  disagree with him that promoting gambling is  not  a\r\n\r\ndesirable  objective nor something which the  Government  should\r\n\r\nengage  in.   Unfortunately, we are dealing with  human  nature.\r\n\r\nPeople,  many of them, are inclined to take risks, and  gambling\r\n\r\nis  a  manifestation of risk-taking.  By and large, the majority\r\n\r\nof people engage in gambling as a form of recreation, small size\r\n\r\ngambling with $5 on a football match, a golf match, or a private\r\n\r\nbet on some other event, so that for us, as a Government, to say\r\n\r\nthat there should be no gambling altogether is unrealistic.   Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  it can be done.  But I doubt whether we could eliminate\r\n\r\nhuman  nature.  All you would do is in fact push it  underground\r\n\r\nand, eventually, the only people who will profit are the illegal\r\n\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked what is our objective in legalising football\r\n\r\nbetting.  Why not legalise all other forms of gambling, such  as\r\n\r\nchap  ji  kee  or some of the other minor gambling  forms?   The\r\n\r\nsimple  answer  is that we try to avoid as much  legislation  as\r\n\r\npossible until the activity reaches a level which requires  some\r\n\r\nform  of  regulation.  Football has reached a  stage  where  the\r\n\r\nactivity of illegal gambling in football which is happening now,\r\n\r\nis  quite large.  And we do not want to leave the field open  to\r\n\r\nillegal  gamblers who will use their revenues to promote bribery\r\n\r\nand match-fixing.  We must do all we can to eliminate this.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the primary objective, apart from the funds made\r\n\r\navailable for promoting S-League and other sports, is to try and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nregulate  this  and  try to knock out, if we  can,  the  illegal\r\n\r\noperators.  It may not be possible to reduce them entirely.  But\r\n\r\nby  and  large,  our  experience with  legalising  horse  racing\r\n\r\ngambling and 4-D has proven that this substantially reduces  the\r\n\r\nscope for illegal operators.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his suggestion that Government has introduced this Bill\r\n\r\nin  order  to  generate new sources of income, he could  not  be\r\n\r\nfurther  away  from the truth.  We have estimated that,  in  the\r\n\r\nfirst couple of years, the total volume of football betting will\r\n\r\nprobably  be around $250 million a year gross.  After  deduction\r\n\r\nof  bet payoffs and the operating cost, Singapore Pools will  be\r\n\r\nable to provide about $9 million per year of funding for the  S-League plus other sports activities, leaving the Government with\r\n\r\n$4  million a year of new tax revenue.  He will understand  that\r\n\r\nthis is a very small sum and, obviously, it is not a new revenue\r\n\r\nsource of any consequence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, based on the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance's  answer, it seems to me that if any form  of  gambling\r\n\r\nhas  reached  a  level of popularity, the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nmight consider legalising it.  Chap ji kee is a traditional form\r\n\r\nof  gambling in Singapore with a long history and many old folks\r\n\r\nlike it.  If the popularity of chap ji kee increases, would  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance consider legalising it?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I think we will have to wait to see\r\n\r\nwhat  is the size of it.

A large surface  area  is\r\n\r\nrequired  for  the installation of solar panels. In  land-scarce\r\n\r\nSingapore,  it  would not be practical to harness  solar  energy\r\n\r\nthis way. The capital cost of solar panels is also high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Government has not funded any private-sector\r\n\r\nprojects on solar energy research.  MINDEF, in a pilot trial for\r\n\r\nsolar-powered lights, is using solar energy for streetlights  in\r\n\r\na  Kranji  military facility. Its pilot solar power  project  at\r\n\r\nTuas  Naval Base has shown the potential of incorporating  solar\r\n\r\npanels into the design of a building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Science and Technology Board (NSTB) has funded\r\n\r\nprojects which aim to develop systems and devices for optimising\r\n\r\nthe  use  of  energy,  for example, in \"intelligent\"  buildings.\r\n\r\nPrivate sector companies which are keen to undertake research on\r\n\r\nrenewable  energy sources, including solar energy research,  can\r\n\r\napply to the NSTB for R&D funding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government continues to encourage the use of energy-saving equipment. The Ministry of the Environment administers\r\n\r\nthe   accelerated  depreciation  allowance  scheme  for  energy-efficient  and  energy-saving equipment and  technology.   Under\r\n\r\nthis  scheme, solar heating or cooling systems, and solar energy\r\n\r\ncollection systems can qualify to be expensed off in one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LIQUID PETROLEUM GAS POWERED VEHICLES</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Toh See Kiat</b> asked the Minister for Communications if\r\n\r\nSingapore will allow the introduction and encourage the  use  of\r\n\r\nLiquid  Petroleum  Gas powered motor vehicles  in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nenvironmental and economic advantages of such vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority does not object to the\r\n\r\nintroduction and use of LPG vehicles in Singapore if  they  meet\r\n\r\ninternationally recognised safety standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Home  Affairs have certain requirements regarding  the  bulk\r\n\r\nhandling and storage of LPG which may impact the feasibility  of\r\n\r\nusing LPG vehicles. For instance, though Liquefied Petroleum Gas\r\n\r\nor  LPG  vehicles might be emitting lower levels of particulates\r\n\r\nand  other  pollutants than diesel-driven  vehicles,  LPG  is  a\r\n\r\nhighly  flammable  substance - more so than petrol  and  diesel.\r\n\r\nWith Singapore as a densely populated society and where many  of\r\n\r\nthe  petrol  stations are co-located with housing  estates,  the\r\n\r\nbulk  transportation and storage of LPG in petrol  stations  are\r\n\r\npotential fire hazards. These safety standards would have to  be\r\n\r\nproperly addressed if LPG vehicles were to be used in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>MOSQUE IN HONG KAH GRC</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Harun A Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Harun A Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Community\r\n\r\nDevelopment  and  Minister in charge of Muslim  Affairs  when  a\r\n\r\nmosque  will be built at Hong Kah GRC (Nanyang, Jurong West  and\r\n\r\nEast).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already a mosque (Masjid Al Mukminin) in Jurong\r\n\r\nEast  and  another mosque (Masjid Assyakirin)  in  Jurong  West.\r\n\r\nUnder  the  Mosque  Building Fund (MBF) programme,  the  current\r\n\r\npolicy  is  to  build  one  mosque in each  area  covered  by  a\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Guide Plan (DGP).
