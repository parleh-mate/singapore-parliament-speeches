<B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the criminal case against CPL Dave Teo is pending.&nbsp; Investigations by the Police are<p align=left>Column: 1475<p> ongoing.&nbsp; My answer must therefore be circumspect so as not to prejudice the ongoing case and police investigations.&nbsp; My answer will therefore focus on the SAF's control of arms and ammunition and be based primarily on preliminary findings by the SAF and MINDEF only.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the SAF's mission is to defend Singapore and in order to do so, it has to train and carry out duties, both in peacetime and in times of conflict and emergencies, and SAF soldiers have to be issued with weapons and ammunition.&nbsp; MINDEF and the SAF are very mindful that the misuse of firearms can lead to very serious consequences.&nbsp; Hence, there are stringent systems and procedures to ensure that arms and ammunition are strictly controlled, and that if there are any lapses in the control of arms and ammunition in the SAF, these are promptly and properly dealt with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the incident involving CPL Teo, the SAF immediately convened a Higher Board of Inquiry (HBOI) to determine how this could have taken place and to review whether our current systems and procedures are adequate to prevent a similar incident from occurring.&nbsp; Separately, we also audited and reviewed the security of all SAF camps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HBOI reviewed current systems and procedures for the screening of personnel for suitability to bear arms, the issuance and use of arms and ammunition, the conduct of guard room duties, camp security, and post-incident reporting.&nbsp; The review concluded that these systems are sound.&nbsp; Together, they allow SAF soldiers to carry out their duties and training, while deterring and detecting those who may seek to steal or make improper use of arms and ammunition, making it very difficult for anyone to do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lam Pin Min asked about current measures to control the issuance and use<p align=left>Column: 1476<p> of firearms in military service and whether there will be additional measures to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Let me describe the current procedures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF has very detailed procedures to control the issuance and use of arms and ammunition.&nbsp; Arms and ammunition are separately controlled and strictly accounted for on an individual basis.&nbsp; In all camps, firearms are kept in an armoury while ammunition is stored separately in ammunition dumps.&nbsp; In peacetime, live ammunition is only issued for live firing, guard duties and specific operational needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Live ammunition and firearms are also kept separate in these activities until the point of use.&nbsp; In all cases, the issue and return of firearms and ammunition are carried out formally with clear procedures by designated persons, at designated locations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Guard Rooms, firearms are to be kept chained on a rack when not in use, while ammunition is to be placed in a secured storage container.&nbsp; Servicemen assigned Guard Duties are only issued firearms and ammunition just before the start of their shift.&nbsp; These items are to be returned promptly at the end of the duty personnel's shift to the Guard Commander, who has to account for the quantity, serial number and the condition of the arms and ammunition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the control and management of ammunition during training and live firing exercises, a serviceman who is at least a Platoon Sergeant is tasked specifically to account for the issuance and return of ammunition.&nbsp; Each serviceman registers for the issue and return of his own ammunition.&nbsp; In ranges and live firing exercises, servicemen are only issued ammunition just prior to the commencement of their firing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after training activities, any remaining ammunition is recovered<p align=left>Column: 1477<p> and counted and returned to the ammunition depot.&nbsp; Spent or empty cartridges are also recovered. Servicemen are also required to check if they have inadvertently failed to return any ammunition before they make a declaration that they do not have any live rounds or empty cartridges in their possession.&nbsp; They are then required to empty out their personal equipment for inspection by their commanders.&nbsp; Accounting for rounds must be completed before training is considered to have ended.&nbsp; In addition, in case any serviceman has evaded these checks and secreted any rounds after the firing exercises, commanders also conduct spot checks during barrack inspections and when servicemen leave camp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a system in place, the risk of theft, loss or unauthorised possession of any weapon or live round is very limited.&nbsp; Every serviceman knows that the unauthorised possession of any weapon or live round will result in disciplinary proceedings and very serious punishment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SAF also screens personnel for suitability to carry firearms.&nbsp; Prior to enlistment, pre-enlistees are assessed for suitability for National Service (NS).&nbsp; Pre-enlistees with a history of psychiatric disorder or those who have been convicted of serious offences are considered for non-enlistment for NS, depending on the severity of their condition or the severity of the offence they have committed.&nbsp; Those who are enlisted may be disallowed from bearing arms, or are not assigned to vocations where sensitive training or skills are involved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After enlistment, measures are in place to ensure that servicemen deployed to various vocations are fit to discharge their duties.&nbsp; Commanders routinely interview<p align=left>Column: 1478<p> their servicemen so that those with disciplinary or psychological problems and those in need of assistance can be identified for follow up by competent authorities.&nbsp; A serviceman who is assessed to be a security risk either because of his disciplinary history or mental state may be temporarily excused from duties which require him to bear arms and, after proper medical or security evaluation, re-deployed to another vocation where he does not do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to the HBOI's findings on the case in question.&nbsp;&nbsp; CPL Dave Teo Ming, a 20-year-old full-time National Serviceman, was serving as an Infantryman in the 1st Battalion, Singapore Infantry Regiment, or 1 SIR.&nbsp; Prior to enlistment, CPL Teo was assessed to be suitable for service as an infantryman.&nbsp;&nbsp; CPL Teo's service record during full-time NS, from his enlistment&nbsp; till 2nd September 2007, did not indicate behaviour that warranted disqualification from bearing firearms.&nbsp; CPL Teo was observed to have performed well during his unit's overseas proficiency evaluation exercise in April this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPL Teo was interviewed by his Platoon Commander in June this year, who noted that he was stressed over relationship problems with his girlfriend.&nbsp; However, in the two interviews following that, the last being in August, he did not raise the issue of his failed relationship again.&nbsp; During the two weeks prior to the incident on 2nd September, neither his Platoon Commander nor his bunk mate noticed any unusual behaviour by CPL Teo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPL Teo was on Guard Duty and assigned patrol duties at Mandai Hill Camp on the night of 2nd September 2007.&nbsp; In line with procedures, he was properly issued his personal firearm, a SAR 21 rifle, and&nbsp;five rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition at the start of his shift at<p align=left>Column: 1479<p> 2000 hours.&nbsp; His Guard Commander realised that he was absent from his place of duty at 2359 hours, when he did not return his firearm and ammunition at the end of his shift.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A search was immediately initiated for the missing serviceman as well as for his firearm and ammunition. When preliminary investigations by the Military Police indicated that the missing firearm and ammunition were no longer on the camp premises, the Singapore Police were contacted at 0545 hours.&nbsp; The SAF worked closely with the Police and at about 2000 hours on 3rd September 2007, CPL Teo was apprehended at Orchard Cineleisure.&nbsp; I must commend the Police on a job well done in apprehending CPL Teo and in recovering his weapon and the ammunition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When CPL Teo was arrested, his firearm and&nbsp;eight rounds of ammunition were recovered.&nbsp; All&nbsp;five rounds of 5.56 mm ammunition which were issued to him for guard duty on 2nd September were recovered.&nbsp; Investigations have traced the additional three 5.56 mm tracer rounds to a batch of ammunition that was used during a section live firing exercise that CPL Teo participated in two weeks earlier, in August 2007.&nbsp; The Police and the SAF are still investigating exactly how he acquired these three tracer rounds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the HBOI concluded that although the SAF's systems and procedures are generally adequate, this incident involved three lapses specific to this situation.&nbsp; Firstly, there were weaknesses in the implementation and supervision of Guard Room procedures at Mandai Hill Camp that night.&nbsp; Secondly, weaknesses in the physical construction of Mandai Hill Camp also enabled CPL Teo to slip out without being detected.&nbsp; Thirdly, in terms of post-incident management, there was non-compliance with reporting procedures which require the quick reporting of all<p align=left>Column: 1480<p> serious incidents, such as those involving missing arms and ammunition.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are clear procedures, laid out in detail, for all activities under the purview of the Guard Room.&nbsp; Guard duties involve sentry and patrolling duties. CPL Teo was assigned patrolling duties on the night of the incident.&nbsp; Procedures require patrolling duties to be conducted on two-hour shifts and in pairs, to ensure mutual support and responsibility while on duty.&nbsp; Guards on patrol duties are also required to make situational reports to the Guard Room at half-hourly intervals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These procedures were not carried out properly on the night that CPL Teo was on duty.&nbsp; If they had been properly enforced, it would have been extremely difficult for him to have left the camp undetected, and even if he had managed to slip out, his absence would probably have been detected and reported earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this incident, the SAF has audited and reviewed the camp guard security of all SAF camps to determine whether such non-compliance of orders and procedures exists in other camps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The audit found that SAF camps comply with the relevant orders and procedures, and that this is a problem localised to this unit.&nbsp; Nonetheless, all SAF units have reiterated the importance of adhering to orders and procedures, and the SAF has stepped up the frequency of security audits of all SAF camps to ensure compliance with stipulated camp guard procedures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigations based on video footage from the security cameras show that CPL Teo did not leave camp by the Camp gates.&nbsp; Investigations have shown that CPL Teo absconded by jumping off the far corner of the second floor parapet of the Guard Room onto the car park outside the Camp premises, out of the visual scope of the other Guards.&nbsp; Before doing so, he <p align=left>Column: 1481<p>had dismantled his rifle and concealed it in his field pack.&nbsp; That he managed to do so, revealed a weakness in the physical security of the camp - which was designed to prevent unauthorised entry, rather than unauthorised exit&nbsp;- a weakness which has since been rectified at Mandai Hill Camp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this incident, we have done a thorough audit of the physical security of all SAF camps and guard rooms.&nbsp; Most of them fully meet the physical security requirements.&nbsp; A few require some improvements.&nbsp; We are in the process of implementing these improvements and have tightened our camp physical security standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For serious security incidents such as those involving missing arms and ammunition, the unit's Duty Operations Officer is required to report the incident to the Army's General Staff Operations Centre, within 30 minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, CPL Teo, together with his firearm and ammunition, was discovered missing by the Guard Commander at 2359 hours on 2nd September, but the Army's General Staff Operations Centre was only informed of the incident at 0300 hours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister two supplementary questions. The Minister has indicated that there were three breaches, as it were, one of which was delay in post-incident reporting.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp;what was the reason why there was a delay? And the wider question is:&nbsp; is there a&nbsp;general mindset that where something goes wrong, there is that instinctive urge to hold back the reporting until, hopefully, they can do something to rectify it?&nbsp;&nbsp;If that is the case, it is something that has an impact on the SAF at large and is something that would need to be tightened up.&nbsp; That is the first question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second supplementary question is this:&nbsp;&nbsp;the Minister mentioned that all the ammunition was accounted for.&nbsp; In the case of CPL Dave Teo, he was found with five rounds and three rounds. The five rounds were the ones that he had when he was on guard duty. For that, the Minister has explained.&nbsp; But the three<p align=left>Column: 1483<p> tracer rounds came from two weeks previously which would indicate that the camp was not aware that those rounds were missing.&nbsp; My question is&nbsp;how that was overlooked and whether that is something that has since been tightened up as well.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the requirement to report immediately to the Army's General Staff Operations Centre is stated in the procedures and the camp should do so once it has realised that an incident that requires reporting has taken place.&nbsp; Of course,&nbsp;that requires an assessment of the person on the ground.&nbsp; I would not want to speculate specifically on this case but,&nbsp;in general, if you say that you find a person who is missing, it could be that the person has fallen ill or something has happened to him and, therefore, you initiate a search for him in the first place, rather than presume that he has run away.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are possible things which, on the ground, the individual Commanders have to make an assessment and whether or not they should make a report of each of these things immediately.&nbsp; My own assessment is that, in this case, because it did involve arms and ammunition, the Commanders should have reported earlier, and as soon as they felt that there might have been some chance of&nbsp;him having gone out of the camp.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of ammunition, I have described the procedures in place for accounting of ammunition during live firing.&nbsp;&nbsp;These procedures are very strict and very strictly adhered to.&nbsp; But I cannot say that it is impossible for a determined person to secrete one or two rounds of ammunition but it will&nbsp;be very difficult for him to do so.&nbsp; He will be taking a very high risk and also it will be very difficult for him to take a large quantity of ammunition with him. There are very clear procedures in place. I think every serviceman who has been to the ranges&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1484<p>for live firings will know these procedures are very strictly followed and that physical searches are also conducted, so that it is very difficult to do so and the chances of any of these things happening&nbsp;are very low. The investigations in this particular case are still continuing and I would not want to make any presumption on how that might have happened.&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNITED STATES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS--><p align=left>Column: 1484<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNITED STATES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS:::1487--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>UNITED STATES SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS</span></B></div><BR>\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Impact on Singapore's economy--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Impact on Singapore's economy)</span></B></div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B> asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) to what extent, if any, will the lingering United States sub-prime mortgage crisis negatively impact Singapore's economy; and (b) what are the short and long term measures in place to ensure that Singapore will not be negatively impacted.<br></p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, Dr Neo has asked to&nbsp;what extent, if any, will the lingering United States sub-prime mortgage crisis could have a negative impact on Singapore's economy and whether there are&nbsp;measures to mitigate such impact, if any.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is still too early to assess with a high degree of confidence how the sub-prime mortgage problem in the US housing market will affect the credit and other financial markets, and whether this will eventually spill over to the real economy in the US and Europe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are growing concerns that uncertainty in financial markets will lead to a loss of confidence and result in a more general credit squeeze.&nbsp; This will, if it occurs,&nbsp;in turn hurt investment and consumption in the US and Europe.&nbsp; If growth slows in these major economies, Singapore will be affected.&nbsp; Strong<p align=left>Column: 1485<p> growth in the region and the diversity of our export markets will provide us some buffer, but we are not immune to a slowdown in the major industrial economies.&nbsp; At this stage, although the risks have increased, it is not clear that there has been a significant spill over into the real economy.&nbsp; Barring the unforeseen, MTI's growth forecast of 7%-8% for this year remains unchanged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a longer-term perspective, the current shakeout in the sub-prime market, if well managed and contained, can yield some positive outcomes.&nbsp; If it results in more realistic risk assessments and stronger credit standards, it will make for healthier markets and more sustained growth. The governments and central banks are working together to minimise the fallout and help bring about a smoother adjustment in credit markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restoring confidence to financial markets is key.&nbsp; Like central banks around the world, MAS has been closely monitoring the situation and stands ready to inject additional liquidity, if necessary.&nbsp; To date, our markets have been functioning in an orderly fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is also closely monitoring our financial institutions' exposure to sub-prime and other structured credit markets, at both the domestic and global levels.&nbsp; Our exposure remains small and contained at this stage.&nbsp; At the systemic level, the potential impact on Singapore's banking system is being monitored in consultation with the industry and subject to routine stress-testing exercises.&nbsp; MAS is also working with SGX to monitor its members, and to ensure that its clearing funds have sufficient resources to meet outstanding obligations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, may I ask the MOS to what extent is the<p align=left>Column: 1486<p> contingent of the sub-prime crisis a result of mismanaged fears and panics?&nbsp; What proportion are these concerns to the actual magnitude of the real problem?&nbsp; And, lastly, how does MOS respond to the market talk that the worst is yet to come?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Iswaran--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Iswaran</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Neo has asked what is the magnitude of the problem.&nbsp; I think that, in itself, is a matter of much research and speculation in the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;The point to register&nbsp;is really&nbsp;that if, in fact, the sub-prime mortgage problem is not well managed, then it can impact us in two ways.&nbsp; One is confidence in financial markets and that will have its own repercussions to the financial system to which we will be exposed. And the second is through its impact on the real economy, through credit squeeze and other effects.&nbsp; Both of these can have significant impact on us, although we are mitigated to some extent through the diversification of our economy.&nbsp; Quantifying the impact is quite a difficult task.

Our local financial institutions do not offer mortgages to sub-prime customers anywhere.&nbsp; They do, however, have investments in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) that contain some US sub-prime mortgages.&nbsp; CDOs are essentially debt instruments that are backed by financial assets, which could include loans and bonds sourced from various jurisdictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local banks have publicly disclosed that their total investment in CDOs amounts to S$2.3 billion, of which 28% contain some US sub-prime mortgages.&nbsp; I do not mean that 28% of that total figure is US sub-prime mortgages but 28% of their exposure comprises CDOs which contain some US sub-prime mortgages.&nbsp; The local banks' exposure to US sub-prime mortgages is therefore small in relation to their capital base. Even if we<p align=left>Column: 1488<p> take the total value of these CDOs that&nbsp;they have exposure to, which contain some US sub-prime mortgages, the amount would be about 1% of the banks' capital base. However, the affected CDOs are in fact well rated as they comprise mainly investment grade assets, not sub-prime assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the local banks, DBS Bank, has also stated that it has a contingent line of liquidity support to a legal vehicle holding CDOs and that this facility has since been drawn upon. It has also stated that the vehicle does not have underlying assets comprising US sub-prime mortgages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the CDO portfolios of our local asset management companies contain some US sub-prime mortgages, these are managed on behalf of their clients, who are mainly institutional investors.&nbsp; The investment risks are borne solely by the latter, with no legal recourse to the companies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of our local insurance companies have also invested in CDOs, but the amounts account for a very small proportion of their total assets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The local financial institutions are continuing to monitor the situation and keep the MAS posted of their exposures.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Lily Neo</B>:&nbsp; I have three supplementary questions.

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam</B> :&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on the first question which concerns the circumstances under which the MAS would want to intervene to provide additional liquidity to the market, MAS would only need to do so if there is a systemic crunch, in other words, systemic shortage of liquidity in the markets, such that normal lending and borrowing, between banks especially, is not taking place.&nbsp; This has not been the case so far.&nbsp; In fact, so far, MAS has not had to do anything extraordinary beyond its normal money market operations.&nbsp; The Singapore market has not suffered from a shortage of liquidity.&nbsp; There was a very temporary blip, I believe, on 10th August 2007, which was the day after the European Central Bank had made a very substantial injection of liquidity in the European markets&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;very temporary blip in local inter-bank interest rates, which subsequently reversed itself&nbsp;and we are back to pre-crisis levels.&nbsp; The Singapore Inter-Bank Offer Rate (SIBOR), which is a good indicator of liquidity in the market, is back to the level it was before&nbsp;10th August - about 2.5%.&nbsp; That is a good indication that the market has been stable, liquidity has been ample and MAS has not had to intervene to do anything extraordinary.&nbsp; Of course, MAS stands ready should the situation arise to inject liquidity in the market to prevent systemic shortage of funds.&nbsp; That has always been the case, and&nbsp;remains the case going forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her second question on transparency, first, let me say that the local banks, DBS included, did make prompt disclosure of their exposure to US sub-prime mortgages.&nbsp; They were asked and they responded very promptly, including DBS.&nbsp; DBS subsequently made a further disclosure of its exposure to collateralised debt obligations which did not contain sub-prime mortgages.&nbsp; That was not asked of them in the first instance, but they made the disclosure a few days later so as to provide a complete picture.&nbsp; And<p align=left>Column: 1490<p> as I have explained earlier, the exposure to CDOs in general was not one that affected perceptions of their exposure to the US sub-prime problem.&nbsp; We are satisfied that they made prompt disclosures.&nbsp; The market too, if&nbsp;we look at what the analysts said, if&nbsp;we look at Fitch, for instance, which is the major institution that has market analyses and ratings of bonds, it has commended the Singapore banks for their thorough disclosure of their exposure to the US sub-prime mortgage problem.&nbsp; There is no convention on this internationally, and indeed many banks internationally have yet to fully disclose their exposure both to US sub-prime as well as to CDOs in general.&nbsp; Our banks have done so.&nbsp; They did so promptly and the market has assessed that their financial position is sound arising from the full disclosure of their exposure.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:UNITED STATES SUB-PRIME CRISIS--><p align=left>Column: 1490<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:UNITED STATES SUB-PRIME CRISIS:::1491--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Besides this transitional office site at Scotts Road, SLA has also made available a number of vacant State properties which can be quickly retrofitted and&nbsp;put to use as office.&nbsp; To date, SLA has made available 17 properties with a total&nbsp;gross floor area of 102,000 square metres&nbsp;for office use.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It recently awarded the tender for&nbsp;nine of these properties, with gross floor areas ranging from 700 square metres&nbsp;to about 20,000 square metres, and&nbsp; together can generate a total supply of about 54,000 square metres&nbsp;of office space.&nbsp; These properties include the former CPIB Building at Cantonment Road, the former CID Training Centre at Pearl's Hill Terrace, the former ITE premises at Pasir Panjang&nbsp;and the former Gan Eng Seng School and River Valley Primary School.&nbsp; The tenancy for these properties generally is for three years and will be renewable on terms of between&nbsp;three and&nbsp;six years.&nbsp; SLA is currently in the process of evaluating the tenders for several other properties for office use.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Member asked about the rentals.&nbsp; The&nbsp;rentals for the transitional office space and vacant State properties will depend very much on the business plans of the successful tenderers and, of course, also&nbsp;on the prevailing market conditions.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean:</B> Sir, Mdm Halimah, Mr Christopher de Souza and Mrs Josephine Teo&nbsp;have asked questions relating to re-employment of employees in the civil service reaching&nbsp;62 years and above and recruitment of employees aged above 40 and 50 years into the civil service over the last three years.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public sector has taken several steps to facilitate re-employment of retired employees, including amending its re-employment policy in September last year.&nbsp; Agencies are encouraged to offer re-employment to retiring officers, particularly those who have performed well and who can continue to add value to the organisation.&nbsp; Procedures were changed such that agencies need no longer conduct an open recruitment exercise if it re-employs its retired officer within six months from his retirement.&nbsp; The Public Sector also aligned its guidelines on the remuneration package for re-employed officers with the \"Tripartite Guidelines on the Employment of Older Workers Above 62 Years Old\".&nbsp; Re-employed officers are paid based on the scope of work and responsibility that they are given when they are re-employed.&nbsp; Re-employed officers need not be limited to doing their previous jobs at their previous pay.&nbsp; Those who are given a smaller job scope and responsibility will be paid a salary that is commensurate with the size of the new job.&nbsp; Re-employed officers can be employed on various flexible work arrangements, including on a part-time, or on a project basis.&nbsp; One example is the Ministry of Education's Adjunct Teaching scheme which has 1,100 adjunct teachers aged 62 years and above.&nbsp; They are engaged on either a short-term commitment of&nbsp;four to 10 weeks or a longer-term commitment of&nbsp;one to&nbsp;two years.&nbsp; Adjunct teachers are given the flexibility to do purely teaching, purely CCA or a mix of both.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The civil service has also started an older worker database, the Evergreen<p align=left>Column: 1495<p> Connect, in January this year where retiring and retired civil servants can sign up to be on the programme if they wish to be considered for job assignments in the public sector after their retirement.&nbsp; Of the 1,825 officers who were invited, about one-third have signed up for the programme.&nbsp; We have had a very modest start.&nbsp; To date, we have successfully made 14 placements in the civil service. This programme will eventually be extended to include statutory board employees.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Service Division works closely with Government agencies and the public sector unions to educate HR personnel, line supervisors and managers in the public sector to explore ways in which they can enhance employment and employability of older workers in their organisations.&nbsp; PSD and the unions have so far conducted three workshops to-date covering 33 Government agencies and will continue to run more of such workshops with the remaining public sector agencies.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public sector targets to put in place service-wide re-employment schemes and policies within the next three years.&nbsp; We aim to be ready well before re-employment legislation is implemented in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work is in progress and details will be released when we are ready.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average number of civil servants recruited in the 40's age band in the last three years is 270 while the average number for those in the age band above 50 years old is 207.&nbsp;&nbsp; This represents about 6% and 4% of the annual recruitment respectively.&nbsp; This means that about 10% of new hires in the civil service last year were aged above 40 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The average number of civil servants who retired annually at age 62 years from 2004 to 2006 is 200.&nbsp; The re-employment rate at age 62 years for the civil service is 22% for 2004, 25% for 2005 and 53% for 2006.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1496<p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the statutory boards as a whole, on average about 410 officers retired annually at age 62 years from 2004 to 2006.&nbsp; The re-employment rate is 83% for 2004, 70% for 2005 and 96% for 2006.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have equivalent re-employment data from the private sector for comparison with the public sector.&nbsp; Data from the Ministry of Manpower's Labour Force Survey show that the national resident employment rate for workers in the age range of 60 to 64 for the period 2004 to 2006 moved up from 34% in 2004 to 42% in 2006.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Halimah Yacob asked about the impact of the headcount freeze and best-sourcing policies on re-employment.&nbsp; Let me explain the objectives of these two policies. The manpower management framework was introduced in 2004 to instil discipline in the use of manpower resources in the public sector.&nbsp; The objective of the best-sourcing policy, introduced in 2003, is to market test whether non-strategic functions can be better done by the private sector and achieve greater value for money for the taxpayer's dollar.&nbsp; Both these policies are not aimed at any particular age group of civil servants.&nbsp; Rather, they are to help Government be disciplined in the way resources are utilised.&nbsp; The statistics, in fact, show that there has been an increase in re-employment of retired officers, particularly in 2006.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

<B>Mrs Josephine Teo (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> &nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Minister for his response to our questions.&nbsp; I am very glad to note the encouraging improvement in the re-employment figures for retiring employees of the civil service and the statutory boards.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if the civil service will consider placing a target on the number of civil servants who will be offered re-employment ahead of the 2012 legislation, since&nbsp;the Minister has already mentioned<p align=left>Column: 1497<p> that the civil service plans to introduce such measures well ahead of the legislative schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister another supplementary question in relation to the recruitment of mature Singaporeans.&nbsp; He mentioned that the figure was 6% in the civil service and, I think, if I heard him correctly, 4% in the statutory boards.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;6-plus-4 percent in total.&nbsp; It still seems like a figure that could be improved upon.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister if specific measures will be put in place to support the recruitment&nbsp;of mature Singaporeans as well into the civil service.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I said, we are currently studying the matter to see how we can move towards compliance with the new re-employment regulations when they come into place in 2012.&nbsp; So, I would not want to commit myself to setting a target for this.&nbsp; But, certainly, by 2012, we will be fully in compliance with the new re-employment regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the employment of new civil servants in the 40's age band and 50's age band, we must not forget that we also have civil servants who are in their 30s and 40s who grow older every year and become 40s and 50s.&nbsp; So, it is not as though we only have 6% in the 40's age band and 4% in the 50's age band, amounting to only 10% of our civil servants.&nbsp; But, in fact, we do have other civil servants who have not just recently been recruited who are in their 40s and 50s.&nbsp; So, we do have a good population of civil servants who are in their 40's and 50's age band in employment, though not necessarily recently recruited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I think the Member will also realise that whether or not the civil service is <p align=left>Column: 1498<p>able to recruit such people and actually get them to come in depends on the economic situation, the market situation and what other opportunities are available to these people in the 40's and 50's age band as well.&nbsp; So, it is not something which the civil service itself can decide upon, but it is also dependent on&nbsp; market conditions as well as the inclinations of those individuals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Or is it the policy in the public sector for the individual who is reaching the age of 62 to approach his supervisor to ask for re-employment?&nbsp; That is my first question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister said that agencies are encouraged to offer re-employment.&nbsp; My question is&nbsp;this: the feedback we receive is that across the Ministries and statutory boards, the efforts seem to be not very consistent.&nbsp; Is there a mechanism within the Public Service Division to coordinate the efforts of the Ministries and statutory boards on re-employment of those above 62?</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Teo Chee Hean</B>:&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree with Mdm Halimah that the practice across the Ministries and the agencies is not consistent.&nbsp; It is not uniform.&nbsp; There are some agencies and Ministries which are more active and provide more opportunities.&nbsp; The National Environment Agency, for example, is re-employing many of its employees who have reached the age of 62 and keeping them in employment not only for social reasons but because they feel that they need these employees, and these employees can continue to contribute in an effective way to NEA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1499<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would be happy to have the PSD work together with Mdm Halimah and the unions to see how we can improve this process.&nbsp; But I think it is also a two-way process.&nbsp; Because we also want our employees to actively make themselves more employable and to also perform well and not just sit back in the expectation that at the age of 62,&nbsp;they must be offered re-employment, then there is really not a lot of motivation on their own part to make themselves employable and to perform well.&nbsp; So, it requires a matching from both ends as well.&nbsp; We will be happy to work with Mdm Halimah and the unions.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B>&nbsp; The Minister mentioned that there were percentages of 22%, 25% and 23% for 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively, in terms of re-employment for those attaining the age of 62, and percentages which were more favourable for the statutory boards.&nbsp; My question is, of these civil servants, how many were re-employed in jobs commensurate to their skills and experience?&nbsp; Also, how many were re-employed on a full-time basis as opposed to a part-time basis?&nbsp; Because I think there must be the appreciation of the point that it could be that they are re-employed on terms that are not favourable to them.&nbsp; For example, they may take a 10%, 20%, or more than 50% reduction on the number of hours they used to work, and in the skill set that they are not&nbsp;entirely comfortable with.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Teo Chee Hean--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But, again, I must stress that there has to be a balance between what the employee would like and what the employer is able to offer.&nbsp; The employee's <p align=left>Column: 1500<p>assessment of his own performance may not be the same as the employer's assessment of his performance and his capability.&nbsp; It is also possible that the employee himself may want a change of pace at the age of 65.&nbsp; In the Ministry of Education, for example, you may have a person who has been a head of department in a school and he is offered re-employment as a teacher rather than as a head of department.&nbsp; Some employees on retirement would be delighted with that prospect but others might be disappointed.&nbsp; So, it does depend also on the mindset and the orientation and&nbsp;inclination of the employee.&nbsp; I think the purpose is to try and get as close a matching as possible, but we may not be able to get a 100% matching in expectations.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:JOB MATCHING SERVICES BY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS--><p align=left>Column: 1500<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:JOB MATCHING SERVICES BY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCILS:::1503--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Manpower (Mr Hawazi Daipi) (for the Minister for Manpower):&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> Sir, the success rates and time taken to place a job seeker depend on many factors. For example, during the last economic downturn, many more sought help from the CDCs, including many skilled workers, but placement rates would have been low as less opportunities existed. Conversely, in a tight labour market, where jobs go after applicants, fewer persons approach <p align=left>Column: 1501<p>the CDCs. But proportionately more low-skilled workers approach the CDCs for help after failed attempts on their own. It would be harder to place these workers who face structural unemployment and more time and effort to upgrade their skills and provide job coaching is required. Therefore, comparing results across periods or different CDCs or other Distributed&nbsp;Careerlink Network (DCN) partners would be less meaningful and need to be interpreted against the&nbsp;profile of applicants and economic conditions which can differ considerably. The DCN under WDA, of which the CDCs are part of, placed more than 22,000 job seekers in 2006, 60% of whom were aged 40 and above, and less than 20% had educational qualifications of 'O' levels and above.&nbsp; It is encouraging that 60% continue to stay in the job three months after placement.&nbsp; The CDCs typically place close to 30% of the job seekers who approach the CDCs.&nbsp; This placement rate is similar across the five CDCs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDA works with all the CDCs to constantly review and improve their processes and methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of the job centres.&nbsp; Besides sharing best practices among the CDCs and all other DCN job centres island-wide, WDA also organises regular training and case sharing sessions for the CDC and DCN staff.&nbsp; WDA also provides IT support to help CDCs better manage the information of job seekers, update their national database for job vacancies and organise the schedules of the Career Consultants so that they have more time to attend to the needs of each job seeker.&nbsp; Also, WDA has a system which tracks the placement and retention rates across the CDCs.&nbsp; This information can be used by the CDCs to monitor their performance.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Er Lee Bee Wah (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The needs of all the job seekers are assessed very carefully.&nbsp; Job seekers are counselled or advised on the nature of the job that they may be offered.&nbsp; They may be trained.&nbsp; Many CDCs are already placing them first and train them for the job so that they be gainfully employed and&nbsp;assisted so that they can keep the job long enough for them to get good income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yes, about 30% of job seekers have been assisted with placement.&nbsp; But placement may depend on many factors - the employers, the employees, readiness to be employed among potential employees.&nbsp; What we want to do is to make sure that job seekers will get a good chance to get the first job first.&nbsp; Many CDCs, as I said earlier, want to enhance their services by training them after placement, to make sure that they can keep the job long enough so that they can earn good income.&nbsp; And 60% of the workers who have been placed have been able to&nbsp;keep their jobs for more than three months.&nbsp; So, I think, across the CDCs and DCN, we have been doing better but, of course, things can be done even better to ensure that services can benefit more job seekers.</p></div></span>\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

This is comparable to the average of 22.2% among OECD countries. Nevertheless, it is lower than Japan (27.3%), the US (31.4%) and Sweden (42.9%). This is mainly because a large number of Singapore women would leave the workforce during the child-bearing age of about 30 and most never returned. Like Singapore, many countries see a dip in the female employment rates during child-bearing ages. However, our employment rate does not rise back&nbsp;thereafter, unlike in countries like Japan or Australia.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1504<p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <I>2006 Labour Force Survey</I>, about two-thirds (65%) of economically inactive women aged 55 to 64 cited housework as their main reason for not working.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One strategy to help females stay in or rejoin the workforce is to enable them to better manage their family and work commitments. The Ministry has therefore been working with companies to introduce workplace arrangements to enhance the work-life needs of their employees. This is spearheaded by the Tripartite Committee on Work-Life Strategy, chaired by me. And in 2004, MOM launched the $10 million Work-Life Works! (WoW!) Fund to help employers to introduce work-life measures at the workplace, with an emphasis on flexible work arrangements. So far, 445 companies have received grants to enhance their work-life strategies. The WoW!

WDA' s ADVANTAGE! Scheme provides funding up to $400,000 per company to encourage employers to facilitate the recruitment, retention and re-employment of older workers. The re-employment legislation, which will take effect by 1st January 2012, will also help to facilitate older workers to work longer. We will also enhance the&nbsp;Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) Scheme to give higher payouts to low-wage workers aged above 55 and&nbsp;60.

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim):</B>&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. It neither preaches nor condones aggression, violence and terrorism. Unfortunately, a small group of people has distorted the religion and has justified their acts of aggression in the name of Islam.&nbsp; In Singapore, our Muslim community is well-adjusted to life in a multi-religious and multi-racial society. Nonetheless, this is something we cannot take for granted.&nbsp; As an open economy which is well-<p align=left>Column: 1507<p>connected to the world through channels such as the Internet and other media, the community must be mindful of negative influences and ideology.&nbsp; And the community must fortify itself from such influences.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, religious development is central to the well-being of the Malay/Muslim community. MUIS, together with its many partners and stakeholders, has put in place a number of initiatives and programmes to ensure that Muslims lead a healthy religious life in Singapore, and that radical or extreme elements do not emerge in the community.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One key initiative is the Singapore Islamic Education System that MUIS has introduced.&nbsp; This is a system for part-time religious education. It has a progressive and inclusive curriculum, which helps to provide a strong religious foundation, based on the values and virtues of Islam.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also takes into account Singapore's multi-racial and&nbsp;multi-religious context, and that Singapore is a secular country.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUIS has also put in place programmes that focus on the young. It has formed the Youth Development Cluster consisting of the Youth Education and the Youth Engagement Strategic Units.&nbsp; Through these units, MUIS will continue to actively engage youth via multiple channels and platforms, including both the traditional and new media.&nbsp; For example, MUIS has recently launched a youth-friendly website \"INvoKe.SG\", targeting both schooling youth and young adults aged 15 to 35. This is a platform for MUIS to engage our youth so that they can gain Islamic knowledge from the right sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help young Muslims become more aware and be able to immunise themselves from radical or terrorist ideas and ideologies, MUIS' Youth Education Strategic Unit has been organising the \"Building Resilient Youth\" Seminars to highlight and <p align=left>Column: 1508<p>discuss issues which the youth should be concerned about. The Unit also maintains an Internet-based enquiry service for our young.&nbsp; Through this platform, youth can ask any religious question anonymously, and get answers from authoritative sources in simple, easy to understand language.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUIS has also set up the Students Resource Development Secretariat (SRDS) to keep in&nbsp;touch with students pursuing Islamic education overseas, and to help them stay connected to the developments in Singapore.&nbsp; This will help ensure that, upon their return, they are able to promote religious teachings that are relevant to Singapore's context.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUIS has also established the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS), which allows only credible and <I>bona fide</I> <I>asatizahs</I> (religious teachers) to teach in&nbsp;our mosques in Singapore.&nbsp; The ARS will help reassure the public of the credibility of our religious teachers.&nbsp; The Muslim community has accepted the religious teachers' directory as a trustworthy reference when they seek religious teachers.&nbsp; It is a safeguard against false teachers who preach self-serving beliefs.&nbsp; At the same time, MUIS is developing the local <I>asatizahs</I> by providing training to help them upgrade their skills and keep up with global developments.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When seeking religious knowledge, Muslims are encouraged to be guided by a qualified teacher.&nbsp; This applies to every Muslim, regardless of his educational background or social status.&nbsp; Hence, MUIS' efforts have focused on making available qualified religious instructors to guide the community, not only to be good Muslims but good citizens in a multi-racial and multi-religious context.&nbsp; At the same time, families must also play their part and be vigilant of the type of Islamic learning that their family members are seeking.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 1509<p><!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</B>&nbsp; I would like to thank the Minister for the very comprehensive answer.&nbsp; I understand that the Singapore Islamic Education System (SIES) is actually focused on young children and youth.&nbsp; I am just wondering whether the Minister has any plans to tweak the SIES to appeal more to the graduates and the professionals.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

We have a full agenda ahead of us. Foremost is the signing of the ASEAN Charter at the Summit in Singapore this November. We also expect the Leaders then to endorse a Blueprint with clear roadmaps for establishing the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. Similar blueprints for the Security and Socio-Cultural Communities will be initiated during our Chairmanship, to be ready by the next Summit towards the end of next year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The environment and climate change are also high up on our agenda.&nbsp; For the ASEAN and the East Asia Summits, the theme will be \"Energy, Environment, Climate Change and Sustainable Development\". We will be initiating practical cooperation projects that can help mitigate some of the effects of environmental degradation in our region and contribute to the global debate on climate change, particularly preparations for the 13th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali in December this year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also work to improve ASEAN's engagement of its Dialogue Partners. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of ASEAN's dialogue relations with the EU and the US, special summits will be held with the EU in November this year and with the US early next year. We will also mark the 10th anniversary of the ASEAN+3 process, which has significantly improved ASEAN's cooperation<p align=left>Column: 1512<p> with China, Japan and Korea. In addition, we will do a review of the ASEAN Regional Forum and see how we can take it to a higher level.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all issues on our agenda can be resolved within a year. Some should be considered as work in process for which we should add value during our watch. Integration, for example, is a long-term objective.

MOE will continue to work closely with our teachers to support them in making learning meaningful and engaging for students.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Therefore, sometimes, the schools do go beyond the syllabus because we have created a white space for them so that they can learn beyond the classroom as well.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me give you an example.&nbsp; I visited East Spring last week.&nbsp; There, they have a facility called Discovery Trail.&nbsp; In that Discovery Trail, they learn how to understand&nbsp;nature.&nbsp; In their Discovery Trail, they have facilities like bio-eco system to allow them to understand Science, Mathematics and so on.&nbsp; They also take the opportunity, as part of the Discovery Trail experience, to undertake physical exercises, because it is integrated with sports and games as well.&nbsp; We want our students to have a broad experience in their learning so that they can develop holistically.&nbsp; It is by design that our<p align=left>Column: 1516<p> curriculum has created white space to allow the schools to design additional material for their students based on the ability&nbsp;and&nbsp;profile of the students.</p></div></span>\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

We gave greater flexibility and autonomy to our schools and we give them resources so that they can evolve concepts, systems and models to suit the needs of their students.&nbsp; So different schools would adopt different models and some of them have been able to explore beyond their classroom.&nbsp; One example that I have given just now is from East Spring Primary School.&nbsp; Other schools have also incorporated the \"Teach Less, Learn More\" concept to bring their students to gardens and parks so that they can learn outside the classroom.&nbsp; The reception in general has been very positive and we allow the teachers and the school leaders to decide among themselves what would be best suited for each school, based on the profile of their students.</p></div></span>\t\t       \t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SCHOOL BULLYING--><p align=left>Column: 1516<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SCHOOL BULLYING:::1519--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

So I am wondering whether placing school bullying under the discipline category sometimes creates some confusion because, as we know, there are many grey areas in the definition of school bullying.&nbsp;

The courts can order a transfer of property and portions of CPF monies used for the purchase of that property to the ex-spouse. Upon the future sale of the property, such monies will be refunded, with accrued interest, to the ex-spouse's CPF account. This was the correct position that was set out in my Second Reading speech. But during the subsequent debate, I incorrectly mentioned that the refund was to the member's account. As the property has been transferred to the ex-spouse, it should be to the ex-spouse's account.

Singaporeans are living much longer than before. To ensure that we have enough retirement savings, we have to work <p align=left>Column: 1523<p>longer and make changes to our CPF system.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Facing our challenges squarely</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, there has been much public discussion on this important national issue.&nbsp; Rightly so, because having enough savings to last our lifespan affects us all.&nbsp; Many of us have dependants who are elderly.&nbsp; All of us want financial security when we grow old. So I think it is a good thing that Singaporeans are talking about this important issue openly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many wrote to CPF Board and MOM directly.&nbsp; I know that NTUC and other MPs had lively dialogue sessions with their constituents.&nbsp; REACH received emails and SMSes. The press - and you must have read some of them&nbsp;- published well-written letters from Singaporeans who were financially savvy and understood what the proposed changes were trying to achieve. And some of them&nbsp;gave good suggestions. Let me thank the public for their inputs, some of which have been very helpful. We will adopt workable ideas to accommodate the different needs of Singaporeans, wherever possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Singaporeans did however find the proposed changes to be complicated.&nbsp; A recent <I>Straits Times</I> ' poll also showed that a significant proportion did not fully understand the CPF system.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;taken this feedback to heart and, over the&nbsp;next few months, we will communicate simplified messages to the masses to better explain the new CPF system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While reactions to the changes have varied, Singaporeans, by and large, understand and accept the need to address the challenges of our ageing population now.&nbsp; They can see themselves and those around them ageing.&nbsp; This reality is clearly visible and hard to escape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1524<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take,&nbsp;for&nbsp;example, my constituency at Toa Payoh Central.&nbsp; It is an old estate&nbsp;and has many elderly residents. During each house-to-house visit, I invariably meet a few residents in their 80s and 90s -&nbsp;it is no longer a novelty. &nbsp;I am though looking forward to meeting someone above 100. So one day, I said to my residents, \"Why not maybe for the next Lunar New Year dinner that we have, to put up a notice that we will give prizes to those who are over-100 and still active.\"&nbsp; They came back and said, \"I think you have to prepare for not one, but a few prizes.\"&nbsp; Because they know that even in Toa Payoh, there are a few over 100 centenarians.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreigners, who come here, especially from younger ASEAN countries, note quickly that we are a greying population.&nbsp; These impressions of Singapore being a fast ageing society were confirmed by a recent UN study.&nbsp; So if you have noticed, looking around and all of us are growing old, it is true.&nbsp; This UN study projected that by 2050, Singapore could become the fourth oldest population in the world.&nbsp; If you look at the slides, we are climbing very high, from 116th position in 1950, projected to be fourth, above Europe, Asia and the world in 2050.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans must come to terms with our longevity, both individually and as a nation.&nbsp; And the quicker we do this, the better.&nbsp; Because whether we are ready or not, the inevitable consequences from increasing needs as more grow old within our society will be upon us soon. We must therefore tackle this challenge now, as we have done with other national issues which can affect our nation's well-being and future.&nbsp; Whether it is SARS, economic recession or terrorism, our approach is to think long-term and act quickly before a problem becomes unmanageable.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This collective and enlightened approach explains much of Singapore's success today.&nbsp; It has helped us avoid<p align=left>Column: 1525<p> many pitfalls that afflict other countries that are unwilling or unable to confront similar challenges decisively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must tackle the challenges of our ageing population with the same spirit of resolve and perseverance. In this Statement, I will fill in the details in the National Day Rally&nbsp;speech to present the complete picture of how we can improve the retirement security of Singaporeans.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst many views, different opinions and competing needs, we must remain focused and remind ourselves of the ultimate purpose for these changes. The ultimate goal is to&nbsp;put in place a better and sustainable CPF system that will help Singaporeans save enough for their full life spans.&nbsp; This surely must be the most important task at hand. This surely must be something that we need to do that will help generations of Singaporeans that will follow to better prepare for retirement.</p><p><br><I>Singaporeans -&nbsp;living very long</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We should begin by asking:&nbsp; how much longer are Singaporeans living?&nbsp; How many more years do we need to save for? We are already among the longest-living globally.&nbsp; Another UN study puts Singapore with a life expectancy at 80 years, close to the top of the table.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guess who is at the top?&nbsp; It is Japan at 83 years.&nbsp; The global average is&nbsp;about&nbsp;67 years.&nbsp; So we are about 13 years ahead of the global average.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we are living longer than most other populations is yet another indication that we have arrived as a First World country.&nbsp; We are living longer as a result of good healthcare, nutrition and a clean and good living environment, and this is a good thing.&nbsp; This is something that we should celebrate.&nbsp; Longevity is a blessing, something that everyone&nbsp; hopes for.&nbsp; It is all in our culture.&nbsp; That is why we wish each other a long life.&nbsp; My wife is a <p align=left>Column: 1526<p><I>peranakan</I> and during every Chinese New Year - it is a ritual - the children will have to go to the parents, the girls will have to kneel and&nbsp;offer tea and then say, \"<I>selamat tahun baru - umor panjang panjang</I>\"&nbsp;(Happy New Year, long life).&nbsp; The men will just have to bow and say the same thing.&nbsp; The children learn it very quickly even though they do not speak Malay, because if they do not say it right, they do not get an <I>ang pow.&nbsp;</I> And the prospective son-in-law must also say it correctly.&nbsp; Otherwise, he would not get the biggest prize of all!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wish our elders long lives and celebrate their birthdays.&nbsp; We want to see our children graduate, get married and play with our grandchildren, and,&nbsp;better still, see&nbsp;our grandchildren graduate and get married.&nbsp; And, indeed, that was what happened last night.&nbsp; I was at a dinner.&nbsp; One of our former MPs was gracious enough to invite me and I was honoured to attend.&nbsp; His daughter was getting married.&nbsp;So, at the <I>yam seng</I> stage, the whole clan trots up to the stage.&nbsp; This former MP brought along his grandmother.&nbsp; She stood there with the grandchildren - three lovely daughters, one son.&nbsp;&nbsp;The grandmother must have been happy&nbsp;to see the son has a successful career in business, now seeing her granddaughter become a doctor marrying the grand son-in-law who is also a doctor, and all their friends creating a \"ruckus\" and celebrating.&nbsp; It is a good life to live long and to see all of this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of us certainly want to be around&nbsp;to see the future Singapore as a modern thriving cosmopolitan city.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I will tell you that for those in their 50s now among us, some will even be around to see with their own eyes what the World and Singapore will be like in 2050.&nbsp; Yes, this will be humanly possible, because&nbsp;one in&nbsp;seven now will live beyond 95 years.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we are to look forward to and enjoy our golden years, we must prepare <p align=left>Column: 1527<p>early, to ensure that we have enough savings for our old age, so that we can cope with infirmity or illness, that we will not be left stranded because the children are unable or unwilling to take care of their parents.&nbsp; We do not want this to happen.&nbsp; We do not want children not to take care of their parents.&nbsp; But you and I know that&nbsp;when they see us at our meet-the-people sessions, it does happen. These changes to the CPF system will help us achieve better retirement security for Singaporeans, and it can be done.&nbsp; It will mean&nbsp;adjustments for each of us, but we are in a far better&nbsp;position than many countries which have waited too long and the problem grown too large.&nbsp; Otherwise, instead of growing old being a cause for joy, it can be the opposite.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Singaporeans were told that the average life expectancy at birth had increased from 61 years in 1957 to 80 years now, many were surprised.&nbsp; Some, I know, still do not believe that Singaporeans will live so long.&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have had&nbsp;their fair share of reasons.&nbsp; But if&nbsp;we ask them why they do not think that they will live so long,&nbsp;we get a potpourri of urban myths, and we can trade myths and collect them and write a book or something.&nbsp; Some of the theories are very fascinating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;one that I heard recently from&nbsp;my resident deserves a prize, at least, for being the most innovative.&nbsp; This group of disbelievers concedes that the present life expectancy of 80 years is correct.&nbsp; I think they saw the slides that&nbsp;the Prime Minister showed during the National Day Rally on Radin Mas.&nbsp; It cannot be a fake.&nbsp; It must be true that there are a lot of old people living around.&nbsp; They say, \"This is because the elderly that we have now were born in China, India or wherever they came from.&nbsp; They were farm-folk.&nbsp; True Singaporeans, born and bred in modern Singapore, won't live as long!\"&nbsp; I am not sure if we should include this definition, because if we did, just imagine<p align=left>Column: 1528<p> our burial places&nbsp;-&nbsp;one section, true Singaporeans, and another, not so true Singaporeans.&nbsp; The price for membership for the true Singaporeans will be very high, literally cost you your life.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the urban myths are not founded on facts.&nbsp; It is precisely because so many individuals do not anticipate how much longer they will live, that we have to act now and ensure that all Singaporeans make provision for their old age.&nbsp; Left to themselves, we know what many would do -&nbsp;too many would leave things to chance,&nbsp;prepare inadequately or, worse, not at all.&nbsp; It is neither fair nor sustainable to expect others and society to assume the full burden of meeting our needs.&nbsp; Government must always help those who are poor but it would be too heavy a burden for society if each of us has not prepared for&nbsp;our own retirement needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 2030, 23 years from now, we will have nearly 900,000 residents above 65 years, one in&nbsp;five Singaporeans then.&nbsp; So, imagine 8 1/2 Toa Payoh Towns.&nbsp; If we go house-to-house, in every home,&nbsp;there will&nbsp;be residents, the youngest of whom will be 65 years.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must not construct a national plan for our retirement needs based on how long each individual thinks he might live or on anecdotal incidents or wild theories, because&nbsp;it would be seriously flawed.&nbsp; We must build our retirement framework on solid facts, not subjective opinions.&nbsp; We must rely on actuarial data that the insurance companies use and reliable information from the Department of Statistics (DOS) that is updated constantly to give the true picture of how long Singaporeans are living as a whole.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to DOS, of those aged 62 in 2006,&nbsp;one in&nbsp;two will live beyond 85;&nbsp;one in&nbsp;seven to age 95; and&nbsp;one in 20 to age 100.&nbsp; Sir, in this House, half the Chamber will live to 85.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be sitting on the right or wrong side of the House, half will live to 85.&nbsp; One in seven,<p align=left>Column: 1529<p> it means that the Frontbench may contain as many people who are 95, and there will be a few, if the House has 100 Members, one in 20, that means there will be five of us who will live to 100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of those numbers that I have cited, more&nbsp;of them will be&nbsp;women, because&nbsp;women do live longer than men. But, generally, of those who stop work at age 62, it means that more than half will have to provide for more than&nbsp;20 years of retirement.&nbsp; Because if one in two will live beyond 85 and they stop work at 62, more than half will have to provide for more than 20 years of retirement.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twenty or more years of retirement is a long time.&nbsp; Even if&nbsp;one works for forty years,&nbsp;he has to plan early to make sure&nbsp;he has saved enough. This is why making provision for unanticipated longevity is a priority for us now.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Make provision for your own retirement needs</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another important reason why each of us must set aside enough for our own retirement needs: there will be too few younger people to depend on. Today, many old people look to their children for support.&nbsp; This is good and right and why we recently made it easier to top up the CPF accounts of family members. We must continue to hold firmly to&nbsp;the value of filial piety where children support their parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Children must support their parents&nbsp;emotionally and financially. As Bertha Henson of the <I>Straits Times</I> recently wrote - if parents are not receiving income from their children, they should just ask.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But fewer babies now and in the past decades will mean smaller families and more single households in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a clear graphic representation of how increasing longevity and fewer<p align=left>Column: 1530<p> babies have affected Singapore, I can think of none clearer than our demographic profile that Members see on the screen right now.&nbsp; In the 1970s, it was the Eiffel Tower.&nbsp; Now, it is the middle bulge.&nbsp; In 2030, it will be heavy at the top.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economists usually use statistics called a support ratio.&nbsp; It is that green bar supporting the ones on the top - those aged 15 to 64 supporting those who are on the orange bar.&nbsp; Members will note that those in the green ones are aged 15 to 64 but, in our circumstances,&nbsp;the economically active ones really begin from 25, but to standardise, we say we start from 15.&nbsp; But recognise that those 15 to 64 will also have to support those who are on top as well as children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the support ratio.&nbsp; In 1960, 23 people aged 15 to 64 supported&nbsp;one person aged 65 and above.&nbsp; Now, it is eight; by 2020 it will be five, and by 2030 only&nbsp;four.&nbsp; As I said, you have to support those above 65 and younger Singaporeans as well.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;nearly a six-fold reduction compared to 1960. We will not be able to depend on so few economically-active persons to shoulder the full burden of supporting the elderly, themselves and their children.&nbsp; Each of us must set aside enough for our own retirement needs.&nbsp; Then, the income from our children can be extra.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now touch on the three fundamental changes&nbsp;that the Prime Minister&nbsp;outlined that will help better prepare us individually and as a nation for our ageing population&nbsp; -&nbsp;working longer, improving CPF returns and making savings last for one's life expectancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I)&nbsp; WORKING LONGER</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, working longer.&nbsp; The&nbsp;re-employment legislation will kick in by 2012 to 65, then 67 years.&nbsp; Mr Gan Kim Yong's Tripartite Committee will work through the practical aspects.&nbsp; They will <p align=left>Column: 1531<p>produce guidelines for employers and employees, and this will be ready within two years.&nbsp; The guidelines will serve as a reference manual to provide clarity on terms and conditions for re-employment and platforms for dispute resolution.&nbsp; Under these guidelines, the majority will be offered re-employment.&nbsp; But it may not be in the same job or with the same pay.&nbsp; Even with legislation, the best assurance for a worker to remain employable is to stay healthy and economically productive.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government will step up its efforts and assistance programmes.&nbsp; We have the ADVANTAGE! Scheme to make work easier for older Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some Members&nbsp;may have seen this advertisement.&nbsp; Through the efforts of NTUC and WDA, many companies have already adopted re-employment practices voluntarily.&nbsp; What they say is, \"We know that the law is coming in.&nbsp; It doesn't make sense to wait till then, because our HR practices will have to scramble.&nbsp;&nbsp;Better to do it now before the law comes into effect.\"&nbsp; So they are well prepared by then.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Lim Swee Say says, \"Let's get moving.\" &nbsp;We can find jobs for older workers.&nbsp; Our economy created 180,000 jobs last year. In the first six months of this year, a further 114,000 jobs were created.&nbsp; Our economy can surely absorb 20,000 older workers.&nbsp; Minister of State Gan Kim Yong will say more about our on-going efforts to achieve higher employment rates for older workers.</p><p><br><I>More Workfare for older workers</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another slide to help older workers work longer is Workfare.&nbsp; Currently, the maximum Workfare income supplement is $100 a month, or $1,200 a year.&nbsp; We will increase the Workfare Income Supplement&nbsp;for older workers.&nbsp; For those aged 55 to 60,</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>the maximum payout will be increased by 50% to $150 a month ($1,800 a year).&nbsp; For those above 60, we will increase the maximum payment by 100% to $200 a month (or $2,400 a year).&nbsp; This means<p align=left>Column: 1532<p> that for a worker earning $1,000 a month, the Government, through Workfare, will top up 20% of his wages.&nbsp; It is significant.&nbsp;&nbsp;The self-employed above 55 years will similarly get higher Workfare Income Supplement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes will be implemented immediately.&nbsp; This means for those above 55 years, they&nbsp;will receive higher Workfare Income Supplement payments in January 2008 when the scheme starts and for work already done in the first half of this year.&nbsp; More than 50% of older workers are expected to get WIS.&nbsp; Higher WIS will cost $80 million more and will bring the total cost of WIS to over $400 million per year.&nbsp; If more older workers join the workforce, as I believe that they will, it will cost even more for&nbsp;WIS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>II) INCREASE CPF RETURNS<br><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, increasing CPF returns.&nbsp; Let me,&nbsp;first, describe the changes, and then explain how they will benefit members. There will be two structural changes made to the CPF interest rates system&nbsp; - an extra interest of 1% and re-pegging of the rate on the Special, Medisave and Retirement Accounts (what we call the SMRA).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Extra interest tier</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extra 1% of interest will be paid on the first $60,000 of a member's combined balances, with up to $20,000 from the Ordinary Account (OA).&nbsp; This means that either $20,000 can come from the OA and $40,000 from the SMRA or all $60,000 can come from the SMRA (if he has nothing in his OA, for instance),&nbsp;or something in between.&nbsp; Those amounts will receive an extra 1%.&nbsp; The extra&nbsp;interest from the Ordinary Account will go into the member's Special Account or Retirement Account&nbsp;to improve his retirement savings,&nbsp;but the 2.5% of the Ordinary Account will go back to the Ordinary Account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1533<p><p><I>New CPFIS restrictions</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All OA monies can still be used for existing housing, CPF insurance, and education schemes.&nbsp; But in view of the extra interest being paid, the first $20,000 in both the Ordinary Account and Special Account will no longer be allowed for use in the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS).&nbsp; These restrictions on CPFIS will apply from 1st April 2008 because we need some time&nbsp;for product providers and CPF Board to make the changes.&nbsp; Money already invested in CPFIS will not be affected.&nbsp; Even after these restrictions, $42 billion of CPF monies will still be available for use in CPFIS. So, I do not think there will be any adverse impact on the markets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>OA rate unchanged</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinary Account contains short-term money, like a savings account which members can withdraw on demand to invest in housing or other assets.&nbsp; They are in there&nbsp;for a shorter duration.&nbsp; And this is the reason why the OA interest rate is lower than that for SMR accounts which contain \"long-term\" money.&nbsp; The OA rate formula remains unchanged and will still have a guaranteed floor at 2.5%.&nbsp; There is also no change to the HDB concessionary loan interest rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>SMRA - long-term market rate</I></p><p><I><br></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money placed in the SMRA for the long term ought to enjoy a higher rate of return than the Ordinary Account.&nbsp; We had previously announced in 2002 that we would re-peg the SMRA rate to an appropriate long-term bond yield.&nbsp; We will now do so together with the other CPF changes.&nbsp; How do we choose the new peg? &nbsp;The new peg for SMRA should be financially sound.&nbsp; It should be based on market returns for the same risk and duration that the SMRA monies stay in<p align=left>Column: 1534<p> their accounts.&nbsp; It should be simple to understand and widely quoted.&nbsp; There should also be no currency risk.&nbsp; These are some of the parameters that we set out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ideal peg would be a 30-year Singapore Government Security (SGS), because this is about the average time the members' SMRA monies stay in those accounts.&nbsp; \"Long bonds\" of such duration are issued by countries like Japan, the United States and Europe.&nbsp; Singapore's longest duration bonds are the 15-year and the 20-year SGS, but these are not actively traded and therefore not suitable as a peg.&nbsp; The 10-year SGS (10Y SGS) is, however, actively traded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have therefore decided to set the SMRA rate as the yield of the 10-year SGS plus 1%.&nbsp; Why plus 1%?&nbsp; Because this will adequately provide for the difference that we would expect between the interest on the 10-year SGS yields, which we are using as a peg, and the 30-year Singapore Government Securities, if it did&nbsp;exist.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SMRA rate will be set quarterly, as before.&nbsp; A month before the next quarter, we will compute the new SMRA rate from the average daily yields of the 10-year SGS benchmark of the previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, we take the daily yields of the preceding year of the 10-year SGS benchmark and derive a number.&nbsp; The average 10-year SGS yield computed on this basis would now be&nbsp;3.0%.&nbsp; But because we said the SMRA rate would be 10-year SGS plus 1%, the SMRA rate will be&nbsp;4.0%.&nbsp; For members' information, had the new SMRA formula been in place since the first issue of the 10-year SGS -&nbsp;in other words if we had this formula in 1998 when the first issue of the 10-year&nbsp;SGS was in place -&nbsp;the SMRA rate would have averaged 4.5%.&nbsp; It is more important to look at the long-term rate rather than just the daily fluctuations because this is a long-term account, and<p align=left>Column: 1535<p> this is the duration that members' monies stay in.&nbsp; So, that will be the effective rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our new interest rates system will start on 1st January 2008.&nbsp; To help members adjust to the floating SMRA rate, we will keep the 4% floor for the SMRA rate for the first two years.&nbsp; This 4% floor will also apply to the extra interest tier, in the very unlikely event that the 10-year SGS rate falls below 2%.&nbsp; After two years, the 2.5% floor rate will apply for all accounts as prescribed under the CPF Act.&nbsp;In other words, 4% floor will be there for two years, after which the 2.5% floor as prescribed under the Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Gains from higher CPF</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can be very technical.&nbsp; So, let me now explain how members will benefit from the new interest rate structure. I will try to make it easy because there are many figures to absorb. The OA formula remains unchanged but the first $20,000 in the OA will receive the extra 1% interest and will therefore receive at least 3.5%.&nbsp; Now, 3.5% compared to 2.5% is a 40% increase.&nbsp;&nbsp;The new SMRA rate calculated now based on 10-year SGS yield plus 1% would be 4%.&nbsp; Part or all of the SMRA balances will also receive an extra 1%, depending on how much a member has in the OA balances.&nbsp; For example, if he has $20,000 in his OA, the first $40,000 in the SMRA will receive 5%.&nbsp; If a member has less or no OA monies, up to the first $60,000 in the SMRA will receive 5%.&nbsp; This higher CPF interest will increase members' CPF savings substantially.&nbsp; Compared to the current system, a member with $60,000 in his combined accounts&nbsp;will get $7,200 more in 10 years and $17,900 more in 20 years in his CPF savings. This is more.&nbsp; So, if you look at his total balance, the total balance will go up.&nbsp; But compared to the current system, this is the amount that he will get more in 10 or 20 years.&nbsp; It is substantial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1536<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members might be asking, well, that is for the individual members.&nbsp; But for&nbsp;the current CPF members, what proportion will benefit from this?&nbsp; First, under the new system, all CPF members will receive higher interest payments.&nbsp; All, and&nbsp;I mean all; no one will receive less.&nbsp; In fact, 70% of all CPF members will&nbsp;receive the extra 1% on all their CPF monies they have, because they have less than $60,000.&nbsp; So, 70% of all&nbsp;our CPF members will receive that 1% on all their CPF monies.&nbsp;In the handouts to be distributed to MPs and the press, I&nbsp;have listed more examples so that you can understand&nbsp; this.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;listed members with different balances, how much they will get.&nbsp; We will give you time to try to absorb this, and I know that&nbsp;it is technical.&nbsp; But with the new interest rate structure, Government will pay at least $700 million more interest per year, and $700 million more per year&nbsp;is&nbsp;equal to about&nbsp;the Government's annual grant to HDB, which is about $750 million a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Reasons for new interest rate system<br></I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have asked why and how we have chosen this new interest rate system.&nbsp; Some of you will remember that in 2002, the Economic Review Committee had recommended that CPF monies be managed in private pension plans so that we can achieve&nbsp;higher returns.&nbsp; We studied this proposal thoroughly.&nbsp; We held extensive discussions within Government and with industry experts.&nbsp; We looked at the problem from many angles but always came to the&nbsp;unavoidable conclusion&nbsp;- to get higher returns, members must expose their CPF money to more market risks.&nbsp; That is what the experts say - cannot compensate for market risks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried to devise many schemes to shield members from volatility yet delivering higher returns - stabilisation funds, trying to round it, very technical, sat through all those meetings.&nbsp; But we decided it was neither possible nor right.&nbsp; Because it would mean subsidising losses <p align=left>Column: 1537<p>using other members' or taxpayers' money.&nbsp; We decided that, for now, it would be unwise to go&nbsp;the full investment route because the majority of members do not have large balances, and it would be too risky for older members.&nbsp; The&nbsp;recent financial market turmoil serves as a timely reminder of the risks that exist.&nbsp; Hence, we should retain the risk-free framework but with a more appropriate SMRA peg.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have asked if this system is fair.&nbsp; Are rates of return set too low or too high?&nbsp; Why is the extra interest only 1%, not more?&nbsp; Why not apply the extra interest on an amount greater than $60,000?&nbsp; The CPF system is not meant to be subsidised.&nbsp; It is a system based on savings.&nbsp; It is not a tax system. If it is subsidised, it must mean that we tax one group to give another group more.&nbsp; Subsidies should be given in other ways and even then only to those who deserve it most.&nbsp; We have put in place a long-term framework which provides a fair rate of return on CPF monies that compares well with any offer from private pension plans.&nbsp; Most importantly, our CPF system minimises the financial risk to members. The new system has to be justified to the President, that the Government can afford it, and that it will not draw on past reserves.&nbsp; Minister Tharman, Second Minister&nbsp;for Finance,&nbsp;will say more on this.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new interest rate system is more than fair since it is still essentially risk-free.&nbsp; The extra interest is structured so that it will benefit all, but those with small and middle-size balances will benefit more.&nbsp; The SMR rate will float with bond yields.&nbsp; This allows members to gain when interest rates go up, but ensures that what the member has accumulated in his accounts is totally protected and guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if the interest rates come down, the member will not lose any of his savings -&nbsp;in fact, he will always<p align=left>Column: 1538<p> earn at least 2.5% per year on his savings and the extra 1% for the first $60,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have decided on this as the new long-term CPF interest rate structure.&nbsp; This is the framework that we are adopting long term.&nbsp; We have used previous long-term market trends to guide us in formulating this new structure.&nbsp; But, of course,&nbsp;no one can predict how the financial markets will behave in the future.&nbsp; As the caveat says, past performances do not predict future earnings.&nbsp; And in particular, no one can predict how the interest rates will behave in the future.&nbsp; So, we will therefore review the formula for CPF interest rates after five years, to finetune it if necessary.&nbsp; But, we will keep this general structure that fulfils the objective of paying a good and fair interest to all CPF members for their retirement needs, while benefiting lower and lower-middle income&nbsp;CPF members more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those with more than $60,000, who want to be exposed to greater risks for possible higher returns, we can consider options to help them invest their CPF monies in the future.&nbsp; But, I think, it is better to settle the present major changes, put in place a sensible framework, a fair and generous framework,&nbsp;so as to give certainty and higher returns to those with less savings.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(III) MAKING SAVINGS LAST LIFE EXPECTANCY<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Later draw-down for longer payouts</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk on the third aspect - making savings last life expectancy.&nbsp; Even with higher CPF interest and Workfare, many members will run out of savings if we start the draw-down age (DDA) at 62, the current draw-down age.&nbsp;Why? Simply because, 60% of members will live longer than 82 years. By then,&nbsp;most would not be able to work. So I think it is better to work longer when you are<p align=left>Column: 1539<p> younger and able, and to draw down later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will raise the draw-down age&nbsp;to 65 and eventually to 67, in line with the re-employment law.&nbsp;But we will increase the draw-down age progressively, after the re-employment laws take place.&nbsp; In fact, the draw-down age will reach 65 only in 2018, and this is six years after the legislation would have been in place.&nbsp; From the current 62 years, the draw-down age will be first pushed up to 63 in 2012, to 64 in 2015 and then to 65 in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the re-employment law comes into effect in 2012.&nbsp; The draw-down age at 65 comes into effect in 2018, six years later.&nbsp; I think this&nbsp;provides enough time for everyone to adjust to the new conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those aged 57 or younger today will be affected by the later DDA.&nbsp; If you want to know whether you are affected if you are 57 and younger, the new draw-down age will apply to you.&nbsp; For those aged 50 to 57, who have a shorter runway to adjust, we will help them with one-off bonuses.&nbsp; These bonuses will&nbsp;be paid&nbsp;into their Retirement Accounts to help them increase&nbsp;their retirement savings.&nbsp;It would not be in cash.&nbsp; It would be into their CPF accounts.&nbsp; There are two types of bonuses&nbsp;-&nbsp;the&nbsp;Deferment Bonuses and the Voluntary Deferment Bonuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>D-Bonus</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about D-Bonus.&nbsp; All those aged 50 to 57 this year will receive D-Bonuses, because they will start their DDA later.&nbsp; The D-Bonus will be in the form of a bonus interest, based on the members' balances in their Retirement Accounts, but it will be capped at $30,000.&nbsp; This means that 86% of all members, nearly 90%,&nbsp;will get the bonus interest on the full amount in their Retirement Accounts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older members will receive larger D-Bonuses.&nbsp; Those aged 54 to 57 will <p align=left>Column: 1540<p>receive 5% on their Retirement Account sums.&nbsp; What it means is that&nbsp;if you&nbsp;have&nbsp;$30,000 now and&nbsp;you are aged 57, you&nbsp;will receive 5%, which is&nbsp;$1,500, substantial.&nbsp; Those aged 52&nbsp;to 53 will receive 4% on Retirement Account balances, which means up to a maximum of $1,200,&nbsp;and those aged 50 and 51 will receive 3% on their Retirement Account balances, up to a maximum of $900. I hope you are doing your own calculations to see how much you will receive.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those above 55, they will receive their D-Bonuses on 1st May 2008.&nbsp; For the rest, they will receive it when they turn 55.&nbsp; The Deferment Bonuses alone&nbsp;will cost the Government up to $650 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>V-Bonus</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me talk about&nbsp;the Voluntary Deferment Bonuses (V-Bonuses).&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want&nbsp;to encourage members to voluntarily defer their drawdown, even if they are allowed to start drawing down from their Retirement Accounts their&nbsp;Minimum Sums&nbsp;before 65 because&nbsp;the later you&nbsp;draw down, because that whole sum is capped and receives interest, the longer the payout.&nbsp; It is not just one for one.&nbsp; It does not mean that if it is delayed for one year, you will get one year of payout.&nbsp; In fact, if you delay for one year, you get three years more payouts.&nbsp; That is the way the Mathematics work.&nbsp; So we want to encourage this.&nbsp; A Voluntary Deferment Bonus, or V-Bonus, will be given for each year of voluntary deferment up to the age of 65.&nbsp; So&nbsp;members aged 54 to 63 this year who have not started&nbsp;drawing down are eligible.&nbsp; The V-Bonus would be set at 2%&nbsp;on the members' RA balances, capped at $30,000.&nbsp; And therefore&nbsp;a member&nbsp;will get&nbsp;$600 for each year deferred,&nbsp;in other words,&nbsp;if he defers for&nbsp;three years, he&nbsp;receives up to $1,800.&nbsp; The Voluntary Deferment Bonuses alone will cost the Government up to $570 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1541<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have put down in the table what the total bonuses are.&nbsp; It ranges from $600 to $2,700.&nbsp; If members will agree,&nbsp;that&nbsp;can substantially improve and&nbsp;that can translate to many years of payouts.&nbsp; The D- and V-Bonuses will also be given to those who have bought or&nbsp;will buy annuities, since they have provided for their full life expectancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Total gains</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the impact of all these changes on Singaporeans?&nbsp; This is the most important question.&nbsp; Singaporeans will&nbsp;ask: how can I benefit?&nbsp;&nbsp;Will it make a difference?&nbsp; Working longer, more Workfare, higher CPF interest and Deferment Bonuses will improve retirement savings substantially for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; Let me now put&nbsp;together all the&nbsp;gains that I have talked about from&nbsp;the changes -&nbsp;the higher CPF, Workfare, the Deferment Bonuses - and give you an example that you can&nbsp;see the substantial magnitude and&nbsp;how it will improve the CPF retirement savings of a typical worker by a large amount.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will use a&nbsp;57-year-old worker, a low-wage worker, who indeed these changes are aimed at, although all CPF members will gain.&nbsp; Let us call him Mr Tan, and I have chosen 57, not someone younger in the 40s, because these changes&nbsp;also will help those in their 50s.&nbsp; Mr Tan earns&nbsp;$1,200 a month, such a member would have&nbsp;typically $21,000 in his Retirement Account now.&nbsp; Under the current rules, if he works till&nbsp;62, stops work at 62,&nbsp;he would have about $36,000 in his Retirement Account.&nbsp;$36,000 is not a large sum&nbsp;and may not last his retirement period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the changes&nbsp;- the higher Workfare, the higher CPF and the Deferment Bonuses -&nbsp; if he is re-employed even at a lower pay of, say, $1,000, and <p align=left>Column: 1542<p>he works&nbsp;one year more and draws down one year later at&nbsp;63, how much would&nbsp;he&nbsp;have accumulated under all our changes? &nbsp;$11,000 more, just for one year of work and one year of draw down.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, he gains 30% more on his Retirement Account savings, which means&nbsp;three more years of payout, at&nbsp;$330 a month, compared to $270 a month, with just&nbsp;one year more&nbsp;of work and deferment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this same worker, Mr Tan, decides that he will work till age 65 and also draws down his CPF at age 65, how much will he have?&nbsp; He will have $60,000 in his CPF savings.&nbsp;$24,000 more&nbsp;as compared to&nbsp; age 62 under the old system. That is a 60% increase on his principal sum which is a terrific rate of return for any investment.&nbsp;So, someone who is aged 57 can increase his CPF savings substantially from these changes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These changes proposed will significantly improve the retirement sums of older workers, even for those who are in their 50s now. And the gains for younger members will be even more.&nbsp; So, MPs should advise their constituents to continue to work and delay their draw down for as long as they can, while topping up their Retirement Accounts. Because if they do so, they can benefit fully from all these changes and it will make a big difference to their retirement savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Total cost to Government</I></p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have asked what is Government's role&nbsp;in improving the retirement adequacy for Singaporeans. How is Government helping in these reforms? How is Government helping all Singaporeans? Government is committed to helping Singaporeans, and the total cost of the entire package of CPF reforms and measures for secure retirement is substantial.&nbsp; The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), in total, will cost over $400<p align=left>Column: 1543<p> million each year.&nbsp; The higher CPF interest will cost $700 million more in the first year, and more in subsequent years as balances grow. Higher Workfare&nbsp;and&nbsp;CPF interests are long-term commitments.&nbsp; It is not a one-off exercise, in other words, this is recurrent cost and the Government will have to spend more each year.&nbsp; In fact, we have to spend more than $1.1 billion every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is equivalent to members receiving half a Progress Package every year, or one Progress Package every two years. The one-off package of D- and V-Bonuses will cost more than $1.2 billion. I think it is right and fair that each person makes provision for his own retirement needs, but we are not asking&nbsp;Singaporeans to do this alone. Because Government will be expending considerable resources every year to help Singaporeans to work longer and improve their retirement savings.&nbsp; Our commitment to Singaporeans is substantial.&nbsp; It would be more than $1.1 billion every year to help them achieve this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(IV) LIVING LONGER THAN EXPECTED<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Longevity Insurance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now talk on longevity insurance.&nbsp; I know there has been much discussion on this aspect.&nbsp; And I am glad that there has been much discussion because this is something new and people need to get used to it.&nbsp; Some of you will remember when the Prime Minister talked in the National Day Rally, he mentioned a particular constituent&nbsp;that he had in Teck Ghee whom he met at Radin Mas.&nbsp; This was a lady who had some back problems, went for a spinal operation and now she is recovering.&nbsp; And she&nbsp;asked a pertinent question to our Prime Minister.&nbsp; She said, \"Savings are running out.&nbsp; What do I do?\"&nbsp; We have to ask ourselves, \"What do we do if the 900,000 Singaporeans, among them a large portion, have their savings&nbsp; run out?\"&nbsp; So, in addition to the&nbsp;changes that I have talked about, we&nbsp;need to improve the CPF system so that members<p align=left>Column: 1544<p> will not run out of their CPF savings in their extreme old age.&nbsp; Some say that they will not be so fortunate to live so long.&nbsp; And there are indeed those with serious illnesses who are&nbsp;certified by doctors to have severely shortened life spans.&nbsp; And the CPF rules now already allow these members with limited life spans to&nbsp;take out&nbsp;their CPF money early.&nbsp; But most of us cannot predict when our time will be up.&nbsp; We have to go by actuarial data that tell us that&nbsp;many Singaporeans will live beyond 85, to 90 and even to 100 or older.&nbsp; Any one of us could be in that group.&nbsp; And the CPF scheme should therefore ensure that members make provision to support themselves so that their CPF savings will not run out prematurely. And the way to do this is through longevity insurance.&nbsp; If we did it ourselves, it must mean that we must put aside for many more years.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you start from 65, you do not know whether you are going to live to 95.&nbsp; So you have to put aside your savings for 30 years or longer.&nbsp; Because if you reach 95 and you are still alive, your savings would have run out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So&nbsp;longevity insurance is the cheapest way to ensure that the member does not run out of savings prematurely.&nbsp; He will receive an income for as long as he lives.&nbsp; Many of us buy insurance to provide for our dependants, in case of&nbsp;premature death.&nbsp; It is money spent and gone if nothing untoward happens.&nbsp; And we pay for this insurance willingly just in case something&nbsp;happens and&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;peace of mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But buying insurance for ourselves in case we live longer than expected is new to&nbsp;Singaporeans.&nbsp; So let me briefly explain how it works. When you buy a longevity insurance, which is a deferred annuity, in other words, you take on the stream of income later, a deferred annuity, you will receive a monthly income from a pre-determined age, at the \"tail-end\", and for as long as you live.&nbsp; To simplify the issue,<p align=left>Column: 1545<p> it is assumed that the start age of the deferred annuity&nbsp;is 85 (although it could start at any age).&nbsp; For this scheme, members pay a premium to buy a&nbsp;longevity insurance at age 55.&nbsp; So&nbsp;the premiums&nbsp;from all participating members form a common pool.&nbsp; The pool of money is invested and grows year by year, and pays an income to all those who are alive after age 85, for as long as they live.&nbsp; They are sharing the risks.&nbsp; Because the risks are shared, some will get more than what they put into the scheme, if they live longer.&nbsp; Correspondingly, those who do not live as long will get less than the premium they paid.&nbsp; If you want your dependants to get some money back when you pass on prematurely, then it&nbsp;is possible&nbsp;for the upfront premiums to go to them.&nbsp; It is possible for some of the money to go back to them but you have to pay&nbsp;higher upfront premiums.&nbsp;There are many variations possible, just like&nbsp;insurance policies. Basically, it is an insurance product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>A National Longevity Insurance Scheme</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is right to require CPF members to make financial provision for the eventuality that they live longer than expected.&nbsp; By then, they certainly will not be able to work and may not have&nbsp;any family members to depend on. And this is the basic goal in devising a national longevity insurance scheme. We will therefore require CPF members to take up some form of annuity, or longevity insurance scheme, using a small part of their Retirement Account.&nbsp; But most of the CPF balance in their Retirement Account will still be available to be drawn down from the draw-down age.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our main objective is to put in place a national scheme that provides basic longevity protection for CPF members, starting with those who are aged 50 years and below now.&nbsp; Some members of the<p align=left>Column: 1546<p> public have written to the press to support this idea and suggested that it should be modelled after the MediShield concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is indeed our thinking.&nbsp; Like MediShield, the CPF Board can administer the basic tier of longevity insurance.&nbsp; For members who want more than&nbsp;basic protection, they can buy additional insurance, or what we call&nbsp;riders, which can be provided by commercial insurance providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Longevity Insurance Scheme, as a risk-pooling scheme, will be fair to all.&nbsp; This means that premiums will be adjusted according to risks.&nbsp; Women generally live longer than men, other things being equal.&nbsp; This explains why commercial insurance providers already charge higher premiums for women buying longevity insurance.&nbsp; It is practised worldwide.&nbsp; Actual premiums will be correctly calculated by professional actuaries.&nbsp; So there should&nbsp;be no reason to fear that this scheme is loaded against anyone or any group.&nbsp; It is meant to be fair to all.&nbsp; It is risk-sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have asked about costs.&nbsp; The extra interest that members will get in the new CPF system will be more than enough to pay for this longevity insurance.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have already given the example that a member with $60,000 in his CPF savings will get $7,200 more in 10 years, and nearly $18,000 more in 20 years.&nbsp; This will be more than enough to pay for the longevity insurance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Longevity Insurance Scheme will strengthen our CPF system as it takes care of extreme longevity.&nbsp; However, we also recognise that CPF members will have different needs.&nbsp; We have received many suggestions from members of the public on various options that are more suited to their own needs.&nbsp; Some younger members want to participate in annuity schemes because it is cheaper to come in early.&nbsp; The earlier you buy, the cheaper, and they want to come<p align=left>Column: 1547<p> in.&nbsp; Some who are older also want to be included, because they have no dependants and their savings are for themselves.&nbsp; So it does not make sense to put aside for someone else and&nbsp;say, \"Can you convert it to an annuity?&nbsp; Can I join your scheme?\"&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third group.&nbsp; These are those who have&nbsp;dependants who can take care of them, or have other savings apart from&nbsp;CPF.&nbsp; They want the balance in their Retirement Accounts to&nbsp;go to their dependants when they pass away.&nbsp; They are prepared to stretch out their Retirement Accounts to last longer.&nbsp; Instead of 20 years, they&nbsp;ask, \"Can I stretch it out to&nbsp;30 years instead of 20?\"&nbsp; They are prepared to&nbsp;draw less every month.&nbsp; But they say, \"I am prepared to stretch this out, draw less and reduce my need for longevity insurance.\"&nbsp; I think we should accommodate all these groups if we can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be flexible in accommodating the different circumstances of CPF members and offer different ways to provide for their full life expectancy.&nbsp; He can do this&nbsp;by buying a longevity insurance or by stretching out his Retirement Account money over a&nbsp;longer period and&nbsp;reduce his dependence&nbsp;on longevity insurance.&nbsp; So long as he has provided for his old age, and will not run out of savings prematurely, we should all be satisfied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we design a National Longevity Insurance Scheme to ensure that CPF members are adequately provided for financially, for the rest of their life, and do not run out of&nbsp;CPF savings?&nbsp; How can we accommodate these various needs and&nbsp;circumstances of members?&nbsp; I propose to form a committee to study this problem, and to take in public and professional views.&nbsp; The committee will then recommend the best way to provide basic, affordable and flexible longevity protection for all CPF members.&nbsp; The recommended plans should provide various options for members to protect<p align=left>Column: 1548<p> themselves.&nbsp; It should also allow members to opt-in to this scheme early, when it is less expensive to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked Professor Lim Pin to chair this committee, and he will be supported by other able and knowledgeable persons, including those from academia who understand this financial problem and the financial modelling.&nbsp; I have also included&nbsp;people from the grassroots because they understand their needs, and some from&nbsp;non-governmental organisations from the social groups.&nbsp; Unions will&nbsp;be represented.&nbsp; Let us hear their views.&nbsp; What are the needs?&nbsp; How do we explain it?&nbsp; How do we put this into place?&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lim, as you know,&nbsp;is the Chairman of the National Wages Council and Bioethics Committee.&nbsp; So he is experienced in handling complex issues.&nbsp; When I asked him if he would&nbsp;chair this Committee, he joked that he was old enough.&nbsp; Professor Lim Pin is not old but gold (good and old) - experienced and still actively contributing and working.&nbsp; He understands the needs of the elderly and is the right man for the job.&nbsp; But I have asked that the report be ready within six months.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given them enough time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opening remarks, I asked that we keep in focus the ultimate goal of these&nbsp;changes:&nbsp;why are we doing all this?&nbsp; It is to put in place a better and sustainable CPF system.&nbsp; Our CPF system is unique.&nbsp; A strong and fully-funded CPF system has been a major pillar and will continue to be a major pillar of our nation's economic prosperity and social progress.&nbsp; Through CPF savings - just think about it, what our CPF system does - nearly 90% of Singaporeans are able to own their homes&nbsp;- one of the highest home-ownership rates in the world.&nbsp; Because of the three Ms - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund - no Singaporean is denied good basic medical care.&nbsp; Homes and CPF savings<p align=left>Column: 1549<p> together provide retirement security for the majority in their old age,&nbsp;even for low income households.&nbsp; These are&nbsp;major accomplishments for any country, and something that we can be proud of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes we are making will strengthen the CPF system further.&nbsp; Longevity insurance is the missing critical piece that we are&nbsp;now putting into place.&nbsp; It answers the question which this resident asked:&nbsp; \"What happens when my CPF savings run out?\"&nbsp; It plugs a gap in our CPF system and will give security for the many Singaporeans who are expected to live very long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF system has helped Singaporeans achieve social and economic security and equity because it is based on individual savings, not taxes.&nbsp; This is a critical principle underlying our CPF system and it explains its strength.&nbsp; It is fair to all because each person saves for his own needs, including for his own future needs in old age.&nbsp; We must be careful, stringent, to adhere to this principle.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even with these comprehensive changes, not all problems will be solved.&nbsp; The disabled and poor or those who meet unexpected mishaps or misfortunes will continue to need assistance.&nbsp; But if able Singaporeans have made provision for their own needs, then Government can provide more resources to help those who deserve it most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never shied away from problems that can affect our nation's future, no matter how big or difficult.&nbsp; Singapore is one of the very few countries tackling this problem head-on, with eyes wide-open and the public engaged.&nbsp; The problem of retirement adequacy is a looming challenge for many countries.&nbsp; Most countries know that they are ill-prepared for their ageing populations.&nbsp; But<p align=left>Column: 1550<p> not all have been able to act to avoid the impending crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some countries have debated a long time, but have not moved.&nbsp; Reform commissions, one after another,&nbsp;such as those in France, Ireland and the United States, spell out the changes that need to be made.&nbsp; The Irish commission failed to agree on a conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even China admits that it needs to move faster as the problem is growing.&nbsp; In Italy, pension reform has been a major stumbling block for successive governments even after 20 years of deliberations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group of countries postpone the solution to the next generation.&nbsp; In the case of the United Kingdom, their state pension age is already at 65 for men, and between 60 and 65 for women.&nbsp; So they have actually moved faster&nbsp;than us.&nbsp; The UK now intends to move the new pension age to 68 for both men and women.&nbsp; I think it is laudable, but they want to reach there only by 2046, nearly 40 years in the future!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore cannot afford to wait another 40 years to tackle this problem.&nbsp; We should not pass these problems of an ageing population to the next generation, because it&nbsp;will only get worse.&nbsp; Far better to make adjustments now, while we are able and have time on our side.&nbsp; If we wait and are ill-prepared, then the consequences for Singaporeans when they are old and dependent will indeed be more painful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should work together now, move decisively, and turn these reforms to our advantage.&nbsp; With higher CPF interest, all CPF members will be better off, especially the lower and middle income groups.&nbsp; Everyone will have more savings for retirement.&nbsp; Working longer, later draw-down, deferment bonuses and longevity protection will ensure that as many as possible will have savings for as long as they live.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1551<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes will strengthen our CPF system. &nbsp;It will improve retirement security and help Singaporeans face the future with greater confidence.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the Ministerial Statement on the CPF Reforms and Other Measures for a Secure Retirement be considered by Parliament.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Question proposed.</p><!--MP_NAME:Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah)--></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, the last few months have seen the nation abuzz with discussions on the CPF and retirement issues. As we grapple with challenges, like widening income gap, greater life expectancy and an ageing society, steps need to be taken to ensure that Singaporeans have enough savings for their retirement needs.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Malays have a saying, \"<I>sebelum hujan sediakan payung</I>\",&nbsp;which literally translates to \"getting an umbrella ready before it rains\".&nbsp; Sir, the measures just announced by the Minister in his Statement form part of that umbrella that Singaporeans need to see them through retirement. On sunny days, one may grumble that carrying an umbrella is a hassle.&nbsp; But in a tropical climate like Singapore's, rain can come at any time of the day, all year round. The sooner we<p align=left>Column: 1552<p> start planning and preparing for it, the better.&nbsp; It is critical that we each have a big and sturdy \"umbrella\" because, if not, Singaporeans may be caught at a time when they are at their most vulnerable, ie, in old age.&nbsp; Some of these changes may not be popular but I wholeheartedly agree that they are necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore like to congratulate the Minister and his team for a sterling job in coming out with the three pillars to support Singaporeans' retirement needs.&nbsp; The Government is also clearly generous in dishing&nbsp;out the D- and V-Bonuses which together amount to a whopping $2.3 billion. This is no mean feat as there are not many countries out there that could do or deliver this. The changes to the CPF system is a recurring $1.1 billion each year.&nbsp; To this, I would like to ask the Minister whether this is really sustainable in the longer term or will there be cut-backs in difficult years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have some&nbsp;concerns to raise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first pillar involves increasing the retirement age for workers. Currently, only 53.7% of Singaporeans aged 55 to 64 are working. As announced, the Government will make it mandatory for all employers to offer re-employment to their workers after they reach 62 in 2012.&nbsp; Sir, to accomplish this smoothly, mindset changes -&nbsp;both on the part of the employers and employees - must be addressed from now.&nbsp; Employers must feel that they benefit or at least do not lose out by retaining the older workers.&nbsp; They must understand that older workers may generally bring with them strong work ethics but they, ie, the employees, for example, may prefer face-to-face communication as compared to jobs which require electronic modes of communication. Perhaps, training courses could be held for employers on job redesigning for older workers so that they can come up with a job matching exercise that takes into consideration the needs of<p align=left>Column: 1553<p> the company and also the ability and interest of the older worker in the new post. Workers too must be pragmatic in being prepared to take up&nbsp;a lower salary or take on a different role.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guidelines by the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers should be such that they are fair to both parties and that they feel motivated to extend the relationship they have built over the years.&nbsp; It should also consider a way out for employers whose business may be genuinely affected from a downturn by allowing them to turn to a third party for placement&nbsp;in another company.&nbsp; In other words, the onus of responsibility should lie on the employer to seek a suitable job match for an employee who is still willing to continue employment past the age of 62.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I support the initiatives announced under the second pillar - on increasing CPF returns -&nbsp;I feel that the needs of some sectors of the community, such as the under-employed, are not sufficiently addressed.&nbsp; One sizeable group would be housewives or women who are involved in informal or ad-hoc jobs.&nbsp; They might have very little or no CPF to take care of their needs in old age.&nbsp; If their husbands are holding low income jobs, there would not be enough in his CPF to cover for his wife's retirement needs.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Government to look at this issue seriously and explore ways and means to assist housewives.&nbsp; One measure that could be considered is to extend an \"M\" (or Mother) bonus in the CPF accounts of mothers who are working part-time.&nbsp; This will also encourage more women to join the workforce and pave the way for contributions to be made to their CPF savings but still leaving them with sufficient time to tend to their children and household chores.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1554<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another group of concern is low-income Singaporeans who do not have sufficient savings in their CPF accounts to meet the Minimum Sum requirements.&nbsp; Sir, while the 1% increase in the OA and SMRA CPF interest rates will&nbsp;quite substantially, as the Minister explained, contribute to the increase in Singaporeans' retirement savings, this may still be inadequate for low-income families to build on their retirement savings.&nbsp; I would like to propose that the Government consider lowering the HDB's concessionary loan interest rate, specifically for three-room flat buyers, as such applicants are likely to be low-income families. The savings that they earn from the lower interest rate should then be transferred to their Special Account, which will in turn help them accumulate for retirement use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The topic on annuities or longevity insurance has generated quite a bit of debate on the ground.&nbsp; A key point of contention with the majority is the fact that, if made compulsory, they would rather have their principal contributions protected and the balance returned to their beneficiaries should they not live beyond 85 years old.&nbsp; It is still a question of the premium to be paid and special riders could be considered for those keen in protecting their capital.&nbsp; Another possibility is to consider extending the CPF monthly withdrawal period to beyond 20 years, recognising that the monthly payouts will be smaller.&nbsp; There are also suggestions of having the longevity insurance as an opt-in scheme.&nbsp; However, I feel this puts us&nbsp;in a catch-22 situation.&nbsp; If not many people take up annuities, the pool will be smaller and the returns correspondingly lower.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, some residents have told me that the prospect of having to work till they are 65 or 67 is a sombering reality.&nbsp; The figures given by the Department of Statistics support this need for people to <p align=left>Column: 1555<p>work longer, but there is a grey cloud hanging over the workers' heads as they feel that they are in a society where one has to work to the grave. We have to educate Singaporeans on the harsh reality they may face that if they retire at 62 and do not have enough savings, they will face great difficulties.&nbsp; Apart from financial considerations, keeping the elderly in the workforce beyond the age of 62 can bring other benefits.&nbsp; When a healthy elderly person works or is constantly engaged in activity, he is kept physically and mentally active and this can prevent elderly ageing ills.&nbsp; Some retirees I have met told me that they only enjoyed the first few years of not working after retirement, and after that they became restless and felt that they were wasting away and, hence, needed to engage themselves in part-time jobs or community work.&nbsp;&nbsp; This reminds me of a quote by a poet, Richard Armour&nbsp;who said, and I quote, \"Retired is being tired twice, I've thought:&nbsp;&nbsp;first tired of working, and then, tired of not\".&nbsp; I feel that the Government should provide more education and statistics to the public so that they understand the issues surrounding retirement, and the needs and challenges longevity brings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While all these measures&nbsp;are deliberated, Sir, I would like to take a step back and look at what needs to be done to prepare the younger generation of Singaporeans for such challenges, which may be even tougher when the time comes for them to retire.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I worry that they are already starting to become a part of a \"plastic money\" generation where the culture of spending is ingrained in them even before they start working.&nbsp; The $500 credit cards offered to students by banks is one example of this. This is in stark contrast to the savings campaign in the 1980s where POSB's squirrel mascot was often seen encouraging children to save for a rainy day.&nbsp; I would say, bring back the squirrel <p align=left>Column: 1556<p>to educate students and youths on the importance of starting to save for old age at a very early stage of their lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to stress to Singaporeans that CPF savings alone may not be enough to see them through their old age. Beyond the measures taken by the Government, every individual has to practise financial prudence from the early years of his working life, and ensures that he leads a healthy lifestyle so that he is able to work and support himself for as long as it is possible and necessary to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to now say a few words in Malay.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<I>In</I> <I>Malay</I>):&nbsp; [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070917/20070917VS_113851.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a> *.</I> ]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, I hope that the local Malay community has followed the discussion and the changes that have been announced with regard to retirement needs.&nbsp; These changes are very crucial and have to be understood by every adult, especially those who are approaching their sunset years.&nbsp; It involves important changes in their way of thinking with regard to retirement.&nbsp; In the past, retirement was deemed as a time when one could&nbsp;stop working - rest, stay at home and shake legs, look after grandchildren, etc.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1657-1660.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, the meaning of retirement has changed. Due to increasing cost of living, the increasing number of older citizens and advancement in medical science, as well as the quality of life which enables one to live longer, someone who retires at the age of 62 years old might not be able to enjoy a comfortable life after retirement, especially those with little savings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This trend does not only occur in Singapore but it is happening all over the world. The difference is whether or not the government of a country is quick to react before something terrible happens. The Singapore Government chose to react early by introducing several changes to <p align=left>Column: 1557<p>ensure that the people's interests during retirement are being taken care of.</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statistics show that 53.7% of Singaporeans between the age of 55 and 64 years old&nbsp; are still working.&nbsp; I am not sure what is the statistic for the Malay community. Maybe, the Ministry of Manpower can provide this statistic and if it is very much lower than the national average, something has to be done immediately.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the society has to realise the importance of continuing to work after the age of 62. The virtue of working hard to support oneself is an act of fulfilling the religious order which is also encouraged in Islam.&nbsp; Therefore, even if one is being offered a different role or a lower pay after retirement, such opportunities must be seized because it will help one to be self-reliant during his old age.&nbsp; The same goes with lifelong learning.&nbsp; If an employer organises self-improvement courses or courses to gain knowledge in other fields, an employee has to seize this opportunity as this will boost his self-confidence and enhance his working abilities.&nbsp; Employees have to ensure that the skills that they have are in line with the needs of the economy, even during their sunset years.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the bigger concern is on the lower income earners who are unable to accumulate&nbsp; sufficient Minimum Sum in their CPF accounts.&nbsp; What should be done? The move made by Government to increase the interest rate for a portion of the CPF savings will increase the amount of savings that they have, but this is insufficient.&nbsp; Lower income earners should be prudent when using their CPF savings for housing so that they do not overspend. They should be taught to manage finances, spend thriftily and effectively and they should try to have their own personal savings, because this will also help them in the long run.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1558<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public education on the annuity scheme should also be carried out for the Malay community.&nbsp; I am sure&nbsp;that the scheme that will be introduced at the national level has not been fully understood by many.&nbsp; The scheme, which is to ensure that senior citizens who are 85 years old and above should at least have some money each month and not be in distress, should be explained in greater depth.&nbsp; It is important as statistics show that more Singaporeans are living beyond 85 years old. In Malaysia, there is Takaful Annuity Scheme which is offered under the Islamic banking system based on the concept of <I>Al-Mudharabah</I> or profit-sharing. Perhaps, now is the time for banks in Singapore&nbsp; which offer Islamic banking to study whether such schemes should be introduced. This annuity scheme is still at the deliberation level and I hope that the community will follow its development in the mass media and direct their enquiries, if any.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in conclusion, what is important is that our community should continue to show our spirit of self-reliance and self-worth during our sunset years. This can be achieved by taking care of personal health, being thrifty when spending and cautious when making investments using their savings. These measures will ensure that our community will not live in distress or have to seek charity from others during our sunset years. In facing this challenge and for the interest of the future, the community should act now.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Seng Han Thong (Yio Chu Kang)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>): [<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070917/20070917VS_121011.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.]&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, with an ageing population, the Government proposes to defer retirement age, to delay the withdrawal of CPF and implement a compulsory annuity scheme.&nbsp; However, a minority of people object to<p align=left>Column: 1559<p> that.&nbsp; They say that they do not want the Government to delay their withdrawal age, and they think that the Government does not know how to manage it.&nbsp; I hope that a few years after implementation, we can roll out this programme.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 1661-1664.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we must be careful about three things.&nbsp; First of all, Singaporeans have a deep mindset, because they think that it is quite rare for the people to live until 70 years old.&nbsp; Secondly, we must tell the people that if they want to work, there are some jobs for them.&nbsp; Thirdly, longevity insurance is a new concept.&nbsp; We have to help them, to make it very simple and easy for them to understand.&nbsp; Let me elaborate further .&nbsp; If we ask them how old will they be, a lot of people think that they cannot live beyond 85.&nbsp; Every morning, my mother reads the obituary column of the newspaper wanting to know whether people have passed away after 85 years old.&nbsp; In fact, some have passed away at 92 years old.&nbsp; So the old people need that kind of guarantee that they can live beyond 90 years old.&nbsp; Therefore, I believe that some people, like my mother, will always read the obituary section of the newspaper every morning to check the age of those who have passed away.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, a lot of people can live beyond 92 years old.&nbsp; Yesterday was the birthday of Minister Mentor Lee.&nbsp; He is already 85 years old, and we wish him long life and good health, and prosperity for the nation.&nbsp; From the example of Minister Mentor Lee, we can see that he always travels to other countries and he gives talks, and he is a very good example.&nbsp; People say, \"I am not MM Lee.&nbsp; He is a big shot.&nbsp; We are just insignificant people.\"&nbsp; And they want some ordinary example to be told.&nbsp; For example, every morning when we start running, in Hokkien, they say, \"We know how to walk, how to run.&nbsp; We can plant grass and flowers.&nbsp; Then we can enjoy good health and live to 99 years old.\"&nbsp; So we add something, and we can live to 99 <p align=left>Column: 1560<p>years old because we can still play computer games by using the PC.&nbsp; However, a lot of people think that this cannot happen to them.&nbsp; In the Chinese society, we treat it as a taboo subject to mention about death.&nbsp; Therefore, how to transmit this message to all the Singaporeans is important.&nbsp; If a lot of people accept this fact that they can live to an old age, first of all, we have to assure them that they can work until an old age, and there are plenty of jobs for them.&nbsp; Therefore, we have to redesign the jobs for them.&nbsp; We need to redesign and restructure the work for the elderly people.&nbsp; In the past two years, we have worked with NTUC, SNEF and WDA and achieved encouraging results. Over the past 18 months, we have more than 300 companies who responded to our call.&nbsp; Over 3,000 people at 60 years have a job.&nbsp; On what kind of jobs, they say it is simple jobs but there are some elderly people who get good jobs.&nbsp; The elderly people say that they need suitable jobs with a deserving pay.&nbsp; So if they accept this, they will think that the delay in the CPF withdrawal age is feasible.&nbsp; On this, I think we need to work harder to help the elderly workers.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, last week, there was a <I>Zaobao</I> report dated 4th September 2007 which states that in Japan, 70% of the people are worried about their retirement age.&nbsp; 70% of the people feel that the government should restructure the welfare system.&nbsp; More than 50% of the population feel that the government should address the ageing population problem in Japan.&nbsp; So, our Government is making a daring approach to roll out this programme and I believe that we will be able to achieve successful results.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, our survey is pretty worrisome.&nbsp; Recently, the <I>Straits Times</I> carried out a survey: 7 out of 10 people think that they do not have enough CPF savings for retirement.&nbsp; About half of them think that they can still take care of themselves, but it seems to be contradictory.&nbsp; If they<p align=left>Column: 1561<p> do not have money, how can they look after themselves after their retirement age?&nbsp; So we must assure them that people can live a long healthy life, they can have a job to work on and, lastly, they can defer the CPF draw-down age.&nbsp; Government will provide support to everybody to ensure that Singaporeans obtain better returns on their CPF.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

May I ask: is this sustainable?&nbsp; Is this guaranteed?&nbsp; I am happy to note that it will benefit more&nbsp;the lower and middle income workers.&nbsp; It will also create a more secure retirement for all Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Minister, in his speech, also mentioned that workers who choose to work longer will benefit more, and he gave examples.&nbsp; But the concern of many older workers is whether they can find a decent job after 62.&nbsp; Of course, the re-employment of older workers is very important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NTUC has worked with many companies and there are some early successes with either same job same pay, same job different pay, different job same pay or different job different pay.&nbsp; We need to see a widespread adoption of re-employment.&nbsp; There are statistics but we have to let people understand that they have to accept this reality.&nbsp; We need to see a widespread adoption of re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; There is an expectation on the ground now that re-employment should happen prior to the legislation in year 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On longevity insurance, flexibility should be the key to&nbsp;policy formulation.&nbsp; And for many, 85 is really a long, long way to go.&nbsp; We must appreciate that many just do not believe that they can live that long, and that they can work <p align=left>Column: 1562<p>beyond 62.&nbsp; We are an Asian society, talking about death after 85 is a very <I>pantang</I> issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The longevity issue is a new concept and it needs time to sell to the people.&nbsp; The feedback from our union leaders is that we need to provide only the basic coverage under the mandatory longevity insurance, so as to keep the premium as low as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;We should allow for more options, such as 25 years of draw-down period or even longer for those who want to reduce the need for longevity insurance, and CPF is to provide the basic longevity insurance package to minimise cost.&nbsp; Of course, those who are medically certified as terminally ill may be exempted from buying the annuity plan or longevity insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Minister has promised that it will be quite basic, affordable and flexible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first&nbsp;20 years of our life is like spring where we grow and learn. The second&nbsp;20 years is like summer where we work and progress towards our peak. The third stage is like autumn where we have reached our peak, start to slow down but continue to accumulate and collect our harvest to prepare ourselves for the last stage,&nbsp;winter. If we prepare ourselves well and make hay while the sun shines, then we can have a comfortable winter with enough food and warmth. If not, we will starve and face the cold.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1665-1666.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the longer life expectancy, Singaporeans can expect some changes in <p align=left>Column: 1563<p>these four seasons. We should rejoice with the longer life expectancy that we are enjoying, but it also means that many will face a longer winter. We need to accumulate more and earlier to prepare ourselves for the longer winter.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To increase the retirement age, increase CPF returns by increasing the interest and delaying the draw-down age for the CPF Minimum Sum are all necessary, timely and farsighted measures. These measures will help many Singaporeans in their golden years. I support these measures. However, there will be some Singaporeans&nbsp;who may fall between the cracks. As mentioned by PM in his National Day Rally speech, only one-third of male employees, and much less than that for female employees, actually retire at the current retirement age of 62 years. In the near future, when the retirement age is raised to 67 years old, can we be sure that Singaporeans who are healthy and want to work can find employment? &nbsp;I am sure the Government cannot guarantee that especially in times of an economic downturn.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delaying the Minimum Sum withdrawal age from 62 to 65 may bring hardship to those who are unable to find employment or, for medical reasons, are unable to work. They may be left completely without regular income from 62 to 65 years old.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this group, I hope the Ministry of Manpower can introduce more flexibility in this policy to allow them to start drawing down at 62 years but at a lower quantum. In this way, they can have some regular income during the interim years and also enjoy payouts till 85 years old.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(<I>In English</I>):&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Increase in CPF OA interest rate and peg CPF SMRA to long-term bonds rate</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I welcome the increase of interest rate for the first $60,000 in the CPF to help all<p align=left>Column: 1564<p> Singaporeans grow a larger retirement reserve. I hope the Government can continue to keep the minimum 4% interest rate for at least the first $60,000 in the Special, Retirement and Medisave accounts for longer than two years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poor and, in fact, most of the middle class will be using most, if not, all of their savings in the Ordinary Account for housing needs. Hence, the move to help them to accumulate more by increasing the interest rate by 1% for the Ordinary Account may be good but, unfortunately, may not work well for them. If the interest rate for the Special, Retirement and Medisave accounts were to decrease due to the decrease in the long-term bond yields to below 3%, the poor and the middle class will suffer as most of their savings will be there. I hope MOM can extend the minimum 4% guarantee base rate for the SMR accounts for a longer period.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Compulsory annuity/longevity insurance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The compulsory longevity insurance represents a paradigm shift in our management of retirement funding. The scheme requires all Singaporeans to pool part of their savings together to mitigate the risk of living beyond their savings. It is like a term insurance whereby if nothing happens, you get nothing from the premium paid. But there will be a large payout in the event of an occurrence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If this scheme, unlike MediShield, is going to be a compulsory scheme, how is the Government going to include those who have little or no CPF to pay for the premium? If the scheme is considered to be so critical and so important to be made compulsory, such as the compulsory primary school education for our children, the Government should consider co-funding the scheme with the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also many who question who will stand to gain from such a scheme. It <p align=left>Column: 1565<p>is intuitive to many that the wealthy who can afford higher standard of care and medical services may have longer life expectancy than the middle and lower socio-economic groups. Will the wealthy stand to gain more if they have a longer lifespan? Or will the middle sandwich class, who may have the highest stress, be the ones to lose out in the long run with a shorter lifespan? Are there any studies to allay the fears of the public to dismiss these assumptions?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although 50% of those who live to 62 years will live to and beyond 85 years, how many will die at 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 years? How long must they live to at least equalise the premium paid 23 years ago? 89 or 90? What percentage will stand to take back more than they paid?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How about the group that does not have any CPF or too little CPF to purchase the premium? They are the home-makers, odd job labourers and some self-employed. Will there be schemes to assist them? If not, how can the scheme be compulsory?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to learn that the Government is prepared to allow for some to opt out. These are those with expected limited life expectancy and those who already have sufficient provisions for their retirement. For the latter group, I hope it will include civil servants who are already on the pension scheme. I hope that the Government can also consider opt-out schemes for those who have too little to spare in their CPF accounts. If a person has a Minimum Sum accumulated of only $12,000, requiring him or her to pay $6,000 for the premium does not make sense at all. They will need all the money upfront, rather than to delay for another 23 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans should not depend on this scheme as their sole and only retirement funding. But I hope the monthly<p align=left>Column: 1566<p> payout should be enough to sustain their basic livelihood, just like our Public Assistance (PA) scheme. Even at our low inflation rate of 1%, in another 35 years, the monthly payout amount will be much less than what it is today. It will be good if the Government can peg the longevity insurance payouts to our PA scheme to ensure basic sustenance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, I like to commend the Government for making bold reforms to our CPF system to be ahead of anticipated changes. My last concern is - what is the actual fiscal impact on the budget of this and subsequent Governments? Will the Government need to raise further taxes, such as GST, in the near future to fund all these changes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister can answer some of the questions. With that, I support the proposed CPF changes.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Cham Hui Fong (Nominated Member):</B> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the National Day Rally speech by PM, there have been a lot of discussions on how old are we going to live.&nbsp; Do I belong to the first medium half of the 85 or do I belong to the second?&nbsp; No one knows. But I think what is in the minds of many is that a lot of us&nbsp;are indeed going to live that long.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"center\"><B>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Matthias Yao Chih) in the Chair]</B></p><p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among some of the key changes mentioned by PM, the re-employment law, the raising of the Minimum Sum draw-down age, the longevity insurance (a lot of them call that as a tax that you have to pay for living so long) were very much discussed among our workers.&nbsp; But the key question that lies in many of us is still: will&nbsp;there be jobs for me?&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth and the employment figures for the first half appear to be good.&nbsp; I think the Manpower Ministry has also estimated that we can expect<p align=left>Column: 1567<p> another 90,000 jobs per year over the next five years.&nbsp; But, of course, MTI has also raised the estimate from 3%-5% to 4%-6% over the next five years.&nbsp; So, I think prospects over the next few years appear to be good.&nbsp; Now that more jobs&nbsp;will and have been created, what we should do is to really leverage on our own resources, which are the older workers and the female workforce.<br> &nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last 20 months, NTUC has been working together with the unions and the tripartite partners to see how we can move this re-employment issue.&nbsp; We have knocked on the doors of the employers to explore ways and look at the different practices, what are best practices that will make the scheme work for the different companies and&nbsp;industries. Today, there are probably better buy-ins from the employers.&nbsp; We have about 315 companies committed to work out some form of re-employment together with the unions.&nbsp; Out of these 315 companies, 216 companies are already re-employing close to 3,200 workers today.&nbsp; But there are some employers who still tell us that&nbsp;they do not have to do anything today, and they will probably wait for the guidelines as it will be clearer.&nbsp; Wait for the guidelines, wait for the law to be passed; it will be easier because they do not have to justify to HQ why they are doing this when the retirement age is still 62.&nbsp; So, we asked them: how could it be easier when the period of five years is really for us to look at what more we can do, what are the changes that will take place?&nbsp; Because we probably need to redesign the jobs,&nbsp;look at the structure, whether the structure is competitive, because we do not want the employers to come back&nbsp;to tell us that our older workers are too expensive, and&nbsp;they do not want to re-employ them.&nbsp; And we probably also have to look at whether these people possess the right skills, the right training, and whether there are any skill gaps that we need to adjust.&nbsp; And we have to adjust quickly and not when they reach 62.&nbsp; So <p align=left>Column: 1568<p>we have to look at the entire workforce and see what more we have to do to prepare the workers.&nbsp; Our leaders and workers are fully aware that whatever changes that were announced underscore the need that there must be job opportunities for the workers. So the next five years will give us ample time to work out different models.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to share some of the learning points that we have from working with some of these companies.&nbsp; About 70% of our workforce who are currently re-employed are doing the same job but at a slightly lower pay to adjust for the relatively lower responsibilities.&nbsp; Companies like the Singapore Food Industries, Singapore Airlines Engineering Company, for example, re-employ their workers when they reach 62.&nbsp; Some slight adjustments were made to the pay to better reflect the value of the job.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Singapore Food Industries where we visited last week, more than 50% of the workers are above 50 years old and about 29 of them are more than 62 years old.&nbsp; We asked the management and the management told us that even though they have a relatively older workforce, they are very happy with them because they possess the right values in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another observation we have in the Singapore Food Industries is the management's emphasis on training and counselling, not just counselling of the workers.&nbsp; They counsel the younger managers and the supervisors to let them understand that these older workers form an integral part of the value chain.&nbsp; You have to respect them, you have to understand their psychology, you have to be able to deal with them, and the workers are well aware of this emphasis, and the older workers feel very good.&nbsp; They feel that there is this sense of pride, dignity and worth, that the management actually places a lot of emphasis on them and ensures that these teams - the young and the old - can work together <p align=left>Column: 1569<p>cohesively.&nbsp; As a result of this good understanding that is in this culture of the organisation, about 90% of each cohort reaching 62 were actually re-employed over the last couple of years.&nbsp; Another 20%, or about one in five of our workers, were re-employed,&nbsp;doing the same job and drawing the same pay.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Raffles Hotel re-employed about 14 employees over the last three to four years. They pay them the same because they believe that as long as the person possesses the right&nbsp;and positive attitude, is still fit for the job and is able to perform the same job, the person should be given the opportunity to continue working.&nbsp; They offer them options, like flexible hours, part-time work, if they desire to spend a bit more time with their families.&nbsp; But we were told that a lot of them chose to work as&nbsp;permanent staff and&nbsp;for the normal hours that they were given.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, our two healthcare clusters (SingHealth and NHG) re-employ more than 250 employees today who are more than 62.&nbsp; What the management values is really very much these intrinsic values that these senior employees have with them.&nbsp; Furthermore, I think what is important to note in these companies is that their wages are very competitive with a minimum-maximum ratio of about 1:5.&nbsp; So they could afford to actually re-employ them, continue at the same rate, on the same job.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases, the management believes that the workers should be paid according to their capability to do the job and not just because they have turned&nbsp;62.&nbsp; A person does not become more expensive just because he has turned 62.&nbsp; This draws me to the next area of concern which is something that we have been talking about for many years, which is the wage structure.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1570<p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employers are concerned about the wage cost of the older workers.&nbsp; Like it or not, we are still very much seniority-based, even though over the years we have made some improvements over the salary structure.&nbsp; When we visited Japan last year, there was one company Jellco - they call themselves a SME but they have 2,000 workers.&nbsp; They have an interesting philosophy, which is people can grow and improve their skills by continuously working.&nbsp; So, this is one of the very few companies in Japan that opted for one of the three options provided by the law, which is they abolished the retirement age totally.&nbsp; So we asked them: how do you manage to do that?&nbsp; They did a serious and&nbsp;very comprehensive revamp of their wage structure.&nbsp; Job grades were actually reassigned to reflect the value of the job. They look at the amount of competency, the amount of ability that is needed, and then they reassess.&nbsp; It was a very painful and&nbsp;difficult process for the workers to accept.&nbsp; They&nbsp;developed and introduced it in 2001.&nbsp; We understand that as long as your job ability does not change, your wage level remains unchanged.&nbsp; But as far as the company is concerned, it will pay you according to your job.&nbsp; So it does not matter whether you are 35 or 45,&nbsp;they&nbsp;will continue to pay you.&nbsp; So, to the management, working is learning.&nbsp; If you have a retirement age, it will affect both the mindsets of the employers and employees.&nbsp; It is sad to hear that if one knows that when he is retiring, his career is going to end, his attitude will change.&nbsp; So&nbsp;it did&nbsp;away with the retirement age totally so that there is no end point.&nbsp; You just continue learning, continue working.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in Singapore, so far, we have heard of two cases - Canon Singapore and Seiko Instruments.&nbsp; They have also taken the initiative to restructure the wages, very similar to the ones in Japan. They did a total revamp, they actually reviewed the salary, and they have new job grades to reflect the value of the job.<p align=left>Column: 1571<p> As far as they are concerned, again, it does not matter.&nbsp; It is very much age-neutral, whether you are 35 or 55,&nbsp;they will pay you according to the job.</p><p align=\"left\"></p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought it is necessary for us to review the salary structure again and again because we have to move away to reduce the anxiety.&nbsp; Today, if we have a more structured wage system in place,&nbsp;reflecting the value of the job, I think we will be able to address a lot of concerns of the workers, which is&nbsp;the anxiety&nbsp;as in how much wage cut am I expected to get when I hit 62.&nbsp; Because, today, a lot of employers, before even looking at what kind of new jobs&nbsp;they are&nbsp;going to offer to you, they are talking about how much&nbsp;cut&nbsp;you&nbsp;can accept.&nbsp; So, we should actually do away with all this and really look at the value of the job,&nbsp;look at what are the new job opportunities there are to be given to the workers.&nbsp; Employability training is also another key&nbsp;element to ensure&nbsp;success in re-employment, and&nbsp;this is what a lot of our leaders have said. They said they need to be&nbsp;assured that they are kept on the job, they are given the right skills and&nbsp;right training to make sure that they can stay on.&nbsp; Because when we talk about re-employment, it need not be the same job or the same pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this is something that&nbsp;they&nbsp;can accept.&nbsp; But&nbsp;to be fair to them, they&nbsp;have to be given ample time to be trained and also take on new responsibilities before they can transit smoothly to a new job.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In PUB, the management values the workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements were made to counsel, inform and prepare the workers to take on new jobs.&nbsp; We have seen technicians who have been technicians&nbsp;for the past many years and at the age of 58, 59, they talked to them, counselled them and allowed them to take on new challenges because there were actually new opportunities.&nbsp; So these guys went for training and&nbsp;got themselves familiarised with the new jobs, have a&nbsp;fair <p align=left>Column: 1572<p>understanding of what these new jobs entail, and they move on to do something else.&nbsp; They are now called water catchment surveillance officers.&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of SBS, they have done likewise as well. They talk to their senior operators, those who are going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;retired, offer them new jobs as service mentors.&nbsp; The jobs require them to coach and guide the new operators upon retirement.&nbsp; In both cases, the company works with the&nbsp;workers, explores new grounds, trains them and sees them through the new jobs.</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we need time to work on that because we cannot create new jobs overnight.&nbsp; Some of these companies - ISK Singapore, the company that produces titanium dioxide (it is a Japanese company), Sanofi-aventis, a pharmaceutical company, Singapore Food Industries -&nbsp;they know that time is needed to actually prepare the workers in the event that there ought to be job switches,&nbsp;even though&nbsp;the workers are not going to switch jobs.&nbsp; I think we need to talk to them to&nbsp;prepare them, to make them financially aware of&nbsp;what are they in for, whether they should continue working.&nbsp; So they&nbsp;have worked with the unions over the years to introduce pre-retirement counselling and discussions with workers&nbsp;before they reach retirement age.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;case of Sanofi-aventis where technology changes very quickly&nbsp;-&nbsp;it is a pharmaceutical company&nbsp;- they set aside five years to prepare the workers and the&nbsp;management for job&nbsp;opportunities after 62.&nbsp; In the case of Sanofi, there is a possibility that the workers may have to take on new jobs even&nbsp;before 62, and that is something we have been conveying to the workers - have this positive mindset that you even need to change your job before 62, to ensure&nbsp;you can continue working beyond that.&nbsp; Because we understand that there have to be sufficient&nbsp;learning and&nbsp;training before opportunities can be given to you.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t<p align=left>Column: 1573<p>\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So it is also important that we communicate the expectations or the criteria of re-employment early to our workers.&nbsp;In a lot of these cases, we see satisfactory work performance, medically fit for the job, as&nbsp;the common criteria used by the companies. Fair enough.&nbsp; If these are going to be the criteria, let us be clear to the workers and&nbsp;let the workers know what to expect so that the unions and the management can work together during this period to assist them.&nbsp; If there is any performance gap&nbsp;or skills gap,&nbsp;we have ample time to actually look at that early, detect that, put in the corrective measures and ensure that these people can move on&nbsp;because we want to avoid unnecessary conflicts, whether it is now or&nbsp;2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of our committed companies share similar concerns and have taken a serious approach to all these.&nbsp; They know fairly well that there will be fewer younger people to employ relative to the older ones and they do not want to lose the skills,&nbsp;values and&nbsp;knowledge of the older workers that have actually accumulated with them over the years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, we have to look at the workplace environment.&nbsp; Some works that require a lot of physical mobility and strength may not be too suitable for the older workers.&nbsp; In the case of Bukit Timah Saddle Club -&nbsp;it is a big organisation with a small workforce -&nbsp;workers are expected to remove bulky soiled sawdust, hays and feeds to and from the stable, storage area and dumping grounds.&nbsp; Their work area is as big as 4.5 hectares of land, which previously they were doing manually,&nbsp;by removing all this and&nbsp;they used push carts and trolleys.&nbsp; It is something very tiring for the workers.&nbsp; They have a total of 32 workers, one out of five is more than 55 years old and, today, there are about four who are 62 years and above.&nbsp; The management is keen to keep <p align=left>Column: 1574<p>the workers.&nbsp; So they have worked with the unions to review the entire work processes and&nbsp;to see how they could make it easier for the older workers to cope, if they were to work longer.&nbsp; They have recently got the approval of ADVANTAGE! funding to purchase tractors.&nbsp; It is a simple technology&nbsp;-&nbsp;they buy tractors;&nbsp;they also buy 25 dump bins. The dump bins can be attached to the tractors so that when they move around to collect the hays and feeds, they can also dump whatever waste into the dump bins and actually bring them back to the dump sites&nbsp;-&nbsp;but workers have to be trained with the process.&nbsp; And in this case,&nbsp;it not only helps the workers by&nbsp;making it easier for them, but also improves the productivity of the workers.&nbsp; So it is a clear case of approach that is pro-business and also pro-worker, and it helps in both&nbsp;cases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been talking&nbsp;to our companies that job redesign&nbsp;need not be a very&nbsp;complicated one because a lot of time when we talk about job redesign, there is always this anxiety.&nbsp; How difficult is it?&nbsp; How much time have I&nbsp;got to devote to actually look into all this?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have the commitment and conviction to it, all forms of job redesign can make it. And I think a lot of time, you still have to go through a lot of trial-and-error.&nbsp; No one knows what is the best scheme.&nbsp; But we must be prepared to put in some efforts to actually try it out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that there will continue to be many challenges ahead.&nbsp; We have set a national target of 65% employment rate for those who are 55 to 64 in the next five to eight years.&nbsp; We honestly do not think&nbsp;it is good enough to set the target&nbsp;in five to eight years' time.&nbsp; What we need to see is that we have to set check points every year.&nbsp; I think every year, we should have some indicators whether our re-employment is working.&nbsp; Because if re-employment is not going to work, then whatever draw-down age we are going to <p align=left>Column: 1575<p>have is not going to make it very well&nbsp;because the people do not even have sufficient money during the period&nbsp;and having a draw-down age much later is going to be even more painful to the workers.&nbsp;If it is not progressing, then new strategies must be put in place earlier when we review the targets.&nbsp; Those who are 58 and&nbsp;59 today would also like to be gainfully employed beyond 62 as well.&nbsp; So it is crucial for us to see more results in the next few years, in fact, the next two years.&nbsp; As far as possible, even before the tripartite guideline is ready in two years' time, we have to ensure that we have more companies that come on board to put on re-employment practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So the Manpower Ministry's support will certainly be crucial to take on and counsel employers who find ways not to re-employ the older workers today.&nbsp; There must be enough models, practices and structures for the companies to learn from one another before 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the models will keep evolving.&nbsp;&nbsp;70% today are doing the same job but with&nbsp;lower pay.&nbsp; But we suspect more may be on the same pay, if we are able to move to a rate for the job.&nbsp; We do not expect a company to have only one model.&nbsp; There could be a company because&nbsp;certain grades are more competitive.&nbsp; They could be paying the same rate for the same job.&nbsp; But certain jobs which are not so competitive in the grades, they could be offering them re-employment but at different rates.&nbsp; So there will not be a fixed model to apply to all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what we have to do is we will have more cases of re-employment to actually offer to more companies and let them have a view of how this is being done.&nbsp; We do not know how this is going to be like.&nbsp; But I think what we know is that we do have a responsibility to our workers and we have a responsibility to the businesses to make sure that whatever system will work here and be sustainable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1576<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think underlying all these changes is the good labour-management relationship that we have with the company,&nbsp;because there was mutual trust, understanding and shared values on the subject.&nbsp; We will continue to build on that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, the 319 companies committed will work with us to develop the skills employability of workers, provide suitable working conditions as well as employment opportunities for the workforce that is ageing and to maintain and promote the health and working capability of the workers.&nbsp; It is not too late to build up the nest egg today.&nbsp; Working longer will certainly help.&nbsp; Of course, the enhanced WIS and the additional 1% CPF interest rate should help to enhance the retirement savings.&nbsp; What we have is&nbsp;also some debate on the compulsory annuity.&nbsp; If only four in 10 CPF members have met this Minimum Sum when they reach 55, many of them wonder what&nbsp;this annuity value that they can draw down at the age of 85 will be like&nbsp;because we are talking about $400 in 30 years' time.&nbsp; What will be the worth of $400 in 2042 or, maybe, 2050?&nbsp; There were suggestions that, since this is&nbsp;a pooling of resources, Government should, during budget surpluses, consider the top-up accounts of this pool so that we have more to enjoy with higher value.&nbsp; I think this would be a good demonstration of shared responsibilities since CPF comes from employers and workers.&nbsp; So Government could&nbsp;probably consider some topping up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The statistics also show on the average&nbsp;that women have lower CPF savings than the men.&nbsp; We all know that many women leave the workforce after they have started their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;So they have not accumulated enough.&nbsp; Yet, we expect the premiums for the women&nbsp;to be higher because of the longer life expectancy.&nbsp; So how would they be able to pay for the premiums?&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, MOS Gan mentioned about the employment<p align=left>Column: 1577<p> opportunities for more women to come back to work, they are probably working on some employment opportunities.&nbsp; But I would also suggest that we make it mandatory for the husband to top up the wife's CPF, at least to pay for the basic longevity insurance, if the husband has met his Minimum Sum scheme.&nbsp; I do not think it is too much.&nbsp; If he has met the Minimum Sum scheme, probably he can consider topping up just the annuity amount.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My last point is the group of&nbsp;contract and casual workers.&nbsp; These are workers whom we are most concerned with their CPF savings.&nbsp; Most do not have much.&nbsp; Yet, they&nbsp;will certainly have to adjust to the draw-down age&nbsp;and the compulsory annuity.&nbsp; So when the withdrawal of the 50% eventually kicks in in 2012 or&nbsp;2013, we doubt&nbsp;many would have any balance to withdraw at 55.&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers have asked to let them withdraw a small part, say, $2,000 to $3,000 when they reach 62.&nbsp; While it is not much money,&nbsp;that is something that they will look forward to at the age of 55, hopefully, they have a little bit.&nbsp; At the age of 62, probably just $2,000 to $3,000, half of the $5,000, I think that will certainly make them&nbsp; very happy and they will certainly work much harder.&nbsp; But, of course, the important issue for this group of contract workers is that we need to ramp up our efforts to ensure that they be paid CPF so that they can build up their retirement savings like any other formal workers.&nbsp; In NTUC, through our unit for contract and casual workers and help through our unions, we manage to get some 5,000 workers converted to the CPF scheme over the last one year.&nbsp; While it is not a big number, I think we are quite encouraged&nbsp;with that.&nbsp; Of course, this&nbsp;is done through a lot of persuasion, a lot of education and a little bit of enforcement.&nbsp; We&nbsp;understand that some&nbsp;160,000 applied for the <p align=left>Column: 1578<p>Workfare Bonus, previously through their own declaration, and we believe a large group of them would not have CPF contributions.&nbsp; We also understand, when we talked to our people, that a lot of them&nbsp;should be entitled to this WIS or even the previous Workfare, but they were not aware of the scheme and, as a result, they did not apply for it.&nbsp; So we would like to urge the Government to conduct probably more&nbsp;road shows at some centralised industrial areas, where they&nbsp;are densely populated with such contract workers,&nbsp;heartland shopping malls and&nbsp;bus interchanges to create more awareness of the scheme and the rights of the workers,&nbsp;because we have to bring more of these workers onto the CPF scheme.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I believe that the changes announced are necessary and we certainly support the changes.&nbsp; But there are many issues that we have to continue to tackle.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to listen, we need to apply our hearts and our minds, try whatever is possible&nbsp;and work together.&nbsp; I think at the end of the day,&nbsp;we must succeed and we need to succeed in our uniquely Singapore way.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.22 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lam Pin Min (Ang Mo Kio):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, having spoken to many of my grassroots leaders, constituents and friends after the National Day Rally, some of the responses and feedback I gathered can be summarised as follows:&nbsp; \"Why cannot the Government give us back our hard-earned money earlier?\" \"The first thing I want to do is to pamper myself and go on a well-deserved long awaited holiday.\"&nbsp; \"Why worry about it?&nbsp; I don't foresee myself living till 80.\"&nbsp; \"As long as I am healthy and able to continue working, it doesn't matter.\"<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people must be wondering if we could predict who will reach a ripe old age.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 1579<p>The short answer is an obvious \"No\"!&nbsp; However, statistics have shown that the average life expectancy has jumped from 61 years five decades ago to about 80 years today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life is a bit of a lottery and there is a certain whimsical element which forbids us from predicting the future.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are a number of things we, both the responsible Government and the receptive citizens, can do to swing the odds in favour of a long, fulfilling and independent life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Boxing Day of 2004 in Phuket, when the sea water suddenly receded far from the usual water marks, leaving many fishes exposed on the beaches, many villagers and tourists had naively run out to catch the rare wonderful sight and to reap the unexpected catch.&nbsp; Many were ignorant and oblivious that this&nbsp;was a sign of impending disaster and were caught off-guard when the gigantic deadly tidal waves swept in shore killing thousands.&nbsp; Had we known then and made the appropriate preparations, many innocent lives would have been saved.&nbsp; Reacting now to the dangers of tsunami after an earthquake, many nations have put in place early warning systems to caution the possibility of an impending tsunami affecting their coastal regions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a similar note, Singapore is also facing a tsunami of a different kind, threatening to engulf us if we do not put in place necessary policy changes to respond to it.&nbsp; The Singapore society is beset with several foreboding trends - the falling fertility rate, smaller family size, longer life expectancy and, consequently, a rapidly greying population.&nbsp; To put things in perspective, as what the Minister has alluded to in his statement today, the number of working adults supporting those not working, ie, the support ratio is about 8:1: all things being equal, the support ratio will decrease to 4:1 by year 2030.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1580<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of our society is set to change with the increasing proportion of elderly in the very near future.&nbsp; A conscientious and proactive look at the predictors of an ageing population over the next 20-25 years has motivated the Government to seriously rework its policies on retirement and CPF changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes to the CPF announced by the Prime Minister during the National Day Rally has generated mixed reactions from the public.&nbsp; The proposal to make the buying of an annuity compulsory has stirred emotions among many Singaporeans. Because of its compulsory nature, many Singaporeans have put up a mental resistance to an otherwise sane and rational policy.&nbsp; Many argued the rationale for making it compulsory when it is their own money and such a move further restricts their freedom to use their retirement funds as they see fit.&nbsp; Can the annuity plan be made an opt-out system, just like the ElderShield scheme?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, instead of a national longevity insurance scheme to take care of one's longevity needs, can we stretch out the draw-down period from the current 20 years to, say, 25 or even 30 years?&nbsp; This would sufficiently cover a majority of CPF members till they are 90 or 95 years of age respectively.&nbsp; The argument for such a proposal is that by setting aside a certain amount from the Minimum Sum for the annuity plan when members turn 55, the draw-down amount would be reduced and the longevity payout after age 85 would be a mere $200 to $300.&nbsp; Would not stretching out the draw-down period serve almost the same objective?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, can CPF members who have already purchased similar private insurance plan be exempted from this new proposed annuity plan?&nbsp; What about those members with multiple medical illnesses who are often deemed by insurers to be at a higher risk of earlier death?&nbsp; To make <p align=left>Column: 1581<p>them subscribe to the compulsory annuity would tantamount to selective underwriting which would be deemed unfair to them.&nbsp; If possible, the annuity plan should be made as flexible as possible with the basic plan being affordable to all.&nbsp; Any additional supplementary requirements can be made optional to cater to the diverse and peculiar needs of individual Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1% CPF interest rate hike is a much welcome move by many Singaporeans.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

What is the rationale for pegging the ceiling at $60,000?&nbsp; Does it not make more sense to peg it to the prevailing Minimum Sum since this is the amount assessed to be the bare minimum needed for the retirement needs of an average Singaporean?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has also been announced that the interest rate for the Special, Medisave and Retirement accounts will be pegged to the long-term bond yield.&nbsp; Although it has been revealed that the long-term benefits to members will be enhanced with the expected gains to be more than the current 4%, it is also a fact that it can vary undesirably in times of poor economic performance.&nbsp; Can the Government instead guarantee a minimum 4% interest range, which is what Singaporeans are already enjoying regardless of the market performance?&nbsp; This would give CPF members, especially the low-income and middle-income Singaporeans,&nbsp;peace of mind and that they do not lose out excessively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having mentioned some of the concerns of CPF members, what about those Singaporeans who do not contribute to CPF, namely the homemakers, self-employed and contract workers?&nbsp; How<p align=left>Column: 1582<p> then can their needs be looked after in this&nbsp;often-neglected group?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's effort to ensure Singaporeans' retirement adequacy is laudable.&nbsp; Not many governments in the world would make such a long-term, bold strategic planning and policy change to ensure that their citizens are self-sufficient in their old age.&nbsp; However, the initiative to raise the minimum draw-down age from 62 to 65 must be coupled with a robust system of ensuring re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; Legislating re-employment of older workers through the Re-employment Act is a necessary and correct step forward.&nbsp; However, employers' buy-in is absolutely critical for a win-win solution in the preparation for an ageing workforce in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on that note, I support the motion.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.29 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak on this topic.&nbsp; I support the CPF reforms and the other measures for a secure retirement shared by Minister Ng Eng Hen in his Ministerial Statement.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to still share what I am hearing from my interactions with residents and grassroots on the subject to ensure that these feedbacks are taken into consideration on the execution of the measures.&nbsp; The feedbacks centre around two common threads, ie, the need for retirement planning and the point about whether the planned CPF reforms are the best solution for Singapore in achieving the desired retirement plan.&nbsp; The three thrusts of CPF reforms that Minister Ng had shared were around the later draw-down on CPF savings, covering the risks of those living longer than expected when making CPF savings last for life, hence some form of compulsory annuity for <p align=left>Column: 1583<p>those below 50 years of age that they have to contribute, and improving the returns on CPF savings, that 1% increase on the first $60,000 in the CPF account.</p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me touch on the point about the need for retirement planning.&nbsp; I think there is a general sense of disbelief that we are all going to live so long.&nbsp; But at the same time, in the feedback that I have received, there is a recognition by many that our population is ageing and it is timely that the Government has brought up the importance of the need for retirement planning.&nbsp; Although this may not be a popular initiative, I do applaud the Government for being forward-looking and willing to address this issue which will not actually impact us in the near term.&nbsp; But it is important as it has broad implications for the future.&nbsp; If pro-active plans are not made, as Minister Ng has shared on the details of the ageing population, plus the declining support ratio, this does have an adverse impact on the overall economy and the quality of life.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Abraham Lincoln so nicely put it,&nbsp;\"you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today\".&nbsp; So, in terms of the actual support for these policies, there is a general sense that we need them.&nbsp; It is now the \"how\".&nbsp; So let us go on to the point about whether the proposed CPF changes are the best approach to achieve the desired retirement plan for Singaporeans.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fundamental principle of the proposed changes assumes a national approach&nbsp;that requires every individual to take responsibility for planning for his retirement.&nbsp; So the general sentiment is: should the Government also not help in the scheme?&nbsp; What is coming across is that individuals are now asked to take accountability for their retirement funds, which I think people can accept.&nbsp; But the fundamental change is also the fact that there is a request now and there is shift to say we should also share the risks by <p align=left>Column: 1584<p>pooling our funds together.&nbsp; And that is something that will take some time, in terms of acceptance, because it is a fairly different concept and approach from what we have previously been advocating.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, also on the question of how the Government is supporting the scheme, Minister Ng, in his Statement, did show that the financial aspects will definitely be covered.&nbsp; For example, both in the WIS as well as the higher CPF interest rates, $400 million and $700 million respectively, would be put in yearly.&nbsp; That is not a small amount.&nbsp; So the Government financially is putting in that so-called share in the pie.&nbsp; Also, the one-off D- and V-Bonuses of another $1.2 billion.&nbsp; But I want to actually touch on the point that I do not think the financial aspects are going to be sufficient.&nbsp; It is more than that that needs to be done because the proposed CPF changes on drawing down of CPF savings later, from 62 to 65 years of age, to enable CPF savings to last longer, hinges on the very fact that people must be able to continue to work and to work longer.&nbsp; Hence, the need for the re-employment legislation.&nbsp; That is good.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But delaying the withdrawal of the CPF Minimum Sum payout to age 65, as seen by some, could be also depriving those who do not have work or are unable for whatever reasons to work to actually get the financial support they need when they need it.&nbsp; I am quite sure my fellow colleagues here in their various MPS sessions will tell you, even today,&nbsp;many of our residents come and say, \"Why do I need to plan for the future when I cannot even get past today?\"&nbsp; So I think those are some of the things that we will really need to look at, those who really need it, how are they going to handle this delay in their withdrawals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The feedback we have received from residents, grassroots and even our GPC Resource Panels also indicates a concern<p align=left>Column: 1585<p> on the actual manifestation of the re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; I know it has been lots of work that are already done with employers.&nbsp; I applaud the efforts and I am glad to see the progress there.&nbsp; But there is a worry that employers may abuse the system by early termination of the services of those who are nearing the retirement age when that legislation actually comes into place.&nbsp; Or that workers will be asked to do the same work for less once they reach the age of 62.&nbsp; This is where the Government can assist.&nbsp; There are specific industries and business segments that actually recognise the value-add of experienced workers.&nbsp; The Government can work with industry associations to promote these businesses as exemplary and this will send a strong signal to both employers and employees.&nbsp; I think the punitive measures are important, but I also think that the ability to showcase and really bring these positive messages up are just as important.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one of the members from our GPC Resource Panel for Trade and Industry puts it very nicely,&nbsp; \"People do not magically lose their skills and abilities at some fixed age.&nbsp; These workers should continue to be rewarded accordingly for their contributions despite being a day older when they reach 62.\"&nbsp; While recognising that there will be those who need to be deployed to alternative positions due to health or personal preferences with appropriate adjustments in salary and other benefits, some have expressed that the implementation of the re-employment legislation should also be, if possible, put in earlier than 2012.&nbsp; That is a consideration, given all the work that has already been done, whether that is also a possibility.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another feedback is that the Government, being the largest employer, should take the lead in the rehiring of older workers, to set the example for the<p align=left>Column: 1586<p> private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was shared earlier in this House that that is already done.&nbsp; But I think that there is more that can be done, as well as more that can be shared, with regard to what is being done in this phase.&nbsp; There will also be a need for programmes around training, to ready older workers for re-employment opportunities.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, making the CPF savings last for life and also the point about compulsory annuity for those below 50 years of age, from the various channels of feedback, the question asked by many is:&nbsp; why make the annuity compulsory?&nbsp; This is a shift from each having the responsibility to plan for his own retirement to one that is asking every one to pool their resources to share the risks.&nbsp; Many see this as unfair, as it would mean that if they do not live past 85 years of age, they would not have benefited from the scheme and that their monies would have been locked in the scheme.&nbsp; So can flexibility be offered in the scheme, in terms of the type of plans?&nbsp; It is heartening to hear from Minister Ng that a committee will be formed to study and recommend the best schemes, taking feedback from various industry experts.&nbsp; Minister Ng also mentioned that flexibility and options will be offered based on risk-sharing and also accommodating the different options, like the stretching out of the payment as well as early opting-in.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to note what Minister Ng has also shared, that those with annuities will also be eligible to be considered for the D- and V-Bonuses.&nbsp; The questions I have are: how will this work?&nbsp; Would this also be applicable to those with participating insurance plans as well?&nbsp; Another sentiment that was shared about the annuities was why 85?&nbsp; I have seen all the statistics, that probably that is the age after which people would need help.&nbsp; But could they not start earlier, for example, around 75 or 80?&nbsp; I guess that would also have impact on the actual premiums and the amounts to be paid.&nbsp; So those are <p align=left>Column: 1587<p>considerations.&nbsp; Maybe, there will be options given around them when the committee gets together.<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the annuities provide the regular payout post age 85, I believe there are also complementary programmes in other areas that will need to be taken into consideration, such as health services, transportation, etc,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I would not elaborate. But I think those need to be handled in complementarity.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other question, of course, is whether the annuity scheme will work.&nbsp; Can all CPF members afford the annuity?&nbsp; What happens if CPF members are unable to meet the Minimum Sum?&nbsp; This is the very group that will need it.&nbsp;In the CPF 2006 Annual Report, it was indicated that approximately 36,000 active CPF members aged 50-55 years of age had total balances of less than the Minimum Sum.&nbsp; The total balances included residential investment amounts as well.&nbsp; Although this is not a large number, the question still needs to be answered.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the question of the inclusion of retirement planning of those who are not in the workforce.&nbsp; For example, earlier in this House, we talked about women who have left the workforce to take care of children and family members.&nbsp; This is an important area to consider, given that the workforce participation rate of women is 54.3% in 2006.&nbsp; Hence, women out of the workforce are not a small proportion.&nbsp; Women, on average, as indicated by many, also live longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;The female workforce participation rate in 2006 was comparable to that of males in the age group 20-29.&nbsp; However, from age group 30-34, it was 77%, and we see a steady decline, whilst that for the men stayed in the high 90% range.&nbsp;Between 40-44 years of age, participation dropped to 67.7%, sharply dropping to 44.7% after 55.&nbsp;It is not just at the later years, but all through from 30, all the way, we are seeing the decline.&nbsp; If<p align=left>Column: 1588<p> we believe that retirement planning is important, then this is a sizeable proportion of the population that really needs to be taken care of who cannot participate in the scheme because they are not in the workforce.&nbsp;<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our colleague, Ms Cham Hui Fong, actually shared that maybe we should make it compulsory for husbands, if they are able to meet the Minimum Sum, to contribute to their wives' annuity payment.&nbsp; That may be a good suggestion that we can consider because it would not be too much to ask.<br></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The male participation rate, even though it was declining for those in the later age groups, is still about 81.9%.&nbsp; So the discrepancy is quite huge.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last point that I would like to mention is what could go wrong.&nbsp; What are the risks in there?&nbsp; Some of my colleagues have already shared whether this scheme is sustainable.&nbsp; A recent example is that of the Japan pension system.&nbsp; I know our system will be different.&nbsp; But the Japan pension system and the US 401k investments show the need for risk management to prevent a scenario where annuity members may not receive the amount of funds as promised when they expect it.&nbsp; That is an area of consideration that we hope will also be shared.&nbsp; For example, will this risk management model be sustainable and be really risk-free?&nbsp; Will the percentages, that floor of 2.5% mentioned earlier, be sustainable?<br></p><p></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, if I could summarise with an analogy of the umbrella which I used previously in this House and which our colleague, Dr Ahmad Magad, also shared, when we provide an umbrella, some may view it as shelter and be grateful for it; others may otherwise see it as blocking their view.&nbsp; The challenge is how to strike a balance in the approach to retirement planning.&nbsp; Many do accept<p align=left>Column: 1589<p> that there is a need for the umbrella, ie, retirement planning and having secure retirement funds.&nbsp; However, some feel that some flexibility should be given to when and how we use the umbrella and, finally, whether we have ownership of that umbrella.<br></p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Halimah Yacob--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Adequacy of retirement income</I></p><p><I><br></I> &nbsp;&nbsp; I have a couple of questions to raise on the CPF reforms. First, I would like to ask the Minister whether the current reforms&nbsp;have adequately addressed the issue of adequacy of the retirement income.&nbsp; The Minister has spent some time explaining the new formula but let me explain what I mean.&nbsp; Singapore has long relied on the CPF as the only source of retirement income. Hence,&nbsp;the question that people would naturally ask is whether the change in the formula for computing the interest rate would enhance the returns on our CPF balances. The Minister has explained how the re-pegged SMRA rates will work which, together with the additional 1% interest rate, is meant to benefit CPF members even more.&nbsp; But&nbsp;what I think we need is also information about what kind of replacement rate this new formula will produce compared to the old formula so that we will have a better idea about the adequacy of our retirement income with these reforms, and the impact of the new rate of return on our CPF money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, we measure the adequacy of our retirement income by looking at the<p align=left>Column: 1590<p> replacement rate, which is the ratio of the retirement income to the pre-retirement income. The replacement rate depends on the GDP growth, the rate of growth of wages as well as the impact of inflation on the retirement income. I hope that the Minister could shed more light on this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other point that I would like to raise is with regard to the capping of the additional 1% interest rate to $60,000.&nbsp; In my view, it would be more appropriate to cap the additional 1% at the existing Minimum Sum amount, as this is the amount which, by its own calculations, the Government deems to be the minimum amount needed for people to live on after their retirement.&nbsp; It is therefore only appropriate that the entire Minimum Sum should draw a larger interest payment.&nbsp; The Minister had mentioned that the formula will be reviewed after five years.&nbsp; I hope that the Minister would give this point greater consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Higher Minimum Sum draw-down age</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now come to the higher draw-down age. One major concern of our unionists, widely reflected already by other speakers, which was again echoed at the recent NTUC pre-delegates conference, is whether there will be jobs for workers after 62. So long as there are jobs, our unionists feel that a&nbsp;later draw-down age is not a major issue, as people will continue to have an income to live on.&nbsp; However, if there are no jobs and the draw-down age is shifted, this would cause tremendous hardship. Workers' concerns are genuine as currently, only&nbsp;four out of 10 Singaporeans aged 60 to 64 are working, and healthcare needs grow with age.&nbsp; Many low-income Singaporeans do not have any other source of income to depend on if they cannot draw down their Minimum Sum at the age of 62 and they are unemployed. The NTUC has been working very closely with our tripartite partners to promote the re-employment of older workers.&nbsp; Through<p align=left>Column: 1591<p> these efforts, 3,080 workers above 62 have been re-employed.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like, Sir,&nbsp;to quote two excellent examples of older workers who have remained employed and their equally enlightened employers who are worthy of mention. The first is the case of Mdm Chong Bee Neo who is 71 years old and who is employed as a general worker by Nelco Private Limited, an electronics company under the United Workers of Electronics and Electrical Industries which manufactures PCB boards. Mdm Neo has worked in Nelco for 13 years. Prior to that, she had worked in the Kiwi shoe polish factory for 38 years before it closed down. Nelco pays her a total of $1,200 and she enjoys the same benefits as other workers. When I spoke to her, Mdm Neo told me that she enjoys her work and her employer treats her well.&nbsp; I asked her how long she intends to work and she said that she would do so for as long as she is healthy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other case that I would like to mention is that of Mr Kumaran Kunjoo, who is also 71 years old and is employed as a consultant in one of our unions, the Singapore Maritime Officers Union, which represents maritime officers.&nbsp; Kumaran has been an employee of the union since 1986, after he was retrenched by Selco, which went bust. He was a seafarer for 21 years before joining SMOU.&nbsp; In 2002, at the age of 67, Kumaran was retired by SMOU, and he&nbsp;was re-employed by the union as a consultant. With his vast experience and positive work attitude, Kumaran is a valued employee of SMOU.&nbsp; He told me that he would work for as long as he is able to as he thinks that he would become lazy and sick if he does not work.&nbsp; These two examples show that age is not a barrier to employment if both the older worker as well as the employer is prepared to make adjustments and, particularly, if employers are prepared to give the older workers a chance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1592<p><p><I>Proposed re-employment law<br></I><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the proposed re-employment law, our unionists welcome it but felt that five years is too long and have asked that the Minister consider legislating it much earlier, perhaps in three years' time instead, as after all, the proposed law is not an automatic extension of employment, but merely makes it compulsory for employers to re-offer employment which could be in different jobs and on different terms.&nbsp; Although there has been progress made in our re-employment efforts,&nbsp;there are still some employers who want to adopt a wait-and-see attitude basically to buy themselves some time.&nbsp; I feel that having this law in place before the later draw-down age takes effect in 2012 for those who are 57 now, would do a great deal in helping to generate greater confidence in the reforms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Ensure that legislation is enforceable and&nbsp;provide for dispute settlement mechanism</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another concern raised by unionists is over the effectiveness of the proposed re-employment law. One feedback from our Japanese trade union colleagues about their re-employment law, which forms the basis for our current re-employment law, is that it lacks teeth and is not enforceable. We should avoid the same pitfalls and ensure that our re-employment legislation is enforceable against errant employers.&nbsp; Another concern that this proposed legislation should address is bogus or sham offers of re-employment.&nbsp; The legislation should provide for a mediation or dispute resolution mechanism for older workers to refer their grievances to if they are given terms of employment which are not genuine or the terms are so drastically reduced and are not commensurate with their contributions, qualifications or experience to make it impossible for the older worker to accept the offer of re-employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1593<p><p><I>Public sector and GLCs should set the lead</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we would also urge the public sector and Government-linked companies to set the lead in the re-employment of older workers. Again, this is an issue of confidence as the private sector employers always pop this question when we ask them to re-employ older workers.&nbsp; If the public sector and the Government-linked companies do not set a good example, we have less moral authority to start pushing private sector employers to do so. We have heard Minister Teo explaining about the steps being taken by the public sector to promote re-employment of older workers and we certainly hope to see more Government-linked companies, especially the larger ones, announcing such initiatives before the legislation kicks in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Longevity insurance</I></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now touch on the longevity insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few points to make. First,&nbsp;insurance represents a marked shift in our approach towards retirement financing. Since 1957, our policy has been that each Singaporean should work and save for his own retirement. But now, for the first time, we are told to do risk-pooling, where we contribute a portion of our savings to a pool and help to provide for other people's needs as well.&nbsp; This is not an easy change for many to digest, as one major problem is that many people still do not believe that they will live beyond 85.&nbsp; They worry that someone else will benefit at their expense.&nbsp; Worse still, some even feel that the longevity insurance will not benefit the poor and low-income as they believe that it is the rich that will live longer.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people are also suspicious of the longevity insurance because they fear that<p align=left>Column: 1594<p>the Government is transferring its responsibility of taking care of the poor and needy to Singaporeans. The Government has explained that this longevity insurance is a form of risk-pooling. This is well and good but Singaporeans are asking why is it that they have to carry all the risks themselves.&nbsp; What is the Government's contribution to this risk-pooling?&nbsp; In other words, where is the social risk-pooling element? &nbsp;They feel that it would be more palatable if the Government could contribute something by injecting some funds into the pool. With the additional Government funding, many Singaporeans feel that the payout after 85 could be more meaningful and the premiums could be kept affordable.&nbsp; Singaporeans also feel that the Government should top up for those with no Minimum Sum or whose Minimum Sum is insufficient to pay for the longevity insurance, with housewives being a particular concern as there are many without the Minimum Sum and women, as we know, live longer.&nbsp; On this point, I note that the premium for women will be higher.&nbsp; As women have a lower Minimum Sum, this would cause hardship, and I would therefore like to urge the Government&nbsp;to impose a standard rate of premium, regardless of gender.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others have argued that the amount of $250 to $300 is too small and insignificant and will be completely eroded by inflation by the time we reach 85 years of age.&nbsp; So, they question the usefulness of the longevity insurance in providing for the financial needs of those who live beyond 85 years of age.</p><p>I hope that these concerns would be fully addressed so as to generate greater confidence in the CPF reforms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Choices -&nbsp;basic tier for everyone</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, although the longevity insurance is not the complete answer to retirement financing for those above 85 years, it is a good start and as<p align=left>Column: 1595<p> Singaporeans, we should give more thought to it. &nbsp;We should carefully study the proposal, give our feedback and make sure that the scheme really works for us. &nbsp;The feedback from our unionists is that this should not be a one-size-fits-all longevity insurance scheme as there should be choices given to CPF members. They suggest that the Government introduce a scheme akin to the MediShield and ElderShield schemes, which I think Minister Ng had also mentioned, by having a basic tier that covers everyone, but which provides only basic benefits so that the premiums could be kept as low as possible and the amount to be taken out from the Minimum Sum will not be too large. For those who want a bigger payment and for the money to be returned to their family if they die early, they could purchase an additional or enhanced tier and pay higher premiums from their Minimum Sum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>CPF Board should administer the basic tier</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our unionists also suggested that the CPF Board should administer the basic tier to benefit from economies of scale, lower administration costs and, more importantly, a higher rate of return. Currently, annuities are not popular because the average rate of return at about 2.3% is far too low and is worse than the Minimum Sum rate of 4%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Additional or enhanced tier can be provided by private insurers but limit amount that can be used from the Minimum Sum</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The additional or enhanced tier could be provided by private insurance companies but here, I would like to urge the Government to impose a limit on the amount of the Minimum Sum that can be withdrawn for the second tier as we also want to ensure that CPF members continue to have enough savings to live on between the age of 65&nbsp;and 85 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1596<p><p><I>Give CPF members a choice to have longer draw-down date in place of longevity insurance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A final suggestion is to give CPF members a choice to opt for a longer draw-down period instead of purchasing the longevity insurance. Hence, instead of 85 years, CPF members can opt to stretch their Minimum Sum up to 90 years or 95 years, depending on their needs.&nbsp; This proposal is consistent with the objective of the longevity insurance and there is no reason why it cannot be considered.&nbsp; I think Dr Ng has also alluded to that in his Statement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would appreciate the Minister's response and comments on the various points that I have raised. Let me conclude, Sir, by sharing with this House the conversation that I had with Irene who cleans our Parliament's toilets.&nbsp; Irene is a contract worker who earns $700 a month.&nbsp; The first question I asked her, being a trade unionist, is whether she is paid CPF.&nbsp; And Irene immediately retorted, \"Of course.\"&nbsp; She said, \"If not, if grow old, how?\"&nbsp; Irene most aptly captured the heart of this debate and that is the question of \"how\".&nbsp; How are we to take care of our old age?&nbsp; How are we to live if our life extends beyond 85 years?&nbsp; We may not be able to answer the \"how\" questions completely and fully as no country has found a foolproof solution.&nbsp; But, at least, we have started to look at some ways how to do so as the <I>status quo</I> is neither a desirable nor a responsible approach.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5.55 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Jalan Besar):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;we should give credit where credit is due. A political leadership that is not responsible would have opted&nbsp;to delay this difficult issue of retirement&nbsp;security for at least&nbsp;a few more election terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I salute the <p align=left>Column: 1597<p>Government for deciding to tackle this potential time-bomb head-on.<p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Key thrusts</I></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are&nbsp;two key thrusts behind the slew of CPF policy changes:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, to help Singaporeans work longer, and, two,&nbsp;to ensure Singaporeans have enough savings to last their life expectancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Realities</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind these key thrusts are four&nbsp;major realities or restraining forces that Government must address if the desired outcome of financial security in old age&nbsp;is to be achieved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are vulnerable groups of Singaporeans who could be left out in this reform&nbsp;exercise unless policy-makers acknowledge them and take a lead in helping these groups.&nbsp; One vulnerable group comprises Singaporeans especially from the average and low-income&nbsp;families -&nbsp;housewives or single Singaporeans who stay home to look after their children or elderly parents not by choice but by necessity.&nbsp; Another vulnerable group is made up of Singaporeans with mild to severe disabilities who will not be able to find sustained employment and, therefore, no CPF contributions unless more&nbsp;impactful support is given by Government.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third vulnerable group comprises Singaporeans with adult disabled children or people who not only have problems taking care of their own retirement, but also have to look after their disabled dependants.&nbsp; Even if they&nbsp;wish, these are folks who cannot&nbsp;afford to apply the typical airline advice to \"put on their oxygen mask first before they help their disabled dependants.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1598<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second reality, Sir, is \"not all Singaporeans want to work\".&nbsp; Sir, there is a big groan out there on the ground by both elderly and younger Singaporeans who want to retire early and stop working.&nbsp; Many have the psychological clock in their minds and want to drop their vocation for the vacation they feel they well deserve,</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>whether or not they have sufficient funds to retire.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the third reality is that not all Singaporeans know how much they need to retire for different reasons. Financial security&nbsp;surveys in recent years in Singapore have concluded that the level of financial literacy amongst Singaporeans is appalling, even amongst the educated and English-speaking Singaporeans.&nbsp; Some of them are averse to numbers. Some suffer from what I call the \"ostrich syndrome\" and prefer not to know the risks the future holds, either due to lethargy, indifference or fear of the big gap between what they have and what they need.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth reality is that not&nbsp;all Singaporeans fully accept the Government's approach, and some of them think that they are being denied access to money that rightfully belongs to them.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ground feedback has surfaced many key messages that will need to be addressed.&nbsp; The more educated, affluent and financially savvy Singaporeans are grumbling that this is yet another testament of Government's paternalistic style of \"I know what's best for you.\" &nbsp;There are even rumours that the Government is running out of money; that the whole CPF exercise is leaving the people to fend for themselves and Government is bearing no cost, and questions of where the additional GST revenues have gone to.&nbsp; All these questions&nbsp;need to be addressed. Sir, many of these perceptions may be untrue but perceptions are realities and must be addressed and crucial dialogues, not monologues, need to be held.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1599<p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the task of finding the sweet spot for the right final solution without over simplifying the subject matter will require skill and wisdom. &nbsp;Here are a few suggestions I hope the committee will consider.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all know that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to meet the diverse retirement needs of a few million people. &nbsp;Whilst there is no way any government can provide a boutique solution for each Singaporean, it is necessary for policy-makers to identify key demographic groups and provide at least a simple menu of options in (1) retirement planning; (2) promoting financial literacy; and (3) communicating with Singaporeans on the retirement policy reforms.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a Singaporean who can work, wants to work and needs to work beyond 62, legislation, employer incentives, job redesign&nbsp;and retraining are indeed the key solutions.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the more vulnerable Singaporeans who are disabled, I want to challenge job-creation and job-design agencies, such as the NTUC and the Ministry of Manpower. The Disability Office that was recommended under the Enabling Master Plan this year for the disabled has yet to physically meet.&nbsp; I ask that the co-coordinating Ministry to please include the NTUC and&nbsp;MOM in their mission so that younger disabled Singaporeans can look to jobs as a means of ensuring their own financial independence, so that they can look towards paying income tax instead of collecting welfare.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For families who are hit by the double whammy of both low income and disability, I urge the Government to look into measures to help top up their retirement accounts.&nbsp; This top-up can be done by, eg, through potential progress package funds, through proceeds from the IR operations, through encouraging philanthropists and&nbsp;foundations to help some of<p align=left>Column: 1600<p> these vulnerable Singaporeans purchase DPS or top up their retirement accounts.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in promoting financial literacy, we can take reference from the United States Department of Treasury and develop our own \"Made in Singapore\" blueprint for a National Strategy for Financial Literacy.&nbsp; A coordinating Ministry should take the lead and coordinate agencies, such as the CDC, self-help organisations like the CDAC, MUIS and SINDA, or even&nbsp;private sector firms, to enhance the financial literacy and security of our people. &nbsp;Again, I caution against the one-size-fits-all approach.&nbsp; Do develop a matrix of mix of communication channels to effectively reach the target groups.&nbsp; Portals and interactive web-based financial calculators are only for specific segments of Singaporeans. Many Singaporeans, especially those who are less IT-savvy and less educated, need to be reached differently. Some of the&nbsp;more vulnerable Singaporeans will even need to be hand-held and financial planning done for them sometimes.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, effectively, balancing the tension between over-simplification and over-complexity is one critical success factors behind the reforms.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ex-United States&nbsp;Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once said that he would give his right arm for \"the simplicity on the far side of complexity\".&nbsp; This quote has challenged many leaders in both private and public sectors to develop simpler and more elegant solutions to important problems.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holmes implied there are&nbsp;two types of simplicity. The first is what we can call \"counterfeit simplicity\" - the result of ignoring hard realities and complexities. Ignoring the realities that not all Singaporeans can and want to work nor interested in financial planning&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;over-simplifying things.&nbsp; Another over-simplification could be for planners to forget that&nbsp;beyond the current Minimum Sum and longevity insurance, are other<p align=left>Column: 1601<p> input factors towards the retirement planning equation,&nbsp;input factors&nbsp;such as healthcare costs, one's asset portfolio, one's desired lifestyle, the HDB flat buy back, ElderShield, MediShield and the DPS.&nbsp; The retirement equation must take into account all these other factors.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second type of simplicity, a more desirable one that Holmes implied,&nbsp;is the result from the ability to seeing past the apparent chaos of the complexity to develop an elegantly simpler and more optimal solution.&nbsp; This is what is termed as the \"elegance on the far side of complexity\" -&nbsp;a challenge I would pose to the longevity insurance committee and to all others who are working on the final details of these reforms.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion, Sir, I applaud the Government for its moral courage to address and not procrastinate this&nbsp;important&nbsp;aspect of financial security of Singaporeans.&nbsp;I urge that in developing the final details,&nbsp;the people's voices are heard and the needs and concerns of major groups of Singaporeans&nbsp;are addressed, especially the vulnerable Singaporeans,&nbsp;and that as far as possible, no&nbsp;Singaporean is left behind.</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"MsoPlainText\" style=\"MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the reforms.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.04 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070917/20070917VS_121417.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.] &nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, during his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister has raised the phenomena of an ageing population, and many Singaporeans are aware of the daunting challenge that we face. When we are walking on the streets, we hear people asking, \"What are we going to do when we get old?\"&nbsp; Someone answered in Hokkien saying, \"You can cry.\"&nbsp; Of course, crying will not be able to help one solve<p align=left>Column: 1602<p> the problem but, most importantly, we must all work together for a solution.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans, after listening to PM's speech, begin to get worried, because there is an old Chinese saying that goes like this, \"&#38752;&#26641;&#26641;&#20498;&#65292;&#38752;&#20154;&#20154;&#36305;&#65292;&#38752;&#33258;&#24049;&#26368;&#22909;\", meaning it is best to depend on oneself.&nbsp; So the Government seems to be telling us that self-reliance is the best.&nbsp; So you must lock up your CPF savings.&nbsp; That is the best.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\"><p>*Cols. 1667-1672.</p><BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the Government's measure.&nbsp; Every year, the Government is going to set aside $700 million to finance the CPF changes in interest rate and it will reduce the people's burden in buying the longevity insurance in future.&nbsp; The Government is not saying that the people must only depend on themselves and that the Government will not care.&nbsp; Some people are worried and they are thinking, \"If you want me to plan for myself after 80 years old, I will have to know first what is going to happen to me when I am 60 years old.&nbsp; If I cannot even look after myself now, how am I going to worry about living beyond 80 years old?\" So the Government must ensure that those who do not have sufficient savings, we should look after them and think of a better solution to help them, especially the self-employed, contract workers and the low-income workers.&nbsp; We cannot allow them to be worried that they do not know what to do.&nbsp; They will say, \"What to do when I am old, I can only cry.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the changes in the CPF scheme are good.&nbsp; It provides D-Bonus and V-Bonus and encourages them to defer their withdrawals. This progressive package will cost the Government $1.2 billion every year.&nbsp; So this is a very important step.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his National Day Rally speech, the Prime Minister said that there are so many old people around us.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans, after listening to PM's speech, wonder whether we really have so many old<p align=left>Column: 1603<p> people.&nbsp; Now, they know that it is really so.&nbsp; Not only that, there is a Hokkien song - I cannot sing this Hokkien song - but I can read out the words. This is a song about not growing old, or do not feel that you are old.&nbsp; The lyrics go like this. Some people say that 90 is old, 80 is uncommon, and 70 is common.&nbsp; What is 60?&nbsp; 50 is so common.&nbsp; It means that if you look around, there are a lot of people who are 90 years old, so 80 is not uncommon.&nbsp; Life begins at 70.&nbsp; What is 60?&nbsp; At 50 years old, you can be a young man.&nbsp; At 40, you are a lovely lad running around.&nbsp; So the message is that old age is inevitable but we can face it.&nbsp; That is the best way to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, there are many people who worry about annuity insurance.&nbsp; What is it all about? So I hope that the committee will explain it better to the people, because many people do not understand this insurance.&nbsp; Why do I have to put the money there, and only after 30 years we withdraw this money?&nbsp; So how do we effectively explain this point?&nbsp; I think it is very important.&nbsp; Many colleagues say, \"Why do I worry about what is going to happen when I am 85.&nbsp; Why not worry about 70 or 75? Can I really live till 80 plus?\"&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is an important point.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our dialogue with union leaders, we realised that many people are worried about this.&nbsp; There is another saying that a doctor cannot heal himself.&nbsp; We are afraid that insurance cannot really insure us.&nbsp; Even the insurance company may collapse.&nbsp; So we all hope that if we have this longevity insurance, the basic package must be maintained by the CPF Board.&nbsp; We can allow certain ancillary packages to the insurance companies, but we cannot transfer the basic protection package to the private companies.&nbsp; We must allow CPF to continue managing this basic package.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many people are worried about how they are going to encourage <p align=left>Column: 1604<p>Singaporeans to accept this scheme.&nbsp; They are also concerned about the group of housewives and what they are going to do.&nbsp; We have received suggestions where the Government can provide matching top-ups for husbands who top up for their wives, so that we can encourage more top-ups for the wives.&nbsp; For those who top up and purchase annuity for their wives, give them additional tax concessions.&nbsp; All these are things which we should consider.&nbsp; For taxi drivers, they are now required to contribute to Medisave, but their Special Accounts do not have much balance left.&nbsp; So we would like to know whether the taxi companies can look into this area and allow better arrangements for the taxi drivers.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People are concerned whether their present CPF is enough or not.&nbsp; Whether we have enough savings is a problem but if we do not save, that is the basic issue.&nbsp; If we do not have the ability to save, that is the basic problem.&nbsp; If we do not even save, then there is no point in discussing about having enough savings. Like what some Members have said about the re-employment of older workers, it is a very important point.&nbsp; In today's newspapers, it is reported that we have 400-plus companies which have started to recruit older workers.&nbsp; So I hope all the employers will not wait any further.&nbsp; They should not just sit there and wait.&nbsp; They should start work now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to note that Minister Teo, in his answer to a question, said that the public sector will take the lead and start an example by employing older workers.&nbsp; This is most important.&nbsp; As Minister Ng said earlier, if you are good and old, then you are gold. It means that you must be good when old, and then you are a treasure. If your health is no good, then it is terrible.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very important point is that we must strengthen our efforts to help the older workers to maintain and improve their health.&nbsp; So I hope every employer will<p align=left>Column: 1605<p> respond to NTUC's \"Your Health Programme\" to improve the health of our workers because there is a Hokkien saying, \"You cannot lose out when you are old.\"&nbsp; What it means is that, \"Well, if you do badly, never mind.&nbsp; Well, it is all right if you die, but your face and reputation&nbsp;are &nbsp;important and, most importantly, when you are old, you should not be weak and lose out.\"&nbsp; That is the most important thing.&nbsp; So our old people are not weak and useless people but they are a productive workforce.&nbsp; In <I>Zaobao</I> yesterday, it was said that Singaporeans lead a hectic life, as they face a longer life expectancy and they pay greater attention to their health condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government tells us that we are facing a longer life expectancy, and thus the need to defer our retirement. But we do not know exactly how many healthy old people are there in the society.&nbsp; Which income group do they belong to? If we have a full grasp of these details, we will know how to look after the middle, lower-income group, provide adequate measures so that they will have a healthy life and live longer because if they are not healthy, then a long life is meaningless.&nbsp; So this is what we need to pay attention to.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to point out a few things that we want and things that we do not want when we get old.&nbsp; After I have spoken to some of the grassroots people, I have a better understanding of their sentiments.&nbsp; What are they worried about?&nbsp; They are afraid that when they are old, they will get worried, they are downhearted.&nbsp; They lose heart and when they are old, they do not have a healthy body and mind.&nbsp; So this is what everybody is worried about.&nbsp; What do we hope to have?&nbsp; We hope to be worry-free, to be relaxed, to be happy and joyful, to be old but have a young heart, and the older we get, the younger our outlook. So we must have a multi-channel approach.&nbsp; What I am proud of is that we are really an action <p align=left>Column: 1606<p>party for the people - we act for the people. And we are seriously looking into solving this difficult problem.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty years later, all of us who are here in Parliament today, we do not need to be worried about this problem.&nbsp; But today, we bring it upon our shoulders to solve the problem.&nbsp; This is an important point, so I hope that all of us will no longer need to worry about depending on others, or ourselves, because the Government will not run away.&nbsp; Let us work together and make all the best arrangements for our old age.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EXEMPTED BUSINESS--><p align=left>Column: 1606<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EXEMPTED BUSINESS:::1606--></b><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>EXEMPTED BUSINESS<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Motion--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Motion)<BR></B></span><div><BR></b>\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the Order Paper for today be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions of Standing Order No. 2. - [Mr Mah Bow Tan].</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MINISTERIAL STATEMENT-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:CPF REFORMS AND OTHER MEASURES FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT--><p align=left>Column: 1606<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:CPF REFORMS AND OTHER MEASURES FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT:::1634--></b><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>CPF REFORMS AND OTHER MEASURES FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debate resumed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources (Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this year REACH conducted an extensive feedback exercise for the changes announced&nbsp;in the Prime Minister's National Day Rally.&nbsp; In all, REACH received a total of 1,035 responses from new media&nbsp;- SMS, e-poll, and online discussions. We also got responses from 268 participants in&nbsp;the old fashioned way - at dialogue sessions as well as the e-townhall webchat.&nbsp; I can confirm that this is by far the most extensive feedback received by REACH on any NDR - which attests to the wide<p align=left>Column: 1607<p>spread public interest to the changes announced by PM.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The overall reception to the key issues raised at the NDR is positive.&nbsp; In fact, 71% of the respondents in the e-poll expressed greater confidence in Singapore's future after listening to or reading PM's NDR message.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, the&nbsp;top three issues across all feedback platforms, and which garnered the most vigorous debate, are in descending order of interest level -&nbsp;the compulsory annuity scheme,&nbsp;the re-employment legislation and&nbsp;deferment of the CPF Minimum Sum draw-down age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to note that the Government is taking into account the preliminary feedback which REACH and others have submitted on these&nbsp;three issues, even as it fine-tunes policy and implementation details.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the additional input received as well as my own investigations, I wish to highlight several other issues relating to the key CPF changes,&nbsp; which the Government can further consider as it gears up to implement the proposed changes.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Compulsory annuity or longevity insurance</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the intent of the compulsory annuity scheme to provide Singaporeans with at least a subsistence standard of living if we live beyond the expiry age of the Minimum Sum payout period.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At a recent dialogue session, one of my grassroots leader shared that he had opted to purchase an annuity when he reached the age of 55 and is now looking forward to the payout of about $700 per month from next year when he reaches 65&nbsp; for the rest of his&nbsp; life.&nbsp; He remarked that he believes the annuity scheme is an excellent idea.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1608<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a poll I&nbsp; conducted with 33 participants on the REACH's e-townhall web chat, only&nbsp;two participants had reservations about the compulsory annuity scheme whilst the majority supported it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This however seems to be the exception rather than the rule and the very positive result occurred after we took pains to explain in detail the rationale of the scheme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the other feedback channels, over the past month, the naysayers outnumber the supporters.&nbsp; It is by far&nbsp; the most hotly debated issue among the slew of changes announced at the NDR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on feedback to REACH, there are&nbsp;four main objections to the scheme.&nbsp; Let me call them the&nbsp;four \"U's\".</p><p><br><I>Unrealistic minimum age limit of 85</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Minister has earlier noted, most people still do not believe they will live long enough to enjoy the annuity payout which only starts after the age of 85.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would seem that whilst many Singaporeans accept the inevitability of ageing, they have not seriously considered the possibility that they themselves may become octogenarians.&nbsp;&nbsp; But statistics show differently and, therefore, whatever their medical condition and state of health, the annuity will come in very useful for someone 85 or older.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A grassroots member of mine noted that&nbsp;it would be useful if the Government could let us know how many in our constituency have already lived past the age of 85 and how many more are likely to be above 85 in the next few years.&nbsp; Perhaps, taking a page from PM, we should organise grassroots or community outings to Sam Tan's or Lily Neo's wards to convince Singaporeans that this scenario is already happening and is fast becoming a reality in other wards too!&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a gap in understanding which public education can help to address.</p><p><br><p align=left>Column: 1609<p><I>Uncertain payback</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of this House are familiar with the <I>kiasu</I> Singaporean.&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the next objection is the \"<I>pau su</I>\" syndrome, \"Won't I lose out if I die early since the money cannot be handed to my next-of-kin? You mean, my hard earned money will be taken away to benefit a very small pool of people who are fortunate enough to live beyond 85.\"&nbsp; They view this as a \"<I>pau su</I> \"&nbsp;(sure lose) proposition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I surmise that many people hold this view because a large number of Singaporeans still do not buy insurance and are unfamiliar with the concept.&nbsp; Annuities are even less understood as it is reported that last year only 4.1% of CPF members who turned 55 bought annuities with their Minimum Sum.&nbsp; Again, Sir, there is a gap in understanding which calls for an educational campaign on the concept of an annuity, especially among heartlanders, and in a language that they can understand, which I am glad the Ministry will be doing over the next few months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, it would be simpler to explain to the public that whilst buying an annuity is not a \"<I>pau chiah</I>\" (sure win) proposition, it is also not a \"<I>pau su</I>\" case.&nbsp; Rather, it is \"<I>pau ho</I>\" which means \"guaranteed good\", because it gives more bang for the buck for the growing ranks of those who enjoy length of life, and who knows, you just could be one of them!</p><p><br><I>Uncompromising condition</I></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is uncompromising because it is compulsory.&nbsp; And many are unhappy with the compulsory nature of the scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;They argue with great passion that CPF monies are their hard earned money and the Government has no business to<p align=left>Column: 1610<p> dictate how they spend their own money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my&nbsp; younger residents even emailed to me pointing to&nbsp; those who feel that having toiled and contributed taxes when they are young,&nbsp; it would not be&nbsp; too much to ask for a handout from the State&nbsp; if one lives beyond 85 and has no money to live on.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this argument is flawed as the pool of funds is always finite.&nbsp; So there will be trade-offs - either there will be less tax money for other areas like education and health or, as the pool of octogenarians increases, the Government will have to impose higher taxes on the younger working population to support the seniors!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The less well-off are often the ones that are least prepared for retirement, and it is precisely this group that will benefit most from an annuity scheme.&nbsp; Hence, if the system is to cater to people who are less well- off and may not be able to plan for themselves, the amount to be withheld from the Minimum Sum at the age of 65 must be as low as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp; whilst I agree that some flexibility, including opt-outs, should be injected into the system, these should be sparingly and judiciously allowed.&nbsp; I support an annuity scheme with limited opt-out as it ensures that it will have the largest possible risk pool and be able to enjoy the economies of scale needed to yield the lowest premium, thereby benefiting the maximum number of people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, a basic annuity scheme with no inheritance value should you die before the payout age would be the cheapest.&nbsp; So for the masses, we need to aim for a \"<I>ko pih, ko chi</I> \"&nbsp;(cheap and good) basic annuity.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for those who prefer to have an annuity which their next-of-kin could inherit should they pass on before the minimum payout age limit or wish to draw down earlier, they could <p align=left>Column: 1611<p>purchase a rider, which will allow for such outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemptions could also be given, say, for those who have already bought an annuity but on&nbsp;a once-off&nbsp; transitionary&nbsp;provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All others should buy the basic annuity and any riders that may be offered under the scheme to achieve their desired outcomes.&nbsp; This will then minimise the moral hazard of private insurers cherry picking and where the rich, who have purchased their own annuities, can opt out anytime, thus leaving only the poor in the pool.&nbsp; To some extent, we already have experience of this in the ElderShield scheme, which is currently being reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Unattractive payouts</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have noted, as my colleagues before me too,&nbsp;that the indicated payout of $250 or $300 per month is&nbsp;inadequate.&nbsp; In&nbsp; fact,&nbsp; feedback about the inadequacy of the ElderShield payouts, among others, is one of the reasons for its current revamp.&nbsp; Others have expressed reservations about such a scheme being run by private insurers.&nbsp;They feel that as private insurers are profit-oriented entities, the monthly payout would be less attractive as the insurers would have to factor in a decent profit and also take into account all costs incurred.&nbsp; Indeed, many people have asked that the compulsory annuity scheme be administered by the CPF Board instead of private insurers.&nbsp; Hence, I am pleased that the Minister agrees&nbsp;to address these concerns.&nbsp; The annuity scheme could be modelled after the MediShield concept which is implemented by the Health Ministry with private insurers.&nbsp; I understand that this arrangement has worked well for MediShield where the private insurers are required to integrate their enhancement plans with the basic MediShield as one single product.&nbsp; In the same way, the CPF Board could administer the basic annuity scheme,<p align=left>Column: 1612<p> while any enhancement to the scheme is done by private insurers.&nbsp;</p><p><br><I>Deferment of minimum draw-down age and the re-employment legislation</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is coffeeshop talk that the changes to the CPF have been made for the sole purpose of delaying payment on the CPF accounts.&nbsp; Many people are upset that the promise to return them what is essentially their hard earned money at a certain time by the Government keeps getting deferred.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also those who are worried that they may end up in a catch-22 situation where they are unable to get re-employment and yet cannot draw down on their Minimum Sum.&nbsp; Sir, they are saying, in Hokkien, \"<I>Boh reid,&nbsp;boh kang</I>\",&nbsp;that is,&nbsp;\"No money, no job\"&nbsp;- an untenable&nbsp;double jeopardy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have asked the Government to allow those who genuinely cannot get re-employed and need the Minimum Sum payout to start withdrawing earlier.&nbsp; More importantly, they feel that the Government must ensure that the re-employment legislation works before the deferment in the draw-down age starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have thus suggested that the re-employment legislation should kick in earlier before 2012, to ensure its effectiveness before the draw-down age is progressively deferred from 2012.&nbsp; These are genuine concerns and practical difficulties on the ground that the Government should seriously consider. Indeed, I support the call to implement the re-employment legislation earlier to allay the concerns of workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Conclusion</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, over the six years that I have been an MP, I have increasingly seen more elderly residents in their 60s and older who are asking for financial and job <p align=left>Column: 1613<p>assistance.&nbsp; They often say that they have depleted their CPF, have no other savings and their children are unable to support them.&nbsp; In fact, under the CDCs' job database, about 10% of the employees seeking employment are aged 60 and above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, I think it is timely&nbsp; that we take steps to start tackling these challenges now so that our children - yours and mine -&nbsp;and their children, are not left to shoulder the burden.&nbsp; No doubt, this set of measures will need to be refined over time to minimise any moral hazard and administrative failings, but it is a good start.&nbsp;</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It must also be recognised that these changes are by themselves no panacea that will solve all our ageing woes. Other aspects such as devising an affordable healthcare system for the elderly, educating Singaporeans on financial planning and promoting healthy lifestyles and family values would also have to be addressed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the Minister's Statement.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->\t  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\">      \t\t      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.27 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</B> (<I>In Mandarin</I>):&nbsp;[<I>For vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2007/20070917/20070917VS_090730.pdf\"\">Appendix A</a></I> *.]&nbsp; &nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, birth, ageing, illness and death are a natural process of life.&nbsp; But in this process, who should be held responsible and who should provide us with the basic necessities of life?&nbsp; Apart from the parents, the people will think that it is the responsibility of the Government.&nbsp; Our Government leaders also understand the mindset of our people.&nbsp; Therefore, our leaders always try to persuade the people not to overly rely on the Government.&nbsp; I think our Government has slightly changed its approach, that is,<p align=left>Column: 1614<p> to ensure that the people buy longevity insurance when they are still young, during their golden age, maybe 20-30 years old and they start earning money, to make it compulsory for them to buy the longevity insurance.&nbsp; It is not really a bad idea, as this will ensure that these people who are in their 30s, 40s or 50s, or when they grow older, will be able to live comfortably.<p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><BR><hr width=\"50%\">*Cols. 1673-1676.<BR></div></P></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, sometimes, when we are in the coffeeshop, some residents have asked me whether the Government is trying to delay giving us back our CPF monies.&nbsp; They said that by the time they can take back their CPF money, maybe it is time for them to go. I think we should understand this common worry that the people have, and the fear that they will not have a long life to enjoy their monies.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, I try my best to explain to them that having the money but not living long enough to enjoy it, is far better than having none at old age.&nbsp; If they had lived until a very old age, but they have no money, that is even more terrible because, at that time, if their children do not support them, then their life will be more meaningless.&nbsp; So, if they have money, although they cannot live long enough, it is still better than if they live long enough but have no money.&nbsp; Of course, not everyone will agree with this, but what I am trying to tell them is that it is a task for every individual, everybody must take care of his old age and be responsible for his retirement.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, what I am worried about is that when they reach their 60s and 70s, they will have no work.&nbsp; What are they going to do?&nbsp; And who will help them?&nbsp; If they have grown-up children, they will have no problem as their children can earn enough money to help them financially.&nbsp; However, if their children belong to the low-income group, then some problems might arise.&nbsp; Therefore, I hope our Government will also consider the plight of this group of people.</p><p align=left>Column: 1615<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as what has been raised by my colleagues earlier, why is the age set at 85?&nbsp; Is it because the insurance company is telling our Government that we should set at 85, but not 82 or 80?&nbsp; I am raising this because a lot of constituents have asked me this question.&nbsp; Because they cannot believe that they can live until 85 or beyond.&nbsp; This is especially so in my constituency because most of them are in the middle and lower-income groups.&nbsp; They believe that their life is pre-destined. Therefore, they have no confidence to live up to 85 or beyond.&nbsp; So, is it possible that the committee, led by Prof. Lim, consider lowering the Minimum Sum draw-down age, and to consider having a different payout at different ages, for instance, when they reach 85, they can get a higher payout, but if they draw out at 80 years old, they get a lower sum?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, up to now, those middle and lower-income groups who have no work or income depend heavily on the subsidies from our constituencies, ComCare and CCC funds.&nbsp; They have asked us, \"How long can I continue to draw on this fund and the subsidies?\"&nbsp; And we have always explained to them that the Government will not transfer the responsibility to the people.&nbsp; In fact, under the CPF reform scheme, it is, just like what our Minister has said, that the Government has set aside about $120 million for this purpose.&nbsp; In addition, the Government will incur about $110 million every year on employment funds as well as the increased rate of return on CPF funds.&nbsp; So we explain this to them.&nbsp; Our Government would try to help them in various respects.&nbsp; But how long can the Government continue to help them?&nbsp; Nobody can give them a guaranteed answer.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how are we going to answer them?&nbsp; The only answer we can give them is: only when the PAP is in power, we can guarantee that.&nbsp; But if the PAP is no longer in power, we cannot give them<p align=left>Column: 1616<p> that guarantee.&nbsp; Just look around, a lot of leaders in the other countries just pocket the money of the nation.&nbsp; Therefore, we say that so long as the PAP is still in power, we can give them such a guarantee.&nbsp; Those people who do not support the Government say, \"Oh, you are cheating us of our votes.\"&nbsp; But that is the case in reality.&nbsp; In other words, if the PAP is not in power, how can the people continue to expect higher returns from the CPF funds and all kinds of Workfare subsidies and to expect every month and every week, during the Budget session, they can get some subsidies and all kinds of financial help from the ComCare fund, etc?&nbsp; So when our Minister rolls out all these schemes, we hope that the new committee will consider all these points and maybe they should study the scheme further, and allow the people to be given the choice to choose whether they want to draw out at 85, 82 or 80, and how much they can get at 80, 82 or 85 years old.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to praise our Manpower Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen for implementing such a good scheme which is widely acceptable, especially paying attention to those low-income groups with a monthly salary of about $800-$1,500. In fact, the additional 1% interest under the new CPF scheme will benefit all our people and I support and thank him for this new measure.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In 1984, or around that time, we thought that the Minimum Sum scheme would be enough to solve the problem, but it did not do so.&nbsp; In the past, we have been addressing the retirement savings on a piecemeal basis and I am therefore glad that the Prime Minister has finally decided <p align=left>Column: 1617<p>to take a more holistic approach&nbsp;in solving this&nbsp;very difficult issue for Singaporeans.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, however, unfortunate that we have not convinced all Singaporeans with the various schemes that have been announced or spoken about in the past few weeks.&nbsp; The annuity scheme or the longevity insurance scheme has been perceived negatively and it is a pity because we know that this is definitely the missing piece, as what the Minister for Manpower mentioned earlier on.&nbsp; The variable interest rate for part of the CPF savings is also an unpopular move.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the real issue is, and we all know this, that we want to ensure&nbsp;that Singaporeans have enough money to last them their entire retirement years, in fact, the entire lifetime.&nbsp; Where the differences of opinion lie are the extent to which it is believed that the Government should be responsible for helping Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our social compact has been on the basis that retirement must be provided for by the people&nbsp;out of their own savings.&nbsp; The contribution rate that was initially thought to be necessary to provide for people's retirement was set at 50% of the salary to be contributed equally by the employers and employees.&nbsp; This is something that the Government seems to have lost sight of, the 50%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is sad that we face a situation where only one out of three Singaporeans has enough to meet the Minimum Sum criteria upon reaching the age of 62.&nbsp; So, what went wrong with our CPF scheme?&nbsp; The answer is simple.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CPF scheme was used to do too many things.&nbsp; Starting with the real objective of retirement savings when CPF was started, over the years, we made use of the same tool, the CPF, to do too many things, including promoting home ownership and as an economic stimulant.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1618<p> These goals have been pulling the scheme in different directions.&nbsp; Home ownership means less money for retirement savings.&nbsp; Using CPF as an economic tool and cutting employers' contributions to cut business cost similarly meant that there was less money accumulated for retirement savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not saying that these ends were not important.&nbsp; After all, we have today one of the highest home ownership rates in the world.&nbsp; We were also able to recover from the various recessions and the Asian economic crisis by cutting the CPF rates to stimulate the economy.&nbsp; But at the same time, life expectancies have gone up and people will need more, and not less, cash in their CPF.&nbsp; So a simple retirement savings tool became one that was pulled in different directions and in opposing directions at times.&nbsp; So the problem we are seeing today has been brewing for quite a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real solution therefore is to either bump up the CPF savings or the contribution rates to CPF or create a national pension plan and also to reconvert the housing assets into liquid assets.&nbsp; The Prime Minister has therefore rightly envisioned a holistic approach, and I think the proposed plans, if fine-tuned correctly, will go a long way in addressing most of our retirement savings problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first address the proposals for delaying the CPF withdrawals and boosting the Minimum Sum and annuities.&nbsp; Sir, by deferring withdrawals, we create a new problem for people who do not have the necessary Minimum Sum upon reaching the age of 55.&nbsp; They may, as a result,&nbsp;not have enough to see them to the next milestone, which is the age of 62, when they can draw on their Minimum Sum.&nbsp; This delaying will therefore only work if implemented hand-in-hand with the delaying of the retirement age and also protecting the employment of older Singaporeans.&nbsp; Allowing home owners to<p align=left>Column: 1619<p> unlock the value of their homes will also help them during this period.&nbsp; And the proposed annuity scheme then provides for the much later years.&nbsp; So the overall ideas are therefore indeed holistic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me first speak about the proposed annuity scheme.&nbsp; This has been the most negatively perceived thing among all the announcements made.&nbsp; The chief reasons for this are that it is forced, that the benefit may not necessarily accrue to the member (since he may not live past the age of 85),&nbsp;that it is too late to purchase it at the age of 55, and also that the Government is not contributing to this.&nbsp; I think we could have avoided this negative perception if the Government could have fine-tuned the scheme a little.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Effectively, what we really need is a national pension plan, as I mentioned.&nbsp;If we decide to create this national scheme through the annuity system, the contributions through CPF&nbsp;can start at a much earlier age, instead of age 55.&nbsp; In fact, they should start at a time when we start contributing to&nbsp;CPF.&nbsp; It therefore could be much broad-based so that even young people contribute to it.&nbsp; And the asset base will therefore be broader and there will be more time for&nbsp;the funds to be accumulated and grown and therefore there will be a higher payout for all.&nbsp; The amount of contributions&nbsp;will also be lower, and this will therefore&nbsp;be more affordable&nbsp;and every Singaporean will benefit in the later part of their years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the suggestion to limit the payouts at the age of 85 and beyond is of course very unpopular, as many Members have said.&nbsp; Many people think that they will not live that long and so feel that it is taxing them when they are unlikely to benefit from it personally.&nbsp; Starting contributions earlier, as I have suggested, will enable us to structure a programme to provide an annuity from an age that is lower than 85, 70, 75 or 80.&nbsp; We can determine what <p align=left>Column: 1620<p>that age is if we have a bigger sum to play around with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At any cost, we want to avoid the impression being given, ie, that we are taxing everyone, especially the poorer Singaporeans for whom the contributions will be significant when not everyone may benefit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another big objection is that the families of members who do not live beyond 85 would have ended up paying but not benefiting anything.&nbsp; The scheme should therefore be modelled to return all or, at least, some part of the amount paid to family members, if they do not cross the age of 85 years.&nbsp; This amount, while small to the higher-income Singaporeans, is significant to the lower-income people and it will be important for their families.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we should also take the opportunity to cover even those who fall through the cracks.&nbsp; If we agree to make this into a national pension plan, we can make this plan a catch-all, so that it benefits and also covers those older Singaporeans who fall within the ad hoc employment category who have not been regular CPF contributors.&nbsp; These persons are presently a worry because they do not have enough savings generally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see that a well-funded, well-planned scheme will make people feel more secure about their retirement.&nbsp; It is crucial to the scheme's acceptability that it does not impose too high a burden on the public.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep the scheme affordable, it may therefore be necessary for the Government to step in as a contributor to support the scheme.&nbsp; I feel that the Government is more than capable to help fund such a scheme.&nbsp; We regularly give back to Singaporeans through schemes like the Progress Package or New Singapore Shares.&nbsp; These go to even those who do not need it every time we do it.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 1621<p> For the important national objective of funding retirement of Singaporeans, we should therefore not shy away from using part of our surplus or even part of our reserves to fund the national pension scheme.&nbsp; We have generated a critical mass of reserves already, and the amount needed for contribution to the national pension plan will not leave a big dent to our overall reserves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current perception is that the Government will be taxing every Singaporean to support those who live beyond 85 years of age.&nbsp; I therefore feel that the Government should take some responsibility for funding the annuity scheme and not leave the full burden to Singaporeans alone.&nbsp; What I am asking is for the Government to co-pay or partially underwrite the scheme.&nbsp; It can be part of a new social compact for the future where every stakeholder contributes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This shift in the social compact is necessary.&nbsp; After all, if we palm off the responsibility for old age to individuals, and leave it to the market, then the Government is saying that it has no role in this except to set up the system for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am, therefore, quite happy to note that the Minister is willing to make this scheme flexible, and we eagerly await the details once they are announced and, hopefully, some of these issues will be addressed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I now turn to the proposal to alter the interest rates payable on the CPF savings.&nbsp; I think the move to offer a higher interest rate on part of the savings is a good one that members will appreciate.&nbsp; I am, however, not convinced of the need to allow the interest rate on the remaining sums to float.&nbsp; This change will likely result in people actually earning less overall in interest than they do at present.&nbsp; Therefore, there is no good<p align=left>Column: 1622<p> reason to inflict this on them at this stage.&nbsp; This is particularly for those who have much higher savings in their CPF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's argument is that in the long term, a time may come when the floating interest rates members earn on the remaining sums may be higher than what is currently being given by the CPF Board.&nbsp; However, I think that members may well be willing to trade off that possible future upside in returns for a guaranteed fixed rate that allows their savings to increase.&nbsp; That certainty would, I think, be more in line with the objective of a retirement fund than to think of getting much&nbsp;higher returns.&nbsp; I feel that the Government can afford to pay higher interest on all the CPF savings, in light of the recent data released by Temasek Holdings showing them earning an annualised return of 18% since inception.&nbsp; I believe that is about the range of data that they released.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes we are making to address&nbsp;retirement savings are critical.&nbsp; The Government cannot afford to lose any goodwill&nbsp;unnecessarily by creating doubts about the future returns on CPF savings.&nbsp; I just cannot see the need to introduce the variable interest rate system at this point of time.&nbsp; This will only undermine the credibility of the other restructuring measures that we are putting in place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, delaying retirement is a reality that we have to face, so it is good that we have chosen to bite the bullet early.&nbsp; The Government should lead the way by hiring older workers, as&nbsp;many Members have said.&nbsp; But for this to really work, we will need an effective legislation which will require employers to keep employing older workers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will definitely need to find a way to support the employers.&nbsp; They may want to keep their older staff, but it may not be viable for them to operate on thin margins.&nbsp; The Workfare Income Supple-<p align=left>Column: 1623<p>ment changes announced today will therefore go a long way to help companies on the margin so that even if they need to rationalise their staff costs with their productivity by paying older workers a lower wage, it is still a viable option for them to keep these older workers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion, I applaud the frank admission that we need to fix the issue of retirement savings.&nbsp; While there are concerns over some of the proposals, I think it is possible to fine-tune them.&nbsp; If done correctly, this Government and this House would have made a significant contribution towards the future of Singapore.&nbsp; All the announcements made by the Minister today and by the Prime Minister, the holistic approach that I have talked about&nbsp;will, I think,&nbsp;solve our problems once and for all, and&nbsp;we should all support these moves.</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah)--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.50 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Holland-Bukit Timah):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I welcome the bold moves by the Government to push ahead with further reforms to improve our retirement adequacy and to encourage our people to work longer.&nbsp; Allow me to first focus on the changes to the CPF interest rate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the CPF Act, the CPF Board pays a minimum interest of 2.5% per annum for the Ordinary Account (OA)&nbsp;when the CPF interest formula yields a lower rate, which is the case in the present situation. &nbsp;The formula is based on the 12-month fixed deposit and the month-end saving rates of the major local banks.&nbsp; The SMRA accounts would earn additional interests of 1.5% above the OA rate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been extensive debate within and outside this House as to whether this is a fair return.&nbsp; CPF members would obviously want a higher<p align=left>Column: 1624<p> return while the CPF Board would have to satisfy itself whether the interest paid is sustainable in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 1% bonus interest for the first $60,000 in the CPF combined accounts is certainly welcomed.&nbsp; The targeted approach, with a cap of $60,000, makes sense as we want the extra budget resource to be channelled to the lower and middle-income Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But can the Board pay more?&nbsp; It is timely in the midst of this debate that we examine the basis on which the Board pays the interests. &nbsp;This is also the subject of discussion in the dialogue sessions with my grassroots leaders and residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;Minister for Manpower has said earlier that the Ordinary Account is a withdrawal-on-demand account and therefore interest should be pegged to a fixed deposit and savings rate.&nbsp; It may well be a withdrawal-on-demand account for the purpose of CPFIS or for the purchase of property.&nbsp; But it is certainly not withdrawal-on-demand for&nbsp;members' other liquidity needs, such as to pay for a large unexpected expense, or can be tapped upon for GIRO payments.&nbsp; Members would only get to see their savings at the age of 55, after setting aside the Minimum Sum.&nbsp; Depending on the investment strategies of CPF, a significant portion of the funds would have been invested for a longer horizon, ie, greater than 12 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, for a compulsory savings scheme, it can be argued that to give up this flexibility and liquidity for their savings, members deserve more than a 1-year deposit or savings rate return.&nbsp; Moreover, savings rates tend to be much lower than the deposit rates, and I suspect it is the reason why the weighted rate has been staying below the 2.5% floor rate for many years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that the CPF also explore other benchmarks to peg the OA rate, such as the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate <p align=left>Column: 1625<p>(SIBOR), which is a more transparent market benchmark.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must, however, also credit the Government for keeping a floor rate of 2.5% for the OA, as this is of some intrinsic value to members, especially in times of low deposit rates.&nbsp; I hope that the Government will continue to keep the floor as a key pillar of the risk-free framework.&nbsp; It is essential for a national pension scheme to have that risk-free framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all fairness, we should also recognise that the CPF savings earn a Government-guaranteed risk-free return while the returns from bank deposits tend to be of slightly lower ratings. &nbsp;The comparables would be the Treasury Bills or&nbsp;Singapore Government Securities, which do yield above the 2.5% from time to time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the problem of tinkering with the CPF OA rates.&nbsp; Under the current scheme of things, the HDB concessionary loan is pegged to the CPF rate.&nbsp; Hence, a higher CPF OA rate would end up raising the HDB loan rates and thereby increasing the interest burden for the first-time HDB home buyers.&nbsp; So I am glad that Government has kept the HDB concessionary loan rate unchanged even with the additional 1% bonus interest.&nbsp; However, going forward, I hope that the Government can look at de-linking the two as the transfer pricing may be seen as unfair to one side.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given this prospect that the OA rate is unlikely to rise much any further, CPF would need to facilitate and make CPFIS even less cumbersome so that members can have the option to seek higher returns elsewhere.&nbsp; It should be made simple and worthwhile even for members with small OA balances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1626<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a national savings scheme, I feel that CPF could play a more active role to strengthen the financial security of the members. &nbsp;CPF should be more than a gate-keeper in screening investment products but also play a more direct role educating the public on investment risks, the principle of \"no free lunch\", the need to diversify, and the use of insurance to manage risk.&nbsp; I join the many who have called on the CPF to play the aggregator role to place the members' funds out for investments.&nbsp; Besides the benefits of economies of scale, CPF can value-add by offering its members various investment plans that offer different risk-return profiles.&nbsp; The members would then choose the investment plans based on their individual risk appetite and, thereafter, live with the outcomes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the SMRA, I welcome the Minister's announcement to peg the return to a 10-year bond rate plus 1%.&nbsp; From a comparable risk-return standpoint, many would agree that the minimum 4% that the CPF Board pays&nbsp;is attractive.&nbsp; Hence, I was initially a little disappointed that the Government has decided to do away with 4% or the 1.5% over CPF rate, and going forward would be pegged to a long-term bond yield.&nbsp; A colleague of mine actually said that the 4% is too good to last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But having heard the Minister's announcement a while ago on the new peg, I think the new scheme looks fairly attractive as well.&nbsp; The 1% mark-up, added on to the 10-year&nbsp;bond yield to project a 30-year yield, looks reasonable, given the flat Singapore interest rate yield curve.&nbsp; The 10-year bond is also well traded and, using the one-year average daily yields for the computation, should smoothen out the volatility. As the bond market develops over the years, I hope the Government will also review the other tenures of the bond to be included in the benchmark, perhaps with different <p align=left>Column: 1627<p>weightings.&nbsp; That would make the benchmark more representative.&nbsp; Having a floating benchmark is good as well, as the bond yield tends to move along with the inflation rate,&nbsp;so maintaining&nbsp;the purchasing power of the savings in the CPF.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I welcome the Minister's assurance also to hold the 4% floor for two years.&nbsp; All in all, I would say that the new scheme is still fairly generous.&nbsp; Unlike the OA funds where members withdraw at the age of 55 and can use the money at their own free will, funds from the SA, which are meant to take care of members' financial security from 65 to 85, should have a more steady return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fundamentally, I cannot disagree with the principle of pegging the returns of SA to a long-term bond yield.&nbsp; In terms of tenures, it is a better match, as the SA funds are also meant for long term.&nbsp; Both the CPF funds and&nbsp;Government bonds are also risk-free, and such market-determined returns are more sustainable to the Government in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the issue of compulsory annuities scheme, we have heard the strong ground reactions, as expressed by many&nbsp;Members in the House.&nbsp; Much has been said.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans take issue with the scheme being made compulsory.&nbsp; Are we too trigger-happy to make this scheme compulsory?&nbsp; For argument's sake, one may think that the MediShield coverage, for example, may be of&nbsp;a more immediate need and, therefore, have a stronger reason to be made compulsory than the annuities scheme which pays interest only after 85 years of age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps, a more palatable way to implement this would be to repackage our 1% bonus interest for the $60,000 in such a way that, for example, the 0.25% of the 1% can be used to pay for the longevity insurance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1628<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the Government is not rushing into the scheme and would form a committee to consult widely on the structure of the scheme, and that the compulsory annuities are for those who are now below 50 years old.&nbsp; Indeed, this is not something we need to turn around in a few months or even in a year.&nbsp; In the meantime, we should encourage more Singaporeans to voluntarily sign up, including many housewives and the self-employed, who may have no CPF or low CPF.&nbsp; We should allow top-ups from relative's CPF accounts to buy such annuities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do believe that a lifelong annuity is the way to tackle the longevity risks.&nbsp; One of my grassroots leaders likens it to a compulsory lottery. &nbsp;It is like&nbsp;buying Toto.&nbsp; You&nbsp;throw in the money into the pool and at the end of the day somebody would strike the number and take the money from the pool, which belongs to everyone else.&nbsp; In this case, the lucky number is 85, of course.&nbsp; He said that if you live beyond 85, it is as good as striking lottery and you get the payout.&nbsp; Of course, the chances of striking a lottery at 85 is a lot higher and increase by the year.&nbsp; So I would prefer to see the compulsory annuities as a hedge against the big unknown, ie, whether you will live beyond 85.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While many countries have already started annuities scheme and some, like Switzerland, are doing it as a compulsory scheme, the annuity concept is new in Singapore. &nbsp;Singaporeans need some time to better understand the concept and would need more details, such as the amount of the premium and the payout, to be convinced.&nbsp; I believe, over time, and with more details made known, many would see the benefit and even be prepared to buy more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a society, we should increasingly move towards allowing for choices and individuality where possible.&nbsp; We should<p align=left>Column: 1629<p> try to keep as few things compulsory as possible.&nbsp; We already have a national compulsory&nbsp;savings scheme that takes care of our citizens' needs up to 85 years of age.&nbsp; Beyond 85, let us give education and persuasion a chance and at the same time strengthen the family values as a second line of support for a secure retirement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the significant airing of this issue of longevity risk, following PM's National Day Rally speech, has raised the awareness of the problems and would get Singaporeans better prepared for old age and better prepared to live longer.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

The issue of retirement planning is one that is close to my heart.&nbsp; In fact, in Clementi, it&nbsp;is a mature estate and this is a much talked about topic at coffeeshops and void decks in the division.&nbsp; It is apt that we should be thinking hard to help Singaporeans build their CPF nest-egg to ensure that they live their retirement years with dignity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the CPF fine-tuning reflects a long-term assessment by our Government of the needs of Singaporeans.&nbsp; It is a far-sighted move because we know that there is an impending bubble building up.&nbsp; Let us face it - the data speaks for itself.&nbsp; The media published information that in 10 years' time, about 60,000 Singaporeans will turn 62 years old, almost double what it is today.&nbsp; About half,&nbsp;or 30,000, or perhaps, even more, will live beyond 85. With the Minimum Sum, you will have a steady income for 20 years.&nbsp; What less the Minimum Sum, the payout will run out earlier. So the scenario that presents itself is this.&nbsp; How to prevent<p align=left>Column: 1630<p> Singaporeans from running out of cash during their retirement?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, family support is important but we are not going to have so many younger Singaporeans to take care of the older ones.&nbsp; One can only imagine the kind of pressure on the economic contributors and the Government of the day when our very own children and grandchildren will have to confront the enormity of supporting and caring for so many seniors 10-30 years down the road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How would those seniors help care for themselves then?&nbsp; The question we ask ourselves could then be phrased as: what can we do today to help the retirees in 10-20 years' time&nbsp;lighten the load on a future working generation in caring for the aged in their time?&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;tough question and today, we have heard the steps proposed by the Minister.&nbsp; I know many of my colleagues here will remember the years during the Asian financial crisis,&nbsp;9/11, SARS, but we have to roll with the punches.&nbsp; We have not been afraid to make tough decisions when we had to. Today, we are discussing further refinements to the CPF, and we should forge ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; Sir, the first thing that came up regularly during my conversations with my constituents was this.&nbsp; Many are still unclear about the terms of the refinement and I hope after today, they will be a little bit clearer.&nbsp; Let me give you an example. One resident, Mr Tan, in his early 50s, came to me mortified. He had heard about the CPF changes and he&nbsp;was very upset.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he thought he would not be able to withdraw from his CPF until 65.&nbsp; Worse still, for him, he thought the retirement age was to be reviewed with immediate effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I can tell you that he was much relieved when I assured him that our Government did not intend to do anything so drastic.&nbsp; He was happy to learn that the plans outlined will be put in place in a<p align=left>Column: 1631<p> phased manner, that the retirement age has not changed, and that we will make employers provide re-employment opportunities available for those who work beyond 62,&nbsp;to 65, and then to 67.&nbsp; Mr Tan was most pleased that the Government did not have any intention of preventing him from withdrawing some money from his CPF when he reaches 55, as long as the Minimum Sum criterion is fulfilled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I hope that we can have a comprehensive plan to communicate to Singaporeans about the details of the CPF refinement. Given that many who are retiring in the next few years are still some of the lower educated seniors,&nbsp;the fine-tuning should be simple to understand.&nbsp; Otherwise, we will have many more unhappy Singaporeans. When the intent is certainly good, why let Singaporeans begin to doubt the sincerity of this Government?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, on the increase in the rate of return and the&nbsp;tying of the returns for all accounts, other than the OA, to the long-term bond yield. The increase of the 1% on the rate of return is indeed welcome news for many Singaporeans.&nbsp; Many insurance and financial industry professionals have engaged with the media to work out the sums to demonstrate what the impact will be for Singaporeans as a result of the rate increase.&nbsp; For those who have this amount, the better returns will more than pay for their annuity premiums due when they reach the DDA. This needs to be communicated better.&nbsp; While many Singaporeans will no doubt benefit from this gracious move, it should be noted that some lower income Singaporeans do not have $60,000 in the combined accounts within the CPF. For many Singaporeans, after using their CPF funds to pay for housing, they are left with little in their CPF OAs.&nbsp; For this group who are the ones who need it most, how can we help them enjoy the benefits of this rate increase so that they can have a larger retirement nest-egg?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1632<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is a thorny issue.&nbsp; A significant proportion of Singaporeans -&nbsp;the sick, poor or unemployed -&nbsp;they are the ones who are possibly left out by the increase in the rate of&nbsp;return proposal,&nbsp;while the rest of Singaporeans generally feel that they can take care of themselves.&nbsp; On linking the rate of return for the Special Account, Retirement Account and Medisave to a long-term bond rate, this is probably where the most concern has surfaced from the ground.&nbsp; These accounts currently enjoy a 4% rate of return.&nbsp; In&nbsp;the current environment, with the low interest rates, we have heard from the Minister that in the short-term, we may not be able to provide a rate of return to match this. Sir, I am happy to hear that the SMRA will be pegged to the 10-year SGS plus 1%.&nbsp; I am happy not just because the Minister had given us the reasons, citing the 30-year and the 10-year rate differential, but due to the current interest rate situation. The current 10-year bond yield is actually at 2.73%.&nbsp; The positive impact on the retirement income is therefore going to be lower if the interest rate environment persists.&nbsp; In fact, some quarters suggest to the media that it may not be a short-term blip, but lower than 4% returns may prove to be&nbsp; much more enduring.&nbsp; This will directly impact the size of the nest-egg available for retirement.&nbsp; We may have a bigger retirement problem than before.&nbsp; So I am therefore making a call to the Minister to consider a permanent floor of, say, 3.5% after the two years instead of leaving it at 2.5%.&nbsp; In the long run, if the interest rate environment changes, then we may see better returns.&nbsp; But&nbsp;a sense of uncertainty still prevails.&nbsp; Many Singaporeans are not convinced that this is a better move because they do not have&nbsp;a decent guaranteed rate of return.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the upside, of course, when the bond returns are higher than the floor limits set, then let it be a bonus for the CPF members. So pegging the 10-year&nbsp;SGS plus 1% shows that the Government<p align=left>Column: 1633<p> is aware of the interest rate environment and will also silence those who think this tweaking exercise also reduces the borrowing cost from the CPF pool.&nbsp; Instead, it will show the sincerity and the refinement would be&nbsp;that much more palatable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are doing all we can to keep Singaporeans employed between the critical age of 55&nbsp;and 62 years and, subsequently, more workers to work beyond 62.&nbsp; The additional years of employment will add significantly to the retirement funds.&nbsp; However, I hope that we can still help those who are not able to work. For some, the proposed compulsory annuity is causing some unhappiness because they do not have the funds for the premiums in the first place. They feel that they are being forced to plan for the future when their needs are simply put much more immediate.&nbsp; It is here and now not having enough for today, something that Dr Lim Wee Kiak, my hon. colleague, had addressed in his speech earlier.&nbsp; To compound the unhappiness, many do not adequately understand what risk-pooling means and why it should be a part of it.&nbsp; Why should their premiums benefit others if they pass on before they reach 85, or&nbsp;that they only live maybe a year or two past 85?&nbsp; Will not those funds they use to pay the premiums better serve their immediate families when they die? This type of concern&nbsp;is the hardest to address and I hope that we can think of ways to allow some - the terminally ill or those adequately covered - to opt out of the annuity scheme.&nbsp; It looks like more time will need to be spent on getting Singaporeans to buy into this compulsory annuity plan. And I hope that we could work with more insurers to come up with perhaps riders that kick in only at 85.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 1634<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, these are the main concerns that have come up as a response to the refinements proposed by the Government.&nbsp; The CPF refinements are necessary.&nbsp; By doing this, we are preserving our social compact between the Government and&nbsp;the people. However, during the process of refining the CPF, perhaps some small adjustments to take in the feedback of Singaporeans can be done.&nbsp; I am confident that with these refinements, we will be in better shape to stem the&nbsp;retirement needs of Singaporeans in 10-20 years' time.&nbsp; It is our responsibility to do this now. Failing to do so, failing to plan forward, will tantamount to squandering away all the achievements that this Government and the people of Singapore have obtained these many years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support the reforms to the CPF.</p></P></span></div>\t\t\t\t</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\t<!--SECTION_NAME:MOTIONS-->      \t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE--><p align=left>Column: 1634<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE:::1634--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ADJOURNMENT OF DEBATE<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"That the debate be now adjourned.\" - [Mr Lim Swee Say].<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> Resumption of debate, what day?</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Swee Say:</B> Tomorrow, Sir.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Deputy Speaker:</B> So be it.</P></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:ADJOURNMENT--><p align=left>Column: 1634<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:ADJOURNMENT:::1635--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>ADJOURNMENT<BR></B></span><div><BR>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t </span></div> \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Swee Say--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resolved,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Lim Swee Say].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at</p><p align=\"right\">Five&nbsp;Minutes past&nbsp;Seven o'clock pm.<br></p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->\t<html><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\" />  \t<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->  \t<HEAD>\t<META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-Type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">  \t</HEAD>   \t<body bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" link=\"#0033CC\" vlink=\"#0033CC\" alink=\"0000FF\"><p align=left>Column: 1635<p><!--SECTION_NAME:WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B><P>WRITTEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL ANSWER NOT <BR>ANSWERED BY 3.00 PM</P></span></B></div>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:MALAY/MUSLIM DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES AND TEENAGE PREGNANCIES--><p align=left>Column: 1635<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:MALAY/MUSLIM DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES AND TEENAGE PREGNANCIES:::1638--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>MALAY/MUSLIM DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES AND TEENAGE PREGNANCIES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Steps to mitigate--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Steps to mitigate)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Chiam See Tong--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Chiam See Tong </B>asked the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports what steps the Government is taking to mitigate the problem of Malay/Muslim dysfunctional families and teenage pregnancies.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Chiam, we are concerned about the impact of Malay/Muslim dysfunctional families and teenage pregnancies on the affected individuals, families and future generations.&nbsp; As PM said at Mendaki's 25th Anniversary Dinner and Awards Presentation, the community needs to make a major effort to focus on the problem and work out practical and effective solutions.&nbsp; It is hard for the Government to actively intervene without being misunderstood, or without triggering a defensive reaction.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Malay/Muslim community, led by the Community Leaders Forum (CLF) and Mendaki, have recognised the problems, and taken a two-pronged approach in response:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Firstly, assistance programmes targeted directly at vulnerable and dysfunctional families.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;Secondly, broad-based programmes that aim to prevent teenage pregnancies, strengthen marriages, and help needy families to break out of poverty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government's approach is to work with the community and support their efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Dysfunctional families</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young couples (below 21 years) face a higher possibility of dysfunctionality as they are twice as likely to divorce.&nbsp; Targeted programmes such as INSPIRASI hubs have been set up to help such couples make informed decisions about marrying young and support those who marry.&nbsp; They are run by the Young Women Muslim Association and the Association of Muslim Professionals, with MCYS funding support. Couples who face marital problems can seek counselling from Syariah Court and its partners in the community.&nbsp; These measures complement the Government's nation-wide schemes such as the Healthy Start Programme, which aims to help at-risk children in dysfunctional families through case work and support for pre-school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the key broad-based programmes include MUIS' Empowerment Partnership Scheme to help families out of poverty and be self-reliant.&nbsp; The scheme provides financial assistance, as well as skills upgrading and counselling.&nbsp; The CLF has also initiated social enterprise projects to help more women to be economically active.&nbsp; The projects are supported by the ComCare Enterprise Fund.&nbsp; Low-income families who need more support can turn to the Family Excellence Circles formed by Mendaki.&nbsp; These Circles are support groups that help families with their children's learning.&nbsp; Low-income families can also benefit from the Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) scheme, which provides up to<p align=left>Column: 1637<p> $100,000 for each family, to help them keep the family size manageable, so that they can better focus their resources on their children and break out of poverty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Teenage pregnancies</I></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CLF has also initiated several targeted programmes to address teenage sexuality.&nbsp; Troubled youths who need someone to talk to can call the NURteensLINE or visit the NUR Drop-in Centres.&nbsp; Both projects are funded by the ComCare Social Support Projects Fund.&nbsp; The Pertapis sheltered home on the other hand helps unmarried pregnant teenagers make better choices for themselves and their babies.&nbsp; Parents who need help to enhance their parent-teenager communication can benefit from the <I>Dari Hati Ke Hati</I> interactive workshops by CLF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CLF has also been leading efforts for greater public awareness on teenage sexuality.&nbsp; It launched the \"It's Sexier to Say 'No'!\" initiative to create awareness on the rising trend in teenage sexuality.&nbsp; This has been complemented by the popular TV series Hanyut and SEKSa by MCYS and MediaCorp TV Suria.&nbsp; The TV programmes have helped parents to connect with their children on important issues, including teenage sexuality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the CLF initiated the (a) Youth-In-Action and Youth-In-Action Plus and (b) Max-Out Programme to help keep students in school and help&nbsp;out-of-school youths be gainfully employed.&nbsp; Through <I>Projek Menggapai Sinaran</I>, a partnership between MCYS and the Singapore Malay Teachers Union, in-school youths are given guidance on sexuality and other challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our mosques have also developed programmes that reach out to youth and address sexuality education.&nbsp; One example is the programme called aL.I.V.E (Learning Islamic Values Everyday).&nbsp; MUIS is working to strengthen this further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although there are significant efforts on-going, the community recognises the need to do more.&nbsp; The existing programmes are relatively new and need to be sustained to show results.&nbsp; Mendaki and CLF will mobilise more partners to come forward, and also facilitate the development of more creative and effective ways to address the issues.&nbsp; These will be discussed at the coming Community Leaders Forum towards the end of this year. The Government will continue to support these efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:EN-BLOC SALES--><p align=left>Column: 1637<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:EN-BLOC SALES:::1640--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>EN-BLOC SALES</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Government agencies' ability to cope with increased demands--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Government agencies' ability to cope with increased demands)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Gautam Banerjee </B>asked the Minister for National Development in view of the significant increase in en bloc sales, whether Government agencies such as the Strata Titles Board are able to cope with the increased demands being made of them and maintain service levels and response times for applications and appeals from the public.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Mah Bow Tan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 92(9) of the Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act provides that a strata title board shall make a final order or determination within&nbsp;six months from the date it is constituted.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first&nbsp;eight months of 2007, the Strata Titles Boards (or STB) received a total of 60 applications relating to en bloc sales, compared with 43 applications <p align=left>Column: 1639<p>received in the whole of 2006.&nbsp; Of the applications received this year, 32 had been concluded and these were done within&nbsp;five months.&nbsp; Only one exceptional case had to be extended as an earlier date for the hearing could not be scheduled as the Counsels for both the applicants and respondents were involved in other matters in the Courts.&nbsp; The remaining applications were received in the recent few months and are being processed.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill, which will be read the Second time in Parliament this afternoon, will seek to increase the number of Deputy Presidents and panel members that can be appointed to the STB.&nbsp; This will allow more boards to be constituted to deal with applications even more expeditiously.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:RE-EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION--><p align=left>Column: 1639<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:RE-EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION:::1640--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>RE-EMPLOYMENT LEGISLATION</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Coverage of employees in uniformed services--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Coverage of employees in uniformed services)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mrs Josephine Teo--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mrs Josephine Teo </B>asked the Minister for Manpower if the proposed re-employment legislation is intended to cover employees in the uniformed services.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employees in the uniformed services are exempted from the Retirement Age Act due to the physical demands and hazardous nature of the jobs.

This is based on our assessment that it would be good for Singapore if the IDR develops and takes off successfully. A thriving and dynamic South Johor region next to Singapore will generate greater opportunities and attract more talent and ideas to this part of the world.&nbsp; This will be good for both countries.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The JMC on IDR cooperation is co-chaired by Minister (National Development) Mah Bow Tan and Malaysia's Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Dato' Sri Effendi Norwawi. Other members include Minister (Transport) Raymond Lim and the Chief Minister of Johor, Dato' Abdul Ghani Othman. At the JMC's inaugural meeting in July 2007, four work groups were set up to explore cooperation in the areas of immigration, transport, tourism and the environment. The JMC will be meeting again later in the year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst the two governments can encourage and help facilitate economic cooperation and linkages, the private sector must make their own investment decisions based on commercial considerations.

With East Asia growing rapidly, there are many investment opportunities in Malaysia and other countries. As the IDR develops, our private sector, like all other investors, will make their own assessments of the relative attractiveness of the IDR vis-&agrave;-vis other investment opportunities and act accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understand that there is interest amongst our companies to participate in the development and growth of the IDR and they are carrying out their ground assessments.

As some events organised for the primary schools differ from those <p align=left>Column: 1651<p>organised for the secondary schools, junior colleges and centralised institutes,&nbsp;the cost for running SYF for the different levels differ as well.&nbsp; The average budget for the last three primary level SYF was about $930,000 while the average budget for the last three secondary, junior college, centralised institute level SYF was about $502,000.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The SYF plays an important role in promoting the development of the arts in our schools. Its objectives are to encourage mass participation in performing arts CCAs, promote the growth of an arts culture in our schools and raising standards in arts education. The SYF also showcases the diverse talents of our students in the arts.&nbsp; The SYF is a two-step process each year. In April, the central judging benchmarks the standards of performing arts groups in schools by assessing them in&nbsp;six categories: band, Chinese orchestra, choir, dance, drama and instrumental ensembles. Schools that do well in each category are then selected and showcased in the festival in July.&nbsp; Each year, more than 20 events are staged under SYF and the performances reach out to ticketed audience at formal concert halls as well as members of the public at shopping centres and parks.&nbsp; The SYF also showcases students in track&nbsp;and field and UG events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The success of the SYF is measured based on a broad set of deliverables. The deliverables are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;% of schools that participated in the annual SYF events</p><p></p><p>&bull;&nbsp;Trend data on participation rates by levels (primary, secondary,&nbsp;JC)<br></p><p></p><p>&bull;&nbsp;Trend data on Overall Award Distribution for SYF Central Judging<br></p><p>&bull;&nbsp;Number of schools attaining Sustained Achievement Award (Aesthetics)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Trend study on the participation rates by levels (primary, secondary and JC) over the last&nbsp;six years shows a positive trend of students participating in the SYF Central Judging. The increase for each festival over the preceding festival for the level has been between 9% and 27%.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools have also performed better in the annual SYF Central Judging. Trend study on the overall award distribution for SYF Central Judging from 2002-2007 also shows a higher percentage of items attaining at least a Silver Award in this benchmarking platform. In the 2007 SYF, 70% of items attained at least a Silver Award.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an increasing number of schools attaining the Sustained Achievement Award for Aesthetics from 2002-2007.&nbsp; In 2002, 10 schools were awarded the Sustained Achievement Award for Aesthetics while in 2006, 26 institutions received the same award.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest testimony of the achievement and success of SYF is the vibrant performing arts scene in schools, which in turn builds a strong audience and performer base for the arts in Singapore. Today, there are a total of 1,018 performing groups of various kinds in our secondary schools and JCs and 745 in primary schools. In 2006-2007, 97.7% of all primary schools, 98.8% of all secondary schools and 90% of all junior colleges/centralised institute participated in at least one of the SYF platforms.</p></p></span>\t\t<div align=center><span style=\\\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\\\"><B>\t\t<!--TITLE_NAME:SINGAPORE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA--><p align=left>Column: 1653<p><!--END_COL_TITLE:SINGAPORE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA:::1654--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><P>SINGAPORE NATIONAL YOUTH ORCHESTRA</P></span><!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Annual budget and measure of performance--><div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>(Annual budget and measure of performance)</B></span><div><BR>\t\t</B></span></div>\t\t<div align=left>\t\t<P><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;\t        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Baey Yam Keng--><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>Mr Baey Yam Keng </B>asked the Minister for Education (a) what is the annual budget for the Singapore National Youth Orchestra for the last five years; and (b) how is its performance measured.</P></span>                <span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average annual budget for the Singapore National Youth Orchestra (SNYO) for the last&nbsp;five years (FY 2003-2007) was approximately $420,000.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 200-strong SNYO aims to provide each member with an exemplary orchestral experience and the highest quality professional music education and training, as part of their education. Another objective of the SNYO is to develop future musicians and audience. As such, the main measures of performance relate to their musicianship development through mentorship by practising musicians, and their performances. The SNYO performs&nbsp;three public concerts a year.&nbsp; Every year, the SNYO members also perform with artistes of international repute under the auspices of the International Artistes Series. Concert tours are arranged once every&nbsp;three years during which the SNYO takes part in international festivals or competitions.&nbsp; Such experiences further hone members' performance skills and broaden their musical experiences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the SNYO has won accolades in international music festivals or competitions.&nbsp; During their overseas tour in 2005, the SNYO participated in the 34th International Youth and Music Festival held in Vienna, Austria, and was awarded a joint first with PRC.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, some SNYO members have become musicians themselves.
