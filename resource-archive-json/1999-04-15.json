Sir, first, let me give a\r\n\r\nquick  summary of what happened.  Following the outbreak of  the\r\n\r\nJapanese  Encephalitis (JE) in Malaysia, the Primary  Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  (PPD) monitored the situation closely  and  kept  in\r\n\r\nclose contact with their counterparts in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the situation deteriorated in Malaysia, PPD\r\n\r\nprogressively  took  additional  measures.   PPD   carried   out\r\n\r\nserological surveys on imported pigs to confirm that  there  was\r\n\r\nno  active  JE  infection  in imported pigs.   Mosquito  control\r\n\r\nmeasures were intensified.  Abattoir workers were advised to  be\r\n\r\nvaccinated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was reported that a Hendra-like virus has been\r\n\r\nisolated from human cases in Malaysia, PPD stopped the import of\r\n\r\nall  pigs  from Malaysia and closed our abattoirs.  As an  added\r\n\r\nprecaution, PPD also banned the import of dogs, cats, horses and\r\n\r\nother  mammals from Malaysia.  These measures are still in place\r\n\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PPD and other agencies in the Ministries of the Environment\r\n\r\nand  Health  are  still closely monitoring the  situation.   The\r\n\r\nmeasures  put in place have been effective in not only  ensuring\r\n\r\nthat JE did not occur in Singapore but also that the outbreak of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe previously unknown Hendra-like virus has been contained.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me touch on the impact of the ban. The ban on\r\n\r\nthe  import  of  live  pigs  into  Singapore  has  affected  the\r\n\r\nfollowing groups of people directly:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. 22 live pig importers;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. 759 pork stallholders (647 pork stallholders in\r\n\r\nmarkets managed by HDB, and another 112 by ENV);\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. 98 meat processing plants licensed by PPD. These\r\n\r\nplants, employing about 860 workers, are involved in the cutting\r\n\r\nand  deboning  of  pork, meat roasting and the manufacturing  of\r\n\r\nChinese and Taiwanese sausages, and sweet meat (bak kua); and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iv 75 food factory tenants in HDB industrial estates. 11\r\n\r\nof these are meat processing plants licensed by PPD.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist those directly affected by the ban and with\r\n\r\nlittle recourse to substitutes, both HDB and ENV have waived the\r\n\r\nrent  for pork stalls in HDB and ENV markets for one month.   As\r\n\r\nfor  the 75 food factory tenants, they either received a  waiver\r\n\r\nof  one-month rent or a half-a-month (if they are not completely\r\n\r\ndependent  on  fresh pork supplies), and one month  service  and\r\n\r\nconservancy charges given by the PAP Town Councils.    Both  HDB\r\n\r\nand  ENV would review the concessions given towards the  end  of\r\n\r\nthe  one-month  rent free period and may extend the  waiver,  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the resumption of live pig imports, we will\r\n\r\nonly  allow it when we are certain and confident that  they  are\r\n\r\nsafe for the Singaporean public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When pigs can be imported from Malaysia will depend on how\r\n\r\nsuccessfully the current disease outbreak is controlled.  We\r\n\r\nwill resume imports from Johor only when the area can be\r\n\r\ndeclared to be a disease-free zone according to international\r\n\r\nstandards.  We do not foresee this taking place in the immediate\r\n\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pig farms in Pulau Bulan, Indonesia, were not affected\r\n\r\nby  the JE or Hendra-like virus outbreak.  However, now that  we\r\n\r\nknow of the existence of the Hendra-like virus in our region, we\r\n\r\nhave  to  take special precautions.  First, Pulau Bulan must  be\r\n\r\nfree  from  the  Hendra-like virus  or  Nipah  virus.   PPD  has\r\n\r\nrecently  inspected Pulau Bulan and did not observe any clinical\r\n\r\nevidence of the disease there.  PPD has also taken blood samples\r\n\r\nof  the pigs and sent them to CDC, Atlanta, USA, for Nipah virus\r\n\r\ntesting.   When we receive the test results to confirm that  the\r\n\r\nfarms  and the island are free from the disease, then we can  be\r\n\r\nsure  that Pulau Bulan is indeed free.  Following that, we  will\r\n\r\ndo  regular blood testing every two weeks to exclude  the  Nipah\r\n\r\nvirus infection.  We will also maintain strict viral security at\r\n\r\nthe  farms, ie, the pigs can only be brought into the farms with\r\n\r\nPPD's  approval.   We will insist on the maintenance  of  strict\r\n\r\nhygiene  and control of vectors such as mosquitoes,  bats  which\r\n\r\nare potential Nipah virus vector and rodents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, PPD will insist that the following measures be\r\n\r\ntaken:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All pigs, from the weaning stage, must wear ear tags that\r\n\r\nare  serially  numbered  and approved  by  PPD  as  a  means  of\r\n\r\nidentification.  Each consignment of pigs must be  isolated  for\r\n\r\ntwo weeks prior to exporting to Singapore.  Every consignment of\r\n\r\npigs  must  be inspected by a PPD veterinary officer  to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  pigs  are properly identified and are healthy  before\r\n\r\nloading   into   barges  for  transport  to  Singapore.    Every\r\n\r\nconsignment  of  pigs  must again be inspected  for  health  and\r\n\r\nidentification on arrival in Singapore.  In the short term,  PPD\r\n\r\nwill  station  its  own veterinary officers full-time  at  Pulau\r\n\r\nBulan  to  check production and health records, closely  monitor\r\n\r\nthe  farms  for any sign of infectious diseases and ensure  that\r\n\r\nall pigs are properly tagged and accounted for.  In this way, we\r\n\r\ncan be confident that any pig imported into Singapore from Pulau\r\n\r\nBulan will be disease-free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Tsao Yuan asked whether the illnesses could have\r\n\r\nbeen avoided.  Let me\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nexplain that our actions taken have been effective\r\n\r\nin preventing the JE outbreak from occurring in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the illnesses affecting the local abattoir workers\r\n\r\nhave  been confirmed to be due to the previously unknown Hendra-like  virus.   Prior to 19th March 1999, there were  no  reports\r\n\r\nfrom  Malaysia that indicated that another virus other  than  JE\r\n\r\nmay be involved in the human cases there.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee also asked about the seriousness of the illnesses.\r\n\r\nEleven abattoir workers were affected by the viral illness.   Of\r\n\r\nthese,  9 had infection of the brain and 2 had infection of  the\r\n\r\nlungs.  One of the patients died and 9 have been discharged from\r\n\r\nhospital  as at 12th April 1999.  The remaining patient  who  is\r\n\r\nstill in hospital has improved and is in stable condition.   The\r\n\r\npatient  is  expected to be discharged from hospital later  this\r\n\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illness caused by the Hendra-like virus is serious and\r\n\r\ncan  be fatal.  Prompt action by the various Government agencies\r\n\r\nhas  limited  the number of infections.  We were unfortunate  to\r\n\r\nhave  one  fatality  but  we are thankful  that  the  rest  have\r\n\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the\r\n\r\nMinister  if we need to diversify our sources of food import  as\r\n\r\nmuch as possible from now on and whether he will promote chilled\r\n\r\nfresh meat as the preferred choice of meat in Singapore, and  if\r\n\r\nanything can be done and has been done to facilitate this?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, the outbreak of the Nipah virus is\r\n\r\nof  serious  consequences to us as far as our  pig  imports  are\r\n\r\nconcerned.   Even with all the precautions that we  have  taken,\r\n\r\nthe   supply  from  Pulau  Bulan  can  only  meet  20%  of   our\r\n\r\nconsumption.   At the same time, we do not see the  supply  from\r\n\r\nJohor or the rest of Malaysia coming in in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nSo  our main sources will have to be from other countries in the\r\n\r\nform   of   chilled  or  frozen  pork.   This  is  the  business\r\n\r\nenvironment\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthat we are communicating to those in the trade.  We\r\n\r\nare having discussions with the pork stallholders association\r\n\r\nand explaining to them that they have to adjust to this new\r\n\r\nenvironment and the Government would help them to adapt to this\r\n\r\nnew condition.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At best, Pulau Bulan can supply us 20%. The supply from\r\n\r\nMalaysia  will not be forthcoming, and even if it is forthcoming\r\n\r\nin  the  following months or years, it will continue to  have  a\r\n\r\nquestion  mark because of the outbreak of the Hendra virus.   We\r\n\r\nwill  always  have  to  look out for  possible  outbreaks.   For\r\n\r\nreasons  of food safety and hygiene and diversification  of  our\r\n\r\nsources, we feel that we have to move to chilled and frozen pork\r\n\r\nfrom  a  wider  variety of sources and we will be  working  with\r\n\r\ntraders  in the trade on how to adjust to providing chilled  and\r\n\r\nfrozen pork to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister has\r\n\r\nsaid  that the PAP Town Councils have given a waiver of  service\r\n\r\nand  conservancy charges to all stalls selling  pork.   I  would\r\n\r\nlike  to report to this House that the Potong Pasir Town Council\r\n\r\nhas done likewise.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask two\r\n\r\nquestions?  The first is:  is pork, which has been infected with\r\n\r\nthe Nipah virus and the Hendra-like virus, safe for eating?  The\r\n\r\nsecond  question is:  how can we ensure that if we eat  pork  we\r\n\r\nwould  not suffer from eating pork precisely since there  was  a\r\n\r\ncase of pigs being smuggled into Singapore recently?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We have said this repeatedly. First of\r\n\r\nall,  pigs  which  are  affected by JE, the  pork  is  safe  for\r\n\r\nconsumption.  JE is not transmitted from human to human  and  it\r\n\r\nis  not transmitted from eating pork.  The evidence so far shows\r\n\r\nthat  this  is the same for the Hendra-like virus or  the  Nipah\r\n\r\nvirus, ie, you will not contract the virus from a human being or\r\n\r\nfrom eating pork.  The evidence so far shows that those who were\r\n\r\ndown  with  the disease were in direct contact with  a  diseased\r\n\r\npig.  That is the main source of infection.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I\r\n\r\nask the Minister, given that there is a Hendra-like virus\r\n\r\ninvolved, race-horses which have visited Malaysia in the last\r\n\r\nsix months may be susceptible to this.  What measures is the\r\n\r\nMinistry taking to make sure that these horses are not infected?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, since 19th March 1999, we have\r\n\r\nbanned   the  movement  of  race-horses  between  Malaysia   and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  These horses are kept in quarantine.  They have been\r\n\r\ntested  for infection of the virus.  The Turf  Club in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas  also  systematically set out to  test  all  the  horses  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  as  a  precautionary  measure.   Only  when  we   are\r\n\r\nconfident  that  the horses are free from the  disease  will  we\r\n\r\nadmit the horses into Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Will the Government assist existing\r\n\r\nfresh pork sellers to transfer to the sale of chilled and frozen\r\n\r\npork?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We are in discussion with the\r\n\r\nassociation  and  stallholders.  We think it  is  necessary  and\r\n\r\nimportant for the stallholders to switch to facilities that  can\r\n\r\nallow  them  to  sell frozen or chilled pork.   I  think  Lianhe\r\n\r\nZaobao  has reported that a stallholder in Marine Parade  market\r\n\r\nhas  renovated his stall to sell chilled pork.  It shows a  very\r\n\r\ninnovative  and entrepreneurial approach to the situation.   The\r\n\r\nchiller  facilities  cost  less than  $6,000.   The  Government,\r\n\r\nthrough  HDB  and ENV, will facilitate all this conversion.   We\r\n\r\nwill  provide the necessary power supply.  We will  upgrade  all\r\n\r\nour  wet  markets  so  that  all the  stalls  can  be  similarly\r\n\r\nupgraded.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, can I ask the Minister about the wild\r\n\r\nboars in Pulau Ubin which have been ordered to be killed?

Many of them are not even in Singapore.\r\n\r\nOf  those  in Singapore, only a few of them, about 14,  actually\r\n\r\nlive in the former Istana Kampong Glam.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position of the Sultan Hussain Ordinance has been\r\n\r\nclarified by Government in the past.  In particular, the  former\r\n\r\nMinister for National Development, Mr S Dhanabalan, set out  the\r\n\r\nposition clearly in this House on 12th March 1991, and  I  quote\r\n\r\nan extract:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In 1896, towards the end of the last century, there was a\r\n\r\ndispute  among the family of Sultan Hussain as to  who  was  the\r\n\r\nsuccessor  to the Sultanate and to the estate, ie,  the  Kampong\r\n\r\nGlam  Estate.   This matter went to court and in December  1897,\r\n\r\nthe  Court of Appeal ruled that there was no one who could claim\r\n\r\nto  be  the  successor.  The estate, therefore reverted  to  the\r\n\r\nCrown.  It became State land and it was no longer subject to the\r\n\r\ntreaties which previously affected it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the Kampong Glam Estate including the former\r\n\r\nIstana has been State Land since 1897.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British Government then enacted the Sultan Hussain\r\n\r\nOrdinance in 1904.  The intention of the Ordinance was  to  take\r\n\r\ncare  of the financial needs of the family at that time  of  the\r\n\r\nlate  Sultan  Hussain  who were described by  the  then  British\r\n\r\nGovernor  as \"very improvident people\".  The Ordinance  provided\r\n\r\nfor  annual  payment of monies to the family of the late  Sultan\r\n\r\nHussain  pegged  to  the income derived from  the  Kampong  Glam\r\n\r\nEstate.   These  payments were not intended to be in  perpetuity\r\n\r\nbut  were  intended to be made only to \"the family of  the  late\r\n\r\nSultan   Hussain\"  at  the  time  the  Ordinance  was   enacted.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  for  historical  reasons,  annual  payments  were\r\n\r\ncontinued to be made by subsequent Governments all these 100-odd\r\n\r\nyears.   This  has  led  to  a  very  unsatisfactory  situation.\r\n\r\nFirstly,   while  the  number  of  beneficiaries  has   steadily\r\n\r\nincreased, the payments are getting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsmaller as the income from which the payments are\r\n\r\nmade has diminished.  Secondly, in future the payments would\r\n\r\nbecome even smaller over time as the number of beneficiaries\r\n\r\nincreases.  In view of these factors and with the recently\r\n\r\nannounced new conservation projects for Istana Kampong Glam and\r\n\r\nthe adjacent building as a Malay Heritage Centre, Government has\r\n\r\ndecided that it is timely to review the scheme of payments under\r\n\r\nthe Ordinance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided on a new scheme of\r\n\r\npayments.   Firstly,  we will increase the  actual  payments  to\r\n\r\n$350,000  per  annum.  Secondly, this new sum  of  $350,000  per\r\n\r\nannum will be maintained for a fixed period of 30 years starting\r\n\r\nfrom  this  year to be distributed among the existing number  of\r\n\r\nbeneficiaries in the same proportion to the total annual payment\r\n\r\nthat  they are receiving at present.  This revised fixed  income\r\n\r\nwill  be a substantial increase of more than 10 times the actual\r\n\r\nannual payment to the beneficiaries at present which amounts  to\r\n\r\nabout  $29,231.   In  addition, if any beneficiary  wishes,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will allow him the option of receiving  a  lump  sum\r\n\r\npayment up-front which would be equivalent to the present  value\r\n\r\nof the future stream of payments under the new scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme will apply to all existing beneficiaries\r\n\r\nregardless  of  where they presently live.  Those  beneficiaries\r\n\r\nwho  are  now occupants at the former Istana Kampong  Glam  will\r\n\r\nbenefit from this new scheme of payments in addition to whatever\r\n\r\nresettlement benefits they may get as described earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new scheme is an equitable way of meeting the\r\n\r\ninterests  of  the existing beneficiaries.  The  alternative  of\r\n\r\nmaintaining  the status quo will mean progressively  diminishing\r\n\r\namounts of payments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Office will contact the beneficiaries individually\r\n\r\nto explain the new scheme to them.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> I would like to thank the\r\n\r\nMinister for the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nvery comprehensive answer.

The average two-month default\r\n\r\nrate (ie, the percentage of employers who have not paid CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions for their employees for 2 months) was 1.47% for\r\n\r\n1998, as compared with 1.39% for 1997.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member that CPF contributions form an\r\n\r\nintegral  part of employees' wages and workers depend  on  these\r\n\r\nsavings  to service their housing loans and to meet medical  and\r\n\r\nretirement  needs.  The CPF Board, as trustee  of  CPF  members'\r\n\r\nsavings, takes a serious view of such default cases.  It was for\r\n\r\nthis  reason  that  the Board amended the CPF  Act  in  1998  to\r\n\r\nexpedite the recovery of CPF arrears and to ensure that the  CPF\r\n\r\nBoard  could  deal effectively and promptly with  employers  who\r\n\r\nfailed  to pay CPF contributions for their employees within  the\r\n\r\nprescribed  periods,  and to recover these  contributions  which\r\n\r\nwere due.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, however, my Ministry is aware that many\r\n\r\nemployers  are  facing  financial difficulty  in  this  economic\r\n\r\ndownturn  and the CPF Board will assist them wherever  possible.\r\n\r\nIn  enforcing  CPF payments from employers, the CPF  Board  will\r\n\r\nbalance  the  need  for quick action to recover  employees'  CPF\r\n\r\ncontribution with the flexibility to allow employers to overcome\r\n\r\ntheir  temporary cash flow difficulties to survive this downturn\r\n\r\nand  to  save  jobs.   For example, the  CPF  Board  will  allow\r\n\r\nemployers   who   are   taken  to  court  for   defaulting   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions  to  pay their arrears by monthly  instalments  if\r\n\r\ntheir  current contributions are paid on time, on the  condition\r\n\r\nthat  they  must produce evidence of their ability  to  pay  the\r\n\r\narrears.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF Board also compounds the offences of employers who\r\n\r\nare able to settle their CPF arrears before the court hearing so\r\n\r\nthat they do not have to appear in court and pay heavier fines.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to assure the Member that the CPF Board\r\n\r\nwill continue to monitor default cases closely, exercise\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nflexibility where arrears could be paid by monthly\r\n\r\ninstalments and take quick action to recover the arrears through\r\n\r\nCourt action if the need arises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>TOLL CHARGES AT WOODLANDS CAUSEWAY AND SECOND LINK</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Payment by cash cards)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr R.

On  a  typical\r\n\r\nweekday, about 44,000 vehicles pass through the Checkpoint, half\r\n\r\nof  which  pass through between 5 pm and 10 pm.

As the redevelopment of such sites would benefit\r\n\r\nthe  country as a whole, HDB flats affected by SERS are acquired\r\n\r\nunder  the Land Acquisition Act.   Voting is not used to  decide\r\n\r\nwhether a site will undergo SERS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affected flat lessees are compensated for their existing\r\n\r\nflats  at  the prevailing market values as at the  date  of  the\r\n\r\nannouncement of SERS.  In addition, they are assured  allocation\r\n\r\nof  new replacement flats at subsidised prices, frozen as at the\r\n\r\ndate  of the announcement of the SERS, plus a 20% price discount\r\n\r\nup  to a maximum of $30,000, if they are eligible to buy a  flat\r\n\r\ndirectly from the HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blocks 1 to 8, 10 and 12 to 14 of Hillview Avenue were\r\n\r\nannounced for redevelopment under SERS on 21st March 1999.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB conducts a survey among the affected lessees\r\n\r\nimmediately after the announcement of each SERS site  to  obtain\r\n\r\ntheir  feedback.   The  survey  also  serves  to  ascertain  the\r\n\r\nlessees'  preferred rehousing options so that the HDB  can  plan\r\n\r\nand  build  the  new flats at the replacement site  taking  into\r\n\r\naccount their preferences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SERS has been well received by the affected lessees in\r\n\r\nthose precincts that have been announced for redevelopment under\r\n\r\nthe Scheme.  For the 29 SERS sites announced from August 1995 to\r\n\r\nend  1998,  the average support level from affected  lessees  is\r\n\r\nabout  94%.   Even  for the Hillview Avenue  site,  84%  of  the\r\n\r\nresidents  who have returned their survey forms so far supported\r\n\r\nthe scheme.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MP for Bukit Gombak has requested for a higher mortgage\r\n\r\nloan  to be granted for SERS lessees in Hillview Estate who have\r\n\r\nbought their existing flats from the open market at a high price\r\n\r\nand  who still have substantial outstanding mortgage loans.   As\r\n\r\nit  is, HDB already grants mortgager loans of up to 90% to those\r\n\r\nlessees  who  have  opted for 4-room new replacement  flats  and\r\n\r\nwhose  available CPF monies in the ordinary account and  balance\r\n\r\ncompensation  are insufficient to meet the downpayment  and  the\r\n\r\nstamp\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nand conveyancing fees for the new flats.  This will\r\n\r\ninclude cases where the compensation is not sufficient to pay\r\n\r\nfor the outstanding mortgage loans of the affected SERS flats.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are specific cases of existing 5-roomers having\r\n\r\nproblems purchasing 5-room replacement flats, HDB is prepared to\r\n\r\ntake a look at how to help them on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessees under SERS are also exempted from the payment of\r\n\r\nresale  levy,  unless  they  have previously  sold  their  first\r\n\r\nsubsidised  HDB  flats elsewhere and have opted  to  pay  resale\r\n\r\npremium or levy on the next direct purchase flat from HDB.   The\r\n\r\namount of resale premium or levy to be paid will depend on  when\r\n\r\ntheir  first  subsidised flats were sold.   According  to  HDB's\r\n\r\nrecord,  87%  of  the  lessees at Hillview Estate  will  not  be\r\n\r\nrequired to pay any resale premium or levy.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the small group of lessees who need to pay resale\r\n\r\npremium  or  levy, they have currently a few options  to  choose\r\n\r\nfrom:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) They can pay the resale premium together with the\r\n\r\nselling  price of the replacement flat.  This can then  be  paid\r\n\r\nusing CPF or through the mortgage loan taken from HDB.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) They can re-opt to pay the graded resale levy based on\r\n\r\nthe lower percentages prevailing at the time of resale (plus the\r\n\r\n5%   interest  since  then),  instead  of  the  current   higher\r\n\r\npercentages of resale.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) They can sell the existing flat together with the\r\n\r\nrehousing  benefits  in  the  open market  to  eligible  buyers,\r\n\r\ninstead  of  taking up a replacement flat themselves.   In  this\r\n\r\nway,  they  will  not be required to pay the resale  premium  or\r\n\r\nlevy.   With  the  sale proceeds that would  include  a  premium\r\n\r\nfetched  for the rehousing benefits, they can buy an  equivalent\r\n\r\nresale flat from the open market with some cash balance.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) They can transfer the existing flat to eligible\r\n\r\npersons,  eg, family members.

We  announced this on 21st March 1999.  On  his  fourth\r\n\r\nquestion  of  whether  we  would grant a  waiver  to  third-time\r\n\r\nbuyers, our policy so far is that every Singaporean family  will\r\n\r\nenjoy  two  concessionary mortgage loans.  The third  loan  will\r\n\r\nhave to be at market interest rate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, does intensive development mean\r\n\r\nbuilding condominiums there?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Intensive development would cover both\r\n\r\nmore  intensive public housing as well as higher  value  private\r\n\r\nhousing.  This means that the site reflects higher potential for\r\n\r\nredevelopment,  and we acquire these sites.  We  redevelop  them\r\n\r\nfor  the interest of the country and we share the benefits  with\r\n\r\nthe lessees.  We pay the lessees market price for their existing\r\n\r\nflats.   We  assure them a new flat in the vicinity at  a  price\r\n\r\nwhich is subsidised, and we give them an extra 20% discount.  So\r\n\r\nthe benefits of the redevelopment are shared between the lessees\r\n\r\nand the country.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the Minister for his answer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the resale premium, I would like to inform the Minister\r\n\r\nthat  about  15% of the residents will have to pay the  premium,\r\n\r\nand  they have sold their flats five or 10 years ago.   If  they\r\n\r\nhave not been affected by the SERS scheme, they may not have  to\r\n\r\npay  the  resale  levy  or premium.  I would  ask  the  Minister\r\n\r\nwhether he would consider waiving the levy payment.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Sir, let me explain the situation of\r\n\r\nthese  cases  who  are required to pay resale premium  or  levy.\r\n\r\nBasically, they have already enjoyed a subsidised flat from  the\r\n\r\nGovernment.   They bought a subsidised flat from the  Government\r\n\r\nmany  years  ago.  They sold away this flat.  At  the  point  of\r\n\r\nselling  the flat, you have to decide whether to pay a  levy  on\r\n\r\nthe  flat  that you sell or that you pay a premium on  the  next\r\n\r\nflat  that  you buy from the Government.  So when  these  people\r\n\r\nsold  their flats, they had to opt.  Either they decide  to  pay\r\n\r\nthe levy or they decide to pay the premium.  Many of them decide\r\n\r\nto  pay the premium.  When they sold their first flat, they have\r\n\r\nalready  made  an undertaking that when they buy the  next  flat\r\n\r\nfrom  the Government, they will pay a 10% or 20% premium.   Now,\r\n\r\nwhen  they  are  buying this flat from the  Government,  we  are\r\n\r\nasking  them to pay the premium.  So this is part of  what  they\r\n\r\nhave decided, because if they have paid the levy, now they would\r\n\r\nnot  have  to  pay  the premium.  So you cannot  say  that  just\r\n\r\nbecause  they have opted to pay the premium, now they should  be\r\n\r\nexcused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what happens to all those people who have paid the\r\n\r\nlevy  when they sold off their first flats?  It is not  fair  to\r\n\r\nthe  other  group.   So  we say that for these  people  who  are\r\n\r\naffected by the premium that they have paid, we are prepared  to\r\n\r\nback-track the decision, go back to the original date when  they\r\n\r\nsell  their flat, pay the premium as what the others have  done,\r\n\r\nplus  the  5%  interest since then, which is very  fair.   If  a\r\n\r\nlessee cannot pay, he can sell his flat to somebody and he  does\r\n\r\nnot have to pay the premium.  The flat that he sells today\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nin Hillview Estate to another person in the open\r\n\r\nmarket attracts a higher price because it comes with the option\r\n\r\nto buy another brand new flat in the Bukit Gombak area with a\r\n\r\ndiscount and all the benefits associated with SERS.  So if he is\r\n\r\nnot happy with buying a new flat from the HDB, he can sell his\r\n\r\nexisting flat which will fetch a higher price than the current\r\n\r\nmarket value.  Why?  This is because it comes with a rehousing\r\n\r\noption.  With the price that he gets from his present flat, he\r\n\r\ncan buy back the same type of flat, the same remaining lease and\r\n\r\nstill have some cash balance in his pocket.  So it is eminently\r\n\r\nfair.  They have so many options that they can choose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>POLITICAL ORGANISATIONS IN NATIONAL</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Release of statements on issues of public interest)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Education\r\n\r\nwhether  the  statements  of  political  organisations  in   the\r\n\r\nNational  University  of  Singapore to express  their  views  on\r\n\r\nissues  of  public interest, have first to be  approved  by  the\r\n\r\nUniversity  administration before they can be  released  to  the\r\n\r\npress and the public.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  our universities do not prohibit  students  from\r\n\r\nexpressing  their  views on various issues, including  those  of\r\n\r\npublic interest.

LTA, however,\r\n\r\nwill  continue to monitor the effectiveness of Buscam  with  the\r\n\r\nbus  operators and extend the system to more bus services as and\r\n\r\nwhen necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmammograms)\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SCREENING FOR BREAST CANCER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Use of Medisave to pay for mammograms)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Health what\r\n\r\nmeasures  are being taken to educate women on the importance  of\r\n\r\nregular  screening  for  breast  cancer;  and  whether  he  will\r\n\r\nconsider  allowing  women  to use  their  Medisave  to  pay  for\r\n\r\nmammograms.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K.

On Polling Day, a voter is  given\r\n\r\na ballot paper by the Presiding Officer to mark a candidate or a\r\n\r\ngroup  of  candidates  of  his  choice.   The  ballot  paper  is\r\n\r\nperforated with the official mark made by a perforator as  proof\r\n\r\nthat the ballot paper is an authorised one.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The perforator is a precision instrument which is delicate\r\n\r\nto  handle.  Those unfamiliar with its usage tend to jam it when\r\n\r\nattempting  to  perforate the ballot  paper.   This  causes  the\r\n\r\nballot paper to be stuck to the perforator.  In trying to remove\r\n\r\nthe paper, it often ends up torn.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These perforators, belonging to the Elections Department,\r\n\r\nwere purchased in the 1950s and are relics.  With the passage of\r\n\r\ntime,  they  are prone to breakdowns despite regular  servicing.\r\n\r\nThe  Elections  Department has therefore been  looking  at  more\r\n\r\nefficient means to authenticate ballot papers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Elections Department is proposing that ballot papers be\r\n\r\nhenceforth  authenticated in the form of a pre-printed  security\r\n\r\npattern,  rubber-stamping or other markings.  Clause  4  of  the\r\n\r\nBill  amends  section 40 of the Parliamentary Elections  Act  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  the authentication of ballot papers by  these  new\r\n\r\nmethods.   Clause 9(2) amends the corresponding section  of  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends section 42(2) of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  Act  to  provide for an election official  to  either\r\n\r\naffix  or  stamp or mark the ballot paper to officially complete\r\n\r\nthe  authentication,  if  a  ballot paper  has  not  been  fully\r\n\r\nauthenticated.  Clause 9(3) amends the corresponding\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsection of the Presidential Elections Act for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with the change in the method of authentication, a\r\n\r\nballot  paper shall be rejected if it is not fully and  properly\r\n\r\nauthenticated  by  a  pre-printed  design,  stamped,  marked  or\r\n\r\ninitialled  by  the Presiding Officer.  Clause 7 amends  section\r\n\r\n50(1)  of the Parliamentary Elections Act and clause 9(6) amends\r\n\r\nthe  corresponding section of the Presidential Elections Act for\r\n\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(B)  Common cut-off date to determine voter eligibility/address</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me explain the rationale for aligning the cut-off\r\n\r\ndate  for  changes of addresses with the cut-off date for  voter\r\n\r\neligibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the cut-off date for voter eligibility is 1st\r\n\r\nJuly  or  such other cut-off date as specified by the  Minister.\r\n\r\nFollowing  the cut-off date for voter eligibility, the Registers\r\n\r\nof  Electors are printed and exhibited for public inspection for\r\n\r\n14  days.   However,  the present cut-off date  for  changes  of\r\n\r\naddresses is the last day for public inspection of the Registers\r\n\r\nof  Electors.   With two different cut-off dates, the  Registers\r\n\r\nare therefore produced twice.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give this as an example. In the 1996 Registers of\r\n\r\nElectors, there were two cut-off dates, ie, 15th April for voter\r\n\r\neligibility, and 23rd May 1996 for the changes of addresses.  In\r\n\r\nthis instance, the Registers had to be produced twice.  One  set\r\n\r\nof  Registers was produced on 9th May 1996 for public inspection\r\n\r\non  voter  eligibility, and the subsequent set was  produced  on\r\n\r\n27th  June 1996 after the public inspection to incorporate fresh\r\n\r\nchanges  of addresses up to 23rd May 1996.  This is unproductive\r\n\r\nand a waste of resources.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed amendment for a common cut-off date for\r\n\r\nboth  voter  eligibility  and changes  of  addresses,  the  same\r\n\r\nRegisters  of  Electors will be printed,  exhibited  for  public\r\n\r\ninspection,  and subsequently certified for use.  No  reprinting\r\n\r\nwill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbe  done.   Should there be any amendments as a  result  of  the\r\n\r\npublic  inspection,  they  can  be  produced  as  additions   or\r\n\r\ndeletions  to the same Registers of Electors.  With  one  common\r\n\r\ncut-off  date, the period between the production and  exhibition\r\n\r\nof Registers for public inspection and certification is reduced,\r\n\r\nas there is no processing of address changes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 13(4) of the Parliamentary\r\n\r\nElections  Act  to  exclude  alterations  to  the  Registers  of\r\n\r\nElectors  on  account  of changes of addresses  notified  on  or\r\n\r\nbefore  the last day of inspection of the register prior to  the\r\n\r\ncertification.   With  this amendment, the Registration  Officer\r\n\r\nwill prepare the Registers of Electors based on the addresses of\r\n\r\nelectors   as   recorded   by  the  Commissioner   of   National\r\n\r\nRegistration as of 1st July or the common cut-off date specified\r\n\r\nby the Minister.  He will not be allowed to accept any change of\r\n\r\naddress  made  after 1st July or the prescribed  common  cut-off\r\n\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(C)   Empowering Election Agents to appoint Polling and Counting Agents</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now explain why there is a need to\r\n\r\namend the Parliamentary Elections Act to empower election agents\r\n\r\nto appoint counting and polling agents.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, in a Group Representation Constituency (GRC),\r\n\r\nthere  is  a  Principal Election Agent and a number of  Election\r\n\r\nAgents.   Only the Principal Election Agent can appoint  polling\r\n\r\nand  counting  agents.  This involves much administrative  work,\r\n\r\nwhich  could be done by other Election Agents.  Clause 6  amends\r\n\r\nsection  49  of  the Parliamentary Elections Act  to  allow  the\r\n\r\nElection Agent of any candidate in a group, in addition  to  the\r\n\r\nPrincipal  Election  Agent for that group, to  appoint  counting\r\n\r\nagents.   Clause  9(5) amends the corresponding section  of  the\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the election agents of candidates in a group\r\n\r\nwill  be  allowed to appoint polling agents.  This will  relieve\r\n\r\nthe  workload of the Principal Election Agent, who is  currently\r\n\r\nthe only one allowed to\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nappoint polling agents.  Clause 8 amends section 64(1A)  of  the\r\n\r\nParliamentary   Elections  Act  and  clause  9(8)   amends   the\r\n\r\ncorresponding section of the Presidential Elections Act for this\r\n\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nPresidential Elections Act (Cap 218)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the Presidential Elections Act\r\n\r\namendment.   The  counting  of ballot papers  is  undertaken  in\r\n\r\ncounting  places,  which  are usually  located  in  schools  and\r\n\r\ncommunity  centres.  The results of the count at  each  counting\r\n\r\nplace are tallied at constituency level by a number of Assistant\r\n\r\nReturning  Officers.  Once these results are tallied,  they  are\r\n\r\ntransmitted to the Returning Officer who will then  add  up  the\r\n\r\nresults of all the constituencies.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first Presidential Elections held on 28th August\r\n\r\n1993,  only  one  election agent could  be  appointed  for  each\r\n\r\ncandidate.  This was found to be inadequate, as there  was  much\r\n\r\nadministrative  work to be done.  Clause 9(7)  therefore  amends\r\n\r\nsection 43 of the Presidential Elections Act to provide for  the\r\n\r\nappointment  of  up to 20 persons as Election  Agents  for  each\r\n\r\nPresidential  candidate,  of whom one  shall  be  appointed  the\r\n\r\nPrincipal Election Agent.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As there would be up to 20 Election Agents, one of whom is\r\r\n\r\nthe  Principal  Election Agent, there is a need to differentiate\r\n\r\nor  identify  the  main roles of the Principal  Election  Agent.\r\n\r\nThese  roles are spelt out in the relevant clauses in the  Bill.\r\n\r\nClause  9(4) amends section 31A(2) of the Presidential Elections\r\n\r\nAct to make it mandatory for the Returning Officer to inform the\r\n\r\nPrincipal  Election  Agent of a presidential  candidate  of  the\r\n\r\ncounting places.  Clause 9(5) amends section 32 of the same  Act\r\n\r\nto   provide  that  only  the  Principal  Election   Agents   or\r\n\r\npresidential candidates may be present at any principal counting\r\n\r\nplace where the votes are eventually added.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9(14) amends section 49 to require personal expenses\r\n\r\nof the candidate exceeding $1,000 to be paid by his\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nPrincipal  Election Agent.  This is a change  from  the  current\r\n\r\nposition where the sole Election Agent is responsible for paying\r\n\r\nsuch  expenses.  The same clause also amends section 56  of  the\r\n\r\nPresidential  Elections Act to impose on the Principal  Election\r\n\r\nAgent  the  sole  obligation to file  the  returns  on  election\r\n\r\nexpenses.   Section 64(2) of the Act is also amended to  require\r\n\r\nthe Principal Election Agent to inform the Returning Officer  of\r\n\r\nthe candidate's campaign offices in each polling district.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these amendments are necessary to further\r\n\r\nimprove our election processes without compromising the security\r\n\r\nof  the  process.   The amendments in this  Bill  are  practical\r\n\r\nchanges   to   enhance  and  fine-tune  the  current   electoral\r\n\r\nprocesses,  and hence make our elections, be it the Presidential\r\n\r\nElection  or  the  Parliamentary Election, more streamlined  and\r\n\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, for giving me\r\n\r\nthis opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has comprehensively dealt\r\n\r\nwith  the proposed amendment to the Bill.  I would like to share\r\n\r\nsome  of  the concerns which I have.  First of all, we have  had\r\n\r\nvery fair elections from 1959 to now.  There is no question ever\r\n\r\nraised  as to the secrecy of the vote.  The secrecy of the  vote\r\n\r\nis  protected  and  I  hope  the Minister  will  reiterate  this\r\n\r\nposition  again today, that the changes will not affect  in  any\r\n\r\nway but will in fact improve the system.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another suggestion which I have is this. Although we\r\n\r\nhave  had  fairly fair elections, in other countries (in  Africa\r\n\r\nand  Asia), the United Nations (UN) has to observe the electoral\r\n\r\nprocess.   Here,  we  have  been  fortunate.   May  I  ask   the\r\n\r\nGovernment  to  consider whether it will be  in  the  long  term\r\n\r\ninterest   of   Singapore  to  have  an   independent   election\r\n\r\ncommission, which is a practice in many other countries?\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Presidential Election is likely to take place this\r\n\r\nyear.   I am glad that the amendment is being made.  And  may  I\r\n\r\nagain  urge political parties not to take part in the  elections\r\n\r\nand  leave the electoral process as non-partisan, which had been\r\n\r\ndone in the last election.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I end my speech, may I say that the reason why\r\n\r\nwe  have had very clean and fair elections since 1959 is because\r\n\r\nof  what  the  political parties themselves have  done  and  the\r\n\r\npeople  have  taken the trouble to vote in fair and  independent\r\n\r\nelections.  Democracy is still young in Singapore.  It  is  very\r\n\r\nimportant for us to have a system whereby the public is  assured\r\n\r\nthat the electoral process would always be protected.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to focus\r\n\r\non the amendment which provides for the authentication of ballot\r\n\r\npapers  by new means, instead of by perforators.  There are  two\r\n\r\nlarger  issues or principles involved here.  The first principle\r\n\r\nis  that  every  vote should be genuine.  In other  words,  that\r\n\r\nthere should be no false votes by fictitious persons or votes by\r\n\r\npersons masquerading as other persons.  The second principle  is\r\n\r\nthat every vote should be secret.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Amendment Bill seeks to update techniques for providing\r\n\r\nfor  an  official  mark on the ballot papers for authentication.\r\n\r\nSince the authentication of ballot papers is precisely to ensure\r\n\r\nthat the first principle of genuineness of the vote is upheld, I\r\n\r\ntherefore  do not see any problems on this score.  The question,\r\n\r\nhowever,  that  I  have  is: do the new  authentication  methods\r\n\r\nuphold  the  second principle, that of secrecy of the  vote?   I\r\n\r\nnote  that  section  40(3) of the Parliamentary  Elections  Act,\r\n\r\nwhich  is  just  before  the  proposed  insertion  of  the   new\r\n\r\nauthentication  clause, states that, \"Each  ballot  paper  shall\r\n\r\nhave  a  number  printed on the back and shall have  attached  a\r\n\r\ncounterfoil with the same number printed on the face.\"  If  this\r\n\r\nis  the  case, then it is technically possible to trace  how  an\r\n\r\nindividual  voted  by matching his name and  IC  number  on  the\r\n\r\ncounterfoil against the serial number on the ballot paper.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCould  the  Minister please clarify whether this is  indeed  the\r\n\r\ncase, and whether the vote is indeed secret?  In addition, could\r\n\r\nthe Minister please clarify the purpose of these serial numbers?\r\n\r\nThis  is  in  order to allay fears that those who vote  for  the\r\n\r\nOpposition could be identified and, therefore, possibly included\r\n\r\nin  the  black book of the Government which would be counter  to\r\n\r\nthe  daily cherished democratic principle that elections  should\r\n\r\nbe free and fair.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, to the extent that the Bill before the House\r\n\r\ndoes  not  in any way impinge upon the two principles: (1)  that\r\n\r\nthe  vote  should be genuine; and (2) that every vote should  be\r\n\r\nsecret, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I only have three\r\n\r\npoints  to  raise.   Firstly, how does the Elections  Department\r\n\r\nensure  that every ballot paper is fully authenticated and  does\r\n\r\nnot  end  up  being  void by default?  Secondly,  is  there  any\r\n\r\nprocedure where it would ensure proper authentication  of  every\r\n\r\nballot  paper  that is being issued?  Thirdly, the  question  of\r\n\r\nserial numbers printed on the ballot papers, which was raised by\r\n\r\nDr  Lee.   I would like to know whether it is necessary to  have\r\n\r\nthe  serial  number  in  view of the new authentication  method.\r\n\r\nWould  the  Minister clarify why is there a need for the  serial\r\n\r\nnumber to be printed on the ballot paper and what is the purpose\r\n\r\nof the serial number?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for their\r\n\r\ncomments  and  questions.  First, on Mr  Rai's  question  on  an\r\n\r\nelection commission.  I do not think there is any doubt that our\r\n\r\nElections  Department  has carried out  its  duties  faithfully,\r\n\r\ndutifully,  and without any fear and favour.  As he himself  has\r\n\r\nsaid,  our  elections since 1959 have been clean and  fair.   So\r\n\r\nfar,  there has been no allegation that the Department has  been\r\n\r\nunfair.   At  every election, a Returning Officer  is  appointed\r\n\r\nfrom  among the senior civil servants who would ensure that  the\r\n\r\nwhole process is carried out smoothly.  And there is no question\r\n\r\nthat  the whole process has been done properly.  There had  been\r\n\r\nvery\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfew  election  petitions to the courts to open up the  vault  to\r\n\r\ncheck  the  ballot  papers  or to question  the  whole  election\r\n\r\nprocess.   The results speak for themselves.  Since  the  system\r\n\r\nworks  well and the Elections Department is doing a good job,  I\r\n\r\ndo not see any need for an election commission.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next question which all our three colleagues\r\n\r\nmentioned  here  is the secrecy of the vote.   This  subject  of\r\n\r\nsecrecy  of the vote is, I suppose, as long as we have elections\r\n\r\nin  Singapore.  Members may not know that this subject has  been\r\n\r\nraised  periodically and, every time, when it is raised  answers\r\n\r\nare  given.   Sometimes, we forget the answers and sometimes  we\r\n\r\nare  still  wondering whether the answers are indeed  what  they\r\n\r\nare.  We want the people's fears to be allayed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has stated very clearly why we need to\r\n\r\nhave the serial number on the ballot paper as well as to have  a\r\n\r\ncounterfoil.  The counterfoil is to establish that indeed such a\r\n\r\nballot  paper has been issued.  On the ballot paper itself,  the\r\n\r\nnumber  is  to  establish clearly that there is  indeed  such  a\r\n\r\nballot  paper and there is a corresponding counterfoil  to  show\r\n\r\nthat there is such a ballot paper.  It shows the genuineness  of\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  paper.  The writing of the person's number  on  the\r\n\r\ncounterfoil  is  to show that that particular  ballot  paper  is\r\n\r\ngiven  to that particular voter so that in the event that  there\r\n\r\nis  a dispute, such a vote can actually be traced and that it is\r\n\r\na genuine vote and not a forgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This numbering of ballot papers is not an invention of the\r\n\r\nPAP  Government.   I  think people tend  to  forget  that.   The\r\n\r\nBritish  introduced this in the late 40s.  I  am  told  that  in\r\n\r\nBritain, New Zealand and Canada, they have similar provisions in\r\n\r\nthe  law for the numbering of ballot papers.  One of the reasons\r\n\r\nfor  numbered  ballot  papers  is to  prevent  crooked  election\r\n\r\npractices, such as the stuffing of election ballot boxes.   More\r\n\r\nimportantly,  after the election, all the unused ballot  papers,\r\n\r\nas well as the counterfoils, are put\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ninto the boxes and sealed and they are then kept in the vault of\r\n\r\nthe  High Court.  The boxes cannot be opened without an election\r\n\r\npetition and without the permission of the court, and permission\r\n\r\nwill  only be granted if there is a petition to show why such  a\r\n\r\nprocess needs to be taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months after the polling day, these boxes are then\r\n\r\ntaken  out  of  the  vault  of the  court  and  brought  to  the\r\n\r\nincinerator for burning.  When they are taken out, anybody could\r\n\r\ngo  and take a look at them and see whether indeed the seals  of\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  boxes were broken, and anyone had seen  the  ballot\r\n\r\npapers  to  find  out  who  voted for  whom.   That  process  is\r\n\r\ntransparent and I am sure Mr Low Thia Khiang and Mr Chiam  -   I\r\n\r\ndo  not  know  about  my  other  colleagues   -   have  actually\r\n\r\nwitnessed this process.  The members of the press are very  keen\r\n\r\nto  see  this.   Every time, the Elections Department  announces\r\n\r\nthat  the  ballot  papers would be taken out for  burning,  they\r\n\r\nwould go to the High Court and look at the boxes to ensure  that\r\n\r\nthe boxes' seals had not been broken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This controversy came out again in the 1976 general\r\n\r\nelection  and Dr Lee Siew-Choh, the Opposition leader then,  had\r\n\r\nsaid  that nobody, not even the Government, would know who voted\r\n\r\nfor  whom.  He was trying to assure the voters not to worry  and\r\n\r\nthat  their  vote was secret.  So if Dr Lee Siew-Choh  has  also\r\n\r\nsaid  that the vote is secret, and we have been saying that  the\r\n\r\nvote  is  secret, I think the people should not doubt  that  the\r\n\r\nvote  is indeed secret.  In the rally speech in Queen Street  in\r\n\r\nDecember  1976,  Dr Lee Siew-Choh told his audience  not  to  be\r\n\r\nafraid  to  vote,  I suppose not to be afraid to  vote  for  the\r\n\r\nBarisan  Sosialis, as the vote is secret and he  also  explained\r\n\r\nthe  elaborate process that had to be followed before the ballot\r\n\r\npapers could be taken out to be examined.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1991, my colleague, Prof. Jayakumar, also explained that\r\n\r\nthe   numbered  ballot  papers  provided  the  means  to  settle\r\n\r\nallegations  of  election  fraud.  If voters  alleged  that  the\r\n\r\nballots  had been switched with forgeries, the numbered  ballots\r\n\r\nwould  then  allow the charge to be settled conclusively.   With\r\n\r\nthe numbered ballot papers,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nno one can accuse the Government of rigging an\r\n\r\nelection.  If we do away with the numbering of ballot papers, as\r\n\r\nMr Low's last point seems to suggest, I think we will also face\r\n\r\na new problem.  The new problem would be: how do we know that\r\n\r\nsome of these ballot papers are genuine?  How do you trace that\r\n\r\nthey are genuine?  Even with the mark, stamp or signature, it\r\n\r\nwill not be easy to tell.  But with the number in the\r\n\r\ncounterfoil and the number at the back of the ballot paper, we\r\n\r\ncan then compare the two and say, \"Yes, indeed, such a paper was\r\n\r\nissued and the counterfoil is here, apart from the stamping, the\r\n\r\nmarking and the perforation.\".\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister has not answered my\r\n\r\nquery  about the authentication procedures.  How do  you  ensure\r\n\r\nthat every ballot paper is indeed properly authenticated and not\r\n\r\nvoid?\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I think Mr Low knows the process quite\r\n\r\nwell.   Just briefly, it is something like this.  When the voter\r\n\r\ngoes to the polling station, he presents his IC and his name  is\r\n\r\ncalled.  The Presiding Officer or his assistant will then  check\r\n\r\nto  make sure that he is indeed a registered voter.  Once it  is\r\n\r\nconfirmed that he is, the Presiding Officer will then record  on\r\n\r\nthe  ballot  paper his IC number and give him the ballot  paper.\r\n\r\nThat ballot paper, before it is given to him, is perforated with\r\n\r\na  perforator,  in  the  presence of everybody.   But  with  the\r\n\r\npresent  system, sometimes when the Presiding Officer pulls  out\r\n\r\nthe  perforator, the ballot paper is torn and when the  vote  is\r\n\r\nactually counted, there could be questions about that vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new system, it is the same thing. The Presiding\r\n\r\nOfficer or his assistant will ensure that it is properly stamped\r\n\r\nin  the  presence of the voter that he is indeed the  voter  and\r\n\r\nthat  is  indeed  the  piece  of  paper  from  the  counterfoil,\r\n\r\nperforated,  stamped,  marked or signed.   So  that  process  is\r\n\r\ntotally transparent. He will then take his ballot paper  to  the\r\n\r\nballot box, mark it and put into the box.  If there is any doubt\r\n\r\nat all, the whole process can be questioned there.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, can I clarify with the\r\n\r\nMinister?

I have received\r\n\r\nfeedback that the booth for the marking of the ballot paper does\r\n\r\nnot seem to be private in the sense that somebody may be able to\r\n\r\nsee  how  you mark at the booth.  I wonder whether the Elections\r\n\r\nDepartment will consider improving the booth with maybe  a  box-like enclosure where you have some cover at the back.  Now it is\r\n\r\nquite  exposed.   You can mark, but people will know  where  you\r\n\r\nmark.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> If that is indeed a problem, I will ask\r\n\r\nthe Elections Department to study it.  From what I see, and what\r\n\r\nI have experienced, indeed there is enough space and privacy for\r\n\r\nthe person to hide his ballot paper and mark it.  So there is no\r\n\r\nneed to worry about the secrecy of his vote.  Nobody is going to\r\n\r\npeep at the other person and see what he does with his vote.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill.  -  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment;\r\n\r\nread a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>CRIMINAL LAW (TEMPORARY PROVISIONS)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act was\r\n\r\nenacted  on  21st  October  1955.  Since  then,  Parliament  has\r\n\r\nextended  it  nine times. The last time was five  years  ago  in\r\n\r\n1994.   The  Act will expire on 20th October this year.   Hence,\r\n\r\nthis Bill which seeks to further extend the Act for another five\r\n\r\nyears to enable Government to continue dealing effectively  with\r\n\r\nsecret  society or \"SS\" activities, drug trafficking and serious\r\n\r\ncrimes.   The Bill also seeks to give officers from the  Central\r\n\r\nNarcotics  Bureau  or  \"CNB\" certain  powers  which  the  Police\r\n\r\nalready  has under the Act.  This will enhance CNB's operational\r\n\r\nefficiency and streamline its work process.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Rationale for the Act</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act provides for the maintenance of public order and\r\n\r\ndetention of criminals in the interests of public safety,  peace\r\n\r\nand good order.  Let me, however, emphasise, at the outset, that\r\n\r\nwe  do  not  invoke  the  Act  as a  convenient  alternative  to\r\n\r\nprosecution  in court.  The Government's consistent approach  is\r\n\r\nalways  to  consider a court conviction in the  first  instance.\r\n\r\nHence,   the  vast  majority  of  cases  are  prosecuted.    But\r\n\r\nprosecution  is  not always possible, not because  there  is  no\r\n\r\nevidence, but because witnesses and accomplices are not prepared\r\n\r\nto  testify in court for fear of reprisal or for other  reasons.\r\n\r\nThis  is especially so when accused persons are associated  with\r\n\r\nSS   activities,  organised  crime  gangs  or  drug  trafficking\r\n\r\nsyndicates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS members often refuse to give evidence in court against\r\n\r\nfellow  members.  As for drug traffickers, witnesses are usually\r\n\r\ndrug  addicts  who  refuse  to testify against  their  suppliers\r\n\r\nbecause of their vulnerable status or for fear of reprisal.   An\r\n\r\nadditional difficulty is that traffickers have resorted to using\r\n\r\ncouriers and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngo-betweens to conceal their involvement, thus making it  harder\r\n\r\nto apprehend them.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act's enactment in 1955, it has proven to be an\r\n\r\neffective tool in suppressing SS activities in Singapore.   This\r\n\r\nis  evident  in  the number of SS incidents recorded  by  Police\r\n\r\nwhich has fallen from 416 in 1959, to 10 in 1988, and 3 in 1998.\r\n\r\nThe  number of Detention Orders (DOs) issued against SS  members\r\n\r\nhas also fallen from 72 in 1988, to 42 in 1998.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for drug trafficking, the Act has enabled the CNB to\r\n\r\ncripple  many  drug  syndicates and shatter  their  distribution\r\n\r\nnetworks  in  Singapore.   This  has  contributed  to  the  much\r\n\r\nimproved drug situation today.  As a result, the number  of  DOs\r\n\r\nissued against drug traffickers has also fallen from 192 in 1988\r\n\r\nto 48 last year.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act has also been invoked against criminals who have\r\n\r\ncommitted  serious crimes, such as murder where  witnesses  were\r\n\r\nnot  prepared  to  testify in court.   However,  let  me  assure\r\n\r\nMembers that the Act is used sparingly for these cases.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nthe  last  time the Act was so invoked was in 1994 when  5  Thai\r\n\r\nnationals were detained for their involvement in the murders  of\r\n\r\nsecurity guards and construction workers while committing thefts\r\n\r\nof  surveying equipment or \"theodolites\".  Since then, no DO has\r\n\r\nbeen issued against any serious crime offender.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the number of DOs issued has declined from 270 in\r\n\r\n1988  to  90  in  1998.   The number under  detention  has  also\r\n\r\ndeclined  from  1,260 in 1988 to 463 in 1998.  These  statistics\r\n\r\nprove  the  point  that the Act is effective in  suppressing  SS\r\n\r\nactivities,  drug  trafficking  and  other  organised   criminal\r\n\r\nsyndicates.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it therefore mean that we can now do away with the\r\n\r\nAct?   The  answer is an emphatic \"no\".  The Act still  plays  a\r\n\r\nuseful  role  today.  We cannot be complacent.   Despite  strict\r\n\r\nlaws  and  tough  police enforcement, SS incidents  still  occur\r\n\r\ntoday.   For  example,  in March last year,  a  group  of  triad\r\n\r\nmembers  viciously attacked rival triad members at a  coffeeshop\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngangland weapons, such as home-made samurai swords\r\n\r\nand parangs.  Four innocent customers were seriously injured in\r\n\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no indication that we have completely eliminated\r\n\r\nsecret societies in Singapore.  They still pose a menace.  Apart\r\n\r\nfrom  rioting,  SS  members are involved in syndicated  criminal\r\n\r\nactivities,   such   as  extortion,  illegal  moneylending   and\r\n\r\nsmuggling of illegal immigrants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in May 1997, the Police detected some SS\r\n\r\nmembers extorting `protection' money from contractors soliciting\r\n\r\nfor   renovation  contracts  at  several  new  housing  estates.\r\n\r\nContractors  who  refused  to pay up  were  chased  away.   This\r\n\r\nlucrative  monopoly  led  to  an atmosphere  of  lawlessness  as\r\n\r\ndifferent gangs wrestled for territorial control of the estates.\r\n\r\nThe  gangs'  activities went undetected initially as  victimised\r\n\r\ncontractors kept quiet for fear of reprisal.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police acted swiftly and crippled five `protection rackets'\r\n\r\nbetween  September and December that year.  23 SS  members  were\r\n\r\narrested under the Act.  15 of them were issued with DOs  and  8\r\n\r\nwith  Police  Supervision Orders.  Since then,  Police  has  not\r\n\r\ndetected  any  `protection racket' at new housing estates.   The\r\n\r\nAct  has  therefore provided Police with the arsenal to nip  the\r\n\r\nproblem in the bud.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SS gangs are also involved in illegal moneylending. In\r\n\r\nJune  last year, Police crippled a loanshark syndicate operating\r\n\r\nin  the Geylang area.  The syndicate organiser cum financier had\r\n\r\nrecruited about 50 SS members to be his loansharks and  financed\r\n\r\nsome  of  them.   These  loansharks  assaulted  and  intimidated\r\n\r\ndebtors  and their families, vandalising their property  if  the\r\n\r\nrepayments were late.  The victims could not identify the leader\r\n\r\nbecause he operated behind-the-scene.  He had no direct dealings\r\n\r\nwith  the debtors. It was under these circumstances that  Police\r\n\r\ninvoked  the  Act to detain the organiser cum syndicate  leader,\r\n\r\ntogether with a henchman.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now move on to street gangs. The SS scene today is\r\n\r\ncharacterised  by  loosely-organised  street  gangs  with  fluid\r\n\r\nmembership.  Despite Police action, new gangs are detected every\r\n\r\nyear.  In 1998, 55 street gangs were detected and dealt with  by\r\n\r\nPolice  under  the Act compared to 79 in 1997 and  45  in  1996.\r\n\r\nThese  street gang members are not as vicious as traditional  SS\r\n\r\nmembers  but  they  still fight over trivial  matters,  such  as\r\n\r\nstaring  incidents,  passing of remarks and accidental  contact,\r\n\r\nthus impacting law and order and lowering Singaporeans' sense of\r\n\r\nsafety.   We  must  therefore  deter  these  street  gangs  from\r\n\r\nbecoming  full-fledged secret societies.  Where  necessary,  the\r\n\r\nAct will be used.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have mentioned the above examples to show why,\r\n\r\ndespite  the good law and order situation prevailing today,  the\r\n\r\nAct  is  still  necessary.  Some Singaporeans may  think,  quite\r\n\r\nnaively,  that the Act was enacted in 1955 to deal with  rampant\r\n\r\ngang  lawlessness, and therefore has no further use today.  But,\r\n\r\nSir,  nothing  is as far from the truth.  The setting  may  have\r\n\r\nchanged but the threat remains.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many countries are losing their battle against triads\r\n\r\nbecause  of  the lack of sufficiently deterrent penalties.   The\r\n\r\nrecent  gangland  warfare in Macau is a  grim  reminder  of  the\r\n\r\nviolent  nature of these triad groups.  In an interview reported\r\n\r\nin  the  Straits  Times  on  25th May  1998,  Mr  Victor  Ng,  a\r\n\r\nLegislative Assembly member of the Preparatory Committee set  up\r\n\r\nby  China  to  oversee  Macau's return to  Chinese  sovereignty,\r\n\r\ncommented, and I quote:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The sort of crimes being committed are very serious, and\r\n\r\nthe  government  cannot  control.   It  proves  that  the  Macau\r\n\r\ngovernment has no means, no capacity, to rule Macau in a  lawful\r\n\r\nmanner.'\r\n\r\n<br><br>Another  example,  which those of us who have  followed  in  the\r\n\r\npress  would know, is the murder of Dr Victor Chang, the  world-renowned heart surgeon, in Sydney in 1991.  Two Malaysian  triad\r\n\r\nmembers  were  convicted of killing him because  he  refused  to\r\n\r\naccede  to  their extortion demands.  Again, these are  examples\r\n\r\nwhich highlight the danger of letting\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ntriads gain a foothold in any society.  Law\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies must have sufficient teeth in their legal\r\n\r\narsenal to deter such violent gangs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must therefore constantly be on guard. Police has\r\n\r\nassessed  that there are gangland members in Singapore  and  the\r\n\r\nregion  who are linked to prominent East Asian Gangs  (EAGs)  in\r\n\r\nHong Kong and Taiwan.  But these EAG members are discreet.  They\r\n\r\nare  not  involved  in  triad  activities,  such  as  initiation\r\n\r\nceremonies and extortion.  However, they have the \"muscle\",  the\r\n\r\nmoney and even the firepower to commit cross-border crimes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Police, EAGs consider Singapore to be an\r\n\r\nunattractive operational base.  Police attributes this primarily\r\n\r\nto  the deterring effect of the CL(TP) Act.  But we cannot  rule\r\n\r\nout   the   possibility  of  these  triads  transferring   their\r\n\r\noperations here.  Hence, Singapore needs the CL(TP) Act  as  our\r\n\r\nshield  against  this  potential threat.   Our  law  enforcement\r\n\r\nagencies must be well-equipped to counter any attempts  by  such\r\n\r\ntriad  groups to infiltrate Singapore.   Singapore has, so  far,\r\n\r\nmanaged  to  avoid the many pitfalls currently  faced  by  other\r\n\r\ncountries  in dealing with organised triads and criminal  gangs.\r\n\r\nThe  Act  is  a critical factor in deterring such foreign  gangs\r\n\r\nfrom gaining a foothold in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the drug situation. Drug trafficking is\r\n\r\nan  extremely  lucrative trade.  Drug traffickers and  syndicate\r\n\r\nleaders  have become very sophisticated in their modus operandi.\r\n\r\nThey  stay  clear  from physical drug transactions  by  engaging\r\n\r\nmoney  couriers,  organisers  and recruiters  to  conduct  their\r\n\r\ntrafficking businesses.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the drug situation in Singapore is under\r\n\r\ncontrol,  drug  traffickers  play a high  stakes  life-and-death\r\n\r\ngame.  They will not hesitate to do everything necessary to save\r\n\r\ntheir  own  skins.   We  have  a duty  to  protect  our  people.\r\n\r\nAllowing  the Act to lapse may be misinterpreted as a  softening\r\n\r\nof our tough\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nstance  and  a  weakening  of  our ability  to  deal  with  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking.  This may encourage international drug  trafficking\r\n\r\nsyndicates to use Singapore as a staging point for their illicit\r\n\r\ndrug  activities.  More drugs will then find their  way  to  the\r\n\r\nlocal  population,  resulting in higher `contamination'  levels.\r\n\r\nSuch a scenario has implications on crime.  We should not expose\r\n\r\nourselves to this possibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, SS and drug trafficking activities have declined\r\n\r\nconsiderably  but  the threat of resurgence is  very  real.   We\r\n\r\ntherefore still need the strong deterrence offered by the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having explained why the Act is still necessary today, let\r\n\r\nme  assure  Members that there are safeguards  in  the  process.\r\n\r\nThese safeguards ensure that Police and CNB cannot take the easy\r\n\r\nway  out  by  invoking the Act when a person should  instead  be\r\n\r\ncharged  in court.  They are both built into the Act  itself  as\r\n\r\nwell  as  found in administrative procedures which  ensure  that\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies do not resort to using the Act without  the\r\n\r\nstrongest justification.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, any proposal by Police or CNB to detain a person\r\n\r\nunder  the Act or to place him under police supervision will  be\r\n\r\nscrutinsed by senior officials in MHA and the Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers  and  indeed by the AG before the Detention  or  Police\r\n\r\nSupervision Order is issued.  Departments cannot take  the  easy\r\n\r\nway out.  They have to justify the use of the Act in every case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, an Advisory Committee comprising prominent private\r\n\r\ncitizens such as Justices of the Peace, senior lawyers and a few\r\n\r\ncommunity  leaders scrutinise the investigations and documentary\r\n\r\nevidence  and may examine investigation officers and  witnesses.\r\n\r\nAt  the Committee's hearing, the detainees or supervisees may be\r\n\r\nrepresented   by  legal  counsel.   The  Committee   makes   its\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to  the President.  I must  reiterate  that  the\r\n\r\nCommittee  is  not  a rubber-stamping body.  Over  the  past  10\r\n\r\nyears, the Committee has disagreed\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nwith  MHA's  recommendations  on 12 occasions,  by  recommending\r\n\r\ninstead that DOs be either revoked or changed to PSOs.  We  have\r\n\r\ntaken  the  objections seriously and accepted  the  majority  of\r\n\r\nthese recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, DOs are reviewed annually by a separate Review\r\n\r\nCommittee,  also comprising prominent private citizens.   Hence,\r\n\r\nno  detainee  is  just locked up and the key thrown  away.   The\r\n\r\nReview Advisory Committee members are distinct from the Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee,    ensuring    independent   decision-making.     Any\r\n\r\nrecommendation  to extend the detention for a  further  12-month\r\n\r\nperiod must be approved by the President.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fourth, a separate Review Board, also with a different\r\n\r\nset of members, considers all cases of detention cases extending\r\n\r\n10  years  or  more.   This  process ensures  that  longer  term\r\n\r\ndetainees' cases are specially looked at.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this exercise of coming before Parliament every 5\r\n\r\nyears  to renew the Act is an additional safeguard.  An Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  Chairman has asked why the Act is temporary  and  not\r\n\r\npermanent.  The reason is that, this way, the Government has  to\r\n\r\ncome  to the House to justify the continued use of the Act every\r\n\r\n5 years.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, let me assure this House that where there are\r\n\r\nwitnesses  willing  to  testify in court,  we  will  charge  the\r\n\r\nculprits in court.  But where victims and accomplices refuse  to\r\n\r\ntestify  in  open  court,  the CL(TP)  Act  prevents  the  chief\r\n\r\noffenders  from getting away scot-free.  Even when invoked,  the\r\n\r\nAct is not used as a blunt instrument.  Depending on the gravity\r\n\r\nof the offence, either a Detention Order or a Police Supervision\r\n\r\nOrder  would be issued.  Therefore, this allows for the exercise\r\n\r\nof flexibility based on the facts of each case.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the proposed amendments to the Act.\r\n\r\nCurrently,  only  Police officers are empowered  to  arrest  and\r\n\r\ndetain  a  suspect without a warrant for not more than 24  hours\r\n\r\nunder  section 44 of the Act.  Section 44(2) of the Act  further\r\n\r\nempowers a police officer of the rank of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAssistant  Superintendent  of Police  or  above  to  extend  the\r\n\r\ndetention period for another 24 hours.  Under section  44(3)  of\r\n\r\nthe Act, a Police officer of or above the rank of Superintendent\r\n\r\nof  Police  may authorise further detention up to  14  days  for\r\n\r\ninvestigation  into  the  case to be completed.   Under  current\r\n\r\npractice, CNB must obtain authorisation from a Police officer of\r\n\r\nthe  appropriate  rank  to arrest and detain  a  suspected  drug\r\n\r\ntrafficker  under the Act.  CNB investigates a large  number  of\r\n\r\ndrug  trafficking cases under the Act  -  51 in 1997 and  48  in\r\n\r\n1998.   The  requirement  for CNB to obtain  authorisation  from\r\n\r\nPolice hampers CNB's effectiveness and efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, it is proposed that Part V of the Act be\r\n\r\namended  to give CNB officers powers, similar to that of  Police\r\n\r\nofficers,  to  arrest and detain suspected drug traffickers  and\r\n\r\npersons  who  had  assisted  these traffickers  in  one  way  or\r\n\r\nanother,  eg, in collecting monies.  A new section 46A  will  be\r\n\r\nintroduced   to  empower  the  Director,  Deputy  Director   and\r\n\r\nAssistant  Directors  and other Narcotics Officers  of  CNB,  to\r\n\r\nexercise  the powers conferred on Police officers to detain  and\r\n\r\narrest  suspected persons, and to enter and search  premises  to\r\n\r\neffect  arrest.   Under section 46A(2), any CNB officer  holding\r\n\r\nthe  appointment of Assistant Director or above may exercise the\r\n\r\npowers  conferred  on  a  Police officer  holding  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nAssistant  Superintendent of Police  or  above.   Under  section\r\n\r\n46A(3), the Director or Deputy Director of CNB may exercise  the\r\n\r\npowers  conferred  on  a  Police officer  holding  the  rank  of\r\n\r\nSuperintendent of Police or above.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a right move. CNB officers, like Police\r\n\r\nofficers,  are responsible law enforcement officers.   In  fact,\r\n\r\ncurrently, CNB officers can already exercise powers of a  police\r\n\r\nofficer  under  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code  in  relation  to\r\n\r\ninvestigation  of drug offences under the Misuse of  Drugs  Act.\r\n\r\nHence, this amendment plugs a gap.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these amendments will allow CNB to be more efficient.\r\n\r\nThe  enhanced powers will only apply to drug trafficking-related\r\n\r\ncases, unless approved by the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister.   The  Director and Deputy Director  of  CNB  will  be\r\n\r\nresponsible  for authorising investigations related to  Criminal\r\n\r\nLaw   cases.   These  enhanced  powers  will  thus  be   tightly\r\n\r\ncontrolled.  As in the case of police officers, any  abuse  will\r\n\r\nbe severely dealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nsupport the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has always been recognised as one of the safest\r\n\r\ncities to live in.  We have been enjoying a relatively low crime\r\n\r\nrate  and free from any major organised crime activities.   This\r\n\r\nfact  has been acknowledged by almost any visitor who is  living\r\n\r\nin  or  visited our country.  It is because our Government takes\r\n\r\nthe  maintenance  of  public safety, peace  and  good  order  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  seriously.  We come down hard on criminals,  although\r\n\r\nour   policy  in  crime  and  punishment  may  have  drawn  some\r\n\r\ncriticisms  from  the west.  We have never  apologised  for  our\r\n\r\nstand to punish criminals severely in order to protect victims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well known fact that some major crimes such as drug\r\n\r\ntrafficking, gambling, prostitution are secret society  related.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the menace of secret societies has been under  control\r\n\r\nsince  the 60s and 70s, we must, however, be vigilant to  ensure\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  kept under control at all  times,  as  we  face\r\n\r\nconstant threat that their activities may surface not only  from\r\n\r\nwithin but from the surrounding region.  It is not unknown  that\r\n\r\nfrom  time to time, our police have detected importation of such\r\n\r\nsecret society activities from as far as Hong Kong and Taiwan.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to have secret societies under control in\r\n\r\norder  to  keep  major  crime  rates  low.   The  Criminal   Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary  Provisions) Act has to be extended  because  of  its\r\n\r\neffectiveness  in  dealing with persons associated  with  secret\r\n\r\nsocieties, drug trafficking and other subversive activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue and ask why our courts cannot deal with such\r\n\r\ncriminals.  Again, it is a well established fact that because of\r\n\r\nthe depth of influence and the intimidating tactics these secret\r\n\r\nsocieties employ on the ordinary citizens are so effective, very\r\n\r\noften  no  witnesses  are willing or dare  to  come  forward  to\r\n\r\ntestify and therefore even if they are caught and every evidence\r\n\r\npoints to their guilt, the culprit will often be set free.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps one of the most illustrative examples of this is in\r\n\r\nthe  case  of the famous American gangster, Al Capone.  Everyone\r\n\r\nin  America  knew  that  he  was  the  most  notorious  criminal\r\n\r\ncontrolling  almost the whole underground during the prohibition\r\n\r\nperiod.   Despite  all  the efforts by  the  most  powerful  law\r\n\r\nenforcement agencies in the US, including the FBI, CIA,  Police,\r\n\r\nDA,  at the end, they could only succeed in convicting him on  a\r\n\r\nlesser  charge  under the IRA Act.  Therefore, I have  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat in order to ensure a peaceful and safe environment in which\r\n\r\nour   citizens'  well-being  is  protected,  the  Criminal   Law\r\n\r\n(Temporary Provisions) Act has to continue to be one of the very\r\n\r\nimportant  law  enforcement  tools  to  be  used  against   such\r\n\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the new section 46A in the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\nIt  is  only logical that the CNB officers should be  given  the\r\n\r\nsame  powers conferred upon a police officer, so that  they  can\r\n\r\ncarry  out  their  duties in dealing with  drug  offenders  with\r\n\r\ngreater efficiency and effectiveness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who argue that there may be abuse of such Act on\r\n\r\nthe innocent, so far, it has not been proven that any person has\r\n\r\nbeen detained arbitrarily or wrongfully.  This is because of the\r\n\r\nsafeguards  built into the Act that every case will be  reviewed\r\n\r\nby the Advisory Committee consisting of people from all walks of\r\n\r\nlife, from senior members of the Bar, professionals, Justices of\r\n\r\nPeace, academics, etc, to ensure that the decision is made by  a\r\n\r\ncross-section of prominent citizens after a thorough review.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister whether the\r\n\r\nreview report can be\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndisclosed  upon request, if necessary, to ensure that the  whole\r\n\r\nprocess  is  truly  transparent,  thus  eliminating  any   doubt\r\n\r\nwhatsoever  in the manner of administering the Act, and  whether\r\n\r\nthe  identity of the persons who are appointed to this  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee  could be made public, so as to lay to rest any  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the Act can be abused.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving\r\n\r\nme this opportunity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As students of law, the concept of fairness and natural\r\n\r\njustice is ingrained in us.  We learn very early in school  that\r\n\r\nno man shall be condemned without a fair hearing.  The fact that\r\n\r\nthis law has a long life in the statute book and is still called\r\n\r\ntemporary  provisions is reflective of our philosophy.   I  hope\r\n\r\nthat  this will truly be temporary provisions but I am  sanguine\r\n\r\nenough  to believe that the law will be in existence for a  long\r\n\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1955, Sir, William Goode, the then Colonial Secretary,\r\n\r\nmoved  the Second Reading of the Bill.  Communist terrorism  was\r\n\r\non  the  rise  and  secret societies were a menace  to  society.\r\n\r\nThere  was no alternative.  The British, who believe in  natural\r\n\r\njustice, had no choice but to introduce this law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most heartening things I would like to\r\n\r\nshare  in  this House is the confidence the public  has  in  our\r\n\r\nPolice Force.  I agree with the Minister that no person has been\r\n\r\npersecuted.   Every case is thoroughly examined.   But  I  agree\r\n\r\nwith  Mr  Kenneth  Chen  that we should try  to  work  out  some\r\n\r\ntransparency in the system.  I am not for a moment doubting that\r\n\r\nour  system is far from fair.  We should improve on the  system.\r\n\r\nThe  last  time the Bill came before this House, there was  some\r\n\r\nsuggestion.  I reiterate it again, Sir.  The Minister will still\r\n\r\nbe  responsible for the appointment of members of  the  advisory\r\n\r\ncommittee.  But may I ask that he invite the Academy of Law  and\r\n\r\nthe   Chambers  of  Commerce  to  nominate  one  person  to  the\r\n\r\ncommittee.  In this way,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npublic confidence will be further increased.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite a very strong effort by the Police Force and\r\n\r\nthe  schools,  we find that street corner gangs are  increasing.\r\n\r\nSecret  society activities have moved even to our  schools,  and\r\n\r\nthis is most unfortunate.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the reasons why people are prepared to come and\r\n\r\ninvest in this country is because we have law and order.  And  I\r\n\r\nthink this is the safest country in the world, and we must  make\r\n\r\nit  that way.  I would have no hesitation in giving the power to\r\n\r\nthe  Minister, knowing full well that this power will  never  be\r\n\r\nabused.  As a practising lawyer, I have had opportunities in the\r\n\r\nearlier days of my practice to represent some of these cases.  A\r\n\r\nparent would come and tell us, \"Oh, my son is innocent.  Nothing\r\n\r\nhas  gone wrong.\"  And when you face the advisory committee, the\r\n\r\ntruth  is  there, and the truth is always that the  Police  have\r\n\r\ndone  their  work thoroughly.  As the Minister has pointed  out,\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General's Chambers is consulted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to maintain the record of the safest city in\r\n\r\nthe  world, may I urge the Minister to take the necessary steps.\r\n\r\nWhile the law will still be there, we must allow the educational\r\n\r\nprocess to go on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wholeheartedly support the proposed amendment to\r\n\r\ninclude  section 46A.  I think more than secret societies,  drug\r\n\r\npushers  and  traffickers  are the most  dangerous  and  heinous\r\n\r\ncriminals in the world, and their tentacles spread all over  the\r\n\r\nworld,   in   million  dollar  businesses  and  million   dollar\r\n\r\noperations.   We must do everything to assist the  international\r\n\r\nagencies and ourselves.  We are going to have the world at large\r\n\r\nif  we  can  see  that this place is clean from these  dangerous\r\n\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have said earlier, as a lawyer, I am in a dilemma\r\n\r\nwhether  to support this Bill when I look at fundamental issues.\r\n\r\nBut  when  I study the reality of the situation, I find  that  I\r\n\r\ncannot but agree wholeheartedly with the Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill and I hope the House will support\r\n\r\nit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank both Mr\r\n\r\nKenneth Chen and Mr Rai for supporting the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, what they say is correct. The role of the\r\n\r\nprivate citizens in the process is important, because they  play\r\n\r\nan  important role to ensure that the process is indeed fair and\r\n\r\nthat  there  is no abuse.  When we talk about transparency,  the\r\n\r\nfact  is  that the process, raison d'etre, is that witnesses  do\r\n\r\nnot  want to testify.  So that circumscribes the extent to which\r\n\r\nthere can be transparency.  But all the committees do their work\r\n\r\ncarefully,  fairly, examining every case and, as  I  have  said,\r\n\r\nthose   cases  where  the  committee  has  disagreed  with   the\r\n\r\nMinistry's  order, we have also looked at their  recommendations\r\n\r\nand in some of them, we have followed the committee's views.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Rai asked whether we should in fact have designated\r\n\r\nappointing authorities where we can invite recommendations,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  from  the Chambers of Commerce or  whatever.   Let  me\r\n\r\nassure Mr Rai that the Ministry of Home Affairs takes much  care\r\n\r\nin  surveying the field to look at who is available and  who  is\r\n\r\nsuitable.   If we were to take his suggestion, we  are  in  fact\r\n\r\nrestricting our flexibility.  Let us leave it this way where  we\r\n\r\ndo  look  at the composition of the various committees  and  the\r\n\r\nkind  of work they do.  We will continue to have a good  mix  of\r\n\r\nprominent  people who have proven themselves in various  fields.\r\n\r\nLike  I  have  said before, there are 37 prominent citizens,  of\r\n\r\nwhom 11 are Justices of the Peace and about 30 lawyers.  In  the\r\n\r\nnature of the task at hand, there will be a need for lawyers  to\r\n\r\nbe  there to examine the evidence available.  At the same  time,\r\n\r\nit  is  also good to get other views.  Therefore, there is  this\r\n\r\nmix.  So let us leave it at that.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think Mr Kenneth Chen's suggestion is worth\r\n\r\nconsidering.  He asks whether we could have some publicity as to\r\n\r\nwho these people are.  That will instill\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nsome confidence in the system because a lot depends\r\n\r\non them. We can consider that.  The next time the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHome Affairs appoints or reappoints members to the various\r\n\r\ncommittees, we can consider making these appointments public.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a\r\n\r\nCommittee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on\r\n\r\nthe Bill. - [Assoc.

Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b>\r\n\r\nMr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be  now  read  a\r\n\r\nSecond time\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Act (Chapter 248\r\n\r\nof  the 1985 Revised Edition) was passed in 1980 to provide  for\r\n\r\nthe  control,  licensing and inspection  of  private  hospitals,\r\n\r\nmedical  clinics  and  clinical  laboratories  and  to  prohibit\r\n\r\ntrading  in human blood.  The Act came into operation  when  its\r\n\r\nregulations were gazetted in 1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act was passed in 1980 when most hospitals were run by\r\n\r\nthe  Government  and the Act did not apply to  them.   With  the\r\n\r\nrestructuring of Government hospitals, the conversion  of  homes\r\n\r\nfor  the  aged into nursing homes and the increasing  number  of\r\n\r\nprivate  hospitals, clinics and clinical laboratories being  set\r\n\r\nup,  it  was  necessary  to implement the  law  to  oversee  the\r\n\r\noperation of these healthcare institutions and uphold  the  high\r\n\r\nstandard  of medical care in Singapore. Regulations to  the  Act\r\n\r\nwere  finalised and  the Act came into operation  in  1991.   My\r\n\r\nMinistry  then  established the Medical Audit and  Accreditation\r\n\r\nUnit  (MAAU)  to  license  all private healthcare  institutions,\r\n\r\nincluding   the   restructured  hospitals,  to  regulate   their\r\n\r\nprofessional standards and to audit their clinical activities.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With recent changes in medical practice and rapid advance\r\n\r\nin  medical  technologies, there is need for some amendments  to\r\n\r\nthe  legislative  framework under which MAAU  works.   Before  I\r\n\r\nbrief the House on the amendments to the Bill in detail, let  me\r\n\r\npresent  the three main objectives that my Ministry  intends  to\r\n\r\nachieve with these amendments.  They are:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to ensure a high level of professional standard\r\n\r\npractised at health care establishments;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to provide for greater flexibility in licensing the\r\n\r\nestablishments; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to enhance our capability for regulatory enforcement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will help to ensure a high level of professional\r\n\r\nstandard by providing, firstly, for :\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) more effective quality assurance (QA) programmes at\r\n\r\nhealth care establishments; and,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) more effective medical audits carried out by my\r\n\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;QA programmes comprise a range of activities directed at\r\n\r\nensuring  the  quality  of patient care  through  objective  and\r\n\r\nsystematic  monitoring, evaluation, identification  of  problems\r\n\r\nand  action  to improve the level and appropriateness  of  care.\r\n\r\nThe  programmes  are by and large institutional  activities  for\r\n\r\nself-monitoring purposes.   These have been established  in  all\r\n\r\nhospitals   as   a   requirement   for   licensing   since   the\r\n\r\nimplementation of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics  Act\r\n\r\nin 1991.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry monitors closely these activities by requiring\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  submit  regular six monthly returns  on  clinical\r\n\r\nperformance  indicators such as unexpected deaths; perioperative\r\n\r\ndeaths;  unplanned  re-admissions to  hospitals;  and  unplanned\r\n\r\nreturns  to the operating theatres, and so on.  We also  require\r\n\r\nsix  monthly returns on any report of Committees of Inquiry into\r\n\r\nmedical incidents as well as the results of tissue audit.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of these returns are then closely scrutinised\r\n\r\nby  my  Ministry  and in-depth medical audits are  conducted  if\r\n\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is important to retain the self-monitoring element\r\n\r\nin  QA  programmes, they are, however, based on  a  peer  review\r\n\r\nprocess which requires doctors to evaluate and pass judgement on\r\n\r\neach  other's  professional performance.   Understandably,  many\r\n\r\ndoctors  have  been reluctant to participate  in  QA  committees\r\n\r\nbecause  firstly,  the  findings of a  QA  committee  under  the\r\n\r\ncurrent  provision  of the law are open to legal  discovery  and\r\n\r\ncould  provide the basis for legal action against the  hospital.\r\n\r\nSecondly, QA committee members are exposed to personal liability\r\n\r\nfor  the  opinions they have expressed and to  legal  suits  for\r\n\r\ndefamation by aggrieved doctors.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But QA programmes must have the active involvement of\r\n\r\ndoctors  to be effective.  There is therefore a need to formally\r\n\r\nrecognise  the  roles  and functions of  QA  committees  and  to\r\n\r\nprovide the necessary safeguards for the hospital and members of\r\n\r\nthe  QA committees that will facilitate the conduct of effective\r\n\r\nQA  programmes.  Countries like Australia and the United  States\r\n\r\nhave   also  recognised  the  importance  of  effective  quality\r\n\r\nassurance programmes in health care and have enacted legislation\r\n\r\nto address these legal issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill lays down more definitive requirements for\r\n\r\nhospital  QA  programmes.   It will also enable the Minister  to\r\n\r\nmake  regulations  on  the composition, procedures,  duties  and\r\n\r\nresponsibilities of QA committees in hospitals and other  health\r\n\r\ncare establishments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will, secondly, enable my Ministry to conduct more\r\n\r\neffective  medical  audit  programmes.   To  ensure  that   high\r\n\r\nstandards  of  professional  practice  are  maintained,  it   is\r\n\r\nnecessary for my Ministry to conduct medical audits to  evaluate\r\n\r\nthe medical treatment that has been given to patients.  To do so\r\n\r\neffectively,  my  Ministry must have  access  to  the  patient's\r\n\r\nmedical records so that the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nclinical  data,  investigations performed, treatment  prescribed\r\n\r\nand  the  outcomes  of clinical management  can  be  objectively\r\n\r\nreviewed and assessed for their quality and appropriateness.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, section 12(3) of the existing Act prohibits access\r\n\r\nto  a  patient's  medical  records  except  with  the  patient's\r\n\r\nconsent.   This  prohibition  is  unduly  restrictive  for   the\r\n\r\npurposes  of  statutory  medical  audit.   Medical  audits   are\r\n\r\nconducted  mostly on common medical conditions, and this  should\r\n\r\nbe done before any conclusion is reached on the quality of care.\r\n\r\nObtaining  the patient's consent at this stage will  potentially\r\n\r\ncause undue alarm to the patient, and may raise doubts that some\r\n\r\nerror  in  medical management has occurred, where none may  have\r\n\r\nbeen  made at all.  The need for the patient's consent  is  also\r\n\r\nnot  practical  when  a  large number of a  particular  type  of\r\n\r\npatients   is  studied.   For  example,  when  we  audited   the\r\n\r\nappropriateness and outcome of caesarean sections performed  for\r\n\r\npregnant  women under different clinical situations, we  took  a\r\n\r\nrandom sample of 10%.   In 1997, out of 46,000 deliveries,  some\r\n\r\n12,600 or 27% were by caesarian section.  A 10% sample for  1997\r\n\r\ntherefore entailed a study of 1,200 cases of caesarian sections.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impractical to ask each and every patient chosen\r\n\r\nin  the  sample  for  her  consent to have  her  medical  record\r\n\r\nexamined.  It will be more practical to allow access to  medical\r\n\r\nrecords  specifically  and  only for the  purpose  of  statutory\r\n\r\nmedical audit, while at the same time safeguarding the principle\r\n\r\nof  medical  confidentiality.  I  want  to  emphasise  that  the\r\n\r\nobjective  of having access to the medical records  is  for  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  studying the pattern of management of a  particular\r\n\r\ngroup  of  patients and not for identification of the individual\r\n\r\npatient.   The  identity  of  the individual  is  protected  and\r\n\r\nsafeguarded under new provisions of the Bill (clause 10, section\r\n\r\n12), which I will elaborate on later.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is selectively auditing areas of clinical\r\n\r\npractice where there is a large\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nnumber  of patients or high volume, where the cost is high,  and\r\n\r\nwhere  there may be a potential for `errant practice'.  Examples\r\n\r\nof  areas  being audited are caesarean sections, hysterectomies,\r\n\r\nendoscopies, arthroscopies and balloon angioplasties.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the audits done so far have shown that there is a\r\n\r\nvery  high degree of conformity with acceptable \"best practice\".\r\n\r\nThis  is  to the great credit of our medical profession.   Where\r\n\r\n`deviations'  are  found,  for  example,  with  indications  for\r\n\r\nperforming  caesarean  sections,  the  doctors  or  professional\r\n\r\nbodies  are  given  feedback  to enable  corrective  action  and\r\n\r\nimprovement of practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the manner in which healthcare is delivered is\r\n\r\nevolving  rapidly.   The second objective  of  the  Bill  is  to\r\n\r\nprovide  for  greater  flexibility in  licensing  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishments.  The Act currently provides for only three types\r\n\r\nof licences:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Hospital licences for hospitals, nursing homes and\r\n\r\nmaternity homes;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Medical clinic licences for medical and dental clinics;\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Clinical laboratory licences.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Act was passed, new types of health care\r\n\r\nestablishments  have  emerged, for example, ambulatory  surgical\r\n\r\ntreatment  centres, renal dialysis clinics and MRI  centres.   I\r\n\r\nhave  no  doubt  that  this  trend of new  types  of  healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishments being set up will continue.  There is therefore a\r\n\r\nneed to build greater flexibility into the Act for the licensing\r\n\r\nof  new  health  care establishments which can  then  be  better\r\n\r\ncontrolled through their own specific regulations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective of the Bill is to enhance my Ministry's\r\n\r\npower  of enforcement.  The existing Act only allows my Ministry\r\n\r\nto inspect health care establishments but does not allow for the\r\n\r\nseizure   of   evidence  which  is  frequently   necessary   for\r\n\r\nprosecution.  The revision of the Private Hospitals and  Medical\r\n\r\nClinics Act  will facilitate the enforcement work of my Ministry\r\n\r\nby allowing the seizure of evidence during raids especially on\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nunlicensed premises.  Presently, we have to rely  on\r\n\r\nthe  police  to  exercise such powers.  This is  an  unnecessary\r\n\r\nburden  on  the  police  and  can be removed  by  enhancing  the\r\n\r\ninvestigative powers of the officers acting under the  authority\r\n\r\nof the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, all offences under the Act require prosecution\r\n\r\nin  court  before  any  penalty can be  imposed.    For  greater\r\n\r\nflexibility  in  enforcement, there is a  need  to  provide  for\r\n\r\ncomposition of offences especially for the more minor ones.  The\r\n\r\npenalties for offences under the Act also need to be updated.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will now brief the House on the main provisions of\r\n\r\nthe Bill which will address the concerns I have listed earlier.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 10 is\r\n\r\nenacted   to  require  the  setting  up  of  quality   assurance\r\n\r\ncommittees in hospitals.  To facilitate the conduct of effective\r\n\r\nquality  assurance  programmes  in  hospitals  and  health  care\r\n\r\nestablishments, the section provides that:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Documents arising from the deliberations of quality\r\n\r\nassurance committees cannot be compelled to be divulged  to  any\r\n\r\ncourt, tribunal, board or person;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Findings and recommendations made by quality assurance\r\n\r\ncommittees  on  changes to be made to practices,  in  particular\r\n\r\nhealthcare  establishments, shall not be used as  evidence  that\r\n\r\nthe service or practice was inadequate or inappropriate; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Members of quality assurance committees are protected\r\n\r\nfrom  personal liability when they exercise their duties in good\r\n\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are similar to legislation which has been\r\n\r\nenacted  in  the United States and in Australia  to  support  QA\r\n\r\nprogrammes in health care.  These two countries have also  drawn\r\n\r\nup  legislation to prevent forced legal disclosure of QA matters\r\n\r\nin  hospitals  and other healthcare establishments.   They  have\r\n\r\nalso enacted legislation to protect members of QA\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommittees from personal liability when they act in good faith.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 of the Amendment Bill also amends section 17 of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  to  allow  the  Minister to make  regulations  on  the\r\n\r\ncomposition,  procedures,  duties  and  responsibilities  of  QA\r\n\r\ncommittees of healthcare establishments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, another new section\r\n\r\n11  is  enacted which provides for the access to medical records\r\n\r\nof  patients  notwithstanding that  the  prior  consent  of  the\r\n\r\npatient has not been obtained in order to:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) investigate whether this Act or any regulations made\r\n\r\nthereunder has been or is being contravened; or\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to assess the quality and appropriateness of the\r\n\r\nservices provided and the practices and procedures being carried\r\n\r\nout at the healthcare establishment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the existing Act which requires the patient's\r\n\r\nconsent  for  access  to medical records is therefore  repealed.\r\n\r\nThe new section 11 stipulates that the access to medical records\r\n\r\nwithout  consent  is  allowed only for medical  audit  purposes.\r\n\r\nAccess  to medical records is also strictly confined to officers\r\n\r\nauthorised by the Director of Medical Services.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a third new section,\r\n\r\nsection  12,  is  enacted  to  prevent  the  disclosure  of  any\r\n\r\ninformation  contained in a patient's medical record  which  has\r\n\r\ncome to the knowledge of the Director of Medical Services or  an\r\n\r\nauthorised  officer in the course of performing any  duty  under\r\n\r\nthis  Act.   This provision safeguards the need for  doctors  to\r\n\r\nmaintain confidentiality of medical information.  It provides an\r\n\r\nessential  balance  to  the provision  which  allows  access  to\r\n\r\npatients' medical records by authorised officers.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 12 only allows for disclosure of medical\r\n\r\ninformation  for  specific  statutory  purposes  such   as   for\r\n\r\ndisciplinary proceedings under the Medical Registration  Act  or\r\n\r\nthe Dentists\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nAct.  The maximum penalty for wrongful disclosure of information\r\n\r\nunder  the  Act  has  been increased from a fine  of  $2,000  to\r\n\r\n$5,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 3 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 2A is\r\n\r\nenacted  to allow the Director of Medical Services to  authorise\r\n\r\nany  person  to assist in the administration of the  Act.   This\r\n\r\nsection also provides for the Minister to establish one or  more\r\n\r\nadvisory  committees  to  advise on matters  pertaining  to  the\r\n\r\nadministration of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 16B is\r\n\r\nenacted  to  protect  all  authorised officers  and  members  of\r\n\r\nadvisory  committees from legal liability for anything which  is\r\n\r\ndone in good faith in the performance of their duties under  the\r\n\r\nAct.  These amendments ensure that the appointed medical experts\r\n\r\nare  adequately  protected  from any  personal  or  professional\r\n\r\nliability in the exercise of their responsibility and judgement.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 2 of the Amendment Bill, section 2 of the Act\r\n\r\nis   amended   to  include  the  definition  of   a   healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishment as any premises or conveyance which is declared by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  to  be  an establishment that requires  licensing\r\n\r\nunder  this Act.  This will give my Ministry the flexibility  to\r\n\r\nlicense  new  types  of healthcare establishments  as  and  when\r\n\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 10 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 11\r\n\r\nprovides   the  Director  of  Medical  Services  and  authorised\r\n\r\nofficers  with additional powers to seize evidence, make  copies\r\n\r\nor take extracts from relevant records or require the persons in\r\n\r\ncharge  of  licensed establishments to do so when enforcing  the\r\n\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 13 of the Amendment Bill, a new section 16D is\r\n\r\nenacted to allow for the composition of offences up to a maximum\r\n\r\nof $2,000.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill updates the penalties for various\r\n\r\noffences  under the Act, and proposes a couple of new  offences,\r\n\r\nsuch\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nas  the  failure  of an unlicensed healthcare  establishment  to\r\n\r\ncomply with an order to close the establishment; and failure  to\r\n\r\ncomply  with  an  order to stop using an equipment  or  to  stop\r\n\r\ncarrying out a practice deemed dangerous or unsuitable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, medical knowledge, medical technology and medical\r\n\r\npractice have changed and advanced tremendously in the last  two\r\n\r\ndecades  and  will continue to evolve into the  new  millennium.\r\n\r\nNew   diseases  pose  new  challenges  that  will  present   new\r\n\r\nmodalities of treatment and new approaches to patient care.   In\r\n\r\nthe  midst  of  these changes, there will always be  a  need  to\r\n\r\nensure  that a high level of professional standard is upheld  in\r\n\r\nhealthcare establishments.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in this Bill will strengthen the\r\n\r\nregulatory  framework so that we can meet these challenges  with\r\n\r\nconfidence and achieve our goal of providing good quality health\r\n\r\ncare to Singaporeans that is appropriate to their needs.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.

The extensive amendments\r\n\r\nare  welcome as they suitably update the 1995 Edition of the Act\r\n\r\nto cater for the vast\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nchanges in the healthcare industry.  It would appear to me  that\r\n\r\nthe main crux of this Amendment Bill seeks to rope in control of\r\n\r\nthe so-called \"healthcare establishments\".  I would suggest that\r\n\r\nthe  words  \"healthcare establishments\"  be  inserted  into  the\r\n\r\npreamble  of  the  original Act.  Sir, this  notwithstanding,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to seek clarification on several other  matters  in\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the Senior Minister of State for Health clarify on\r\n\r\none  of  the  main  objectives of licensing the various  private\r\n\r\nhealthcare  establishments, laboratories, clinics and  hospitals\r\n\r\nin  Singapore  as provided in this Bill?  Is the  assurance  for\r\n\r\nquality  of  such  premises or the control of quantity  of  such\r\n\r\npremises the priority?  Sir, my concern is that with the latter,\r\n\r\nwe  shall create, in the future, a tradable commodity for  those\r\n\r\nlicences of existing practices.  This will pose difficulties for\r\n\r\nyoung  doctors  to  set  up  new  medical  practices  and  other\r\n\r\nhealthcare  personnel and concerns to set  up  laboratories  and\r\n\r\nhospitals.   The  problem  may  be  further  compounded  if  the\r\n\r\ncontrolled  and  restricted numbers of  licences  from  existing\r\n\r\nholders invariably become scarce commodities.  Mr Speaker,  Sir,\r\n\r\nI  would  like  to know if the licensing mechanism  will  enable\r\n\r\nbetter  distribution of healthcare establishments in  Singapore.\r\n\r\nLet  us  be  reminded of a past incident where six clinics  were\r\n\r\nopened  in  the same block of an estate.  No doubt, the  problem\r\n\r\nthen was due to the \"tender scheme\" for HDB shops.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the amendment of section 2 under clause 2(b), the\r\n\r\ndefinition  of  \"healthcare establishment\" as  any  premises  or\r\n\r\nconveyance  (not  being a private hospital,  medical  clinic  or\r\n\r\nclinical   laboratory  or  part  thereof,  and  not   being   an\r\n\r\nestablishment or conveyance maintained by the Government or  the\r\n\r\nNational  University  of Singapore) that  aims  to  provide  the\r\n\r\nservices  stated  would mean that a wide range  of  premises  or\r\n\r\nconveyance  will fall within the ambit of the Act.   Sir,  would\r\n\r\nthe  Senior Minister of State for Health confirm whether a wider\r\n\r\ndefinition  like  this is intended so that  traditional  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedical clinics, acupuncture centres,\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nhealth spas, and the like, can be included for licensing?   That\r\n\r\nthese   establishments  may  provide  or  attempt   to   provide\r\n\r\ndiagnosis,  treatment,  or care of persons  suffering  from  any\r\n\r\ndisease, injury, or disability is indisputable.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud the provision for Quality Assurance Committees in\r\n\r\nnew  section  10 to enhance and ensure the quality standards  at\r\n\r\nprivate hospitals and healthcare establishments.  This amendment\r\n\r\nprovides for transparency in quality control and reassurance  to\r\n\r\nrecipients of healthcare in Singapore.  New subsection 10(3)  is\r\n\r\ngood,   as  this  will  give  protection  to  quality  assurance\r\n\r\ncommittee  members  and will facilitate their  unrestrained  and\r\n\r\nefficient contributions.  My concern is on new subsection  10(4)\r\n\r\nin  that  the minutes of the meetings can be made available  for\r\n\r\nany  proceedings.   Will these not erode the protection  to  the\r\n\r\nsaid members in any proceeding?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to the implementation of the Act, I would like to\r\n\r\nurge  the  Senior  Minister of State for  Health  to  cause  her\r\n\r\nMinistry to be mindful of two issues:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A surfeit of fees chargeable for various licences. For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  the case of a medical practitioner,  besides  the\r\n\r\n$600  fee for the clinic licence every two years, there are fees\r\n\r\nfor  the  practising  certificate, medical insurance,  equipment\r\n\r\nlike  an  ultrasound machine, and so on.  All these  add  up  to\r\n\r\nhigher  costs and run counter to our aspirations of  containment\r\n\r\nof  healthcare  cost.  Would the Minister consider  waiving  the\r\n\r\nfees or at least keeping them reasonably low?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The new section 11 gives the Director or an authorised\r\n\r\nofficer  very  wide  powers to enter,  search  and  inspect  any\r\n\r\npremises and to ask a licensee to furnish information.  Although\r\n\r\nwe  can  understand that such powers are necessary to facilitate\r\n\r\nchecking and compliance, I hope the licensees are not subject to\r\n\r\nexcessive   demands   for  inspections,  data   collection   and\r\n\r\nsubmission  or  for surveys and audits.  These  can  be  counter\r\n\r\nproductive   insofar   as  they  are  fundamentally   laborious,\r\n\r\ndisruptive and expensive.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this Amendment Bill will enable the\r\n\r\nMinistry to fulfil an effective \"watchdog\" role.  Sir, I support\r\n\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.  I agree,\r\n\r\nin  principle,  with the main thrust of the  Bill  which  is  to\r\n\r\nregulate  the standards of medical care in the interest  of  the\r\n\r\npublic.   Although this Bill is intended to enforce good medical\r\n\r\naudit  on healthcare institutions that are \"western\" in  medical\r\n\r\norientation  and treatment, I urge the Minister  to  expand  its\r\n\r\nscope to regulate non-western and experimental health practices.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past few years, we observe the growth of a grey\r\n\r\nspectrum  of  healthcare practices which some call  \"alternative\r\n\r\nmedicine\" and others call \"complementary health systems\".   Some\r\n\r\nare  more acceptable forms of alternative medicines like Chinese\r\n\r\nherbal   treatment,  homeopathy  and  acupuncture  which   apply\r\n\r\ndifferent  modalities towards health recovery.  There  are  also\r\n\r\nthe  high-tech \"clinical\" centres offering services  in  colonic\r\n\r\nirrigation, live cell therapy, hair transplants and other  forms\r\n\r\nof transformative cosmetic surgery.  We have had cases of people\r\n\r\ndying  because  of botched up colonic irrigation or  scarred  by\r\n\r\nplastic  surgery performed by inadequately trained  beauticians.\r\n\r\nHence,  we have to be wary of these medical practices which  are\r\n\r\nof questionable medical benefits.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is therefore timely, some may even argue that it\r\n\r\nis  long overdue.  It is an enabling instrument which will  give\r\n\r\nthe  authorities  the legal teeth to classify and  regulate  all\r\n\r\nhealthcare   practices   and  to  vigorously   intervene,   when\r\n\r\nnecessary,  to safeguard the integrity of the medical profession\r\n\r\nand  protect  the public.  But, Sir, I do have  some  qualms  on\r\n\r\ncertain  elements in the Bill which, if not corrected,  may  not\r\n\r\nprovide  sufficient guidelines and checks on the authorities  in\r\n\r\nthe pursuit of their duty.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to clarify four points. My first\r\n\r\nquery is on the notion of \"healthcare establishment\".  The\r\n\r\nadvocates of alternative and complementary medicine will regard\r\n\r\ntheir healing modality as more holistic and less invasive than\r\n\r\n\"western\" institutional medical practices.  Are these healing\r\n\r\n\"clinics\" in meditation, aromatherapy, acupuncture, foot\r\n\r\nreflexology and other holistic and wellness centres classified\r\n\r\nas \"healthcare establishments\"?  Not only had these new\r\n\r\napproaches gained popularity among entrepreneurs who wished to\r\n\r\ndevelop them within medical institutions in the new millennium,\r\n\r\nusers in the community have argued in favour of their\r\n\r\n\"treatment\" potency.  A massage, for example, is regarded as\r\n\r\nhaving more healing power than the panadol.  This marks a shift\r\n\r\nof medical preference in some pockets of Singaporeans away from\r\n\r\nwestern clinical methods of healing.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Minister to articulate at this juncture,\r\n\r\nother than the institutions earlier named by her, what would she\r\n\r\ndefine  as \"healthcare establishment\".  In line with my  concern\r\n\r\nwith  the  non-traditional  medical institutions,  are  slimming\r\n\r\ncentres,  beauty parlours and hair transplant salons  classified\r\n\r\nas  \"health establishments\"?  Do the practitioners like  Chinese\r\n\r\nsinsehs  and  counsellors with non-credentialised qualifications\r\n\r\nin  the new healing trades come under the scrutiny of this Bill?\r\n\r\nIf  they are not, I urge the Minister to consider broadening the\r\n\r\nscope  of  the Bill that enables the Ministry to regulate  their\r\n\r\ngrowth, classify the plethora of healthcare practices, supervise\r\n\r\nand sanction their service and professional standards.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second concern is on the notion of \"prescribed\r\n\r\nstandards\"  in  relation to the issue  or  refusal  to  issue  a\r\n\r\nlicence  by the Director.  Alternative health healing  practices\r\n\r\nare  now  carried out by individuals who are paid to  make  home\r\n\r\nvisits to attend to the sickly, often without assistance of  any\r\n\r\nnursing staff.  Some are trained healers, having studied abroad,\r\n\r\nwhere  alternative  medicine has become institutionalised,  many\r\n\r\nothers are not accredited by any training body but have\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ngained  their  healing  experience  through  work.   These  same\r\n\r\npractitioners  are  invited sometimes  by  private  clinics  and\r\n\r\nhospitals  to  conduct  limited  healing  programmes   for   the\r\n\r\npatients.   If  any mishap happens during the  treatment  and  a\r\n\r\npatient  suffers  or  dies, is the institution  employing  these\r\n\r\nholistic practitioners held responsible for the problem?   Where\r\n\r\ndo  these freelance practitioners stand in relation to the Bill?\r\n\r\nI  urge  the  Minister  to  develop  some  broad  guidelines  of\r\n\r\n\"prescribed    standards\"   in   each   field   of    \"western\",\r\n\r\n\"traditional\",  alternative or complementary medicine  to  guide\r\n\r\nentrepreneurship   in  this area.  I  can  understand  that  the\r\n\r\nMinister   may   not  want  to  come  down  \"heavy\"   on   these\r\n\r\npractitioners  by  killing the industry with  a  narrow  set  of\r\n\r\n\"do's\"  and \"don'ts\", but neither do we want to leave the matter\r\n\r\nso  open  that  will  lead  to  explosive  contention  upon  the\r\n\r\ndisagreement of definitions and standards between policy  makers\r\n\r\nand practitioners.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to my third question on safeguards for\r\n\r\npractitioners.   In  the  event that the  Director  revokes  the\r\n\r\nlicence  of a medical establishment, what recourse is there  for\r\n\r\nthe  licensee  to  have  his  case heard  independently  without\r\n\r\nprejudice?   The  Bill provides for appeal to  be  made  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister  who will then set up an Advisory Committee  to  review\r\n\r\nthe petition.  Would the Minister consider setting up a recourse\r\n\r\nmechanism   and   procedures  that  allow  an  independent   and\r\n\r\nprofessional judgement of alleged offences?  In relation to this\r\n\r\nmatter,   does  the  Medical  Council  have  a  regulatory   and\r\n\r\ndisciplinary function in adjudicating the judgement process?\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My fourth and last concern questions the total protection\r\n\r\nfrom any suit or other legal proceedings which the Director, any\r\n\r\nauthorised  officer  or  any member  of  an  Advisory  Committee\r\n\r\nenjoys.   What is the rationale, Sir, for this protection?   And\r\n\r\nhow can we make sure that they will execute their duties in good\r\n\r\nfaith,  consistently and by maintaining a high  level  of  sound\r\n\r\njudgment   if  they  were  not  held  responsible  for  wrongful\r\n\r\ndecisions or malicious decisions?  If directors in any  business\r\n\r\ncorporations come under the scrutiny of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe laws, why not the Director in executing this\r\n\r\nBill?  Is it appropriate or necessary to endow so much power in\r\n\r\none Director since the Attorney-General's Chambers are already\r\n\r\nentrusted with the jurisdiction to try any offence related to\r\n\r\nhealth malpractices?  Could the Minister elaborate on some of\r\n\r\nthe qualified privileges which the Director has to abide by\r\n\r\nbefore he proceeds to search and seize documents from private\r\n\r\npractices?  I hope that the Minister would clarify these points\r\n\r\nin her response.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will attempt to answer\r\n\r\nthe  points  raised  by  Dr Lily Neo  first.   In  general,  she\r\n\r\nsupports the Bill but she has raised a couple of issues.  First,\r\n\r\nthe  issue  of quality versus quantity.  She asked  whether  the\r\n\r\nmain objective of the Bill is to regulate quality, that is,  the\r\n\r\nstandard  of the professional services or control the  quantity,\r\n\r\nthat  is, the number of healthcare establishments that  will  be\r\n\r\nset up.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that the main objective of the Bill is to\r\n\r\ngive  my Ministry more effective means to ensure that hospitals,\r\n\r\nclinics  and nursing homes maintain a good quality of  care  and\r\n\r\nthat  there are provisions within the establishments for the  QA\r\n\r\nactivities.    So  the  Act  primarily  seeks  to  enforce   the\r\n\r\nparameters  that the hospitals, nursing homes and  clinics  must\r\n\r\nwork under in order that the health services given to the public\r\n\r\nare  of  a  high  standard.  The new section 5(3)  of  the  Bill\r\n\r\ndefines  the parameters for the Director to issue or  refuse  to\r\n\r\nissue  a  licence  but  none of these parameters  refer  to  the\r\n\r\ndistribution  or  the number of hospitals,  clinics  or  nursing\r\n\r\nhomes.  In other words, the Bill does not control the number  or\r\n\r\ndistribution of such premises.  She was correct in pointing  out\r\n\r\nthat  one sometimes finds in HDB estates a concentration of five\r\n\r\nor six medical clinics.  But this is the result of the tendering\r\n\r\nprocess  where  the  doctors make a  decision  to  locate  their\r\n\r\nclinics in a certain locality.  We have, in the past, left it to\r\n\r\nmarket  forces and I think we should still leave  it  to  market\r\n\r\nforces  to  decide on the number and distribution of  healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishments.  The Bill is not intended at all to  cover  this\r\n\r\naspect of her concern.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would discuss her point about whether traditional\r\n\r\nChinese medicine or acupuncture clinics can be considered as\r\n\r\nhealthcare establishments under this Bill, and other kinds of\r\n\r\nhealthcare establishments that we might want to regulate, later\r\n\r\non.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was concerned also about new sub-section 10(4) which\r\n\r\nstates  that \"the minutes of meetings can be made available  for\r\n\r\nany  proceedings\" and whether it would erode the  protection  of\r\n\r\nthe said members in any proceedings.  Under sub-section 10(3) of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill,  a  person who is a member of a QA committee  is  not\r\n\r\ncompelled   to  disclose  the  proceedings  of  the   committee.\r\n\r\nHowever, sub-section 10(4) would only apply if the Ministry  has\r\n\r\nadequate  reason to believe that this person has  not  acted  in\r\n\r\ngood  faith and there is some deliberate cover-up of wrongdoings\r\n\r\nby  the  doctor  under  investigation.  The  Director  can  then\r\n\r\nrequire that the relevant information or minutes of meetings  be\r\n\r\nmade  available for review.  This is the same question that  Mdm\r\n\r\nClaire  Chiang  has asked about qualified privilege.   In  other\r\n\r\nwords, a member of a QC committee is protected by this Bill  and\r\n\r\nis  not  compelled to divulge any proceedings, but if  there  is\r\n\r\nreason for the Ministry to suspect that there is some wrongdoing\r\n\r\nor  that the QC member did not act in good faith, the minutes of\r\n\r\nevidence could still be called for.  The Ministry can still look\r\n\r\ninto  this  evidence and an aggrieved patient  or  doctor  would\r\n\r\nstill  have  recourse to the normal process of the law  to  sue,\r\n\r\nbecause  if  the QC member was found not to have acted  in  good\r\n\r\nfaith,  then  what he said and his opinions in the QC  committee\r\n\r\nwould still be open to legal judgment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the high fees that Dr Lily Neo talked about, I would\r\n\r\nlike to clarify that the $600 clinic licence fee is actually for\r\n\r\ntwo years.  It is not for one year.  Also, this licence allows a\r\n\r\nclinic  to have up to five doctors or dentists.  The onus  on  a\r\n\r\nsingle  or  individual doctor or dentist is not  that  heavy  in\r\n\r\nterms  of financial burden.  I take her point that doctors  have\r\n\r\nto pay for their\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\npractising certificate, clinic licence fee and also some charges\r\n\r\nor  fees for equipment such as ultrasound, laser, x-rays and  so\r\n\r\non.   These are meant to cover only administrative expenses  for\r\n\r\nenforcing  the  regulations under the various  requirements.   I\r\n\r\nhave   actually  thought  about  this  and  I  asked  for   some\r\n\r\ncomparative figures on what lawyers have to pay to stay  in  the\r\n\r\npractice.   They  pay  much  more,  in  fact.   For  example,  a\r\n\r\npractising  certificate for lawyers can vary  between  $450  and\r\n\r\n$750  per  year.  All of them have also to pay for an  indemnity\r\n\r\npolicy, on an average of $4,000 for every million dollar revenue\r\n\r\ncollected, as compared to the doctor's medical defence insurance\r\n\r\nwhich  is just between $1,000 and $2,000.  But this is  for  the\r\n\r\ngood  of lawyers and doctors.  They should cover themselves with\r\n\r\nsuch  funds.   On top of that, if lawyers want to  be  a  notary\r\n\r\npublic  or  a  Commissioner  of  Oaths,  they  have  to  pay  an\r\n\r\nadditional  registration  fee of  $1,000.   I  should  say  that\r\n\r\nlawyers are comparable to doctors as professionals, but the fees\r\n\r\nthey  pay  are  higher than what doctors are  paying  under  our\r\n\r\npresent schedule.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take her point that these fees should not be too onerous\r\n\r\nand  her  point that the requirement for licensees of healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishments   to  furnish  information  on  their   practice,\r\n\r\nprocedures, and so on, should not be too onerous.  I would  like\r\n\r\nto  assure  her  that  the visits would be  coordinated  by  the\r\n\r\nvarious sections of the Ministry and my officers would make sure\r\n\r\nthat  the data collection and submission will not place an undue\r\n\r\ndemand  on  healthcare establishments at the  expense  of  their\r\n\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, she asked that the term \"healthcare establishment\"\r\n\r\nshould be put in the preamble of the Act.  I can look into that.\r\n\r\nI  think  there  is  no  problem  with  putting  back  the  term\r\n\r\n\"healthcare establishment\" into the preamble of the Act.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mdm Claire Chiang's concerns, I find her reference to\r\n\r\nthe  Director  of  Medical Services as being comparable  to  the\r\n\r\ndirector  of a company rather puzzling.  I think we are  talking\r\n\r\nabout two different things.  The Director of Medical Services is\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncharged with the responsibility to oversee the\r\n\r\nprofessional standards of the entire health sector.  I find that\r\n\r\nit is not really a comparable issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as appeals are concerned and on safeguards, if the\r\n\r\nlicensee  commits a certain breach of the licensing requirement,\r\n\r\nthis  would  be under the purview of our Ministry's regulations.\r\n\r\nThe  Act  already provides for the composition of fines, instead\r\n\r\nof bringing the licensee to court.  If it is a matter of medical\r\n\r\nethics or a professional lapse, then the person would be brought\r\n\r\nbefore  the  Medical Council.  So it is a matter of professional\r\n\r\njudgment  and the Council is an independent body.  I can  assure\r\n\r\nher  that various bodies are in place to regulate the healthcare\r\n\r\nestablishments  and  to  ensure that  they  perform  to  certain\r\n\r\nstandards  within  the  purview of this appeal  process.   If  a\r\n\r\nlicensee  is  aggrieved, he can appeal to the Minister  and  the\r\n\r\nMinister  can  appoint  an  Advisory Committee.   This  Advisory\r\n\r\nCommittee would be a panel of experts, depending on the type  of\r\n\r\nhealthcare  establishments you are talking about.  Obviously,  a\r\n\r\ndental  clinic  would be under a panel of dentists.   A  medical\r\n\r\nclinic would be referred to a panel of medical professionals who\r\n\r\nare  in  that specialty.  We are talking about having panels  of\r\n\r\nexperts  to  assist the Minister in Advisory  Committees.   This\r\n\r\nappeal process is in place.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should they be protected in the same way for their\r\n\r\nopinions?  As I explained, both the QA committee and members  of\r\n\r\nthe  Advisory  Committees  are to give  their  opinions  to  the\r\n\r\nhospitals,  the healthcare establishments or to the Minister  in\r\n\r\ngood faith.  They can express their opinion very frankly in such\r\n\r\ncommittees and they give their opinion in good faith.  But  they\r\n\r\nare  only given qualified privilege.  If there is any reason  to\r\n\r\ndoubt that they are trying to cover up any mistakes done by  the\r\n\r\nhospital  or  to  protect another colleague,  then  there  is  a\r\n\r\nprocess whereby their evidence could still be discovered.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for alternative medicine, I share her concern that there\r\n\r\nis a proliferation of\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nso-called alternative medicine, complementary\r\n\r\nmedicine or alternative healthcare practices springing up in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is a world-wide trend and I think many\r\n\r\ncountries in the world are still grappling with how to regulate\r\n\r\nand recognise them.  I would not want to give my opinion on\r\n\r\nwhether these alternative practices are more holistic than\r\n\r\nwestern medicine.  I would not want to give an opinion on\r\n\r\nwhether they are holistic or not.  But definitely, they exist.\r\n\r\nSome have long traditions, like traditional Chinese medicine.\r\n\r\nSome have sprung up recently, like the revival of customary\r\n\r\nhealing practices and so on.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, traditional medicine, whether it is of the\r\n\r\nChinese, Malay or Indian tradition, is exempted from the Private\r\n\r\nHospitals  and  Medical Clinics Act, just as these practitioners\r\n\r\nare  exempted from the Medical Registration Act.  But as I  have\r\n\r\ninformed  the  House  in the Budget debate  last  year,  we  are\r\n\r\nalready  going  into the area of registering acupuncture  within\r\n\r\nthe  near  future.  With the registration of acupuncturists,  we\r\n\r\nwould  go into the registration of acupuncture clinics and  then\r\n\r\nmaybe  we  would  move on to other areas of traditional  Chinese\r\n\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for other kinds of complementary medicine, I think we\r\n\r\nhave  to  tread  with great care.  We have to be very  cautious.\r\n\r\nThe  boundaries are vague and the claims are also very difficult\r\n\r\nfor  us  to  evaluate.  We have to tread very slowly.   But  the\r\n\r\nAmendment  Bill  will precisely enable us to go into  regulating\r\n\r\nthem,  if  there is a need.  At the moment, health  or  wellness\r\n\r\ncentres  and health spas do not carry out the kind of diagnosis,\r\n\r\ntreatment   and   care  of  people  with  disease,   injury   or\r\n\r\ndisabilities  in  the same way as medical practitioners  do.  So\r\n\r\nthey are not under the purview of this Act.  I think we have  to\r\n\r\nbe very careful about going into the area of regulating slimming\r\n\r\ncentres,  beauty  salons and so on.  We have already  gone  into\r\n\r\nregulation of cosmetics.  The Amendment Bill will allow  us  the\r\n\r\nflexibility  of  regulating  these  other  kinds  of   so-called\r\n\r\nhealthcare establishments, if there is a need to.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her point about colonic irrigation clinics, the case we\r\n\r\nknow was an unlicensed clinic, and it is precisely because of\r\n\r\nthis incident that we need to enhance our powers to go and\r\n\r\nsearch premises, and seize evidence because we had difficulty in\r\n\r\ngetting evidence to prosecute this case.

My colleagues, the Malay Members of Parliament,\r\n\r\nand  I received much feedback from the public last year and also\r\n\r\nthis year.  Members of the public have also written or discussed\r\n\r\nthe  Bill  with my Ministry and MUIS.  The Select  Committee  on\r\n\r\nthis Bill received a total of 31 written representations from  a\r\n\r\nwide  variety of individuals and organisations.  I  am  grateful\r\n\r\nthat so many have taken time to give their views and suggestions\r\n\r\non the Bill and I thank them all for their contributions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Select Committee considered all the\r\n\r\nrepresentations  submitted.  It heard oral evidence  from  seven\r\n\r\nrepresentors.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nTo  reflect  the  diverse views, the Committee also  decided  to\r\n\r\npublish  four  other  written  representations  in  its   Report\r\n\r\nsubmitted to Parliament.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recommends a number of amendments to the Bill\r\n\r\nafter studying the written submissions and the oral evidence  of\r\n\r\nthe  representors.  The Committee also considered all the  views\r\n\r\nthat  Members of Parliament expressed during the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nSecond  Reading of the Bill.  The Report of the Select Committee\r\n\r\nhas been circulated to Members of the House last month.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the Select Committee's\r\n\r\ndeliberations and recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Allowing the Civil Courts to Hear Ancillary Matters on Divorce</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, read with section 17A of the Supreme Court of\r\n\r\nJudicature  Act  (SCJA),  section  35A  of  the  amendment  that\r\n\r\nprovided  for  the  Civil Courts to hear  matters  ancillary  to\r\n\r\nMuslim divorces, namely, custody and division or disposition  of\r\n\r\nmatrimonial  property  on divorce, drew the  most  interest  and\r\n\r\ncomment   from  the  Muslim  community.   Eighteen  representors\r\n\r\nexpressed  concern over or were against the amendment  and  four\r\n\r\nsupported  it.   The  main issues raised by  these  representors\r\n\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that the amendment would dilute the status and powers\r\n\r\nof the Syariah Court;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that the Civil Law applied by the Civil Courts may\r\n\r\ncontradict Syariah law; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) that more Muslims would turn to the Civil Courts to\r\n\r\nresolve  their matters when they should be going to the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt instead.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, allow me to present the Committee's deliberations on\r\n\r\nthese  concerns.  On the first point, the Committee  notes  that\r\n\r\nthe Bill does not -  and I repeat  -  does not dilute nor remove\r\n\r\nthe  powers  of the Syariah Court.  The amendment is  really  to\r\n\r\nclarify the jurisdiction between\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe Civil Courts and the Syariah Court on ancillary issues.   In\r\n\r\nthe  Second  Reading of the Bill, I emphasised that the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  continued to have jurisdiction over all matters presently\r\n\r\nwithin  its jurisdiction where the parties are Muslims  or  were\r\n\r\nmarried  according to Muslim law.  In fact, under new provisions\r\n\r\nin the Bill, parties would now be required to obtain the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt's   leave  or  to  be  counselled  before  commencing   or\r\n\r\ncontinuing proceedings in the Civil Courts on issues relating to\r\n\r\nproperty  on divorce or custody of children.  The provisions  in\r\n\r\nAMLA  make  it explicit and transparent the system for  applying\r\n\r\nfor  leave  to  commence or continue civil proceedings  and  the\r\n\r\nstaying of these proceedings.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second point, the Committee finds little cause for\r\n\r\nconcern over possible conflict between Civil and Syariah laws if\r\n\r\nancillary  matters  were  heard  in  the  Civil  Courts.    Some\r\n\r\nrepresentors, for example, were particularly concerned over  how\r\n\r\nCivil  law  would  apply to disputes on the  custody  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nchildren.   The   Committee  consulted  the   Attorney-General's\r\n\r\nChambers,  Muslim lawyers who practise in both civil courts  and\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court and MUIS and found that there are no  differences\r\n\r\nin  basic principles between Syariah law and the Guardianship of\r\n\r\nInfants Act, as both consider the welfare of the child to be  of\r\n\r\nparamount  importance.  The AMLA, in addition, also specifically\r\n\r\nprovides  for the Civil Courts, in cases where religious  issues\r\n\r\ncould  be  a  consideration, to seek advice from the  Legal  (or\r\n\r\nFatwa) Committee of MUIS.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, several representors strongly pushed for the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  to be the only forum to hear matrimonial disputes between\r\n\r\nMuslims, fearing that giving an avenue to the Civil Courts would\r\n\r\nundermine and diminish the authority of the Syariah Court.  They\r\n\r\nfelt  that in the past, Muslims had little choice but to  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Courts, as the Syariah Court did not  have  adequate\r\n\r\nresources  to  deal with their disputes.  The  Select  Committee\r\n\r\ndeliberated  over these concerns at length.  It  concluded  that\r\n\r\nMuslims,  as citizens of this country, must be allowed the  same\r\n\r\nright of access to the Civil Courts as non-Muslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may also be instances where the legal issues in a\r\n\r\ncase  need  to or can only be resolved in the Civil Court.   For\r\n\r\ninstance,  in  disputes  over property, the  legal  claim  could\r\n\r\ninvolve third parties who are non-Muslims.  Another example will\r\n\r\nbe  cases  involving  property  or  parties  overseas.   Let  me\r\n\r\nreiterate  that  the  Bill does not in  any  way  undermine  the\r\n\r\nauthority of the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee saw the need for sufficient safeguards\r\n\r\nto  ensure that parties intending to resolve ancillary issues in\r\n\r\nthe Civil Court did so with full knowledge and understanding  of\r\n\r\nthe implications.  Under the Bill, the legal processes give that\r\n\r\nperson  ample  opportunity for such knowledge and understanding.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  he or she must first seek leave of the Syariah  Court.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he or she may appeal to the Appeal Board in MUIS for a\r\n\r\nfinal decision, if dissatisfied with the Syariah Court's ruling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Committee found that there is no such safeguard for\r\n\r\ncouples  who, by  mutual consent, want to go to the Civil  Court\r\n\r\nto settle their matrimonial disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some representors held that the Bill should provide a\r\n\r\nsafeguard in the form of counselling for this group.  They  will\r\n\r\nat  least  be making an informed decision should they insist  on\r\n\r\ngoing  to  the  Civil  Courts  despite  being  counselled.   The\r\n\r\nCommittee agrees and recommends amending the Bill to provide for\r\n\r\nmandatory counselling to such couples.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some members of the community expressed concern that\r\n\r\nthe  legal process which I have described may generate more work\r\n\r\nfor  the Syariah Court and distract it from performing its  core\r\n\r\nfunctions.   This  is unlikely to be the case, because  a  clear\r\n\r\njurisprudence on the conditions for granting leave will  develop\r\n\r\nafter  the  initial set of cases going before the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nand  the  Appeal  Board.   Over  time,  there  should  be  fewer\r\n\r\napplications as the Syariah Court grows in stature and  improves\r\n\r\nits efficiency.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Strengthening the Syariah Court</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now turn to the measures to make the Syariah Court\r\n\r\nstronger.  The Select\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nCommittee received several useful suggestions on ways to improve\r\n\r\nthe Syariah Court.  The Committee considered all the suggestions\r\n\r\nreceived and recommended the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To appoint a Senior President amongst the Presidents\r\n\r\nin  the  Syariah  Court to head and provide directions  for  the\r\n\r\nCourt   and  to  issue  practice  directions,  lay  down   court\r\n\r\nprocedures and review rules and regulations;\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To appoint a panel of ad hoc Presidents of the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court to help cut down the present backlog of cases; and\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) To appoint a Registrar to help relieve the\r\n\r\nPresidents of their non-substantive legal work.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these, the Syariah Court will be able to dispense\r\n\r\njustice  to the community effectively and speedily.  My Ministry\r\n\r\nwill  also  be  looking  separately at administrative  measures,\r\n\r\nprocedures and manpower needs to enhance the efficiency  of  the\r\n\r\nCourt to dovetail  the Committee's recommendations.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Incorporating the Women's Charter Principles for Disposition or Division of Matrimonial Property on Divorce</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides that the Syariah Court shall apply\r\n\r\nprinciples in section 112 of the Women's Charter relating to the\r\n\r\ndisposition  or  division  of matrimonial  property  on  divorce\r\n\r\nprovided  that  they are consistent with Syariah  law.   Several\r\n\r\nrepresentors felt that the Syariah Court should not be bound  by\r\n\r\nthe  Women's Charter despite the qualification or to  explicitly\r\n\r\nmention   in   AMLA  of  the  application  of  Women's   Charter\r\n\r\nprinciples, as they may suggest  that the Syariah law lacks such\r\n\r\nprinciples.  To correct any misperception, the Select  Committee\r\n\r\nrecommends incorporating into AMLA those principles from section\r\n\r\n112  that are consistent with Syariah law, but without reference\r\n\r\nto the Women's Charter itself.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Matters Pertaining to MUIS</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now deal with matters pertaining to the Majlis\r\n\r\nUgama Islam Singapura (MUIS).\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Wakafs</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of wakafs, a representor suggested putting the\r\n\r\nonus  to register wakafs on the trustees.  Wakafs are properties\r\n\r\nthat  Muslims have dedicated under Syariah law.  All wakafs,  by\r\n\r\nlaw,  are vested in MUIS.  It follows, therefore, that they must\r\n\r\nbe  registered with MUIS.  However, it is impossible for MUIS to\r\n\r\nknow  which  properties  have been  so  dedicated  unless  their\r\n\r\ntrustees  dutifully inform MUIS about them.  In the  past,  MUIS\r\n\r\nhas   had  to  initiate  court  proceedings   to  recover  wakaf\r\n\r\nproperties disposed of by their trustees.  The Select  Committee\r\n\r\nagrees  with the suggestion and recommends an amendment to  make\r\n\r\nregistration  of  wakafs mandatory to safeguard  the  properties\r\n\r\nfrom  being disposed of indiscriminately.  The registration will\r\n\r\nhelp  prevent  costly litigation and will protect  the  innocent\r\n\r\nbuyer  of a wakaf property.  It will also enable MUIS to develop\r\n\r\nand enhance the value of the wakaf properties for the benefit of\r\n\r\nthe  community.   MUIS will ensure that all trustees  of  wakafs\r\n\r\nhave  ample  notice before registration is made  mandatory.   It\r\n\r\nwill  launch a public awareness drive to inform Muslims  of  the\r\n\r\nrequirement.  The trustees of existing wakafs will be given  six\r\n\r\nmonths from the operation of the law to register. Trustees  also\r\n\r\nhave six months to register new wakaf properties.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>Haj services</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also agrees with a suggestion that persons\r\n\r\nacting  as  guides  for pilgrims should be  qualified  religious\r\n\r\nteachers  so  that the pilgrims who go to the haj  are  properly\r\n\r\nadvised on the performance of haj rites.  This will be taken  up\r\n\r\nin the Rules.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I would like to reiterate that the\r\n\r\namendments  to  the  Bill  seek to resolve  the  ambiguity  that\r\n\r\nexisted until now between the jurisdiction of the\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  and Civil Courts and to strengthen  the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt.   They do not diminish the status nor do they  take  away\r\n\r\nany jurisdiction of the Syariah Court.  Muslims will continue to\r\n\r\nhave  access  to  the Civil Courts to settle  their  matrimonial\r\n\r\ndisputes albeit with prior approval by the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the law alone cannot move the institution forward.\r\n\r\nThe  Syariah Court will need the understanding, support and help\r\n\r\nof  counsellors, lawyers, religious officials, community leaders\r\n\r\nand  others,  to enable it to become a court of choice  for  all\r\n\r\nMuslims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>EXEMPTED BUSINESS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Motion)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the item of business under\r\n\r\ndiscussion be exempted at this day's sitting from the provisions\r\n\r\nof Standing Order No. 1.  -  [Mr Wong Kan Seng].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ADMINISTRATION OF MUSLIM LAW</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik\r\n\r\nSidek  bin Saniff) (In Malay): Mr Speaker, Sir, the decision  to\r\n\r\nbring  the  AMLA amendment to a Select Committee is  a  decision\r\n\r\nthat is correct and of great importance.  It is obvious that the\r\n\r\ndecision has given rise to three positive effects.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It gives society plenty of time and chance to analyse in\r\n\r\ndetail,  especially  on the controversial  aspect  such  as  the\r\n\r\nconcurrent  jurisdiction  and  at  the  same  time  giving   the\r\n\r\nGovernment a chance to explain any doubts or misconceptions that\r\n\r\nmight  exist, to gain consensus in many areas and to  develop  a\r\n\r\ndeeper understanding towards other issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its acceptance or approval in Parliament today gives rise\r\n\r\nto two significance:\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) This amendment is more comprehensive and thus\r\n\r\nstrengthens the powers of MUIS and the Syariah Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Concurrent jurisdiction, God willing, will give rise to\r\n\r\na  feeling of responsibility and care in handling this sensitive\r\n\r\nissue.  We  hope that the appointment of a Senior  President  of\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court,  an  ad hoc President and a Registrar,  together\r\n\r\nwith  its  powers, will make the society understand even  deeper\r\n\r\nand  thus  accept this amendment and the issues associated  with\r\n\r\nit.   In fact, the cooperation between the Syariah Court and the\r\n\r\ncivil  court  from today will make way for a new  journey  which\r\n\r\nwill  not  only affect the Malay-Muslim community but  also  the\r\n\r\nsociety as a whole.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will make a unique journey or pathway. This\r\n\r\nuniqueness is obvious because the decision involves two  courts,\r\n\r\nie,  the  Syariah and the civil courts which are  based  on  two\r\n\r\ndifferent  backgrounds, one being religion and the  other  being\r\n\r\nsecular.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are fortunate that our secular system is not against\r\n\r\nreligion,  unlike in some socialist and communist  states  which\r\n\r\nregard  religion  as  opium or drug that is detrimental  to  the\r\n\r\nstate  and  its  social system.  In fact,  our  country  is  too\r\n\r\nsensitive  with  the concept of multi-racialism, multi-religions\r\n\r\nand  multi-lingualism,  that it has  taken  action  to  protect,\r\n\r\npreserve and safeguard these three aspects. The concept of multi-lingualism  is embodied in the Maintenance of Religious  Harmony\r\n\r\nAct  and  the Inter-Religious Council, are some of the  positive\r\n\r\nmeasures that were taken.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are made possible because in a secularised\r\n\r\nsystem where there is no concept of after-life, there are  still\r\n\r\nthree sensitive factors that it stands by: Principles, Fact  and\r\n\r\nMoral.  Even  though  there are no \"spiritual  qualities\"  in  a\r\n\r\nsecular  system,  this system ensures that its moral  aspect  is\r\n\r\napplied.  Sometimes differentiating between the  wrong  and  the\r\n\r\nright  goes  in  line with the spiritual demands,  just  as  the\r\n\r\nimportance  of  cleanliness, anti-corruption, misuse  of  power,\r\n\r\ntheft, murder, abasement and the like.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also times when these go against the customs,\r\n\r\nculture and religion, when culture, some say religion, does  not\r\n\r\nallow  the  burning  of firecrackers, which would  endanger  our\r\n\r\nproperty and lives; especially so in the recent legalisation  of\r\n\r\nfootball  betting, to save society from fraud, the use of  force\r\n\r\nand   victimisation.   Secularism  at  this  juncture   has   to\r\n\r\ndifferentiate between the evil and the lesser evil.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the cooperation between the Syariah Court and\r\n\r\nthe  civil  court  would open a new phase that is  positive  and\r\n\r\nunique,  when  the  two  parties  will  respect  each  other   - especially in Moral and Faith.  As long as morality does not  go\r\n\r\nagainst   faith,  I  am  sure  that  the  journey  or  path   of\r\n\r\ncooperation, however long it may be, will be a learning  process\r\n\r\nthat  will bring benefit of mutuality in a multi-racial country.\r\n\r\nLet  us say that a wrong decision has been made, correction must\r\n\r\nbe  made  immediately, this could separate  the  wise  from  the\r\n\r\nfoolish.    Whichever  is  right  hopefully  could  be  refined,\r\n\r\nespecially  on  the  issue of child custody,  joint  income  and\r\n\r\ndivorce claims.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a heavy responsibility that we all must take. It\r\n\r\nis  a  vista that should be explored with care. Being  cautious,\r\n\r\nmutual  respect  and tolerance itself have  been  shown  by  the\r\n\r\nProphet  Muhammad 14th Century ago till the birth of the Medinah\r\n\r\nDeclaration in the 6th Century.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim thinkers have made a conclusion that making this\r\n\r\nfirst  Human Rights Declaration shows the universality of Islam.\r\n\r\nIt  involved  the  Muslims, Christians and  Jews.   Even  though\r\n\r\nMedinah  is  under the rule of Islam, the declaration  does  not\r\n\r\nstress  on  Darus Islam (Land of Islam) but more  on  Darussalam\r\n\r\n(Land  of  Peace).  I have asked Megawati who recently  came  to\r\n\r\nSingapore.   I asked her when her father introduced the  concept\r\n\r\nof  pancasila, who among the Imams introduced this concept.  She\r\n\r\ncould  not  answer.  She said perhaps pancasila existed  before.\r\n\r\nShe  said  that  the concept of Darussalam (Land of  Peace)  and\r\n\r\nDarus Islam (Land of Islam) may not be understood by\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmany.   Even among the Muslims themselves, they are still  vague\r\n\r\nabout the concept.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept that was encompassed in the Medinah Declaration\r\n\r\nexisted  hundreds of years before the birth of the Magna  Carta,\r\n\r\nwhich  existed in the year 1215. This spirit, I believe,  caused\r\n\r\nthe  bishop Nestoria to write to his friend and this  letter  is\r\n\r\nstill being kept safely:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(In English)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'These Tayites (Arabs/Muslim) to whom God has accorded\r\n\r\ndomination in our days, have also become our master; yet they do\r\n\r\nnot  combat at all the Christian religion. On the contrary, they\r\n\r\neven  protect our faith, respect our priests and saints and make\r\n\r\ndonations  to our churches and our convents.  They all inherited\r\n\r\nthis and enjoyed freedom of conscience, justice and prosperity.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(In Malay)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These factors too must have inspired Dutch orientalist\r\n\r\nProf.  Wensinck,  a  professor  in  Arab  language,  before  the\r\n\r\noutbreak  of the Second World War, made efforts to decipher  the\r\n\r\nsayings of the Prophet Muhammad (hadith) and he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>(In English)\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'.the idea of a concordance of the principal collections of\r\n\r\nhadith  should  be prepared with a view to facilitate  reference\r\n\r\nwork  among  the  western  scholars  who  were  working  on  the\r\n\r\ndifferent aspects of Islam.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wensinck died before World War II and his works were\r\n\r\ncontinued by Prof. Mensing.  The book entitled \"Concordance  and\r\n\r\nIndices  of  Islamic Tradition\" shows to the hadith recorded  by\r\n\r\nBukhari,  Muslim,  Tirmidzi,  Ibnu Majah,  An-Nasai,  Abu  Daud,\r\n\r\nMusnad  Ad-Darami,  Muwatta' Imam Malik  and  Musnad  Ahmad  ibn\r\n\r\nHambal.  This  book became one of the references  for  graduates\r\n\r\npursuing their PhD.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br>4.10 pm\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of tolerance should be our inspiration when we\r\n\r\nenter the next millennium, the millennium of biotechnology.  For\r\n\r\ninstance,  our  cell,  nucleus, chromosome,  DNA  and  the  ATGC\r\n\r\n(adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine).  The AMLA debate gives us\r\n\r\nthe chance to strengthen the fabric of our society. Any\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nmulti-racial,  multi-religious  and  multi-lingual  state   that\r\n\r\nignores this fact will face paralysis, in fact, destruction.  In\r\n\r\n1991,  Sahid Sahoman criticised the Prime Minister by using  the\r\n\r\nword \"religion\".  The opposition said that he should not be  the\r\n\r\nleader  of Muslims and Malays, because he is not a Muslim.   How\r\n\r\nreligion has been misused!\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, the following day, we had a press\r\n\r\nconference and the Prime Minister, when explaining to the press,\r\n\r\nhe  looked  at me and I looked at him.  Maybe it is  because  we\r\n\r\nhave  been together for so long.  I think he knew that I  wanted\r\n\r\nto  say something.  Usually, I would just listen and keep quiet.\r\n\r\nSo  he  gave me the opportunity to speak.  I said that what  the\r\n\r\nopposition  had done was wrong, because Islam is not so  narrow.\r\n\r\nIslam  divides  non-Muslims  into  three  categories.   Firstly,\r\n\r\nharabi  non-Muslims.   No one has to be a Muslim  to  fight  the\r\n\r\noppressor.  Secondly,  dzimmi non-Muslims, the good  ones.   Our\r\n\r\nProphet  treated  them well.  Even the Muslims were  envious  by\r\n\r\nthis  treatment.  The Prime Minister can perhaps belong to  that\r\n\r\ncategory, or at least an ahdi non-Muslim that can become partner\r\n\r\nin,  say,  business.  It is better if you trust  the  ahdi  non-Muslims,  rather  than  do business with Muslims  who  might  be\r\n\r\ncorrupt.    So,   the  next  day,  gentlemanly,  Sahid   Sahoman\r\n\r\napologised to our Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gus Dur or A Rahman Wahid, in a television interview, has\r\n\r\nexpressed his dislike to what had been happening in his country,\r\n\r\nIndonesia.  He hoped that an atmosphere of tolerance and  mutual\r\n\r\nrespect  will  come  into its re-existence.  He  has  said  that\r\n\r\nbefore, all pastors, priests and imams used to engage in healthy\r\n\r\nbanter or humour even if they are from different religions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that there are three religious leaders, Christian,\r\n\r\nHindu  and  Muslim leaders.  While they joked, they asked  which\r\n\r\none  among  them  are the closest to God.  The Christian  priest\r\n\r\nsaid that it is Christianity \"because we call God our Father.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hindu priest also claimed that they are also\r\n\r\nnot far from God because they use Om. According to my Hindu\r\n\r\nfriend, Lingam:\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(In English)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Om is a spiritual sound to the Hindus. It prevails in the\r\n\r\nheart  of the Hindus. It pervades the universe. It is a powerful\r\n\r\nmantra.  You can recite it 21 or 108 times. Depends. It cleanses\r\n\r\nyour Karma. Purifies your heart. It is a majestic sound.'\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, some Hindus will recite Om Nama Sivaya. \"Om\"\r\n\r\nin the Indonesian language means Uncle.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(In Malay)</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is Father for the Christians, for the Hindus,\r\n\r\nit  is  Uncle.   Both priests looked into the direction  of  the\r\n\r\nMuslim Imam. So he said in reply, \"We are close to our God  too.\r\n\r\nWe  only  need to climb the tower or minaret and call  His  name\r\n\r\nfive times a day.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the smiles on our faces in the House today\r\n\r\nwould also infect those outside of this Parliament till the wave\r\n\r\nof  tolerance is felt by our society. God willing, the universal\r\n\r\nsociety as well.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every morning the sun rises. Every afternoon it sets.\r\n\r\nIt  is  so simple. But in between the rising and setting of  the\r\n\r\nsun,  many  things happen.  Good or bad. We should work  towards\r\n\r\nthe good.   Towards peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us make our country a peaceful one, Darussalam, the\r\n\r\nLand of Peace.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for\r\n\r\nForeign  Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):  Mr Deputy Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  I  find  the anecdote given by Encik Sidek just  now  very\r\n\r\nfascinating.  I am still smiling, hoping that we would not  only\r\n\r\nbe close to God but also close to each other here.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to speak\r\n\r\non this Bill.  I rise in support of the Amendment Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is a secular state. But as I\r\n\r\nhave said before, unlike secular states in the West, and even in\r\n\r\nthe  Muslim majority Turkey, ours is quite unique.  I call  ours\r\n\r\n\"secularism with a soul\".\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way we handled the Administration of Muslim Law Act (or\r\n\r\nAMLA)  and  its  current  amendments in the  House  today,  bear\r\n\r\ntestimony  to that feeling.  This says a lot about the tolerance\r\n\r\nand  the understanding that exist in our multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore today.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, all the Members of the Select Committee are Muslims,\r\n\r\nbut  it was chaired by Mr Speaker, a non-Muslim, in his capacity\r\n\r\nas  the  Speaker  of Parliament.  I do not know how  Mr  Speaker\r\n\r\nfeels  about  Islam  or  about the Muslims,  but  I  admire  his\r\n\r\ntolerance  and  understanding  of  the  issue  at  hand.   I  am\r\n\r\nconfident, however, that the Select Committee sessions  that  we\r\n\r\nwent  through must have allowed Mr Speaker to better  understand\r\n\r\nhow  the  Muslims in Singapore feel about AMLA and to appreciate\r\n\r\ntheir aspirations.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admire, in fact, the patience of Mr Speaker. With your\r\n\r\nindulgence,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir, may I  cite  one  example.\r\n\r\nAfter  a long session and serious debate about the controversial\r\n\r\nissue of allowing the Civil Courts to hear ancillary matters  on\r\n\r\ndivorce,   the   representatives  of  the  Young  Women   Muslim\r\n\r\nAssociation, persisted with their arguments, refusing to relent.\r\n\r\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Select Committee  intervened,  reminding\r\n\r\ngently  that they were repeating the same points.  The President\r\n\r\nof the YWMA, Ms Fatimah Azimullah, persisted and argued further.\r\n\r\nThen the Chairman, Mr Speaker, interjected and assured them that\r\n\r\nthey  had made their point and that they would be given the last\r\n\r\nword.   And despite that, another member, Ms Sakina Yusof Kagda,\r\n\r\ninsisted  on  adding a few more \"last words\" to reinforce  their\r\n\r\nconcerns  and  to  clear  their conscience.   The  Chairman,  Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  then heard them patiently, still giving them the  last\r\n\r\nword.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, I hope this exercise would also give the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to  all Singaporeans, particularly non-Muslims,  to\r\n\r\nbetter  appreciate  what AMLA is about  and  what  it  means  to\r\n\r\nSingapore  Muslims  and to our multi-racial and  multi-religious\r\n\r\nSingapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, I trust this exercise will also allow\r\n\r\nMuslim  Singaporeans to better understand the position of  Islam\r\n\r\nand Muslims in secular and multi-religious Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims have their own Syariah Court and family and\r\n\r\npersonal  law  of  inheritance.   They  also  have  the   Muslim\r\n\r\nReligious  Council  (or MUIS) as a statutory board  to  regulate\r\n\r\nmatters  of  religious  life, including the  haj,  endowment  or\r\n\r\nwakaf,  halal food and mosques.  But the Muslims know and accept\r\n\r\nthat  they  are  still  an  integral part  of  our  multi-racial\r\n\r\nSingapore.   The  Muslims know that they are different  in  some\r\n\r\nways but they also realise that they cannot completely live in a\r\n\r\nsystem within a system divorced from mainstream Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always the need to remind ourselves about the\r\n\r\nbigger  picture while we tackle the specific needs of the Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity,  in  this case the AMLA amendments.   This  was  also\r\n\r\nachieved  in  the deliberations of the oral evidence,  including\r\n\r\nduring  the sessions with the Association of Religious  Teachers\r\n\r\n(Pergas), Jamiyah, Ms Noor Aisha Abdul Rahman, and a few others.\r\n\r\nThe   written  representations,  to  my  mind,  generally   also\r\n\r\nreflected  a  considerable level of maturity  about  the  issues\r\n\r\ndealt with.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad to note that this Select Committee had\r\n\r\nattracted  31 representations.  During the last Select Committee\r\n\r\non AMLA hearing in 1966, there were 18 submissions, and that too\r\n\r\nafter its closing date for submissions was extended three times.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the quality of the representations and the\r\n\r\npositive  approach taken by the Committee, many amendments  have\r\n\r\nsubsequently  been made to the earlier amendments and  presented\r\n\r\nby the Minister for Community Development and\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nMinister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi,  just\r\n\r\nnow.   This  again,  Sir,  speaks well of  the  system  and  the\r\n\r\nopenness therein.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments, no doubt, have strengthened both the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court  and the Majlis Ugama Islam (MUIS).   With  these\r\n\r\namendments,  I  am confident that the Muslim community  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to stand tall, as far as the administration of the  Muslim\r\n\r\nlaw is concerned.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt too that the system is not perfect.\r\n\r\nNeither  do I think there is presently a perfect system  in  the\r\n\r\nadministration of Muslim law in countries where  Muslims  are  a\r\n\r\nminority.  Even in Muslim majority countries, systems differ.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to look at Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, three\r\n\r\nof  our  ASEAN  neighbours with Muslim majority,  we  will  find\r\n\r\ndifferent levels and shades of implementation of the Muslim law.\r\n\r\nIf  we  were to compare the implementation of the administration\r\n\r\nof  Muslim  law  in Singapore with that of the  Philippines  and\r\n\r\nThailand,  two  other  ASEAN countries with  substantive  Muslim\r\n\r\nminority   population,  I  think  we  can  be   proud   of   our\r\n\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there were concerns expressed on the question of AMLA\r\n\r\nproposing to allow the Civil Courts to hear ancillary matters on\r\n\r\ndivorce.   True, there are areas where the Civil Courts handling\r\n\r\nancillary divorce matters could end up unIslamic in nature,  but\r\n\r\nas  explained by Minister Abdullah, they are marginal and  there\r\n\r\nwill   be   sufficient  safeguards  to  avoid   such   pitfalls.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,  there is a lot more to gain when Muslim Singaporeans\r\n\r\nare  allowed to benefit from vast state resources available from\r\n\r\nthe Civil Courts.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the sensitivity and the fear some may still\r\n\r\nhave,  despite the assurances, it is worthwhile for the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  and MUIS to closely monitor such ancillary divorce  cases\r\n\r\ngoing to the Civil Courts so as to avoid such complications.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, this recent exercise has shown what can\r\n\r\nbe done to improve\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nthe  Administration of Muslim Law in Singapore.  Yes,  many  had\r\n\r\nwished it should have been done much earlier, but more important\r\n\r\nnow,  progress  definitely has been made.  I am optimistic  that\r\n\r\nthere  will be more progress in the future.  I support the Bill,\r\n\r\nSir.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first, share my views on some of the principles and\r\n\r\nissues in this Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(1)  This is not just a Malay or Muslim Bill.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many in Singapore view this Bill as just another Malay\r\n\r\nor Muslim Bill.  They do not appreciate the ramification of this\r\n\r\nBill  to  the  larger  issue of race  relations.   I  hope  that\r\n\r\nSingaporeans can learn from the current regional situation  that\r\n\r\nthe  rest  of  Singapore  cannot  be  insulated  from  otherwise\r\n\r\nunrelated  religious problems if ethnic communities in Singapore\r\n\r\nor,  in the case, Malay-Muslim community feels that their  fears\r\n\r\nand concerns are not adequately appreciated or understood by the\r\n\r\nmajority of the Singapore population.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, this Bill is as much about Singapore as it is\r\n\r\nabout  Malay-Muslims in Singapore because the issues  have  wide\r\n\r\nimplications on the relationship between ethnic minority and the\r\n\r\nState.  This  Bill  is about managing the complexity  of  multi-racialism in Singapore.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(2)  Potential conflicts exist.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans may be unaware and ignorant of the fact\r\n\r\nthat  whenever a case involving matrimonial property and custody\r\n\r\nis being decided in court and given wide publicity in the press,\r\n\r\nthere is great anxiety and apprehension amongst the Malay-Muslim\r\n\r\npopulation  because of the concern that the decisions  taken  by\r\n\r\nthe  Civil  Court may be in conflict with Islam.   Many  Muslims\r\n\r\nhave  the  perception  that there are wide  differences  between\r\n\r\nMuslim  and civil laws although, in actual fact, there are  only\r\n\r\nslight, if any, differences between Syariah and civil laws\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nrelating to the maintenance, custody and division of property on\r\n\r\ndivorce.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, Sir, and it is also shared by those who\r\n\r\npresented  themselves at the Select Committee, the Civil  Courts\r\n\r\nhave  been extremely fair and sensitive when dealing with  cases\r\n\r\nthat  have implications on Islam.  I must compliment our  judges\r\n\r\nand journalists who have been very careful in dealing with these\r\n\r\nsensitive  issues.   I  think  they  have  done  their  jobs  so\r\n\r\nsuccessfully that a large section of our population  today  have\r\n\r\nbecome  unaware of the potential conflicts and problems some  of\r\n\r\nthese  cases  may bring.  Having said that, some of  the  Malay-Muslims  still fear that when the crunch comes, and there  is  a\r\n\r\nconflict  between  the interpretation of the Civil  and  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourts,  the Civil Court would never compromise its position  in\r\n\r\nterms  of  justice  and equity for the sake  of  any  particular\r\n\r\nreligion.    While  my  friends  in  the  predominantly   Muslim\r\n\r\nneighbouring  countries take comfort that should  there  be  any\r\n\r\nconflicts  between Islamic and civil laws, there will be  enough\r\n\r\npolitical or judicial intervention to ensure that the reputation\r\n\r\nof  Islam  is not compromised.  Some Malay-Muslims in  Singapore\r\n\r\nare  not  similarly  assured.  As ethnic minorities,  some  feel\r\n\r\ninadequate  in dictating or influencing the judicial process  as\r\n\r\ncan  be  done  in some other predominantly Muslim countries  and\r\n\r\ntherefore  are concerned that the Civil Court may not adequately\r\n\r\nconsider Islamic interpretation when making its decisions.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(3)  Participation and consensus.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I compliment the Minister for referring the Bill to the\r\n\r\nSelect  Committee  for  out of it has  come  numerous  practical\r\n\r\nsuggestions  and recommendations that have resulted  in  further\r\n\r\namendments  to  the Bill.  Perhaps another less obvious  but  no\r\n\r\nless  significant consequence is the fact that  the  process  of\r\n\r\nparticipation  by  a large cross section of the  community  from\r\n\r\nprofessionals  to  Ulamas, social workers and community  leaders\r\n\r\nhave brought about a sense of collective ownership and a strong\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ndesire that the amendments represent a process that would  bring\r\n\r\nthe  present status closer to the aspirations of the  community.\r\n\r\nThere  is today a sense that each and every Malay-Muslim counts.\r\n\r\nThat  each  has  a  role  to  play in strengthening  the  social\r\n\r\ninstitutions  like  the Syariah Court and  overcoming  the  many\r\n\r\nproblems that continue to beset the community.  Whilst some  may\r\n\r\ndisagree  with a number of specific provisions proposed  in  the\r\n\r\namendments, what cannot be denied is that the Bill requires  the\r\n\r\nmoral  support of all Malay-Muslims if we are to see  solid  and\r\n\r\nvisible improvements.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this sense of ownership can be translated into\r\n\r\naction,  for example, volunteers and social workers to help  the\r\n\r\ncounselling  process of those contemplating divorce,  especially\r\n\r\nnow  that  this  process can be delegated to the  community  and\r\n\r\nlawyers  and other professionals to help strengthen the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt that is extremely short of trained resources and lacks the\r\n\r\nexperience in handling complex Muslim issues.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also not disputed is the fact that there is a\r\n\r\nstrong desire in the community to develop the Syariah Court into\r\n\r\na  full-fledged  Family  Court when it has  acquired  sufficient\r\n\r\nexperience in establishing the tradition and jurisprudence  that\r\n\r\nwould  enable it to handle increasingly complex problems of  our\r\n\r\nsociety.   This is an issue that confronts many Muslim societies\r\n\r\nthe  world  over.   With good support from the community,  I  am\r\n\r\nconfident that Singapore can develop a unique model of balancing\r\n\r\nSyariah and civil laws that can serve as an example to the multi-racial society the world over.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(4) Malay Paradox.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, coming to terms with multi-racialism. Sir, there\r\n\r\nis  also  the view that the aspirations of the Malay-Muslims  in\r\n\r\nSingapore to have an independent and full-fledged Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nis  a  sign  of Malay-Muslim fundamentalism in Singapore.   Sir,\r\n\r\nthis  is  an incorrect assessment.  In my view, there  exists  a\r\n\r\nparadox in the Malay-Muslim community and in\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nfact in the heart and soul of a Malay-Muslim Singaporean.  As an\r\n\r\nindividual,  we  are  expected to reflect  and  demonstrate  our\r\n\r\nevangelical spirit and be a role model to other Muslims.  Malay-Muslim  leaders, either in politics or in community, because  of\r\n\r\ntheir  privileged position and the influence that they may  have\r\n\r\non  society, are also expected to be the protector, defender and\r\n\r\ncrusader  of  Islam.  This is especially so in  Singapore  where\r\n\r\nMalay-Muslims  are  ethnic minorities, where increasing  complex\r\n\r\nsocial  problems  are seen as a result of  the  social  ills  of\r\n\r\nmodernisation  and westernisation and where Islam is  considered\r\n\r\nas the only force that is capable of confronting this influence.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the dilemma is that Malay-Muslim leaders, by virtue of\r\n\r\ntheir position in society, must necessarily be more aware of the\r\n\r\nmulti-racial dynamics of the Singapore society and therefore are\r\n\r\nconstantly  put  under  pressure  to  balance  the  secular  and\r\n\r\nreligious  interest of the community without being unnecessarily\r\n\r\ncompromising   in   dealing  with  this  conflicting   interest.\r\n\r\nIndividually,  Malay-Muslim Singaporeans are still  looking  and\r\n\r\ncoming to terms with balancing the religious and secular values.\r\n\r\nSome are still searching to find the comfort zone where they can\r\n\r\nbe  completely  Malay-Muslim and wholeheartedly  and  absolutely\r\n\r\nSingaporean in our multi-racial society.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(5) A society in transition.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, historical perspective. Even during the empires\r\n\r\nof the Caliphate from AD 632 to 661, there were separate syariah\r\n\r\nand  non-syariah jurisdiction.  I quote from S.E. Finer  on  The\r\n\r\nHistory of Government from the Earliest Times:\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The caliphs set up syariah courts, conducted by trained\r\n\r\nspecialists, the gadis, but because so much of syariah  law  was\r\n\r\nunsuited  and  unaccommodated to the running of the  state,  the\r\n\r\ncaliphs  had  also established their own court  whose  principal\r\n\r\nduty  had been to deal with complaints against and between their\r\n\r\nofficials.  It was an \"administrative court\" of complaints,  the\r\n\r\nmazalim.    To   remedy  the  syariah  courts'  inadequacy   for\r\n\r\nadministering  the  empire, they attracted  into  these  mazalim\r\n\r\ncourts  entire  classes of business relating to statecraft.   It\r\n\r\nwas by these steps that the empire came\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nto   have   one  law   -   the  syariah   -   but  two  separate\r\n\r\njurisdictions:  the  syariah jurisdiction  and  the  non-syariah\r\n\r\njurisdiction, that is, the caliphal one, not unacceptable to the\r\n\r\nulama  who had always recognised that he had the right to define\r\n\r\nthe  jurisdiction  of the syariah court.  So, while  the  latter\r\n\r\nhandled  religious, family and most civil matters  like  police,\r\n\r\ntaxation, criminal justice, and military affairs fell within the\r\n\r\ncaliphal jurisdiction.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even in modern Islamic history, we could see that one\r\n\r\nof  the  crucial  issues defining the political  future  is  the\r\n\r\nrelationship of Islamic forces and democratic political systems.\r\n\r\nCompetition,  cooperation  and conflict  are  amongst  the  most\r\n\r\nimportant dimensions of Muslim life.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Malaysia to Morocco, Indonesia to India, societies are\r\n\r\nconcerned  with  the compatibility of Islam  and  democracy  and\r\n\r\ntheir  respective  roles in the political  evolution  of  Muslim\r\n\r\nsocieties.   While  in some of these countries,  revolution  and\r\n\r\nreformation are characteristics of this process, we in Singapore\r\n\r\ncan  and  should take a more evolutionary approach  in  managing\r\n\r\nthis process.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to some of the more specific provisions of\r\n\r\nthe  Bill.   There  were genuine concerns  that  allowing  Civil\r\n\r\nCourts  to  hear  ancillary matters on divorce  may  dilute  the\r\n\r\npowers  of  the Syariah Court.  I am, however, of the view  that\r\n\r\nthere now exist sufficient safeguards to ensure that Muslims, as\r\n\r\na  matter  of  choice, will go to the Syariah Court  to  resolve\r\n\r\ntheir disputes, that is, requiring parties to seek leave of  the\r\n\r\nSyariah  Court and provision for counselling even  if  there  is\r\n\r\nmutual  consent  by  both parties to go to the  Civil  Court  to\r\n\r\nsettle their disputes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Syariah Court is the people's court. Utlimately,\r\n\r\nthe  status and reputation of the Syariah Court depends  on  the\r\n\r\nsupport it gets from the community.  While it may be possible to\r\n\r\nregulate  and  make it mandatory for people  to  go  to  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt, this alone may not necessarily ensure the good reputation\r\n\r\nof  the  Syariah Court.  Besides, Malays have progressed so  far\r\n\r\nthat  there are complex issues, for example, involving  overseas\r\n\r\nproperties  and  other assets that may be too  complex  for  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court alone to shoulder this responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(6) Strengthening the Syariah Court.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the various initiatives to strengthen the Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  to  review  the administrative measures,  procedures  and\r\n\r\nmanpower  needs  and  the call for Muslims  to  volunteer  their\r\n\r\nservices  towards this cause.  We can all agree on the  ultimate\r\n\r\ngoal  of  having a full-fledged Syariah Court but may differ  on\r\n\r\nthe pace and time it will take to achieve this.  But we must  be\r\n\r\ncareful to ensure that our hopes and wishes are matched  by  the\r\n\r\ncapacity  and  the capability of the Syariah Court  to  shoulder\r\n\r\nthis responsibility.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>(7) Future amendments to separate laws for AMLA and MUIS.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we have separate laws for AMLA\r\n\r\nand MUIS to reflect the different roles and responsibilities  of\r\n\r\nMUIS  and  the Syariah Court and to give these two matters  more\r\n\r\nspecific focus and attention.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, with these amendments, we have, in my\r\n\r\nopinion, the necessary prerequisites to make the Syariah Court a\r\n\r\ngreat  Muslim  Family  Court.  More importantly,  those  seeking\r\n\r\nlegal  remedies can now expect better and prompt service because\r\n\r\njustice is also about efficiency and productivity.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly by no means the last amendment to the\r\n\r\nBill.   As  we progress, we will need to amend AMLA periodically\r\n\r\nto  keep  pace with the progress and aspirations of  the  Malay-Muslim  society.  For now, Sir, only a solid endorsement by  all\r\n\r\nconcerned  is the most appropriate support that we can  give  to\r\n\r\nthis Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Select\r\n\r\nCommittee   has  received  31  proposals.   The  Committee   has\r\n\r\npainstakingly  examined all the proposals and  has  incorporated\r\n\r\nmany  of  the proposals by the Members of this House as well  as\r\n\r\nmembers of the public.  This is very encouraging, Sir.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been representations both from individuals as\r\n\r\nwell  as  Muslim organisations.  This is encouraging.  The  Bill\r\n\r\nhas\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\nbenefited from the public representation.  It is important  that\r\n\r\nthis legislation will reflect the social norm of our time.  This\r\n\r\nHouse  must be prepared to change laws which need to be amended,\r\n\r\nand AMLA is such a law.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one concern which I would\r\n\r\nlike to share with this House.  Other Bills which were committed\r\n\r\nto  a  Select  Committee, the representation made by  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity  was  not  very encouraging.  May  I  urge  the  Malay\r\n\r\ncommunity leaders that they should be forthcoming and air  their\r\n\r\nviews  on  national issues as well, not just on  Muslim  issues.\r\n\r\nThe minority community should participate in activities from the\r\n\r\ngrassroots level to the national level.  Only in this  way,  can\r\n\r\nwe build community bonding and multi-racialism.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my other NMP colleagues and I have received a letter\r\n\r\nfrom  one  Muslim group, and there have been some serious  views\r\n\r\nexpressed in the letter.  I would like to assure the group  that\r\n\r\nI  have  considered  their views very  carefully  and  I  cannot\r\n\r\nsupport  them.   One  of  the  proposals  was  that  the  AMLA's\r\n\r\namendment  would  in fact contravene the Constitution  which,  I\r\n\r\nthink,  is  not  correct.  No provision of the  Constitution  is\r\n\r\nbeing contravened and that proposition has no foundation at all.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like to assure the group that their view  was\r\n\r\nrepresented  in the Select Committee.  The Select Committee  had\r\n\r\npublished  and considered their view.  Nevertheless, since  they\r\n\r\nhad  written  to the NMPs, we owe a duty to have  this  publicly\r\n\r\naired.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must bear in mind that not all\r\n\r\nproposals  before  any Select Committee can be  accepted.   Only\r\n\r\nproposals  that are workable and within the legal framework  can\r\n\r\nbe  accepted.  Therefore, many representors may be wondering why\r\n\r\ntheir  views have not been heard or accepted.  The simple reason\r\n\r\nis that only views which will reflect the majority view and will\r\n\r\nbe good for the Bill are accepted.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the civil law and the syariah law are going to operate\r\n\r\nside by side.  The Muslim\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\ncommunity  has  a  choice.  I would like to  assure  the  Muslim\r\n\r\ncommunity  that the civil jurisdiction does not  take  away  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  position.   Whenever the law is being  interpreted,  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  position  is considered by the judges.   Another  aspect\r\n\r\nwhich  I would like to share is this.  We should strengthen  the\r\n\r\nSyariah Court's position, as is being done in the Family  Court.\r\n\r\nWe  should  allow  for more mediations and discussions  to  help\r\n\r\npeople who are going through a dispute.  In the past years,  the\r\n\r\nFamily Division of the Subordinate Court has done very well.   I\r\n\r\nhope  the  Minister will take this point and advise the  Syariah\r\n\r\nCourt  that it should treat legal dispute for hearing as a  last\r\n\r\nresort.   After  all, we are an Asian society and  the  practice\r\n\r\nthat  has  been  followed  in  the Family  Court  is  worthy  of\r\n\r\nconsideration.  I would seriously urge the Minister to  get  his\r\n\r\nofficials to look at it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that some of the proposals have been\r\n\r\naccepted.  I am also glad that we will have two Presidents,  one\r\n\r\nof  them would be senior, ad-hoc Presidents and a Registrar  who\r\n\r\nwill  help in the administrative work.  And I would suggest that\r\n\r\nwe should have a Deputy Registrar, if necessary.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, first, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  thank  the  Members who  have  expressed  their\r\n\r\nwidespread and strong support for the Bill.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sidek and\r\n\r\nMr  Zainul, in their own inimitable way, spoke at length of  the\r\n\r\nneed  for  tolerance,  understanding and  mutual  respect  in  a\r\n\r\nsociety like ours, especially in areas where things spiritual  - faith, religion, beliefs  -  come into contact with the secular,\r\n\r\nthe  need  for  accommodation and the  need  for  reconciliation\r\n\r\nbetween these two spheres.  I share this sentiment, Sir, and  it\r\n\r\nis  indeed in this spirit that the amendments to AMLA are  being\r\n\r\nproposed.   As suggested by Mr Zainul, the Syariah Court,  MUIS,\r\n\r\nand  certainly my Ministry, will monitor the progress  of  these\r\n\r\namendments  to  ensure that if things need  to  be  reviewed  or\r\n\r\nimproved upon, we would certainly do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli spoke about our multi-racial society. I\r\n\r\ncan readily appreciate and emphathise with the Member's points\r\n\r\non the sensitivities and the issues of concern in our society\r\n\r\nand the need to consider our multi-racial and multi-cultural\r\n\r\ncontext in anything we do.  As for AMLA and MUIS to be treated\r\n\r\nseparately, it is, I think, a separate issue and one which will\r\n\r\nhave to be studied very closely, especially the implications of\r\n\r\nthe separation.  I agree with the Member on the need to monitor\r\n\r\nthe progress of the amendments, and we would certainly do so.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Rai supported the Bill too. I am aware of the complaint\r\n\r\nfrom  the  three  persons whom Mr Rai mentioned and  the  trio's\r\n\r\nattempts  at  lobbying the NMPs to pursue their  cause  in  this\r\n\r\nParliament.   I have checked the allegations and arguments  with\r\n\r\nthe  relevant  experts  and they are  of  the  view  that  these\r\n\r\nallegations  and arguments are misconceived and  without  basis.\r\n\r\nAs  to  mediation, whether it should be encouraged, I think  the\r\n\r\nMember  would be pleased to note that there is indeed a  culture\r\n\r\nof  mediation in the Syariah Court, and it is certainly an  area\r\n\r\nwhich we will develop further.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has gone through extensive consultations, study\r\n\r\nand  discussions by individuals, organisations and  experts  and\r\n\r\namong  the Malay MPs and the institutions concerned.   I  accept\r\n\r\nthat not everyone would accept every amendment to AMLA.  Indeed,\r\n\r\nI  think  it is unreasonable for us to expect this.  But  I  am,\r\n\r\nSir, comforted by the fact that almost everyone agrees that,  as\r\n\r\na  whole,  the amendments serve to strengthen the Syariah  Court\r\n\r\nand  also MUIS, the two important institutions to Muslims  here.\r\n\r\nI  think this is how we should look at the Bill.  Each amendment\r\n\r\nis  like a piece of mosaic, each fitting into each other  to  be\r\n\r\nbuilt  into  a very fine mural which no single piece  of  mosaic\r\n\r\nwould be able to conjure, no matter how ugly or attractive  that\r\n\r\nindividual  piece  of mosaic is.  I would like  to  commend  the\r\n\r\nMuslim  community  to  adopt  this  approach.

While we have promoted competition  in\r\n\r\nthe   banking  industry,  MAS  has  restricted  foreign   banks'\r\n\r\nactivities in the domestic retail markets to protect  and  build\r\n\r\nup local banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign banks are subject to limits on opening branches,\r\n\r\nsetting   up   off-premise  ATMs,  participating  in  shared-ATM\r\n\r\nnetworks and offering Electronic Funds Transfer at Point-of-Sale\r\n\r\n(EFTPOS) services. Nevertheless they enjoy a larger market share\r\n\r\nin  Singapore than elsewhere in Asia, or in any major  financial\r\n\r\ncentre.   They  compete freely with local banks in many  banking\r\n\r\nactivities ranging from wholesale domestic banking, to  treasury\r\n\r\nand capital market activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The banking system is a key component of our economy.\r\n\r\nStrong  domestic  banks  anchored in  Singapore  have  interests\r\n\r\nclosely  aligned to the interests of Singapore.  They  are  more\r\n\r\nlikely to take a long term view of the business, especially in a\r\n\r\ncrisis. A financial system in which the local banks have a large\r\n\r\nmarket  share  is  therefore  likely  to  be  more  stable   and\r\n\r\nresilient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, globalisation and rapid technological change are\r\n\r\ntransforming the banking environment globally. Inevitably,  this\r\n\r\nmeans  more  foreign competition for local banks,  for  example,\r\n\r\nthrough  Internet  banking  or  non-bank  institutions  offering\r\n\r\nfinancial  services.  MAS could retard the process by tightening\r\n\r\nregulatory  restrictions on foreign banks. But that  would  mean\r\n\r\nshielding  the local banks from pressures to upgrade,  depriving\r\n\r\nSingaporeans  of  quality  banking  services,  and  making   the\r\n\r\nultimate adjustment more traumatic, when change can no longer be\r\n\r\npostponed and the barriers finally come down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition, not protection, is the best way to upgrade the\r\n\r\nindustry,  and  develop  strong and  robust  local  banks  which\r\n\r\nmeasure  up  against the best international players. Competition\r\n\r\nwill  encourage  local  banks to rationalise  their  operations,\r\n\r\nfurther  exploit  economies of scale and deliver  efficient  and\r\n\r\ninnovative  services comparable to the best available  in  other\r\n\r\nmajor financial centres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By taking steps to liberalise the banking industry now, we\r\n\r\ncan pro-actively manage this change. But we cannot simply remove\r\n\r\nall  restrictions overnight because the industry needs  time  to\r\n\r\nadjust  to  the new environment, and we must maintain confidence\r\n\r\nand stability in the banking system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transition from the present state to the new one must\r\n\r\nbe  paced so as not to jeopardise this confidence and stability.\r\n\r\nMAS is, therefore, drawing up a 5-year programme to do this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government needs to shape the final outcome of the\r\n\r\nliberalisation, and not leave things purely to chance.  Our  aim\r\n\r\nis  to have an open banking sector with strong local banks,  not\r\n\r\nan  industry  from which local banks have been marginalised.  We\r\n\r\nwill  liberalise  in such a way as to allow  and  encourage  the\r\n\r\nlocal  banks to upgrade themselves into strong players.  We  are\r\n\r\nconfident they will use the next five years to do so.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4></h4></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has been discussing its plans with the local banks,\r\n\r\nboth  to seek their feedback, and to impress on them the urgency\r\n\r\nof  change.  At  the same time, MAS has also been  meeting  with\r\n\r\nforeign  banks to discuss how we can encourage strong and  well-managed  foreign  institutions to make  further  commitments  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  and take a stake in the growth and stability  of  our\r\n\r\nfinancial system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The local banks are well run for their size, and are highly\r\n\r\nrated  compared  with  other Asian  banks.  But  they  lack  the\r\n\r\neconomies of scale to hold their own against foreign banks  that\r\n\r\noperate  globally.   If  the  local banks  can  consolidate  and\r\n\r\nrationalise,  and  continue to build up and attract  outstanding\r\n\r\nmanagement   teams,  they  can  upgrade  their  operations   and\r\n\r\nservices,  earn  better  returns for  shareholders,  and  become\r\n\r\nstronger players both in Singapore and the region. That is  what\r\n\r\nMAS is encouraging the local banks to do. However, MAS is not in\r\n\r\na  position to compel the banks to merge, let alone dictate  who\r\n\r\nis  to  merge  with  whom.   That can only  be  decided  by  the\r\n\r\nshareholders of the bank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Traditionally, MNCs in Singapore have chosen to bank\r\n\r\nwith  large  international banks with which they have  a  global\r\n\r\nbanking  relationship, while our domestic  banks  have  built  a\r\n\r\nprofitable franchise lending to the SMEs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike some other countries, we have not maintained a\r\n\r\nprotected   and   inefficient  sector  of  domestic   companies,\r\n\r\ninsulated  from  the  efficient,  export-oriented  part  of  the\r\n\r\neconomy.  Instead  we  have  encouraged  domestic  companies  to\r\n\r\nupgrade and compete, because that is the only way they can offer\r\n\r\nwell-paying jobs to Singaporeans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since lending by local banks has always been on a\r\n\r\ncommercial  basis,  any  merger  of  banks  resulting  from  the\r\n\r\nliberalisation of the banking sector should not adversely affect\r\n\r\ncredit  available to SMEs. Indeed SMEs will be  best  served  by\r\n\r\nstrong local banks providing efficient and innovative services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>ANSETT AUSTRALIA</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Finance if\r\n\r\nSingapore  Airlines had consulted Air New Zealand before  making\r\n\r\nthe bid for Ansett Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIA's decision to acquire a 50% stake in Ansett from News\r\n\r\nLimited is made based on commercial considerations.
