Since  March/April  this  year,  we  have\r\n\r\nstepped  up our mosquito surveys and control  with\r\n\r\nsearch  and destroy operations. Nine per  cent  of\r\n\r\nthe  44,530 household premises were found breeding\r\n\r\nmosquitoes.  In construction sites  the  situation\r\n\r\nwas  even  worse. Over 50 per cent of  some  2,363\r\n\r\nconstruction   sites  were  also  found   breeding\r\n\r\nmosquitoes. Over the last three months alone, some\r\n\r\n2,000  orders  and 350 summonses  were  served  on\r\n\r\nhouseholds and contractors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous weekly surveys carried out by the\r\n\r\nMinistry   of   the  Environment  have   disclosed\r\n\r\ndistinct  areas  of  high  incidence  of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding. Action to eradicate mosquitoes in  these\r\n\r\nareas has commenced with the application of swing-fogging with a non-toxic insecticide into each and\r\n\r\nevery  premises.  So far about 4,000  premises  in\r\n\r\nOutram  Road, Tiong Bahru, Jalan Bukit  Merah  and\r\n\r\nGeylang  have been so treated. The operation  will\r\n\r\ncontinue in Rochore and Beach Road areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the above statistics, it can be seen that\r\n\r\nfar  from  being  inactive, as  suggested  by  the\r\n\r\nMember  for  River Valley, my Ministry  has  taken\r\n\r\nfirm action against mosquito breeders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware of any recent reorganisation of\r\n\r\nthe  vector  control  services.  The  control   of\r\n\r\nmosquitoes has always been under the Districts and\r\n\r\nunder  the  charge of Assistant Commissioners.  In\r\n\r\n1971,  there  was a reorganisation of  the  Vector\r\n\r\nControl  Section  of  the Districts  in  that  the\r\n\r\nSections  were  brought under the  charge  of  the\r\n\r\nSenior  Public  Health  Inspectors  in  charge  of\r\n\r\ncleansing.   This   was   necessary   to   improve\r\n\r\nadministration  and  to make vector  control  more\r\n\r\neffective as mosquito breeding, as Members are all\r\n\r\naware, is related to cleansing of the drains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vector Control and Research Branch is\r\n\r\nresponsible   for   research  and   advising   the\r\n\r\nDistricts of the various actions to be taken.  The\r\n\r\nChief  Vector Control Officer is the  expert  and,\r\n\r\nsince   April,  he  has  been  advising  and   co-ordinating operations against mosquito breeding by the Districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is necessary to explain in detail the\r\n\r\ntype  of mosquitoes that we are dealing with.  The\r\n\r\nAedes  mosquitoes, which are the carriers  of  the\r\n\r\nDengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever, breed  in  relatively\r\n\r\nclean water and usually are found in rain water in\r\n\r\ncontainers. These are usually found in households,\r\n\r\nconstruction sites, and in open spaces, but seldom\r\n\r\nin  polluted, dirty drains. The Culex  mosquitoes,\r\n\r\nwhich  are not the carriers of Dengue Haemorrhagic\r\n\r\nFever,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbreed  in polluted water. From the above examples,\r\n\r\nMembers  will  note that there  are  thousands  of\r\n\r\nplaces  that  these Aedes mosquitoes could  breed,\r\n\r\nand  it  is  near impossible for any authority  to\r\n\r\ncarry  out a house-to-house search throughout  the\r\n\r\nentire  city at any one time, especially when  the\r\n\r\nbreeding  cycle  of  mosquitoes  is  very   short,\r\n\r\nnormally one week. The recent increase in mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding is mainly attributable to the increase in\r\n\r\nrainfall   over   the   last   few   months,   bad\r\n\r\nhousekeeping in the numerous construction sites as\r\n\r\na   result   of  rapid  urbanisation,   and   more\r\n\r\ngenerally,  the  complacency and  neglect  of  the\r\n\r\npublic   to  take  control  measures  within   the\r\n\r\npremises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Ministry participated in a seminar\r\n\r\non  \"Mosquito  Control in Construction  Sites\"  in\r\n\r\nconjunction   with   the  Singapore   Contractors'\r\n\r\nAssociation, the Singapore Institute of Architects\r\n\r\nand  the Singapore Institute of Engineers. The aim\r\n\r\nof these talks is to inform and educate the people\r\n\r\ninvolved  of  the dangers of these mosquitoes  and\r\n\r\nseek   their  co-operation  in  eradicating   this\r\n\r\nmenace.  The Ministry has also been issuing  press\r\n\r\nreleases  over the last few months on the mosquito\r\n\r\nsituation,  but  I regret to say  that  the  press\r\n\r\nreports have not given wide publicity, which  they\r\n\r\ndeserve,  to  the warnings on Dengue  Haemorrhagic\r\n\r\nFever and also on the necessity to take preventive\r\n\r\nmeasures.  The most effective means of  preventing\r\n\r\nany  outbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever is,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, to stop mosquito breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must reiterate that the control of mosquitoes\r\n\r\nis  very  much  the  duty  and  responsibility  of\r\n\r\nhouseholders, contractors and, in fact, all of us.\r\n\r\nUnless  the  public  plays its part,  the  present\r\n\r\noutbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever may get  out\r\n\r\nof control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>LAND ACQUISITION AT SEMBAWANG</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for Law\r\n\r\nand  National  Development if the  Government  has\r\n\r\nacquired\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  59  lots  of land at Sembawang; what  is  the\r\n\r\npurpose  of  the acquisition; when development  of\r\n\r\nthe  land is expected to take place; and how  will\r\n\r\nthe  people,  who are affected by the acquisition,\r\n\r\nbe compensated and resettled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the 59 lots referred to by the\r\n\r\nMember  for Sembawang were gazetted on  21st  May,\r\n\r\n1973,  for  compulsory acquisition for the  second\r\n\r\nphase  of  the development of Woodlands New  Town.\r\n\r\nClearance  of  those affected by the second  phase\r\n\r\ndevelopment of this New Town will be undertaken by\r\n\r\nthe  Resettlement Department of  the  Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment  Board  after the  completion  of  the\r\n\r\nfirst  phase which is now in progress.

The figures on the number\r\n\r\nof  cases  and deaths were from a feature  article\r\n\r\npublished  by a Senior Lecturer of the  Department\r\n\r\nof  Bacteriology,  University  of  Singapore.  The\r\n\r\nDepartment   of   Bacteriology   undertakes    the\r\n\r\nlaboratory diagnosis of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever.\r\n\r\nThis is done by way of tests on blood samples sent\r\n\r\nfrom  the  hospitals and out-patient  dispensaries\r\n\r\nfrom  patients  suspected  to  be  suffering  from\r\n\r\nDengue  Haemorrhagic Fever.  To  be  certain,  the\r\n\r\ntests  are  required to be repeated after  two  to\r\n\r\nfour weeks. It should, however, be noted that  the\r\n\r\nfigures from the Department were incomplete as not\r\n\r\nall  suspected cases had their blood sent  to  the\r\n\r\nlaboratory and a second blood specimen  could  not\r\n\r\nalways be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The failure to make an official announcement on\r\n\r\nthe  outbreak of Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever was due\r\n\r\nto  lack of information initially and later  by  a\r\n\r\nlack  of  co-ordination between  the  Ministry  of\r\n\r\nHealth  and  the Ministry of the Environment.  The\r\n\r\ninitial  lack of information was due to  the  slow\r\n\r\nbuildup of cases over the average \"background\"  of\r\n\r\ncases. Since the disease can\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nonly be definitively diagnosed by laboratory tests\r\n\r\nwhich  require two blood specimens taken after  an\r\n\r\ninterval  of  two to four weeks, the outbreak  was\r\n\r\nnot  evident  until a lapse of time.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nremembered  that  Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever   is\r\n\r\nendemic  in  Singapore and cases occur  throughout\r\n\r\nthe year as the figures show since 1966.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reports of cases occurring in the hospitals\r\n\r\nwere sent, as is the normal practice, directly  to\r\n\r\nthe  Epidemiology  Unit of  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment,  which should have been the  official\r\n\r\nsource of information when it became evident  that\r\n\r\nan  outbreak  had  occurred.  The  absence  of  an\r\n\r\nofficial   announcement   is   because   of   poor\r\n\r\ncommunication   and  co-ordination   between   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  and  the  Ministry  of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment.  The Ministry of the Environment  had\r\n\r\ntaken  over  the responsibility of public  health,\r\n\r\nwhich  included  the Epidemiology  Unit  from  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Health  when  the  Ministry  of  the\r\n\r\nEnvironment  was  established  in  September  last\r\n\r\nyear.  This deficiency in co-ordination,  however,\r\n\r\nwill  be  put right by regular meetings of  a  Co-ordination  Committee on Epidemic  Diseases  which\r\n\r\nhas  been formed comprising officials from the two\r\n\r\nMinistries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (b), regarding the\r\n\r\ndiscrepancies between the figures purported to  be\r\n\r\nreported   by   the   various   authorities,   the\r\n\r\nexplanation  is as follows. Firstly,  no  official\r\n\r\nrelease on the number of cases and deaths was made\r\n\r\nby  the  Ministry of Health. This was because  the\r\n\r\nreports  from  the hospitals were presumptive  and\r\n\r\ncould   have   included  other  fevers   such   as\r\n\r\ninfluenza,   encephalitis,  while  the  laboratory\r\n\r\nreports   were  retrospective.  Secondly,  figures\r\n\r\nquoted in the press as coming from the Ministry of\r\n\r\nHealth  were  probably  obtained  from  unofficial\r\n\r\nsources.  In answer to sub-question (c), regarding\r\n\r\nthe   actual   figures,  both  of  incidence   and\r\n\r\nmortality, the total numbers for the period  April\r\n\r\nto  July 1973 were 207 cases and 20 deaths.  These\r\n\r\nfigures were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreported  by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof the Environment and should again be regarded as\r\n\r\npresumptive.  Without an autopsy it could  not  be\r\n\r\nabsolutely certain that all the deaths were due to\r\n\r\nDengue Haemorrhagic Fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (d), Dengue\r\n\r\nHaemorrhagic Fever is not a notifiable disease. It\r\n\r\nis,  however,  by  administrative  directive  made\r\n\r\nnotifiable  within the Ministry's  services.  This\r\n\r\nwas  for the purpose of identifying areas of Aedes\r\n\r\nmosquito   breeding   and   for   assessing    the\r\n\r\neffectiveness  of  mosquito  eradication  measures\r\n\r\nover  a  period of time. Generally, the object  of\r\n\r\nmaking   a   disease  notifiable  is  one   or   a\r\n\r\ncombination of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) in the case of a dangerous infectious\r\n\r\ndisease  where  immediate steps  are  required  to\r\n\r\ncontrol   the   disease.  This  is   required   by\r\n\r\ninternational agreement. The purpose is  to  alert\r\n\r\nthe  international community to  take  appropriate\r\n\r\nsteps  against the disease. These are mainly steps\r\n\r\nin  sanitation and in protective measures. In  the\r\n\r\ncase   of  Dengue  Haemorrhagic  Fever,  the  only\r\n\r\neffective  measure  against  the  disease  is  the\r\n\r\neradication  of the Aedes mosquito vectors.  There\r\n\r\nare  no  protective measures such as immunisation.\r\n\r\nFurther,  unlike Malaria, personal  protection  by\r\n\r\nsleeping   under  mosquito  nets,  using  mosquito\r\n\r\nrepellents are of limited value, as the mosquitoes\r\n\r\ntend to be \"afternoon biters\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) for epidemiology studies - mainly the\r\n\r\ncollection   and   tabulation   of   figures   and\r\n\r\nstatistics.  In  a limited way the  administrative\r\n\r\ninstruction for notification of the disease by the\r\n\r\nGovernment institutions is for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information is useful for a comprehensive long-term prevention programme of the disease. In the\r\n\r\ncase of dengue fever, there is only one action  to\r\n\r\nbe  taken,  that is, the eradication  of  mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding.  This  is  a continuous  and  continuing\r\n\r\ncampaign  taken  whether or  not  the  disease  is\r\n\r\npresent or peaking. The experts in my Ministry are\r\n\r\nnot yet satisfied that this disease is so easily\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  quickly  identifiable as to make notification\r\n\r\nin law useful for immediate counter action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Incidence in Outram Road General Hospital)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nHealth and Home Affairs if he is aware that in the\r\n\r\npresent  Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)  outbreak\r\n\r\n(i)  many children had been warded with DHF in the\r\n\r\nOutram  Road  General Hospital; (ii) Aedes  vector\r\n\r\nmosquitoes  were detected in the Hospital  itself;\r\n\r\nand  (iii)  at least two doctors who  attended  to\r\n\r\nthose patients have themselves come down with DHF;\r\n\r\nand  what action the Medical Superintendent of the\r\n\r\nHospital   has  taken  to  prevent   the   disease\r\n\r\nspreading from that focal point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to\r\n\r\nsub-question (i), the number of children warded in\r\n\r\nthe  Outram Road General Hospital reported to have\r\n\r\nDengue Haemorrhagic Fever for the period April  to\r\n\r\nJuly 1973 was 103.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (ii), cases of\r\n\r\nmosquito  nuisance have been reported  within  the\r\n\r\nlarge  expanse of hospital grounds  from  time  to\r\n\r\ntime.  However, previous surveys have  shown  that\r\n\r\nmosquito breeding did not necessarily occur within\r\n\r\nthe  Outram  Road  General  Hospital  grounds  but\r\n\r\noccurred  also in building sites adjacent  to  the\r\n\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of April 1973, the Commissioner\r\n\r\nof  Public Health was requested to do a survey  of\r\n\r\npossible mosquito breeding within the Outram  Road\r\n\r\nGeneral  Hospital grounds. On 7th  May,  1973,  he\r\n\r\nreported a hole between Ward 8 and the Radiography\r\n\r\nbuilding, which has since been sealed with cement.\r\n\r\nAnother  report revealed breeding in  a  discarded\r\n\r\nplastic  basin  in an open space at  the  rear  of\r\n\r\nresidential  quarters,  Houses  Nos.  416-21   New\r\n\r\nBridge Road.

These were occupied by private\r\n\r\ntenants on a temporary occupation licence, and the\r\n\r\nCommissioner  of  Public Health was  requested  to\r\n\r\ndeal   directly   with  these  persons.   Mosquito\r\n\r\nbreeding was also found in a drain at a slope from\r\n\r\nSepoy Flats towards Silat School and in a concrete\r\n\r\ndrain  at  the  servants' quarters behind  Brebner\r\n\r\nHouse   nurses'   quarters.   The   Public   Works\r\n\r\nDepartment had previously been requested to repair\r\n\r\nthis faulty drain. Follow-up action was then taken\r\n\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth report received indicated that there\r\n\r\nwas  some mosquito breeding near the reservoir  in\r\n\r\nCollege  Road.  The University  of  Singapore  was\r\n\r\ninformed  as  this parcel of land was under  their\r\n\r\ncontrol. The Hospital authorities have been active\r\n\r\nin  adopting  anti-mosquito  measures  inside  and\r\n\r\noutside the compounds of the Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to sub-question (iii), it was possible\r\n\r\nthat  the  two doctors mentioned were infected  by\r\n\r\nthe  disease-carrying mosquitoes while at work  in\r\n\r\nthe hospital. It was also possible that they could\r\n\r\nhave  been so infected elsewhere. Although one  of\r\n\r\nthem  was living in the Housemen's Quarters within\r\n\r\nthe  Hospital grounds, the other was living in his\r\n\r\nown  home  in Katong. But the Hospital authorities\r\n\r\nhave  been  maintaining strict  vigilance  against\r\n\r\nmosquito  breeding. But whatever  effective  anti-mosquito  breeding measures are taken  within  the\r\n\r\ncompounds of the Hospital, mosquitoes could  still\r\n\r\ncome from outside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>NTUC CO-OPERATIVE SUPERMARKETS</b></div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>(Expansion of)</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance if he intends to encourage and assist  the\r\n\r\nNTUC  Welcome Consumers' Co-operative to establish\r\n\r\nmore  supermarkets in other parts of the  Republic\r\n\r\nin  order  to  curb unreasonable price  increases,\r\n\r\nespecially that of rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, the NTUC is to be congratulated  for\r\n\r\nits   initiative  in  setting  up  the  first  co-operative  supermarket, Welcome, in Toa  Payoh,  a\r\n\r\nchoice area for such an enterprise.

The modern trend  is  to  regard\r\n\r\nmental  illness in much the same light as physical\r\n\r\nillness  and  disability. The  provisions  in  the\r\n\r\nexisting  Act were laid down as far back as  1934,\r\n\r\nprobably modelled on the provisions of the  Mental\r\n\r\nTreatment  Act, 1930, of England and Wales.  These\r\n\r\nprovisions  were consolidated in the existing  Act\r\n\r\nin  1952. They are, therefore, very much outmoded.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emphasis in 1934 was on the compulsory\r\n\r\ndetention of persons of unsound mind. The main aim\r\n\r\nwas  to prevent such persons from causing harm  to\r\n\r\nthe community. The role of the mental hospital was\r\n\r\nmainly  confined  to  one  of  legal  custody  for\r\n\r\npersons of unsound mind. At that time there was no\r\n\r\neffective  or  simple treatment for  such  persons\r\n\r\nexcept  preventing  them from  causing  injury  to\r\n\r\nthemselves or other persons or damage to property.\r\n\r\nSince  1934 there have been revolutionary  changes\r\n\r\nand  discoveries in the treatment  of  persons  of\r\n\r\nunsound  mind.  The trend began with  the  use  of\r\n\r\nElectro-convulsive Therapy (1934),  the  discovery\r\n\r\nand  use  of psychotropic drugs (1957)  and  anti-depressive  drugs (1959) and outpatient treatment.\r\n\r\nAt  present,  the trend is towards community  care\r\n\r\nand this is provided for by the Mental Health Act,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1275</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1959,  of  England  and Wales  as  far  as  United\r\n\r\nKingdom is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal changes which this Bill seeks to\r\n\r\nbring about are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sections 31 to 34 relate to the types of\r\n\r\npersons who may be sent to the mental hospital for\r\n\r\nadmission  for  treatment.  Conspicuously  omitted\r\n\r\nfrom  the  amendments are the provisions  for  the\r\n\r\nreception  of  a mentally unsound  person  into  a\r\n\r\nmental  hospital  by  an  order  of  a  Court.  In\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  changed  attitude   towards\r\n\r\nmental  diseases, persons of unsound mind are  not\r\n\r\nregarded  as  \"criminals\".  The  person   can   be\r\n\r\nreceived  in a mental hospital, as any other  sick\r\n\r\nperson, if he comes voluntarily, if he is sent  by\r\n\r\na  medical  practitioner or if, being  of  unsound\r\n\r\nmind, he is considered a danger to himself and  to\r\n\r\nothers or is being neglected or cruelly treated by\r\n\r\nthose who should be responsible for his care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, section 31 is amended to enable\r\n\r\na  person  who requires treatment for  any  mental\r\n\r\ndisorder  to  be admitted to or to remain  in  any\r\n\r\nmental  hospital  without any order  or  directive\r\n\r\nrendering  him liable to be detained at  a  mental\r\n\r\nhospital.  At  present  admission  to  the  mental\r\n\r\nhospital  is  almost exclusively  by  a  detention\r\n\r\norder  made by a Court or a commitment  order  for\r\n\r\n\"observation\".  Both connote incarceration  rather\r\n\r\nthan treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 5, the new section 32 will enable\r\n\r\nand,  in  fact, require a police officer  who  has\r\n\r\napprehended  a  person who is reported  to  be  of\r\n\r\nunsound  mind  and  a danger to other  persons  to\r\n\r\nbring such person direct to a medical officer at a\r\n\r\nmental  hospital for examination. At  present  the\r\n\r\nprocedure  to admit such a person is unnecessarily\r\n\r\ninvolved. The police officer is required to  bring\r\n\r\nthe  person, first, to a medical officer  and  if,\r\n\r\nand  only if, the medical officer agrees, will  he\r\n\r\nbe  sent  to a mental hospital. In practice,  this\r\n\r\nstep has been found to be redundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall, however, be making a further amendment\r\n\r\nto this section in Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis  is  being  made  on the  suggestion  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Medical Association which has made  some\r\n\r\nrepresentations to me on the Bill since  the  last\r\n\r\nadjournment  of  Parliament. The  Association  had\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  there might be the  odd  occasion\r\n\r\nwhere the police, in apprehending a person who  is\r\n\r\nmentally ill and a danger to himself or to others,\r\n\r\nshould  have the discretion to take the person  to\r\n\r\nany medical officer first, instead of directly  to\r\n\r\na  medical officer in a mental hospital. While the\r\n\r\noccasion to take the person of unsound mind to any\r\n\r\nmedical  officer first, instead of directly  to  a\r\n\r\nmedical officer at a mental hospital, will be rare\r\n\r\nindeed,  the  flexibility nevertheless  should  be\r\n\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsections (1) and (3) of section 33 will also\r\n\r\nbe  re-amended by the amendments which I shall  be\r\n\r\nmoving  in Committee. This section refers  to  the\r\n\r\ncase  where a person of unsound mind is  neglected\r\n\r\nor  cruelly  treated. It provides  the  Magistrate\r\n\r\nwith  powers  to  require  the  persons  who  have\r\n\r\nresponsibility  for  their  care  to  produce  the\r\n\r\nperson  of  unsound mind or to require the  police\r\n\r\nofficer  to  check  on such a report.  If  in  his\r\n\r\nenquiries  the  Magistrate has reason  to  believe\r\n\r\nthat  such  a mentally ill person is indeed  being\r\n\r\nill-treated or neglected, he can refer the  person\r\n\r\nto a mental hospital for treatment and care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magistrate has powers under this section to\r\n\r\nimpose   penalties   on  the   persons   who   are\r\n\r\nresponsible for the care of the person of  unsound\r\n\r\nmind,  if  they fail to comply with the  order  to\r\n\r\nproduce the person for examination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Singapore Medical Association has\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  the  penalty  imposed  should  be\r\n\r\nextended to charge the persons responsible for the\r\n\r\nperson  of  unsound  mind for  all  medical  costs\r\n\r\narising  from the care of the person in  a  mental\r\n\r\ninstitution. The motivation behind the  suggestion\r\n\r\nis  understandable.  But the  practical  realities\r\n\r\nwould  render the provision a dead letter. If  the\r\n\r\nrelatives or persons responsible for the  care  of\r\n\r\nthe  person of unsound mind are already  negligent\r\n\r\nin  the  care  of the person, it will be  unlikely\r\n\r\nthat  any  order made for the cost of the person's\r\n\r\nmaintenance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nin   a   mental  hospital  would  be  implemented.\r\n\r\nFurther,  any  such  order to  pay  the  Costs  of\r\n\r\nmaintenance  is an open-ended one as the  person's\r\n\r\nstay   in   the  mental  hospital  could   go   on\r\n\r\nindefinitely. It is for these reasons that I  have\r\n\r\nnot  accepted the recommendations of the Singapore\r\n\r\nMedical Association on this section.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 34 provides for the reference by any\r\n\r\nregistered  practitioner of a  person  of  unsound\r\n\r\nmind to a mental hospital. This provision is found\r\n\r\nin  the old Act. The Singapore Medical Association\r\n\r\nhad  made  a recommendation on this provision.  It\r\n\r\nrecommended that it should be provided that in the\r\n\r\nevent  of  a  person  whom  a  registered  medical\r\n\r\npractitioner believes to be of unsound mind as  to\r\n\r\nrequire  psychiatric treatment and who refuses  to\r\n\r\ngo  for treatment, the registered practitioner can\r\n\r\nrequest and the police officer will have a duty to\r\n\r\ntake  such person to a mental hospital. I  do  not\r\n\r\nagree to this suggestion. This is because a person\r\n\r\nwho  is merely suspected to be mentally ill should\r\n\r\nnot  be  subject to coercion and the indignity  of\r\n\r\nbeing  taken  to a mental hospital by  force.  The\r\n\r\ntype of conditions requiring psychiatric treatment\r\n\r\nrange  from  the  mild  psychogenic  headache  and\r\n\r\nfainting attacks to overt insanity. It would be  a\r\n\r\nbreach  of  a person's civil rights for  a  police\r\n\r\nofficer to send, for example, a person who  has  a\r\n\r\nmild  psychiatric illness to a mental hospital  if\r\n\r\nhe  refuses  to do so. Such a person can  exercise\r\n\r\njudgement  whether or not he wishes  to  be  under\r\n\r\ntreatment  in  a  mental hospital and  the  police\r\n\r\nshould  not  be  made party to force  him  to  get\r\n\r\ntreatment  against  his  wishes.  This  is   quite\r\n\r\ndifferent from the case where the person may be  a\r\n\r\ndanger to himself as in attempting suicide,  or  a\r\n\r\ndanger  to  others  and  causing  destruction   to\r\n\r\nproperty. Under these circumstances, it  is  right\r\n\r\nand  proper for the police to apprehend the person\r\n\r\nand  take him to a mental hospital. This  duty  is\r\n\r\nprovided under section 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised provisions are made in section 35 under\r\n\r\nclause 5 laying down procedures which are intended\r\n\r\nto  ensure  that  no  person is  detained  in  the\r\n\r\nhospital\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfor  any  period longer than is necessary for  his\r\n\r\ntreatment. After examination by a medical officer,\r\n\r\na  person  can be initially detained for 72  hours\r\n\r\nfor  treatment. Before the expiry of this  period,\r\n\r\nanother  medical officer must examine the  patient\r\n\r\nand,   if  he  is  of  the  opinion  that  further\r\n\r\ntreatment in the hospital is required, he may sign\r\n\r\nan  order  detaining  the patient  for  a  further\r\n\r\nperiod  up to one month. Before the month  is  up,\r\n\r\ntwo  medical  officers (one of whom  is  to  be  a\r\n\r\npsychiatrist)  will  be required  to  examine  the\r\n\r\npatient   separately.  If  both  medical  officers\r\n\r\nconsider   that   the  patient  requires   further\r\n\r\ntreatment  as  an inpatient, they  must  sign  two\r\n\r\nseparate orders which will allow the patient to be\r\n\r\ndetained in the hospital for a further period  but\r\n\r\nnot  exceeding 12 months. After the expiration  of\r\n\r\n12  months, if the patient should be detained  for\r\n\r\nfurther  treatment, then the order  for  detention\r\n\r\nmust be made by a Magistrate on the application of\r\n\r\nthe visitors of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Medical Association had made some\r\n\r\nsuggestions   on  this  section.  The  suggestions\r\n\r\nproposed   were   generally  for  more   stringent\r\n\r\nprovisions  under which the extension  orders  for\r\n\r\ncommitment  to a mental hospital are  made.  Thus,\r\n\r\nfor  the  initial  commitment  of  72  hours,  the\r\n\r\nAssociation proposed that the order be made by two\r\n\r\nmedical  officers, one of whom may be a registered\r\n\r\nmedical  practitioner. The first  extension  order\r\n\r\nextending  to  one  month  must  be  signed  by  a\r\n\r\npsychiatrist,  not  a  medical  officer,  and  the\r\n\r\nsecond extension order up to one year to be signed\r\n\r\nby  two  medical officers, as presently  provided,\r\n\r\nbut  the  difference being that  one  of  the  two\r\n\r\nmedical   officers   should  be   a   psychiatrist\r\n\r\ndifferent from the first psychiatrist who  ordered\r\n\r\nthe extention of the commitment by one month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered the proposals carefully to see\r\n\r\nif there might be any merit from the view-point of\r\n\r\nsafeguards  over  the present amendments.  I  have\r\n\r\ncome  to  the  conclusion  that  it  will  not  be\r\n\r\nnecessary   to  provide  for  the  more  stringent\r\n\r\nprovisions  proposed by the Association.  For  one\r\n\r\nthing,  they are not realistic, nor do  they  take\r\n\r\ninto account\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  organisation of the mental hospital. It  must\r\n\r\nbe  remembered that a person coming to the  mental\r\n\r\nhospital  may do so at any time of the day  or  at\r\n\r\nnight  when there is only a single medical officer\r\n\r\non duty. It would be impractical if the person who\r\n\r\nneeds   urgent   admission  cannot   be   admitted\r\n\r\nimmediately   merely  because  a  second   medical\r\n\r\nofficer  is not available. Even under the existing\r\n\r\nAct,  only  a single medical officer's  commitment\r\n\r\norder  is  required for initial commitment.  There\r\n\r\nhas  been no occasion where it has been found that\r\n\r\nthis provision has been abused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To require the extension order of one month to\r\n\r\nbe   signed  by  psychiatrists  would  be   merely\r\n\r\nrequiring    a   statutory   function    on    the\r\n\r\npsychiatrists in the service adding to  the  paper\r\n\r\nwork,  without any advantage. The medical officers\r\n\r\nin   the   hospital   work  directly   under   the\r\n\r\npsychiatrists. Patients admitted will certainly be\r\n\r\nbrought to the attention of the psychiatrists  and\r\n\r\nif  a  person requires extended treatment, it will\r\n\r\nalso   certainly   be  with  the   cognizance   or\r\n\r\ninstructions  of  the  psychiatrist.  The  medical\r\n\r\nofficer  on  his own would not sign the  extension\r\n\r\norder  without first having ascertained the  views\r\n\r\nand obtained the approval of the psychiatrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there are adequate safeguards in the\r\n\r\nAct against wrongful detention: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Board of Visitors have a duty (under\r\n\r\nsection 30) to check on every person who has  been\r\n\r\nadmitted to the hospital.

Not once has it been necessary\r\n\r\nfor  the  Board  of  Visitors  to  object  to  the\r\n\r\ncommitment of any of the persons admitted  to  the\r\n\r\nhospital  and  not once has it been  necessary  to\r\n\r\ntake   action   against  persons  for   improperly\r\n\r\ncommitting a person to the mental hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further protection against wrongful detention is\r\n\r\naccorded the patient by the provisions of  section\r\n\r\n36  of clause 5 which prohibit any medical officer\r\n\r\nfrom  signing  any order under the Act  who  is  a\r\n\r\nrelative (defined in detail in that section)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nor who stands in any fiduciary relationship to the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 37 in clause 5, the Medical\r\n\r\nSuperintendent  or a psychiatrist  at  the  mental\r\n\r\nhospital  will be empowered to order the discharge\r\n\r\nof  a  patient. It has been found that in a number\r\n\r\nof  cases,  it  would be in the  interest  of  the\r\n\r\npatient to be treated as an outpatient rather than\r\n\r\nan  inpatient  of the hospital, so that  he  could\r\n\r\nlive  in an environment which is conducive to  his\r\n\r\nrecovery. Under the existing law, the discharge of\r\n\r\na person committed to the hospital can be effected\r\n\r\nonly  by  a  Court Order in the case of  a  person\r\n\r\nadmitted  by Court Order, and in all other  cases,\r\n\r\nby   a   Board   of   Visitors  or   the   Medical\r\n\r\nSuperintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to some minor re-amendments\r\n\r\nwhich  I  shall be moving in Committee. Section  2\r\n\r\nrefers  to  the definition of a psychiatrist.  The\r\n\r\ndefinition  has  been reworded  to  make  it  more\r\n\r\nprecise.  This was made at the suggestion  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore   Medical  Association;  the   operative\r\n\r\nwording  being that a psychiatrist is one who  has\r\n\r\nexperience  and holds qualifications in psychiatry\r\n\r\nwhich  are  approved  by the Director  of  Medical\r\n\r\nServices. In the original amendment, the reference\r\n\r\nto  psychiatry  has been left  out  and  it  might\r\n\r\npresumably  be  conceived  that  the  psychiatrist\r\n\r\ncould  merely,  on  approval of  the  Director  of\r\n\r\nMedical Services, be any medical practitioner  who\r\n\r\nis acceptable to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has stated in his speech that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"in a number of cases, it would be in the\r\n\r\ninterest of the patient to be treated as  an  out-patient  rather than an inpatient of the hospital,\r\n\r\nso  that he could live in an environment which  is\r\n\r\nmore conducive to his recovery\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>While I have no doubt that some patients are  best\r\n\r\ntreated  as outpatients, in practice I wonder  how\r\n\r\nthorough  is  the  investigation  into  the   home\r\n\r\nenvironment   of   a  patient,  particularly   the\r\n\r\nfinancial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nposition of the family concerned, in deciding upon\r\n\r\nthe desirability of outpatient treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the course of my work on the ground, I\r\n\r\nhave  come  across a number of cases of  complaint\r\n\r\nfrom  families that they are unable to look  after\r\n\r\nthe   patients,  and  that  they  would  like  the\r\n\r\npatients  to be detained for a longer period;  but\r\n\r\nthe  mental hospital invariably is quite reluctant\r\n\r\nto  do  so. There was at least one case I know  of\r\n\r\nwhere  the parent of a patient came to me  with  a\r\n\r\nvery badly damaged head. In another case, after  a\r\n\r\npatient  was  released and  sent  home  the  whole\r\n\r\nfamily  could not get any sleep for nights because\r\n\r\nhe  threatened to burn down the house.  These  are\r\n\r\ntwo  of  the several cases which I have  received.\r\n\r\nGenerally  a family would come along and  complain\r\n\r\nthat  as  soon as a patient was brought  home,  he\r\n\r\nwould suffer a relapse, or that his condition  was\r\n\r\nno  better  than when he was first  put  into  the\r\n\r\nmental hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of investigating into the family\r\n\r\nbackground  as  to  whether the family  adequately\r\n\r\nunderstand  the  circumstances of caring  for  the\r\n\r\npatient  or  whether  they are  financially  able,\r\n\r\nshould  be  looked into very carefully. I  suspect\r\n\r\nthat it is rather a question of lack of facilities\r\n\r\nat  the  mental hospital that causes many patients\r\n\r\nto  be  treated as outpatients. Perhaps we  should\r\n\r\nseriously think of expanding the facilities at the\r\n\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this point\r\n\r\nthat I have put forward, that mental patients  can\r\n\r\nrecover  better if they are gradually returned  to\r\n\r\ntheir  own home environment where there is  family\r\n\r\ncare and family love, is a modern trend. From  the\r\n\r\nmedical point of view, it is a sound one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has brought up some\r\n\r\nproblems,  such  as  the family  not  being  in  a\r\n\r\nfinancial position to maintain the member  of  the\r\n\r\nfamily  who is a mental patient or that the family\r\n\r\nis   quite  reluctant  to  take  on  their  social\r\n\r\nresponsibility of trying to rehabilitate a  member\r\n\r\nof  their family. Of course, before releasing  the\r\n\r\npatient, we do send our social workers to go and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ninvestigate the family background, and so on.  But\r\n\r\nthis  responsibility cuts both  ways.  The  public\r\n\r\nshould  realise that they just cannot dump on  the\r\n\r\nlap  of the Government to take care of everything.\r\n\r\nThat  should not be the attitude. They  must  also\r\n\r\nplay their part. It is a matter of the doctors  on\r\n\r\nthe  one side and the members of the family on the\r\n\r\nother, or the social workers coming in between, to\r\n\r\nsee  that  these mental patients are brought  back\r\n\r\nslowly  into the home environment. It is  all  for\r\n\r\nthe  benefit of the patients. But, of course,  you\r\n\r\ndo find families who are psychologically averse to\r\n\r\ntaking back a person whom they thought is not in a\r\n\r\nsound  state  of  mind.  If  they  adopt  such  an\r\n\r\nattitude,  of  course,  the  patient  will   never\r\n\r\nrecover.  These are the odd cases that  have  come\r\n\r\nup.  My  report  is that quite a great  number  of\r\n\r\nthose  patients who have been brought  back  to  a\r\n\r\nhome  environment have recovered. But, of  course,\r\n\r\nthe  odd  cases will always come up. When they  do\r\n\r\ncome  up, Members of Parliament may have  to  deal\r\n\r\nwith  them.  And in dealing with them,  they  will\r\n\r\nhave to put their problems to me, as far as mental\r\n\r\ncases are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the facilities at the hospital,\r\n\r\nmay  I say that, as I have announced in an earlier\r\n\r\nsitting,  we are establishing a half-way  home  in\r\n\r\nSembawang  for the slow rehabilitation  of  mental\r\n\r\npatients. I think this will meet the problem which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Jalan Kayu has posed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do agree\r\n\r\nthat it is the social responsibility of the family\r\n\r\nto try to help in the recovery of the patient.

Until the arrival  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore scene of an international company  known\r\n\r\nas  Holiday Magic, this practice was comparatively\r\n\r\nunknown  in  Singapore,  though  the  practice  is\r\n\r\nwidespread and has expanded enormously  in  recent\r\n\r\nyears  in  certain western countries such  as  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States  of America, Canada, South  Africa,\r\n\r\nAustralia  and the United Kingdom. Some  of  these\r\n\r\ncountries have taken steps to ban pyramid selling;\r\n\r\nothers  have attempted to control or regulate  it,\r\n\r\nbut with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has already clearly indicated its\r\n\r\nattitude  to  the practice of pyramid  selling  by\r\n\r\ntaking action in the High Court in April this year\r\n\r\nto  wind  up,  on grounds of public interest,  the\r\n\r\ncompany  known as Holiday Magic which  carried  on\r\n\r\npyramid  selling  of cosmetics in  Singapore.  But\r\n\r\npetitioning the High Court for a winding up  order\r\n\r\nof a company is a lengthy and time-consuming\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nprocedure. In the result it is  a  poor\r\n\r\nsubstitute to the expression of condemnation  that\r\n\r\nis  inherent in an Act of Parliament that  outlaws\r\n\r\nin  plain terms this trading practice and makes it\r\n\r\na  criminal  offence for any person to promote  or\r\n\r\nparticipate in such practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential features of pyramid selling are by\r\n\r\nnow  well  known to Members. In general terms,  it\r\n\r\nmay  be  described  as  a  scheme  or  arrangement\r\n\r\nrelating  to  the  sale of goods or  provision  of\r\n\r\nservices  under  which  the participants  pay  for\r\n\r\ntheir rights under the scheme and receive a reward\r\n\r\nfor  recruiting new participants. Taken  together,\r\n\r\nthese  two  factors  lead  to  expansion  of  such\r\n\r\nschemes on the chain-letter principle. This may be\r\n\r\nbetter  understood if I explain how these  schemes\r\n\r\nwork. In a typical pyramid scheme for the sale  of\r\n\r\ngoods, a company sells and the participants buy  a\r\n\r\nright  to sell its goods. Legally the participants\r\n\r\nare  usually  regarded as independent  contractors\r\n\r\nwho  buy for resale the goods from the company  or\r\n\r\nfrom other participants at a discount on the price\r\n\r\nto   the  consumer.  The  participants  are  often\r\n\r\ndescribed  as  franchise  holders.  The   original\r\n\r\nfranchise  holders,  as  well  as  selling   goods\r\n\r\nthemselves  to  the public, will  recruit  further\r\n\r\nparticipants to whom they will sell the goods  for\r\n\r\nresale  to the public and, in some cases,  to  yet\r\n\r\nanother  level  of participants. In  this  way,  a\r\n\r\nhierarchy  is built up, each receiving a  discount\r\n\r\nfrom  the  consumer's price on the goods he  buys,\r\n\r\nthe size of the discount depending on his position\r\n\r\nin   the  hierarchy.  Hence,  the  terms  \"pyramid\r\n\r\nselling\" and \"multi-level marketing\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all but the lowest level in the structure,\r\n\r\nthe   franchise  holders  receive  a  payment  for\r\n\r\nrecruiting   new  participants.  This   leads   to\r\n\r\nexpansion  on  the chain-letter principle.  A  new\r\n\r\nfranchise holder pays immediately a sum of  money;\r\n\r\nthe  amount of the payment being determined by the\r\n\r\nlevel  at which he wishes to join the scheme.  For\r\n\r\nthis  outlay the franchise holder usually receives\r\n\r\nsome  goods or credit for goods and some  training\r\n\r\nin addition to his other rights under the schemes.\r\n\r\nThus, at the higher levels the franchise holder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncan  earn  money in two ways; first, by profit  on\r\n\r\nsales  he  makes himself and often by a commission\r\n\r\non  sales  by  those on his part of  the  pyramid;\r\n\r\nsecondly,   from   payments  for  recruiting   new\r\n\r\nparticipants (from the new recruits). Those at the\r\n\r\nlowest  level of the pyramid form the bulk of  the\r\n\r\nsales  force: they are usually recruited  to  sell\r\n\r\nthe  products at the lowest rate of commission  to\r\n\r\nthe public. The company running the scheme has two\r\n\r\nmain  sources of income: the sale of its goods  or\r\n\r\nservices   to   the  franchise  holders,   and   a\r\n\r\nproportion   of   the   payments   made   by   new\r\n\r\nparticipants or by existing participants when they\r\n\r\nbuy their way into a higher level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The franchise holder suffers a number of\r\n\r\ndisadvantages under these pyramid selling schemes,\r\n\r\nincluding the following. He does not usually  have\r\n\r\nexclusive  rights to sell in a defined  territory.\r\n\r\nGoods  and services are difficult to sell  because\r\n\r\nthe rewards for recruiting far exceed those to  be\r\n\r\nearned  from  selling  and  because  the  discount\r\n\r\nstructure  of  pyramid  selling  makes  the  goods\r\n\r\nexpensive  by  the time they reach  the  customer.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the goods are rarely advertised. Since\r\n\r\nthe  higher  level  franchise  holder  can  seldom\r\n\r\nrecoup  the  investment by selling  goods,  he  is\r\n\r\noften  driven to terminate the contract  and  seek\r\n\r\nrepayment  from the company or to concentrate  his\r\n\r\nefforts   on  earning  a  return  from  recruiting\r\n\r\nothers.  The conditions of the contract  are  such\r\n\r\nthat  it  is impossible on termination to  recover\r\n\r\nany  part  of  the  investment  from  the  company\r\n\r\nexcept, perhaps, repayment for unsold goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High pressure salesmanship by the pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  companies' representatives gloss over  or\r\n\r\nconceal  these inherent disadvantages but  at  the\r\n\r\nsame  time  stress  the high  rewards  (which  are\r\n\r\nmostly  illusory) available to a franchise holder.\r\n\r\nLittle  or  no information is provided  about  the\r\n\r\ncompany's  assets,  turnover, capacity  to  supply\r\n\r\ngoods,  demand  for products,  or  the  number  of\r\n\r\nfranchise  holders recruited or to  be  recruited.\r\n\r\nRecruits   are,  furthermore,  put   under   heavy\r\n\r\npressure  by  the  selling or advertising  tactics\r\n\r\nadopted by the promoters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  sign  a  contract and little or no opportunity\r\n\r\ngiven   to   them  to  rescind  if,   on   further\r\n\r\nreflection, they should wish to do so.  Since  the\r\n\r\npromoters  rarely have a big stake in the  scheme,\r\n\r\nthe major part of the risks are taken by franchise\r\n\r\nholders  at  different levels in the  scheme.  The\r\n\r\nchief   attraction   of  the  scheme   for   these\r\n\r\ncompanies,  apart from this, is  that  capital  is\r\n\r\nmade   available  cheaply  and  quickly  and   the\r\n\r\nfranchise  holders  are left with  the  burden  of\r\n\r\nholding and disposing of the stocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result has been that countless franchise\r\n\r\nholders  in  the  countries I have mentioned  have\r\n\r\nover  the  years  suffered considerable  financial\r\n\r\nloss  and hardship by being lured into these \"get-rich-quick\" schemes. The Government is  determined\r\n\r\nthat  this sort of situation should not be allowed\r\n\r\nto  develop  in Singapore. Thus, the  decision  to\r\n\r\nlegislate to outlaw the practice before it becomes\r\n\r\nwidespread  and before members of the public  here\r\n\r\nare  induced to part with their savings on a large\r\n\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, after a close study of the\r\n\r\noperations  of  these pyramid selling  schemes  in\r\n\r\nSingapore   and  elsewhere,  has   come   to   the\r\n\r\nconclusion   that  the  undesirable  features   of\r\n\r\npyramid  selling  are so clearly contrary  to  the\r\n\r\npublic  interest that the objective should  be  to\r\n\r\neliminate  them  rather than  attempt  to  control\r\n\r\nthem.  We  have  no doubt in our  minds  that  the\r\n\r\nobjectionable features of a pyramid selling scheme\r\n\r\nto   which  I  have  referred  are  tainted   with\r\n\r\ndishonesty  and  are  potentially  fraudulent   in\r\n\r\nintent. But having said that, I should add that it\r\n\r\nwould  be  extremely difficult to prove dishonesty\r\n\r\nor  fraud  in  relation to these  pyramid  selling\r\n\r\nschemes  under the existing general principles  of\r\n\r\nour  criminal  and civil law. New provisions  are,\r\n\r\ntherefore,  essential  to deal  specifically  with\r\n\r\nthis practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill accordingly makes it unlawful\r\n\r\nfor  any  person  to promote or participate  in  a\r\n\r\nmulti-level marketing scheme or arrangement or  to\r\n\r\nhold out that he is promoting or participating  in\r\n\r\nsuch a scheme or arrangement.

Existing\r\n\r\ncompanies   that   promote  such   a   scheme   or\r\n\r\narrangement must within sixty days of  the  coming\r\n\r\ninto  operation  of this Act take  steps  to  wind\r\n\r\nthemselves up voluntarily or petition the court to\r\n\r\nwind  up the companies concerned. If they fail  to\r\n\r\ntake  or  complete  the  necessary  steps  to  get\r\n\r\nthemselves  wound up, the Minister  has  power  to\r\n\r\npetition the court to wind them up compulsorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is confidently expected that these proposed\r\n\r\nmeasures, once they are translated into law,  will\r\n\r\nbe  effective  to  eliminate  pyramid  selling  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. However, it should be pointed out  that\r\n\r\nit  is  not  the intention of this Bill to  outlaw\r\n\r\nschemes  or arrangements which do not contain  the\r\n\r\nobjectionable elements that I have referred to. It\r\n\r\nis   recognised   that  there   are   systems   of\r\n\r\nfranchising  (including  perhaps  sub-franchising)\r\n\r\nand  direct  selling  which  are  not  necessarily\r\n\r\nobjectionable  and  which  should  be  allowed  to\r\n\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a legislative and drafting aspect, it is by\r\n\r\nno  means  easy  to  distinguish  clearly  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  schemes  from those other  systems  which\r\n\r\nsometimes  have  a pyramid element  in  them.  The\r\n\r\nquestion of definition, therefore, assumes primary\r\n\r\nimportance  in  this  Bill. The  definition  of  a\r\n\r\npyramid  selling scheme or arrangement  should  be\r\n\r\none  that  is  easily understood  and  capable  of\r\n\r\neffective  application and be  so  drafted  as  to\r\n\r\npinpoint   the   objectionable  elements   earlier\r\n\r\nmentioned.  It should not, however, be  so  widely\r\n\r\ndrafted  as  to prevent development  of  perfectly\r\n\r\nlawful  schemes  and arrangements.  Provision  has\r\n\r\naccordingly been inserted in clause 11 of the Bill\r\n\r\nfor  the Minister by regulations to spell out  the\r\n\r\nelements  of a scheme or arrangement that  may  he\r\n\r\nlawfully\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noperated  in  Singapore. Although  these  elements\r\n\r\nhave not as yet been comprehensively worked out by\r\n\r\nthe Attorney-General, it is envisaged that schemes\r\n\r\nof  franchise  trading where the franchise  holder\r\n\r\ndoes  not  recruit  others  and  sells  goods   or\r\n\r\nprovides  a  service from one  level  and  from  a\r\n\r\nretail  establishment will not  be  objectionable.\r\n\r\nAgain,   schemes  of  direct  selling  where   the\r\n\r\ncompany's main source of income is from  the  sale\r\n\r\nof  goods  and services rather than from  payments\r\n\r\nfor   recruiting  others  and  where  the  company\r\n\r\nsubscribes  to  a code of conduct  and  where  the\r\n\r\nfranchise  holders are agents of the company  (not\r\n\r\nindependent  contractors) and work  in  a  defined\r\n\r\ngeographic area, etc., will not be objectionable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of a \"pyramid selling scheme or\r\n\r\narrangement\"   in  section  2  is   not   intended\r\n\r\naccordingly to interfere with these other  schemes\r\n\r\nor  arrangements  to  which I have  referred.  The\r\n\r\ndefinition adopted will ensure that recruitment of\r\n\r\nparticipants  in pyramid selling  schemes  on  the\r\n\r\nchain-letter  principle will be prevented  for  it\r\n\r\nwould  be impossible to take or make payments  for\r\n\r\nrights in such a scheme or arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill summarises\r\n\r\nthe   objects   and   reasons  of   the   proposed\r\n\r\nlegislation,  and I need not elaborate  upon  them\r\n\r\nfurther  except  to draw attention  to  clause  10\r\n\r\nwhich  makes  it clear that sales to consumers  of\r\n\r\ncommodities received by the seller under a pyramid\r\n\r\nselling  scheme,  the promotion of  which  becomes\r\n\r\nunlawful  under the Bill, are not declared  to  be\r\n\r\nunlawful if the commodities were received  by  the\r\n\r\nseller  at  any  time before the  Act  comes  into\r\n\r\noperation.  The  purpose of this provision  is  to\r\n\r\nconfer  a  limited  measure  of  protection   upon\r\n\r\nexisting   franchise  holders  who  have   already\r\n\r\nparticipated in an unlawful scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>COMPANIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.49 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill which seeks to amend the Companies Act\r\n\r\nmay, in certain of its provisions, be regarded  as\r\n\r\nan  extension of the philosophy that is  basic  to\r\n\r\nthe  Securities Industry Act. That is to say, that\r\n\r\nin  great  measure  this Bill  is  concerned  with\r\n\r\nmatters involving the protection of investors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision has also been made in clause 4, which\r\n\r\namends  section  39, for the Registrar  to  exempt\r\n\r\ncompanies from compliance with any requirements of\r\n\r\nthe  Act  relating to the form and  content  of  a\r\n\r\nprospectus if, in his opinion, compliance would be\r\n\r\nunduly  burdensome. This amendment is intended  to\r\n\r\nmake   it   easier  for  foreign  companies   with\r\n\r\ninnumerable  subsidiaries to seek listing  on  the\r\n\r\nSingapore Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions that appear in clauses 9, 10, 11\r\n\r\nand  15  are in one way or another concerned  with\r\n\r\ndealing  in  securities by  officers,  agents  and\r\n\r\nemployees   of  a  company,  with  disclosure   of\r\n\r\nshareholdings  held  by  directors  or  with   the\r\n\r\nextension  of  powers to ascertain the  beneficial\r\n\r\nownership  of securities where, for example,  such\r\n\r\nsecurities are held in nominee names. They are, in\r\n\r\nshort,  designed to ensure that persons, by reason\r\n\r\nof  their  position  in  a company,  do  not  take\r\n\r\nadvantage of confidential knowledge of the affairs\r\n\r\nof  a  company by buying or selling the shares  of\r\n\r\ntheir  companies for their own profit or for other\r\n\r\npersons'   profit  and  to  the  disadvantage   of\r\n\r\nshareholders or investors generally, and to ensure\r\n\r\nthat  these persons make full disclosure of  their\r\n\r\nshareholdings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concepts involve not only the dishonest form\r\n\r\nof share trading known as insider trading but also\r\n\r\nthe  duty  of  directors of a company  to  make  a\r\n\r\ngeneral disclosure of their shareholdings so  that\r\n\r\nthe   investing  public  are  aware  of  what  the\r\n\r\nmanagers of a company are doing with their  shares\r\n\r\nin the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to insider trading -which may\r\n\r\nloosely  be  said  to be the use  of  confidential\r\n\r\ninformation before a rise or even a fall in  price\r\n\r\nof  a  share or stock - the existing section  132A\r\n\r\nhas  been  considerably expanded in  clause  9  to\r\n\r\ncover  not  only the dishonest use of confidential\r\n\r\ninformation  by  officers of a company  (including\r\n\r\ndirectors)  for their own financial  advantage  or\r\n\r\nthat  of  other persons but also of  agents  of  a\r\n\r\ncompany (such as bankers, auditors, solicitors  or\r\n\r\nstockbrokers) and employees similarly misuse  such\r\n\r\nconfidential  information for their own  financial\r\n\r\nadvantage  or  that  of  other  persons.   Equally\r\n\r\nsignificant,   this  concept   that   appears   in\r\n\r\nsubsection (1) of section 132A extends to apply to\r\n\r\ndishonest use of confidential information by  such\r\n\r\npersons to gain advantage for themselves or  other\r\n\r\npersons  where there is a possibility of  a  take-over  offer being made to another corporation,  or\r\n\r\nwhere   there  is  possibility  of  a  substantial\r\n\r\ncommercial  transaction being  entered  into  with\r\n\r\nanother  corporation by dealing in the  securities\r\n\r\nof that other corporation on a stock exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the Minister has power under\r\n\r\nsubsection  (7), for the protection of  investors,\r\n\r\nto  restrict  dealings  in  the  securities  of  a\r\n\r\ncorporation  by an officer, agent or  employee  of\r\n\r\nthat  corporation  during  certain  periods  of  a\r\n\r\nfinancial year of a corporation when such  persons\r\n\r\nare,  or  are likely to be, in possession of  what\r\n\r\nmay    be    called   privileged   price-sensitive\r\n\r\ninformation regarding a company's securities.  The\r\n\r\nMinister  under  this section may  also  direct  a\r\n\r\ncommittee of a stock exchange or the committee may\r\n\r\nof  its  own  motion investigate any  dealings  in\r\n\r\nsecurities and for this purpose may summon persons\r\n\r\nto give evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis power taken together with the powers that may\r\n\r\nbe delegated by the Minister under section 208 (by\r\n\r\nclause  15)  will enable a committee  of  a  stock\r\n\r\nexchange to get behind nominee holdings, which  is\r\n\r\none  of  the  methods used by insiders to  acquire\r\n\r\nlarge  and  secret holdings in a company  that  is\r\n\r\nlikely to be made the target of a take-over bid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we have attempted to make insider trading\r\n\r\na  specific criminal offence, it would be rash  to\r\n\r\nclaim that the section covers all forms of insider\r\n\r\ntrading  or that a successful prosecution  can  be\r\n\r\nlaunched  in every case where insider  trading  is\r\n\r\nsuspected. The section does not, for example, deal\r\n\r\nwith a situation where information is acquired  by\r\n\r\nthird persons by improper or dishonest means, such\r\n\r\nas  the bugging of company discussions. But it  is\r\n\r\nnot  to  be  thought  that such  persons  can  use\r\n\r\ninformation  acquired in this way  with  impunity.\r\n\r\nThey  could  still  be  caught  in  the  catch-all\r\n\r\nprovision (section 87) of the Securities  Industry\r\n\r\nAct  which is drafted in the widest possible terms\r\n\r\nto  deal with all forms of fraud or deceit used in\r\n\r\nthe  purchase or sale of securities. A prosecution\r\n\r\nfor  insider trading could he launched under  that\r\n\r\nsection    against   any   person   who    misuses\r\n\r\nconfidential  information.  However,  it  is   not\r\n\r\nintended    that   persons   who   have   acquired\r\n\r\ninformation  in a perfectly proper and  legitimate\r\n\r\nmanner   and  who  are  not  insiders  should   be\r\n\r\npenalized  under  either of these offence-creating\r\n\r\nsections.  But  it  is the intention  that  if  an\r\n\r\ninsider  deliberately benefits an outsider through\r\n\r\nthe  misuse  of  his confidential information,  he\r\n\r\nwill  be liable under the provisions as if he  had\r\n\r\nreceived the outsider's benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are additional problems of definition in\r\n\r\nthe section which are extremely difficult to cover\r\n\r\nwith any degree of precision. For example, an area\r\n\r\nof uncertainty inevitably arises by the use of the\r\n\r\nwords  \"affect materially the price of the subject\r\n\r\nmatter  of  the  dealing on a stock  exchange\"  in\r\n\r\nrelation to the non-disclosure of the confidential\r\n\r\ninformation.  Such problems will necessarily  have\r\n\r\nto  be left to a court to decide, having regard to\r\n\r\nthe particular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumstances of the case. Again, the  section  is\r\n\r\nlimited  to dealings in securities with an insider\r\n\r\non  a  stock  exchange  and  does  not  extend  to\r\n\r\ndealings  in securities that take place outside  a\r\n\r\nstock  exchange. Experience in the application  of\r\n\r\nthis   provision   will   tell   whether   further\r\n\r\namendments  to  this provision  are  going  to  be\r\n\r\nnecessary. Since the proposed new section  extends\r\n\r\nto  employees  of a company, it is doubtful  if  a\r\n\r\ncompany  will be able to tell its staff  that  the\r\n\r\nforthcoming company results are going to be  good;\r\n\r\nagain where staff purchase options in shares,  the\r\n\r\ntime when these options are exercised could create\r\n\r\ndifficulties,  though the Minister could  in  this\r\n\r\nlatter respect exempt such dealings in regulations\r\n\r\nmade under subsection (7) of new section 132A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these and other purely drafting\r\n\r\nproblems, the Government is determined to  provide\r\n\r\nand   enforce  a  legislative  framework   whereby\r\n\r\ninsider traders can be brought to book for  it  is\r\n\r\nnow  generally agreed that this dishonest form  of\r\n\r\ntrading is just as reprehensible as other forms of\r\n\r\ndishonest trading which are punishable under  Part\r\n\r\nX of the Securities Industry Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the provisions in the keeping of\r\n\r\na  register of directors' share-holdings  and  the\r\n\r\ngeneral  duty  of directors to make disclosure  of\r\n\r\ntheir holdings that are at present provided for in\r\n\r\nsection 134 of the Act, these provisions have been\r\n\r\nsubstantially  redrafted. The effect  of  the  new\r\n\r\nsection is to oblige a director to make disclosure\r\n\r\nto  the  company  not only of the details  of  his\r\n\r\nshareholdings    but    also    debentures     and\r\n\r\nparticipatory  interests,  rights,   options   and\r\n\r\ncontracts  to  which he is a party,  and  for  the\r\n\r\ncompany to enter into its registers, amongst other\r\n\r\nthings, the price and the date of the transaction.\r\n\r\nThese  details must be entered by the  company  in\r\n\r\nits register within three days of receiving notice\r\n\r\nfrom  a  director. The Registrar has the right  to\r\n\r\nrequire the company to submit to him a copy of the\r\n\r\nregister or any part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining provisions are much the same as in\r\n\r\nthe existing section except\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat the penalty for default has been considerably\r\n\r\nincreased.  The  new section  135  is  related  to\r\n\r\nsection  134 and obliges directors to comply  with\r\n\r\nthe  latter  section and also  to  advise  of  any\r\n\r\nchange  in the particulars of his holdings  within\r\n\r\n24 hours of the change. A company, however, has  a\r\n\r\nperiod of seven days within which to advise  other\r\n\r\ndirectors of the company of events occurring under\r\n\r\nsubsection  (1). Certain defences to a prosecution\r\n\r\nunder this section are made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 13 the intention is, as mentioned in\r\n\r\nthe  Explanatory  Statement,  to  spell  out  with\r\n\r\ngreater  particularity what  are  the  powers  and\r\n\r\nduties  of  auditors  of companies  in  regard  to\r\n\r\nreports or accounts and consolidated accounts. His\r\n\r\nduties  are now put in a more positive  form;  for\r\n\r\nexample, he must now form an opinion as to whether\r\n\r\nhe   has   obtained   all  the   information   and\r\n\r\nexplanations that he required rather than,  as  in\r\n\r\nthe  existing provision, state in his report  that\r\n\r\nhe  has  not  obtained  all  the  information  and\r\n\r\nexplanations  required.  Furthermore,  if  he   is\r\n\r\nsatisfied  that  there has been a breach  or  non-observance  of any provision of the Act,  and  the\r\n\r\nmatter  has  not  been or will not  be  adequately\r\n\r\ndealt  with in his report on the accounts  or  the\r\n\r\nconsolidated accounts or by bringing  this  matter\r\n\r\nto   the  attention  of  the  directors,  he  must\r\n\r\nforthwith  report  the matter in  writing  to  the\r\n\r\nRegistrar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that an auditor may fearlessly and\r\n\r\nconscientiously carry out his duties  as  auditor,\r\n\r\nby  a  new section 174A, he is not, in the absence\r\n\r\nof  malice,  liable in any action for  defamation.\r\n\r\nNeither  shall  any other person  be  liable  who,\r\n\r\nwithout  notice, publishes a document prepared  by\r\n\r\nan  auditor  in  the  course  of  his  duties  and\r\n\r\nrequired to be lodged with the Registrar.\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next significant feature of the Bill appears\r\n\r\nin clause 14 which amends section 179 dealing with\r\n\r\ntake-overs  and mergers. In July of 1971,  Members\r\n\r\nmight  recall  that I indicated in a statement  in\r\n\r\nParliament  that  a study would  be  made  of  the\r\n\r\nLondon  City  Panel  and Code  on  Take-overs  and\r\n\r\nMergers to ascertain if a similar non-statutory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nscheme  would  be  suitable  and  appropriate  for\r\n\r\nintroduction   into  Singapore,   either   as   an\r\n\r\nalternative  or supplemental means of  controlling\r\n\r\ntake-overs  and  mergers.  I  shall  reserve   for\r\n\r\nanother occasion a statement on the nature of  the\r\n\r\nCode  and  the  principal functions of  any  body,\r\n\r\npanel  or  committee,  and  the  constitution   of\r\n\r\nmembership  thereof  that  may  be   set   up   to\r\n\r\nadminister  the  Code. On this  occasion  I  shall\r\n\r\nconfine  myself to giving brief reasons, based  on\r\n\r\nadvice  tendered to me by the Securities  Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil,  why  the non-statutory  Code  should  be\r\n\r\nadopted  in Singapore in addition to the statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions dealing with take-overs and mergers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great advantage of a non-statutory Code is\r\n\r\nits  flexibility, a very necessary attribute  when\r\n\r\none  is  laying  down in effect  what  amounts  to\r\n\r\nbusiness  standards of behaviour in take-over  and\r\n\r\nmerger  situations rather than the laying down  of\r\n\r\nstrict  legal  rules. Such a Code can  be  amended\r\n\r\neasily  to  deal  with new situations  that  might\r\n\r\narise  or to revise existing concepts that  appear\r\n\r\nin  the  Code.  Again,  the creation  of  a  body,\r\n\r\ncommittee  or  panel, to supervise and  administer\r\n\r\ntake-overs  and mergers that consists  of  persons\r\n\r\nwho  are  conversant  with  the  workings  of  the\r\n\r\nsecurities market, ensures that the experience and\r\n\r\nexpertise of those persons can be utilised in  and\r\n\r\nbrought  to  bear  upon  this  complex  field   of\r\n\r\nbusiness. But more than anything else there is the\r\n\r\nconsideration   that   our   existing    statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions, standing by themselves, are inadequate\r\n\r\nto  deal with the many problems likely to arise in\r\n\r\ntake-over and merger situations. Although it would\r\n\r\nnot  be difficult to expand the existing statutory\r\n\r\nprovisions   to  ensure  greater  disclosure   and\r\n\r\nequality of treatment of shareholders and  so  on,\r\n\r\nthe   statutory   provisions   would   still    be\r\n\r\nunsatisfactory  for, by their very rigidity,  they\r\n\r\nmilitate   against  the  prompt  and   expeditious\r\n\r\nsettlement of take-over problems and can never  be\r\n\r\ndetailed  enough  to cover the wide  diversity  of\r\n\r\ntake-over  techniques, bid  tactics,  patterns  of\r\n\r\nshare ownership and control,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  consideration offered, and so  on,  that  may\r\n\r\noccur from time to time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inevitable delay in seeking amendments to\r\n\r\nstatutory  provisions by way of an  amending  Bill\r\n\r\nwith  the  difficulties that this may cause  to  a\r\n\r\npending  takeover should also be borne in mind.  A\r\n\r\nmore practical consideration is that, owing to the\r\n\r\nserious  shortage of qualified and  trained  staff\r\n\r\npossessing  the  appropriate  expertise   in   the\r\n\r\nRegistry  of  Companies, it is not at the  present\r\n\r\ntime  possible for this department effectively  to\r\n\r\nadminister and supervise take-overs under a purely\r\n\r\nstatutory  scheme.  It would be some  considerable\r\n\r\ntime  before  persons of the right calibre  become\r\n\r\navailable and, even then, it is doubtful  if  they\r\n\r\ncould have the same amount of expertise in matters\r\n\r\nconnected  with the securities industry  that  one\r\n\r\nwould  expect to find and utilize in  the  private\r\n\r\nsector.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these brief reasons, it is considered that a\r\n\r\nsupplemental non-statutory Code is likely to be  a\r\n\r\nmore   efficient   and   expeditious   method   of\r\n\r\nadministering   and  controlling  take-overs   and\r\n\r\nmergers  than non-statutory provisions.  I  should\r\n\r\nadd,  at  this  point, that if this  amendment  is\r\n\r\npassed   and   a  body,  panel  or  committee   is\r\n\r\nconstituted to administer a non-statutory Code, it\r\n\r\nis envisaged that, unlike the existing London City\r\n\r\nCode, the powers conferred upon such administering\r\n\r\nauthority  would be much greater than is conferred\r\n\r\nupon its London counterpart. These powers would be\r\n\r\nconferred under the Securities Industry Act and in\r\n\r\nthe  provisions  of  this Bill. The  administering\r\n\r\nauthority would still, as in London, however, have\r\n\r\nconsultative and supervisory functions. It is also\r\n\r\nimportant   to  mention  that  this  administering\r\n\r\nauthority  would  work  very  closely   with   the\r\n\r\nQuotation  Section  of  the Stock  Exchange  which\r\n\r\nwould  retain many of its existing functions  with\r\n\r\nregard  to  companies concerned in take-overs  and\r\n\r\nmergers. The Quotation Section would, for example,\r\n\r\nsatisfy  itself that the offer documents meet  the\r\n\r\nrequirements of the Code. It will, of  course,  be\r\n\r\nnecessary  for  the  Stock Exchange  Rules  to  be\r\n\r\nconsiderably  expanded in regard to  its  takeover\r\n\r\nand merger rules, and the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommittee  of the Stock Exchange are looking  into\r\n\r\nthis matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the result, section 179 has been amended to\r\n\r\nenable  the Minister, in subsection (11)  thereof,\r\n\r\nfor the more effective administration, supervision\r\n\r\nand  control of take-overs and mergers, to  direct\r\n\r\nby  notice  if  he considers it necessary  in  the\r\n\r\npublic interest or for the protection of investors\r\n\r\nthat   all  parties  in  a  take-over  and  merger\r\n\r\ntransaction shall, in addition to compliance  with\r\n\r\nthe  Tenth  Schedule, be bound to  abide  by  such\r\n\r\ngeneral  principles and rules of  a  non-statutory\r\n\r\nnature   as   he  may  determine;  these   general\r\n\r\nprinciples and rules would be administered by such\r\n\r\nbody,  panel  or  committee as  the  Minister  may\r\n\r\nspecify in the notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Minister decides to take action under\r\n\r\nthis  provision,  it is envisaged  that  he  would\r\n\r\ndirect that provisions similar to the London  City\r\n\r\nCode on Take-overs and Mergers would be binding on\r\n\r\nall  parties  to take-over and merger transactions\r\n\r\nwith,  of  course,  such modification  as  may  be\r\n\r\nnecessary   to   adopt   this   Code   to    local\r\n\r\ncircumstances. It is also envisaged  that  such  a\r\n\r\nSingapore Code would be administered and  enforced\r\n\r\nby the Securities Industry Council, the membership\r\n\r\nof  which would be enlarged to include a number of\r\n\r\nmerchant  bankers  experienced in  take-overs  and\r\n\r\nmergers.  In  actual practice, it is thought  that\r\n\r\nthe Securities Industry Council would create a sub-committee  to  handle the take-overs  and  mergers\r\n\r\naspect  of the Securities Industry Council and  to\r\n\r\nreport  its  decision  to the Securities  Industry\r\n\r\nCouncil for consideration and approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendment to section 179 will ensure\r\n\r\nthat  the  body, panel or committee (in fact,  the\r\n\r\nSecurities Industry Council) that will be  dealing\r\n\r\nwith takeovers and mergers will receive copies  of\r\n\r\nall the notices and statements referred to in that\r\n\r\nsection. Subsection (10) at present provides  that\r\n\r\nsuch notices and statements should be sent only to\r\n\r\nthe  Registrar or a Stock Exchange.  Members  will\r\n\r\nalso note the amendment made to the Tenth Schedule\r\n\r\nwhich also concerns take-overs and mergers (clause\r\n\r\n21).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the amendments to section 208\r\n\r\n(clause  15)  is  principally  to  confer  upon  a\r\n\r\ncommittee  of a stock exchange, with the  approval\r\n\r\nof  the  Minister, to make its own enquiries  into\r\n\r\nnominee  holdings. The nominee  system  does  have\r\n\r\ncertain advantages, namely, banks sometimes prefer\r\n\r\nto  have complete control over shares lodged  with\r\n\r\nthem as security and therefore register the shares\r\n\r\nin  their names; investment managers can buy large\r\n\r\nblocks of shares in nominee names rather than many\r\n\r\nsmall  blocks  in  many  names.  Again,  if  large\r\n\r\ninvestors are making substantial investments in  a\r\n\r\nparticular company, they might not wish it  to  be\r\n\r\ngenerally   known  since  this   could   have   an\r\n\r\nexaggerated  effect  on the market  price  of  the\r\n\r\ncompany  concerned; certain investors do not  want\r\n\r\nto  be  troubled  personally with offer  documents\r\n\r\ncollecting  dividends and so on, and  leave  these\r\n\r\nthings  to professional advisers acting in nominee\r\n\r\nnames.  But  these have to be weighed against  the\r\n\r\ndisadvantage  that  nominee holdings  conceal  the\r\n\r\nbuildup  of very substantial holdings in a company\r\n\r\nand   are  sometimes  used  to  conceal  dishonest\r\n\r\ninsider dealings. While it is not intended at  the\r\n\r\npresent  time to abolish nominee holdings,  it  is\r\n\r\nthe  intention that greater use will in future  be\r\n\r\nmade of section 208 to investigate these holdings.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,   the  whole  subject   of   nominee\r\n\r\nholdings  will be reviewed at a suitable  time  by\r\n\r\nthe Securities Industry Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in clauses 16 and 17,\r\n\r\nwhich  amend sections 217 and 218 respectively  of\r\n\r\nthe Companies Act, enable the Minister to petition\r\n\r\nthe   court  in  certain  circumstances  for   the\r\n\r\ncompulsory winding up of companies that  carry  on\r\n\r\nthe  business of multi-level marketing or  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling.  The  proposed amendments are,  in  fact,\r\n\r\nrelated  to the Bill which has been considered  by\r\n\r\nMembers  and  which  is designed  to  ban  pyramid\r\n\r\nselling in Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final significant feature of this Bill is\r\n\r\nconcerned with investment companies and  is  dealt\r\n\r\nwith  in  clause  18. Members will  see  from  the\r\n\r\nExplanatory  Statement  what  the  effect  of  the\r\n\r\namendments would be to Division I of Part XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI  need  not  enlarge upon this  explanation.  The\r\n\r\npurpose of all the amendments proposed is to relax\r\n\r\nthe  rigour  of some of the existing  restrictions\r\n\r\nwith  regard to the powers of investment companies\r\n\r\nto  borrow,  to invest in other companies  and  to\r\n\r\nunderwrite  securities, and  to  relieve  them  of\r\n\r\ncertain  obligations with regard to  the  articles\r\n\r\nand prospectuses and particulars to be attached to\r\n\r\nbalance  sheets. Only one investment  company  has\r\n\r\nbeen  proclaimed  as such up to the  present  time\r\n\r\nbut,  with  the  development  of  Singapore  as  a\r\n\r\nfinancial and investment centre, more applications\r\n\r\nwill  be  received from companies to be proclaimed\r\n\r\nunder subsection (2) of section 319.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.16 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker, Sir, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now\r\n\r\nread a Second time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are aware that our Securities Industry\r\n\r\nAct  was drafted on the basis that a common  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  between  Singapore  and  Malaysia  would\r\n\r\ncontinue to exist. Certain provisions of this Act,\r\n\r\naccordingly, gave legislative recognition  to  the\r\n\r\nexistence  of  the  joint Malaysia  and  Singapore\r\n\r\nStock  Exchange.  The decision  of  the  Malaysian\r\n\r\nGovernment to discontinue the joint Stock Exchange\r\n\r\nand    to   operate   its   own   stock   exchange\r\n\r\nindependently  has, therefore,  radically  altered\r\n\r\nthe  existing  legislative position.  One  of  the\r\n\r\nimmediate consequences of this decision  has  been\r\n\r\nthat Singapore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwas  obliged  to  create its  own  separate  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  and, as we all now know, this new  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange is called the Stock Exchange of Singapore\r\n\r\nLtd.  The  former joint Stock Exchange of Malaysia\r\n\r\nand Singapore is in the process of being dissolved\r\n\r\nand   no   longer  operates  a  stock  market   in\r\n\r\nSingapore.  The only stock market in existence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore  is  the  stock  market  of  the   Stock\r\n\r\nExchange of Singapore Ltd. This Stock Exchange has\r\n\r\nbeen  approved  by  me  under  section  6  of  the\r\n\r\nprincipal  Act.  With all these  developments,  it\r\n\r\nwill   be  readily  appreciated  by  Members  that\r\n\r\namendments  will need to be made to the  principal\r\n\r\nAct  to  bring  the  Act into line  with  the  new\r\n\r\nfactual situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement explains the nature of\r\n\r\nthe  amendments  that  arc proposed.  I  need  not\r\n\r\nelaborate  upon them except to say that  with  the\r\n\r\nrepeal  of  section  98  of  the  Act  legislative\r\n\r\nrecognition will no longer be given to the  former\r\n\r\njoint  Stock  Exchange of Malaysia and  Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe  new Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd, will now\r\n\r\noperate independently with its own Rules, Bye-laws\r\n\r\nand  Listing  Requirements. Members of  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  of Singapore will henceforth  deal  with\r\n\r\nmembers of the Stock Exchange of Malaysia  in  the\r\n\r\nsame  way  as they deal with members of any  other\r\n\r\nforeign  stock  exchange,  whether  they  are   in\r\n\r\nLondon, Hongkong or elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dissolution of the joint Stock Exchange has\r\n\r\nnot,  up  to the present time, materially affected\r\n\r\nthe  total number of companies quoted on  the  new\r\n\r\nSingapore  Stock  Exchange. From  this  total  the\r\n\r\nSingapore registered companies number 76  and  the\r\n\r\nMalaysian  companies number 154.  The  balance  is\r\n\r\nmade  up  of  45  companies  registered  overseas,\r\n\r\nmainly  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  may  he  of\r\n\r\ninterest to Members to learn that during 1972 (and\r\n\r\nthe  previous years of 1970 and 1971 were not  all\r\n\r\nthat different), of the total turnover of units on\r\n\r\nthe former joint Stock Exchange something like  60\r\n\r\nper cent to 70 per cent of this total turnover was\r\n\r\nattributable    to   Singapore    share    dealing\r\n\r\ntransactions,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthough  I  should stress that it is difficult  for\r\n\r\ntechnical  reasons to be precise as to  the  exact\r\n\r\ncontribution  to total turnover made by  Singapore\r\n\r\nand Malaysia. It is, however, true to say that the\r\n\r\ngreater  part of the total turnover  of  units  is\r\n\r\nover  the  last few years attributable to dealings\r\n\r\nin  Singapore. Again, the total paid-up capital of\r\n\r\nthe  Singapore registered companies  in  1972  was\r\n\r\n$1,275  million compared with Malaysian  companies\r\n\r\nwhich   was  $1,460  million,  and  total   market\r\n\r\ncapitalisation for Singapore quoted  companies  is\r\n\r\napproximately  50  per cent higher  than  that  of\r\n\r\nMalaysian quoted companies. The turnover value  of\r\n\r\nshares  of Singapore quoted companies in 1972  was\r\n\r\napproximately three times higher than in Malaysia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for dealers in securities, there are 17\r\n\r\nmember-companies and one member-firm consisting in\r\n\r\nthe aggregate of 63 stockbrokers - the member-firm\r\n\r\nreferred  to  will  in the next twelve  months  be\r\n\r\nconverting    itself   into   a    member-company.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,    there    are     277     dealers'\r\n\r\nrepresentatives (formerly described as dealers and\r\n\r\nremisiers). Both these factors, that  is  to  say,\r\n\r\nthe  number  of  companies  quoted  on  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange  and the number of brokers operating  are\r\n\r\nrelevant in relation to the viability of  a  stock\r\n\r\nmarket  as, of course, are the number of investors\r\n\r\nand  share traders who are prepared to risk  their\r\n\r\nmonies at any particular time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Singapore Government's point of view,\r\n\r\nit  would  welcome the continuance of the  present\r\n\r\nposition  whereby  Malaysia  registered  companies\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be quoted on the Stock  Exchange  of\r\n\r\nSingapore. But even if it should come to pass that\r\n\r\nsome  of  these  companies,  for  one  reason   or\r\n\r\nanother,  cease to be quoted here there  are  good\r\n\r\ngrounds  for  believing that the  Singapore  Stock\r\n\r\nmarket  would be a viable one. In this connection,\r\n\r\nI  should  mention that ii is the  policy  of  the\r\n\r\nGovernment and of the Stock Exchange to  encourage\r\n\r\nthe  listing of new companies that come up to  the\r\n\r\nstandards  for  listing laid  down  by  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange and the Securities\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndustry Council. This policy will extend not only\r\n\r\nto  local  companies  but  also  to  companies  of\r\n\r\ninternational standing that are registered outside\r\n\r\nSingapore that wish to have a listing on our Stock\r\n\r\nExchange.  Conversely, subject to guidelines  laid\r\n\r\ndown by the Securities Industry Council, Singapore\r\n\r\ncompanies  will  not be discouraged  from  seeking\r\n\r\nlistings on foreign exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this does not disguise the fact that the\r\n\r\ncreation of a separate Stock Exchange in Singapore\r\n\r\nhas   created  teething  problems  for  the  Stock\r\n\r\nExchange   Committee.   Many   of   the    initial\r\n\r\ndifficulties   brought   about   by   the   sudden\r\n\r\ntransition  to  a  separate Stock  Exchange  have,\r\n\r\nhowever,  I  am  glad  to say,  been  successfully\r\n\r\novercome.  The  Committee  has  faced  up  to  its\r\n\r\nproblems  in  an  energetic and business-like  way\r\n\r\nwhich  augurs well for the future of the new Stock\r\n\r\nExchange. The Committee has brought out New  Rules\r\n\r\nfor the Exchange which are a great improvement  on\r\n\r\nthe  old Rules. These Rules take into account  the\r\n\r\nprovisions  of the principal Act which affect  the\r\n\r\nExchange  and its members. The Committee has  also\r\n\r\npublished  in booklet form its policy with  regard\r\n\r\nto corporate disclosure. Since this policy is very\r\n\r\nmuch concerned with the maintenance of a sound and\r\n\r\nhealthy   market  and  with  fair   treatment   to\r\n\r\ninvestors,  the  Government  expects  all   listed\r\n\r\ncompanies to comply with the new policy. They must\r\n\r\nalso   pay  strict  regard  to  the  new   Listing\r\n\r\nRequirements  that  have  been  prepared  by   the\r\n\r\nExchange  and  sign  without delay  the  necessary\r\n\r\nundertaking to be bound thereby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence, therefore, of adverse factors\r\n\r\nthat  cannot at present be anticipated, we can,  I\r\n\r\nventure to say, look forward in the years ahead to\r\n\r\nincreasing growth of this Exchange. In the context\r\n\r\nof  Singapore's development as a financial centre,\r\n\r\nit would not, I think, be over-sanguine to predict\r\n\r\nthat  the Stock Exchange will assume much  greater\r\n\r\nimportance  than hitherto, both from a  local  and\r\n\r\ninternational point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed\r\n\r\nto a Committee of the whole House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a\r\n\r\nCommittee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without\r\n\r\namendment; read a Third time and passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"That Parliament do now adjourn to a date to be\r\n\r\nfixed.\" - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Thirty-one</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">minutes past Four o'clock p.m. to</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">a date to be fixed.</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
