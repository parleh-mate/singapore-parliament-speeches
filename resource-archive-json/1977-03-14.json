In  the  case  of   confirmed\r\n\r\nofficers,  the reports are put up annually while  for\r\n\r\nprobationers,   they   are  done   six-monthly.   The\r\n\r\nperformance  of  an  officer reported  on  is  graded\r\n\r\naccording to a number of attributes relevant  to  his\r\n\r\nwork.  Such  an  assessment is usually  made  by  the\r\n\r\nofficer's  immediate  supervisor  and  subject  to  a\r\n\r\nsecond  opinion  of a Countersigning Officer  who  is\r\n\r\nusually   the  superior  of  the  Reporting  Officer.\r\n\r\nThrough this, a fairly reasonable assessment  of  the\r\n\r\nperformance of an officer is made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the present Staff Confidential Report Form\r\n\r\nfor  Divisions I and II officers in the Civil Service\r\n\r\nis designed for the assessment of officers performing\r\n\r\nadministrative  and managerial duties.  It  does  not\r\n\r\nprovide  a  very  accurate  assessment  of  those  in\r\n\r\nprofessional   grades  where  the  emphasis   is   on\r\n\r\nprofessional    capabilities    rather    than     on\r\n\r\nadministrative skills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Management Services Department of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Finance  has  invited Permanent  Secretaries  and\r\n\r\nHeads  of  major  Departments who  have  professional\r\n\r\nofficers  to  make  proposals on  how  the  reporting\r\n\r\nsystem  can  be  improved.

I also wish to point out  that  some\r\n\r\ncould  have failed to take the oath deliberately  for\r\n\r\nvarious  reasons, such as to evade national  service.\r\n\r\nIn  1976,  24 of the 67 who failed to take  the  oath\r\n\r\nwere known to have done so deliberately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not practical to send individual reminders to\r\n\r\nminors  about the need to take the oath because  many\r\n\r\nof  them were registered as Singapore citizens  at  a\r\n\r\ntender age, often below one year old, and it would be\r\n\r\nextremely   difficult  to  contact   these   persons,\r\n\r\nparticularly if they are residing overseas and do not\r\n\r\npossess  Singapore identity cards. Even if  reminders\r\n\r\nwere  to  be sent, those who failed to take the  oath\r\n\r\ncould  always  claim that they did  not  receive  the\r\n\r\nreminders  and  thus put the blame on the  Government\r\n\r\nfor their own failing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the following measures have been\r\n\r\ntaken  all  along by the Registry of  Citizenship  to\r\n\r\nremind   minor   citizens  to  take   the   oath   of\r\n\r\nrenunciation, allegiance and loyalty on reaching  the\r\n\r\nage of 21:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) A reminder on the need for the oath taking, in\r\n\r\nthe  four official languages, is stamped on the  back\r\n\r\nof  all  citizenship  certificates  issued  to  minor\r\n\r\ncitizens;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) At the time such certificates are issued, the\r\n\r\nattention of the parent or guardian is drawn  to  the\r\n\r\noath taking requirement;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Singapore passports, both international and\r\n\r\nrestricted, issued to minor citizens are  valid  only\r\n\r\nup  to  their 21st birthday and will not  be  renewed\r\n\r\nunless the holders have taken the oath;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) Since July 1973, a press statement has been\r\n\r\nissued  bi-annually  in June and December  to  remind\r\n\r\nminor citizens to take\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  oath.

If they fail to do\r\n\r\nso,  they have themselves to blame. I might add  that\r\n\r\ncitizenship  is a serious matter for the  minors  and\r\n\r\ntheir  parents  to make the effort on their  part  to\r\n\r\nremember to take their oath. If they do not, it is an\r\n\r\nindication  that  they  do not  seriously  value  the\r\n\r\ncitizenship or treat their oath of allegiance to  our\r\n\r\nRepublic seriously. They have one full year in  which\r\n\r\nto take their oath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Dr Lau Teik Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lau Teik Soon (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  the Minister mentioned that in 1976 out of  the\r\n\r\nnumber  who  failed to take the oath  of  allegiance,\r\n\r\nabout 34 of them had reapplied.

I would now like to continue with my speech\r\n\r\nwhich was interrupted at the adjournment last Friday.\r\n\r\nI was saying that Singapore has been transformed into\r\n\r\na  productive industrial country providing employment\r\n\r\nfor  the  greater part of our population. This  shows\r\n\r\nthat  our  economy  is  on the way  to  recovery.  On\r\n\r\nindustrial training, the Minister pointed out that at\r\n\r\nthe  end  of  last  year there were  8,483  full-time\r\n\r\nstudents  and  3,373 part-time students  enrolled  in\r\n\r\nITB's training courses. There was also an increase in\r\n\r\nthe  number of trainees trained under the various EDB\r\n\r\ntraining  schemes. The training included  mechanical,\r\n\r\nelectrical and electronic courses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf   course,   all  these  technical  and  mechanical\r\n\r\ntraining  courses are necessary. If the  courses  are\r\n\r\nconducted  properly new blood will be  injected  into\r\n\r\nour     industrial    technical     reservoir     for\r\n\r\nindustrialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I have heard of certain adverse reports on\r\n\r\nsuch  training  schemes.  For  example,  there  is  a\r\n\r\nshortage of instructors and that the contents of  the\r\n\r\ncourses are not very relevant to actual needs.  I  do\r\n\r\nnot  know  whether there is any truth in the rumours.\r\n\r\nBut  since  the Government has spent a lot of  money,\r\n\r\nmanpower  and resources on these training schemes.  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to ask whether such schemes have  reaped\r\n\r\nfavourable  results  where  the  trainees  have  been\r\n\r\ndeployed  in  our industries and whether  the  skills\r\n\r\nhave  been  put  to  proper use,  otherwise  what  is\r\n\r\nlearned  is  of no practical use and is  a  waste  of\r\n\r\npublic   funds.  Another  question  is  whether   the\r\n\r\ntraining  institutes  keep  a  record  of  employment\r\n\r\nstatistics  of  those  trainees  relevant  to   their\r\n\r\nskills. I would like the Minister to inform the House\r\n\r\nof the situation in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Industrial Development, the Minister said that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Large unused production capacity and high\r\n\r\nunemployment in the industrialised countries no doubt\r\n\r\naffected  the drop in new investments from  overseas.\r\n\r\nThe  task of investment promotion for the coming year\r\n\r\nremains difficult.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Such  analysis  is quite correct. The  Minister  also\r\n\r\nlaid emphasis on promotion efforts to be made in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States. Japan and Western Europe. This  shows\r\n\r\nthat the Government is quite determined in developing\r\n\r\nour  economy. Of course, in order to further  develop\r\n\r\nour  economy, we should have political stability  and\r\n\r\nharmonious  industrial  relations  which  will  bring\r\n\r\nabout a suitable investment climate. Apart from this,\r\n\r\nwe  should  also formulate more favourable terms  for\r\n\r\ninvestment  to attract investors from Southeast  Asia\r\n\r\nand other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to review our incentive measures.\r\n\r\nFor  example, there is the stipulation that  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  who  have  resided in Singapore  for  five\r\n\r\nyears will be entitled to apply for citizenship. But,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naccording to my knowledge, not many foreign investors\r\n\r\nhave  obtained citizenship. This would give  rise  to\r\n\r\ndoubts  among  the foreign investors  and  shake  the\r\n\r\nconfidence  of  would-be investors.  My  question  is\r\n\r\nwhether the Minister is aware of the manner in  which\r\n\r\napplications for citizenship by such people are dealt\r\n\r\nwith  and whether the incentive measures are properly\r\n\r\ncarried  out  by  the  proper  authorities.  Has  the\r\n\r\nRegistry of Citizenship considered the policy that we\r\n\r\nshould  give incentives and encouragement to  attract\r\n\r\nforeign  investors? I reckon the Minister for Finance\r\n\r\nshould  be  concerned about this matter. In addition,\r\n\r\nwhen foreign investors want to purchase properties or\r\n\r\nsend  their children to school, or have other  needs,\r\n\r\ndo  we  make it easy for them to do so? I think these\r\n\r\nare   important  factors  that  will  induce  foreign\r\n\r\ninvestors  to come and invest here. Though these  are\r\n\r\nmatters  of  detail  to  be  carried  out  by   civil\r\n\r\nservants. I hope the Minister will see to it that our\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  do  not tarnish the  good  image  of\r\n\r\nSingapore as a centre for investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister in the past few years has on several\r\n\r\noccasions emphasised the need for diversification  in\r\n\r\nour  economy  in  order to overcome problems  due  to\r\n\r\neconomic  recession.  Such a  statement  is  correct.\r\n\r\nHowever,  apart  from industrial diversification,  we\r\n\r\nshould  also not neglect the development  in  farming\r\n\r\nand fishery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is that in the Budget statement,\r\n\r\naccording to the Minister, there is a drop of 20%  in\r\n\r\nthe  private building industry. This is  due  to  the\r\n\r\ncompletion of office blocks and shopping centres  and\r\n\r\nthe  slump  in  industrial building and the  shipyard\r\n\r\ninvestment. There is a drop of 3% in private housing.\r\n\r\nWhat  are  the causes? In the beginning of 1970,  the\r\n\r\nprivate  building sector had experienced a period  of\r\n\r\nprosperity and had played quite an important role  in\r\n\r\nour  economic development. However, in the  last  few\r\n\r\nyears there has been a slump in this sector. What are\r\n\r\nthe reasons? I think the Minister should instruct the\r\n\r\nrelevant  authorities to get to  the  bottom  of  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  such  slump  in  the  private  building\r\n\r\nindustry so as to find a remedy for such\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndefects,  and  in  order to resuscitate  the  private\r\n\r\nbuilding  industry  to continue contributing  towards\r\n\r\nour plural economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the farming industry, for example, the growing\r\n\r\nof  orchids and rearing of tropical fish,  which  are\r\n\r\ntwo big foreign exchange earners, however, I have not\r\n\r\nseen  any effort being made by the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  to  assist these two industries.  What  I\r\n\r\nmean is that the Primary Production Department should\r\n\r\ngive  them  greater assistance and encouragement  and\r\n\r\nthat there should be a liaison between the Department\r\n\r\nand  the  two  industries to study and plan  for  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of these two industries and to allot more\r\n\r\nland  to  enable them to expand and earn more foreign\r\n\r\nexchange for our Republic. We should not leave  these\r\n\r\ntwo  industries to struggle and fend for  themselves.\r\n\r\nIf  Members of Parliament in this House were to raise\r\n\r\nsuch  a question, the Minister concerned would always\r\n\r\nsay,  \"These are excellent suggestions and  that  the\r\n\r\nMinistry  will consider such suggestions\",  but  what\r\n\r\nhas  been the outcome? Nothing has been done. Is this\r\n\r\ncorrect? Our country is an insular one, surrounded by\r\n\r\nsea.  I  believe there is potentiality for developing\r\n\r\nour  marine  fishing  industry.  For  example,  large\r\n\r\nquantities of fish, prawns and crabs can be reared in\r\n\r\nour numerous islands. If the fishermen have an outlet\r\n\r\nin  employment, they will not be obliged to resort to\r\n\r\nhawking  as a means of livelihood. Many kelongs  have\r\n\r\nbeen  abolished. So these people were forced to  take\r\n\r\nup  hawking.  Therefore, the development  of  fishery\r\n\r\nwill  save us tens of millions of dollars in  foreign\r\n\r\nexchange. So, why not develop it. What is the answer?\r\n\r\nI would like the Minister to tell this House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the four tax concessions mentioned in the\r\n\r\nBudget    statement   will   benefit   many   people,\r\n\r\nparticularly the first two tax concessions, i.e, the\r\n\r\nincrease  in the exemption of tax on estate duty  and\r\n\r\nthe  reduction  of  tax on resident pensioners.  This\r\n\r\ngoes to show that the Government has the interest  of\r\n\r\nthe  middle and lower income groups of the people  at\r\n\r\nheart. These measures are laudable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Economic Development, the Minister has put\r\n\r\nforward  positive plans. For example,  there  is  the\r\n\r\nfurther  strengthening of economic cooperation  among\r\n\r\nthe  Asian  countries, further  effort  in  promoting\r\n\r\ninternational  trade  and  further  effort  to   make\r\n\r\nSingapore  an  international financial centre.  These\r\n\r\nare  all constructive and practical measures and  are\r\n\r\ngood guidelines for the development of our economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, the Budget before the House is a body\r\n\r\nof  economic policies imbued with foresight and depth\r\n\r\nand  is well defined. I agree with the Minister  when\r\n\r\nhe  says  the weather ahead is fine and the  Ship  of\r\n\r\nState  is  in  good  shape. As  long  as  the  people\r\n\r\ncontinue  to  be  hardworking  and  self-reliant  and\r\n\r\ncooperate  closely with the Government, our  Ship  of\r\n\r\nState will sail forward smoothly and steadily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to support the Motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong (Marine Parade):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir, I rise to speak with some trepidation,\r\n\r\nas  not only do I stand the risk of being bruised  by\r\n\r\nsuperior counter fire power, but also the possibility\r\n\r\nof  being  ruled  out  of order for  repetition!  But\r\n\r\nconscience speaks louder than fear and it shall be my\r\n\r\nguide.  I  am going to speak on a subject  which  has\r\n\r\nbeen  raised by several Members and commented  on  by\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance during the debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address a few weeks ago, as I  feel  that\r\n\r\nthe  argument  did  not thrust deep  enough  and  the\r\n\r\nanswer offered did not parry the attack sufficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some of my colleagues in this House have\r\n\r\nargued  for an increase in personal and earned income\r\n\r\nreliefs  from  income  tax on  the  ground  that  the\r\n\r\nquantum  of  reliefs  was fixed about  30  years  ago\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  cost of living has risen  significantly\r\n\r\nsince  then,  particularly over the last  few  years.\r\n\r\nThis  argument  was basically sound but  it  was  not\r\n\r\ncarried  far enough. The Minister for Finance  warded\r\n\r\noff  this  argument  by saying that  an  increase  of\r\n\r\n$1,000  in  personal reliefs would  mean  a  loss  in\r\n\r\nGovernment revenue of some $26 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  a narrowing of the tax base, i.e, the number  of\r\n\r\npeople  paying  income tax. This line of  defence  is\r\n\r\ncorrect but not impregnable. He also added that while\r\n\r\nthe cost of living has gone up, so has the per capita\r\n\r\nincome which increases the ability of the taxpayer to\r\n\r\npay income tax. But is this really so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us take the $26 million potential loss.\r\n\r\n$26  million  is a lot of money from an  individual's\r\n\r\nviewpoint,  but  what  is  its  significance  to  the\r\n\r\nGovernment?  Income tax expected to be  collected  in\r\n\r\nthe  fiscal  year 1977 amounts to $1.38 billion,  and\r\n\r\n$26  million is only 1.9% of this. But if  we  relate\r\n\r\nthe  $26 million to income collected from individuals\r\n\r\nonly, and not companies, the percentage will probably\r\n\r\ngo  up  to  about  8-10%.  This  is,  of  course,   a\r\n\r\nsignificant percentage. The Minister, therefore,  has\r\n\r\na good defence here, but only fairly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the shrinkage of the tax base, I agree it is\r\n\r\nsalutary  for the population to be reminded that  the\r\n\r\nservices provided by the Government must be paid for.\r\n\r\nBut  I  would  simply ask at this stage  whether  the\r\n\r\naffected  taxpayers at the lower income scale  should\r\n\r\nbe  paying  tax in the first place! The  answer  will\r\n\r\ndepend on whether their real income has actually gone\r\n\r\nup  since  the  time  when  the  present  quantum  of\r\n\r\npersonal reliefs was originally worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said my colleagues' argument did not cut\r\n\r\ndeep  enough,  I did not mean to be disrespectful.  I\r\n\r\nwas  simply  having in mind their not quantifying  an\r\n\r\nargument  which could be quantified. Now I have  done\r\n\r\nthis, and it shows some disturbing results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we are discussing income tax, the relevant\r\n\r\nmeasure for inflation is the Consumer Price Index and\r\n\r\nnot the Gross Domestic Product deflator. The Consumer\r\n\r\nPrice Index as at December 1976 was 144.9, down  from\r\n\r\na  peak  of 150 in February 1975. Its base period  is\r\n\r\nNovember  1972.  By coincidence, the  National  Wages\r\n\r\nCouncil  made  its first promulgation  in  1972.  The\r\n\r\nrecommended  wage  increase  of  8%  for  that  year.\r\n\r\nhowever, will be ignored by us in our calculations so\r\n\r\nthat we have a common base\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nyear  of  1972. In 1973 the NWC award was  9%,  with\r\n\r\ncertain offsettings. In 1974, the recommended  annual\r\n\r\nincrement  was $40 plus 6% pIus annual  increment  or\r\n\r\n$40  plus 10% for those without annual increment. Let\r\n\r\nus  assume an average increase of 15% for that  year.\r\n\r\nto be on the generous side. In 1975 the NWC increment\r\n\r\nwas  6%  and  in 1976 7%. The employee's  salary  is,\r\n\r\ntherefore, being raised by 42% from 1972 to 1976,  on\r\n\r\na compounded basis. This is less than the increase of\r\n\r\n45%  in  the Consumer Price Index. Thus, real  income\r\n\r\nhas  actually fallen by 2.1% despite the  passage  of\r\n\r\ntime and NWC increments and despite the growth in per\r\n\r\ncapita GDP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us examine the effects of inflation and\r\n\r\nthe  NWC  increase on taxes. I have prepared a  table\r\n\r\nbased  on three income levels: Case A refers  to  the\r\n\r\nlower  income  group with a monthly salary  of  $500;\r\n\r\nCase  B is for the middle income group with a monthly\r\n\r\nsalary of $1,500; and Case C the higher income  group\r\n\r\nearning a monthly salary of $4,000. These are  income\r\n\r\nlevels  in  1972,  our base year. Sir,  I  shall  not\r\n\r\nbother the House with the details of the calculations\r\n\r\nwhich I shall attach as an Appendix* to my speech  for\r\n\r\npurpose  of recording in the Hansard, but  only  give\r\n\r\nthe  results of the analysis. On the basis of a four-member  family and the personal reliefs  as  allowed, and  adjusting the 1976 incomes of these three groups (the 1976 income has been increased by 42% from 1972)\r\n\r\nto income at 1972 prices, we find that while monetary\r\n\r\nincome  has grown by 42%, disposable income  in  real\r\n\r\nterms  (income after tax at 1972 prices) has actually\r\n\r\ndecreased  by 3.5% for Case A, 6.8% for  Case  B  and\r\n\r\n11.8%  for Case C as opposed to a fall of 2.1% before\r\n\r\ntax.  The average tax rate for the three cases,  i.e.\r\n\r\ntax  payable  as a percentage of income, has  jumped\r\n\r\nfrom  a  negligible 0.03% to 1 .5% for  Case  A,  the\r\n\r\nlower  income group, from 5.4% to 10.1% for  Case  B,\r\n\r\nthe middle income group, and 19.9% to 27.9% for Case\r\n\r\nC,  the higher income group. But now, let me give you\r\n\r\nthe  real  shocker.  In current  prices, income  has\r\n\r\nincreased by 42% in the four-year\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19770314/19770314-HA-0360907.pdf\"\">APPENDIX - COMPARISON OF TAX LIABILITIES AND DISPOSABLE INCOME BETWEEN 1972 AND 1976 (Cols. 907 - 908)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nperiod  1972 to 1976, but tax liability has increased\r\n\r\nby 99% for Case C, 165% for Case B and 6950% for Case\r\n\r\nA!  Sir,  I  have talked of current prices  and  real\r\n\r\nincome but in truth I am not a \"real\" economist. That\r\n\r\ndistinction belongs to my better qualified colleagues\r\n\r\nfrom the other side of the House, but when the taxman\r\n\r\nbites I can feel real pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not have been so\r\n\r\npainstaking  in trying to quantify the taxman's  bite\r\n\r\nbut  for  an ominous note in page 2 of the Memorandum\r\n\r\non the Main and Development Estimates of Singapore. I\r\n\r\nquote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In FY 76 income tax collections are expected to\r\n\r\nreach  $1,200.0 million which represents a growth  of\r\n\r\nonly  34%  over the actual receipts for the  previous\r\n\r\nfinancial year. The current growth rate is by far the\r\n\r\nlowest  since  FY  71  when the growth  rates  ranged\r\n\r\nbetween 24.3 to 52.8%. The present low growth rate is\r\n\r\nlargely  attributable to the slow economic growth  in\r\n\r\nthe  preceding  year. Also, several  tax  concessions\r\n\r\nhave   been  granted  recently  but  tax  rates  have\r\n\r\nremained unchanged for some years.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>I repeat, \"tax rates have remained unchanged for some\r\n\r\nyears.\"  Sir,  before our tax boys get any  ideas,  I\r\n\r\nsubmit that tax rates must not be changed upwards  in\r\n\r\nthe  next  few years so long as the Minister  expects\r\n\r\ninflation  to take place at about 5-6% per annum, as\r\n\r\nhe informed us on 24th February.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have cautioned earlier in the debate on the\r\n\r\nPresident's Address that whilst inflation may be good\r\n\r\nfor  the  businessman, it can crush the poor and  the\r\n\r\nsalaried  workers. I repeat that warning. The  severe\r\n\r\nbeating  taxpayers have been given despite a rise  in\r\n\r\nmonetary   income  is  because  inflation   increases\r\n\r\nmonetary  earnings  and forces it  upwards  into  the\r\n\r\nhigher  tax  brackets  of  a progressive  income  tax\r\n\r\nstructure. I have already demonstrated its disastrous\r\n\r\neffect on both the lower income and the higher income\r\n\r\ngroups.  We  have  seen that the  biggest  percentage\r\n\r\nincrease in tax liability comes at the lower  end  of\r\n\r\nthe   income   scale,   while   the   tax-bite   gets\r\n\r\nprogressively  bigger  with  income  increases.   The\r\n\r\ndistribution  of  tax  burden by  income  classes  as\r\n\r\noriginally  envisaged is, therefore, altered  in  the\r\n\r\nprocess of inflationary increases in income with\r\n\r\n`See Appendix II, cols 907-8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunchanged tax rates and personal reliefs. I wonder if\r\n\r\nthe Minister for Finance is aware of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the underlying assumption of a progressive tax\r\n\r\nstructure  is  constancy in the purchasing  power  of\r\n\r\nmoney.  If  the  purchasing power  of  money  changes\r\n\r\nrapidly, the tax structure and personal reliefs  must\r\n\r\nbe  reviewed.  I am not asking at this  stage  for  a\r\n\r\nlowering of tax rates as Government must raise enough\r\n\r\nrevenue  to  finance  its  ordinary  and  development\r\n\r\nexpenditures, besides having to build up reserves for\r\n\r\na rainy day. Like the Member for Jalan Kayu, all I am\r\n\r\nasking  is that a thorough review be carried  out  to\r\n\r\nassess the damaging work of the unseen, unwelcome and\r\n\r\nunfeeling tax-man\r\n\r\n-  inflation - and to find a solution to counter  it.\r\n\r\nWith due respect to the Minister for Finance, I think\r\n\r\nall  of  us tax-payers have been diddled, not by  the\r\n\r\nMinister, but by inflation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask, Sir, have we built a case for personal\r\n\r\nreliefs to be increased by, say, $1,000? I submit  we\r\n\r\nhave if the quantum of personal reliefs as originally\r\n\r\nallowed  in 1 948 is intended to apply in real  terms\r\n\r\nto  today's  living environment. Some countries  like\r\n\r\nCanada  have  introduced  indexation  to  income  tax\r\n\r\nreliefs   to   ensure  that  these   reliefs   remain\r\n\r\nmeaningful when cost of living goes up. I suggest the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Finance study this possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me briefly buttress our argument for a tax\r\n\r\nrebate  - for that is what it is if personal  reliefs\r\n\r\nare   increased   -  with  economic  arguments.   The\r\n\r\nGovernment  has vowed to make the economy  grow  fast\r\n\r\nagain,  at  least 6-8% in real terms. The  Government\r\n\r\nhas also emphasized the desirability of keeping costs\r\n\r\ndown, including wages. First, if personal reliefs are\r\n\r\nincreased  by  $1,000, the tax loss to Government  is\r\n\r\n$26 million, By the same token, the money pumped into\r\n\r\nthe  economy  is  $26 million, assuming  this  entire\r\n\r\namount  is spent by the recipients. This should  help\r\n\r\nto  stimulate the economy. With economic growth,  the\r\n\r\ntax collections should increase\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand hence the ultimate tax loss to Government will be\r\n\r\nless  than $26 million. The tax rebate of $26 million\r\n\r\nwill  not  be inflationary as we are an open economy.\r\n\r\nIt is instead expansionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, to the individuals it is real disposable\r\n\r\nincome  that matters, not salary, not even  take-home\r\n\r\npay.  If the real disposable income is inadequate  to\r\n\r\nsustain  a  minimum expected level of  living,  there\r\n\r\nwill  be  pressure by employees to have  their  wages\r\n\r\nincreased.  Tax is an important element of  cost.  So\r\n\r\nlong as the Government can afford it, it is better to\r\n\r\nhave  as  low  a  tax rate as possible  so  that  the\r\n\r\noverall  wage  required by an employee  will  not  be\r\n\r\nartificially pushed up. It is better to  give  a  tax\r\n\r\nrebate, assuming Government can afford it, and have a\r\n\r\nlower  NWC  annual  increase for  the  taxpayers  who\r\n\r\nbenefit from such a rebate, than to give a higher NWC\r\n\r\nannual  increase in order to achieve  the  same  real\r\n\r\ndisposable  income. The end result  is  lower  labour\r\n\r\ncosts with the same real purchasing power after tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads us to the final tantalizing question.\r\n\r\nCan the Government afford to give away $26 million? I\r\n\r\nshall  leave it to the Minister for Finance to answer\r\n\r\nthe question!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>3.45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.\r\n\r\nthis  year again we see a near painless budget  being\r\n\r\nintroduced by the Finance Minister. My repeating this\r\n\r\nis  necessary, although it may sound like a \"cliche\",\r\n\r\nwhen  other countries of the world are suffering from\r\n\r\ninflation and introducing taxes that cut deeply  into\r\n\r\nthe   wage-earners  pocket,  we  have  overcome  this\r\n\r\nproblem through an efficient, honest Government,  and\r\n\r\nan industrious people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although only two existing taxes have been\r\n\r\nincreased  slightly, they are justified in the  light\r\n\r\nof the four tax concessions that are being introduced\r\n\r\nThe tax increases are meant to lessen the cost of our\r\n\r\ndevelopment  expenditure and they  are  non-essential\r\n\r\nitems which will cost only a little extra for a booze\r\n\r\nor a puff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concession in estate duty and the concession on\r\n\r\ntax  for  pensioners are long overdue, Home ownership\r\n\r\nwill  become a practical reality and not a source  of\r\n\r\nworry   to   a   family  that  suddenly   loses   its\r\n\r\nbreadwinner.   Pensioners  will  sigh  with   relief.\r\n\r\nconsidering  that  too  many  of  them  have  seen  a\r\n\r\ncontinuous erosion of their pension through inflation\r\n\r\nin commodity prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax concession on earnings from the Asian\r\n\r\nDollar  Market operations and on reinsurance business\r\n\r\nwill  further  strengthen Singapore  as  a  financial\r\n\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this modest budget is the result of the\r\n\r\ndiligence  and  excellent  planning  of  our  Finance\r\n\r\nMinister, however, we must thank our lucky stars that\r\n\r\nthe world has not suffered too much from inflation in\r\n\r\n1  976. We should keep our fingers crossed and may we\r\n\r\noffer prayers and hope that the present dispute among\r\n\r\nthe  OPEC countries will not result in another  world\r\n\r\nrecession. The people of Singapore appreciate a great\r\n\r\ndeal   the  Government's  anti-profiteering  measures\r\n\r\nwhich  have controlled commodity prices a great deal.\r\n\r\nHowever,   continuous  vigilance  is   necessary   as\r\n\r\nprofiteering  elements are only  waiting  to  make  a\r\n\r\nquick buck, given the slightest opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are getting the tourists that we badly\r\n\r\nneed. However, I wonder whether the infrastructure is\r\n\r\nready  to  meet  this influx of tourists.  Too  often\r\n\r\nthere  have been complaints from tourists about  poor\r\n\r\ntaxi  services  at  the airport, poor  bus  transport\r\n\r\nsystem for tours offered by tour companies and, worst\r\n\r\nof   all, cheating   by  some  taxi   drivers   and\r\n\r\nshopkeepers. What measures are being taken to control\r\n\r\nthese  anti-social elements who bring a bad name  for\r\n\r\nSingapore?  It must not be forgotten that tourism  is\r\n\r\nan important source of foreign exchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good to hear that Singapore will probably\r\n\r\nbecome  a convention centre. However, there seems  to\r\n\r\nbe  little  liaison among the hotels to  ensure  that\r\n\r\nconvention business is evenly distributed among them.\r\n\r\nIn  developing tourism and encouraging  tourists,  we\r\n\r\nnotice that quite often the local\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npeople  are forgotten in the use of facilities  meant\r\n\r\nfor tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, according to the forecast, Singapore's\r\n\r\nperformance will be slowed down this year because  of\r\n\r\nexternal circumstances. However, we too can adjust to\r\n\r\nthese circumstances by conserving our expenditure  in\r\n\r\ncertain   fields.  There  is  too  much  wastage   in\r\n\r\npersonnel,   material  and   energy   in   too   many\r\n\r\ndepartments. For example, street lighting is  changed\r\n\r\ntoo often because of modification, alterations, etc.,\r\n\r\nwastage   in   stationery  because   of   unnecessary\r\n\r\ncorrespondence, and too many persons doing  a  simple\r\n\r\njob  such as installing a gas cooker in a home,  etc.\r\n\r\nAll this and many more can be trimmed. Let us cut our\r\n\r\ncoat according to our cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has been considered a brain centre.\r\n\r\nWe  train  people for the various services.  But,  of\r\n\r\nlate, in  the last few years particularly,  we  have\r\n\r\nseen too many people migrating to other countries. We\r\n\r\nwill  be like the proverbial ostrich that buries  its\r\n\r\nhead in the sand if we just say \"Good riddance to bad\r\n\r\nrubbish\".  Have we found the root cause of migration?\r\n\r\nNot  all of them migrate because the grass is greener\r\n\r\non  the  other  side.  Do people  with  the  \"brains\"\r\n\r\nmigrate because of our educational system, or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  of  job dissatisfaction, or  is  it  because\r\n\r\nfinancially the jobs are non-remunerative, or  is  it\r\n\r\nbecause  they  have  been by-passed  in  a  promotion\r\n\r\nexercise by persons who should not have been there in\r\n\r\nthe  first  place? Let us find the causes and  remedy\r\n\r\nthe situation so as to retain our brains here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of late, there has been a lot of communist\r\n\r\ninfiltration in Singapore through their  lackeys.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt the ISD is doing a good job tracking down these\r\n\r\ntraitors in Singapore. But then the work of  the  ISD\r\n\r\ncould  be supplemented by a \"Board\" which could check\r\n\r\ninfiltration by communist agents, particularly in the\r\n\r\nArmy,  the schools and the tertiary institutions.  No\r\n\r\ndoubt  a  few  have been exposed, but  then, like  a\r\n\r\ncancerous  growth, there are many who have  not  been\r\n\r\napprehended yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to a matter relating to Finance, I wish to\r\n\r\nbring to the attention of this House\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  poor telephone service in Government departments\r\n\r\nand   statutory   boards.   Many   departments   have\r\n\r\nantiquated   switch-boards,  and  it  is  practically\r\n\r\nimpossible to telephone through. Most of the time  we\r\n\r\nfind  that no one answers the call. In the  world  of\r\n\r\nbusiness, time is money. To a businessman who  cannot\r\n\r\ntelephone  through to a Government  department  means\r\n\r\ntime  wasted  and  money lost.  It  is  time  we  did\r\n\r\nsomething  to this part of the service,  although  we\r\n\r\nmay  be  proud of our 374,000 lines. A serious  study\r\n\r\nshould  be  made to rectify this anomaly,  either  to\r\n\r\nincrease  the staff, equipment or lines, whatever  it\r\n\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, rewards to efficient workers are commendable.\r\n\r\nHow  is  productivity measured at  present?  Has  the\r\n\r\nNational  Productivity Board drawn up  guidelines  on\r\n\r\nthe output per worker in industries? The lower income\r\n\r\ngroup workers, particularly the daily rated, find  it\r\n\r\nextremely   difficult   to   meet   their   expenses.\r\n\r\nProductivity-wise, some of the output of  the  daily-rated  workers  is greater than the factory  workers.\r\n\r\nVet  the factory workers may get more for less effort\r\n\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the civil servant, promotions are based on\r\n\r\nmerit and not on allocated grades of appointment.  It\r\n\r\nis  a  wise  move, but what safeguards are there  for\r\n\r\naspiring   civil  servants  who  cannot  be  promoted\r\n\r\nbecause  of  their  superior's  attitudes  or   bias?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some civil servants have been in acting\r\n\r\nposts  for  too long, and they gain neither financial\r\n\r\nremuneration nor peace of mind, for they do not  know\r\n\r\nwhether they will be promoted or even demoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the civil service the idea of reduced-leave\r\n\r\nallowance  was introduced more or less  to  help  the\r\n\r\nofficer whose annual leave was forfeited because of a\r\n\r\nneed  for  their  valuable services  in  the  office.\r\n\r\nHowever, what the Finance Ministry has done to retain\r\n\r\nthe  service of civil servants is being undone by the\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence by its compulsory annual  in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining   of  officers  in  the  national   service.\r\n\r\nValuable manpower is lost during these annual in-camp\r\n\r\ntraining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsessions, and sometimes the absence of a badly needed\r\n\r\nofficer can upset work in an office and bring about a\r\n\r\nchain  reaction  of  indecisions. Precious  time  and\r\n\r\nmoney  is  lost through badly organised and conducted\r\n\r\nin-camp training sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our civil service is commendably efficient.\r\n\r\nThat  is the view of the general public of Singapore.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are some black sheep in the civil\r\n\r\nservice who through their actions bring disrepute  to\r\n\r\nthe   departments   concerned  and   thereby   create\r\n\r\nfrustrations to the public at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although courtesy is a by-word, there are some who\r\n\r\nshow  courtesy  without intending  to  be  courteous.\r\n\r\nCasting commands and unsmiling faces of officers  who\r\n\r\ndeal  with  the  public  bring  about  a  picture  of\r\n\r\nauthority  without  humanity. The  human  element  of\r\n\r\nsympathy  and politeness is missing in  a  number  of\r\n\r\ncivil  servants  who  have daily  dealings  with  the\r\n\r\npublic,  and  above all in dealings among themselves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a campaign \"Courtesy begets courtesy\"  should\r\n\r\nbe introduced in the civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pointless to point out the efficiency of our\r\n\r\ncivil  service if our civil servants end up as  clock\r\n\r\nwatchers. In most departments the staff do not  serve\r\n\r\nthe public beyond the stipulated times. Travelling in\r\n\r\nSingapore  roads  is not easy. It  is  time-consuming\r\n\r\nand,  therefore,  when a person has  travelled  miles\r\n\r\njust  to  pay  a  fee to a particular office  is  not\r\n\r\nserved when he is only 30 seconds late, shows a  lack\r\n\r\nof   humanity  by  the  department.  It  only   earns\r\n\r\ndisrepute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since those above 60 years of age, forming\r\n\r\n6.6% of the population, are people who are likely  to\r\n\r\nget   unwell  more  often  due  to  the  degenerating\r\n\r\nprocess, it is time we considered the plight of these\r\n\r\npeople.  Our  hospital charges are not  low  to  this\r\n\r\ngroup of people. Most of them are not well off. Could\r\n\r\nnot  a  reduced rate of fees be introduced  to  these\r\n\r\npeople,  so  that their meagre earnings will  not  be\r\n\r\neaten away by hospital charges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a picture of efficiency, neatness, and honesty\r\n\r\nin  the civil service could be extended further. Some\r\n\r\ndepartments of the same\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nministry are scattered all over the island. These can\r\n\r\nbe   centralised, thereby  reducing  the   manpower.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  the  buildings of some  Ministries  and\r\n\r\nGovernment  departments could be  \"touched\"  up.  The\r\n\r\nHealth Ministry in Palmer Road, which is supposed  to\r\n\r\ncare  after  the  sick, is an  example  of  a  sickly\r\n\r\nlooking building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is the hope of the people of Singapore\r\n\r\nthat  our  wise  Finance Minister  will  continue  to\r\n\r\nintroduce  future budgets with less pain and  no  new\r\n\r\ntaxes.  Let  us  ride  the waves  of  \"turbulence  in\r\n\r\ninternational  economy\" smoothly and comfortably,  as\r\n\r\nthe people have shown their faith in a PAP Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, a Tamil poet who wrote a poem which\r\n\r\nreads\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n    lyarralum Eattalum Kathalum\r\n\r\n    Katha Vakuthalum Vallathu Arasu\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<br><br>This  most  famous poet wrote this poem  2,000  years\r\n\r\nago,  on how to run the government.

The economic  programme\r\n\r\nfor  the next fiscal year, after all, is an extension\r\n\r\nof  the  Economic Strategy Programme for the  1970's,\r\n\r\nannounced by him in this House some five years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past five years is now part of history, but it\r\n\r\nis  a  history that bears eloquent testimony  to  the\r\n\r\ncorrectness  and  soundness  of  our  approaches   in\r\n\r\neconomic  planning and development. We have withstood\r\n\r\nthe  ravages of severe world economic crises, and our\r\n\r\nGNP indicators show a modest economic growth, despite\r\n\r\nthose crises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have noticed, however, that although more and\r\n\r\nmore  emphasis  is  correctly  being  given  to   our\r\n\r\nmanpower  development programmes for the training  of\r\n\r\nour  younger workers to gain more specialised skills,\r\n\r\nno  mention is made of any attempt to tap and develop\r\n\r\nthe fairly large reservoir of the unskilled and semi-skilled labour force in Singapore. Attempts were made\r\n\r\nin the past to tap the substantial women labour force\r\n\r\nin  the  housing  estates, etc.,  but  I  wonder  how\r\n\r\nsuccessful  these  attempts  have  been.  There   are\r\n\r\nthousands  of  unemployed Singaporeans still  on  the\r\n\r\nEmployment  Register,  and  in  addition,  there  are\r\n\r\nthousands  of  others  not on the  Labour  Ministry's\r\n\r\nEmployment  Register. All of them, whether officially\r\n\r\nregistered  as  unemployed or not, are  actively  and\r\n\r\ndesperately  seeking jobs so that they  can  maintain\r\n\r\ntheir  families. Putting the blame on the job-seekers\r\n\r\nand accusing them of being choosy may be a convenient\r\n\r\nand  neat  way  of  dismissing any  discussion  on  a\r\n\r\ntroublesome issue; but we have still to live with the\r\n\r\nproblem  of  the unemployed in our midst. True,  some\r\n\r\nunemployed  deservedly bear the blame  for  rejecting\r\n\r\njobs offered to them. But there are also those who do\r\n\r\nnot get any offer of jobs. These are the persons that\r\n\r\nfactories and companies will reject outright in their\r\n\r\nlabour  recruitment. These are persons who are  above\r\n\r\nthe age of 40 years and who may be illiterate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a large number of\r\n\r\nworkers who constituted part of the workforce  20  or\r\n\r\nmore   years  ago.  These  persons  came   into   the\r\n\r\nemployment  market in an era where there  was  little\r\n\r\nindustrialisation   in   Singapore   and   when   the\r\n\r\nrequirements  were  the artisan or  the  semi-skilled\r\n\r\nworker.  They  were the products of  our  educational\r\n\r\nsystem  at  that  time  and for  various  social  and\r\n\r\neconomic reasons they had to leave school at an early\r\n\r\nage  and take up employment either as apprentices  or\r\n\r\nas  unskilled labour. The demand for skilled  workers\r\n\r\nat  that  point of time was very limited and so  they\r\n\r\nhad  no alternative but to go to work at a very young\r\n\r\nage.   In   addition,   there  was   practically   no\r\n\r\nopportunity  for  them  to  pursue  higher  education\r\n\r\nbecause they came from poor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfamilies  and  at  that time there  was  little  free\r\n\r\neducation  or scholarships to enable them  to  pursue\r\n\r\nhigher    skills.   Their   technical   or   academic\r\n\r\nqualifications,  therefore, were very  low  but  they\r\n\r\nfulfilled the need at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 17 years, as Singapore industrialised,\r\n\r\nnew  skills  were required and the tendency  is  that\r\n\r\nhigher standards of academic performance are required\r\n\r\nfrom  applicants  aspiring to  train  in  the  skills\r\n\r\nrequired   for   our   industry,  especially   higher\r\n\r\ntechnology industries. Therefore, this large pool  of\r\n\r\nworkers are unable to find employment, although  many\r\n\r\nof  them are quite efficient. If they are given  some\r\n\r\nform of formal training to equip them with the skills\r\n\r\nrequired for modern industry, they will do very  well\r\n\r\nbecause they have gone through the hard times of  the\r\n\r\nfifties  and  will  therefore  be  willing  to   work\r\n\r\nassiduously for a living. It is very easy to  dismiss\r\n\r\nthem  and say that they are underqualified, but  they\r\n\r\nwere  qualified at a time when Singapore needed them.\r\n\r\nAnd  they are now with us. Something, therefore,  has\r\n\r\nto  be  done  to  equip  them  with  skills  to  find\r\n\r\nemployment especially as industry is crying for  more\r\n\r\nskilled and dedicated workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not that these unfortunate\r\n\r\npersons  are being choosy, but that the emphasis  has\r\n\r\nbeen  placed on the new worker with a higher academic\r\n\r\nstandard.  It  is  not to say that  we  do  not  need\r\n\r\nworkers of higher educational standards, but there is\r\n\r\nalso a need and a place for these older workers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers of certain establishments have imposed\r\n\r\nunduly high or exacting requirements of applicants in\r\n\r\nrespect of qualifications or personal appearance,  or\r\n\r\nboth. Let me illustrate this with examples. Take  the\r\n\r\ncase of the hotel establishments in their recruitment\r\n\r\nof  staff.  The  girls  they recruit  must  not  only\r\n\r\npossess  certain minimum academic qualifications  but\r\n\r\nthey must also be tall and have a winsome smile, long\r\n\r\npretty  hair, and be able to charm the customers.  In\r\n\r\nfact, they must have all the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nattributes to induce the male customers to return  to\r\n\r\nthe  warm  and friendly atmosphere of the  respective\r\n\r\nhotel  establishments. Even for  the  job  of  house-keeping  similar attributes, but only at  a  slightly\r\n\r\nlower level, are also expected of the applicants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my union source, a few years ago even\r\n\r\none  local hotel went as far as retrenching the older\r\n\r\nfemale   employees  under  some  pretext  and   later\r\n\r\nrecruited younger girls to fill the jobs left  vacant\r\n\r\nas  the  result of the retrenchment. So at once,  all\r\n\r\nthose  hardworking mothers, who are able to be house-keepers  in a hotel and who wish to supplement  their\r\n\r\nfamily income by working, will find themselves out of\r\n\r\nluck  if  they wish to seek the simple job of  house-keeper  in  a hotel, although they may be  much  more\r\n\r\nefficient in view of their long experience  in  their\r\n\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Government establishments are guilty of\r\n\r\nadopting such a choosy attitude. At one time, to be a\r\n\r\ncar-park attendant, whose job is only a simple  thing\r\n\r\nlike  issuing a receipt, an applicant had to possess,\r\n\r\nat  least a Secondary 2 qualification and be  between\r\n\r\n18  and 25 years old. Luckily, through the efforts of\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry  of Labour, this excessive  stipulation\r\n\r\nhas  been  removed.  Now one needs  only  to  have  a\r\n\r\nPrimary 6 qualification and may even be over 30 years\r\n\r\nof  age  to  be a car-park attendant.  I  can  go  on\r\n\r\nlisting  examples to show that employers have  become\r\n\r\nchoosy.  In  view  of the ease in  employing  certain\r\n\r\ncategories of foreign workers because of our  present\r\n\r\npolicy  on  the issue of work permits, employers  can\r\n\r\ncontinue  to be choosy. But what happens to  many  of\r\n\r\nthe   Singaporeans,  who  are  less  endowed,  either\r\n\r\nphysically  or  academically?  Are  they  to   remain\r\n\r\nforever at a disadvantage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seriously doubt that we are doing enough or as\r\n\r\nmuch  as  we  can  to  help the  unemployed  who  are\r\n\r\nunskilled  and  semiskilled to get  jobs.  Obviously,\r\n\r\nsomething more is needed than just registering  their\r\n\r\nnames  in  the  Employment  Register  of  the  Labour\r\n\r\nMinistry  in the hope that employers will offer  them\r\n\r\njobs.  Services  such  as those  offered  by  private\r\n\r\nemployment agencies in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfiltering    or    screening   out   unsuitable    or\r\n\r\ninappropriate  applicants should be provided  by  the\r\n\r\nMinistry.  Or  are  we  just  concentrating  on   the\r\n\r\ntraining   of  more  persons  with  better   academic\r\n\r\nqualifications or with highly specialised skills  and\r\n\r\ncatering  for the interest of such persons  only?  Is\r\n\r\nthere  an  overall  national  manpower  planning  and\r\n\r\ndevelopment  programme?  Even  if  there  is,  is  it\r\n\r\neffectively   and   efficiently   co-ordinated    and\r\n\r\ncentrally  directed? Or do we just leave the  various\r\n\r\nministries  and  institutions  to  go  on  in   their\r\n\r\nseparate and merry ways?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present moment, one gets the impression that\r\n\r\neach  institution of higher learning has its own idea\r\n\r\nof  what  courses it should provide, without any  due\r\n\r\nconsideration   to  our  overall  national   manpower\r\n\r\nrequirements. The Economic Development Board runs its\r\n\r\nown   technical  training  programmes  together  with\r\n\r\ncertain multi-national companies. Then there  is  the\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Training Board with  a  separate  set  of\r\n\r\nobjectives   and  priorities.  Soon   the   Education\r\n\r\nMinistry will introduce its own Junior Apprenticeship\r\n\r\nTraining  Scheme.  Even  the  MINDEF  joins  in  this\r\n\r\nmultiplicity of training schemes. I would, therefore.\r\n\r\nlike  to  enquire how many of these training  schemes\r\n\r\nare  being  duplicated  and,  therefore,  causing  an\r\n\r\nunnecessary   wastage  of  training  resources,   and\r\n\r\nwhether we are producing too many of one kind and too\r\n\r\nlittle of another kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to be a matter of irrefutable, logical and\r\n\r\ngrave  importance  that,  in  a  small  island   like\r\n\r\nSingapore where human power is the only resource,  we\r\n\r\nshould have a comprehensive and properly co-ordinated\r\n\r\nmanpower planning and development programme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that we do not produce a surfeit\r\n\r\nof highly skilled or specialised personnel and at the\r\n\r\nsame  time completely neglect the unskilled or  semi-skilled  unemployed. For in the end, we  may  not  be\r\n\r\nable  to satisfy the heightened expectations  of  the\r\n\r\nhighly  skilled personnel or the basic desire of  the\r\n\r\nunskilled for any jobs, with the result all  of  them\r\n\r\nwill be frustrated and demoralised,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that in our overall manpower\r\n\r\nplanning  and  development, the unskilled  and  semi-skilled  must be taken into account. In our situation\r\n\r\ntoday, this is all the more important, since we must,\r\n\r\nat  one time or the other, resolve the problem of the\r\n\r\nunusually large number of work permit holders who may\r\n\r\npose  serious problems in political and social  terms\r\n\r\nin time to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.11 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,\r\n\r\nSir,  in his financial statement on the 28th of  last\r\n\r\nmonth,  the  Hon. Minister for Finance  made  a  very\r\n\r\nsignificant conclusion to the effect that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the weather is getting fine and fair and our Ship\r\n\r\nof  State  is  in  good  shape.  The  command  should\r\n\r\ntherefore be \"Steady as she goes.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>As  a matter of fact, our Ship of State, the Republic\r\n\r\nof  Singapore, has been moving steadily all the  time\r\n\r\nas a result of our very steady helmsman and pragmatic\r\n\r\npolicies, and that is the reason for the social  and\r\n\r\neconomic  progress that we are making, as the  saying\r\n\r\ngoes.  \"with  care a ship can sail for  ten  thousand\r\n\r\nyears\".  With care and caution, the helmsman  of  our\r\n\r\nShip  of  State  will  be  able  to  weather  through\r\n\r\ndifficult  times  in  a turbulent  and  unpredictable\r\n\r\ninternational situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the financial statement, the Minister did\r\n\r\nnot  mention any major tax increases. Instead he  has\r\n\r\noffered   four   tax  concessions.  All   these   are\r\n\r\nindications to show the soundness of our economy  and\r\n\r\nthis  should  increase  international  confidence  in\r\n\r\nSingapore. To the people of Singapore, this is  again\r\n\r\na  mild  budget.  If  there are no  unreasonable  tax\r\n\r\nincreases or revision of tariffs in the course of the\r\n\r\nyear, I believe our people will be able to go through\r\n\r\nanother peaceful year comfortably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the budget the Government has\r\n\r\nprovided a loan of $245.9 million for the Jurong Town\r\n\r\nCorporation for the further development of Jurong and\r\n\r\nother  industrial estates. Jurong has been  fortunate\r\n\r\nenough to have been chosen for industrialisation  and\r\n\r\nit  has  become  an internationally known  industrial\r\n\r\narea in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingapore.  This is an honour for the Jurong  people.\r\n\r\nBut  how  many  people realise the hardship  and  the\r\n\r\nprice  the  Jurong  people  have  to  pay  for   this\r\n\r\nindustrial  development? How many people realise  the\r\n\r\nlosses  and the inconvenience suffered by the  people\r\n\r\nof   Jurong  in  the  course  and  as  a  result   of\r\n\r\nindustrialisation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 10 private bus companies have finally\r\n\r\nsucceeded  to merge into one single bus  company  for\r\n\r\nthe  purpose  of  raising  efficiency  and  providing\r\n\r\nbetter  services to the people. But in the Government\r\n\r\nadministration,   there  are   different   Government\r\n\r\ndepartments  separately in charge of matters  of  the\r\n\r\nsame   nature.   For  example,  there   are   several\r\n\r\ndepartments  involved  with  hawkers,  such  as   the\r\n\r\nHawkers'   Department   in  the   Ministry   of   the\r\n\r\nEnvironment, the Housing and Development  Board,  the\r\n\r\nJurong  Town  Corporation and the Port  of  Singapore\r\n\r\nAuthority. Although the major policy may be the same,\r\n\r\nthe  manner  in  which  such policy  is  executed  or\r\n\r\nimplemented  may  be  different  from  department  to\r\n\r\ndepartment or from area to area. For example, in  the\r\n\r\nsame  area, department A is in charge of some hawkers\r\n\r\nand  markets  and  department B in  charge  of  other\r\n\r\nmarkets  and even department C in charge of yet  some\r\n\r\nother  markets  or hawkers, with diverse  regulations\r\n\r\nand  methods.  So  there  is no  consistency  in  the\r\n\r\nimplementation  of the same policy. As  a  result  of\r\n\r\nthis  inconsistency, there would be confusion or even\r\n\r\na feeling of discrimination. In the field of building\r\n\r\nconstruction, we have the HDB, JTC and PSA, in charge\r\n\r\nof  housing. The Housing Board is the largest housing\r\n\r\nagency  in  Singapore, with a lot of experience  over\r\n\r\nthe  past decade. Other statutory boards cannot outdo\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  Board in terms of costing, professional\r\n\r\nsupervision or planning. If the 5-room flats in  Boon\r\n\r\nLay  Garden and Teban Garden were built by  the  HDB.\r\n\r\nthe price would not have been as high as $35,000.  It\r\n\r\nmight well be $30,000, as in the case of 5-room flats\r\n\r\nbuilt  by the H DB in other new towns. Again, if  the\r\n\r\nflats  in Boon Lay Garden were not built by  the  JTC\r\n\r\nbut were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbuilt  by  the HDB, then there would not be lifts  of\r\n\r\ndifferent   brands   from   different   manufacturers\r\n\r\nresulting in frequent breakdowns, a shortage of spare\r\n\r\nparts, and other maintenance problems. Again, if  the\r\n\r\nJTC did not build the executive flats, then the flats\r\n\r\nfor the middle-income group would have been built  by\r\n\r\nthe  HUDC  and  the  purchasers in the  middle-income\r\n\r\ngroup in Jurong would be able to use the CPF for  the\r\n\r\npurchase of the flats, unlike the present where  they\r\n\r\nare  not  allowed to use the CPF for the purchase  of\r\n\r\nflats  built by JTC. This is a very unfair situation.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this duplication and inconsistency,  the\r\n\r\npeople in Jurong have been deprived of their right to\r\n\r\nuse CPF funds to buy their own houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only this, a lot of land in Jurong is earmarked\r\n\r\nfor  development purposes. The matter of resettlement\r\n\r\nis  in the hands of the Resettlement Department under\r\n\r\nJTC, while the matter of adjudging who is a bona-fide\r\n\r\nfarmer and who is not, is not made by the JTC but  by\r\n\r\nthe Primary Production Department in the Ministry  of\r\n\r\nNational  Development. Because the Primary Production\r\n\r\nDepartment  is  not  directly  concerned   with   the\r\n\r\ndevelopment of the area, it takes its own sweet  time\r\n\r\nto  establish who are the bona-fide farmers  and  who\r\n\r\nare  not,  and because of the dispute in this  matter\r\n\r\nthe  development  plan is delayed. So  these  farmers\r\n\r\nhave  to stay put where they are. Last year, at  the\r\n\r\n20th  km  Jurong  Road (now it comes under  Boon  Lay\r\n\r\nconstituency) some farmers had to stay put because of\r\n\r\nthe  delay. Then, because of the rainy season at that\r\n\r\ntime  there was flooding. They again suffered  losses\r\n\r\nbecause  their livestock were drowned in the  floods.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  these people affected  by  resettlement\r\n\r\nhad  to  apply for shops and flats from  the  JTC  in\r\n\r\norder  to be eligible for concessions. Otherwise,  if\r\n\r\nthey  apply  to  the HDB for such accommodation  they\r\n\r\nwill  be  treated like any other ordinary applicants.\r\n\r\nThere  are  sufficient residential flats  in  housing\r\n\r\nestates  under JTC. But the problem is that there  is\r\n\r\nan  inadequate supply of shophouses built by the  JTC\r\n\r\nfor  allocation  to  these  people  affected  by  the\r\n\r\nresettlement schemes, thus causing a lot of problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the Government will consider\r\n\r\nunified control and management and do away with  this\r\n\r\nduplication of duties and administration in order  to\r\n\r\nraise  efficiency and avoid unnecessary problems  and\r\n\r\ntrouble. That is, all the hawkers' problems should be\r\n\r\ncentralised and dealt with by one central  authority,\r\n\r\nthe   Hawkers   Department;   resettlement   problems\r\n\r\nsimilarly  handled  by  one  centralised  department;\r\n\r\nindustrial  problems for example, by  the  JTC,  and\r\n\r\nhousing  matters  by the HDB, We  are  talking  about\r\n\r\nefficiency  of  the Government. We  should  not  have\r\n\r\nunnecessary  waste  and  duplication  of  our   human\r\n\r\nresources  and  efforts.  I hope  the  Minister  will\r\n\r\nseriously consider these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy of the Minister\r\n\r\nfor Finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>4.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Bedok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nrise  to join my other colleagues in support  of  the\r\n\r\nBudget Statement made by the Minister for Finance for\r\n\r\nthe financial year 1977-78.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues spoke in high praise. They were\r\n\r\ngreatly  impressed by the presentation of the  fiscal\r\n\r\npolicy which, on the whole, gives a rather optimistic\r\n\r\npicture  of our economic prospects. All these  years,\r\n\r\nthe  Minister  for Finance's Budget  Statements  have\r\n\r\nalways been supported by facts and figures. This year\r\n\r\nis  no exception. He has the Economic Survey to  back\r\n\r\nhim up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although I am not competent enough to give an\r\n\r\nin-depth  analysis of the economic prospects  of  our\r\n\r\ncountry. I would like to contribute some ideas by way\r\n\r\nof  one or two observations. It is my hope that these\r\n\r\nobservations  and ideas would find  a  place  in  the\r\n\r\nvarious aspects of planning and strategy to make  the\r\n\r\nnation  an even better place to live in, to work  in,\r\n\r\nand to conduct business in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, it is common knowledge that\r\n\r\nSingapore's success story has been, and is to a  very\r\n\r\nlarge extent, due to its political stability and  the\r\n\r\npragmatic leadership of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPAP  government, a government that has the  foresight\r\n\r\nand  the  far-sightedness to  chart  troubled  waters\r\n\r\nahead, thereby enabling it to go through and overcome\r\n\r\nthe  many  stormy  seas lying  in  the  path  of  the\r\n\r\ncountry's economic, social and political progress. We\r\n\r\nhave   been  able  to  take  positive  and  realistic\r\n\r\nmeasures  that have helped us to come out  of  crisis\r\n\r\nafter  crisis in the recent past - the energy crisis,\r\n\r\ninflation,  economic  recession,  etc.  -  relatively\r\n\r\nunscathed. In spite of the many world-wide  problems,\r\n\r\nSingapore   has  been  able  to  achieve  commendable\r\n\r\neconomic growth and development. In this respect, the\r\n\r\npart played by our efficient civil service should not\r\n\r\nbe   overlooked.  The  civil  service  has  made  its\r\n\r\nvaluable contribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is most heartening is the part played by\r\n\r\nthe  people of Singapore at large. We have been  able\r\n\r\nto keep wage increases, for example, to proportionate\r\n\r\nlevels  so  that the situation would not get  out  of\r\n\r\nhand,  thereby endangering the economic  position  of\r\n\r\nthe  country. This has been possible because  of  the\r\n\r\ncooperation  of  the people of Singapore.  The  close\r\n\r\nrapport the Government has been able to achieve  with\r\n\r\nthe people is, in many ways, the deciding factor. The\r\n\r\nrecent  General Elections, in which the  PAP  made  a\r\n\r\nclean  sweep,  was ample testimony of the  confidence\r\n\r\nand  the  rapport  existing. The Government  and  the\r\n\r\npeople, together, have proved Singapore's prophets of\r\n\r\ndoom  all wrong, all the way. Those who have  written\r\n\r\noff  Singapore, those who have tried to  subvert  the\r\n\r\nnation, those who have left the country because  they\r\n\r\nthought  we were doomed to sink, are now all  red  in\r\n\r\nthe  face  with envy and embarrassment. These  people\r\n\r\nare now having second thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent disclosures and confessions of G. Raman\r\n\r\nand  his  repentant  colleagues  are  examples.  They\r\n\r\nwanted to put Singapore in bad light internationally.\r\n\r\nThey  wanted to discredit the country. They  did  not\r\n\r\nwant  to  see  the  nation  make  good,  prosper  and\r\n\r\nprogress.  They tried to subvert Singapore.  We  know\r\n\r\nnow  why  reputable publications, which  should  have\r\n\r\nknown better in the first place, like the Far Eastern\r\n\r\nEconomic  Review,  the Financial Times,  and  others,\r\n\r\nwere so\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncritical  of  Singapore. But  there  will  always  be\r\n\r\npeople like G. Raman and company who fall prey to the\r\n\r\nevil designs and machinations of foreigners and Euro-communists bent on seeing the downfall of the PAP and\r\n\r\nSingapore.  They  perpetrate  acts  which  are   both\r\n\r\ntreacherous  and  traitorous.  But  they   will   not\r\n\r\nsucceed.  They will not succeed simply  because  they\r\n\r\nare  acting  against the interests of the  people  of\r\n\r\nSingapore   as  a  whole,  their  well-being,   their\r\n\r\nhappiness, their future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future - what does it hold for us? A good one,\r\n\r\nI  believe, if we together put our shoulders  to  the\r\n\r\nwheel.  Looking at the prospects for the fiscal  year\r\n\r\n1977-78,  as  strategically outlined by the  Minister\r\n\r\nfor   Finance,  there  appears  to  be   five   basic\r\n\r\nobjectives  -  namely, manpower development,  science\r\n\r\nand    technology,   infrastructure,   taxation   and\r\n\r\npromotion,  and  the measures to be  taken  by  major\r\n\r\nindustrialised countries to stimulate their economies\r\n\r\nby   creating  more  employment.  In  this   context,\r\n\r\nSingapore  can confidently look to the future  if  we\r\n\r\nkeep   the  present  momentum.  However,  Singapore's\r\n\r\nfuture  is,  of course, not all a bed of roses.  With\r\n\r\nhigher  standards  of  living,  a  better  life,  and\r\n\r\ngreater  affluence,  there  will  be  problem  areas,\r\n\r\nparticularly  among  the younger  generation  of  the\r\n\r\npopulation.  There will be changes in job  attitudes.\r\n\r\nExpectations go higher each day. There  will  be  the\r\n\r\ncrave  for better life-styles. All this can  generate\r\n\r\nand coagulate into one big social evil. But it can be\r\n\r\nprevented.  Youth  tends to  be  restless,  and  this\r\n\r\nrestlessness must not at any time be ignored. In  our\r\n\r\neagerness and anxiety to achieve something, we  often\r\n\r\nstumble and fall over the most obvious. Therein  lies\r\n\r\nthe  danger.  And  the young is one of  our  greatest\r\n\r\nassets.  It  can  also turn out  to  be  one  of  our\r\n\r\ngreatest drawbacks, if we neglect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young is a creature of many potentials and\r\n\r\nparadoxes. It is the country's source of manpower. It\r\n\r\nforms  the sinews of the nation. It forms the  future\r\n\r\nleadership.   Yet  it  is  ever  so  susceptible   to\r\n\r\ninfluences and distractions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndrugs,  crime,  political clutches, and  other  anti-social  and anti-national behaviour and conduct.  The\r\n\r\ndistracted youth can, collectively, become both a de-stablising  and a destructive force in  society.  But\r\n\r\naccorded  the  correct channels of communication  and\r\n\r\nconstructive  activity, the young  is  undoubtedly  a\r\n\r\nfactor  in  the  nation's favour.  Given  avenues  of\r\n\r\nexpression  and performance areas that are  conducive\r\n\r\nto  productive results, our youth can be the fountain\r\n\r\nof life in Singapore's future. In short, youth has an\r\n\r\nimportant role to play in the affairs of the  nation.\r\n\r\nThis  is amply demonstrated everywhere: where youth's\r\n\r\nrole  has  been positive, the results have been  most\r\n\r\nconstructive;  where its role has been negative,  the\r\n\r\nconsequences have been very destructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, I would like to touch upon the\r\n\r\nsubject of youth in Singapore. What are we doing  for\r\n\r\nthese   young   people?  The  primary   establishment\r\n\r\nresponsible  for  the right answer to  this  question\r\n\r\nappears  to  be  the  People's  Association.  It   is\r\n\r\nacknowledged that the People's Association is doing a\r\n\r\ngood  job. But is it doing enough? That is  the  more\r\n\r\nimportant question. It is noticed that in many of the\r\n\r\ncommunity   centres,   real   activity    is    often\r\n\r\nconspicuously absent. They appear to be deserted most\r\n\r\nof  the  time.  It will be interesting  to  know  the\r\n\r\nactual  response,  both  in  terms  of  numbers   and\r\n\r\npercentages,  to  programmes of activities  that  are\r\n\r\nplanned by community centres. We know that more  than\r\n\r\nhalf  of  our population are under 21 years  of  age.\r\n\r\nThey form the core of our young. How many of them are\r\n\r\nattracted  to the activities of the various community\r\n\r\ncentres  and  the People's Association? I  understand\r\n\r\nthe  figure  is  very small. Many activity-programmes\r\n\r\nlook   good  on  paper.  But  it  is  the  areas   of\r\n\r\nperformance, participation and production of  desired\r\n\r\nresults that really count. How and where do we  stand\r\n\r\nin  this respect? It is a question worth pursuing  at\r\n\r\nthis  stage of the country's progress, because it  is\r\n\r\nimportant that we take stock, assess and evaluate the\r\n\r\nposition, so that strength and weaknesses are brought\r\n\r\nto  light. In this manner we can consolidate the good\r\n\r\nand eliminate the bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This question of youth is also directed to other\r\n\r\nareas,  not  just  the People's Association.  Several\r\n\r\nMinistries have close connection and association with\r\n\r\nyouth  and  youth  matters  too.  For  example,   the\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Education is in the forefront  in  this\r\n\r\nregard.  The Ministry of Social Affairs, as  well  as\r\n\r\nthose  of Home Affairs, Defence, Culture and  Science\r\n\r\nand  Technology, are all inextricably  involved  with\r\n\r\nthe young. No doubt there are all kinds of activities\r\n\r\ngoing  on  in all these places; whether or  not  such\r\n\r\nactivities  are designed particularly  for  youth  is\r\n\r\nanother matter. Whether or not there is cohesion  and\r\n\r\nproper planning and execution in these activities  is\r\n\r\nanother  question. Whether or not there is a  lot  of\r\n\r\nunnecessary  duplication and therefore  manpower  and\r\n\r\ntime wastage is also worthwhile looking into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I am making. Sir, is whether or not the\r\n\r\nquestion  of  co-ordination of youth  activities  has\r\n\r\ncrossed  the  minds  of the planners  and  programme-directors.  Perhaps  a  Department  of  Youth  or   a\r\n\r\nMinistry  of  Youth would be the answer.  Admittedly,\r\n\r\nthis  is not a new suggestion, but it is a fresh call\r\n\r\nfor   more  thought  and  greater  concern.  The   co\r\n\r\nordination  of youth affairs and youth matters  is  a\r\n\r\nvital  aspect of our growing society, a society which\r\n\r\nis  wide  open to influences of all kinds,  Singapore\r\n\r\nbeing  what  she  is  geographically,  socially   and\r\n\r\neconomically. As I have stated earlier on, correct co-ordination  and guidance of youth is  of  the  utmost\r\n\r\nimportance. The quality of our youth, its  mentality.\r\n\r\nits  attitudes,  its responses, are  all  necessarily\r\n\r\naspects  of  society the leadership has  to  be  very\r\n\r\nconcerned  about.  \"Today's  young  people  are   to-morrow's  leaders\"  -that, as it may,  is  a  cliche.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,  a  cliche with  a  tremendous  lot  of\r\n\r\nmeaning and message in it. One misguided youth  is  a\r\n\r\nproblem.  A whole lot of misguided young people  will\r\n\r\nbe  disastrous. It is therefore imperative  that  we,\r\n\r\nwho  are  today's leaders, pay sufficient, and  more,\r\n\r\nattention  to  this  vital question  of  guiding  and\r\n\r\ninculcating  in  the  young,  correct  attitudes  and\r\n\r\nresponses through a concerted and co-ordinated  youth\r\n\r\nprogramme,  allowing  at the same  time, avenues  of\r\n\r\nexpression  and  criticism, so  long  as  these  are\r\n\r\npositive and constructive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, in the final analysis, Sir, the battleground\r\n\r\nlies in the mind.

In\r\n\r\nthe  field of technical and industrial training,  the\r\n\r\nGovernment is emphasising the training of  skills  in\r\n\r\nthe   engineering   trades,  metal   machining,   and\r\n\r\nfabrication  as  well  as  on  selected   fields   of\r\n\r\nprecision  engineering. This is a piece of good  news\r\n\r\nto   our  workers,  because  through  industrial  and\r\n\r\ntechnical training the skills of our workers will  be\r\n\r\nraised  so  that  the products will be  of  a  better\r\n\r\nquality.  This in turn will raise their  productivity\r\n\r\nand  improve the workers' remuneration comparatively.\r\n\r\nBecause  of  this,  our workers with  better  skills,\r\n\r\nincreased productivity, and increased income will  be\r\n\r\nable  to live a better life than before. On the other\r\n\r\nhand,  because our products are of good  quality  and\r\n\r\nwith  increased  productivity, our products  will  be\r\n\r\nable  to compete better in the international markets,\r\n\r\nthus  stimulating our economic growth.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nmeet the needs of our commerce and industry for their\r\n\r\nrapid growth the Government has allotted more land,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpand   communication  network  and  increased   our\r\n\r\nelectricity  capacity.  This  policy  will   directly\r\n\r\npromote  our  economic growth and help to  solve  the\r\n\r\nemployment  problem of our people. In  the  meantime,\r\n\r\nthe   Government   is  allocating  land   for   civic\r\n\r\norganisations,  such as churches, youth  associations\r\n\r\nand  others  for them to build their headquarters  or\r\n\r\noffices.  Trade  unions are also civic organisations.\r\n\r\nThey  have great responsibilities in respect  of  the\r\n\r\neconomic development of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look back to 1968 when the British military\r\n\r\nforces  planned  a  withdrawal  from  Singapore, our\r\n\r\neconomic prospect was then not at all optimistic  and\r\n\r\nnobody  could  predict the fate that was  facing  us.\r\n\r\nHowever,  under  the  able  leadership  of  the   PAP\r\n\r\nGovernment  we  have  passed  and  overcome  many  an\r\n\r\neconomic  difficulty. In the interest of  the  nation\r\n\r\nand  for  the  long-term interest of our workers,  at\r\n\r\nthat  time  our workers had resolutely taken  up  the\r\n\r\nchallenge  of  a patriotic mission and they  accepted\r\n\r\nthe Employment Act, 1968 and the Industrial Relations\r\n\r\n(Amendment)   Act,  1968.  That   we   have   today's\r\n\r\nprosperity  is  also  due to  the  workers'  resolute\r\n\r\naction  taken then. Therefore, our workers have  made\r\n\r\nindelible contributions towards our nation-building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, trade unions not only take part in\r\n\r\nnegotiations for working conditions and the  benefits\r\n\r\nof  our  workers but also take part in  national  and\r\n\r\nsocial activities. The National Trades Union Congress\r\n\r\nhas  resolutely  taken  up  the  task  of  organising\r\n\r\ncooperative  supermarkets  in  order  to   curb   the\r\n\r\nincreasing  prices  of consumer goods.  In  order  to\r\n\r\nrespond  to the Government's call for more  women  to\r\n\r\nengage  themselves in production work,  trade  unions\r\n\r\nhave also resolutely taken over or set up creches. In\r\n\r\norder  to be more involved in social activities,  the\r\n\r\ntrade  unions  have  organised kindergartens,  health\r\n\r\ncentres,  issued  primary, secondary  and  university\r\n\r\nscholarships to children of union members,  sponsored\r\n\r\nfamily  planning courses, organised various  cultural\r\n\r\nand recreational activities, actively promoted sports\r\n\r\nactivities, visited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhomes   for  the  aged  and  taken  part   in   blood\r\n\r\ntransfusion, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, in order to support the National\r\n\r\nWages  Council's recommendations, trade  unions  have\r\n\r\nactively  set up productivity committees under  their\r\n\r\nbranch  unions to increase productivity. This  is  in\r\n\r\nkeeping with the national policy. In order to support\r\n\r\nthe   Ministry  of  Labour's  effort  in   preventing\r\n\r\nindustrial accidents, trade unions have also actively\r\n\r\nset  up industrial health and safety committees under\r\n\r\ntheir branch unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these facts enumerated above have demonstrated\r\n\r\nthe  contributions made by trade unions in our social\r\n\r\nprogress and economic development. Therefore. I  hope\r\n\r\nthe  Government will also consider allowing the trade\r\n\r\nunions  to  purchase industrial land to  build  trade\r\n\r\nunion  houses to serve our workers. When  any  worker\r\n\r\nmeets  with any difficulty, he could promptly  go  to\r\n\r\nthe  union  for  consultation. I also hope  that  the\r\n\r\nGovernment  will also consider providing recreational\r\n\r\nand  sports facilities around trade union  houses  so\r\n\r\nthat  our  workers can take part in these  activities\r\n\r\nafter work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.07 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr J.

(Thank you) Now\r\n\r\nthis  quality  of foresight, of forward  preparation,\r\n\r\nhas  always  characterised  the  style  and  planning\r\n\r\nbehaviour   of  our  Government,  and   the   Finance\r\n\r\nMinister's  latest Budget statement  merely  marks  a\r\n\r\ncontinuation of this principle of early planning  for\r\n\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing that has excited my attention is\r\n\r\na certain subtle feature of the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndiction  in  the  budget address. It  is  that  while\r\n\r\npreviously the Finance Minister has talked of policy,\r\n\r\nand   the   word   policy  has  occurred   frequently\r\n\r\npreviously, in this year's Budget statement there  is\r\n\r\na greater resort to the use of the term strategy. The\r\n\r\nword  strategy has been used at least six  times  and\r\n\r\nthe Minister has even used the word tactics once. The\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister is far from being a bellicose  sort\r\n\r\nof  person but the military aspect of his diction has\r\n\r\ninduced  me to look up Sun Tzu's Art of War.  In  the\r\n\r\npopular  translation by Samuel Griffith, by a strange\r\n\r\ncoincidence, the first chapter of the Art of  War  is\r\n\r\nheaded `Estimates'. Another version translates (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (ji\r\n\r\npian)  as  Essay  or Chapter on `Deliberation'.  Both\r\n\r\nheadings,  Estimates or Deliberation, are appropriate\r\n\r\nto  describe the Minister's Budget statement. But let\r\n\r\nus  take  Sun Tzu's `Estimates' and consider what  he\r\n\r\nsays  in  this  first chapter about five  fundamental\r\n\r\nfactors on which `Estimates' or `Deliberation' should\r\n\r\nbe  based. These are, firstly, the moral influence or\r\n\r\nmoral cause, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (dao); secondly, the weather or\r\n\r\nclimatic conditions, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (tian), thirdly, the terrain\r\n\r\nor terrestrial conditions (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (di), fourthly,\r\n\r\ncommand or generalship of commanders, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (jiang); and\r\n\r\nfifthly, doctrine or organisation and discipline, (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)(fa). Let us apply these conditions to what our Finance Minister has done in his Budget statement,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have to say a little more on the first\r\n\r\nfactor, moral influence, later, but in terms  of  the\r\n\r\nsecond factor, climatic conditions, the Minister  has\r\n\r\nsaid  the  weather is getting fair and  our  Ship  of\r\n\r\nState  is  in  good state: \"steady as she  goes.\"  In\r\n\r\nterms   of   the  second  factor,  the   terrain   or\r\n\r\nterrestrial conditions, the terrain may be rugged but\r\n\r\nwe  have also the Minister's own five basic programme\r\n\r\nobjectives to help traverse this terrain, namely, his\r\n\r\nprogramme   related   to   manpower,   science    and\r\n\r\ntechnology,  infrastructure, taxation and  promotion.\r\n\r\nAnd  of  course the strategy will be a very  flexible\r\n\r\none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the fourth factor, generalship, Sun\r\n\r\nTzu,  when he talks of command, says he means by this\r\n\r\nthe general's qualities of wisdom, faith, compassion,\r\n\r\ncourage and strictness. Our general in charge of  our\r\n\r\nfinancial strategy has\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nall these qualities. He is wise, he is a man of faith\r\n\r\n-  he  is  one of the 10% who are Catholics  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse. His budget has continually good indications of\r\n\r\ncompassion.  For example, with effect from  the  1976\r\n\r\nyear  of  assessment, the earned  income  relief  was\r\n\r\nincreased  from $1,000 to $2,000 for  those  over  55\r\n\r\nyears  old  and $3,000 for those over 60  years  old.\r\n\r\nThis  year  the tax concession with regard to  estate\r\n\r\nduty  and  also the other concession with  regard  to\r\n\r\npensioners paying income tax also show that he  is  a\r\n\r\nman  of  compassion. Where courage and discipline  or\r\n\r\nrigour  are  concerned, anybody  who  has  been  made\r\n\r\nFinance    Minister    by   our   Government    would\r\n\r\nautomatically  have these virtues:  as  the  Minister\r\n\r\nhimself has shown in the rigour with which he imposed\r\n\r\nthe  well-known and well-felt car taxes announced  on\r\n\r\n1st January, 1976\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the last factor, namely organisation and\r\n\r\ncontrol, assignment of appropriate ranks to officers,\r\n\r\nis  concerned,  the  Minister has  touched  on  civil\r\n\r\nservice  expenditure, in respect of which he promises\r\n\r\nrigorous  pruning, and on the development of  quality\r\n\r\nof  our  managerial and executive grades. From  these\r\n\r\ngeneral  guidelines  we can see that  there  is  able\r\n\r\ndirection in the battle for economic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me take up more particularly, and more\r\n\r\nseriously,  the  first of Sun Tzu's five  fundamental\r\n\r\nfactors - the one I merely mentioned, but did not say\r\n\r\nmore  about, namely - moral influence or moral cause.\r\n\r\nAnd this, Sun Tzu says (and I quote from the Griffith translation): \"By moral influence, I mean that  which\r\n\r\ncauses the people to be in harmony with their leaders\r\n\r\n...\".  And  it  is  the  necessity  for  harmony   in\r\n\r\ndifferent  segments of our society  that  I  want  to\r\n\r\nstress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the Deputy Prime Minister stated that\r\n\r\n[Straits Times, 28th February, 1977]:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Government had provided the masses with the best\r\n\r\nsafeguard   against   communist  revolution   through\r\n\r\ncontinuous economic development'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This development would not have been possible without\r\n\r\nthe  harmonious  relationship between the  Government\r\n\r\nand  the  people.  This harmony has to  be  cherished\r\n\r\nbecause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrecent   events   have  shown  that  occasions   will\r\n\r\ncontinually   arise  wherein  we  will  find   people\r\n\r\ncontinually  plotting to injure this same  harmonious\r\n\r\nassociation or communication,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very latest instance has related to the\r\n\r\ndisclosures about \"black operations\" that  have  been\r\n\r\naimed   at  spoiling  the  good  reputation  of   the\r\n\r\nleadership in the people's eyes. This instance is all\r\n\r\nthe   more  significant  in  view  of  some   special\r\n\r\ncircumstances I would like to refer to. Sir, I was  a\r\n\r\nmember  of  a parliamentary delegation which  visited\r\n\r\nMalaysia last year. The welcome we received was  most\r\n\r\ncordial  indeed, and we felt that everywhere we  went\r\n\r\nwe  were  greeted by warm and sincere expressions  of\r\n\r\nfriendship,   including  those  of   the   very   top\r\n\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet within the `very setting where there was\r\n\r\nsincere  recognition of basic identity  of  interests\r\n\r\nespecially  in  matters concerning security  and  the\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   ASEAN,  there  have   been   found\r\n\r\nindividuals who have been accused of such plotting as\r\n\r\nwould, if successful, have spoilt the harmony between\r\n\r\nour  people  and our leaders, subverted intellectuals\r\n\r\nand  students, and  finally affected  adversely  our\r\n\r\neconomic development.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on this point of security, it is good to\r\n\r\npoint  out  that the relationship, in  good  balance,\r\n\r\nbetween the leadership and the people has resulted in\r\n\r\na  rather  special political situation. We have  been\r\n\r\none  party in Parliament for nearly ten years through\r\n\r\nthree  successive elections. And throughout all  that\r\n\r\ntime  we  have  continued  to  plan  for  Singapore's\r\n\r\nsuccessful development in the way the present  budget\r\n\r\nalso  shows.  I am sure that it is much more  than  a\r\n\r\ncoincidence  that our best development,  and  control\r\n\r\nover this development, took place when the Government\r\n\r\nparty was in full possession of all the seats in this\r\n\r\nHouse. I think it is more than a coincidence that  it\r\n\r\nhas happened this way. Therefore, it might not be out\r\n\r\nof  place to remark that for the time being at least,\r\n\r\na  so-called  parliamentary opposition is  irrelevant\r\n\r\nfor our continued development. The real\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nopposition  walked out of this House some  time  ago,\r\n\r\nbecause  it was not the Government party they  wanted\r\n\r\nand  still want to do in, but Singapore itself.  They\r\n\r\ntalk   of   a   unitary  state  of  Malaya  including\r\n\r\nSingapore.  And the so-called would-be  parliamentary\r\n\r\nopposition  plays footsies with such and other  anti-national elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall, therefore, have to be on a constant alert\r\n\r\nto  promote  and  foster harmony in our  society,  to\r\n\r\nensure  development. When we talk of  development  we\r\n\r\ncannot   separate  the  human,  cultural,   spiritual\r\n\r\naspects  of development from the material. The  whole\r\n\r\npurpose    of   development   -   improved   economic\r\n\r\nconditions, more and better jobs, enhanced quality of\r\n\r\nthe  environment  - is the betterment  of  the  human\r\n\r\ncondition, the total human condition. In Singapore it\r\n\r\nis quite in order to point out that man does not live\r\n\r\non  bread alone. He has bread in the vast majority of\r\n\r\ncases   and  even  circuses  - witness  the   football\r\n\r\nenthusiasm  at  the  National  Stadium.   To   ensure\r\n\r\ndevelopment,  to make sure our people  enjoy  a  good\r\n\r\nlife,  we  must  also see to the importance  of  good\r\n\r\ncommunication  between  Singaporeans,  for  what   is\r\n\r\nsuggested  by  \"moral  influence\"  and  \"harmony\"  is\r\n\r\nbrought about by good communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have deliberately used the term \"good\r\n\r\ncommunication\"  because just as material  development\r\n\r\ndepends   on  good  communication  such   as   roads,\r\n\r\ntelephone and radio communication, ships, aeroplanes,\r\n\r\nradar,  satellites  and  so on,  the  development  of\r\n\r\npeople  as  rooted,  civilised, cultured  and  humane\r\n\r\ndepends  also on communication of another  kind.  And\r\n\r\nthis  communication may be described in the sense  of\r\n\r\nthe  Christian,  St.  Paul's  injunction  that  \"Evil\r\n\r\ncommunications corrupt good manners\", or in the sense\r\n\r\nof  \"propriety\" in Chinese tradition,  but  it  deals\r\n\r\nwith  consideration and human relations, and in  fact\r\n\r\nis the criterion of such relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan is a fine example of how the acquisition of\r\n\r\nmodern material means of communication did not affect\r\n\r\nJapanese society with a shudder, because a lot of the\r\n\r\ntraditional forms of communication were\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npreserved and, in fact, used to cushion the shock  of\r\n\r\nassimilating   the  new  and  impersonal   means   of\r\n\r\ncommunication, It does seem ironic that Singapore  is\r\n\r\none   of  the  world's  most  important  centres   of\r\n\r\ncommunication,  and yet communication between  people\r\n\r\nin  the  sense of regard, consideration,  concern,  a\r\n\r\nsense of identity has yet to be profoundly instilled.\r\n\r\nIn   Japan, the   very  network  of   interpersonal\r\n\r\ncommunications traditionally developed and  supported\r\n\r\nhas  contributed to Japan's growth as an economically\r\n\r\npowerful state, despite the fact that there has  been\r\n\r\nsome erosion of traditional values as a result of the\r\n\r\nimpact of modernisation. In Japan, you still find the\r\n\r\nrelationship   between  worker  and   employer   very\r\n\r\npersonal  and bound by ties of loyalty and  pride  of\r\n\r\nidentification with the company. There still prevails\r\n\r\na  kind  of  industrial morality which  frowns  on  a\r\n\r\nworker (whatever the level of his education, training\r\n\r\nand  expertise) moving from one employer to  another.\r\n\r\nThe  quality control movement, depending so  much  on\r\n\r\ncooperation   (i.e, good   communication)   between\r\n\r\nworkers,  has taken such a root in Japanese  industry\r\n\r\nthat  they  are even able to strive after  what  they\r\n\r\ncall ZD, namely Zero Defect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to improve our sense of communication, and\r\n\r\nwe  cannot  find a better place to start setting  the\r\n\r\nexample  of  good  communication than  in  Parliament\r\n\r\nHouse itself in this very debating Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the debate on the President's address was very\r\n\r\nlively  indeed.  Much  heat was generated  and  light\r\n\r\nthrown on several matters. Disagreements, where  they\r\n\r\noccurred,  were  sometimes  vehement.  I  hope   such\r\n\r\nconditions  will  continue  to  prevail, during  the\r\n\r\nBudget debate and after. So what, if we sometimes  do\r\n\r\nnot  agree  with  one another. I remember  reading  a\r\n\r\nremark  by  a  person  called  Wrigley  (probably  of\r\n\r\nchewing  gum fame) to the effect that in a  business,\r\n\r\nif  two  people always agreed, then one of  them  was\r\n\r\nredundant.  So,  in  Parliament,  we  must  agree  to\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, whatever the new styles we may want to\r\n\r\nadopt  in our own Parliament, for it is correct  that\r\n\r\nwe should not merely imitate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  Westminster  model of behaviour  of  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament;  whatever Standing Orders we change,  for\r\n\r\nthey may in certain instances bear changing, we could\r\n\r\ncertainly  set  an example of harmony (or  the  moral\r\n\r\ninfluence  of  Sun  Tzu or the good  communication  I\r\n\r\nspoke  of  just now) if we tried to bear  in  mind  a\r\n\r\ncertain dictum of Confucius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eponymous - this word means `same name'.\r\n\r\nActually  it  was the Member for Kampong  Chai  Chee\r\n\r\nwho   gave   the  name  to  me.

Sir, to encourage the growth  among\r\n\r\nSingaporeans of a sense of identity with  people  and\r\n\r\nplace?  I  think  we have to keep  worrying  at  this\r\n\r\nquestion. We certainly do not know what is  going  to\r\n\r\nhappen - exactly. But we most certainly also have  to\r\n\r\nthink of decisions to make about what interactions we\r\n\r\ncan   contrive   to  enlarge  our  understanding   of\r\n\r\nourselves  as Singaporeans: We have to make decisions\r\n\r\nbeyond  those we have taken; such decisions  that  we\r\n\r\nhave  taken like our language policy which the  Prime\r\n\r\nMinister  elaborated  on in his marathon  speech, or\r\n\r\nlike our stress on returns to effort and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncontribution,  or like our subscription  to  economic\r\n\r\ngrowth  as the basis for social development, or  like\r\n\r\nwe  say,  \"We  want to have friendly  relations  with\r\n\r\ncommunist  countries but internally communism  is  an\r\n\r\nincompatible   ideology   where   our   society    is\r\n\r\nconcerned\". These decisions we have made. But we have\r\n\r\ngot  to  go beyond. We have got to think of decisions\r\n\r\nbeyond those which we have already made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to face the fact that perhaps we have to\r\n\r\ntake   decisions  about  matters  where   areas   of\r\n\r\nambiguity are larger than what we have tolerated  in\r\n\r\nthe  past.  In the area of economic development,  so\r\n\r\nmany  inputs  are  quantifiable.  In  the  area   of\r\n\r\ndevelopment   of   nationhood  -  there   are   many\r\n\r\nimponderables.  But  there are indicators  which  we\r\n\r\nmay  take as possibly lighting up the path we  might\r\n\r\nfollow.  For  example, we should try  in  every  way\r\n\r\npossible  and  as  repeatedly as  possible  to  draw\r\n\r\nattention   to   significant  common  and   familiar\r\n\r\nthings,  multiplying  (so  to  speak)  occasions  of\r\n\r\ncommon   reference.  What  are  these   common   and\r\n\r\nfamiliar  reference  points?  For  one,  there   are\r\n\r\nplaces  and  people. In some cities,  walking  along\r\n\r\nsightseeing,  one comes across a small  monument  or\r\n\r\neven   a   plaque  which  tells  of  a   significant\r\n\r\nhappening  connected with the place commemorated  in\r\n\r\nsuch   a   simple   way.  Recently  I   incidentally\r\n\r\nsuggested  to  the  Minister for  Culture  that  the Victoria  Memorial  Hall could be restructured  into quite a good concert hall. He jokingly replied  that\r\n\r\nwe  should  not  change -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> It was solemn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Seriously or jokingly, well, maybe he\r\n\r\nwill  tell  us  later. He jokingly  replied  that  we\r\n\r\nshould  not  change  the shape  of  such  a  national\r\n\r\nmonument  as  it  was there that  the  PAP  held  its\r\n\r\ninaugural meeting and thus saw its coming into being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may happen that one day the people of\r\n\r\nSingapore   may   want  to  commemorate   the   PAP's\r\n\r\ncontribution to Singapore's construction - be that as\r\n\r\nit  may,  there are many places and events  which  it\r\n\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuseful to commend to the attention and memory of  the\r\n\r\npeople, in a more thoughtful way - in such a  way  as\r\n\r\nto  make the people realise that there is much in our\r\n\r\npast to remember and ponder over. The Monuments Board\r\n\r\nshould be given every support if it can help in  this\r\n\r\ntask.  But  I can recall off-hand one or  two  places\r\n\r\nlike,  for example, the location in Bukit Timah where\r\n\r\nour  own  boys, already Singaporeans, gave  up  their\r\n\r\nlives defending this sector against the Japanese when\r\n\r\nthey  invaded Singapore. Other places may  relate  to\r\n\r\nrecollections  of  cultural  or  earlier   historical\r\n\r\nsignificance.  Both  where  people  and  places   are\r\n\r\nconcerned,  the  Member for Ulu  Pandan  has  already\r\n\r\nrecommended  the kind of references  we  should  make\r\n\r\nthose  in  our  schools familiar with.  But  I  think\r\n\r\nprogrammes interestingly produced for the mass  media\r\n\r\nshould be considered for the general education of our\r\n\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also consider the record of events that\r\n\r\nhave   occurred  more  recently.  As   the   Foreign Minister  has pointed out last week in  this  House,\r\n\r\nthe  revelations  we have been given  regarding  the\r\n\r\nlatest  black operations should be seen as  salutary\r\n\r\neducation  for our own people and for ourselves.  We\r\n\r\ncan  see  more and more how the communists  operate.\r\n\r\nThis  is what is happening today. But our leadership\r\n\r\nhave  been  involved in the fight for  the  span  of\r\n\r\nabout  a  generation.  Their  experience  should  be\r\n\r\nrecorded and made more widely known. How many  know,\r\n\r\nto  refer only to one example, what an exciting  and\r\n\r\ninteresting  story  our  Minister  for  Culture  can\r\n\r\ntell. I have been having some conversation with  him\r\n\r\na  little bit more frequently recently, Sir. What an\r\n\r\nexciting  and  interesting story  our  Minister  for\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture can tell about his involvement as a\r\n\r\ncommunist  activist for a period until  he  - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Underground!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> - on his own accord, broke away from\r\n\r\nthe  communists. [interruption] Yes, he is organising\r\n\r\nthe  thing  right now! Our Deputy Prime Minister  has\r\n\r\nannounced that he would be personally involved in the\r\n\r\nstructure  of a course for senior commanders  in  the\r\n\r\nSAF on\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarxism/Leninism, The Defence Minister  also  pointed\r\n\r\nout  that the general public seemed ignorant of  what\r\n\r\nreally  happened between 1954 and 1963 and  that  the\r\n\r\nfight in which the PAP was involved did not end in an\r\n\r\neasy  knockout victory over the communists,  I  think\r\n\r\nthat  a record of these stirring happenings depicting\r\n\r\nthe  actual condition of the life and death  struggle\r\n\r\nshould  be made much more widely known. Every  device\r\n\r\nshould  be  used to facilitate the recording  through\r\n\r\noral  history  interviews, assistance given  for  the\r\n\r\nrecording  of memoirs; and the means of dissemination\r\n\r\nshould  also  employ the different arts of  the  mass\r\n\r\nmedia.  In  as  much  as  the  course  for  the   SAF\r\n\r\ncommanders  is  not  a  propaganda  or  brain-washing\r\n\r\nsession,   so   also   should   these   records   and\r\n\r\nrecollections  not be regarded merely  as  propaganda\r\n\r\nand   brain-washing  but  a  serious  and   necessary\r\n\r\nendeavour to hand over from one generation to another\r\n\r\nthe   results  of  a  vital,  social  and  historical\r\n\r\nexperience,  When  we  think of the  oft-referred  to\r\n\r\nburden  of  the  present  leadership  of  finding   a\r\n\r\nsuccessor  government worthy of its responsibilities,\r\n\r\nthe   development  of  public  awareness  and  public\r\n\r\nresponsibility could contribute significantly to  the\r\n\r\nsolution of this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from these very vital means of providing a\r\n\r\ncommon  testament  to people, and other  measures  to\r\n\r\nrelate their thoughts constantly to common references\r\n\r\nas I have indicated, there are still other sources of\r\n\r\ncommon  references  which  are  seemingly  trite  but\r\n\r\nimportant  all  the same. It has been said  that  the\r\n\r\nproper  means of increasing the love we bear  to  our\r\n\r\nnative  country is to reside some time in  a  foreign\r\n\r\none.  Then  you  really miss the familiar  things  or\r\n\r\noccasions of common reference. Sir, one of the things\r\n\r\npeople  miss, however trite this may sound, is  food.\r\n\r\nNapoleon is alleged to have said that an army marches\r\n\r\non  its  stomach. In my younger days -  I  was  young\r\n\r\nonce,  Sir  -  I  used  to overhear  elderly  matrons\r\n\r\nadvising  young women about to get married  that  the\r\n\r\nway  to  a  man's heart was through his  stomach  The\r\n\r\ninterest  of  the Singaporean in food is proven  many\r\n\r\ntimes over by the number of hawker centres we have on\r\n\r\nour island and by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndebates  on  hawker licences that  we  have  in  this\r\n\r\nHouse.  It  may  not be such a quaint idea  to  focus\r\n\r\nattention  on some very idiosyncratic culinary  items\r\n\r\nthat  we find in Singapore. One type of cooking  that\r\n\r\nparticular  attention could be drawn to  for  special\r\n\r\nreasons  is  the  style of cooking of  the  peranakan\r\n\r\nChinese.   The   special  quality  of  characteristic\r\n\r\nflavour   is   fast  being  lost   because   of   the\r\n\r\ncommercialising in the sale of some  types  of  nonya\r\n\r\nfood. [Interruption] The question of moral influence\r\n\r\nhas  everything  to  do  with development,  Sir.  The\r\n\r\nStraits-born   Chinese,   Sir,   have   made    other\r\n\r\ncontributions  in  our history besides  the  culinary\r\n\r\none.  They  have  provided a  very  good  example  of\r\n\r\nadjustment   and   assimilation   into   the    local\r\n\r\nenvironment  while  retaining some  very  interesting\r\n\r\nChinese traditional ways. They spoke a kind of  Malay\r\n\r\nof  their own but they got married in the full  glory\r\n\r\nof traditional Chinese costume. It would be useful to\r\n\r\nrecall the history of the Chinese babas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reference point, Sir, is song. Somehow or\r\n\r\nother, very few of our modern compositions seem to me\r\n\r\nto  have the quality of universal appeal so far as we\r\n\r\ncan  make our songs a kind of common reference point.\r\n\r\nHow song can possess powerful evocative qualities  is\r\n\r\nindicated by the way the famous Terang Bulan has been\r\n\r\nmodified  and  turned into the Malaysian  anthem.  In\r\n\r\nSingapore there may be a number of traditional  well-known  tunes  -  but  perhaps well-known  in  musical\r\n\r\ncircles  only  - that we can revive and make  popular\r\n\r\nyet   another   source   of   common   reference   to\r\n\r\nSingaporeans.  Two  Malay  songs  come  to  my   mind\r\n\r\nimmediately.

There is another one which has got a march\r\n\r\ntempo and the first two lines run:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre>                           \r\n\r\n Tanjong Katong tepi laut\r\n\r\n Siapa suka boleh ikut.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon.

I\r\n\r\nremember attending a campfire at a Chinese school  in\r\n\r\nmy  constituency  and  observing  the  great  rapport\r\n\r\naroused by the singing of () - and the repeat verse in\r\n\r\nEnglish  \"The  more we are together\". It  showed  how\r\n\r\ncommon feeling could be generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, different people react differently\r\n\r\nwhen  the  subject of patriotism is brought  up.  The\r\n\r\nliberal    tends   to   feel   uncomfortable,    Some\r\n\r\nintellectuals get more excited over human rights  and\r\n\r\ninternationalism. However, I did not  notice,  in  my\r\n\r\nschool-days,  that  the British were  shy  about  our\r\n\r\nsinging \"There'll always be an England\" and \"Land  of\r\n\r\nHope  and Glory\". I can still remember the titles  of\r\n\r\n\"patriotic\" songs the Japanese made us sing \"Miyoto o-kaye-no\", \"Umi-no-tame nara\". Maybe the Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  was  old  enough to remember  these  things.\r\n\r\nToday,  countries  like China,  Japan,  North  Korea,\r\n\r\nRussia,  even  America - they are not  bashful  about\r\n\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cuba is a very extreme example of the stress on\r\n\r\ncommitment.  The  Castro regime  in  Cuba  was  quite\r\n\r\nwilling,  after  the  revolution,  to  allow  over  a\r\n\r\nquarter  of a million of the population to  leave  as\r\n\r\nrefugees  principally to the United States, in  order\r\n\r\nto maintain high revolutionary morale among those who\r\n\r\nremained.  This decision entailed the  loss  of  two-fifths  of  the country's stock of graduate  manpower\r\n\r\nand  about  a  fifth  of  its  stock  of  those  with\r\n\r\nsecondary  education. As many as 20% of  the  lawyers\r\n\r\nand  judges,  1  5%  of  professional  and  technical\r\n\r\nworkers, and 7% of managerial and office workers  of\r\n\r\nCuba  had  been registered as refugees in the  United\r\n\r\nStates between the years 1959 and 1962.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would imagine that Castro did this as much\r\n\r\nbecause he was a Cuban as because he was a communist.\r\n\r\nEven communism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n              \r\n\r\nhowever   internationalist   its   leaning,   becomes\r\n\r\nsubordinate  to  stronger feelings of nationalism.  I\r\n\r\nsay these things, Sir, merely to stress how important\r\n\r\nit  is for us to develop our own brand of patriotism,\r\n\r\nand  contrive in a more conscious way to bring  about\r\n\r\nthe  circumstances that can help us foster this sense\r\n\r\nof identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made references to those ideas which I think\r\n\r\nwill   help  us  develop  some  kind  of  roots   and\r\n\r\nstrengthen these roots - even considering the  ritual\r\n\r\nor  symbolic  effect  of song and  food.  Perhaps  we\r\n\r\nshould  even  think  of a common costume,  a  way  of\r\n\r\ndressing - much like MPs wear white on National Day. I\r\n\r\nsaw  our  Foreign Minister dressed one evening  in  a\r\n\r\nrather  unique jacket. These are difficult  areas  of\r\n\r\ndiscussion  that we have brought up, the areas  which\r\n\r\nthe Member for Khe Bong was not able to understand. I\r\n\r\nhope that what has been attempted as a kind of brain-storming  in Parliament will not be finally assessed,\r\n\r\nespecially  by  the  Member for Khe  Bong,  as  brain\r\n\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the area we should consider in trying to work\r\n\r\nout  a  sense of commitment in is a wide  area  -  it\r\n\r\nrelates to our whole way of life. If this way of life\r\n\r\nis  only concerned with what this budget is concerned\r\n\r\nabout  -  I  do  not think the Minister  for  Finance\r\n\r\nhimself intends it that way - then I think we will be\r\n\r\nthe  poorer. Perhaps it is this commitment that  will\r\n\r\nslow  down  the  progression  of  our  young  doctors\r\n\r\ntowards  being their own businessmen, will slow  down\r\n\r\nthe   progression  of  our  over-taxed   wage-earning\r\n\r\nexecutives towards the level of disincentive that  my\r\n\r\ngood  friend  the Member for Jalan Kayu referred  to,\r\n\r\neven slowing down the emigration that the Member  for\r\n\r\nAnson  has  referred to. I do not  believe,  as  some\r\n\r\npeople  do, that patriotism is out  of  place  in  a\r\n\r\nmodern  technological  and cultural  system.  In  our\r\n\r\nsituation, it is quite essential, because  it  simply\r\n\r\nmeans  getting one Singaporean to communicate  better\r\n\r\nwith  another,  feel more responsible  for  him,  and\r\n\r\ncooperate with him in greater harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to Sun Tzu.

I\r\n\r\nfill it in, Sir, [Applause].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.39 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Alexandra):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the\r\n\r\npublic  is  generally  quite happy  with  the  Budget\r\n\r\npresented by the Hon. Minister for Finance in that it\r\n\r\ncontains no shocks. Coming so soon after the  General\r\n\r\nElections, the concessions given by the Minister  and\r\n\r\nthe absence of new taxes must have come as a pleasant\r\n\r\nsurprise.  Only the smokers and drinkers are  feeling\r\n\r\nthe  pinch  this  time. But I think the  smokers  are\r\n\r\nsomewhat  confused as to whether the tax increase  on\r\n\r\ntobacco  is  intended purely as a  measure  to  raise\r\n\r\nadditional revenue or whether the Minister  seriously\r\n\r\nintends this increase to really discourage them  from\r\n\r\nindulging  in  the  habit. I do  not  think  the  tax\r\n\r\nincrease  which in effect amounts to five cents  more\r\n\r\nper  packet  of  cigarettes will put people  off  the\r\n\r\nhabit.  But  if at all the objective is to discourage\r\n\r\nwhat  is  a hazard to health, then I suggest that  in\r\n\r\nfuture  taxation be based on a system  whereby  taxes\r\n\r\nare proportionately raised according to the amount of\r\n\r\ntar  content  in cigarettes. It has been  established\r\n\r\nthat there is a correlation between the amount of tar\r\n\r\nin  cigarettes and the frequency with which  diseases\r\n\r\nof  the  lung occur. But if the objective of the  tax\r\n\r\nincrease is really to increase revenue, then  perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister should not attempt to sweeten  his  tax\r\n\r\nincrease with moral camouflage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Hear, hear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, although the Budget did not\r\n\r\ncontain  rude shocks, it must have come as  a  slight\r\n\r\ndisappointment to those who hope to gain  by  way  of\r\n\r\nmore  tax  concessions out of it.  Of  the  four  tax\r\n\r\nconcessions granted by the Hon. Minister,  only  one.\r\n\r\nthat  is the raising of the exemption limit on estate\r\n\r\nduty, has a direct benefit to many people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Minister to consider\r\n\r\nraising,  in  future,  the relief  allowed  for  life\r\n\r\ninsurance  premiums and CPF contributions. The  total\r\n\r\ndeduction  permissible  under  this  category  cannot\r\n\r\nexceed  $4,000  at  the moment.  This  has  put  many\r\n\r\npeople,   especially  those  in   the   middle-income\r\n\r\ncategory  who are executives or at middle  management\r\n\r\nlevels,  at  a  disadvantage. Their CPF contributions\r\n\r\nwould  take up most of the amount allocated,  leaving\r\n\r\nhardly  anything  left for deductions  for  insurance\r\n\r\npremiums. Assuming a person earns a salary of  $2,000\r\n\r\nper  month, and it is becoming quite common  nowadays\r\n\r\nfor   such   people  to  earn  such  a  salary,   CPF\r\n\r\ncontributions will then amount to $3,600 per year. If\r\n\r\nthere  are  bonuses  earned, then  CPF  contributions\r\n\r\ncould well total $4,000 or more per year, thus taking\r\n\r\nup  the  entire amount of relief one is entitled  to.\r\n\r\nThe  amount  of  premium one pays for life  insurance\r\n\r\ndepends on the capital sum secured on death from such\r\n\r\na  policy.  But  I  think I would  not  be  wrong  in\r\n\r\nsuggesting  that  a person in such  an  income  group\r\n\r\nwould  normally pay around $1,000 a year or  more  in\r\n\r\ninsurance  premiums  in order  to  get  a  reasonably\r\n\r\nattractive life insurance policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the hon. Member for Jalan Kayu, insurance is\r\n\r\nnot my profession. But I do know enough to believe in\r\n\r\ninsurance  and  I think Singapore is still  far  from\r\n\r\nbeing  an insurance-conscious society. It is  not  my\r\n\r\npurpose to delve into the benefits of life insurance,\r\n\r\nbut  I think if we are to encourage people to provide\r\n\r\nfor the beloved ones that they leave behind when they\r\n\r\ndepart from this world or at least to tide them  over\r\n\r\na difficult period and I think it is not unreasonable\r\n\r\nfor  us to encourage people to do so, then some  form\r\n\r\nof  immediate  attraction to purchase life  insurance\r\n\r\nmust be provided for. Raising the limit on relief for\r\n\r\nlife insurance and CPF to $6,000 per year would serve\r\n\r\nas  an  incentive for many people who  are  presently\r\n\r\ndeterred from purchasing life insurance policies. The\r\n\r\nneed  to  raise this limit is also the more necessary\r\n\r\nin  view of the fact that compulsory contributions to\r\n\r\nthe  CPF  has been steadily increasing over the  past\r\n\r\nfew years, leaving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nless  and  less in the amount of relief for insurance\r\n\r\npremiums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I welcome the Hon. Minister's call to\r\n\r\nexporters to develop new markets. Our exporters often\r\n\r\nface problems of making new contacts. Their potential\r\n\r\ncustomers in various markets are already buying  from\r\n\r\nother sources. Customers see no point in buying  from\r\n\r\na  new source unless better terms are available or if\r\n\r\nthey  can get something which their present suppliers\r\n\r\ncannot provide. I am appreciative of the work done by\r\n\r\nour  commercial secretaries abroad and the Department\r\n\r\nof  Trade  here in Singapore in promoting  Singapore-made  goods.  But  I  have found that  many  contacts\r\n\r\nintroduced  to  our manufacturers do not  materialise\r\n\r\ninto  business because there is no follow-up  action.\r\n\r\nOften the initial contact ends up with the sending of\r\n\r\nsamples.  No  orders  follow. The manufacturer  loses\r\n\r\nheart,  not  realising it takes time to inculcate  in\r\n\r\nthe   potential  customer  sufficient  faith  in  the\r\n\r\nSingapore  product  and to build a relationship  that\r\n\r\nwould materialise in business deals. To achieve  more\r\n\r\npositive  results, we should quickly set up permanent\r\n\r\nexhibition centres in the main European, American and\r\n\r\nAsian cities where Singapore products could be put on\r\n\r\npermanent display. Another form of promotion would be\r\n\r\nfor  Singapore  to participate in all  the  important\r\n\r\ntrade fairs. But participation in international trade\r\n\r\nfairs  is an expensive thing. The participant has  to\r\n\r\npay   for  rental  of  space  which  is  often   very\r\n\r\nexorbitant, travelling expenses, shipping merchandise\r\n\r\nto the fair, etc. In other words, it would cost quite\r\n\r\na sum for a manufacturer to participate in such fairs\r\n\r\nand many of our small manufacturers cannot afford  to\r\n\r\ndo so. What the Government can do to help would be to\r\n\r\nhave  \"Made-in-Singapore\"  stands  at  all  important\r\n\r\ntrade   fairs   and  to  rent  space   out   to   our\r\n\r\nparticipating manufacturers at nominal  rates.  I  am\r\n\r\nsure  that  such a policy would attract more  of  our\r\n\r\nmanufacturers, particularly  the  small   ones,   to\r\n\r\nparticipate in international trade fairs at a reduced\r\n\r\ncost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On going through the Estimates, I noticed a small\r\n\r\nitem - excise duty at $15.1 million\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nto  be  collected from locally refined sugar. I would\r\n\r\nlike to ask the Minister the reason for imposing this\r\n\r\nexcise,  and in view of the fact that this excise  is\r\n\r\nbeing passed on to consumers ultimately and the  fact\r\n\r\nthat  sugar  is  a  basic  necessity,  would  he  not\r\n\r\nconsider abolishing this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last point relates to a complaint which was\r\n\r\nraised  by  me  during the debate on the Presidential\r\n\r\naddress  on the case of a family asked to return  the\r\n\r\n13th  month allowance already paid to an employee  of\r\n\r\nthe  HDB who died just before the end of the year.  I\r\n\r\nam  glad to read that the HDB has said that there  is\r\n\r\nno  legal  basis to claim against the family  of  the\r\n\r\ndeceased  and that it will not make a further  claim.\r\n\r\nHowever, I read only a few days ago the similar  case\r\n\r\nof  another statutory body asking back, not just  for\r\n\r\nthe 13th month allowance already paid to somebody who\r\n\r\ndied  after receiving it, but even the return of  one\r\n\r\nday's  pay. This time the culprit is none other  than\r\n\r\nthe  Telecommunication Authority of Singapore. I hope\r\n\r\nthe  TAS is not competing with the HDB and trying  to\r\n\r\noutdo it. But the TAS has today replied to criticisms\r\n\r\n14th March, 1977:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"When the widow of Enche Sardek bin Arip approached\r\n\r\nTelecoms  (via her relative) that she was  unable  to\r\n\r\nrepay  the  sum, the officer in charge  of  the  case\r\n\r\nassured her that she could take her time to repay the\r\n\r\namount.  He  added that she could make an  appeal  to\r\n\r\nTelecoms  which  will likely consider  the  case,  on\r\n\r\nsympathetic and compassionate grounds, to  waive  the\r\n\r\nrefund.  Subsequently. Telecoms decided to waive  the\r\n\r\nrefund  of one day's pay, and initiated a request  to\r\n\r\nthe  Ministry of Finance to waive the refund  of  the\r\n\r\n13th month allowance. This matter is being considered\r\n\r\nby the Ministry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot accept the TAS reply that they have\r\n\r\nmade  a  request to the Ministry of Finance to  waive\r\n\r\nthe  refund  of the 13th month allowance. Of  course,\r\n\r\nthere  are  rules which have been laid  down  in  the\r\n\r\nbeginning. Perhaps those who drafted the rules  never\r\n\r\nsaw  the  possibilities of such situations  but  they\r\n\r\ncannot  ask for a refund from somebody who is already\r\n\r\ndead.  They  cannot  ask from  the  deceased's  widow\r\n\r\nbecause, strictly speaking, she did not receive  the\r\n\r\nmoney. So why persecute the poor widow and her family\r\n\r\nat a time when they have already\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nenough  problems and agony? The TAS says that it  has\r\n\r\nno  authority to waive the refund of the  13th  month\r\n\r\nallowance. May I say. Sir, that the TAS in the  first\r\n\r\nplace  has no right whatsoever to ask for the refund.\r\n\r\nBut  what sickens me most is the TAS's claim  of  one\r\n\r\nday's  salary  from the widow. Even  though  the  TAS\r\n\r\neventually decided to waive the refund of  one  day's\r\n\r\npay,  just imagine the shock and the anguish the poor\r\n\r\nwidow must have suffered when she was first asked  to\r\n\r\npay  back the one day's salary. Sir,I can only think\r\n\r\nof  one  word  to describe the TAS approach  to  this\r\n\r\nmatter  -  cruelty.  Even  if  the  TAS  subsequently\r\n\r\ndecided to waive the refund of one day's salary,  the\r\n\r\ndamage has already been done. If it is a question  of\r\n\r\nrules.  I  urge the Minister to quickly take measures\r\n\r\nto  amend  the  present rules. It is  very  sad  that\r\n\r\ninsistence on rules being followed to the letter  has\r\n\r\nresulted in very unfortunate situations. It  is  time\r\n\r\nthat we put the human element into the interpretation\r\n\r\nof  rigid  rules and where the rules  really  tie  us\r\n\r\ndown, then change the rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.50 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  join my colleagues in congratulating\r\n\r\nthe  Hon.

I  am\r\n\r\nconfident  we  can achieve the same growth  rate  for\r\n\r\n1977  if we continue with our tripartite cooperation.\r\n\r\nGovernment will do its best to maintain political and\r\n\r\neconomic  stability,  employers  will  expand   their\r\n\r\nindustries  and workers will work harder to  increase\r\n\r\nproductivity.  I  fully agree with the  Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance  that we must continue to press on  with  our\r\n\r\npromotion  efforts  in the United States,  Japan  and\r\n\r\nWestern  Europe and to maintain a healthy  investment\r\n\r\nclimate  on the home-front. Also, we have to  explore\r\n\r\nnew markets especially in West Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the five major ASEAN industrial\r\n\r\nprojects  will  be implemented as soon  as  possible.\r\n\r\nThese  five industrial projects will certainly  boost\r\n\r\nup the economic and industrial growth in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the proposal made by the hon.\r\n\r\nMember  for Leng Kee that ASEAN should form a  united\r\n\r\nfront  in dealing with United States, Japan  and  the\r\n\r\nEEC  countries in matters relating to tariff and non-tariff  barriers. I also agree with  him  that  ASEAN\r\n\r\nshould put pressure on Japan especially when she  has\r\n\r\nbeen  enjoying a huge surplus in trade with ASEAN.  I\r\n\r\nhope the Japanese Government leaders and the Japanese\r\n\r\nbusiness tycoons will stop their selfish, greedy  and\r\n\r\nugly  exploitation of the economic situation in  this\r\n\r\nregion. It is a matter of time for the United States,\r\n\r\nEurope,  ASEAN  and  other  developing  countries  to\r\n\r\nimitate  the Japanese style and strategy in  business\r\n\r\ndealings and trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ASEAN decides to stop exporting rubber, tin,\r\n\r\noil, timber and other raw materials to Japan, and  to\r\n\r\nfind other markets, it will not be easy for Japan  to\r\n\r\nget  similar supplies at such fair prices.  In  World\r\n\r\nWar   II,  Japan  was  not  successful  in  achieving\r\n\r\nmilitary  and  territorial  domination.  However,  at\r\n\r\npresent  Japan has been quite successful in  economic\r\n\r\nexploitation  and  domination,  which  is  as  deadly\r\n\r\ndangerous as military and territorial domination,  We\r\n\r\nhave to watch the situation closely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that the best way to deal with\r\n\r\nJapan, United States and Europe is for ASEAN to  form\r\n\r\nan  ASEAN  Common Market like the EEC countries.  The\r\n\r\nsooner we form it, the better for our ASEAN Economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us remember the proverb: \"Heaven helps\r\n\r\nthose  that  help themselves\". We should  accept  the\r\n\r\nfact that the world does not owe us a living. We have\r\n\r\nto struggle, sweat, toil, work harder, do our best in\r\n\r\nwhatever way we can, so that our people in ASEAN  can\r\n\r\nlive  a healthy and happy life with a better standard\r\n\r\nof   living   through  mutual  self-reliance,   self-discipline and self-help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I join my colleagues in supporting the Budget\r\n\r\nStatement  presented by the Minister for  Finance  to\r\n\r\nthis House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>5.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Mansor Haji Sukaimi:</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I would like to begin  with  a  small\r\n\r\ndiversion,  as  I wish to first pay  tribute  to  our\r\n\r\nnational  soccer players who were beaten  one-nil  in\r\n\r\nthe  just concluded pre-World Cup tournament  at  our\r\n\r\nNational  Stadium. These were the same men  who  were\r\n\r\ndismissed   as   no-hopers   after   their   alarming\r\n\r\ninadequacies   in   friendly   matches   before   the\r\n\r\ntournament. And even the anxiety of soccer  fans  had\r\n\r\nappeared to threaten their confidence. That they were\r\n\r\nable  to  lift their game to an altogether  different\r\n\r\ndimension underlined their resilience and indomitable\r\n\r\nspirit.   They  have,  indeed,  surpassed   all   our\r\n\r\nexpectations. And isn't this capacity  to  thrive  in\r\n\r\nadversity so typical of we Singaporeans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not very long ago that our future was\r\n\r\nwritten   off   by  many  when  we  were  discharged.\r\n\r\nunexpectedly, from the Malaysian Federation. And more\r\n\r\nrecently we were viewed by many outsiders with morbid\r\n\r\nfascination as condemned people after the pullout  of\r\n\r\nthe  British bases. But we snapped back with the same\r\n\r\ntenacity  and  resolute will and emerged  from  those\r\n\r\nmoments with greater glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our footballers have displayed that same grit, that\r\n\r\nsame  inner  strength. And I salute  them  for  their\r\n\r\ndetermination and sacrifices; their wives  for  their\r\n\r\nunderstanding during those many lonely hours, and the\r\n\r\nFAS  officials for a job well done. I wish them  well\r\n\r\nin all their future endeavours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listening to the learned views and excellent\r\n\r\npresentations of hon. Members who spoke before me,  I\r\n\r\ncannot  but feel convinced that the Minister and  his\r\n\r\nofficials have indeed done a great job in formulating\r\n\r\nan  excellent programme to ensure that  our  Ship  of\r\n\r\nState  will  always be resilient  and,  as  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMinister says, be \"steady as she goes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I was very happy to find that my reaction\r\n\r\nto  the  Minister's Budget speech reflects  the  same\r\n\r\ntenor  and spirit expressed by the Member for Katong,\r\n\r\nbut,  of  course, the Member for Katong has expressed\r\n\r\nthis feature of the policy in a much lucid manner and\r\n\r\nin his typical, classic and fine literary style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would not want to over-emphasise as he\r\n\r\ndid  the  element of compassion. By this,  I  do  not\r\n\r\nreally  mean, Sir, that the Minister is  not  a  kind\r\n\r\nman.  I  prefer instead to call him a judicious  man;\r\n\r\njudicious  because  his thinking, his  assessment  of\r\n\r\nthings,  his  assessment  of our  economic  situation\r\n\r\ntells him that Singapore can afford to have what many\r\n\r\nMembers  say \"a painless Budget\". This point must  be\r\n\r\nseen  in  this light because if his abacus tells  him\r\n\r\nthat  next  year the Budget will be a stringent  one,\r\n\r\nthen  surely it is not fair for us to call  the  hon.\r\n\r\nMinister an unkind man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to congratulate the silent backroom\r\n\r\nboys  who  have  given  the Minister  such  excellent\r\n\r\nsupport.  I am sure the task of gathering  the  data,\r\n\r\nanalysing   them   and   formulating   the   multiple\r\n\r\npermutations of alternative strategies must call  for\r\n\r\nthe most analytical minds, strong perseverance and  a\r\n\r\ndeep  belief that something positive can be  done  to\r\n\r\npromote the prosperity of our Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister's assessments of 1976 and the\r\n\r\nprospects  for  1977  are  indeed  realistic.  He  is\r\n\r\ncautious, yet refreshingly optimistic. His review  of\r\n\r\nthe   status  of  the  Economic  Strategy   Programme\r\n\r\nannounced   five  years  ago  gives  us  a   succinct\r\n\r\nrecollection  of the rationale and direction  of  our\r\n\r\neconomic developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank him for reminding us that the central\r\n\r\nobjective  of our programme he announced  five  years\r\n\r\nago   is   to  modernise  and  transform  Singapore's\r\n\r\neconomic structure so that it would become a  `brain'\r\n\r\nservices  centre.  In  a nutshell,  he  has  kept  us\r\n\r\ninformed  of  the progress of the package  of  public\r\n\r\npolicies designed to fulfil the five basic programmes\r\n\r\nin  manpower  development,  science  and  technology,\r\n\r\ninfrastructure developments, taxation, and promotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, this review is crucial. We need to be\r\n\r\nalways conscious of our economic chart-ways. We  must\r\n\r\nalso know how each step we make not only consolidates\r\n\r\nwhat we have achieved but also paves the way for  the\r\n\r\nnext step,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `tactics' for 1977 he offers us again reflects\r\n\r\nhis  meticulous  thought-process as a tactician.  For\r\n\r\nIndustrial  Development, he urges that  we  press  on\r\n\r\nwith  greater  promotion efforts  especially  in  the\r\n\r\nUnited  States, Japan and Western Europe - and  these\r\n\r\nare indeed the crucial sectors. On the home front, he\r\n\r\nadvises  us to maintain a healthy investment  climate\r\n\r\nand  do  what  we can to keep major production  costs\r\n\r\nstable, and  industrial  facilities  and   services\r\n\r\nreadily   available   for   investors.   For    Trade\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  I see the importance of  the  need  for\r\n\r\ngovernment and traders to work more closely  together\r\n\r\nand  for  us  to  strengthen  and  expand  our  trade\r\n\r\ncontacts  and  promotion efforts overseas.  The  same\r\n\r\nmeticulous thought process is also reflected  in  his\r\n\r\nformulations   on  Asean  Economic  Cooperation   and\r\n\r\nServices  Development. On Wages Policy  and  Manpower\r\n\r\nDevelopment, the  Minister  has  propounded  what  I\r\n\r\nconsider are very crucial principles so necessary  to\r\n\r\nhelp us sustain a healthy and more meaningful climate\r\n\r\nin industrial relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While urging workers to put in their best efforts,\r\n\r\nthe Minister has reminded management, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....employers have an equal responsibility to improve\r\n\r\ntheir  management  of  personnel  or  of  plant   and\r\n\r\nmachinery to increase productivity. Employers  should\r\n\r\nconsider  the  introduction of appropriate  incentive\r\n\r\nschemes   to  reward  efficient  workers  for   their\r\n\r\nproductivity'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This commitment to productivity, as we all know, Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy Speaker, Sir, has been our standing policy. To\r\n\r\nlabour,  this  policy  imposes,  to  some  degree,  a\r\n\r\nconstraint  on wage increases. Nonetheless,  we  will\r\n\r\nhonour our commitment. Our workers will no doubt  put\r\n\r\nin their best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But management must also honour their commitment,\r\n\r\nIn  this  regard the Minister has very aptly  stated,\r\n\r\nand I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The initiative for formulating such (productivity)\r\n\r\nschemes is clearly their responsibility as they  have\r\n\r\nthe greater resources and experience in this area'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>This, to my mind, is critical. But unfortunately, the\r\n\r\nrecord  of management's efforts in this direction  is\r\n\r\ndismal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Manpower Development, the Minister has cautioned\r\n\r\nmanagement (and this emphasis is long overdue!) that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To instil correct work attitudes in our workers,\r\n\r\nemployers  must provide a proper working environment.\r\n\r\nGood  employers  usually have hardworking,  dedicated\r\n\r\nworkers'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>All  too  often,  too  many  workers  suffer  because\r\n\r\nmanagement has failed to realise the significance  of\r\n\r\nthis fundamental principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are too many instances (and this applies to\r\n\r\nthe  civil service as well) where management does not\r\n\r\nshow   enough  concern  in  ensuring  that  work   is\r\n\r\nsystematised; instructions given clearly;  legitimate\r\n\r\ngrievances  resolved conclusively. Nor do  they  seem\r\n\r\ninterested  to  consciously  look  for  talents   and\r\n\r\ndeveloping these talents in a positive way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, their view is excruciatingly negative.\r\n\r\nTake    disciplinary   procedures,    for    example.\r\n\r\nDisciplinary actions pressed by management  are  only\r\n\r\ninterested  in deciding the penalties to be  imposed.\r\n\r\nThey start with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  assumption that the workers are guilty  and  all\r\n\r\nmanagement  wants to do is to prove how more  serious\r\n\r\nthe  guilt  is - simply to justify the most stringent\r\n\r\npenalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This negative attitude must be rectified. Perhaps\r\n\r\nthe  Minister and also the Minister for Labour  could\r\n\r\ndesign appropriate measures and incorporate them into\r\n\r\nall  important administrative policies pertaining  to\r\n\r\nManpower  Development  and Management.  Whatever  the\r\n\r\ndetails,  management must be made to be more positive\r\n\r\nin  effecting work improvements. They must not assume\r\n\r\nthings. They must be more involved in the running  of\r\n\r\ntheir  organisation. They must make  it  a  habit  to\r\n\r\ncheck,  double-check  and see that  improvements  are\r\n\r\nimplemented, and implemented properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management officers, individually, must conduct\r\n\r\nthemselves in such a way as to honour the self-esteem\r\n\r\nof   workers   and  strive  to  afford  workers   the\r\n\r\nopportunity  to experience a sense of self-worth.  In\r\n\r\nall disciplinary proceedings, a fairer system must be\r\n\r\ninstituted.  Charges and reasons  for  these  charges\r\n\r\nmust  be  clearly  stated  and  communicated  to  the\r\n\r\nalleged  offenders - not vaguely or carelessly  as  is\r\n\r\noften  done. The principle of \"due process'  must  be\r\n\r\nguaranteed   and  the  worker  must  be   given   due\r\n\r\nopportunity  of being heard - not merely ratified  by\r\n\r\nlip-service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In every disciplinary proceedings, a mandatory\r\n\r\nassessment must be made to ascertain whether  or  not\r\n\r\nthere  are  any  flaws or deficiencies in  management\r\n\r\nwhich  have  led or contributed to the occurrence  of\r\n\r\nthe    offence,    indiscipline   or   unsatisfactory\r\n\r\nperformance.  If the offence was due to  management's\r\n\r\ndefault  or disinterest, then a more positive  action\r\n\r\nmust be taken on management officers responsible  for\r\n\r\nthe deficiencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that these precepts are non-existent in managements. Yes, they do exist. But\r\n\r\nmanagement tended to give them lip-service and  often\r\n\r\nfor their own\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconvenience. I say this because I know these precepts\r\n\r\nare  difficult  to implement, that is, if  management\r\n\r\nreally  wants to seriously upgrade themselves in  the\r\n\r\ndirection  urged  by  the hon. Minister.  But,  alas,\r\n\r\nthese improvements are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I am asked for any pointers which can help\r\n\r\nmanagement in realising these improvement measures, I\r\n\r\nwould suggest they take the cue from the Minister for\r\n\r\nFinance  who  in  his Budget policy has  so  strongly\r\n\r\nemphasized three principles: -\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Problems must be tackled with positive\r\n\r\ndynamism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Efforts must be charged with a deliberate\r\n\r\nintent to promote favourable circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) There must be regular reviews and therefore\r\n\r\nscope for flexibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see these three-pronged strategy of \"dynamism -\r\n\r\npromotion  - flexibility\" a crucial prerequisite  for\r\n\r\nimprovements. These must be cultivated, nurtured  and\r\n\r\nimbued  in  all our organisations, our civil  service\r\n\r\nand  our  life-styles. Without these, we will  wither\r\n\r\nand  that mysterious inner strength so typical of the\r\n\r\nSingapore  character will fail to come to our  rescue\r\n\r\nespecially during a crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This strategy of dynamism, promotion and\r\n\r\nflexibility  must particularly be instituted  in  our\r\n\r\ncivil  service. This is crucial as we are no more  in\r\n\r\nthe  colonial  era  where the  civil  service  was  a\r\n\r\ncloistered domain whose primary task was to  regulate\r\n\r\nand  control, rather than to promote  and  stimulate\r\n\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demands made by our society on the civil\r\n\r\nservice are numerous and exacting. It is required  to\r\n\r\nbe  incorrupt, efficient and effective.  It  must  be\r\n\r\nhumane and judicious. It is expected to be an abiding\r\n\r\nand  prompt executor. It must arbitrate and  regulate\r\n\r\nfairly  and,  most  importantly,  it  has  to  be  an\r\n\r\nuntiring  catalyst and innovative  developer.  It  is\r\n\r\ntrue that the civil service must run the machinery of\r\n\r\nGovernment and to run it well. It is also  true  that\r\n\r\nit  should not make mistakes, cause delays  or  waste\r\n\r\npublic  funds,  but  these are the minimum  standards\r\n\r\nexpected of all civil service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our ability to perform beyond this minimum\r\n\r\nlevel  that the Singapore civil service has  achieved\r\n\r\nthat  unique  position of being  the  most  efficient\r\n\r\ncivil  service in this part of the world.  To  ensure\r\n\r\nreal  success of the financial policy of  Government,\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service must continue to  be  innovative,\r\n\r\ndynamic and flexible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In formulating policies and implementing them, the\r\n\r\ncivil  service is expected to do so with  competence,\r\n\r\ndiligence  and  a  deep sense of responsibility.  Its\r\n\r\nmembers  are  expected to possess the  expertise  and\r\n\r\nimagination  to  appreciate problems and  to  propose\r\n\r\nrealistic solutions which should be implemented  with\r\n\r\nsufficient  perspicacity and thoroughness.  They  are\r\n\r\nalso  expected to be involved in assessing the merits\r\n\r\nof  policies rather than merely accepting  them  from\r\n\r\nthose  above  for implementation. Civil  servants  in\r\n\r\ntheir   respective  fields  should  demonstrate   the\r\n\r\ncapacity  for  expert  advice  and  to  do  so   with\r\n\r\nintegrity and conviction. These standards of  conduct\r\n\r\nand  performance  expected  of  the  Singapore  civil\r\n\r\nservice will be hard to compromise. They will  become\r\n\r\nmore  pronounced as the present political  leadership\r\n\r\nstrives  to  enhance the viability, prosperity,  and\r\n\r\nstability of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this end, there are certain critical\r\n\r\ncapabilities which must be developed within the Civil\r\n\r\nService.  Firstly, urgent attention must be given  to\r\n\r\ndevelop  a  larger pool of second echelon leaders  in\r\n\r\nthe  civil  service. At the moment, we  have  such  a\r\n\r\ndangerously  small  group of top  administrators  who\r\n\r\nhave  to burden so much, and, as a consequence, could\r\n\r\nnot  have  the disposition to develop the second-line\r\n\r\nresources in a positive manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, new working structures must be\r\n\r\ninstitutionalised. I agree fully with the hon. Member\r\n\r\nfor  Kallang  when  he urged that  more  supra-status\r\n\r\nbodies  like  the  Economic Activation  Committee  be\r\n\r\nutilised.  This is necessary because the  process  of\r\n\r\ngovernance  is  more complex. More and  more  complex\r\n\r\nprogrammes  and projects are required and  all  these\r\n\r\ncall  for more sophisticated policies and machineries\r\n\r\nwhich must allow for better coordination, sharing of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexpertise, establishing   proper   priorities   and\r\n\r\nensuring concurrent developments of all sectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the Government to consider\r\n\r\nestablishing what may be called a special Task  Force\r\n\r\nconsisting  of a group of multi-disciplinary  experts\r\n\r\nwho, together, can be given short assignments to help\r\n\r\nMinistries which have persistent problems which  they\r\n\r\ncannot solve themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary role of this Task Force is to also\r\n\r\nbuild  up  the initiating capabilities in the  weaker\r\n\r\nMinistries.  Such  a Task Force may  include  two  or\r\n\r\nthree bright young officers who, having completed the\r\n\r\nassignments,  can  be assigned the responsibility  of\r\n\r\nimplementing  and  making permanent  the  improvement\r\n\r\nmeasures.  In  a way, this arrangement will  open  up\r\n\r\ngreater  opportunities  to develop  the  second  line\r\n\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I would like to urge that the Central\r\n\r\nAgencies  like  the  Public Service  Commission,  the\r\n\r\nBudget  Division, Audit Department, and the CPIB,  to\r\n\r\ndrastically change their essentially centralised  and\r\n\r\nauthoritative postures into one which is more dynamic\r\n\r\nand promotive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, Sir, the Public Service Commission is\r\n\r\nthe   final  authority  on  personnel  and   staffing\r\n\r\nmatters. I would like to see the Commission  and  its\r\n\r\nSecretariat   to   take  this  job  of   recruitment,\r\n\r\nemplacement,  promotion and staff  development  in  a\r\n\r\nmore  open and dynamic manner. It is ridiculous,  for\r\n\r\nexample,  for the Public Service Commission  to  take\r\n\r\nmore  than four months to recruit a temporary  clerk.\r\n\r\nNor  is  it  enough  for them  to  merely  blame  the\r\n\r\neducational  system,  university  and  colleges   for\r\n\r\nhaving failed to supply the necessary candidates  for\r\n\r\nimportant appointments in the civil service.  Nor  is\r\n\r\nit  correct for them to merely wash their  hands  and\r\n\r\nlament  that  the private sectors offer better  terms\r\n\r\nthan  what  the  civil  service  can.  More  positive\r\n\r\nmethods  of  attracting  better  candidates  must  be\r\n\r\nworked out. New methods of assessing candidates  must\r\n\r\nbe  introduced because the exclusive reliance on  the\r\n\r\ninterview methods is not only inadequate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut  indeed obsolete, especially for the higher grade\r\n\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the budget Office, it is true that they must\r\n\r\nhave real control in resource allocations. But surely\r\n\r\nthey  can  do  it  without unduly  inhibiting  urgent\r\n\r\nsector developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing of projects and issues pertaining to\r\n\r\nstaff  matters surely must be attended  to  promptly.\r\n\r\nWhen  disapproving  requests made by  departments,  I\r\n\r\nthink  Budget should make it a point to indicate  the\r\n\r\nreasons  for  the  rejection.  This  will  help   the\r\n\r\nMinistries  understand the thinking and rationale  of\r\n\r\nthe Budget's decision. No doubt there are problems of\r\n\r\nstaff shortages at Budget but something must be  done\r\n\r\npositively  about it as any failings  in  the  Budget\r\n\r\nOffice  will create more serious implications in  the\r\n\r\nsector developments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the auditors, I must say how much I appreciate\r\n\r\nthe  increasingly difficult jobs they have to  do  as\r\n\r\nthe  Government  machinery becomes  more  complex.  I\r\n\r\ntherefore wish to offer the Auditor-General  and  his\r\n\r\nstaff my deep concern. I wish them well and urge them\r\n\r\nto  be  patient in their work. However, I must remind\r\n\r\nthe  Auditor-General  and his staff  that  the  audit\r\n\r\nfunction,  or  rather the manner by which  the  audit\r\n\r\nfunction   has   been   carried   out,   has   rather\r\n\r\ninadvertently brought about that most infamous  label\r\n\r\nthat  the  Civil Service is over-cautious, rigid  and\r\n\r\nbureaucratic.  I  really do not  blame  the  officers\r\n\r\nresponsible in the control and utilisation of  public\r\n\r\nmonies to be cautious. With the auditors always ready\r\n\r\nto  pounce  on them, there is little option  but  for\r\n\r\nofficers to be rigid and cautious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent case where a junior clerk in the Income\r\n\r\nTax  Department could embezzle nearly $1  million  of\r\n\r\npublic  money  and remain undetected  for  nearly  40\r\n\r\nmonths  has  made me feel that something  serious  is\r\n\r\nwrong  with  the  audit system. It  is  pointless  to\r\n\r\nsolely blame the Approving Officers in the Income Tax\r\n\r\nDepartment for blindly signing the payment bills when\r\n\r\nthe auditors themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwho  are given copies of the Payment bills, could not\r\n\r\ndetect these errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why auditors take such a long\r\n\r\ntime  to  raise queries, often after a lapse of  many\r\n\r\nmonths from the date the errors were committed. It is\r\n\r\nreally  unfair  to  ask  an officer  to  explain  the\r\n\r\nmistakes  after a long lapse, because he may  not  be\r\n\r\nable to recall in detail the explanations which could\r\n\r\nreally justify the errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore urge the Auditor-General to\r\n\r\nseriously improve his department so that the auditors\r\n\r\ncan  take  remedial action promptly after the  errors\r\n\r\nare committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next the CPIB. The CPIB must continue to be\r\n\r\nstringent.  This must be so because  our  society  is\r\n\r\nmore  involved in developments where there is so much\r\n\r\navenue  for  malpractices and there  is  a  need  for\r\n\r\ngreater control. It must maintain high standards  as,\r\n\r\notherwise, our creditability will be threatened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the CPIB must ensure that their officers\r\n\r\ndo  not  make  their investigations  in  a  frivolous\r\n\r\nmanner  which often can cause undue inconvenience  to\r\n\r\nthe  departments, and unjustifiably bring unnecessary\r\n\r\nshame  to officers, thus lowering the morale  of  the\r\n\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, my appeal is that Central Agencies\r\n\r\nwhich  I  have  mentioned above must now  take  on  a\r\n\r\ngreater  role  as promoter, facilitator  and  dynamic\r\n\r\nagent   and  must  allow  for  sufficient  scope   of\r\n\r\nflexibility   rather   than  remaining   a   passive,\r\n\r\ndisinterested   authority.  This   change   must   be\r\n\r\ndeliberate  and  the Civil Service must  reflect  the\r\n\r\ntrue  spirit  of dynamism, promotion and  flexibility\r\n\r\npromulgated in the Hon. Minister's Budget policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally I would like to urge the Civil Service to\r\n\r\ntake  on  a  more  positive  view  to  the  criticism\r\n\r\ndirected  at  them - most forcefully  by  Members  of\r\n\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I feel that the criticisms which hon.\r\n\r\nMembers of this House have raised should make the job\r\n\r\nof  the civil servants easier because they would have\r\n\r\nthe added reason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand  argument to put up for a case to their  superior\r\n\r\nofficers  and  even  to  their Ministers  for  easier\r\n\r\nsupport and approval. This was my experience  when  I\r\n\r\nwas in the Civil Service. I welcome criticism because\r\n\r\nthings simply get done much faster when there is good\r\n\r\ncriticism,   especially   when   the   criticism   is\r\n\r\naccompanied   with  very  sensible   suggestions   or\r\n\r\nalternative solutions. In this context, I would  like\r\n\r\nto strongly urge my colleagues that whenever we raise\r\n\r\nany  particular criticism, we should also make  it  a\r\n\r\npoint to offer sensible solution,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.20 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would\r\n\r\nlike to congratulate the Minister for Finance for his\r\n\r\npainless  budget and for his confidence  demonstrated\r\n\r\nin  his deficit budgeting.

Member:</b> So do you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I have given up smoking. I would\r\n\r\nlike, however, to ask the Minister for Finance if  he\r\n\r\nis  willing to give us an assurance, in the light  of\r\n\r\nthe  confidence displayed in presenting  the  budget,\r\n\r\nthat  no  new  taxes  will  be  introduced  and  that\r\n\r\nexisting  taxes will not be raised during the  course\r\n\r\nof  the year. I ask this, Sir, because of late, there\r\n\r\nis  the  tendency  to present a painless  budget  but\r\n\r\nafter the electorate has been lulled into a sense  of\r\n\r\nsatisfaction and complacency, new taxes  are  imposed\r\n\r\nor  existing taxes raised for various reasons  during\r\n\r\nthe course of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with the indulgence of the\r\n\r\nHouse, may I raise once again a question which I have\r\n\r\nraised  before and which I am sure is of interest  to\r\n\r\nmost  of  us  in  Singapore. I  refer,  Sir,  to  the\r\n\r\npersonal  relief afforded to taxpayers.  Sir,  income\r\n\r\ntax  was introduced more than 25 years ago and  there\r\n\r\nhas been no increase in the personal relief of $2,000\r\n\r\nexcept  for  the relief of $1,000 allowed for  earned\r\n\r\nincome.  Despite representations made in  this  House\r\n\r\nyear after year, the Minister for Finance has brushed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\naside  all  arguments with the same old excuses.  His\r\n\r\nrefusal  to  increase  the stagnant  personal  relief\r\n\r\nbrings consolation to nobody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has given us three reasons\r\n\r\nfor refusing to increase personal relief. Firstly, he\r\n\r\nsays  that the Government will lose about $26 million\r\n\r\nin  revenue  a year, and that (I quote Hansard,  24th February, 1977):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenue performance in the last financial year\r\n\r\nand  in the coming year is not so strong as to permit\r\n\r\nan increase in such income tax relief, If such relief\r\n\r\nwere  to  be  increased, a new tax or an increase  in\r\n\r\nother taxes may have to be imposed to make up for the\r\n\r\nloss in revenue.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This appears to be an answer which he repeats year\r\n\r\nafter  year.  In  regard to the first observation,  I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to draw attention to the  fact  that  in\r\n\r\npresenting  his  budget  the  Minister  gave  us  the\r\n\r\nimpression that Singapore is financially sound. In  a\r\n\r\nbudget  of $5 billion, $26 million is a drop  in  the\r\n\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the second sentence in the quotation,\r\n\r\ndoes  the Minister imply that he is thus giving us  a\r\n\r\nguarantee that there will be no new taxes or increase\r\n\r\nin existing taxes during the current financial year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make one other observation in\r\n\r\nregard to this $26 million which undoubtedly is being\r\n\r\ncollected  from marginal tax payers, who  undoubtedly\r\n\r\nnumber  several thousands. In a previous  sitting  of\r\n\r\nParliament,   the   Minister   indicated   that   the\r\n\r\ncollection of taxes from hawkers was too tedious  and\r\n\r\ncumbersome,  as  it would entail a  large  number  of\r\n\r\nstaff and revenue would rather be small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I would like to enquire if it\r\n\r\nwould  not  be better to transfer the staff  who  are\r\n\r\ncollecting this meagre $26 million from thousands  of\r\n\r\nthe  lower  income group and let them concentrate  on\r\n\r\nthe  collection  of  income tax  from  those  earning\r\n\r\nhigher  incomes and from those who may be at  present\r\n\r\nevading income tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason the Minister has given is that\r\n\r\nwhile  the  cost of living has gone up,  so  has  per\r\n\r\ncapita  income,  which increased the ability  of  the\r\n\r\ntaxpayer to pay more tax. Of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncourse, it is evident that if a person earns a higher\r\n\r\nincome  he  has to pay higher income tax if  personal\r\n\r\nrelief  is  not increased. But what the Minister  has\r\n\r\napparently  omitted to consider and  mention  is  the\r\n\r\nfact  that although incomes have gone up so  has  the\r\n\r\ncost of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance sometime ago admitted that\r\n\r\nthe  Consumer  Price Index for the year  1973-74  has\r\n\r\ngone  up by nearly 25%. How many times would it  have\r\n\r\ngone  up since 1948? Thus, any increase in wages  has\r\n\r\nbeen consumed and nullified by rising prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason the Minister has given is that the\r\n\r\never-increasing public expenditure has to be borne by\r\n\r\nas  many  people  as possible and that  the  services\r\n\r\nprovided  by  the  Government must be  paid  for.  Of\r\n\r\ncourse,  nobody  expects the services  of  Government\r\n\r\nfree  of charge but surely some consideration can  be\r\n\r\ngiven to those in the lower income group, who in 1948\r\n\r\nwere  not  so  badly  off when prices  of  goods  and\r\n\r\nservices were lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an article in \"Socialism That Works, The\r\n\r\nSingapore Way\", Dr Goh Keng Swee, our former Minister\r\n\r\nfor  Finance,  stated that \"from 1959  to  1975,  the\r\n\r\nConsumer  Price Index increased by about  70%\".  What\r\n\r\nthen  would be the increase from 1948 -probably  well\r\n\r\nover  200%.  Thus whatever wage increases  the  lower\r\n\r\nincome group may have received have all been absorbed\r\n\r\nby rising prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should also be borne in mind that taxpayers'\r\n\r\nexpenses  have also increased, if he is  married  and\r\n\r\nhas   children.  The  allowances  for  his  wife  and\r\n\r\nchildren have not been increased since 1948,  despite\r\n\r\nrising  prices. Thus the end product of the  existing\r\n\r\ntax  pattern  means that although a man's  wages  may\r\n\r\nhave doubled or trebled since 1948, he is left poorer\r\n\r\nthan what he was in\r\n\r\n1948 despite our Republic's progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not that I am advocating a substantial\r\n\r\nreduction  in  the rate of income tax;  all  that  is\r\n\r\nbeing asked for is that cognisance be taken of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\nthe rising prices and the fact that they have reduced\r\n\r\nthe wage-earner's real income as opposed to his money\r\n\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.33 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Deputy\r\n\r\nSpeaker,  Sir,  I rise to join my colleagues  on  the\r\n\r\nBackbench in support of the Motion moved by the  Hon.\r\n\r\nMinister  for Finance. Several hon. Members  have  no\r\n\r\ndoubt contributed much to the debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have several things to say about the financial\r\n\r\npolicy  of FY 77, Let me first refer to the statement\r\n\r\nof the Minister that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We have laid a sound foundation for sustained\r\n\r\ngrowth  (6  - 8%) through the five basic elements  of\r\n\r\nour long term development strategy',\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Hopefully this prediction may come true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the EDB's efforts in attracting\r\n\r\ninvestment  commitments of $364.2  million  in  1976,\r\n\r\ncomparatively speaking, is I think a bit on  the  low\r\n\r\nside,  though I understand their difficulty. However,\r\n\r\nI  hope the EDB will spare no efforts in securing and\r\n\r\npromoting investment to Singapore especially  in  the\r\n\r\nfields  that  will bring us to a higher technological\r\n\r\nlevel  in  which  higher skills are required  of  our\r\n\r\nworkers;  thereby putting us on a better footing,  so\r\n\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I welcome the setting up of the\r\n\r\nCapital  Assistance  Scheme to  assist  in  financing\r\n\r\nsmaller   but  more  technology-oriented  industries.\r\n\r\nCoupled  with  this,  I would  like  to  see  greater\r\n\r\nefforts  made  in  export  promotion.  Several   hon.\r\n\r\nMembers  have  already mentioned of the  need  to  co\r\n\r\nordinate  these efforts, and I hope the Hon. Minister\r\n\r\nwill  no doubt look into this. Perhaps a unit  should\r\n\r\nalso  be  set  up  to  advise on marketing  as  well.\r\n\r\nSeveral   Members   have  also  mentioned   marketing\r\n\r\npromotion for manufactured products, but they do  not\r\n\r\nseem  to have any follow-ups. I suggest that  such  a\r\n\r\nunit  be  set  up. This unit could then map  out  the\r\n\r\nstrategy  of promoting our manufactured products  and\r\n\r\nalso  provide amongst other things related  services.\r\n\r\nPermanent  exhibition centres  are  of  help,  but  I\r\n\r\nbelieve there is nothing better than the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npersonal   touch.   The  example  of   the   Japanese\r\n\r\naggressiveness in this respect should  enable  us  to\r\n\r\nunderstand  why  the Japanese economic  recovery  has\r\n\r\nbeen  so  successful and rapid since  post  war.  Our\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate  over the last few years has  been  high\r\n\r\nalso.  We  have had growing prosperity over the  last\r\n\r\n17 1/2  years  under PAP rule. But I believe we  can  do\r\n\r\nbetter  if  we redouble our efforts in  view  of  the\r\n\r\nuncertainties   ahead  which  I  think   nobody   can\r\n\r\naccurately predict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I turn to ASEAN economic cooperation. I\r\n\r\nwould  like  to  urge the Hon. Minister  to  consider\r\n\r\nlaying  greater  emphasis on  bi-lateral  and  multi-lateral trading arrangements with ASEAN countries.  A\r\n\r\ngood start has already begun with the Philippines and\r\n\r\nThailand \"with the across-the-board reduction of  10%\r\n\r\nof  existing  tariffs  on all  products\".  These  bi-lateral  agreements  mean that  Preferential  Trading\r\n\r\nArrangements would eventually, I think,  bring  about\r\n\r\ngreater  benefits to ASEAN. The other ASEAN countries\r\n\r\nare  rich in natural resources whereas Singapore  has\r\n\r\nthe   necessary  infrastructure  and  other   related\r\n\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister mentioned\r\n\r\na  balance of $611 million from the expected revenue\r\n\r\nyield of $3,362 million of which no less than 41%  of\r\n\r\nsuch  revenue  comes  from  income  tax.  The  income\r\n\r\nreceipts will be $1,380 million, i.e, up 15% over  FY\r\n\r\n76, In fact, wage earners and others have helped much\r\n\r\nin  this contribution. But there are others who  seem\r\n\r\nto be untaxed. Several hon. Members have again raised\r\n\r\nthe  question of further tax incentives. They are  my\r\n\r\ngood  Friend,  the Member for Khe Bong  (formerly  of\r\n\r\nBras Basah), the Member for Alexandra and others, and\r\n\r\nI  hope their appeal this time will not fall on  deaf\r\n\r\nears. However, Sir, the hon. Minister in reply to  my\r\n\r\nplea  for such income tax reliefs stated the need  to\r\n\r\nhave  a  broader  base; but I do hope  that  he  will\r\n\r\nenlighten  this  House as to what other  measures  he\r\n\r\nproposes  to  take  against the  untaxed  to  further\r\n\r\nbroaden  this base. In my remarks on this. I  am  not\r\n\r\nreferring  only  to  the  specialised  unit  in   his\r\n\r\nMinistry alone. I leave this matter open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, Sir, whilst I compliment the\r\n\r\nHon.  Minister  and  his Ministry officials  for  the\r\n\r\nextra caution in ensuring actual expenditure incurred\r\n\r\nas  a  result  of savings, (I think hon. Members  can\r\n\r\nrefer  to the Financial Statement for the year 1/4/75\r\n\r\nto  31/3/76, Paper Cmd. 1 of 1977, pages 130-317,  to\r\n\r\ninfer  this) I would like to draw the Hon. Minister's\r\n\r\nattention  to  both the shortfalls and underestimated\r\n\r\nyields  in  revenue. On estimated and actual  revenue\r\n\r\nside  (in  page  127, Code 311-002, on  \"Interest  on\r\n\r\nInvestments\") the estimated revenue was $110 million\r\n\r\nwhereas  the  actual revenue came to $74.91  million,\r\n\r\nresulting  in a shortfall of $35.08 million.  I  must\r\n\r\nhasten   to  add,  Sir,  that  this  is,   in   fact,\r\n\r\nreclassified under Dividend - Other Investments, Code\r\n\r\n312-009.  Sir, the following item Code  312-001  on\r\n\r\n\"Dividend-Temasek Holdings\" the estimated  yield  was\r\n\r\nsupposed  to be $6 million and the actual  yield  was\r\n\r\n\"NIL\" simply because no dividend was declared. Before\r\n\r\nhon.  Members rush to a conclusion on these  remarks,\r\n\r\nmay  I  point  out that there are many  examples  of.\r\n\r\nthese  so-called \"more than estimated\".  These  vivid\r\n\r\nexamples  can  be  found  in  the  same  statement  I\r\n\r\nreferred to just now. I therefore leave my remarks on\r\n\r\nthis  matter  to  the  Hon.  Minister  and  his   top\r\n\r\nofficials in the Ministry to reflect on. Surely, I do\r\n\r\nnot  expect  hon.  Members to say \"those  responsible\r\n\r\nmust  be  very accurate in their projections\"  but  I\r\n\r\nmust say that the differences should not be too great\r\n\r\neither.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of course, I have studied the Report of the\r\n\r\nAuditor-General  for  the financial  year  1975-76,\r\n\r\nPaper  Cmd.  2  of 1977, concerning this  point.  For\r\n\r\nexample, on page 11 of the Report, Revenue Less  Than\r\n\r\nEstimated (paragraph 48) I quote:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Information received showed that the respective\r\n\r\ndepartment concerned was not in a position either  to\r\n\r\nanticipate the recurrence of actual revenue less than\r\n\r\nestimated  or  to adjust for more accurate  budgeting\r\n\r\nfor the financial year under review'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>Therefore, Sir, the Auditor-General's remarks on this\r\n\r\nshould not only be noted but also be looked into.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to touch on two aspects\r\n\r\nconcerning Industrial Training and Prices covered  in\r\n\r\nthe  Economic  Survey of Singapore  1976.  Under  the\r\n\r\nheading   \"Manpower  and  Wages\",  on  page   37,   I\r\n\r\nappreciate  that \"Industrial Training  was  conducted\r\n\r\nmainly in institutions and on-the-job.\" I have had on\r\n\r\nprevious  occasions  in the past suggested  a  scheme\r\n\r\n\"earn-whilst-you-learn\". I believe that learning  on-the-job and in the institutions concerned is one good\r\n\r\nthing;  but  I  submit  that  \"earn-whilst-you-learn\"\r\n\r\nwould certainly upgrade the skills of our workers and\r\n\r\nwill  also encourage the younger students. Therefore,\r\n\r\nsuch  a  scheme  should  be implemented  as  soon  as\r\n\r\npossible  if we are to encourage both the  young  and\r\n\r\nskilled  workers to sharpen their tools of trade  and\r\n\r\nthereby better, themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of Prices in page 42 under \"Local\r\n\r\nfarm products\", it states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Between February and September 1976, prices of pigs\r\n\r\nfell  by 18% owing to excess supply, despite attempts\r\n\r\nto export more live pigs'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>May  I say that the prices of pigs fell by more  than\r\n\r\n18%.  May I ask who made attempts to export more live\r\n\r\npigs  and  to  which countries? How  far  have  those\r\n\r\ndepartments  concerned assisted  in  stabilizing  the\r\n\r\nprice  of  pigs? Prices of local farm  products  will\r\n\r\ndecline  if the Finance Ministry continues  to  allow\r\n\r\nimport of frozen and canned farm products from  other\r\n\r\ncountries.  Therefore, it is difficult to  understand\r\n\r\nthe rationale behind all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement that \"fish prices were unusually\r\n\r\nhigher  at  the  beginning and end  of  the  year  on\r\n\r\naccount  of  a poorer catch and during the north-east\r\n\r\nmonsoon  period\" is understandable. What is important\r\n\r\nis  the  need  to develop and encourage  the  fishing\r\n\r\nindustry.  Although  the  Changi  Fisheries  Training\r\n\r\nSchool  has been closed down, it does not  mean  that\r\n\r\nall  is lost in the fishing industry. The Jurong Fish\r\n\r\nMarket  caters  for foreign as well as local  fishing\r\n\r\nvessels.  The  Kangkar Fish Market in my constituency\r\n\r\nhas more than a hundred otter trawlers and serves the\r\n\r\ninshore fishermen as well. No doubt they help towards\r\n\r\nthe growth rate It\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmay  be  negligible  in terms of  percentage  to  the\r\n\r\ngrowth rate but still a little goes a long way. May I\r\n\r\nsuggest to the hon. Finance Minister to look into the\r\n\r\nmatter  of  concluding bi-lateral  and  multi-lateral\r\n\r\nfishing  arrangements  with the  ASEAN  countries  to\r\n\r\nenable  fishing  in  the region's waters.  I  believe\r\n\r\nthere  is  an abundance of fish in the seas  of  this\r\n\r\nregion  and if such arrangements are concluded,  this\r\n\r\nwill be another benefit to ASEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, Sir, I would like to refer to\r\n\r\nthe  tax  concessions which encourage home ownership.\r\n\r\nThe increase from $50,000 to $100,000 exemption limit\r\n\r\nis  most  welcome. Also the raising of the  remission\r\n\r\nlimit  from  $230,000  to  $280,000  in  respect   of\r\n\r\nproperties  means  a  reduction  of  tax  under   the\r\n\r\nexisting   estate   duty  liability.   Hon.   Members\r\n\r\nespecially  of  the  Third Parliament  are  certainly\r\n\r\ngrateful  to  our  Hon.  Minister  for  Finance   for\r\n\r\ngranting such a concession as this matter has at last\r\n\r\nbeen well considered, For the benefit of some of  the\r\n\r\nnew  Members of Parliament, including my good Friend,\r\n\r\nthe Member for Changi, this matter was raised on many\r\n\r\noccasions in this House because many of us felt  that\r\n\r\nit  would  be too harsh to see families losing  their\r\n\r\nhouses  because of the burden of having to pay  heavy\r\n\r\nestate duties. Properties have gone up in value  over\r\n\r\nthe  last  few  years. Therefore, the  concession  on\r\n\r\nestate  duties was only given a couple of years  ago,\r\n\r\nup to $50,000. Today it is now raised to $100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> It is long overdue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> My good Friend, the Member for Khe\r\n\r\nBong,  says it is long overdue. I think it is  better\r\n\r\nlate  than never. Therefore, it is not a question  of\r\n\r\nthe  haves benefitting and the have-nots losing  out.\r\n\r\nNobody  loses  out  in this. It  is  a  matter  which\r\n\r\nenables owner-occupiers' families to continue to live\r\n\r\nin  their  own homes. Most of them save hard  to  buy\r\n\r\ntheir  houses, say, 10, 15 or 20 years ago  when  the\r\n\r\nprices  then were about 10 times lower than they  are\r\n\r\ntoday. Just to illustrate, a terrace house then might\r\n\r\ncost  anything between $10,000 to $15,000  depending\r\n\r\non the locality. Today it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncosts  about $100,000 or more. I am sure hon. Members\r\n\r\nin this House would not wish to see a family, because\r\n\r\nthey have to pay estate duty as such, sell away their\r\n\r\nowner-occupied  house  which  the  owner  himself  or\r\n\r\nherself left behind for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, several Members have pleaded with our Hon.\r\n\r\nFinance  Minister  in the past  to  consider  not  to\r\n\r\nimpose the estate duty on the owner-occupied house of\r\n\r\nthe family concerned. In any case, this concession is\r\n\r\nwell  received. But I certainly hope that  this  will\r\n\r\nnot bring about an escalation in property assessment,\r\n\r\nbecause this concession then becomes meaningless.  In\r\n\r\nthis  respect,  I share the view of  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nWhampoa, who unfortunately is not around, on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Motion of the Hon. Finance Minister has my\r\n\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.52 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> Sir, I would not\r\n\r\ndetain this House very much longer. Apropos of what I\r\n\r\nhad  raised  in the earlier debate on the President's\r\n\r\naddress, there are a few concrete cases bearing  upon\r\n\r\nthe  implementation of the policy of the Housing  and\r\n\r\nDevelopment Board that I would like to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> would recall that in 1975 we passed\r\n\r\nthe  Housing  and Development Board (Amendment)  Bill\r\n\r\nwhich  provided, among other things, that  the  Board\r\n\r\nmay  compulsorily acquire any flat,  house  or  other\r\n\r\nliving  accommodation,  if  the  owner  thereof,  his\r\n\r\nspouse  or any authorised occupier, has at  any  time\r\n\r\nacquired,  whether by operation of law or  otherwise,\r\n\r\nany  title  to or an estate or interest in any  other\r\n\r\nland.  Barring  dishonesty, all owners  who  obtained\r\n\r\nflats from the HDB did so because they qualified  for\r\n\r\ntheir  flats. At the time of acquisition, they  owned\r\n\r\nno  other house or flat. Since obtaining their  flat.\r\n\r\nhowever,  they  went  on to invest  in  other  landed\r\n\r\nproperties. The amending Act now empowers the HDB  to\r\n\r\nreacquire  the  HDB flats from such owners  who  have\r\n\r\ngone  on  to  acquire other property and  to  improve\r\n\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst one accepts the need for empowering the HDB\r\n\r\nto  reacquire the flats in special circumstances, the\r\n\r\nway  in  which  this power is used  in  practice  has\r\n\r\ncaused  hardship.  A few cases would  illustrate  the\r\n\r\ndifficulty. In the first case, an unmarried woman,  a\r\n\r\nSingapore citizen, qualifies for and is given  a  HDB\r\n\r\nflat.  She lives in it with her parents and  sisters,\r\n\r\nall   of  whom  are  permanent  residents  but   with\r\n\r\nMalaysian citizenship. In due time the owner  of  the\r\n\r\nflat marries and moves into the matrimonial house  of\r\n\r\nher husband. Because her husband owned his own house,\r\n\r\nthe woman was asked by the HDB to surrender her flat.\r\n\r\nThe woman is now unable to perform her filial duty to\r\n\r\nher parents who must leave the flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second case, an illiterate man qualifies for\r\n\r\na  HDB  flat  but purchases it in the name  of  his\r\n\r\neldest  son who has an English education. The  father\r\n\r\nprovides  the entire purchase price for the flat.  In\r\n\r\ndue  time  the eldest son gets married and  seeks  to\r\n\r\ntransfer the flat back to his father so that he,  the\r\n\r\nson,  could apply for his own flat, The HDB  says  he\r\n\r\ncould not do it under current policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third case, an unmarried son qualifies for\r\n\r\nand  buys a HDB flat and houses his parents, brothers\r\n\r\nand  sisters. He decides to get married but  proposes\r\n\r\nto  transfer  the  flat to his brother  so  that  his\r\n\r\nbrother  could  continue  to  look  after  his   aged\r\n\r\nparents. He further proposes to apply for a flat  for\r\n\r\nhimself and his wife. HDB says, \"Under current policy\r\n\r\nsuch transfers could not be entertained.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, instances could be multiplied to show how an\r\n\r\ninflexible   application  of   policy   resulted   in\r\n\r\ndispossessed  families, due  to  no  fault  of  these\r\n\r\nfamilies  but  due  only to changes  in  Government's\r\n\r\nhousing   policy.  It  would  serve   the   ends   of\r\n\r\nGovernment's  policy  if greater  discrimination  was\r\n\r\nshown in avoiding genuine hardship when the HDB  used\r\n\r\nits powers of acquisition of flats in given\r\n\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also join in the chorus of support for the\r\n\r\nMotion standing in the name of the Hon. Minister  for\r\n\r\nFinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>6.57 p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr\r\n\r\nDeputy  Speaker,  I  have  listened  with  deep   and\r\n\r\nabsorbing interest to all that hon. Members have said\r\n\r\ntoday  and on the last Budget day. I thank  them  for\r\n\r\ntheir general support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been very few critical comments but\r\n\r\nquite  a number of useful suggestions. Some of these,\r\n\r\nsuch   as  those  relating  to  Sun  Tzu  and   moral\r\n\r\ninfluence, food and cooking (the nyonya cooking)  and\r\n\r\nother matters, require consideration at the pace  and\r\n\r\ndeliberation appropriate to philosophy, poetry, songs\r\n\r\nand  cooking. I will therefore do so at  my  leisure.\r\n\r\nBut  at  the  slower  growth rate  that  we  are  now\r\n\r\nexperiencing,  maybe  a lot  of  us  will  have  more\r\n\r\nleisure   time!   Other  suggestions  are   sometimes\r\n\r\ncritical  of my own Ministry of Finance's  assessment\r\n\r\nof  the economic situation in Singapore and I propose\r\n\r\nto  spend  some time replying to them. I  have  taken\r\n\r\ncopious  notes and since I cannot expect  equal  time\r\n\r\nwith  all  the Members who have spoken, I propose  to\r\n\r\nconcentrate only on highlights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may take the economic strategy, first of all I\r\n\r\nwould like to make some general remarks on the nature\r\n\r\nof  the  Economic  Survey and the  planning  and  the\r\n\r\nprospects  for 1977. The assessments in  my  Economic\r\n\r\nSurvey and in the Budget Statement are, of course, to\r\n\r\nsome extent personal or departmental, and it is quite\r\n\r\npossible that economists in the business and academic\r\n\r\nsectors may have their own views. In fact, the wealth\r\n\r\nof  data  that has now been supplied in the  Economic\r\n\r\nSurvey   is   intended  to  induce  such   individual\r\n\r\nevaluations,  if necessary, even to the  devising  of\r\n\r\neconomic  models  from, say, banking  and  university\r\n\r\ncircles, of the economy of Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in considering the comments which have been made\r\n\r\nby,  say, the Member for Whampoa, I think it may well\r\n\r\nbe  that he would consider his own assessment of  the\r\n\r\nsituation as correct. For example, he commented  that\r\n\r\nthe  improvement  in  productivity  was  due  to  the\r\n\r\neconomy pulling out of recession. This, of course, is\r\n\r\na plausible\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexplanation, although my Ministry and I myself differ\r\n\r\nfrom such an assessment. In the shipbuilding and ship-repairing  industry, for example, there is  no  doubt\r\n\r\nthat the keener competition which has been due to the\r\n\r\nrecession  has  increased  the  productivity  in  the\r\n\r\nindustry's   attempt,  not  always   successful,   to\r\n\r\nmaintain their profit margins by getting rid  perhaps\r\n\r\nof  their  less  efficient workers and improving  the\r\n\r\nproductivity of the ones they retain,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other comments which he made on the\r\n\r\ndecline  in the construction sector and the need  for\r\n\r\nthe Ministry of Finance to have regard to this in the\r\n\r\nfuture.  Some  of  the  decline  in  private   sector\r\n\r\nconstruction has been due to the lack of demand,  for\r\n\r\nexample, there has been a certain glut in commercial\r\n\r\nbuildings,  and  it  would not be  possible  for  the\r\n\r\nGovernment to further stimulate commercial buildings.\r\n\r\nIn the hotel sector, of course, it would be something\r\n\r\nwhich we would encourage over the next few years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also comment on the private share of\r\n\r\nexpenditure  declining over the last one  year.  This\r\n\r\nhas  been due to the fact that because of the private\r\n\r\nsector's hesitation in capital expenditure the public\r\n\r\nsector  has  taken over much of the development  work\r\n\r\nand  has  consequently increased  its  share  of  the\r\n\r\nSingapore expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa has also made comments on\r\n\r\nexchange  rate policy, or the lack of a statement  in\r\n\r\nthe  Budget concerning such policy. The exchange rate\r\n\r\npolicy  has been constant over the last two years  or\r\n\r\nso.  Our efforts have been to maintain stability  and\r\n\r\nan   easy  money  policy, so  that  there  would  be\r\n\r\nsufficient   liquidity  in  the  banks   to   promote\r\n\r\ndevelopment  activities.  Perhaps  it  was  wrong  to\r\n\r\nassume that there was no need for special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that quarterly figures be\r\n\r\nincluded  in  the Economic Survey. Some  figures  are\r\n\r\navailable  of  the  kind of data we  present  in  the\r\n\r\nEconomic Survey, on a quarterly basis, but not in the\r\n\r\nfull  range or the accuracy of it. So it may be  some\r\n\r\ntime yet before we are ready to produce these\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nquarterly figures in the annual Economic Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now go on to trade policy which has been\r\n\r\nmentioned  by quite a number of Members. I think  the\r\n\r\nMember  for Jalan Kayu was the first to suggest  that\r\n\r\nthere  should  be  a  coordinating  body  for  export\r\n\r\npromotion.  Possibly a Trade Development Council  may\r\n\r\nbe  a solution to the problems which we are facing  -\r\n\r\nhow  to  coordinate the efforts of  the  Chambers  of\r\n\r\nCommerce,  the  Singapore Manufacturers'  Association\r\n\r\nand   our   own  Trade  Department  export  promotion\r\n\r\nefforts. So it is something which we are proposing to\r\n\r\ngive consideration to over the next few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next matter which has been raised related to\r\n\r\nASEAN  and  the development of activities  under  the\r\n\r\nASEAN  umbrella. I made a pretty short  statement  on\r\n\r\nASEAN  in  the  Budget Statement because  I  did  not\r\n\r\nconsider  that  at  this stage while  there  is  very\r\n\r\nconsiderable  ferment  and  activity  among  Economic\r\n\r\nMinisters and by the officials, that there  had  been\r\n\r\nsufficient  implementation  of  projects  to  make  a\r\n\r\nsignificant contribution to the economy in  1977.  It\r\n\r\nmay  be  that  in  1978 or 1979 the  effects  of  the\r\n\r\nAgreement on Preferential Trading Arrangements on the\r\n\r\nfive ASEAN industrial plants, or the arrangements for\r\n\r\nensuring  that  oil and rice would  be  available  in\r\n\r\ntimes of crisis, would bear sufficient fruit to  make\r\n\r\na considerable impact upon the Gross Domestic Product\r\n\r\nof  Singapore. At the moment, all we can say of ASEAN\r\n\r\nis  that it shows very considerable promise and  that\r\n\r\nwe will need to spend very much more time on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic strategy on manpower was a matter of\r\n\r\ninterest to very many MPs and the need for skills and\r\n\r\nproductivity  was generally appreciated.  One  Member\r\n\r\nsuggested  that  we  should  have  some  regard   for\r\n\r\nunskilled workers, In this respect we have  not  paid\r\n\r\nany particular attention to unskilled workers because\r\n\r\nthere  is  really a shortage of unskilled workers  in\r\n\r\ncertain   industries  like  construction  and   ship-repairing, where we have had to issue quite a  number\r\n\r\nof work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npermits. So if there is really a considerable  number\r\n\r\nof  unskilled  workers  willing  to  engage  in  less\r\n\r\nattractive jobs, there are already industries waiting\r\n\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the responsibilities of management for\r\n\r\ninstituting  productivity incentive  schemes,  I  was\r\n\r\nperhaps misunderstood, or the Member for Leng Kee had\r\n\r\nnot  read  the  first part of my Budget speech  which\r\n\r\nsaid  that  productivity incentive schemes  were  the\r\n\r\nresponsibility of management because they had greater\r\n\r\nresources  and experience in this area and  that  the\r\n\r\nrewards  for  productivity should  be  in  incentives\r\n\r\nwhich  are  to  be  accorded by the  management.  The\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan put this matter  right,\r\n\r\nbut I am not sure whether the Member for Leng Kee was\r\n\r\npresent when he said that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were very many other comments on elements in\r\n\r\neconomic tactics rather than strategy. The Member for\r\n\r\nJurong  was  properly concerned with the difficulties\r\n\r\nand  hardships  experienced by  his  constituents  in\r\n\r\nJurong.  There were comments by the Member for  Anson\r\n\r\non  tourism and brain centre developments. But I will\r\n\r\nnot  go  into these matters because these are  points\r\n\r\nwhich can be raised in the Committee of Supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were very many questions raised on income\r\n\r\ntax, personal  allowances, and  so  on.  I  think  I\r\n\r\nanswered  these questions during the  debate  on  the\r\n\r\nPresident's Speech and I do not think I need  now  go\r\n\r\ninto this matter in any detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Not very detailed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> The Member for Khe\r\n\r\nBong  was among those who raised this with some heat.\r\n\r\nAnd,  of course, I heard the Member for Marine Parade\r\n\r\nwho  came  up  with figures which he referred  to  as\r\n\r\nbeing  in a Table(See Appendix II, cols. 907-8) which he would present in Hansard.\r\n\r\nI look forward to reading this and to be impressed by\r\n\r\nthe figures which he has produced. All I need now say\r\n\r\nis  that I will examine these figures very carefully.\r\n\r\nI  suspect the increase of 6950% in tax liability for\r\n\r\nthe lower income group may have been\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndue to the fact that the tax base was very low. If it\r\n\r\nis  say, $1 then 6950% would be $69. In fact, if  you\r\n\r\nmove  from  zero  to $50, that does not  make  it  an\r\n\r\ninfinite increase in the tax. As I say, I will have a\r\n\r\nvery  close look at the figures which he has produced\r\n\r\nfor  the  Cases A. B and C. As for index  linkage.  I\r\n\r\nthink  this  is  a  matter  which  I  would  be  very\r\n\r\nreluctant to give any special consideration. I do not\r\n\r\nknow  whether this has been the accepted practice  in\r\n\r\nmany  other jurisdictions, and I am loathe to be  the\r\n\r\nfirst  to  start in Southeast Asia, if not, in  Asia.\r\n\r\nThere  was  the  question whether I could  spare  $26\r\n\r\nmillion. The answer is, I can spare it if I can  find\r\n\r\nit elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One comment made by the Member for Alexandra was\r\n\r\nthat  the tax on cigarettes and drink was not a  real\r\n\r\ndisincentive  to  smoking  and  drinking.  I  am,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, prepared to impose a much higher rate if that\r\n\r\nis  his  advice, and I would certainly  look  further\r\n\r\ninto this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing the Member for Changi, and until I\r\n\r\nheard the Member for Punggol just now, I thought that\r\n\r\nperhaps I had given, in vain, a concession on  estate\r\n\r\nduty which no one wanted. But I am glad that this  is\r\n\r\nappreciated in certain quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for an assurance asked by the Member for Khe\r\n\r\nBong  that  there  would  be  no  further  taxes   or\r\n\r\nincreases in the year, I think he knows by  now  that\r\n\r\nMinisters  of Finance never give assurances  of  this\r\n\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the question of civil servants. There\r\n\r\nwere  some comments on civil servants, and I am  glad\r\n\r\nthat the ex-civil servant, who is now the Member  for\r\n\r\nKampong  Kembangan, was here to hold up the flag  for\r\n\r\nthe  civil  servants. I listened with some regret  to\r\n\r\nthe  Member for Aljunied. I thought that while it  is\r\n\r\ntrue that civil servants can very often take care  of\r\n\r\nthemselves, it is not possible for them to do  so  in\r\n\r\nthis  House.  It  is  a matter for  regret  that  the\r\n\r\nperformance  of  the civil servants should  again  be\r\n\r\nraised for attack, as not all the suggestions of  the\r\n\r\nMember for Aljunied are invalid. In fact, the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsuggestion  for a rotation of staff  so  as  to  give\r\n\r\ncivil servants a very broad experience is entirely in\r\n\r\naccordance  with  the  policy,  if  not  always   the\r\n\r\npractice, of the Government and of the Civil Service.\r\n\r\nBut  I  think  he spoils the value of his suggestions\r\n\r\nand  comments by making quite unnecessary attacks  on\r\n\r\nthe civil servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of Ministers invariably listening to\r\n\r\ncivil  servants who have been in the Ministry  for  a\r\n\r\nvery   long  time  is  not  entirely  flattering   to\r\n\r\nMinisters.  We initiate the policy, and sometimes  we\r\n\r\neven try to implement it, and the civil servants take\r\n\r\ntheir  orders  from us. But I think  the  Member  for\r\n\r\nAljunied  contradicts himself in the next  breath  by\r\n\r\nsaying  also  that  the  civil  servants  fear  their\r\n\r\nsuperiors  and try all they can to please  them,  and\r\n\r\nthat  they  answer  letters  to  the  Press  promptly\r\n\r\nbecause  they  are afraid of coming  to  unfavourable\r\n\r\nnotice.  I  myself  consider  that  the  growth  that\r\n\r\nSingapore  has had over the last 18 years since  1959\r\n\r\nhas  been  due  not  only to the  Ministers  and, of\r\n\r\ncourse,  the Members of Parliament who represent  the\r\n\r\nPeople's Action Party -although they should be  given\r\n\r\nthe  credit which is their due, this growth has  also\r\n\r\nbeen  due  to  the  fact that  we  have  a  good  and\r\n\r\nefficient  Civil Service. Like all organisations,  of\r\n\r\ncourse, there is always room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were also some criticisms of them because\r\n\r\nthey  hold office in the boards of private or  public\r\n\r\ncompanies  and in statutory boards. Very often  these\r\n\r\nare  a  part of the duties of the Civil Service.  For\r\n\r\nexample, the CPF is a statutory board, but  it  is  a\r\n\r\npart, as much as any other function, of the Ministry\r\n\r\nof  Labour.  In the same way, some of the  industries\r\n\r\nwhich  the Ministry of National Development  has  set\r\n\r\nup,  like  Food Industries and so on, are really  for\r\n\r\ncarrying  out of the work of the Ministry of National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.  For  example, in the experimental  work\r\n\r\nwhich  they  are  doing on the breeding  of  pigs  in\r\n\r\nflatted  buildings it was the Treasury that  insisted\r\n\r\nthat  they should set up a separate company in  order\r\n\r\nthat  all the elements of costs and of revenue  could\r\n\r\nbe properly accounted for so that one can see\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthe  distinction between what is being done  in  that\r\n\r\ncompany  and what would normally be done by  officers\r\n\r\nin  the  departments  of  the  Ministry  of  National\r\n\r\nDevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the accountability of the civil servants,\r\n\r\nthere  is some kind of impression that they  are  not\r\n\r\nsubject  to  any  control. The  fact  is  that  their\r\n\r\nperformances in these companies and in the  statutory\r\n\r\nboards are most certainly monitored by the people who\r\n\r\nappoint  them. In the case of the Ministry of Finance\r\n\r\ncompanies  and statutory boards, they report  to  the\r\n\r\nMinister for Finance. I think the basis of assessment\r\n\r\nof their performance is even more rigid because it is\r\n\r\nproperly  quantifiable by the profits which are  made\r\n\r\nin  companies  or by results in economic  development\r\n\r\nwhich  ensue from their appointments to the statutory\r\n\r\nboards. For example, I think a board as vital as  the\r\n\r\nEconomic  Development Board would  be  assessed  even\r\n\r\nmore   closely  than  a  normal  department  of   the\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to end my statement by a reference to the\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate of 6-8%. Some Members thought  that  the\r\n\r\ngrowth  rate was unduly optimistic, that  the  mildly\r\n\r\nrosy  nature of the consensus which has been  reached\r\n\r\nin  the OECD and elsewhere is not entirely justified.\r\n\r\nWell,  this  may be so. This is again  a  matter  for\r\n\r\nindividual judgment. In 1978, at about this  time  of\r\n\r\nthe  year,  I think we shall see whether or  not  the\r\n\r\nestimate  of 6-8% which we have made is correct.  The\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan has suggested that there\r\n\r\nshould  be  cautious optimism. I think we  are  being\r\n\r\ncautious, optimistic and, at the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsame time, realistic. We had a 7% growth rate as  the\r\n\r\npossible  growth for Singapore. We would be  cautious\r\n\r\nby  putting it at 6% and optimistic at 8%. So we said\r\n\r\n6-8%. On that basis we should not be too far off  the\r\n\r\nmark, But I think that this time next year I will  be\r\n\r\nable to know whether or not I was right, whether  the\r\n\r\nMember for Kampong Kembangan is satisfied, or whether\r\n\r\nthe  Member  for  Serangoon Gardens  was  correct  in\r\n\r\nsaying that it was too optimistic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close this debate, may I say that since the\r\n\r\nMember  for Kampong Kembangan has spoken of  football\r\n\r\nin  this  debate,  we all need to  have  the  highest\r\n\r\nmorale  in  the business of economic development  and\r\n\r\nthat  we,  Ministers and MPs, as well  as  the  Civil\r\n\r\nService,  should  try  to  maintain  this  very  high\r\n\r\nmorale.  Perhaps an Empress Place roar, in  the  same\r\n\r\nway  as  the  Kallang roar, will help to achieve  our\r\n\r\nobjective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament approves the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1st April, 1977 to 31st March, 1978.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"center\"><b>ADJOURNMENT</b></div>\r\n\r\n<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,\r\n\r\n\"That Parliament do now adjourn.\" - [Mr Hon Sui Sen]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><div align=\"right\">Adjourned accordingly at Twenty-eight minutes past</div>\r\n\r\n<div align=\"right\">Seven o'clock p.m.</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19770314/19770314-HA-0360903.pdf\"\">MAIN AND DEVELOPMENT ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 1ST APRIL, 1977 TO 31ST MARCH, 1978 (Cols. 903 - 906)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br><font size=\"1\"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><a  target='_blank'  href=\"/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1977/19770314/19770314-HA-0360907.pdf\"\">APPENDIX - COMPARISON OF TAX LIABILITIES AND DISPOSABLE INCOME BETWEEN 1972 AND 1976 (Cols. 907 - 908)</a><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "htmlContent": null, "subtitle": null, "sittingDate": null, "content": null, "mpNames": null, "htmlFileName": null, "verPdf": null, "footNotes": null, "footNoteQuestion": null, "footNoteQuestions": null, "footNote": [], "atbpList": [], "ptbaList": [], "attendanceList": [], "onlinePDFFileName": null, "pdfNodes": null, "clarificationText": null, "clarificationTitle": null, "clarificationSubTitle": null, "ptbaFrom": null, "ptbaTo": null, "questionCount": null}
